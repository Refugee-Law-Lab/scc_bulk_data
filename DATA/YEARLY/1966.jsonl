Reid (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1965: December 2, 3; 1966: January 25.\nPresent: Cartwright, Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nEasements\u2014Grant of right of way over stairway\u2014Covenant by servient owners to maintain and repair\u2014Building including stairway taken down by subsequent owners following fire\u2014Action for injunction to compel restoration of stairway and for damages dismissed.\nThe defendants were the owners of a lot which adjoined a lot owned by the plaintiff. In 1926 the predecessors in title of the defendants entered into an agreement under seal with the predecessor in title of the plaintiff with respect to a stairway that the former were constructing on their premises. The stairway was to lead to the second floor of their building and it was agreed that it should also lead to the second floor of the building on the adjacent lot. The parties of the first part, the defendants\u2019 predecessors in title, granted to the party of the second part, the plaintiff\u2019s predecessor in title, \u201cthe free and uninterrupted use and right of way to use the said stairway\u2026in common with the said parties of the first part at all times without any let, molestation or hindrance from the said parties of the first part, their heirs, executors, administrators and assigns\u201d. The parties of the first part also entered into a specific covenant to repair and to reconstruct in case of partial or total destruction of the stairway. On March 18, 1961, the defendants\u2019 building was badly damaged by fire, and, subsequently, the building including the stairway was taken down, for which the defendants accepted responsibility. In an action for an injunction to compel the restoration of the stairway and for damages, judgment was rendered in favour of the plaintiff. On appeal, the trial judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal, subject to a variation as to the amount of damages. Pursuant to leave granted by this Court, the defendants appealed from the judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nHeld (Spence J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.\nPer Cartwright, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.: As held by the Court of Appeal, there was no privity of contract between the plaintiff and the defendants, there was no privity of estate between them, and the covenant to repair and reconstruct the stairway did not run with the land.\nThe principle referred to by the Court below in dismissing the appeal, i.e., \u201cthe covenant to repair, which extends to the support of the thing demised, is quodammodo appurtenant to it, and goes with it\u201d, did not assist the plaintiff; the cases from which it is induced deal with leases or life tenancies where there is privity of estate. An obligation on the owner of the servient tenement to perform work on it would be inconsistent with the nature of an easement which as regards the servient owner is always negative, the obligation on him being either to suffer or not to do something.\nNeither Pomfret v. Ricroft (1669), 1 Wms. Saund. 321, nor Rider v. Smith (1790), 3 T.R. 766 (which cases are usually cited as authority for the proposition that the owner of the dominant tenement may, under the doctrine of prescription, claim to have the way repaired by the servient owner) established that a covenant contained in a grant of a right of way that the grantor will keep the way in repair was enforceable against a successor in ownership of the servient tenement. In the case at bar, the parties of the first part to the agreement were bound by their express covenant to keep the stairway in repair but the burden of that covenant did not run with the land so as to bind subsequent owners.\nAssuming that so long as the defendants made use of the westerly wall on the plaintiff\u2019s lot as a party-wall, as was provided for in earlier agreements, they were bound to keep the stairway in repair, they ceased to be under any such obligation when they no longer made use of that wall. Halsall v. Brizell, [1957] Ch. 169, referred to.\nPer Spence J., dissenting: The stairway was passable after the fire and the plaintiff could have continued to enjoy his right of way. It was, however, necessary to the defendants for the proper enjoyment of their property that the burned-out building be torn down; this tearing down entailed the destruction of the stairway and, therefore, the effective denial to the plaintiff of his right of way. The grant of the right of way and the covenant not to interfere with the right of way which such grant implied ran with the land and the plaintiff was entitled to the benefit, and the burden fell upon the defendants as successors in title to the original grantor. The defendants, by their action, terminated the right of way and the plaintiff was entitled to damages for that breach of his right of way.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming, subject to a variation as to the amount of damages, a judgment of Grant Co.Ct.J. Appeal allowed. SPENCE J. dissenting.\nWilliam Gray Dingwall, for the defendants, appellants.\nW.B. Williston, Q.C., and John Sopinka, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of Cartwright, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This appeal is brought, pursuant to leave granted by this Court, from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1 affirming, subject to a variation as to the amount of damages, a judgment of His Honour Judge Grant pronounced in the County Court of the County of Dufferin. That judgment as varied by the Court of Appeal reads, so far as relevant, as follows:\n1. THIS COURT DOTH ORDER AND ADJUDGE that the Defendants do forthwith restore the stairway referred to in the pleadings in such manner that the same can be used in the manner described in the agreement registered in the Registry Office for the Registry Division of the County of Dufferin on the seventeenth day of March, 1926, as number 12360 for the Town of Orangeville; AND DOTH AWARD the Plaintiff a mandatory injunction for the restoration of such stairway as aforesaid.\n2. AND THIS COURT DOTH FURTHER ORDER AND ADJUDGE that the Plaintiff do recover against the said Defendants the sum of Seven Hundred and Ninety-five dollars ($795.00) for special damages.\nThe appellants are the owners of lot 28 on the north side of Broadway Street in the Town of Orangeville according to plan number 47. The respondent is the owner of lot 29 on the same plan. These are adjoining lots, 28 being to the west of 29.\nOn January 8, 1926, Alexander B. Holmes and Frank J. Crowe, who were then the owners of lot 28 entered into an agreement under seal with John E. Sanderson who was then the owner of lot 29. Holmes and Crowe were the parties of the first part and Sanderson was the party of the second part. This agreement was registered on March 17, 1926, as number 12360; it recites the ownership of lots 28 and 29 and continues: AND WHEREAS the parties of the First Part are constructing a stairway to the second story of the building now on their said lands, the said stairway leading up to the second story from the north side of Broadway Street in the said Town of Orangeville immediately and adjacent to the westerly wall belonging to the said party of the Second Part and the said party of the Second Part, his respective heirs, executors, administrators and assigns are to have rights in common with the said parties of the First Part, their respective heirs, executors, administrators and assigns in the use of the said stairway, the said stairway shall also lead up to the second story of the building erected on the lands owned by the said party of the Second Part and along the westerly surface of the westerly wall of the said building now erected on the said lands owned by the said party of the Second Part.\nNOW THEREFORE THIS INDENTURE WITNESSETH that in consideration of the premises and the sum of One Hundred and Seventy-five Dollars now paid by the said party of the Second Part to the said parties of the First Part (the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged) they the said parties of the First Part do hereby grant unto the said party of the Second Part, his respective heirs, executors, administrators and assigns on the said lands of the parties hereto of the First Part the free and uninterrupted use and right of way to use the said stairway herein described in common with the said parties of the First Part at all times without any let, molestation or hindrance from the said parties of the First Part, their heirs, executors, administrators and assigns.\nThe parties of the First Part covenant and agree with the party of the Second Part as follows:\nThe said stairway shall be constructed by the parties of the First Part and ready for use on or before the first day of March, A.D. 1926 and the said parties of the First Part agree with the said party of the Second Part to construct the said stairway in a good workmanlike manner using material which shall be proper, fit and adapted for the traffic required up and down the said stairway by either of the parties hereto. The said stairway shall be three (3) feet six (6) inches wide and completely built for the traffic required for same from the sidewalk up and leading into the door of the second story of the building erected on the said lands of the said party of the Second Part, and there shall be a suitable landing at the head of the said stairway for entrance into the second story of the said building erected on the said lands of the said party of the Second Part.\nThe said parties of the First Part covenant and agree with the said party of the Second Part that they shall keep the said stairway in good repair and re-construct the same in the event of partial or total destruction thereof so as it can be used safely for traffic up and down the said stairway by the said party of the Second Part.\nAND it is agreed that the covenants herein contained shall run with the lands, but no covenant herein contained shall be personally binding on any person except in respect of breaches during his or their seisin or title to the said lands.\nIt is common ground that the stairway was constructed in accordance with the agreement and that the $175 was paid.\nBy deed dated December 29, 1936, Sanderson conveyed lot 29 to the respondent in fee simple,\ntogether with all rights of the grantor as set out in Instrument 12360 for the said Town of Orangeville and covering a portion of lot 28 plan 47 aforesaid. By deed dated April 1, 1946, Alexander B. Holmes and Margaret Elizabeth Crowe, the devisee of Frank J. Crowe, conveyed lot 28 to Telford Sinclair Parkinson in fee simple,\ntogether with all the rights and privileges and subject to the obligations contained in the agreements registered as numbers 5294, 5330, 6134, 6518 and 12360 respectively.\nTelford Sinclair Parkinson died on October 9, 1957, and lot 28 devolved upon the appellants under the terms of his will.\nOn March 18, 1961, the building on lot 28 was badly damaged by fire. Mr. Kyles, an architect, testified that he recommended that the building be taken down. His evidence reads in part:\nQ. In your opinion, would it have been safe to leave the stairway as it existed after the fire?\nA. Well, you could not leave the stairway or the building. We recommended that the entire building be taken down. You could re-erect it with new supports. You couldn\u2019t leave the stairway. You could take it down and re-erect it with new supports, but you couldn\u2019t leave it. You couldn\u2019t remove the rest of the building and leave it there.\nThis evidence was not weakened on cross-examination and was not contradicted. The building including the stairway was taken down and counsel for the appellants stated at the opening of his argument that the appellants accept the responsibility for doing this.\nIt is clear, however, that the cause of the stairway being no longer available for the use of the respondent was the destruction by fire of the appellants\u2019 building of which the stairway formed part.\nThe statement of claim sets out the ownership of lots 28 and 29, the chain of title, the agreement number 12360, the removal of the stairway in March 1961, requests by the plaintiff that the defendants replace the stairway, their neglect and refusal to do so and concludes with a prayer for a mandatory injunction and damages.\nThe statement of defence says that the building of which the stairway was a part was destroyed by fire and continues:\nThe defendants further say, as the fact is, that there is no privity of contract between the plaintiff and the defendants, and that the defendants are under no obligation in law to replace the said stairway which was destroyed by fire. There is no dispute as to the relevant facts. The question to be decided is one of law.\nThe reasons for judgment of the Court of Appeal were delivered by Kelly J.A. After reciting the facts he held, (i) that there was no privity of contract between the plaintiff and the defendants, (ii) that there was no privity of estate between them and, (iii) that the covenant to repair and reconstruct the stairway did not run with the land. I agree with the views of the learned Justice of Appeal on these three points. They do not require elaboration. As to the third point the law is accurately and succinctly stated in Gale on Easements, 12th ed. at p. 77 as follows:\nThe rule in Tulk v. Moxhay does not extend to affirmative covenants requiring the expenditure of money or the doing of some act. Such covenants do not run with the land either at law or in equity. The doctrine only applies to covenants which are negative in substance though they may be positive in form.\nHowever, Kelly J.A. went on to hold the plaintiff entitled to succeed on three grounds.\nThe first of these was that the easement created by instrument 12360 was not a mere right of passage over a portion of the surface of the servient tenement but was a right to pass over a structure the terminus of which was at the level of the second story of the building on the dominant tenement, that the easement would be incapable of enjoyment unless the stairway was maintained in a safe state of repair and that the provision for its repair was an inherent part of the easement. Having said this the learned Justice of Appeal quoted from Broom\u2019s Legal Maxims, 10th ed., p. 482, as follows:\n\u2026the covenant to repair, which extends to the support of the thing demised, is quodammodo appurtenant to it, and goes with it;\u2026\nWith respect, I do not think that the principle stated in this quotation assists the respondent; the cases from which it is induced deal with leases or life tenancies where there is privity of estate. An obligation on the owner of the servient tenement to perform work on it would be inconsistent with the nature of an easement which as regards the servient owner is always negative, the obligation on him being either to suffer or not to do something. (vide Jowitt, Dictionary of English Law, vol. 1, p. 690). The second ground was based on the cases of Pomfret v. Ricroft[2] and Rider v. Smith[3]. These cases are usually cited as authority for the proposition that the owner of the dominant tenement may, under the doctrine of prescription, claim to have the way repaired by the servient owner, but I do not read either of them as establishing that a covenant contained in a grant of a right of way that the grantor will keep the way in repair is enforceable against a successor in ownership of the servient tenement. No case in which it was actually so decided was cited to us.\nBoth Pomfret v. Ricroft and Rider v. Smith are cited in the foot-notes to the following passage in Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England, 3rd ed., vol. 12, p. 579, para. 1256:\nAs a general rule the owner of the servient tenement is under no liability to repair the way over which a right of way has been granted, for such a liability is not a condition incident by law to the grant of a right of way; nor is it even a legal obligation incumbent on the grantee. The person entitled to the use of the way must do such repairs as he requires, and has a right of entry upon the servient tenement for that purpose.\nIn the case at bar, no doubt, the parties of the first part in instrument 12360 were bound by their express covenant to keep the stairway in repair but I have already expressed my view that the burden of that covenant which is the basis of the respondent\u2019s claim did not run with the land so as to bind subsequent owners of lot 28.\nThe third ground was based on the maxim, Qui sentit commodum sentire debet et onus. It was said that as the appellants\u2019 predecessor in title, Telford Sinclair Parkinson, and the appellants themselves, had enjoyed the privileges contained in the agreements registered as numbers 5294, 5330, 6134, and 6518 referred to in the deed dated April 1, 1946, in part recited above, they could not refuse to perform the obligations contained in the agreement 12360. The first four mentioned agreements were not put in evidence but counsel for the appellants, for the purposes of this appeal, was willing to admit that they conferred on the owners of lot 28 the right to use the westerly wall on lot 29 as a party-wall.\nAssuming that so long as the appellants made use of the last-mentioned wall as a party-wall they were bound to keep the stairway in repair, they ceased to be under any such obligation when they no longer made use of the respondent\u2019s wall. It is not suggested that the appellants have made any use of that wall since their building was destroyed by fire. A case in which this principle was applied is Halsall v. Brizell[4] which was discussed in the reasons of Kelly J.A.\nFor the above reasons I am of opinion that since the time when the building on lot 28 was destroyed the appellants have been under no obligation enforceable at law or in equity to replace the stairway.\nI would allow the appeal, with costs throughout, including the costs of the motion for leave to appeal, set aside the judgments in the Court of Appeal and at the trial and direct that judgment be entered dismissing the action; the respondent will recover from the appellants the costs of the motion to quash the appeal.\nSPENCE J. (dissenting):\u2014I have had the privilege of reading the reasons of my brother Cartwright. I agree with the conclusions of law outlined therein but on the peculiar circumstances present in this case I have come to a different result.\nFirstly, it must be noted that by Instrument No. 12360 the parties of the first part, the predecessors in title of the appellants here, granted unto the party of the second part, the predecessor in title of the respondent here, \u201cthe free and uninterrupted use and right of way to use the said stairway herein described in common with the said parties of the first part at all times without any let, molestation or hindrance from the said parties of the first part, their heirs, executors, administrators and assigns\u201d. It is also true that the parties of the first part entered into a specific covenant to repair and to reconstruct in case of partial or total destruction of the stairway. I shall concern myself with the grant of the right of way alone as, for the purposes of these reasons, the covenant to maintain and repair may be ignored.\nAccording to the evidence of the plaintiff, here respondent, a fire occurred in the premises of the appellants on March 18, 1961. That fire seems to have been fiercest on the west side of the property, i.e., the side farthest away from the property owned by the plaintiff, here respondent. The plaintiff swore that from the day of the fire until the defendants commenced to wreck the building on April 27, 1961, his tenant continued to use the stairway, which is the subject-matter of this action, for the purpose of gaining access to the apartment on the second floor.\nJohn Douglas Kyles, the architect employed by the defendants to advise them, was asked in direct examination:\nQ. You could get up the stairs?\nA. The east stairs. I don\u2019t know whether you could get in the west stairs\u2026\nHe further testified that at the time he considered the building should be entirely torn down as the damage extended into every part of the building and that there was nothing he could see that could be saved. He further testified:\nA. Well, you could not leave the stairway or the building. We recommended that the entire building be taken down. You could re-erect it with new supports. You couldn\u2019t leave the stairway. You could take it down and re-erect it with new supports, but you couldn\u2019t leave it. You couldn\u2019t remove the rest of the building and leave it there.\nJohn Knox Henry, called by the defendant, was the contractor who had wrecked the defendants\u2019 building. When he was asked in direct examination if he had looked at the stairway at all, his answer was:\nA. Where the stairway was, there wasn\u2019t any fire there. That was next to Mr. Reid\u2019s, the brick wall where you entered the stairway where the danger was\u2026\nQ. What about the entrance to the stairway?\nA. It was quite dangerous.\nThe situation would appear therefore to be that this stairway was passable after the fire and that the plaintiff, here respondent, could have continued to enjoy his right of way. It was, however, necessary to the defendants for the proper enjoyment of their property that the burned-out building be torn down and this tearing down entailed the destruction of the stairway and, therefore, the effective denial to the plaintiff of his right of way. The grant of the right of way and the covenant not to interfere with the right of way which such grant implies do, of course, run with the land and the plaintiff, here respondent, was entitled to the benefit, and the burden fell upon the appellants as successors in title to the original grantor. The appellants, by their action, terminated the right of way and the plaintiff is entitled to damages for that breach of his right of way.\nI cannot understand that the fact that the appellants had to destroy that stairway in order to properly utilize their own lands would provide any excuse:\nIn the Court of Appeal, the appeal of the present appellants was dismissed with costs. The formal judgment of that Court varied para. 2 of the judgment of Grant Co.Ct.J. to provide that the damages should be $795 although by the judgment of the County Court Judge such damages had been fixed at $570 for special damages and $1,200 for general damages. The reason for this variation does not appear in the record. It might well be that the Court of Appeal has felt that the sum awarded in its formal judgment compensates for the damages which the plaintiff suffered from interference with his right of way.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs, SPENCE J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the defendants, appellants: Willis, Dingwall & Newell, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: Church & Church, Orangeville.\n[1] [1965] 1 O.R. 117, 47 D.L.R.

Manitoba Hydro-electric Board, [1966] S.C.R. 229\nDate: 1966-01-25\nThomas Lamb (Applicant) Appellant;\nand\nThe Manitoba Hydro-Electric Board (Respondent) Respondent.\n1965: October 14, 15; 1966: January 25.\nPresent: Fauteux, Martland, Judson, Hall and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR MANITOBA\nExpropriation\u2014Minimum of evidence upon which to fix value\u2014Potentiality of land at time of taking\u2014Compensation payable\u2014The Expropriation Act, R.S.M. 1954, c. 78.\nCertain lands and buildings belonging to the appellant and located in an area consisting partly of lowlying land and partly of high land were expropriated by the Manitoba Hydro-Electric Board, pursuant to The Manitoba Hydro Act, 1961 (Man.), c. 28. The expropriation of the lowlying lands was essential to the carrying out of a major hydro-electric project, and that part of the appellant's property which consisted of high land was acquired as a townsite for people who were displaced by the flooding of the lowlands. The appellant was not satisfied with the amount offered as compensation and arbitration proceedings followed. The parties having reached an agreement as to the compensation payable for injurious affection, the arbitrator had to concern himself only with fixing compensation for the value of the lands and buildings. He awarded $8,350 for the lands together with compensation for the buildings. On appeal to the Court of Appeal the Court affirmed the values allowed on the land and allowed the respondent's cross-appeal excluding any allowance for two of the buildings.\nHeld (Fauteux and Judson JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed in part.\nPer Martland, Hall and Spence JJ.: The fact that there was, from the very nature of things in a case of this kind where lands in a remote area were being valued, a minimum of evidence upon which the arbitrator could fix values did not relieve him of the responsibility of determining the value to be placed on the lands taken, having regard to the evidence that was actually before him and all the circumstances surrounding the taking of the lands and the potentialities of the land at the time of taking. Raja Vyricherla Narayana Gajapatiraju v. Revenue Divisional Officer, Vizagapatam, [1939] A.C. 302, applied.\nAccordingly, taking into consideration the potentiality of the appellant's high ground as a townsite along with the other evidence that was before the arbitrator, it was concluded that the values fixed by him and approved by the Court of Appeal were much too low. The highlands should be valued at $1,800 an acre and the lowlands at $600 an acre, making a total of $26,484.\nPer curiam: The appeal as to the buildings, which were located on a road allowance and not on property owned by the appellant or expropriated from him, should be dismissed.\nPer Fauteux and Judson JJ., dissenting: The appellant's high land was taken to resettle a local population that could not help itself. There was no market for this land in the locality, and there was no evidence that any outsider would come in to develop it. A reasonable value was attributed to it in the assessments of the arbitrator and the Court of Appeal for the purpose of the proposed townsite.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1] , dismissing an appeal and allowing a crossappeal from an arbitration award in expropriation proceedings. Appeal allowed in part, Fauteux and Judson JJ. dissenting.\nW. C. Newman, Q.C.,and L.Baird, for the appellant.\nA.S. Dewar, Q.C.,and J. P. Funnell, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Fauteux and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nJUDSON J. (dissenting in part):\u2014Both the learned arbitrator and a unanimous Court of Appeal[2] are in agreement on the compensation to be awarded for the high land in this expropriation. The figures are:\nParcel No. 1, 11.22 acres\n$ 5,800.00\nParcel No. 3, 1.44 acres\n750 . 00\nTotal\n$ 6,550.00\nThe land was taken to resettle a local population that could not help itself. Their modest dwellings had been taken for the purpose of flooding and they were in no position to purchase lots on the high land and to build on them. There was no market among them for land of any kind. The claimant asked to have applied a novel principle of valuation,\u2014what it would cost the Manitoba HydroElectric Board to develop a townsite at some other location to accommodate the displaced persons.\nAs the Manitoba Court of Appeal pointed out, we are concerned here only with waste land or virgin farm land. There was no market for it in the locality. There was no evidence that any outsider would come in to develop it. A reasonable value was attributed to it for the purpose of the proposed townsite. It was not expropriated as waste land or virgin land. The Court of Appeal said:\nSo far as the high land of the applicant here is concerned it, in itself, has no physical value or special adaptability or potentiality such as had the land with the spring or the land with the rock. Indeed it seems obvious that in the Indian.case and the Fraser case the primary objective of the expropriations was in the one case to acquire the rock and the other the spring. The taking of the land was incidental. Here we have simply waste land or virgin farm land, but increased to the value attributed to it by the learned County Court Judge by reason of the proposed townsite development.\nI can see no error either in principle or in amount in the assessments of the arbitrator and the Court of Appeal. There is no ground for interference. I would dismiss the appeal with costs and affirm the disallowance in the Court of Appeal of the compensation of $3,250 for a garage, boat-shed and storage-shed which were not on land owned by the claimant.\nThe judgment of Martland, Hall and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nHALL J.:\u2014Early in the year 1960 the Government of Manitoba decided to build a major hydro-electric project at Grand Rapids where the Saskatchewan River empties into Lake Winnipeg some 15 miles north of Latitude 53\u00b0 . The project was to be executed by the respondent, the Manitoba Hydro-electric Board, a public body exercising the powers conferred on it by The Manitoba Hydro Act, 1961 (Man.), c. 28.\nCompletion of the project would involve flooding a considerable area of land to the west and northwest of Grand Rapids. The water level of the area to be flooded would cover all land below the 848-feet contour level.\nThe area or location involved in this appeal lies some 60 miles northwest of Grand Rapids in a settlement known as Moose Lake located on the southwest shore of Moose Lake which is a part of the Saskatchewan River watershed. It is a settlement 40 miles east of The Pas, Manitoba, accessible only by air or by water. It is of some local importance with educational and religious amenities and a population of approximately 600, consisting principally of M\u00e9tis, Treaty Indians and some whites. It was originally a Hudson's Bay Company trading post. The two most important industries in the area are fishing and trapping.\nThe appellant Lamb is the son of a pioneer trader in the district. He grew up and remained in Moose Lake to be, in succession, the operator of a saw mill, a muskrat ranch and a cattle ranch. At the time in question in this action, he was carrying on a freighting business by air and tractor (winter) and by boat and barge as well as a general store. In 1916 appellant's father acquired the land in question in this action from the Hudson's Bay Company. Appellant bought it from his father in 1926 or 1927. The Moose Lake settlement site consists of a lowlying area adjacent to the lake and an area of high ground unaffected by the level of the lake and well above the 848-feet contour level.\nCompletion of the Grand Rapids project necessarily involved raising the level of Moose Lake and flooding the lowlying lands of the settlement adjacent thereto. These lowlying lands were occupied mainly by M\u00e9tis and Treaty Indians, who, on being flooded out or on being advised that they would be flooded out, had to find other lands to move to or leave the settlement. The respondent Board had the right to expropriate these lands and did so by means of registration of a plan that was filed in Neepawa Land Titles Office on October 17, 1962, at 9:35 a.m. as Plan No. 4799.\nThe respondent had no legal responsibility towards those displaced by the flooding of the lowlying lands other than to compensate them for any loss occasioned to them. However, instead of leaving them to fend for themselves, a humane and enlightened approach was adopted towards the M\u00e9tis and Indians so displaced. The Government of Manitoba, acting through the respondent and by virtue of the power contained in s. 16(b) of The Manitoba Hydro Act, decided to acquire the high ground in the Moose Lake settlement as a townsite for these displaced people and it proceeded to expropriate lands belonging to the appellant Lamb by a Notice of Expropriation filed in the Neepawa Land Titles Office on October 12, 1962, at 9:25 a.m. as No. 129044. Notice of the expropriation was given to the appellant by a notice dated November 14, 1962. Subsequently a second Notice of Expropriation dated January 24, 1963, was served upon the appellant in which compensation was offered in the sum of $18,725 made up as follows:\nLot B and Lots 1 to 3 both inclusive, 10 to 13 both\ninclusive, 18, 19 and 27 of Parcel 1\n$ 2,150.00\nParcel 2\n725.00\nParcel 3\n75.00\nParcel 4\n250.00\nCost of re-locating sewage disposal field\n525.00\nInjurious affection or consequential damage\n15,000.00\n$18,725.00 The appellant notified the respondent that he was not satisfied with the amount offered, thus bringing into operation the provisions of The Expropriation Act, R.S.M. 1954, c. 78. His Honour Frank W. Newman, County Court Judge, was appointed arbitrator to fix the compensation payable to the appellant. Meanwhile, as a result of negotiations between the parties, an agreement had been reached where by compensation payable under the heading of injurious affection or consequential damage and the cost of relocating the sewage disposal field was agreed upon in the sum of $18,000. The arbitrator had, therefore, to concern himself only with fixing compensation for the value of the lands taken and for certain buildings belonging to the appellant. Section 65 of The Expropriation Act under which the arbitrator had to proceed reads as follows:\n65. (1) In estimating the amount to which the claimant is entitled, the arbitrator shall consider and find separately as to the following,\n(a) the value of the land and all improvements thereon;\n(b) the damage, if any, to the remaining property of the claimant; and\n(c) the original cost only of any extra fencing that may be necessary by reason of the taking of the land.\n(2) Where part only of the land of an owner is expropriated, there shall be included in the compensation a sum sufficient to compensate him for any damages directly resulting from severance.\n(3) Where the value of the remaining land of the claimant is increased by the construction of the works through his land, by the extension of the same in any direction, or by the construction of any other works in connection therewith, the increase in value shall be deducted from the amount to which the claimant would otherwise be entitled, and the balance, if any, shall be the amount awarded to him.\nThe area of lowlying land was 6.16 acres and the highland contained 11.22 acres. In addition, the appellant claimed an interest in 36 lots of an area of 4.3 acres, being lots which he had sold and agreed to transfer to employees for a nominal sum under a special form of agreement, Exhibit 7. This claim and the appellant's claim for buildings will be dealt with separately.\nThe appellant Lamb asked for compensation in the sum of $150,000 for the 17.38 acres of high and low land in addition to the agreed compensation of $18,000 for injurious affection as stated above. The basis upon which the appellant arrived at this figure was that it would cost the expropriating authority $150,000 to develop a similar townsite elsewhere on the assumption that there would be a comparable townsite available. There is, of course, no basis in law for estimating the value of the lands in this way. The arbitrator had evidence from a Mr. Farstad, a qualified appraiser called on behalf of the appellant, who testified that $34,580 would be a fair and reasonable valuation to place upon the lands taken and $5,000 for the buildings. For the respondent, Mr. Townsend, who was also a qualified appraiser, testified that in his opinion the lands should be valued at $3,950 and the buildings at $3,250. Jock McAree, the appellant's son-in-law, valued the lands at $74,050 and the buildings at $8,600. The arbitrator properly disregarded McAree's valuation of the lands as unrealistic.\nThere was a dearth of evidence as to values obtainable from sales of land in the area in question. There was evidence of one sale in April 1956, of .89 acres by the appellant to the Government of Canada shown as Lot \"R\" on Plan 4413 at a price of $400 or about $480 an acre. There was also evidence of a sale by one Alex Knight to John Bodnar, a storekeeper and business rival of the appellant whose property had also been expropriated and who needed a new storesite in January 1964, of part of Lot 14, Plan 522, being about one-quarter acre in area for $1,500 or at the rate of $6,000 an acre. This sale was more than a year after the appellant's land had been taken, but it was a bona fide sale from one business man to another in the Moose Lake settlement. The arbitrator gave no weight to this sale, saying he \"assumed that Lamb would not sell him (Bodnar) a site at any price.\" There was no evidence to this effect. This Knight-Bodnar sale cannot be taken as being any more decisive in fixing land values at the relevant time than the sale to the Government in 1956, but neither should it have been ignored by the arbitrator, and in my view he was in error in so doing.\nThe arbitrator awarded the appellant the sum of $8,350 for the lands.\nThe fact that there is, from the very nature of things in a case of this kind where lands in a remote area are being valued, a minimum of evidence upon which the arbitrator can fix values does not relieve him of the responsibility of determining the value to be placed on the lands taken, having regard to the evidence that is actually before him and all the circumstances surrounding the taking of the lands and the potentialities of the land at the time of the taking. The official announcement of the decision to undertake the Grand Rapids project that inevitably involved the flooding of the lowlying land in question was announced by the Premier of Manitoba in the Speech from the Throne in the Manitoba Legislature on January 19, 1960, some 2 1\/2 years before the actual expropriation proceedings were undertaken.\nThe expropriation of the lowlying lands was essential to the carrying out of the Grand Rapids hydro-electric project. However, the expropriation of the high ground was a collateral act arising out of the Grand Rapids project but not necessarily essential thereto.\nOnce the Grand Rapids project was embarked upon and it was known that the lowlying areas up to the 848-feet level were to be flooded, the appellant's high ground at Moose Lake acquired a potentiality as a townsite, in fact the only one in the Moose Lake settlement area.\nIn these circumstances, the observations of Lord Romer in Raja Vyricherla Narayana Gajapatiraju v. Revenue Divisional Officer, Vizagapatam[3] are relevant here. In that case a harbour was being constructed at Vizagapatam. Land acquired by the harbour authorities on the south of the harbour was allocated by them to oil companies and other industrial concerns. This land was malarious. The appellant's land, which was to the south of this land, contained a spring which yielded a constant and abundant supply of good drinking water which could easily be made available for the oil companies and people engaged in the harbour works. The appellant's land was acquired for the purpose of the execution of anti-malarial works. The appellant claimed compensation on the footing of the potentialities of the land as a building site. The Land Acquisition Officer disallowed this claim and awarded compensation on a valuation of the land as partly waste and partly cultivated with an allowance for some buildings and trees.\nOn the appellant's application, the matter was, under the Act, referred to the Subordinate Judge. Before him the appellant made a further claim on the footing of potentialities as a source of water supply.\nThe Subordinate Judge held that the water could be sold to the oil companies and others at a profit, that the only possible buyers were the oil companies and the harbour authorities and that compensation for potentialities could be awarded, even where the only possible buyer is the acquiring authority, and he assessed the value of the potentialities and made his award accordingly. He found against the potentialities of the land as a building site.\nOn appeal, the High Court set aside the award of the Subordinate Judge and restored that of the Land Acquisition Officer, holding that the supply of drinking water had no value apart from the scheme for which the acquisition was made and the Harbour Authorities were the only possible purchasers, and that the land had no potentialities as a building site.\nOn a further appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, Lord Romer said at p. 313:\nIn such a case the arbitrator in determining its value will have no market value to guide him, and he will have to ascertain as best he may from the materials before him, what a willing vendor might reasonably expect to obtain from a willing purchaser, for the land in that particular position and with those particular potentialities. For it has been established by numerous authorities that the land is not to be valued merely by reference to the use to which it is being put at the time at which its value has to be determined (that time under the Indian Act being the date of the notification under s. 4, sub-s. I), but also by reference to the uses to which it is reasonably capable of being put in the future. No authority indeed is required for this proposition. It is a self-evident one. No one can suppose in the case of land which is certain, or even likely, to be used in the immediate or reasonably near future for building purposes, but which at the valuation date is waste land or is being used for agricultural purposes, that the owner, however willing a vendor, will be content to sell the land for its value as waste or agricultural land as the case may be. It is plain that, in ascertaining its value, the possibility of its being used for building purposes would have to be taken into account. It is equally plain, however, that the land must not be valued as though it had already been built upon, a proposition that is embodied in s. 24, sub-s. 5, of the Act and is sometimes expressed by saying that it is the possibilities of the land and not its realized possibilities that must be taken into consideration.\nand at pp. 329-330:\nIt remains to deal with s. 24, sub-s. 5, of the Land Acquisition Act. That sub-section as applied to the present case means no more than this: that in valuing the appellant's land on February 13, 1928, it must be valued as it then stood, and not as it would stand when the land had been acquired and the water on it used for ridding the harbour area of malaria. The Harbour Authority would otherwise be made to pay for the water twice over. But the sub-section does not mean that the possibility that a particular purchaser of land will give a higher price for it by reason of its possessing a special adaptability must be disregarded merely because the land will be more valuable in his hands when he exploits that adaptability than it would be if left in the hands of the vendor who was unable to exploit it. In Clay's case [1914] 1 K.B. 339, for instance, the house after being added to the nurses' home was no doubt more valuable than it was before. That, indeed, was the reason why the trustees of the home paid 250E. more than any other purchaser would have paid. The house in that case was held to be of the value of 1000E., not because that was its value after being put to the use for which it was acquired, but because that was the price which the willing purchaser was prepared to pay for its acquisition. In the present case the land must be valued not at the sum it would be worth after it had been acquired by the Harbour Authority and used for anti-malarial purposes, but at the sum that the Authority \"in a friendly negotiation\" (to use Lord Johnston's words) would be willing to pay on February 13, 1928, in order to acquire it for those purposes.\nAccordingly, taking into consideration the potentiality of the appellant's high ground as a townsite along with the other evidence that was before the arbitrator, I conclude that the values fixed by him and approved by the Court of Appeal[4] are much too low. In my opinion the highlands should be valued at $1,800 an acre for an amount of $22,788 for the 12.66 acres, the lowlying lands at $600 an acre for an amount of $3,696 for the 6.16 acres, making a total of $26,484.\nThe appellant's claim for compensation in respect of an interest in the 36 lots previously sold to employees for a nominal amount under Exhibit 7 previously referred to is too indefinite and speculative. The arbitrator was right in disallowing that claim.\nThe buildings claimed for remain to be dealt with. The arbitrator awarded $3,250 for them. In the Court of Appeal the respondent cross-appealed against this allowance for the buildings on the ground that the buildings in question were located on a road allowance and not on property owned by the appellant or expropriated from him. The appellant conceded that the buildings were in fact on the road allowance. Miller C.J.M. dealt with the buildings claim as follows:\nThe garage and boat-shed valued at $3,000 and the storage-shed valued at $250 by the learned County Court Judge are built almost entirely on a road allowance although encroaching slightly on adjoining parcels, but these adjoining parcels were not expropriated from or owned by Lamb. Therefore, counsel contends, the buildings thereon cannot be considered in these proceedings, or, if they are to be considered, they would come under the heading of a claim for consequential damage or injurious affection, which has already been settled at the sum of $18,000 as above set out. The Expropriation Act, s. 12(1), requires the Minister to pay compensation to the owner of the land entered upon, but as the Manitoba Hydro-electric Board is not, as against Lamb as owner, entering upon any of the land on which the buildings or any part thereof are located, then the buildings are not \"land being expropriated\" and do not have to be paid for by the Minister. This argument is virtually unanswerable, and, much as I would like to maintain for the owner the value of these buildings as awarded to him by the learned County Court Judge, yet the statute law is against such a finding. I therefore conclude that the cross-appeal must be allowed. As to whether Lamb is entitled to any other relief in respect of these buildings outside these proceedings need not presently be determined.\nI agree with this finding. The appeal, therefore, fails as to the buildings. The award of the arbitrator should be varied by substituting an award of $26,484 for the lands taken with interest as provided in The Expropriation Act from the date of taking.\nThe appellant is entitled to his costs in this Court and in the Court of Appeal. The respondent is entitled to its costs of the cross-appeal in the Court of Appeal. The appellant must pay the costs of the arbitration proceedings as ordered by the arbitrator.\nAppeal allowed in part with costs, FAUTEUX and JUDSON JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Newman, MacLean & Associates, Winnipeg.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Thompson, Dilts & Co., Winnipeg.\n[1] (1965), 50 W.W.R. 231, 48 D.L.R.

By way of a stated case brought by the appellant, the magistrate submitted for the opinion of the Supreme Court of Ontario the questions whether he erred in law in (1) finding that s. 60 of the Highway Traffic Act was not ultra vires, and (2) finding that there was no conflict between that section and s. 221(4) of the Criminal Code. Mr. Justice Haines ruled that s. 60 was valid provincial legislation but in conflict with s. 221(4) of the Criminal Code, and set aside the conviction. The Court of Appeal answered both questions in the negative and restored the conviction. The appellant was granted leave to appeal to this Court. Leave to intervene in this appeal was granted to the Attorney General of Canada, the Attorney General for Quebec and the Attorney General for Manitoba.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Cartwright and Spence JJ.: The decision of this Court in O\u2019Grady v. Sparling, [1960] S.C.R. 804, which dealt with a similar legislation in. Manitoba, makes it clear that s. 60 of the Highway Traffic Act was within the powers of the provincial legislature. In enacting s. 221 of the Criminal Code, Parliament has not defined \u201cinadvertent negligence\u201d as a crime. Consequently since parliament has not occupied the field covered by s. 60, that section does not cease to be operative. The present case was undistinguishable from O\u2019Grady v. Sparling.\nPer Fauteux, Abbott and Judson JJ.: The provisions of s. 60 of the Highway Traffic Act and s. 221(4) of the Criminal Code differ in legislative purpose and legal and practical effect. The provincial enactment imposes a duty to serve bona fide ends not otherwise secured and in no way conflicting with the federal enactment. There were no obstacles preventing both enactments living together and operating concurrently.\nPer Martland, Judson and Eitchie JJ.: The purpose and effect of s. 221(4) is to make it a criminal offence for any one to drive to the public danger, but there is a type of careless and inconsiderate driving which falls short of being \u201cdangerous\u201d within the meaning of that section, and the purpose of s. 60 of the Highway Traffic Act is to provide appropriate sanctions for the regulation and control of such driving in the interests of the lawful users of the highways.\nSection 60 of the Highway Traffic Act and s. 221(4) of the Criminal Code deal with different subject matters and were enacted for different purposes, and this case is therefore governed by O\u2019Grady v. Sparling.\nPer Spence J.: By the enactment of s. 221(4) of the Criminal Code, Parliament has not moved into the field of inadvertent negligence and therefore there is no repugnancy between that section and s. 60 of the Highway Traffic Act which would render the latter section inoperative. Although there may be overlapping between the two sections, the consequence is not repugnance. The two sections deal with different subjects and therefore they may stand together.\nDroit constitutionnel\u2014Droit criminels\u2014Offense provinciale de conduite n\u00e9gligente d\u2019automobile\u2014Y a-t-il conflit avec l\u2019offense de conduite dangereuse telle que d\u00e9finie par le Code criminel\u2014Highway Traffic Act, S.R.O. 1960, c. 172, art. 60\u2014Code criminel, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, art. 221(4).\nL\u2019appelant fut trouv\u00e9 coupable sous un chef d\u2019accusation d\u2019avoir conduit une automobile de fa\u00e7on n\u00e9gligente, contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019art. 60 du Highway Traffic Act, S.R.O. 1960, c. 172. En vertu d\u2019un dossier soumis par l\u2019appelant, le magistrat a saisi la Cour supr\u00eame de l\u2019Ontario des questions de savoir s\u2019il avait err\u00e9 en droit (1) en jugeant que l\u2019art. 60 du Highway Traffic Act n\u2019\u00e9tait pas ultra vires, et (2) en jugeant qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas conflit entre cet article et l\u2019art. 221(4) du Code criminel. Le Juge Haines a jug\u00e9 que l\u2019art. 60 \u00e9tait une l\u00e9gislation provinciale valide mais qu\u2019il y avait conflit avec l\u2019art. 221(4) du Code criminel, et a mis de c\u00f4t\u00e9 le verdict de culpabilit\u00e9. La Cour d\u2019Appel a r\u00e9pondu n\u00e9gativement aux deux questions et a r\u00e9tabli le verdict de culpabilit\u00e9. L\u2019appelant a obtenu permission d\u2019appeler devant cette Cour.

Sparling, [1960] R.C.S. 804, qui a trait\u00e9 d\u2019une l\u00e9gislation semblable venant du Manitoba, d\u00e9montre clairement que l\u2019art. 60 du Highway Traffic Act \u00e9tait de la comp\u00e9tence de la L\u00e9gislature provinciale. En d\u00e9cr\u00e9tant l\u2019art. 221 du Code criminel, le Parlement n\u2019a pas d\u00e9fini \u201cla n\u00e9gligence inattentive\u201d comme \u00e9tant un crime. En cons\u00e9quence, puisque le Parlement n\u2019a pas pris possession du domaine couvert par l\u2019art. 60, cet article ne cesse pas d\u2019avoir effet. On ne peut pas distinguer la cause pr\u00e9sente de O\u2019Grady v. Sparling.\nLes Juges Fauteux, Abbott et Judson: Les dispositions de l\u2019art. 60 du Highway Traffic Act et de l\u2019art. 221(4) du Code criminel diff\u00e8rent dans leur but l\u00e9gislatif et dans leur effet l\u00e9gal et pratique. La Loi provinciale tente d\u2019obtenir des fins bona fide non autrement atteintes par et non en conflit avec la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.

Quoiqu\u2019il puisse y avoir double emploi entre les deux articles, la cons\u00e9quence n\u2019est pas l\u2019incompatibilit\u00e9.

MacDonald, Q.C., and Jon van der Woerd, for the Attorney General of Canada. R.A. Cormack, Q.C., and C.M. Powell, for the respondent.\nG\u00e9rald Le Dain, Q.C., for the Attorney General for Quebec.\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This appeal raises the question whether s. 60 of the Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 172, has ceased to be operative since the enactment by Parliament of s. 221(4) of the Criminal Code.\nOn May 12, 1964, the appellant was convicted by Deputy Magistrate Hamilton on the charge that he did on February 14, 1964, at Toronto, commit the offence of driving carelessly a vehicle on a highway contrary to s. 60 of the Highway Traffic Act.\nOn the application of the appellant the learned Magistrate stated a case submitting for the opinion of the Court the questions whether he erred in law in:\n1. Finding that section 60 of the Highway Traffic Act was not ultra vires;\n2. Finding that there was no conflict between section 60 of the Highway Traffic Act and section 221(4) of the Criminal Code.\nThe matter came before Haines J. The operative part of the formal order of that learned Judge reads as follows:\nIT IS ORDERED that section 60 of the Highway Traffic Act R.S.O. 1960 is valid Provincial Legislation but in conflict with Section 221(4) of the Criminal Code of Canada, and the appeal is, therefore, allowed and the appellant\u2019s conviction for careless driving be hereby set aside.\nHaines J. at the end of his careful and elaborate reasons summarized his conclusions as follows:\n(1) The careless driving provision is valid provincial legislation in relation to the regulation of highway traffic, and thus within the competence of the provincial legislature.\n(2) The dangerous driving provision is valid federal legislation in relation to criminal law and thus within the competence of the federal parliament.\n(3) The physical conduct proscribed by the two sections is, in general substance and purpose, identical.\n(4) Mens rea is not required to convict an accused under either section.\n(5) Since both sections deal with inadvertent negligence, which does not admit of varying degrees of inattention, the mental element required to convict of either offence is the same.\nApplying the principles of constitutional law referred to earlier, it follows that the two sections cannot stand together. Parliament having \u2018occupied the field\u2019, the federal legislation must take precedence and the operation of the careless driving section is precluded by reason of the dangerous driving provisions of the Criminal Code. In considering paragraph (4) of this summary it is important to understand the sense in which the learned Judge employed the term \u201cmens rea\u201d. Earlier in his reasons he had itemized as follows three classes of conduct in the driving of an automobile in respect of which criminal liability may be imposed:\n(1) Conduct characterized by the actor\u2019s intention to bring about the result;\n(2) Conduct characterized by the actor\u2019s recklessness as to the result;\n(3) Conduct which is distinguished from acting intentionally or recklessly in that it does not involve a state of awareness.\nIn his view the existence of mens rea is an essential ingredient of an offence under items (1) and (2) but not of an offence under item (3); that is to say mens rea consists of intention or recklessness.\nPursuant to leave the Crown appealed to the Court of Appeal[2]. The appeal was allowed, the Court directed that both of the questions submitted in the stated case should be answered in the negative and that the conviction should be restored.\nPorter C.J.O. delivered the unanimous reasons of the Court of Appeal. In his opinion the provincial section differs materially from s. 221(4) of the Criminal Code in that each section defines a different offence because a person could be convicted under s. 60 without proof that his manner of driving was in fact dangerous while such proof would be essential for a conviction under s. 221(4). He also held that the two sections differed in purpose, that of s. 60 being to control the flow of traffic in a safe and orderly manner and that of s. 221 (4) being to punish dangerous driving. He concluded his reasons as follows:\nI am of the opinion that the two sections before us differed both in legislative purpose and legal and practical effect, the provincial Act imposing a duty to serve bona fide ends not otherwise secured and in no way conflicting with section 221(4) of the Criminal Code.\nThe appellant was granted leave to appeal to this Court from the judgment of the Court of Appeal. Leave to intervene in this appeal was granted to the Attorney General of Canada who supports the appeal, and to the Attorney General for Quebec and the Attorney General for Manitoba who oppose it. The decision of this Court in O\u2019Grady v. Sparling[3] dealt with s. 55(1) of the Manitoba Highway Traffic Act There is no difference in substance between the wording of that section and that of s. 60 of the Ontario Act. The reasons of the majority of the Court delivered by Judson J. make it clear that s. 60 is within the powers of the provincial Legislature. He said in part, at page 810:\nThe power of a provincial legislature to enact legislation for the regulation of highway traffic is undoubted. (Provincial Secretary of the Province of Prince Edward Island v. Egan). The legislation under attack here is part and parcel of this regulation. Rules of conduct on highways have been established by similar legislation in every province and the careless driving section is no different in character from the specific rules of the road that are laid down.\nand at page 811:\nMy conclusion is that s. 55(1) of the Manitoba Highway Traffic Act has for its true object, purpose, nature or character the regulation and control of traffic on highways and that, therefore, it is valid provincial legislation.\nIn the present appeal no counsel argues that s. 60 is ultra vires of the provincial legislature. Such an argument would be clearly untenable in view of the decision in O\u2019Grady v. Sparling. The main argument in support of the appeal is that since the enactment of s. 221(4) of the Criminal Code which came into force on September 1, 1961, that sub-section has fully occupied the field covered by s. 60 and consequently s. 60 ceases to be operative. It is argued that the basis of the judgment in O\u2019Grady v. Sparling, on this branch of the matter, was the finding that the provincial section dealt with \u201cinadvertent negligence\u201d while the relevant provisions of the Criminal Code dealt only with \u201cadvertent negligence\u201d. Stress is laid on the following paragraph of the reasons of Judson J. at page 809:\nWhat the Parliament of Canada has done is to define \u2018advertent negligence\u2019 as a crime under ss. 191(1) and 221(1). It has not touched \u2018inadvertent negligence\u2019. Inadvertent negligence is dealt with under the provincial legislation in relation to the regulation of highway traffic. That is its true character and until Parliament chooses to define it in the Criminal Code as \u2018crime\u2019, it is not crime.\nThe argument continues that by s. 221(4) Parliament has now defined \u201cinadvertent negligence\u201d as a crime.\nIn determining whether or not this is so it will be of assistance to consider the history of the legislation. The predecessor of s. 221(4) was enacted by 1938 Statutes of Canada, c. 44, s. 16 as s. 285(6) of the Criminal Code. It reads as follows:\n(6) Every one who drives a motor vehicle on a street, road, highway or other public place recklessly, or in a manner which is dangerous to the public, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the nature, condition, and use of the street, road, highway or place, and the amount of traffic which is actually at the time, or which might reasonably be expected to be, on such street, road, highway or place, shall be guilty of an offence and liable\n(a) upon indictment to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or to a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars or to both such imprisonment and fine; or\n(b) on summary conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months or to a fine not exceeding one hundred dollars or to both such imprisonment and fine.\nWhen the new Criminal Code was enacted by 2-3 Eliz. II, c. 51, the dangerous driving section was omitted.\nIn the new Code s. 191 defines criminal negligence. It reads as follows:\n191 (1) Every one is criminally negligent who\n(a) in doing anything, or\n(b) in omitting to do anything that it is his duty to do, shows wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons.\n(2) For the purposes of this section \u2018duty\u2019 means a duty imposed by law.\nSection 192 defines the offence of causing death by criminal negligence, the maximum punishment being life imprisonment. Section 193 defines the offence of causing bodily harm by criminal negligence, the maximum punishment being imprisonment for ten years.\nSubsection (1) of s. 221 is as follows:\n221(1) Every one who is criminally negligent in the operation of a motor vehicle is guilty of\n(a) an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for five years,\nor\n(b) an offence punishable on summary conviction.\nSection 221(4) was enacted by Statutes of Canada 1960-61, c. 43, s. 3, and is as follows:\n(4) Every one who drives a motor vehicle on a street, road, highway or other public place in a manner that is dangerous to the public, having regard to all the circumstances including the nature, condition and use of such place and the amount of traffic that at the time is or might reasonably be expected to be on such place, is guilty of\n(a) an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for two years, or\n(b) an offence punishable on summary conviction. It will be observed that the words \u201crecklessly or\u201d which appeared in s. 285(6) do not appear in s. 221(4) and that, subject only to that omission, the wording of the two subsections is substantially identical.\nIn my opinion, s. 285(6) created two offences of which the driver of a motor vehicle on a highway or other public place might be guilty, (i) driving recklessly and (ii) driving in a manner dangerous to the public. The first of these offences continues to exist under the new Code by the combined effect of ss. 191 and 221(1). The second of these offences was reintroduced into the criminal law by the enactment of s. 221(4), and in ascertaining the intention of Parliament as to whether that sub-section was intended to render inadvertent negligence a crime it will be of assistance to consider the view taken by the Courts in the case of charges of dangerous driving laid under s. 285(6).\nIn Loiselle v. The Queen[4], Casey J. reviewed some of the earlier decisions in the courts of other provinces and in this Court and said at page 332:\nAs I read these cases, each automobile accident presents two problems\u2014Was there any negligence?\u2014and if so, was the driver negligent to a degree over and above that which would be required to engage his civil responsibility? If the second question be answered affirmatively then it becomes necessary, having regard to the exact degree of negligence present, to decide what offence had been committed. But in all cases, and each must be treated on its own merits, it must first be found that there was negligence of sufficient gravity to lift the case out of the civil field into that of the Criminal Code. Both of the acts envisaged by s. 285(6) imply, as has been said elsewhere (Rex v. Karasick (1950) 2 W.W.R. 399, 195 Can. Abr. 184) \u2018something more than mere inadvertence or mere thoughtlessness or mere negligence or mere error of judgment\u2019. They imply a knowledge or wilful disregard of the probable consequences or a deliberate failure to take reasonable precautions. It is this extra element which I think Mr. Justice Taschereau must have had in mind when he used (American Automobile Ins. Co. v. Dickson) the words \u2018a moral quality carried into the act\u2019. Unless the record discloses some evidence from which the existence of this extra element can be inferred, the conviction cannot stand.\nIn my view this passage accurately stated the law. It negatived the suggestion that proof of mere inadvertent negligence would support a conviction on a charge of either of the crimes defined by s. 285(6). Had it been the intention of Parliament in enacting s. 221(4) to define inadvertent negligence as a crime it appears to me unlikely that it would have employed the very words which had been held, in Loiselle v. The Queen and the cases there referred to, not to accomplish that purpose. In this connection I have not overlooked s. 21(4) of The Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 158, which reads as follows:\n(4) Parliament shall not, by re-enacting any Act or enactment, or by-revising, consolidating or amending the same, be deemed to have adopted the construction that has, by judicial decision or otherwise, been placed upon the language used in such Act, or upon similar language.\nIn Studer v. Cowper[5], Kerwin J., as he then was, considered the effect of a similar sub-section and after quoting; from the judgments of the Court in Canadian Pacific Railway v. Albin[6] and Orpen v. Roberts[7], went on to hold: at page 454 that the effect of this sub-section of the Interpretation Act is that it\nmerely removes the presumption that existed at common law and, in a proper case, it will be held that a legislature did have in mind the construction that had been placed upon a certain enactment when re-enacting it.\nThis view was approved and acted upon by the majority in this Court in Canadian Acceptance Corporation Ltd. v. Fisher[8].\nThe reasoning of Casey J. in the passage from his judgment quoted above appears to me to be applicable to a charge of dangerous driving under s. 221(4) of the Criminal Code, and I am of opinion that the argument that by that sub-section Parliament has defined \u201cinadvertent negligence\u201d as a crime must be rejected.\nIn the course of the argument reference was made to a number of decisions in other jurisdictions where the Courts have reached a different conclusion in construing enactments worded similarly to s. 221(4). I do not think it, necessary to examine these decisions in detail; they are collected and discussed by Coffin J. in Regina v. Jefiers[9]. I agree with his conclusion that the principle stated in the judgment of Casey J. in Loiselle v. The Queen should be acted upon in interpreting s. 221(4). I agree also with his reasons for reaching that conclusion.\nHaving reached the conclusion that in enacting s. 221(4) Parliament has not defined \u201cinadvertent negligence\u201d as a crime, I find the present case indistinguishable from O\u2019Grady v. Sparling and would dismiss the appeal.\nSeveral other points were argued before us but, in view of the conclusion at which I have arrived on the point dealt with above, it becomes unnecessary to discuss them and I propose to follow the advice which Lord Macnaghten referred to as \u201coften quoted but not perhaps always followed\u201d and to refrain from \u201centering more largely upon an interpretation of the British North America Act than is necessary for the decision of the particular question in hand\u201d (vide A.G. of Manitoba v. Manitoba Licence Holders\u2019 Association[10] and Citizens Insurance Co. of Canada v. Parsons[11]).\nI would dismiss the appeal but would make no order as to costs.\nAbbott and Judson JJ. concurred with the judgment delivered by\nFAUTEUX J.:\u2014On May 12, 1964, the appellant was tried, by Deputy Magistrate D.F. Hamilton in the Magistrates\u2019 Court in Toronto, for driving carelessly. This offence is described in s. 60 of The Highway Traffc Act, R.S.O. 1960,c. 172:\n60. Every person is guilty of the offence of driving carelessly who drives a vehicle on a highway without due care and attention or without reasonable consideration for other persons using the highway and is liable to a fine of not less than $10 and not more than $500 or to imprisonment for a term of not more than three months, and in addition his licence or permit may be suspended for a period of not more than two years.\nIn limine litis, counsel for the accused submitted that s. 60 had become inoperative in view of subs. (4), recently added by Parliament to s. 221 of the Criminal Code. Sub-section (4) provides that:\n221.......................................................\n(4) Every one who drives a motor vehicle on a street, road, highway or other public place in a manner that is dangerous to the public, having regard to all the circumstances including the nature, condition and use of such place and the amount of traffic that at the time is or might reasonably be expected to be on such place, is guilty of\n(a) an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for two years, or\n(b) an offence punishable on summary conviction. This submission was rejected and on the evidence the accused was found guilty.\nThe appellant appealed, by way of a stated case, to the Supreme Court of Ontario. The questions of law submitted, by the Deputy Magistrate, for the opinion of the Court were:\nDid I err in law in\n(i) finding that Section 60 of The Highway Traffic Act was not ultra vires,\n(ii) finding that there was no conflict between Section 60 of The Highway Traffic Act and Section 221(4) of the Criminal Code of Canada.\nMr. Justice Haines, who heard the appeal, held that both s. 60 and s. 221(4) are valid legislation, the first as being legislation in relation to the regulation of highway traffic and, as such, within the competence of a Legislature, and the second as being legislation in relation to criminal law and, as such, within the competence of Parliament. To determine whether, as contended for by the appellant, these two sections were in collision or conflict, the learned Judge proceeded to analyse and compare, from the point of view of actus reus and of mens rea, the components of each of the two offences. With respect to actus reus, he reached the view that the use, in s. 60, of the words \u201cdue care and attention\u201d and \u201creasonable consideration for other persons using the highway\u201d contemplates a manner of driving that is dangerous to the public or that it is so similar as to be undistinguishable for practical purposes from the manner of driving prescribed by s. 221(4) of the Criminal Code. He thus found that s. 60 and s. 221(4), respectively defining the offence of driving carelessly and the offence of dangerous driving, are designed to embrace the same conduct and that under both provisions actus reus is similar. With respect to mens rea, the learned Judge relied mainly on certain statements in the judgment of this Court in O\u2019Grady v. Sparling[12], found that under neither section was mens rea a requisite to convict and hence that there was also, in this respect, similarity under both sections. The learned Judge then concluded that Parliament having occupied the field, the federal legislation must take precedence and the operation of the careless driving provision of The Highway Trafic Act is precluded by reason of the dangerous driving provision of the Criminal Code. The appeal was allowed and the conviction of the appellant for the offence of driving carelessly was set aside.\nFrom this decision respondent appealed to the Court of Appeal of Ontario[13]. By a unanimous judgment, the Court, composed of Porter C.J.O., Roach, Gibson, MacKay and Kelly JJ.A., allowed the appeal and set aside the Order of Mr. Justice Haines.\nThe appellant now appeals, with leave, to this Court. Leave to intervene was granted to the Attorney General of Canada, the Attorney General of the Province of Quebec and the Attorney General of the Province of Manitoba.\nIt cannot be disputed that the responsibility for the regulation of highway traffic, including the authority to prescribe the conditions and the manner of the use of motor vehicles on the highways, in the province, is primarily committed to local Legislatures (Provincial Secretary of the Province of P.E.I, v. Egan[14]). Nor can it be challenged that an enactment of a nature such as that of s. 60 of the Ontario Highway Traffic Act is legislation in relation to the regulation of highway traffic in the province (O\u2019Grady v. Sparling, supra). The sole issue in the present appeal stems from the fact that, since the decision of this Court in the latter case, Parliament has enacted s. 221(4); and this issue is whether, as contended for by appellant with the support of the Attorney General of Canada but contested by respondent with the concurrence of the Attorney General of the Province of Quebec and the Attorney General of the Province of Manitoba, s. 60 is in conflict, in the technical sense, with s. 221(4), with the consequence that s. 60 would now be suspended or inoperative. Rejecting as ill-founded the suggestion of conflict, Porter C.J.O., who delivered the judgment for the Court of Appeal, quoted, as also obtaining in this case, the test adopted as well as the conclusion reached by this Court in O\u2019Grady v. Sparling. This test was whether the two pieces of legislation considered in that case to wit s. 55(1) of the Highway Traffic Act, R.S.M. 1954, c. 112, which is couched in terms similar to those of s. 60 and s.221(1) of the Criminal Code which deals with the offence of criminal negligence in the operation of a motor vehicle, differed both in legislative purpose and legal and practical effect; and the conclusion reached was that the provincial enactment was imposing a duty to serve bona fide ends not otherwise secured and in no way conflicting with the federal enactment. With these views of the Court of Appeal I am in respectful agreement. Notwithstanding the able argument of Counsel for the Attorney General of Canada, I am quite unable to read, in what constitutes the essence of the ratio decidendi in the O\u2019Grady case, anything supporting the theory of conflict advanced in the present case. When a question of conflict arises with respect to the criminal law power of Parliament and the provincial regulatory power, it appears to me that one must be mindful that broadly as the criminal law power of Parliament has been construed\u2014as is illustrated by the classic statement of Lord Atkin in Proprietary Articles Trade Association v. Attorney General of Canada[15]\u2014it has never been authoritatively suggested that the construction of this power could be validly extended to a point leading to the gradual and eventual absorption or virtual extinction of the provincial regulatory power. Indeed, both these powers must be rationalized in principle and reconciled in practice whenever possible. I do not think that because the circumstances of a particular case may bring it within the scope of both s. 221 (4) and s. 60 one may validly conclude that s. 60 does not impose a duty to serve bona fide ends not otherwise secured and in no way conflicting with s. 221(4). In the present case, I see no obstacle preventing both enactments living together and operating concurrently.\nBeing of opinion that the provisions of s. 221(4) and those of s. 60 differ with respect to subject-matter as well as with respect to legislative purpose and legal and practical effect, I would dismiss the appeal but make no order as to costs.\nMartland and Judson J.J. concurred with the judgment delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014I have had the advantage of reading the Reasons for judgment of my brothers Cartwright and Spence and I agree with them that this appeal should be dismissed and that the provisions of s. 221(4) of the Criminal Code are not to be construed as creating a crime of \u201cinadvertent negligence\u201d.\nIt appears to me to be obvious that everyone who drives a motor vehicle in a manner contrary to the provisions of s. 221(4) of the Criminal Code is driving \u201cwithout due care and attention or without consideration for other persons using the highway\u201d (contrary to s. 60 of the Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 172), but I do not consider that the converse is necessarily the case.\nThe purpose and effect of s. 221(4) is to make it a criminal offence for anyone to drive to the public danger but, notwithstanding the careful argument to the contrary addressed to us on behalf of the Attorney General of Canada, I am satisfied that there is a type of careless and inconsiderate driving which falls short of being \u201cdangerous\u201d within the meaning of that section and that the purpose of s. 60 of the Highway Traffic Act is to provide appropriate sanctions for the regulation and control of such driving in the interests of the lawful users of the highways of Ontario.\nI am accordingly of the opinion that s. 60 of the Highway Traffic Act and s. 221(4) of the Criminal Code deal with different subject matters and were enacted for different purposes and that this case is therefore governed by the decision of this Court in O\u2019Grady v. Sparling[16].\nI would dispose of the appeal as proposed by my brother Cartwright.\nSPENCE J.:\u2014I have had the privilege of reading the reasons of Mr. Justice Cartwright and, with respect, I agree that the appeal should be dismissed for the reasons set out by my brother. I think it proper, however, to add certain further considerations.\nJudson J. in O\u2019Grady v. Sparling16 said:\nWhat the Parliament of Canada has done is to define \u201cadvertent negligence\u201d as a crime under ss. 191(1) and 221(1). It has not touched \u201cinadvertent negligence\u201d. Inadvertent negligence is dealt with under the provincial legislation in relation to the regulation of highway traffic. That is its true character and until Parliament chooses to define it in the Criminal Code as \u201ccrime\u201d, it is not crime. We would therefore be assisted in the solution to our problem if we were able to determine whether by the enactment of s. 221(4) of the Criminal Code Parliament has moved into the field of inadvertent negligence by the enactment of a provision which is repugnant to s. 60 of the Highway Traffic Act of the Province of Ontario and, therefore, render the latter inoperable. I accept as a standard of repugnance that adopted by Martland J. in this Court in Smith v. The Queen[17]:\nThe fact that both provisions prohibit certain acts with penal consequences does not constitute a conflict. It may happen that some acts might be punishable under both provisions and in this sense that these provisions overlap. However, even in such cases, there is no conflict in the sense that compliance with one law involves breach of the other. It would appear, therefore, that they can operate concurrently.\nSurely a practical test is to consider whether there may be cases in which the accused\u2019s conduct would justify a conviction under the provisions of s. 60 of the Highway Traffic Act of Ontario but where no conviction would be possible under the provisions of s. 221(4) of the Criminal Code.\nHaines J., in giving judgment upon the application to quash in the present case, said:\nIt is true that the careless driving section makes no express reference to creating an element of danger to the safety of members of the public. However, the use of the words \u201cdue care and attention and reasonable consideration for other persons using the highway\u201d clearly contemplates a manner of driving that is dangerous to the public or that is so similar as to be indistinguishable for practical purposes from the manner of driving prescribed by the corresponding section of the Criminal Code.\nWith respect, I am unable to agree with that statement. It is true that in many cases upon the prosecution for a breach of s. 60 of the Highway Traffic Act of Ontario the; Crown may be able to demonstrate that the driving of the accused either created a danger or at any rate was in. circumstances where danger was probable. In my view, however, that danger was not a necessary ingredient of the offence charged under s. 60 of the Highway Traffic Act of Ontario.\nJudson J. in O\u2019Grady v. Sparling, supra, said at p. 810:\nThe power of a provincial legislature to enact legislation for the; regulation of highway traffic is undoubted. (Provincial Secretary of the Province of Prince Edward Island v. Egan, 1941 S.C.R. 396). The legislation under attack here is part and parcel of this regulation. Rules of conduct on highways have been established by similar legislation in every province and the careless driving section is no different in character from the specific rules of the road that are laid down.\nLeBel J.A., in giving one of the judgments for the Court of Appeal of Ontario in Regina v. Yolles[18], said at p. 228:\nIn the absence of such a compendious rule, (the present s. 60 of the Highway Traffic Act) the Province could not exercise effective control of traffic on its highways in the general interest of the safety; it would be quite impossible to do so in my opinion, and I think it is equally impossible to expect the Province to enact specific rules of the road to cover all contingencies that might call for the exercise of caution.\nThe history of motor vehicle legislation over the past decades has shown the inclusion in the statute of an ever-increasing number of statutory \u201cRules of the Road\u201d. The present Highway Traffic Act of Ontario, R.S.O. 1960, c. 172, has a Part devoted to such Rules which commences at s. 62A and proceeds through to s. 100. Many of those sections have a considerable number of subsections.\nAs said by LeBel J.A., it is \u201cimpossible to expect the province to enact specific rules of the road to cover all contingencies\u201d.\nThere are many situations where the action of a driver might endanger no other person upon the highway or where there may be no probable situation of danger but there could be inconvenience to other users of the highway, obstruction of the free use of the highway, or other interference with the rights of other users of the highway. In my view, the person guilty of that kind of conduct would be, to use the words of s. 60 of the Highway Traffic Act of Ontario, \u201cdriving without due care and attention or without reasonable consideration for other persons using the highway\u201d. Under such circumstances, there could be a conviction for breach of the provisions of s. 60 of the Highway Traffic Act of Ontario. However, no conviction for a breach of s. 221(4) of the Criminal Code could have resulted as the driving was not \u201cin a manner dangerous to the public\u201d.\nWith respect, I adopt the words of Porter C.J.O. in giving the judgment in the Court of Appeal in the present case when he said: To succeed in a prosecution under the section it would be sufficient to prove that the accused was driving in a manner which would answer either one of these descriptions. And this would suffice whether or not the manner of driving were also dangerous. The accused would be liable to conviction whether the driving were dangerous or not. The section contemplates, not only that the highways should be made safe, but that travellers on the highways should conduct themselves in a civilized and considerate manner toward their fellow travellers. Thus the Provincial section differs materially from the section of the Code. Each section defines a different offence.\nIt is also worthy of note that s. 60 of the Highway Traffic Act of Ontario is by its terms confined to the highway which is restrictively defined in s. 1(1), para. 10, of the Highway Traffic Act while s. 221(4) of the Criminal Code applies, inter alia, to \u201ca public place\u201d which may be much broader than any area included in the definition in the Highway Traffic Act.\nIt follows, therefore, that although there may be overlapping the consequence is not repugnance. The two sections dead with different subjects and therefore they may stand together. Section 221(4) of the Criminal Code has not made inoperable s. 60 of the Highway Traffic Act.\nAppeal dismissed; no order as to costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Weingust & Halman, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the Attorney General of Canada: E.A.

The appellant was convicted on a charge of careless driving, contrary to s. 60 of the Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 172. The evidence established that he drove his motor vehicle into the rear portion of a vehicle parked on the shoulder of the highway off the pavement. On appeal by way of a stated case, his conviction was affirmed and a further appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed. He was granted leave to appeal to this Court on the following grounds: (1) Did the Court of Appeal err in holding that there was a prima facie case of careless driving; and (2) Did the Court of Appeal err in finding that s. 60 of the Highway Traffic Act was not in conflict with s. 221(4) of the Criminal Code? The first ground of appeal was rejected by this Court without written reasons at the conclusion of the argument of counsel for the appellant on that ground, and judgment was reserved on the second ground of appeal.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe second ground of appeal was the same as that dealt with by this Court in Mann v. The Queen (ante p. 238) and should be rejected for the reasons given therein.\nDroit constitutionnel\u2014Droit criminel\u2014Offense provinciale de conduite n\u00e9gligente d\u2019automobile\u2014Collision avec un v\u00e9hicule stationnaire\u2014Y a-t-il conflit avec l\u2019offense de conduite dangereuse telle que d\u00e9finie par le Code criminel\u2014Highway Traffic Act, S.R.O. 1960, c. 172, art. 60\u2014Code criminel, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, art. 221(4).\nL\u2019appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9 coupable sous un chef d\u2019accusation d\u2019avoir conduit une automobile de fa\u00e7on n\u00e9gligente, contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019art. 60 du Highway Traffic Act, S.R.O. 1960, c. 172.

Sur appel en vertu d\u2019un dossier soumis, le verdict de culpabilit\u00e9 fut confirm\u00e9 et un appel subs\u00e9quent \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019Appel fut rejet\u00e9. Il a obtenu permission d\u2019appeler devant cette Cour sur les motifs suivants: (1) La Cour d\u2019Appel a-t-elle err\u00e9 en adjugeant qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un cas prima facie de conduite n\u00e9gligente; et (2) La Cour d\u2019Appel a-t-elle err\u00e9 en adjugeant que l\u2019art. 60 du Highway Traffic Act n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en conflit avec l\u2019art. 221(4) du Code Criminel? A la fin de la plaidoirie de l\u2019avocat de l\u2019appelant sur le premier motif d\u2019appel, ce motif fut rejet\u00e9 par la Cour sans notes \u00e9crites, et le jugement sur le second motif d\u2019appel fut pris en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9.\nLe second motif d\u2019appel \u00e9tait semblable \u00e0 celui qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 par cette Cour dans la cause de Mann v.

MacDonald, Q.C., and Jon van der Woerd, for the Attorney General of Canada.\nR.A. Cormack, Q.C., and C.M. Powell, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Cartwright and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014The appellant was convicted by a magistrate on February 19, 1964, on the charge of driving a motor vehicle on a highway carelessly contrary to s. 60 of theHighway Traffic Act of Ontario.\nOn appeal by way of a stated case his conviction was affirmed by McRuer C.J.H.C. and an appeal from the order of McRuer C.J.H.C. was dismissed by the Court of Appeal for Ontarion.\nPursuant to leave granted by this Court the appellant appeals from the judgment of the Court of Appeal on the following grounds:\n(1) The Court of Appeal for Ontario erred in holding that there was a prima facie case of careless driving made out by the Crown at the trial in the first instance before the Magistrate;\n(2) The Court of Appeal for Ontario erred in finding that Section 60 of the Highway Traffic Act of Ontario, R.S.O. 1960, Chapter 172, was not in conflict with Section 221(4) of the Criminal Code of Canada.\nIt will be observed that the second of these grounds is the same as that dealt with in the case of Mann v. The Queen, ante p. 238, in which judgment is being delivered at the same time as the judgment in the case at bar. On this ground all counsel relied on the arguments addressed to us in the Mann appeal and did not repeat them.\nAt the conclusion of the argument of counsel for the appellant dealing with the first ground of appeal the Court were unanimously of opinion that that ground must be rejected and counsel for the respondent were not called upon in regard to it. Judgment was reserved to enable the Court to consider the second ground.\nFor the reasons which I have given in the case of Mann v. The Queen, I am of opinion that the second ground of appeal must be rejected. I would dismiss the appeal but would make no order as to costs.\nAbbott and Judson JJ. concurred with the judgment delivered by\nFAUTEUX J.:\u2014The only issue remaining for consideration at the close of the hearing of this appeal being identical to the one raised in the case of Mann v. The Queen, I would, for the reasons I gave in that case, dismiss the appeal but make no order as to costs.\nMartland and Judson JJ. concurred with the judgment delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014For the reasons which I have given in the case of Mann v. The Queen I would dispose of this appeal in the manner proposed by my brother Cartwright.\nAppeal dismissed, no order as to costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: O\u2019Driscoll, Kelly & McRae, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the Attorney General of Canada: E.A.

Cormack, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nThe CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014In this case, the appellant, who is in custody, completed a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario on Form B prescribed in the Rules respecting Criminal Proceedings which came into force in Ontario on March 1, 1965.

The appellant was not present and no counsel had been assigned to present the appeal.\nSome time in May the appellant was informed by the Governor of the jail that his appeal had been dismissed. By letter of May 28, 1965, from the Registrar of the Court of Appeal, he was sent a copy of the order of the Court of Appeal made on May 7, 1965. By letter dated June 24, 1965, from the Registrar, he was advised that his request to have his appeal argued through counsel to be assigned by the Court had been refused.\nIt is obvious that the appellant having completed his notice of appeal in the manner set out above would assume until he was advised to the contrary that counsel would be assigned to present his appeal. The failure to notify the appellant that no counsel was appointed by the Court and the failure to notify him of the date of the hearing of the appeal and to give him an opportunity to present his case either in writing or in person is fatal to the validity of the order of the Court of Appeal.\nThe Appeal is allowed, the order of the Court of Appeal of May 7, 1965, is set aside and it is directed that the record be returned to that Court to hear and determine the application of the appellant in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Code.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Gowling, MacTavish, Osborne & Henderson, Ottawa.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W.C.

Randolph, [1966] S.C.R. 260\nDate: 1966-01-25\nHer Majesty The Queen Appellant;\nand\nBernard RAndolph and World Wide Mail Services Corporation Respondents.\n1965: December 9; 1966: January 25.\nPresent: Cartwright, Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nCrown\u2014Petition of right\u2014Interim order suspending postal service\u2014Whether party affected entitled to be heard before order made\u2014Post Office Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 212, ss. 7, 40\u2014Crown Liability Act, 1952\u201453 (Can.), c. 30\u2014Canadian Bill of Rights, 1960 (Can.), c. 44, s. 2(e).\nOn April 22, 1965, the postal service of the corporate respondent, whose business consisted in sending by mail, on behalf of its customers, merchandise, documents, correspondence and other things that they asked it so to send, was temporarily suspended by the Post Office Department for the purpose of an investigation. Samples of the material which the other respondent offered for sale by means of the facilities of the corporate respondent were submitted to the Department for inspection. On April 28, 1965, the postal service of both respondents was suspended by interim orders signed by the Acting Postmaster General, pursuant to s. 7 of the Post Office Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 212. These orders were made without the respondents having been previously heard and without having had any opportunity to object or present a defence. The Exchequer Court granted the respondents' petition of right and declared that the interim orders were invalid. The Crown appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nThe two interim prohibitory orders were validly made. Section 7 of the Post Office Act authorizes the making of an interim prohibitory order without prior notice to the party affected. It would be inconsistent with the terms of the section to hold that before making an interim order the Postmaster General must hold a hearing. If such were the case, the hearing prescribed by s. 7(2) would be an unnecessary repetition. The maxim audi alteram partem has reference to the making of decisions affecting the rights of parties which are final in their nature, and this is true also of s. 2(e) of the Canadian Bill of Rights, 1960 (Can.), c. 44. Section 7(1) enables the Postmaster General to act swiftly in performing the duty of protecting the public, while s. 7(2) gives protection to the person affected by conferring the right to a hearing before any order made against him becomes final.\nThe corporate respondent was not entitled to have the mail detained during the six-day period, before the interim order was made, delivered to it. Once the order was made, to deliver the mail accumulated during that period would have been to disobey the order.\nAny claim for damages for the detention of the corporate respondent's mail during that six-day period was precluded by the terms of s. 40 of the Post Office Act, a special statutory provision which would constitute an exception to the general terms of the Crown Liability Act, 1952-53 (Can.), c. 30.\nCouronne\u2014P\u00e9tition de droit\u2014Ordre provisoire suspendant le service postal\u2014La personne concern\u00e9e a-t-elle le droit d'\u00eatre entendue avant que l'ordre soit \u00e9mis\u2014Loi sur les Postes, S.R.C. 1952, c. 212, arts. 7, 40\u2014Loi sur la Responsabilit\u00e9 de la Couronne, 1952-1953 (Can.), c. 30\u2014Loi sur la D\u00e9claration canadienne des droits, 1960 (Can.), c. 44, art. 2(e).\nLe 22 avril 1965, le service postal de la corporation intim\u00e9e, dont le commerce consistait \u00e0 envoyer par la poste, au nom de ses clients, toutes les marchandises, documents, correspondance et autres effets que ces derniers lui demandaient d'adresser ainsi, a \u00e9t\u00e9 temporairement suspendu par le Minist\u00e8re des Postes pour fins d'enqu\u00eate. Des \u00e9chantillons du mat\u00e9riel que l'autre intim\u00e9 offrait en vente par l'entremise de la corporation intim\u00e9e ont \u00e9t\u00e9 remis au Minist\u00e8re pour \u00eatre soumis \u00e0 un examen. Le 28 avril 1965, sous l'autorit\u00e9 de l'art. 7 de la Loi sur les Postes, S.R.C. 1952, c. 212, le service postal des deux intim\u00e9s a \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendu par un ordre provisoire sign\u00e9 par le Ministre agissant comme Ministre des Postes. Ces ordres ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rendus sans que les intim\u00e9s aient \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9alablement entendus et sans qu'ils aient eu l'opportunit\u00e9 de s'y objecter ou de pr\u00e9senter une d\u00e9fense. La Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier a accord\u00e9 la p\u00e9tition de droit des intim\u00e9s et a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les ordres provisoires \u00e9taient invalides. La Couronne en appela devant cette Cour.\nArr\u00eat: L'appel doit \u00eatre maintenu.\nLes deux ordres prohibitifs provisoires ont \u00e9t\u00e9 validement \u00e9mis. L'article 7 de la Loi sur les Postes autorise l'\u00e9mission d'un ordre prohibitif provisoire sans avis pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 la personne concern\u00e9e. Ce ne serait pas consistant avec les termes de l'article que de dire que le Ministre des Postes doit tenir une audience avant d'\u00e9mettre un ordre provisoire. Si tel \u00e9tait le cas, l'audience prescrite par l'art. 7(2) serait une r\u00e9p\u00e9tition non n\u00e9cessaire. La maxime audi alteram partem r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 l'\u00e9mission de d\u00e9cisions affectant les droits des parties et qui de leur nature sont d\u00e9finitives, et ceci est vrai aussi pour ce qui concerne l'art. 2(e) de la Loi sur la D\u00e9claration canadienne des droits, 1960 (Can.), c. 44. L'article 7(1) permet au Ministre des Postes d'agir rapidement dans l'ex\u00e9cution de son devoir de prot\u00e9ger le public, alors que l'art. 7(2) prot\u00e8ge la personne concern\u00e9e en lui conf\u00e9rant le droit \u00e0 une audition avant que tout ordre \u00e9mis contre elle devienne d\u00e9finitif.\nLa corporation intim\u00e9e n'avait pas droit \u00e0 la livraison du courrier qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 retenu durant la p\u00e9riode de six jours qui s'est \u00e9coul\u00e9e avant que l'ordre provisoire soit \u00e9mis. Une fois que l'ordre a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mis, la livraison du courrier accumul\u00e9 durant cette p\u00e9riode serait une d\u00e9sob\u00e9issance \u00e0 l'ordre.\nEn vertu des termes de l'art. 40 de la Loi sur les Postes, une disposition statutaire sp\u00e9ciale constituant une exception aux termes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux de la Loi sur la Responsabilit\u00e9 de la Couronne, 1952-1953 (Can.), c. 30, aucune r\u00e9clamation pour dommages r\u00e9sultant de la r\u00e9tention du courrier de la corporation intim\u00e9e durant cette p\u00e9riode de six jours ne peut \u00eatre entretenue. APPEL de la Couronne d'un jugement du Pr\u00e9sident Jackett de la Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier du Canada, accordant une p\u00e9tition de droit. Appel maintenu.\nAPPEAL by the Crown from a judgment of Jackett P. of the Exchequer Court of Canada, granting a petition of right. Appeal allowed.\nPaul Ollivier, Q.C., for the appellant.\nJean-Paul Ste-Marie, Q.C., and Conrad Shatner, for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the President of the Exchequer Court declaring the respondent Randolph entitled to have delivered to him the mail not delivered to him in due course of mail during the period from April 28, 1965, to the filing of the Petition of Right, making a similar declaration in favour of the other respondent covering the period from April 22, 1965 to the filing of the Petition, and declaring each respondent entitled to be paid damages in respect of the detention of the aforesaid mail and directing a reference to assess the damages.\nNo oral testimony was given at the trial. From the pleadings and statements made by counsel the learned President found the facts, so far as relevant, to be as follows.\n1. The suppliant Randolph does business in the city and district of Montreal and elsewhere under the registered firm name of 'Al Brino Services Reg'd.'\n2. The corporate suppliant does business in the city and district of Montreal and elsewhere.\n3. Randolph's business consists in offering to sell and selling films, books, photographs and similar objects.\n4. The corporate suppliant's business consists in sending by mail, on behalf of its customers, merchandise, documents, correspondence and other things that they ask it so to send.\n5. On Thursday, April 22, 1965, officers of the Post Office Department in Montreal suspended temporarily the postal service of the corporate suppliant for the purpose of an investigation.\n6. On Friday, April 23, 1965, the suppliant Randolph, at the request of officers of the Department, agreed to submit to them samples of films, books and photographs that he offered for sale by means of the facilities of the corporate suppliant. These samples were immediately sent to higher officers of the Department in Ottawa with a view to determining whether there were grounds, on the basis of such samples, for recommending to the Postmaster General that he exercise, in respect of the suppliants, the powers conferred upon him by section 7 of the Post Office Act, R.S.C. 1952, chapter 212. In the meantime, the corporate suppliant's postal services remained suspended by authority of the Deputy Postmaster General.\n7. On Monday, April 26, 1965, the aforesaid samples were seen and examined by the Deputy Postmaster General and two other officers of the Post Office Department.\n8. On Wednesday, April 28, 1965, the Deputy Postmaster General wrote a memorandum to the Postmaster General recommending that an interim prohibitory order be made against the suppliants under section 7 of the Post Office Act and, on the same day, the Acting Postmaster General signed two documents purporting to be interim orders under that section prohibiting the delivery of mail directed to them or deposited by them in the Post Office. These orders were made without the suppliants having been previously heard and without the suppliants having had any opportunity of objecting thereto or presenting evidence.\n9. The mail to which these orders relate, and mail that was not delivered as a result of the action taken by the Montreal Post Office officials on April 22, is detained by officers of the Post Office Department in a safe place.\nSection 7 of the Post Office Act is as follows:\n7. (1) Whenever the Postmaster General believes on reasonable grounds that any person\n(a) is, by means of the mails,\n(i) committing or attempting to commit an offence, or\n(ii) aiding, counselling or procuring any person to commit an offence, or\n(b) with intent to commit an offence, is using the mails for the purpose of accomplishing his object,\nthe Postmaster General may make an interim order (in this section called an 'interim prohibitory order') prohibiting the delivery of all mail directed to that person (in this section called the 'person affected') or deposited by that person in a post office.\n(2) Within five days after the making of an interim prohibitory order the Postmaster General shall send to the person affected a registered letter at his last known address informing him of the order and the reasons therefor and notifying him that he may within ten days of the date the registered letter was sent, or such longer period as the Postmaster General may specify in the letter, request that the order be inquired into, and upon receipt within the said ten days or longer period of a written request by the person affected that the order be inquired into, the Postmaster General shall refer the matter, together with the material and evidence considered by him in making the order, to a Board of Review consisting of three persons nominated by the Postmaster General one of whom shall be a member of the legal profession.\n(3) The Board of Review shall inquire into the facts and circumstances surrounding the interim prohibitory order and shall give the person affected a reasonable opportunity of appearing before the Board of Review, making representation to the Board and presenting evidence. (4) The Board of Review has all the powers of a commissioner under Part I of the Inquiries Act, and, in addition to the material and evidence referred to the Board by the Postmaster General, may consider such further evidence, oral or written, as it deems advisable.\n(5) Any mail detained by the Postmaster General pursuant to subsection (8) may be delivered to the Board of Review, and, with the consent of the person affected, may be opened and examined by the Board.\n(6) The Board of Review shall, after considering the matter referred to it, submit a report with its recommendation to the Postmaster General, together with all evidence and other material that was before the Board and upon receipt of the report of the Board, the Postmaster General shall reconsider the interim prohibitory order and he may revoke it or declare it to be a final prohibitory order, as he sees fit.\n(7) The Postmaster General may revoke an interim or final prohibitory order when he is satisfied that the person affected will not use the mails for any of the purposes described in subsection (1), and the Postmaster General may require an undertaking to that effect from the person affected before revoking the order.\n(8) Upon the making of an interim or final prohibitory order and until it is revoked by the Postmaster General,\n(a) no postal employee shall without the permission of the Post master General\n(i) deliver any mail directed to the person affected, or\n(ii) accept any mailable matter offered by the person affected for transmission by post,\n(b) the Postmaster General may detain or return to the sender any mail directed to the person affected and anything deposited at a post office by the person affected, and\n(c) the Postmaster General may declare any mail detained pursuant to paragraph (b) to be undeliverable mail, and any mail so declared to be undeliverable mail shall be dealt with under the regulations relating thereto.\n(9) Where no request that an interim prohibitory order be inquired into is received by the Postmaster General within the period mentioned in subsection (2), the order shall, at the expiration of the said period, be deemed to be a final prohibitory order.\nThe interim prohibitory order made in respect of the respondent World Wide Mail Services Corporation reads as follows:\nIN THE MATTER OF SECTION 7 OF THE POST OFFICE ACT INTERIM PROHIBITORY ORDER\nWhereas I have reasonable grounds to believe and do believe that the Company hereinafter named is by means of the mails, committing or attempting to commit offences, namely offences under Section 323 of the Criminal Code and offences under Section 324 of the Criminal Code.\nI, therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me under the provisions of Section 7 of the Post Office Act, prohibit the delivery of all mail directed to World Wide Mail Service Corp. 265 Craig Street West, Room 205, Montreal, Quebec, or directed to it by any other name at any other address, or deposited by the said World Wide Mail Service Corp. in a Post Office.\nThe particulars of the said offences are as follows:\nSection 323 Criminal Code-by deceit, falsehood and other fraudulent means, defrauding or attempting to defraud the public of money by misrepresenting the character of motion picture films, books and photographs offered for sale.\nSection 324 Criminal Code\u2014making use of the mails for the purpose of transmitting circulars devised and intended to deceive or defraud the public or obtain money under false pretences by misrepresenting the character of motion picture films, books and photographs offered for sale.\nDated at Ottawa, Ontario, this 28th day of April, 1965.\n(Sgd.) J. R. Nicholson\nActing Postmaster General.\nThe interim prohibitory order made in respect of the respondent Randolph is similarly worded and bears the same date.\nOn April 30, 1965, a registered letter was sent to each of the respondents in compliance with the provisions of subs. (2) of s. 7. It is said in the Statement of Defence that the respondents requested that the interim prohibitory orders be inquired into and that the Postmaster General referred the matter to a Board of Review but that the Board has not proceeded with the inquiry pending the disposition of the Petition of Right.\nThe learned President was of opinion that, while his action is primarily the exercise of an administrative and executive authority, the Postmaster General when deciding whether or not to issue an interim prohibitory order is under a duty to act judicially so that the maxim audi alteram partem is applicable and his failure to give the respondents an opportunity to be heard before issuing the interim orders was fatal to their validity.\nI do not find it necessary to decide the exact nature of the authority which the Postmaster General was exercising because it appears to me that on its true construction s. 7 of the Post Office Act authorizes the making of an interim prohibitory order without prior notice to the party affected. There is no doubt that Parliament has the power to abrogate or modify the application of the maxim audi alteram partem. In s. 7 it has not abrogated it. Rather it has provided that before any final prohibitory order is made, the party affected shall have notice and a right to an expeditious hearing and has defined the procedure to be followed. It would, in my opinion, be inconsistent with the scheme of the section to hold that before making an interim order the Postmaster General must hold a hearing. If such a duty existed it would be a duty to notify the party affected of what was alleged against him and to give him a reasonable opportunity to answer. If this were done the hearing prescribed by subs. (2) would be an unnecessary repetition. Generally speaking the maxim audi alteram partem has reference to the making of decisions affecting the rights of parties which are final in their nature, and this is true also of s. 2 (e) of the Canadian Bill of Rights upon which the respondents relied.\nThe following passage in Broom's Legal Maxims, 10th ed., at p. 117 is in point:\nAlthough cases may be found in the books of decisions under particular statutes which at first might seem to conflict with the maxim, it will be found on consideration that they are not inconsistent with it, for the rule, which is one of elementary justice, only requires that a man shall not be subject to final judgment or to punishment without an opportunity of being heard.\nThe main object of s. 7 is to enable the Postmaster General to take prompt action to prevent the use of the mails for the purpose of defrauding the public or other criminal activity. That purpose might well be defeated if he could take action only after notice and a hearing. Sub-section (1) enables him to act swiftly in performing the duty of protecting the public while subs. (2) gives protection to the person affected by conferring the right to a hearing before any order made against him becomes final.\nIn my opinion, the two interim prohibitory orders in question were validly made.\nTwo subsidiary questions remain. The first is as follows. The mail of the corporate respondent was admittedly detained during the period from April 22, 1965, to April 28, 1965. The learned President was of opinion that even if the orders made on April 28, 1965, were valid the corporate respondent was entitled to have the mail detained during that period delivered to it. I am unable to agree with this view. The order of April 28, 1965, in regard to the corporate respondent has already been quoted. By its terms the delivery of all mail addressed to that respondent was prohibited. Its operation was not restricted to mail posted on or after the day of the making of the order. Once the order was made, to deliver the mail accumulated during the period mentioned would have been to disobey the order.\nThe second subsidiary question is whether the corporate respondent is entitled to damages for the detention of its mail during the six day period. The claim for such damages is against Her Majesty and would seem to be precluded by the terms of s. 40 of the Post Office Act which reads as follows:\n40. Neither Her Majesty nor the Postmaster General is liable to any person for any claim arising from the loss, delay or mishandling of anything deposited in a post office, except as provided in this Act or the regulations.\nThis is a special statutory provision which would constitute an exception to the general terms of the Crown Liability Act. For this reason I am of opinion that this claim for damages cannot be sustained.\nI would allow the appeal with costs, set aside the judgment of the Exchequer Court and direct that judgment be entered dismissing the Petition of Right with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: E. A. Driedger, Ottawa.\nSolicitor for the respondents: J. P. Ste.-Marie, Montreal.\n"}

They were to be used for food and were not to be sold. He was acquitted at trial on a charge of unlawfully hunting laid pursuant to s. 12(1) of the Migratory Birds Convention Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 179, on the ground that the Act did not apply to him. On appeal by the Crown to the Supreme Court of Ontario, the dismissal of the charge was affirmed and a further appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed by a majority judgment. The Crown was granted leave to appeal to this Court.\nHeld (Cartwright J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and a verdict of guilty should be entered.\nPer Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Hall JJ.: The object and intent of s. 87 of the Indian Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 149, is to make Indians, who are under the exclusive legislative jurisdiction of Parliament by virtue of s. 91(24) of the B.N.A. Act, 1867, subject to provincial laws of general application.\nSection 87 was not intended to be a declaration of the paramountcy of treaties over federal legislation. The reference to treaties was incorporated in a section the purpose of which was to make provincial laws applicable to Indians, so as to preclude any interference with rights under treaties resulting from the impact of provincial legislation. The provisions of s. 87 do not prevent the application to Indians of the Migratory Birds Convention Act. There was no valid distinction between the present case and that of Sikyea v. The Queen, [1964] S.C.R. 642, which should be followed.\nPer Cartwright J., dissenting: The Treaty of 1827 was a treaty within the meaning of that word as used in s. 87 of the Indian Act. That Treaty assured to the Indians the right to hunt and fish on the Reserve. That right has not been effectively destroyed by the Migratory Birds Convention Act and the Migratory Birds Regulations so far as wild ducks are concerned. The Migratory Birds Convention Act is a law of general application in force in Ontario and applicable to the respondent, but by s. 87 its application to him is made subject to the terms of the Treaty of 1827. Section 87 of the Indian Act shows that Parliament was careful to preserve the rights solemnly assured to the Indians by the Treaty of 1827. Section 87 makes the Indians subject to the laws of general application in force in the province in which they reside but at the same time it preserves inviolate to the Indians whatever rights they have under the terms of any treaty so that in a case of conflict between the provisions of the laws and the terms of the treaty the latter shall prevail. The question as to whether the right assured by the Treaty of 1827 has been destroyed by the Migratory Birds Convention Act has not been decided in favour of the Crown by the decision of this Court in Sikyea v. The Queen, supra.\nDroit criminel\u2014Indiens\u2014Chasse pour nourriture dans la R\u00e9serve en temps prohib\u00e9\u2014Droits en vertu des Trait\u00e9s\u2014Sont-ils exempts des dispositions de la Loi sur la Convention concernant les oiseaux migrateurs, S.R.C. 1952, c. 179\u2014Loi sur les Indiens, S.R.C. 1952, c.149, art. 87.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9, un Indien, tira et tua deux canards sauvages migrateurs dans une R\u00e9serve alors que la chasse de ces oiseaux \u00e9tait prohib\u00e9e.

Appel maintenu, le Juge Cartwright \u00e9tant dissident.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1, dismissing an appeal by the Crown. Appeal allowed, Cartwright J. dissenting. D.H. Christie, Q.C., for the appellant.\nB.J. MacKinnon, Q.C., and Hugh D. Garrett, Q.C., for the respondent.\nCARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):\u2014This appeal is brought, pursuant to leave granted by this Court, from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1 dismissing an appeal from an order of McRuer C.J.H.C. which dismissed an appeal from an order of Magistrate Dunlap acquitting the respondent on a charge that he did on the 5th day of September 1962, at Kettle Point Indian Reserve unlawfully hunt a migratory bird at a time not during the open season specified for that bird in violation of s. 5(1) (a) of the Migratory Bird Regulations thereby committing an offence contrary to s. 12(1) of the Migratory Birds Convention Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 179. Gibson J.A., dissenting, would have allowed the appeal.\nThere is no dispute as to the facts. The respondent is an Indian within the meaning of the Indian Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 149. He is a member of the Chippewa Band residing on the Kettle Point Reserve. On the date stated in the charge he shot two ducks, which were migratory birds, as defined in the Migratory Birds Convention Act and the Regulations made thereunder, in an area described in Schedule A of the Regulations at a time not during the open season for such birds. The ducks were to be used for food and were not to be sold.\nOn these facts it would appear that the respondent was guilty of the offence charged unless, because he is an Indian and shot the ducks for food on the reserve on which he resided, he is exempt from the provisions of the Migratory Birds Convention Act and Migratory Bird Regulations under which he was charged.\nThe learned Magistrate was of opinion that s. 87 of the Indian Act made laws of general application applicable to Indians, subject to the terms of any treaty, that the Migratory Birds Convention Act was such a law, that the treaty of July 10, 1827, with the Chippewa Indians to be referred to hereafter reserved to them the right to hunt at any time on the lands reserved in that treaty and, conse- quently, that the Migratory Birds Convention Act did not apply to the respondent.\nMcRuer C.J.H.C. agreed with the view of the learned Magistrate and was further of opinion that the right of the respondent to hunt for food on Kettle Point Reserve was preserved not only by the treaty of 1827 but also by the proclamation of 1763 and that if it is within the power of Parliament to abrogate that right, a point which the learned Chief Justice left open, that power could be exercised only by legislation expressly and directly extinguishing the right and that it certainly could not be extinguished by order-in-council.\nAfter discussing the case of Dominion of Canada v. Province of Ontario[2], the learned Chief Justice said:\nThis case clearly recognizes that the \u2018overlying Indian interest\u2019 in the lands reserved to the Indians is not something to be disposed of by any general Act of Parliament applicable to all citizens.\nHe also said:\nI wish to make it quite clear that I am not called upon to decide, nor do I decide, whether the Parliament of Canada by legislation specifically applicable to Indians could take away their rights to hunt for food on the Kettle Point Reserve. There is much to support an argument that Parliament does not have such power. There may be cases where such legislation, properly framed, might be considered necessary in the public interest but a very strong case would have to be made out that would not be a breach of our national honour.\nThe judgment of the majority in the Court of Appeal was delivered by Roach J.A., with whom McLennan J.A. agreed. The learned Justice of Appeal construed the treaty of 1827, in the light of its historical background including the terms of the Proclamation of 1763, as preserving and confirming to the Indians their right to the use of the lands reserved including those in the Kettle Point Reserve as their \u201cHunting Grounds\u201d. He held that the Migratory Birds Convention Act is a law of general application in force in the Province within the meaning of s. 87 of the Indian Act so that its application to the respondent is subject to the terms of the treaty. The reasons of Roach J.A. conclude as follows:\nThe treaty does not refer to the Proclamation in terms but historical implication impels the conclusion that what was surrendered and conveyed to the Crown by the treaty were the rights granted to them by the Proclamation to and in respect of the lands described in the treaty as being intended to be thereby conveyed. What was preserved and confirmed to them were those same rights to and in respect of the lands reserved by the treaty and without any time limitation thereon.\nSince the Migratory Birds Convention Act is subject to the treaty and since the treaty preserved and confirmed to the Indians the use of lands, including those in the Kettle Point Reserve, as their \u2018Hunting Grounds\u2019, giving to those words their wide historical significance, it follows that an Indian while hunting on those lands for food is not subject to the restrictions or prohibitions contained in that Act or the regulations.\nThe essential difference of opinion between Gibson J.A. and the majority was as to the construction of the treaty of 1827. As to this, after quoting s. 87 of the Indian Act, Gibson J.A. says:\nOn behalf of the accused it is argued that the Treaty of 1827 reserved to the Indians the land of the reserve for their \u2018exclusive use and enjoyment\u2019, and that by implication that included the perpetual right to fish and hunt on the lands. As I have stated before, nothing contained in the Treaty indicates that questions of hunting and fishing were ever dealt with or considered when the Treaty was entered into.\nWith the greatest respect to Gibson J.A. I am unable to accept this view. For the reasons given by Roach J.A. I agree with his interpretation of the terms of the treaty. I find it impossible to suppose that any of the signatories to the treaty would have understood that what was reserved to the Indians and their posterity was the right merely to occupy the reserved lands and not the right to hunt and fish thereon which they had enjoyed from time immemorial.\nThe question to be decided is whether the right to hunt on the reserve assured by the treaty to the band of which the respondent is a member has been effectively destroyed by the Migratory Birds Convention Act and the Migratory Bird Regulations so far as wild ducks are concerned.\nCounsel for the appellants submits that this question should be answered in the affirmative on three main grounds, (i) that the point has been decided in favour of the appellant by the decision of this Court in Sikyea v. The Queen[3], (ii) that the words \u201claws of general application from time to time in force in any province\u201d in s. 87 of the Indian Act mean provincial laws and not federal laws and (iii) that the treaty of July 10, 1827, did not reserve to the Indians the right to hunt and fish on the reserve. I will deal with these three grounds in reverse order. As to the third ground, counsel for the appellant concedes that the document of July 10, 1827, is a treaty within the meaning of that word as used in s. 87 of the Indian Act. I think he was clearly right in making this concession. In my opinion it is the very sort of treaty contemplated by the section. On the question of the true construction of the treaty I have already indicated my agreement with the reasons and conclusion of Roach J.A. on this branch of the matter. It follows that I would reject this ground of appeal.\nAs to the second ground, s. 87 of the Indian Act reads as follows:\n87. Subject to the terms of any treaty and any other Act of Parliament of Canada, all laws of general application from time to time in force in any province are applicable to and in respect of Indians in the province, except to the extent that such laws are inconsistent with this Act or any order, rule, regulation or by-law made thereunder, and except to the extent that such laws make provision for any matter for which provision is made by or under this Act.\nThe laws of general application in force in the Province of Ontario are made up of the common law, pre-confederation statutes which have not been repealed, Acts of Parliament and Acts of the Legislature. I can find nothing in the words of the section to permit the meaning of the phrase \u201claws of general application from time to time in force in any province\u201d being restricted to provincial statutes or to laws in relation to matters coming within the classes of subjects assigned to the Legislature by s. 92 of the British North America Act. To determine whether any particular law is applicable to an Indian in Ontario only two questions need be answered, (i) is it a law of general application? and (ii) is it in force in the Province? If the answer to both of these questions is in the affirmative the source of the law is of no importance. In my opinion the Migratory Birds Convention Act is a law of general application in force in Ontario and applicable to the respondent but by s. 87 its application to him is made subject to the terms of the treaty of July 10, 1827. I would reject this ground of appeal.\nThe first ground presents more difficulty. In Sikyea\u2019s case, the judgment of Sissons J. acquitting Sikyea after a trial de novo was pronounced on November 1, 1962, and written reasons for that judgment were delivered on November 8, 1962. The unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal of the Northwest Territories was delivered on January 24, 1964. The reasons of the Court were written by Johnson J.A. The unanimous judgment of this Court upholding that of the Court of Appeal was delivered on October 6, 1964.\nIn the case at bar the judgment of McRuer C.J.H.C. was delivered on May 29, 1963. The learned Chief Justice referred to the judgment of Sissons J., which had not then been reversed, as follows:\nIn Reg. v. Sikyea, 40 W.W.R. 494, Sissons J.T.C. held that the Migratory Birds Convention Act did not apply to Indians hunting for food in the Northwest Territories. At page 504 he said:\nThere are no express words or necessary intendment or implication in the Migratory Birds Convention Act, abrogating, abridging, or infringing upon the hunting rights of the Indians.\nWith this I agree but I would go further. Since the Proclamation of 1763 has the force of a statute, I am satisfied that whatever power the Parliament of Canada may have to interfere with the treaty rights of the Indians, the rights conferred on them by the Proclamation cannot in any case be abrogated, abridged or infringed upon by an order\u2011in\u2011council passed under the Migratory Birds Convention Act.\nThe appeal to the Court of Appeal in the case at bar was argued on October 15, 1963, prior to the delivery of judgment by the Court of Appeal in Sikyea\u2019s case, but judgment was not delivered until June 24, 1964. The reasons delivered in the Court of Appeal contain no reference to the judgments in Sikyea\u2019s case.\nIn order to ascertain whether the question to be decided in the case at bar has been determined in Sikyea\u2019s case it is necessary to examine the reasons delivered in that case in some detail but before doing so it will be convenient to state in summary form the grounds on which Mr. Mackinnon submits that the cases are distinguishable. These are, (i) In Sikyea the question was as to the right of Indians to hunt on lands which they had surrendered while in the present case it is as to their right to hunt on lands which they reserved and have never surrendered, (ii) In Sikyea the treaty in question was entered into four years after the Migratory Birds Convention Act came into force while that in the present case was almost one hundred years earlier, and (iii) the reasons in Sikyea give no consideration to the effect of s. 87 of the Indian Act which in the present case was held by the Court of Appeal to be decisive. It is to the last of these three grounds of distinction that Mr. Mackinnon attaches particular importance.\nSissons J. in the course of his reasons reviewed the legislation which he regarded as applicable. He said in part:\nBy Sections 1 and 2 of Chapter 20 of the Statutes of Canada, 1960, assented to 9th June, 1960 the Northwest Territories Act was amended to provide that Ordinances by the Commissioner in Council in relation to the preservation of game in the Territories are applicable to and in respect of Indians and Eskimos; that this should not be construed as authorizing the Commissioner in Council to make Ordinances restricting or prohibiting Indians or Eskimos from hunting for food, on unoccupied Crown lands, other than game declared by the Governor in Council to be game in danger of becoming extinct, that from the day on which this Act comes into force the provisions of the various game ordinances including Chapter 42 R.O. 1956 and Chapter 2 of the Ordinances of 1960, Second Session, have the same force and effect in relations to Indians and Eskimos as if on that day they had been re-enacted in the same terms; that all laws of general application in force in the Territories are, except where otherwise provided, applicable to and in respect of Eskimos in the Territories.\nSection 1(3) of Chapter 20 reads as follows:\n1(3) Nothing in Subsection (2) shall be construed as authorizing the Commissioner in Council to make Ordinances restricting or prohibiting Indians or Eskimos from hunting for food, on unoccupied Crown lands, game other than game declared by the Governor in Council to be game in danger of becoming extinct.\nThe following Order in Council, P.C. 1960-1256, was passed the 14th day of September, 1960:\nHis Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Northern Affairs and National Resources, pursuant to subsection (3) of Section 14 of the Northwest Territories Act, is pleased hereby to declare musk-ox, barren-ground caribou and polar bear as game in danger of becoming extinct.\nIt is only necessary for the Governor in Council to \u2018declare\u2019 that game is in danger of becoming extinct. This may be fact or fiction, and may well be fiction.\nThere is here a recognition and a preservation by Parliament of the hunting rights of Indians and Eskimos, unrestricted except as to game in danger of becoming extinct. There is no mention of the Migratory Birds Convention Act or migratory birds.\nThis has the effect of nullifying any application of the Migratory Birds Convention Act to Indians and Eskimos.\nSection 2 of Chapter 20 reads:\n17(2) All laws of general application in force in the Territories, are, except where otherwise provided applicable to and in respect of Eskimos in the Territories.\nIt is \u2018otherwise provided\u2019, so far as Indians are concerned, by Section 87 of the Indian Act.\n87. Subject to the terms of any treaty and any other Act of the Parliament of Canada, all laws of general application from time to time in force in any province are applicable to and in respect of Indians in the province.\nI dealt with these amendments to the Northwest Territories Act in the case of Re Noah Estate, (1961) 36 W.W.R. 577:\nThe learned Judge does not make any other reference to s. 87 of the Indian Act and does not appear to found his judgment on its terms. The true ratio of his decision is found later in the following passage with which his reasons conclude:\nThe real defence and the important issue in this case is that the Migratory Birds Convention Act has no application to Indians engaged in the pursuit of their ancient right to hunt, trap and fish game and fish for food at all seasons of the year, on all unoccupied Crown lands.\nReference was made to the Royal Proclamation of October 7, 1763, cited in the Revised Statutes of Canada, Vol. VI, 6127, as the first of Canada\u2019s Constitutional Acts and Documents, and commonly spoken of as the Charter of Indian Rights; and to Treaty No. 11, made and concluded in 1921 between His Most Gracious Majesty George V, and the Slave, Dogrib, Loucheux, Hare and other Indians, inhabitants of the Territory; and to Rex v. Wesley, (1932) 58 C.C.C. 269, Regina v. Kogogoluk (1959) 28 WWR 376 and other cases.\nIndians still have their ancient hunting rights unless, adopting the words used by the Honourable Mr. Justice Gwynne of the Supreme Court of Canada, in the Ontario Mining Company v. Seybold, (1902) 32 S.C.R. 1, \u2018unless the proclamation of 1763 and the pledge of the Crown therein are considered now to be a dead letter; and unless the grave and solemn proceedings which ever since the issue of the proclamation until the present time have been pursued in practice upon the Crown entering into treaties with the Indians are to be regarded now as a delusive mockery\u2019.\nThe solemn proceedings surrounding Treaty No. 11 and the pledge given by the Crown and incorporated in the Treaty would indeed be delusive mockeries and deceitful in the highest degree if the Migratory Bird Convention, made just five years previously, had curtailed the hunting rights of the Indians.\nThere are no express words or necessary intendment or implication in the Migratory Birds Convention Act abrogating, abridging, or infringing upon the hunting rights of the Indians.\nThe various references in the Convention and in the Migratory Birds Convention Act and in the Regulations to Indians and Eskimos and their hunting rights indicate recognition of these hunting rights.\nThe fact that Indians and Eskimos are particularly entitled to take certain migratory game birds and migratory nongame birds does not indicate an intention to abrogate, abridge or infringe the hunting rights of these Indians and Eskimos.\nI find that the Migratory Birds Convention Act has no application to Indians hunting for food, and does not curtail their hunting rights.\nI find the accused Not Guilty. The Appeal is allowed.\nOn a consideration of the whole of the reasons of the learned Judge it appears to me that the ground of his decision is that the general words of the Migratory Birds Convention Act and Regulations should not be construed to take away the special rights to hunt enjoyed by the Indians from time immemorial and assured to them by the Proclamation of 1763 and by treaty. He does not say that the provisions of the Migratory Birds Convention Act and Regulations are, by force of s. 87 of the Indian Act, in respect of Indians made subject to the terms of any treaty. In other words, the learned Judge did not find it necessary to deal with the argument based on s. 87 which was addressed to us in the case at bar.\nIn the Court of Appeal Johnson J.A. makes no reference to s. 87. He differs from Sissons J. as to the true construction of the Migratory Birds Convention Act. He says:\nSissons J. in his reasons for judgment says:\nThere are no express words or necessary intendment or implication in the Migratory Birds Convention Act abrogating, abridging or infringing upon the hunting rights of the Indians.\nI have quoted section 5(1) of the regulations which says that \u2018no person shall kill a migratory bird at any time except during an open season\u2026\u2019. It is difficult to see how this language admits of any exceptions. When, however, we find that reference in both the Convention and in the regulations to what kind of birds an Indian and Eskimo may \u2018take\u2019 at any time for food, it is impossible for me to say that the hunting rights of the Indians as to these migratory birds, have not been abrogated, abridged or infringed upon.\nIt is, I think, quite clear that the rights given to the Indians by their treaties as they apply to migratory birds have been taken away by this Act and its regulations. How are we to explain this apparent breach of faith on the part of the government, for I cannot think it can be described in any other terms? This cannot be described as a minor or insignificant curtailment of these treaty rights, for game birds have always been a most plentiful, a most reliable and a readily obtainable food in large areas of Canada. I cannot believe that the Government of Canada realized that in implementing the Convention they were at the same time breaching the treaties that they had made with the Indians. It is much more likely that these obligations under the treaties were overlooked\u2014a case of the left hand having forgotten what the right hand had done.\n* * *\nI can come to no other conclusion than that the Indians, notwithstanding the rights given to them by their treaties, are prohibited by this Act and its regulations from shooting migratory birds out of season.\nThe questions of law decided by Johnson J.A. (and therefore by this Court since it adopted his reasons as well as his conclusion) in so far as they are relevant to the case at bar were (i) that it is within the power of Parliament to abrogate the rights of Indians to hunt whether arising from treaty or under the Proclamation of 1763 or from user from time immemorial and (ii) that on its true construction the Migratory Birds Convention Act shews that it was the intention of Parliament to prohibit Indians from hunting during the closed seasons subject only to the exceptions in their favour set out in the Act as, for example, the right to take scoters for food. I think it clear from reading the whole of the reasons of Johnson J.A. that he did not direct his mind to the question, so fully argued before us in the case at bar, whether accepting his decision on these two questions the effect of s. 87 of the Indian Act was to preserve the Indian\u2019s right to hunt notwithstanding the provisions of the Migratory Birds Convention Act in so far as that right was assured to them by \u201cany treaty\u201d. I think that if the view of the effect of s. 87 which appears to me to be decisive in the case at bar had been considered in the Court of Appeal or in this Court in Sikyea\u2019s case it would have been examined and dealt with in the reasons delivered. I do not propose to enter on the question, which since 1949 has been raised from time to time by authors, whether this Court now that it has become the final Court of Appeal for Canada is, as in the case of the House of Lords, bound by its own previous decisions on questions of law or whether, as in the case of the Judicial Committee or the Supreme Court of the United States, it is free under certain circumstance to reconsider them. I find it unnecessary to do this. Assuming for the purposes of this appeal that we are governed by the rule of stare decisis, it appears to me that the judgment in Sikyea falls within one of the exceptions to that rule in that it was given per incuriam.\nIn Young v. Bristol Aeroplane Co. Ltd.[4], Lord Greene M.R., giving the unanimous judgment of the full Court, said at pages 728 and 729:\nIt remains to consider the recent case of Lancaster Motor Co. (London) v. Bremith Ld., in which a court consisting of the present Master of the Rolls, Clauson L.J. and Goddard L.J. declined to follow an earlier decision of a court consisting of Slesser L.J. and Romer L.J. in Gerard v. Worth of Paris Ld. This was clearly a case where the earlier decision was given per incuriam. It depended on the true meaning (which in the later decision was regarded as clear beyond argument) of a rule of the Supreme Court to which the court was apparently not referred and which it obviously had not in mind. The Rules of the Supreme Court have statutory force and the court is bound to give effect to them as to a statute. Where the court has construed a statute or a rule having the force of a statute its decision stands on the same footing as any other decision on a question of law, but where the court is satisfied that an earlier decision was given in ignorance of the terms of a statute or a rule having the force of a statute the position is very different. It cannot, in our opinion, be right to say that in such a case the court is entitled to disregard the statutory provision and is bound to follow a decision of its own given when that provision was not present to its mind. Cases of this description are examples of decisions given per incuriam.\nI do not suggest that in Sikyea\u2019s case either the Court of Appeal or this Court was ignorant of the existence of s. 87 of the Indian Act but, to use the words of Lord Greene, I am satisfied that that section was not present to the mind of either Court when rendering judgment, although it does appear to have been dealt with in the argument of counsel.\nHaving reached this conclusion it is not necessary for me to consider the other grounds on which Mr. Mackinnon argued that Sikyea\u2019s case could be distinguished.\nIn St. Saviour\u2019s Southwark (Churchwardens)[5] case, Lord Coke said:\nIf two constructions may be made of the King\u2019s grant, then the rule is, when it may receive two constructions, and by force of one construction the grant may according to the rule of law be adjudged good, and by another it shall by law be adjudged bad; then for the King\u2019s honour, and for the benefit of the subject, such construction shall be made that the King\u2019s charter shall take effect, for it was not the King\u2019s intent to make a void grant, and therewith agrees Sir J. Moleyn\u2019s case in the sixth part of my reports.\nWe should, I think, endeavour to construe the treaty of 1827 and those Acts of Parliament which bear upon the question before us in such manner that the honour of the Sovereign may be upheld and Parliament not made subject to the reproach of having taken away by unilateral action and without consideration the rights solemnly assured to the Indians and their posterity by treaty. Johnson J.A., with obvious regret, felt bound to hold that Parliament had taken away those rights, but I am now satisfied that on its true construction s. 87 of the Indian Act shews that Parliament was careful to preserve them. At the risk of repetition I think it clear that the effect of s. 87 is two-fold. It makes Indians subject to the laws of general application in force in the province in which they reside but at the same time it preserves inviolate to the Indians whatever rights they have under the terms of any treaty so that in a case of conflict between the provisions of the laws and the terms of the treaty the latter shall prevail. For the reasons given by Roach J.A. and those stated above I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nThe judgment of Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Hall JJ. was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014I have had the opportunity to read the; reasons stated by my brother Cartwright. The facts giving rise to this appeal are there reviewed and it is unnecessary to repeat them here. With great respect, I am unable to agree with his interpretation of s. 87 of the Indian Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 149, which provides as follows:\n87. Subject to the terms of any treaty and any other Act of the Parliament of Canada, all laws of general application from time to time in force in any province are applicable to and in respect of Indians in the province, except to the extent that such laws are inconsistent with this Act or any order, rule, regulation or by-law made thereunder, and except to the extent that such laws make provision for any matter for which provision is made by or under this Act.\nI cannot construe this section as making the provisions of the Migratory Birds Convention Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 179, subordinate to the treaty of July 10, 1827. In my opinion, it was not the purpose of s. 87 to make any legislation of the Parliament of Canada subject to the terms of any treaty. I understand the object and intent of that section is to make Indians, who are under the exclusive legislative jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada, by virtue of s. 91(24) of the British North America Act, 1867, subject to provincial laws of general application.\nThe application of provincial laws to Indians was, however, made subject to \u201cthe terms of any treaty and any other Act of the Parliament of Canada\u201d (the italics are mine). In addition, provincial laws inconsistent with the Indian Act, or any order, rule, regulation or by-law made thereunder, or making provision for any matter for which provision is made under that Act, do not apply.\nThe incorporation in the section of the words italicized to me makes it clear that when the section refers to \u201claws of general application from time to time in force in any province\u201d it did not include in that expression the statute law of Canada. If it did, the section, in so far as federal legislation is concerned, would provide that the statute law of Canada applies to Indians, subject to the terms of any Act of the Parliament of Canada, other than the Indian Act. This would be a rather unusual provision, particularly in view of the fact that it did not require any express provision in the Indian Act to make Indians subject to the provisions of federal statutes. In my view the expression refers only to those rules of law in a province which are provincial in scope, and would include provincial legislation and any laws which were made a part of the law of a province, as, for example, in the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, the laws of England as they existed on July 15, 1870.\nThis section was not intended to be a declaration of the paramountcy of treaties over federal legislation. The reference to treaties was incorporated in a section the purpose of which was to make provincial laws applicable to Indians, so as to preclude any interference with rights under treaties resulting from the impact of provincial legislation.\nAccordingly, in my opinion, the provisions of s. 87 do not prevent the application to Indians of the provisions of the Migratory Birds Convention Act. I can see no valid distinction between the present case and that of Sikyea v. The Queen[6] and, for the reasons given in that case, I think that this appeal should be allowed. The judgment of the learned magistrate should be reversed and a fine of ten dollars be imposed upon the respondent. The Attorney-General of Canada does not ask for costs, and accordingly there should be no costs in this Court or in the Courts below.\nAppeal allowed, CARTWRIGHT J. dissenting; no order as to costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: E.A.

The respondent and C Ltd. were closely related companies in that the ownership and management of each were the same and their operations were interrelated. On September 26, 1962, the appellant union local applied to the Labour Relations Board (B.C.) for certification for bakers employed by the respondent. On receipt of notice of this application, the respondent, by its solicitors, advised the Board that it did not have a bakery department, that the bakery was owned and operated by C Ltd. Thereupon the Board notified C Ltd. that the local had applied for certification for all employees employed in its bakery department. On October 16, 1962, the Board certified the local as the trade union for the said employees. Notice was then given by the local to C Ltd. to commence collective bargaining and such bargaining was commenced and continued until November 24, 1962, when the employees were discharged. Meanwhile, the Board on November 8, 1962, ordered C Ltd. to cease the coercion or intimidation of its employees and on the same date ordered the company to reinstate two employees, the appellants S and N.\nOn November 24, 1962, C Ltd. went into voluntary liquidation, and, when so advised, the local along with S and N applied to the Board to have the order of October 16 and the three orders of November 8 amended by substituting the respondent as the named employer. The orders were accordingly amended by the Board on February 13, 1963, purportedly under s. 65(3) of the Labour Relations Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 205, as amended by 1961 (B.C.), c. 31. Subsequently, in certiorari proceedings, the four orders dated February 13, 1963, were quashed. An appeal from the judgment of the judge of first instance was dismissed by the Court of Appeal and the appellants then appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nIf the Board had jurisdiction to make the orders in question, this Court would not inquire into the merits of the decisions made. By s. 65(3) of the Labour Relations Act the Board was given power to vary or cancel any decision or order made under the provisions of the section. The procedure of the Board under s. 65(3) was correct and the orders were properly made. The Board was free to act or not act on the evidence before it as it saw fit and by statute the Board's decision was final and conclusive. This Court would not and must not interfere in what has been done within the Board's jurisdiction. Rex v. Nat Bell Liquors Ltd., [1922] 2 A.C. 128 referred to; Labour Relations Board et al. v. Oliver Co-operative Growers Exchange, [1963] S.C.R. 7, applied.\nThe view expressed in the Court below that the word \"vary\" in s. 65(3) cannot apply retroactively was not accepted. It has not such a limited meaning and circumstances will frequently arise where it must have a retroactive effect. The present case was a classical example.\nThe Board had jurisdiction to entertain the application to vary. Nothing in the record or in the affidavits showed that it lost jurisdiction for any of the reasons which the law recognizes as ousting jurisdiction, i.e., bias, interest, fraud, denial of natural justice or want of qualification.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] , dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Sullivan J. quashing four orders of the British Columbia Labour Relations Board. Appeal allowed.\nA. B. Macdonald, for the appellants.\nHon. C. H. Locke, Q.C., and H. S. Mahon, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nHALL J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the Court of Appeal of British Columbia[2] which sustained an order by Sullivan J. in certiorari proceedings quashing four orders of the Labour Relations Board dated February 13, 1963. These orders purport to have been made under s. 65(3) of the Labour Relations Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 205, as amended by 1961, c. 31. That section reads:\n(3) The Board may, upon the petition of any employer, employers' organization, trade-union, or other person, or of its own motion, reconsider any decision or order made by it under this Act, and may vary or cancel any such decision or order, and for the purposes of the Act the certification of a trade-union is a decision of the Board. The original orders which the orders of February 13, 1963, purported to amend were made on October 16, 1962, and November 8, 1962. The effect of the amendment in each case was to substitute as the employer named in each order the respondent, White Lunch Limited, in place of Clancy's Pastries Limited which had gone into voluntary liquidation on November 24, 1962, in the circumstances later set out.\nIt is necessary to follow closely the events as they occurred to determine if the Labour Relations Board had jurisdiction to amend the said orders as it purported to do on February 13, 1963.\nThe respondent, White Lunch Limited, is a corporation engaged in the restaurant business, and by itself or related companies carried on the business of a bakery as well as retail outlets for bakery products. Clancy's Pastries Limited was incorporated on June 24, 1947. It was closely related to the respondent company in that:\n(a) Their shares were owned by the same individuals.\n(b) They had the same general manager, Keith T. Sorensen and the same president, Clarence L. Sorensen.\n(c) Their operations were interrelated, as bakers, retail stores or restaurants.\nFrom December 30, 1949, to September 18, 1962, the Cafeteria and Coffee Shop Employees Association had been certified as the bargaining authority for a unit of employees of Clancy's Pastries Limited. On September 18, 1962, the Labour Relations Board (hereinafter referred to as the \"Board\") cancelled that certification upon being satisfied that said Association had ceased to represent the employees of the unit. This terminated any collective bargaining agreement then in effect.\nThat was the situation when on September 26, 1962, the appellant Local 468 applied to the Board for certification for bakers employed by the respondent. Due notice of the application was given to the respondent. That notice read as follows:\n(COAT OF ARMS)\nTHE GOVERNMENT OF THE\nPROVINCE OF BRITISH COLUMBIA\nLABOUR RELATIONS BOARD\nDEPARTMENT OF LABOUR\nWhite Lunch Limited,\n(Bakery Department)\nSeptember 26th, 1962,\n124 West Hastings St.,\nVictoria, B.C.\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\nThis is to advise you that the Bakery and Confectionery Workers' International Union of America, Local No. 468\nhas applied to be certified for a unit of employees of White Lunch Limited, (Bakery Department)\nbeing all employees\nemployed in the bakery department at 124 West Hastings Street Vancouver, B.C.\nAn officer of the Department of Labour will investigate to learn the merits of this application, and will apply to you for certain information.

Pender Street, Vancouver, B.C.\nEMPLOYED in the bakery department at 124 West Hastings\nStreet, Vancouver, B.C.\nexcept those excluded by the Act,\nare a unit appropriate for collective bargaining, and is satisfied that\nthe Bakery and Confectionery Workers' International Union of\nAmerica, Local No. 468,\nhas complied with the requirements of the Act, and for the\npurposes of collective bargaining\nTHEREFORE HEREBY CERTIFIED\nit \u2026as the trade union(s) for all the employees in the said unit.\nGiven at Victoria, B.C. this 16th day of October, A. D.1962.\nLABOUR RELATIONS BOARD\nBy \"W. H. SANDS\"\nChairman Upon this order having been made, notice was given by Local 468 on October 10, 1962, to Clancy's to commence collective bargaining. Bargaining was commenced, some wage increase being offered but nothing else. Bargaining continued until November 24, 1962, when the employees were discharged.\nMeanwhile differences had arisen. On October 10, 1962, the Secretary of Local 468 complained to the Board under s. 4(2) (c) of the Labour Relations Act that Clancy's was seeking by intimidation, by dismissal, by threat of dismissal, or by any other kind of threat to prevent the employees from organizing into a union. The Board heard this complaint and on November 8,1962, made the following order:\n(COAT OF ARMS)\nTHE GOVERNMENT OF THE\nPROVINCE OF BRITISH COLUMBIA\nDEPARTMENT OF LABOUR\nLABOUR RELATIONS BOARD\nVICTORIA\nORDER\nPursuant to Section 7 of the Labour Relations Act, the Labour Relations Board directs Clancy's Pastries Limited to cease using coercion or intimidation of any kind that could reasonably have the effect of compelling or inducing any person to refrain from becoming or continuing to be a member of a trade-union.\nMade and Given at Victoria, B.C., this 8th day of November, A.D. 1962.\nLABOUR RELATIONS BOARD\nBy \"W. H. SANDS\"\nChairman\nIn this same period other conflicts arose. Two employees, the appellants Salmi and Nielsen, complained to the Board that they had been discharged in contravention of s. 4(2) (d) of the Labour Relations Act. Their complaints were heard by the Board which also on November 8, 1962, made the following order in respect of the appellant Nielsen: (COAT OF ARMS)\nTHE GOVERNMENT OF THE\nPROVINCE OF BRITISH COLUMBIA\nDEPARTMENT OF LABOUR\nLABOUR RELATIONS BOARD\nVICTORIA\nORDER\nWHEREAS on inquiry the Labour Relations Board is satisfied that Clancy's Pastries Limited, an employer, has done an act prohibited by Section 4(2) (d) of the Labour Relations Act, in that it discharged Svend Nielsen, an employee, contrary to the provisions thereof;\nNow THEREFORE, pursuant to Section 7(4) of the said Act, the Labour Relations Board hereby orders Clancy's Pastries Limited to cease doing the act prohibited, and directs it to rectify the act by forthwith reinstating the said Svend Nielsen, and further directs Clancy's Pastries Limited to pay to Svend Nielsen a sum equal to the wages lost by reason of his discharge.\nMade and Given at Victoria, B.C., this 8th day of November, A.D. 1962.\nLABOUR RELATIONS BOARD\nBy \"W. H. SANDS\"\nChairman\nand on the same day made an identical order in respect of the appellant Salmi.\nThese three orders of November 8 and the order of October 16 are the orders which the Board purported to amend on February 13, 1963. The jurisdiction of the Board to make the three orders of November 8, 1962, has not been questioned.\nThe applications to amend were made after the appellants became aware that Clancy's had gone into voluntary liquidation.\nIt is relevant to review the events which relate particularly to Clancy's going into voluntary liquidation.\nWhen the first steps were being taken by Local 468 to organize the employees in question here into a bargaining unit and to be certified as the trade union for all the employees of the said unit, which was in August 1962, some rumour gained credence that Clancy's would go out of business. This acquires some significance when considered along with the respondent's reply to the application for certification that Clancy's was the employer and not the respondent. The solicitors for the respondent were at some pains to deny that any such step was being contemplated in their letter of October 12, 1962, to the Board. That letter read in part:\nMy instructions are that some time in August a rumor circulated through Clancy's Pastries Limited that the bakery was to be closed. As a result of this, one of the managers was instructed to inform the bakery employees that the rumor was untrue, that the bakery was not to be closed. Where the rumor originated is unknown, but apparently it originated with some company supplier.\nThe fact is that very soon after the certification order of October 16 was made, steps were instituted to wind up Clancy's. The resolution to go into voluntary liquidation was passed by the shareholders of the company at a meeting on November 24. That meeting required shareholders to have not less than 14 days' notice of the special resolution. (Companies Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 67, s. 173(4)). Yet nothing was said about this impending voluntary liquidation when the parties were before the Board on November 8. Nothing was said to the employees about the company going into liquidation when the employees were discharged on November 24. The first intimation to the Board and to the employees of the liquidation proceedings was contained in the solicitors' letter of December 13, 1962, when the fact of being in liquidation was given as a defence to a complaint that the employees dismissed on November 24 had been discharged unlawfully. The reason for liquidation was stated by Keith T. Sorensen, the company's general manager at pp. 95 and 96 of the case as follows:\n98 Q. When you say that Clancy's Pastries Limited voluntarily wound up in paragraph 11 of your affidavit, by special resolution. Who initiated that winding up? How did it come up?\nA. Well, a meeting of the shareholders was called.\n99 Q. When was that? On the date this resolution was passed?\nA. Yes.\n100 Q. Was the meeting called for this purpose, to consider winding up?\nA. Yes. It was called to decide whether the company, Clancy's\nPastries Limited, should continue operation or not, and at the meeting it was decided that in view of the fact that the offer which we had made which we considered to be the highest offer we could make and still make a profit, that when that was refused, we decided, the shareholders decided that there was no point in continuing in business, so that\u2014\nWhen advised of the liquidation of Clancy's, Local 468, along with the appellants Salmi and Nielsen applied to the Board to have the order of October 16 and the three orders of November 8 amended by substituting the respondent as the named employer and for variance of the certificate of October 16, 1962, to name the employer as White Lunch Limited.\nThe Board fixed Wednesday, February 13, 1963, at 2:00 p.m. in the Board Room in Vancouver as the date, time and place of the hearing to amend the orders. The respondent was represented at this hearing both by counsel and by its general manager.\nAfter hearing evidence including Exhibit W to the affidavit of Clarence L. Sorensen which produced a T4 Income Tax slip in respect of the appellant Nielsen which read as follows:\nCANADA\nT4-1960\nSupplementary\nSvend Nielsen White Lunch Limited\n3081 East 8th Ave. 133 West Pender St.\nVancouver, B.C.\nVancouver, B.C.\n238-165\n2500\n12\n4174.83\nWHITE LUNCH LIMITED\nClarence L. Sorensen President\nThomas Sorensen Vice President\nGunde E. Frostrup Sec. Treas.\nKeith Sorensen General Manager\nand a letter dated June 15, 1962, as follows:\nJune 15, 1962\nTO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:\nThis is to verify that the bearer of this letter Svend Nielsen of 3081 East 8th Avenue, is an employee of our Company. He is a baker in our bakery and has worked there since October 27, 1958.\nWHITE LUNCH LIMITED\n\"Frances E. Reynolds\"\n(Miss) Frances E. Reynolds\nInterviewer the Board made the orders in question here.\nIf the Board had jurisdiction, this Court will not inquire into the merits of the decisions made. Section 65 under which the Board purported to act contains a privative clause which reads in part:\n65. (1) If in any proceeding before the Board a question arises under this Act as to whether\n(a) a person is an employer or employee;\n***\n(e) A person is or what persons are parties to a collective agreement; the Board shall decide the question, and its decision shall be final and conclusive.\nThe provisions of s. 65(3) read:\n(3) The Board may, upon the petition of any employer, employers' organization, trade-union, or other person, or of its own motion, reconsider any decision or order made by it under this Act, and may vary or cancel any such decision or order, and for the purposes of the Act the certification of a trade-union is a decision of the Board.\nThe respondent's main contention is that s. 65(3) does not give the Board jurisdiction to amend the orders previously made in the manner done on February 13, 1962. Counsel for the respondent, citing well-known authorities, emphasized that the provisions of the Labour Relations Act being in derogation of common law rights should be strictly construed. On the other hand, counsel for the appellants urged that the Labour Relations Act was remedial legislation and should be liberally construed.\nWhatever merit the arguments of the respondent had at the beginning of labour relations legislation, it seems to me that in the stage of industrial development now existing it must be accepted that legislation to achieve industrial peace and to provide a forum for the quick determination of labour-management disputes is legislation in the public interest, beneficial to employee and employer and not something to be whittled to a minimum or narrow interpretation in the face of the expressed will of legislatures which, in enacting such legislation, were aware that common law rights were being altered because of industrial development and mass employment which rendered illusory the so-called right of the individual to bargain individually with the corporate employer of the mid-twentieth century.\nThe language of s. 65(3) is clear. The Board has been given power to vary or cancel any decision or order made under the provisions of the section. The remarks of Judson J. in Labour Relations Board et al. v. Oliver Co-operative Growers Exchange[3] are applicable here. In that case, some nine Union Locals had been certified for a unit employed by twenty-three employers in thirty packing houses in the Okanagan Valley. The nine Locals resolved to merge and became part of one new Union under the name of Oliver Co-operative Growers Exchange. The new Union applied under s. 65(2) (now 65(3)) of the Labour Relations Act to amend the certificate to substitute its name for that of the locals of the old Union. It followed the result would necessarily be the substitution of a new party in the Certificate of Bargaining Authority. In these circumstances, Judson J. said at p. 11:\nThe majority in the Court of Appeal held that the Board's power under s. 65(2) and regulation 9(a) was limited to the substitution of a new name for an old and that the word \"vary\" in s. 65(2) could not support the substitution of another union for that set out in a Certificate of Bargaining Authority. That would amount to a new and different certification, a replacement of one union by another, a change that could only be brought about by following the procedure laid down by ss. 10 and 12. The decision is that Local 1572, being a new union, should have applied for certification and not variation of an existing certificate and that variation of a certificate in the circumstances of this case was beyond the powers of the Board. The learned judge of first instance and Davey J.A., in the Court of Appeal, were of a contrary opinion and held that the Board had jurisdiction under s. 65(2). I am of the opinion that this is the correct view to take of the Act.\nThere is no dispute that the procedure of the Board under s. 65(2) was correct. Every interested party had knowledge of what was being done and was given an opportunity to be heard. It is of some significance that out of 23 employers, only this particular respondent-employer opposed the application. That, of course, does not cure a defect if it is one of lack of jurisdiction.\nIt is equally beyond dispute that no attempt was made to proceed under ss. 10 and 12 of the Act dealing with certification and decertification. The gist of the decision of Davey J.A., with which I fully agree, is that it was unnecessary to proceed under ss. 10 and 12 and that the certification procedures of s. 10 and s. 12 of the Act were appropriate when a union seeks initial certification or contending unions seek certification but not to the case of a successor union resulting from a merger or reorganization. He held that s. 65(2) conferred upon the Board an entirely independent power to vary or revoke a former order in appropriate circumstances and that this included power to deal with cases not specifically provided for by the Act and which were outside the ordinary operation of s. 10 and s. 12.\nThis recognition of a plenary independent power of the Board under s. 65(2) of the Act has the support of two prior decisions, that of Clyne J. on the British Columbia Act in In re Hotel and Restaurant Employees\u2019 International Union, Local 28 et al., (1954) 11 W.W.R. (N.S.) 11 at 17, [1954] 1 D.L.R. 772, and that of McRuer C.J.H.C. and the Court of Appeal in Regina v. Ontario Labour Relations Board, Ex parte Genaire Ltd., [1958] O.R. 637, affd. (1959) 18 D.L.R. (2d) 588, sub nom. International Association of Machinists v. Genaire Ltd. and Ontario Labour Relations Board, where the corresponding section of the Ontario Labour Relations Act was considered. It is, in my opinion, a very necessary power to enable the Board to do its work efficiently and the present case affords an illustration of the need for it. Employees in a certain industry, organized in nine locals, decide to combine in one local of a new union, which performs the same function as the fragmented union and presents a continuity of interest, property, management, representation and personnel.\nI may paraphrase Judson J.'s remarks by pointing out that here the orders of February 13 were properly made. Every interested party had notice of the applications and was given an opportunity to be heard. Cogent evidence was led that the employees in question had at all times been the employees of the respondent. The Board had knowledge that the original application named the respondent as the employer and that the substitution of Clancy's as the employer in the subsequent proceedings came as the result of the solicitors' letter of October 1. It had also evidence of the move to put Clancy's into voluntary liquidation at the very time officers of Clancy's who were also president and general manager of the respondent were purporting to be bargaining collectively under the order of October 16. The Board was free to act or not act on that evidence as it saw fit and by statute its decision is final and conclusive. This Court will not and must not interfere in what has been done within the Board's jurisdiction for, as stated by Lord Sumner in Rex v. Nat Bell Liquors Ltd.[4] , in so doing: \u2026it would itself, in turn, transgress the limits within which its own jurisdiction of supervision, not of review, is confined. That supervision goes to two points: one is the area of the inferior jurisdiction and the qualifications and conditions of its exercise; the other is the observance of the law in the course of its exercise.\nBull J.A. in the Court of Appeal recognized the wide effect of s. 65(3) when he said:\nIt is clear that Section 65(3) confers the power to vary or cancel a former order or decision in appropriate circumstances, that this power is intended to cover situations which are not specifically dealt with in the Statute, and that the Board is not restricted merely to the facts as they existed when the original order or decision was made: In re Hotel and Restaurant Employees' International Union, Local 28 et al (1954) 11 W.W.R. (N.S.) 11; Regina v. Ontario Lab. Rel. Bd.; Ex parte Genaire Ltd. [1958] O.R. 637, approved on appeal (1959) 18 D.L.R. (2d) 588.\nSimilarly, it is well established law that when there is a privative clause such as Section 65(1) the Court in certiorari proceedings is restricted to determining whether or not the tribunal, in this case the Board of Labour Relations, acted within its jurisdiction, including matters such as denial of natural justice, bias, fraud, etc., or whether there is error on the face of the record. In the disposition of issues within its jurisdiction, the Board's decision, including certification of a trade-union, is not open to judicial review, unless the Court determines that the Board's error goes to jurisdiction as opposed to an error within its jurisdiction. The decision of the Board as to who are employees and who are employers is a finding solely within the jurisdiction of the Board and is \"final and conclusive\" and not open to judicial review: Labour Relations Board et al. v. Traders' Service Ltd. [1958] S.C.R. 672.\nHowever, he limited the effect of s. 65(3) by holding that the word \"vary\" in the section \"cannot be used as an excuse for bringing retroactively into being a new unit of employees for which the Union stands certified\u2026\". I cannot read the section as narrowing the plain meaning of the word \"vary\". It is defined in the Shorter Oxford Dictionary as: \"to cause to change or alter; to adapt to certain circumstances or requirements by appropriate modifications\" nor do I accept the view that the word \"vary\" cannot apply retroactively. It has not such a limited meaning and circumstances will frequently arise where it must have a retroactive effect. The present case is a classical example.\nThe Board had jurisdiction to entertain the application to vary. Nothing in the record or in the affidavits shows that it lost jurisdiction for any of the reasons which the law recognizes as ousting jurisdiction, i.e., bias, interest, fraud, denial of natural justice or want of qualification.\nThe appeal should accordingly be allowed with costs here and in the Courts below and the application to quash the orders in question should be dismissed.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: Alex B. Macdonald, Vancouver.\nSolicitor for the respondent: S. H. Mahon, Vancouver.\n[1] (1965), 51 D.L.R. (2d) 72, sub nom. Regina v. B.C.

Pursuant to s. 45(8) of the Patent Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 203, the plaintiff filed a statement of claim in the Exchequer Court in which it included claims other than those in conflict before the Commissioner of Patents. The defendant filed a notice of motion to strike out the parts of the statement of claim which were not confined to the claims in conflict before the Commissioner. The motion was granted by the Exchequer Court. The plaintiff appealed to this Court. Held: The appeal should be dismissed.\nProceedings under s. 45(8) of the Patent Act are restricted to a determination of the respective rights of the parties in respect of the subject matter of the claims put in conflict by the Commissioner of Patents.\nSection 21 of the Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 98, does not confer upon the plaintiff the right to the relief which was sought by the impugned parts of the statement of claim. The conclusion which is to be drawn from the legislative history of the provisions of the Patent Act respecting conflicting applications is that, although jurisdiction is conferred upon the Exchequer Court by s. 21 of the Exchequer Court Act in cases of conflicting applications for a patent, the right of a party involved in such a conflict to attack the patent application of another party is governed by s. 45 of the Patent Act, and such party is restricted to such rights as are conferred by that section.\nBrevets\u2014Proc\u00e9dure\u2014Requ\u00eate pour faire radier partie de la d\u00e9claration produite devant la Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier\u2014Les proc\u00e9dures devant cette Cour doivent-elles \u00eatre restreintes aux revendications qui sont en conflit devant le Commissaire des Brevets\u2014Loi sur les Brevets, S.R.C. 1952, c. 203, art. 45\u2014Loi sur la Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier, S.R.C. 1952, c. 98, art. 21.\nLors de proc\u00e9dures concernant des revendications en conflit au sujet de brevets pour inventions se rapportant \u00e0 la t\u00e9l\u00e9vision en couleurs, le Commissaire des Brevets a accord\u00e9 certaines des revendications \u00e0 la demanderesse et les autres \u00e0 la d\u00e9fenderesse. En vertu de l'art. 45(8) de la Loi sur les Brevets, S.R.C. 1952, c. 203, la demanderesse a produit une d\u00e9claration devant la Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier dans laquelle elle a inclus d'autres revendications que celles qui \u00e9taient en conflit devant le Commissaire des Brevets. La d\u00e9fenderesse a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate pour faire radier les parties de la d\u00e9claration qui n'\u00e9taient pas restreintes aux revendications en conflit devant le Commissaire.

La demanderesse en appela devant cette Cour.\nArr\u00eat: L'appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9.\nLes proc\u00e9dures sous le r\u00e9gime de l'art. 45(8) de la Loi sur les Brevets sont limit\u00e9es \u00e0 la d\u00e9termination des droits respectifs des parties relativement \u00e0 la mati\u00e8re en litige des revendications qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mises en conflit par le Commissaire des Brevets.\nL'art. 21 de la Loi sur la Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier, S.R.C. 1952, c. 98, ne donne pas \u00e0 la demanderesse le droit au recours qu'elle a recherch\u00e9 par les parties de la d\u00e9claration qui sont attaqu\u00e9es. La conclusion que l'on doit tirer de l'historique l\u00e9gislatif des dispositions de la Loi sur les Brevets concernant les demandes en conflit est \u00e0 l'effet que, quoique l'art. 21 de la Loi sur la Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier conf\u00e8re \u00e0 la Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier la juridiction dans les cas de demandes pour brevets qui sont en conflit, le droit de la partie engag\u00e9e dans un tel conflit d'attaquer la demande de brevets d'une autre partie est gouvern\u00e9 par l'art. 45 de la Loi sur les Brevets et cette partie est restreinte aux seuls droits qui sont conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par cet article\nAPPEL d'un jugement du Pr\u00e9sident Jackett de la Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier du Canada[1] , radiant certains paragraphes de la d\u00e9claration. Appel rejet\u00e9.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Jackett P. of the Exchequer Court of Canada[2] , striking out certain paragraphs of the statement of claim. Appeal dismissed.\nChristopher Robinson, Q.C., and Russell S. Smart, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nDavid Watson and Edwin A. Foster, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014This appeal is from a judgment of the learned President of the Exchequer Court[3] which, upon a motion brought by the respondent, struck out paragraphs 10 to 19 inclusive of the appellant's amended statement of claim and also paragraph (a) of the prayer of that statement of claim. The question in issue on the appeal involves the interpretation of s. 45 of the Patent Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 203, and of s. 21 of the Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 98.\nThe action was brought by the appellant, as plaintiff, against the respondent, as defendant, following a decision of the Commissioner of Patents, dated December 13, 1963, in a conflict between patent application Serial Number 606,877, filed on October 17, 1950, by C. W. Hansell, as inventor, and assigned to the appellant, and patent application Serial Number 609,764, filed on December 29, 1950, by Wilson P. Boothroyd and Edgar M. Creamer, and assigned to the respondent. The former is entitled \"Color Transmission System\" and the latter \"Electrical Intelligence Transmission System\".\nSection 45 of the Patent Act, which is headed \"CONFLICTING APPLICATIONS\", provides as follows: 45. (1) Conflict between two or more pending applications exists\n(a) when each of them contains one or more claims defining substantially the same invention, or\n(b) when one or more claims of one application describe the invention disclosed in the other application.\n(2) When the Commissioner has before him two or more such applications he shall notify each of the applicants of the apparent conflict and transmit to each of them a copy of the conflicting claims, together with a copy of this section; the Commissioner shall give to each applicant the opportunity of inserting the same or similar claims in his application within a specified time.\n(3) Where each of two or more of such completed applications contains one or more claims describing as new, and claims an exclusive property or privilege in, things or combinations so nearly identical that, in the opinion of the Commissioner, separate patents to different patentees should not be granted, the Commissioner shall forthwith notify each of the applicants to that effect.\n(4) Each of the applicants, within a time to be fixed by the Commissioner, shall either avoid the conflict by the amendment or cancellation of the conflicting claim or claims, or, if unable to make such claims owing to knowledge of prior art, may submit to the Commissioner such prior art alleged to anticipate the claims; thereupon each application shall be re-examined with reference to such prior art, and the Commissioner shall decide if the subject matter of such claims is patentable.\n(5) Where the subject matter is found to be patentable and the conflicting claims are retained in the applications, the Commissioner shall require each applicant to file in the Patent Office, in a sealed envelope duly endorsed, within a time specified by him, an affidavit of the record of the invention; the affidavit shall declare:\n(a) the date at which the idea of the invention described in the conflicting claims was conceived;\n(b) the date upon which the first drawing of the invention was made;\n(c) the date when and the mode in which the first written or verbal disclosure of the invention was made; and\n(d) the dates and nature of the successive steps subsequently taken by the inventor to develop and perfect the said invention from time to time up to the date of the filing of the application for patent.\n(6) No envelope containing any such affidavit as aforesaid shall be opened, nor shall the affidavit be permitted to be inspected, unless there continues to be a conflict between two or more applicants, in which event all the envelopes shall be opened at the same time by the Commissioner in the presence of the Assistant Commissioner or an examiner as witness thereto, and the date of such opening shall be endorsed upon the affidavits.\n(7) The Commissioner, after examining the facts stated in the affidavits, shall determine which of the applicants is the prior inventor to whom he will allow the claims in conflict and shall forward to each applicant a copy of his decision; a copy of each affidavit shall be transmitted to the several applicants. (8)The claims in conflict shall be rejected or allowed accordingly unless within a time to be fixed by the Commissioner and notified to the several applicants one of them commences proceedings in the Exchequer Court for the determination of their respective rights, in which event the Commissioner shall suspend further action on the applications in conflict until in such action it has been determined either\n(a) that there is in fact no conflict between the claims in question,\n(b) that none of the applicants is entitled to the issue of a patent containing the claims in conflict as applied for by him,\n(c) that a patent or patents, including substitute claims approved by the Court, may issue to one or more of the applicants, or\n(d) that one of the applicants is entitled as against the others to the issue of a patent including the claims in conflict as applied for by him.\n(9)The Commissioner shall, upon the request of any of the parties to a proceeding under this section, transmit to the Exchequer Court the papers on file in the Patent Office relating to the applications in conflict.\nOn September 18, 1961, the Commissioner notified the appellant and the respondent of a conflict between the two applications in respect of 12 claims, which he designated C1 to C12. Affidavits were filed by the parties, pursuant to subs. (5) of s. 45, and, after considering these, the Commissioner, pursuant to subs. (7), awarded claims C1 to C4 to the appellant, and claims C5 to C12 to the respondent.\nPursuant to subs. (8), the appellant filed a statement of claim in the Exchequer Court on March 12, 1964, claiming entitlement to claims C5 to C12. On April 8 the respondent filed a statement of defence and a counterclaim claiming entitlement to claims C1 to C4.\nOn November 23, 1964, the appellant filed an amended statement of claim, which added additional paragraphs 10 to 19 inclusive and a new prayer.\nOn January 25, 1965, the respondent filed a notice of motion to strike out the amendments. This motion was successful, save as to paragraph 18, as to which there is no cross-appeal, and which is no longer in issue before this Court.\nThe amendments to the statement of claim, now in issue, attacked 78 of the claims in the respondent's application, in addition to those which the Commissioner had designated as C1 to C12. Of these 78 claims it was alleged that 21 were claims to subject matter disclosed in the appellant's application, that 30 were identical with claims in patents already granted to the appellant, that 17 were claims to subject matter disclosed in patents already granted to the appellant and that 10 were claims to subject matter known by one Sziklai before any invention by Boothroyd (the respondent's inventor) and disclosed to the public and to the respondent before the respondent's application was filed.\nThe point which is in issue on this appeal is as to whether the appellant had the right, in proceedings taken pursuant to s. 45(8), to attack claims contained in the respondent's application in relation to which no conflict had been found by the Commissioner.\nOn behalf of the appellant, it was contended that the possibility of such an attack being made was contemplated by the terms of s. 45 standing by itself, but that, in any event, such proceedings were authorized by s. 21 of the Exchequer Court Act.\nAt the conclusion of the argument for the appellant we stated our unanimous opinion that the first contention could not be successfully maintained. We were in agreement with the learned President, who stated his position in the following words:\nIn these circumstances, the question is whether the very special provision impliedly made by subsection (8) of section 45 for proceedings in this Court to determine the respective rights of the parties whose applications are in conflict is restricted to the respective rights in respect of the claims in conflict as dealt with by the Commissioner or whether that very special provision opens the door to an attack by either of the applicants on any of the claims set out in the other party's application no matter what the basis for that attack may be and no matter how remote such claims may be from the subject matter of the claims put in conflict by the Commissioner.\nI am of opinion that proceedings under section 45(8) are restricted to a determination of the respective rights of the parties in respect of the subject matter of the claims put in conflict by the Commissioner. Giving the best consideration that I can to section 45 as a whole and reading it in relation to the other provisions of the Act, I cannot read subsection (8) as applying to anything except the claims that have been dealt with pursuant to subsections (3) to (7) inclusive. I turn now to consider the effect of s. 21 of the Exchequer Court Act, which, it was submitted, permitted the course taken by the appellant by its amendment to the statement of claim. That section provides:\n21. The Exchequer Court has jurisdiction as well between subject and subject as otherwise,\n(a) in all cases of conflicting applications for any patent of invention, or for the registration of any copyright, trade mark or industrial design;\n(b) in all cases in which it is sought to impeach or annul any patent of invention, or to have any entry in any register of copyrights, trade marks or industrial designs made, expunged, varied or rectified; and\n(c) in all other cases in which a remedy is sought under the authority of any Act of the Parliament of Canada or at common law or in equity, respecting any patent of invention, copyright, trade mark, or industrial design.\nDealing with this issue, the learned President stated:\nWhile I recognize that the jurisdiction conferred on this Court by section 21 of the Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, chapter 98, may not extend to such parts of paragraphs 11 to 17 as do not form the basis for a claim in respect of conflicting applications, I am of opinion that what I have to decide is not to be determined by reference to that section. In my view, section 21confers jurisdiction on the Court where a right to relief exists, in the classes of cases therein defined, by virtue of some other statutory provision, at common law or in equity. (Unlike section 18(1) (c), section 21 does not create a right to relief as well as confer jurisdiction on the Court.) In addition to the jurisdiction conferred by section 21, the Court has jurisdiction wherever some statutory provision expressly imposes on the Court a duty to hear and determine some claim for relief in classes of cases not covered by section 21. Applications for patents of invention are creatures of the Patent Act. No right to obtain relief from a Court in respect thereto exists except where such right has been conferred expressly or impliedly by some statute and, as far as I am aware, the only statute that deals with such applications is the Patent Act itself. The only provision in the Patent Act upon which the plaintiff has attempted to found the claims for relief contemplated by paragraphs 11 to 17 is section 45. In my view, those paragraphs must be struck out unless section 45 confers on the plaintiff a right to seek the relief contemplated thereby in this Court.\nIn contending that s. 21 conferred upon the appellant the right to the relief which was sought by the amended statement of claim, reference was made by counsel to the case of Hutchins Car Roofing Company and Frame v. Burnett[4] . That was an application to stay proceedings before the Exchequer Court respecting conflicting applications for a patent. The plaintiff in those proceedings had sued for a declaration that the plaintiff Frame was the first and true inventor and for an order requiring the issue of letters patent to the plaintiffs. The defendant sought a stay, alleging that he had already named an arbitrator so that the issue of conflict might be determined by arbitration in accordance with s. 20 of the Patent Act, R.S.C. 1906, c. 69.\nThat section, which was headed \"CONFLICTING APPLICATIONS\", provided that in the case of conflicting applications for any patent the same should be submitted to the arbitration of three skilled persons, two to be chosen by the applicants and one to be chosen by the Commissioner. A majority decision of the arbitrators was declared final. No reference was made in this section to the Exchequer Court.\nThe predecessor of this section is to be found in s. 43 of Chapter 26, 35 Vict. (1872). That section preceded the enactment, in s. 4 of Chapter 26, 54-55 Vict. (1891), of the section which is now s. 21 of the Exchequer Court Act.\nThe application for a stay was refused, Cassels J. holding that the Exchequer Court had jurisdiction under s. 23 of the Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C. 1906, c. 140, (the predecessor of the present s. 21), to determine the matter notwithstanding the proceedings pending for arbitration under the Patent Act.\nWhen an appeal was launched to this Court[5] , the plaintiffs sought to quash the appeal on the grounds of lack of jurisdiction. It was held an appeal would lie. There is no report of any later decision by this Court on the merits.\nA few years after the decision of Cassels J., and, presumably, to meet the difficulty created by the possible existence of two distinct procedures for dealing with conflicting applications for a patent, Parliament, when it enacted the Patent Act, Chapter 23, Statutes of Canada 1923, added to s. 22 (formerly s. 20, R.S.C. 1906, c. 69) a new subs. (7), which provided as follows:\n(7) If prior to such time as may be fixed by the Commissioner for the appointment of arbitrators or allowed by him to enable the conflicting applicants to unite in appointing arbitrators, any one of the conflicting applicants takes proceedings in the Exchequer Court for the determination of the conflict, no further proceedings shall be taken thereon under this section, and the said Court shall have exclusive jurisdiction in the premises; but no such proceedings shall be taken in the Exchequer Court after the expiration of such time.\nThis subsection recognized the jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court with respect to conflicting applications for patents, but limited the period during which it might be exercised. It continued in effect as subs. (7) of s. 22 of the Patent Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 150.\nIn 1932 s. 22 was repealed. The procedure by way of arbitration was replaced by the method of dealing with conflicting applications which now appears in s. 45 of the present Act. The change was effected by Chapter 21, Statutes of Canada 1932.\nThe important point is, however, that, since 1923, Parliament has made it clear in the provisions of the various Patent Acts that, notwithstanding the jurisdiction conferred by the Exchequer Court Act upon the Exchequer Court to deal with conflicting patent applications, the right to seek redress in that Court by an applicant is governed and limited by the provisions of the Patent Act respecting conflicting applications. The conclusion which I draw from the legislative history of the provisions of the Patent Act respecting conflicting applications is that, although jurisdiction is conferred upon the Exchequer Court by s. 21 of the Exchequer Court Act in cases of conflicting applications for a patent, the right of a party involved in such a conflict to attack the patent application of another party is governed by s. 45 and such party is restricted to such rights as are conferred by that section. As previously stated, it is the opinion of this Court that proceedings under subs. (8) of that section are limited to the subject matter of the claims found to be in conflict by the Commissioner.\nIn my opinion, therefore, this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Smart & Biggar, Ottawa.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Gowling, MacTavish, Osborne & Henderson, Ottawa.\n[1] [1965] 2 Ex.

Gauthier (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1965: October 27, 28; 1966: January 25.\nPresent: Fauteux, Abbott, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nInsurance\u2014Fire\u2014Hotel destroyed by fire\u2014Risks insured by different insurers\u2014Misdescription and concealment of fact\u2014Whether policies invalid\u2014Civil Code, arts. 2485, 2572.\nFollowing a fire which destroyed his hotel, the plaintiff sued the ten insurance companies from whom he had obtained fire insurance policies. The property insured was described in the policies as a hotel in use having not more than twenty rooms, with a permit to sell alcoholic beverages. At the time of the fire, and for some time prior, the hotel had lost its permit and had been unoccupied. Some of the policies had been issued through C, an insurance broker, and the two policies which are in issue in this appeal were obtained through G, also an insurance broker. The defence was, inter alia, that the plaintiff had wrongly described the premises as a hotel in use and licensed. The action was maintained by the trial judge. The Court of Appeal, by a majority judgment, held that the plaintiff was entitled to recover under the policies, as it found that the knowledge of C, through whom most of the policies had been obtained, that the premises were not as described in the policies was the knowledge of the insurers. Two judges dissented as to the liability of the two appellant companies, who were granted leave to appeal to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nAt all relevant times, C was familiar with the condition of the property, but as to G this was not so. The plaintiff failed to disclose to G that the hotel's licence had been cancelled or suspended and that the hotel was vacant. The description of the property both as to the occupation and the possession of a liquor licence was material to an appreciation of the risk. The insurer was entitled to take both of these factors into account when determining the premium to be charged or in deciding whether or not the risk would be assumed. The failure to disclose that the hotel had lost its licence was fatal to the validity of the policies in issue. The failure to disclose also that the building was unoccupied at the time the policy was issued and had continued so until the fire occurred was equally fatal. These two conditions were inseparable.\nAssurance\u2014Incendie\u2014H\u00f4tel d\u00e9truit par le feu\u2014Risques assur\u00e9s par diff\u00e9rents assureurs\u2014Fausse description et dissimulation de fait\u2014Les polices sont-elles invalides\u2014Code Civil, arts. 2485, 2572.\nA la suite d'un feu qui d\u00e9truisit son h\u00f4tel, le demandeur a poursuivi les dix compagnies d'assurances de qui il avait obtenu des polices d'assurances contre le feu. La propri\u00e9t\u00e9 assur\u00e9e \u00e9tait d\u00e9crite dans les polices comme \u00e9tant un h\u00f4tel en usage n'ayant pas plus de vingt chambres, avec licence pour vendre des boissons alcooliques. Lors du feu, et depuis quelque temps, l'h\u00f4tel avait perdu sa licence et \u00e9tait inoccup\u00e9. Quelques-unes des polices avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mises par l'entremise de C, un agent d'assurances, et les deux polices dont il est question dans cet appel avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenues par l'entremise de G, un autre agent d'assurances. La d\u00e9fense a plaid\u00e9, inter alia, que le demandeur avait faussement d\u00e9crit la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant un h\u00f4tel en usage et ayant une licence. L'action a \u00e9t\u00e9 maintenue par le Juge au proc\u00e8s. La Cour d'Appel, par un jugement majoritaire, a jug\u00e9 que le demandeur avait droit de recouvrement en vertu des polices. Elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la connaissance imput\u00e9e \u00e0 C, par l'entremise duquel la majorit\u00e9 des polices avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenues, que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 n'\u00e9tait pas telle que d\u00e9crite dans les polices, \u00e9tait la connaissance m\u00eame des assureurs. Deux Juges ont enregistr\u00e9 une dissidence quant \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 des deux compagnies appelantes, qui ont obtenu la permission d'en appeler devant cette Cour.\nArr\u00eat: L'appel doit \u00eatre maintenu.\nDurant la p\u00e9riode critique, C \u00e9tait au courant de la situation de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, mais il n'en \u00e9tait pas ainsi quant \u00e0 G. Le demandeur \u00e9tait en d\u00e9faut de ne pas avoir indiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 G que la licence de l'h\u00f4tel avait \u00e9t\u00e9 annul\u00e9e ou suspendue et que l'h\u00f4tel \u00e9tait vacant. La description de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 quant \u00e0 l'occupation et quant \u00e0 la possession d'une licence de boissons \u00e9tait un fait important dans l'appr\u00e9ciation du risque. L'assureur avait droit de tenir compte de ces deux facteurs pour d\u00e9terminer le taux qu'il devait exiger ou pour d\u00e9cider s'il devait ou non assumer le risque. Le d\u00e9faut d'indiquer que l'h\u00f4tel avait perdu sa licence \u00e9tait fatal \u00e0 la validit\u00e9 des polices en question. Le d\u00e9faut d'indiquer aussi que le b\u00e2timent \u00e9tait inoccup\u00e9 lorsque la police a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mise et a continu\u00e9 dans cette situation jusqu'au temps du feu \u00e9tait \u00e9galement fatal. Ces deux conditions \u00e9taient ins\u00e9parables.\nAPPELS d'un jugement de la Cour du banc de la reine, province de Qu\u00e9bec[1], rejetant un appel d'un jugement du Juge Ouimet. Appel maintenu.\nAPPEALS from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec[2], dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Ouimet J. Appeal allowed.\nJohn A. Nolan, Q.C., and Jerome C. Smythe, for the defendants, appellants.\nJean Badeaux, Q.C., Claude Beno\u00eet and Jacqueline Beaupr\u00e9, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nABBOTT J.:\u2014The present appeals, by leave, are from two majority judgments of the Court of Queen's Bench1, rendered March 19, 1964, affirming two judgments of the Superior Court which maintained respondent's actions against the two appellants respectively.\nRespondent originally instituted ten separate actions, against ten insurance companies, claiming indemnity under ten fire insurance policies, with respect to the loss by fire, on December 4, 1957, of a hotel property known as H\u00f4tel Laval, situated at Lavaltrie, a small town on the North Shore of the St. Lawrence River between Montreal and Trois-Rivi\u00e8res. All ten actions were joined for trial and all were maintained by the learned trial judge.\nAppeals were taken by nine of the defendant companies and all appeals were unsuccessful. Montgomery and Owen JJ. dissented as to the liability of the two appellants, who applied for and were granted leave to appeal to this Court. The material facts are fully set out in the judgments below and it is unnecessary to repeat them here at any length. In their essential details they are not now in dispute.\nThe hotel property at Lavaltrie, the object of the insurance, was originally acquired by respondent in 1954. In July 1957 following a series of transfers, the property was owned by one Marcel Lapierre. Respondent was an hypothecary creditor, and the original deed of sale from him contained a \"dation en paiement\" clause. At that time the fire insurance coverage on the property had been cancelled for non-payment of premiums. During the month of July 1957, the respondent, through a broker Jean-Marie Corbeil, obtained ten fire insurance policies on the hotel from ten different companies. Of these policies, seven were subsequently cancelled.\nOn August 28, 1957, the said Marcel Lapierre was declared a bankrupt and one Yvan Mass\u00e9 named as trustee. The trustee operated the hotel for a short time, but on September 27, 1957, the licence to sell alcoholic beverages was cancelled by the Quebec Liquor Board and thereafter the hotel ceased to operate and became vacant.\nBy judgment dated November 7, 1957, effect was given to the \"dation en paiement\" clause above referred to, and the respondent Gauthier was declared to be the owner of the property with retroactive effect.\nGauthier did not wish to operate the hotel however, and desired to sell it. He testified that when he visited the hotel on November 10, 1957, it was closed and that on the date of the fire, December 4, 1957, it was not operating. On November 10, 1957, Gauthier appointed a caretaker, one Roger Miron, the owner and operator of a garage situated immediately to the west of the hotel property. This garage was between the hotel and Miron's residence. Miron testified that from the date of his appointment to the date of the fire he visited the hotel two or three times daily and attended to the operation of the heating system. The hotel was vacant at that time and continued to be unoccupied until the date of the fire. On October 3, 1957, Corbeil was notified, on behalf of the insurance companies concerned, that seven of the policies above referred to were cancelled. On being advised of this, Gauthier then instructed Corbeil to obtain other insurance to replace the cancelled policies. At all relevant times Corbeil was familiar with the condition of the property, and knew that it was unoccupied and that the liquor licence had been cancelled. Corbeil testified he advised respondent that he was doubtful if he would be able to obtain the insurance requested, to which respondent replied \"J'ai mon agent Monsieur Girardin\" and Corbeil asked that Girardin communicate with him.\nIn fact three additional policies were obtained through Corbeil (which are not the policies in issue on this appeal) and four policies\u2014two of which are the policies in issue here\u2014were obtained through the agent Maurice Girardin. These policies were issued as of November 21, 1957. The hotel property was destroyed by fire on December 4, 1957.\nGirardin testified that he was an insurance broker, that he knew the respondent Gauthier whom he had first met when he had insured Gauthier's private residence in Montreal. He said that in November 1957 Gauthier called him and asked him to insure part of the H\u00f4tel Laval. Gauthier told Girardin that he had an insurance broker named Corbeil, but that the latter could not get coverage for the full amount. Gauthier requested Girardin to call Corbeil and ask him if he, Girardin, could take the balance.\nGirardin called Corbeil and asked for information as to the construction of the hotel. He says that he knew nothing else at the time as to the condition of the hotel or its circumstances, but since he knew that respondent had spoken to Corbeil, he issued policies in terms similar to those contained in the policies previously issued.\nGirardin obtained the two policies which are the subject of the present appeals. They were issued as of November 21, 1957, and upon receipt thereof, Girardin delivered them to respondent. The object of the insurance is described in the two policies as follows:\nThe Canadian Home Assurance Company\u2014Policy No. 521743\nSur le B\u00e2timent seulement de l'immeuble \u00e0 3 \u00e9tages construit en bois avec toiture en 1re classe ainsi que ses annexes contigu\u00ebs et communicantes par l'int\u00e9rieur occup\u00e9es aux m\u00eames fins et qui ne sont pas sp\u00e9cialement assur\u00e9es ou s\u00e9par\u00e9es par un mur complet ou un espace, les fondations, les garnitures et am\u00e9nagements permanents lesquels y sont assujettis en forment partie et appartiennent au propri\u00e9taire de l'immeuble, les cl\u00f4tures, les fresques et les glaces, seulement lorsque ledit b\u00e2timent n'est occup\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 l'usage de H\u00f4tel connu sous le nom H\u00f4tel Laval avec pas plus de 20 chambres, licence pour boissons alcooliques et situ\u00e9 \u00e0 Paroisse Lavaltrie, Ct\u00e9. Berthier, Province de Qu\u00e9bec.\n(emphasis added).\nLloyd's of London\u2014Policy No. CH 15507\nOn Building and Contents, as per wording attached to Warranty Company's Policy.\nThe warranty company referred to is the appellant, Canadian Home Assurance Company.\nGirardin says that when he delivered the policies to respondent he checked the descriptions therein against the descriptions in the policies already held by respondent. He pointed out to respondent that the policies stated:\nH\u00f4tel Laval, si je me rappelle bien, avec des chambres et avec permis de la Commission des Liqueurs.\nHe says that he asked respondent if that was correct, to which respondent replied:\nBien, avec permis, je vais l'avoir d'ici quelques jours.\nGirardin states that he then told respondent:\nS'il n'avait pas de permis, que l'assurance n'entre pas en force\u2014il faut que \u00e7a suive la police.\nHe was told nothing further by respondent concerning the hotel when he delivered the policies.\nAt the time Girardin obtained the policies, he did not know that any previous policies on the hotel had been cancelled, nor did he know whether or not the owner of the hotel held a liquor permit.\nGirardin's evidence as to these matters was not denied by respondent, and I am satisfied that respondent and Corbeil failed to disclose to Girardin, when applying for insurance, that the hotel's licence had been cancelled or suspended and that the hotel was vacant.\nThe courts are frequently called upon to consider an insurer's defence based upon misdescription of, or failure to disclose information respecting the object of the insurance. Aside from certain well established general principles, most cases turn upon the circumstances in each case and the wording of the particular policy.\nOne of the general principles to which I have referred was stated by Newcombe J. in Sun Insurance Office of London, England v. Roy[3], when speaking for the Court he said:\nThere are many cases referred to in the factums, and more in the books, with regard to the effect of words forming part of the description in a fire policy and intended to describe, sometimes in the present and sometimes in the future tense, the user of the premises, but there is none inconsistent with the view, the reasonableness of which commends itself, that, where the property is described as occupied in a particular manner, and occupation in that manner is material to the risk, the insurance is not attached to the risk if the premises, at the date of the contract, be not, and have not subsequently been, so occupied.\nThat statement has been quoted with approval by the Court of Queen's Bench in Dumais v. Laurentian Insurance Co.[4] and Ice Supply Co. Ltd. v. Guardian Assurance Co.[5].\nAppellants principal defence to the actions against them was that the risk was not properly described in accordance with arts. 2485 and 2572 of the Civil Code which read:\nArticle 2485\nThe insured is obliged to represent to the insurer fully and fairly every fact which shows the nature and extent of the risk, and which may prevent the undertaking of it, or affect the rate of premium.\nArticle 2572\nIt is an implied warranty on the part of the insured that his description of the object of the insurance shall be such as to show truly under what class of risk it falls according to the proposals and conditions of the policy. Appellants submitted (1) that what was intended to be insured was clearly a licensed and operating hotel, not an unoccupied and unlicensed building and (2) that there was fundamental error as to the object of the insurance with the effect that no contracts of insurance ever existed.\nThe significant words in the description of the object insured, as contained in the policies, are these,\n\u2026seulement lorsque ledit b\u00e2timent n'est occup\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 l'usage de H\u00f4tel connu sous le nom H\u00f4tel Laval avec pas plus de 20 chambres, licence pour boissons alcooliques et situ\u00e9 \u00e0 Paroisse Lavaltrie, Ct\u00e9 Berthier, Province de Qu\u00e9bec.\nThe majority in the Court below were of opinion that the words \"occup\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 l'usage de H\u00f4tel\" in this context were descriptive only, and meant a building furnished and equipped in such a fashion as to permit it to be used only as a hotel. With respect I cannot agree with that interpretation. In my opinion, the description of the property both as to occupation and the possession of a liquor licence was material to an appreciation of the risk. There is evidence to that effect in the record. The insurer is entitled to take both of these factors into account, when determining the premium to be charged, or in deciding whether or not he will assume the risk.\nI share the view expressed by Montgomery J. that the failure to disclose that the hotel had lost its licence was fatal to the validity of the policies in issue here. I am also of opinion that the failure to disclose that the building was unoccupied at the time the policy was issued and had continued so until the fire occurred is equally fatal. In my view these two conditions are inseparable.\nIn the result I would allow both appeals and dismiss both actions with costs throughout.\nAppeals allowed with costs.\nAttorneys for the defendants, appellants: O'Brien, Home, Hall, Nolan & Saunders, Montreal.\nAttorneys for the plaintiff, respondent: Turgeon & Beaupr\u00e9, Montreal.\n[1] [1964] Que.

Craig Limited Respondent.\n1965: December 13, 14, 15; 1966: January 25.\nPresent: Abbott, Judson, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nPatents\u2014Compulsory licence\u2014Preparation or production of medicine\u2014Exchequer Court affirmed granting of licence by Commissioner of Patents\u2014Royalty as fixed by Commissioner changed by Exchequer Court\u2014Patent Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 203, s. 41(3)\nPursuant to s. 41(3) of the Patent Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 203, the Commissioner of Patents granted to the respondent a licence to use for the purpose of the preparation or production of medicine an invention patented by the appellant and which related to a substance sold by it under the trade name Librium. The Commissioner of Patents fixed the royalty to be paid by the respondent at 15 per cent of respondent's net selling price of the bulk active material. The Exchequer Court affirmed the Commissioner's decision to grant the licence but changed the royalty fixed by the Commissioner to a royalty of 15 per cent of the respondent's net selling price of the patented drug in dosage form. The appellant appealed to this Court from that judgment and the respondent cross-appealed with regard to the amount of the royalty. At the conclusion of the argument on behalf of the appellant, the Court invited counsel for the respondent to argue only the cross-appeal asking that the royalty as fixed by the Commissioner should be restored.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed and the cross-appeal allowed; the royalty as fixed by the Commissioner should be restored.\nThe purpose of s. 41(3) of the Patent Act is clear. No absolute monopoly can be obtained in a process for the production of food or medicine. In the public interest there should be competition in the production and marketing of such products produced by a patented process in order that they might be \"available to the public at the lowest possible price consistent with giving to the inventor due reward for the research leading to the invention\". Since the royalty payable by a licensee for using a patented process is one of his costs of production, there is an obvious justification, in cases where a percentage royalty is decided upon, for using as a base, the sale price of the bulk material rather than a base which reflects a variety of packaging, distribution, promotion, sales and other like expenses. The Commissioner was entitled to use the base which he did in this case in establishing the royalty. The appellant has failed to discharge the burden which was upon it of establishing that the Commissioner acted on a wrong principle or that on the evidence his decision was manifestly wrong. Brevets\u2014Licence forc\u00e9e\u2014Pr\u00e9paration ou production de m\u00e9dicaments\u2014La Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier confirmant la licence accord\u00e9e par le Commissaire des Brevets\u2014Redevance fix\u00e9e par le Commissaire \u00e9tant chang\u00e9e par la Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier\u2014Loi sur les Brevets, S.R.C. 1952, c. 203, art. 41(3).\nEn vertu de l'art. 41(3) de la Loi sur les Brevets, S.R.C. 1952, c. 203, le Commissaire des Brevets a accord\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e une licence pour utiliser, pour les fins de la pr\u00e9paration ou production de m\u00e9dicaments, une invention brevet\u00e9e par l'appelante et qui couvrait une substance vendue par elle sous la marque de commerce Librium. Le Commissaire des Brevets a fix\u00e9 la redevance devant \u00eatre pay\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 15 pour-cent du prix net de vente par l'intim\u00e9e de la substance en gros. La Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier a confirm\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision du Commissaire d'accorder la licence mais a chang\u00e9 la redevance fix\u00e9e par le Commissaire \u00e0 une redevance de 15 pour-cent du prix net de vente par l'intim\u00e9e de la drogue brevet\u00e9e sous forme de dose. L'appellante en a appel\u00e9 de ce jugement devant cette Cour et l'intim\u00e9e a port\u00e9 un contre-appel relativement au montant de la redevance. Lorsque l'appelante eut termin\u00e9 sa plaidoirie, la Cour a invit\u00e9 l'avocat de l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 ne faire porter son argument que sur le contre-appel par lequel elle demandait que la redevance telle que fix\u00e9e par le Commissaire soit r\u00e9tablie.\nArr\u00eat: L'appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 et le contre-appel maintenu; la redevance telle que fix\u00e9e par le Commissaire doit \u00eatre r\u00e9tablie.\nLe but de l'art. 41(3) de la Loi sur les Brevets est clair. Aucun monopole absolu ne peut \u00eatre obtenu pour des proc\u00e9d\u00e9s visant \u00e0 la production d'aliments ou de m\u00e9dicaments. Il est de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public qu'il y ait une concurrence dans la production et le service commercial de ces produits provenant d'un proc\u00e9d\u00e9 brevet\u00e9 afin qu'ils soient \u00ab accessibles au public au plus bas prix possible, tout en accordant \u00e0 l'inventeur une juste r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration pour les recherches qui ont conduit \u00e0 l'invention \u00bb. Puisque la redevance payable par un d\u00e9tenteur de licence pour utiliser un proc\u00e9d\u00e9 brevet\u00e9 fait partie de ses frais de production, il y a une justification \u00e9vidente, dans les cas o\u00f9 on se sert d'une redevance par pourcentage, d'utiliser comme base le prix de vente du mat\u00e9riel en gros plut\u00f4t qu'une base qui refl\u00e9terait une vari\u00e9t\u00e9 de d\u00e9penses d'empaquetage, de distribution, de promotion, de vente et autres. Le Commissaire \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9 de se servir de la base dont il s'est servi dans ce cas pour \u00e9tablir la redevance. L'appelante n'a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 se lib\u00e9rer du fardeau qui lui incombait d'\u00e9tablir que le Commissaire avait agi selon un principe erron\u00e9 ou que sa d\u00e9cision avait \u00e9t\u00e9 manifestement erron\u00e9e en regard de la preuve.\nAPPEL et CONTRE-APPEL d'un jugement du Pr\u00e9sident Jackett de la Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier du Canada[1], maintenant en partie une d\u00e9cision du Commissaire des Brevets. Appel rejet\u00e9 et contre-appel maintenu.\nAPPEAL and CROSS-APPEAL from a judgment of Jackett P. of the Exchequer Court of Canada[2], allowing in part an appeal from a decision of the Commissioner of Patents. Appeal dismissed and cross-appeal allowed. R. G. McClenahan and C. R. Carson, for the appellant.\nI Goldsmith, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nABBOTT J.:\u2014This appeal is from a judgment of the President of the Exchequer Court[3] allowing in part an appeal by the present appellant from a decision of the Commissioner of Patents, pursuant to s. 41 (3) of the Patent Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 203, as amended, which had granted to respondent a licence to use for the purpose of the preparation or production of medicine, the invention patented by Canadian Patent No. 612,497 held by appellant. This patent is entitled \"1, 4 Benzodiazepine 4-Oxides and Process for the Manufacture Thereof\". It relates to a substance, the chemical designation for which is 2-Methylamino-5-phenyl-7-chloro-3H-1, 4 benzo-diazepine 4-oxide, the generic name for which is Chlordiazepoxide, and which is sold by appellant under the registered trade name \"Librium\".\nSection 41 (3) of the Patent Act provides:\nIn the case of any patent for an invention intended for or capable of being used for the preparation or production of food or medicine, the Commissioner shall, unless he sees good reason to the contrary, grant to any person applying for the same, a licence limited to the use of the invention for the purposes of the preparation or production of food or medicine but not otherwise; and, in settling the terms of such licence and fixing the amount of royalty or other consideration payable the Commissioner shall have regard to the desirability of making the food or medicine available to the public at the lowest possible price consistent with giving to the inventor due reward for the research leading to the invention.\nThe President of the Exchequer Court affirmed the Commissioner's decision to grant the licence, but varied the terms as fixed by him and allowed the appeal with respect to the question of royalty, changing the royalty as fixed by the Commissioner at 15 per cent of respondent's net selling price of the bulk active material, to a royalty of 15 per cent of the respondent's net selling price of the patented drug in dosage form to persons with whom respondent is dealing at arm's length. Save as aforesaid the appeal was dismissed and appellant was ordered to pay to respondent 90 per cent of the costs of the appeal.\nThe appellant appealed to this Court from that judgment and respondent cross appealed with regard only to the amount of the royalty fixed by Jackett P. It might be noted here in passing, that the patent in issue on this appeal is the same patent which was before this Court in Hoffman-Laroche Ltd. v. Delmar Chemical Ltd.[4] which dismissed an appeal by the present appellant from a judgment of the Exchequer Court which had confirmed a decision of the Commissioner granting, under s. 41 (3) to the respondent in that case, a licence to use the invention for the purposes of the preparation or production of medicine. The general principles to be followed by the Commissioner in deciding whether a licence should be granted under the said section, were dealt with by this Court in the Delmar case and in an earlier decision, Parke, Davis & Company v. Fine Chemicals of Canada Limited[5].\nBefore both the Exchequer Court and this Court, appellant asked for an order declaring the licence granted to the respondent by the Commissioner of Patents to be null and void. In the alternative appellant asked that the cross-appeal on the question of royalty be dismissed and that the royalty to be paid by respondent be fixed at the sum of $3,528.37 per kilogram of chlordiazepoxide made and sold by respondent.\nAt the conclusion of the argument on behalf of appellant, counsel for respondent was informed that the Court did not need to hear him on the main appeal either as to the finding that a licence should issue or as to the adequacy of the royalty. He was invited therefore to argue only the cross-appeal asking that the royalty as fixed by the Commissioner should be restored.\nUnder s. 41 (3), the decision both as to whether a licence should issue, and if so the royalty to be paid, was one for the Commissioner to make. While an appeal lies from that decision, in order to succeed it is for the appellant to show that the Commissioner acted on a wrong principle or that, on the evidence, the decision was manifestly wrong. Parke, Davis & Company v. Fine Chemicals Limited and Hoffman-Laroche Ltd. v. Delmar Chemical Ltd., supra, and The King v. Irving Air Chute Inc.[6]. It was not suggested before this Court that the evidence before the Commissioner in this case was inadequate to enable him intelli gently to arrive at a royalty which would give due weight to all the relevant considerations.\nThe Commissioner in his reasons dealt with the question of royalty as follows:\nThe next question to be determined is that of royalty. The patentee brought, as a witness to the hearing, a Chartered Accountant who has an extensive experience in business practices and who has a thorough knowledge of the pharmaceutical industry. He gave us a detailed explanation of the way the pharmaceutical industry figures out what part of each sales dollar goes to the different items of expenditure that have to be accounted for before profits can be determined.\nThe purpose was to arrive at a royalty figure. However, the royalty arrived at through his method would amount to the fantastic sum of three thousand five hundred and twenty-eight dollars per kilo of bulk active material which costs approximately one hundred and fifty dollars to make. Of course that was based on the cost of the complete and sustained research program undertaken by the patentee company, the overhead, return on capital invested, depreciation, sponsoring, advertising, and keeping the physicians' interest in the drug, all figured out on the sales of the product when capsuled, sealed and labelled, ready for patient's consumption.\nIn all these considerations the patentee forgets that I am dealing with a patent covering a process. He has no exclusive right to the bulk active material per se, except when made by the particular process of the patent. Anyone is free to make and sell the product if he can develop a different process or somehow obtain it legally. I am therefore concerned with the process only. Much less has he any exclusivity on the finished material in dosage form, packaged and labelled. This is outside the scope of the patent and it is immaterial to me. Reference can be made to the case of Fine Chemicals Limited v. Parke, Davis & Co. where I followed the same reasoning, (1957, Vol. 16 Fox Patent cases p. 38). The Commissioner's decision was affirmed in the Exchequer Court, (1957, Vol. 18 Fox Patent cases p. 173) and in the Supreme Court (1959, Vol. 18 Fox Patent cases p. 125). The principle I have established of fixing the royalty on the sale price of the bulk material has not been disturbed by the courts. In the Supreme Court, Mr.Justice Martland said at page 134 (Fox) \"The Royalty as fixed is, therefore, to be determined upon the wholesale price and has no relationship to the ultimate selling price of the medicine to the consumer.\" He went on to question the adequacy of the royalty but not the principle.\nI pause here, in the recital of those reasons to emphasize that the passage quoted from the reasons for judgment of Martland J. in the case cited by the Commissioner was merely a description of the method in fact adopted by the Commissioner for the determination of the royalty in that case. The Commissioner is however correct in stating that this Court did not disapprove of the method as constituting an improper means of the determination of royalty. Such a basis of determination is certainly a permissible basis but it was not necessarily the only one open to the Commissioner, and on this point I adopt the following statement of Rand J. in the Irving Air Chute case, supra, at p. 625:\nI am unable to follow either the Commissioner or the President of the Exchequer Court in the preliminary ascertainment of a rate or percentage as something in some degree absolute which will thereafter be applied to a subsequently ascertained base money value. What the inventor is to receive is a sum of money related to the invention used; and the base value, whether cost or selling price of either the whole or part of the apparatus embodying the invention, is obviously bound up with the rate or percentage to be used. Base values as in practice adopted are limited in number and can be accurately ascertained; and being fixed upon, the important question, to which the evidential matters are relevant, becomes that of the highly variable percentage.\nI resume the quotation from the Commissioner's reasons:\nAlthough the product per se is not actually patented the royalty payments have to be calculated on the amount of product made by the process, because it would be next to impossible to assess the value of a process except on the basis of the extent of its use to make a product which in turn can be evaluated in terms of dollars and cents.\nIn the case at hand the patentee has arrived in his calculations at a royalty of $3,528.37 per kilo but this figure includes all the irrelevant factors that I have in the past refused to consider and which are not part of what is covered by the patent.\n***\nOn the basis of past experience and upon considering the wide acceptance of the product, I will fix the royalty at 15% of the net selling price of the bulk active material made by the licensee and sold to others, or should the licensee process all of its production for sale as finished medicine ready for patients consumption, the royalty payments should be based on what would be a fair selling price of the bulk material to others.\nThe learned President after summarising the arguments of counsel for appellant with reference to royalty said this:\nIn this case, the only attack on the Commissioner's decision with reference to royalty is that it is too low. It has not been suggested that it is higher than it should be. As I see the problem, therefore, the only question is whether the royalty fixed is commensurate with the maintenance of research incentive and the importance of both process and substance.\nAfter discussing various considerations to be taken into consideration in fixing a royalty, the President made this finding:\nI have come to the conclusion that the Commissioner fell into error in thinking that \"the finished material in dosage form, packaged and labelled\" was \"outside the scope of the patent\" and \"immaterial\" to him. On the contrary, the drug in the dosage form, if it was made in accordance with the patented process, is just as much the subject matter of the patentee's monopoly as it is when it is sold in bulk. It is precisely the same product as it is when it is in bulk except that it has been packaged so as to be in the form in which it has value as a merchantable commodity. He then proceeded to fix the royalty payable at 15 per cent of the licensee's selling price when it sells the patented drug in dosage form. The President in the passage just quoted was referring of course to the statement made by the Commissioner in his reasons that:\nIn all these considerations the patentee forgets that I am dealing with a patent covering a process. He has no exclusive right to the bulk active material per se, except when made by the particular process of the patent. Anyone is free to make and sell the product if he can develop a different process or somehow obtain it legally. I am therefore concerned with the process only. Much less has he any exclusivity on the finished material in dosage form, packaged and labelled. This is outside the scope of the patent and it is immaterial to me.\nWith respect I am unable to agree with the conclusion reached by the learned President.\nAs Martland J. pointed out in the Parke, Davis case, supra, at p. 228, the monopoly in a process patent for the production or preparation of food or medicine is considerably restricted in scope and the royalty allowed should be commensurate with the maintenance of research incentive and the importance of both process and substance. Such royalty should also be commensurate with the desirability of making food or medicine available to the public at the lowest possible price consistent with giving to the inventor\u2014not the patentee\u2014reward for the research leading to the invention.\nIn my view the purpose of s. 41 (3) is clear. Shortly stated it is this. No absolute monopoly can be obtained in a process for the production of food or medicine. On the contrary Parliament intended that, in the public interest, there should be competition in the production and marketing of such products produced by a patented process, in order that as the section states, they may be \"available to the public at the lowest possible price consistent with giving to the inventor due reward for the research leading to the invention\".\nThe royalty payable by a licensee for using a patented process is one of his costs of production. That being so there is an obvious justification, in cases where a percentage royalty is decided upon, for using as a base, the sale price of the bulk material produced by the patented process, rather than a base which reflects a variety of packaging, distribution, promotional, sales and other like expenses. In my opinion on the evidence before him, the Commissioner was entitled to use the base which he did in establishing the royalty.\nAs I have already stated, it is well established that the appellant could succeed on its appeal only if it were able to establish that the Commissioner acted on a wrong principle, or that on the evidence his decision was manifestly wrong. In my opinion, the appellant failed to discharge that burden, and the royalty as fixed by the Commissioner should not have been interfered with.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs here and below, allow the cross-appeal with costs, restore the royalty as fixed by the Commissioner of Patents and order that the licence be amended accordingly.\nAppeal dismissed and cross-appeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Gowling, MacTavish, Osborne & Henderson, Ottawa.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Duncan, Goldsmith & Caswell, Toronto.\n[1] [1965] 2 Ex.

In 1957, the appellant obtained a separation from her husband, the mis-en-cause, and custody of their two children. The parties were later divorced. Subsequently, the husband filed two petitions before the Superior Court to obtain the custody of the children. The first one was dismissed, and the second one was adjourned sine die and was still pending at the time of the present proceedings. In November 1962, the husband signed a petition before a judge of the Social Welfare Court, seeking the holding of an inquiry in respect of one of the children, pursuant to s. 15 of the Youth Protection Act, R.S.Q. 1941, c. 38 [now R.S.Q. 1964, c. 220]. The first allegation contained in the petition was a repetition of the wording of the first sentence of s. 15(1) of the Act. The second allegation recited that the boy was being kept away from his father, that he was being prejudiced against his father, and that all of this \"may lead to serious character disturbances\". The Court ordered a notice to be served on the appellant advising her that an inquiry would be held before a judge of the Social Welfare Court. The appellant then obtained from the Superior Court the issuance of a writ of prohibition which was later declared peremptory. The Social Welfare Court and the Attorney General, the latter pursuant to the right conferred upon him by art. 1210 of the Code of Civil Procedure, appealed to the Court of Appeal where the writ of prohibition was quashed. The appellant was granted leave to appeal to this Court.\nHeld (Martland and Hall JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Fauteux, Abbott and Judson JJ.: The proposition that a child, of whom the custody has been determined by the Superior Court, is under the protection of that Court and does not need to be protected by the Social Welfare Court, is untenable.\nThe unalterable consequences of res judicata do not attach to a judgment of the Superior Court awarding the custody of children. The jurisdiction of the Social Welfare Court to entrust the custody of the children to somebody else than the person to whom it had been entrusted by the Superior Court is to be ascertained by a reference to the terms of the Youth Protection Act\u2014the validity of which was not challenged here\u2014and not by reference to the doctrine of res judicata.\nThe argument that the jurisdiction of the Courts has been completely exhausted when the husband elected to proceed by way of a petition which is still pending before the Superior Court, is also untenable. The maxim Electa una via non datur recursus ad alteram has no application in the province of Quebec. Even if it were part of the law of the province, it could not operate to prevent an inquiry under the Youth Protection Act which is not a judicial process of the nature and character of the judicial proceedings contemplated by the maxim.\nNothing has been shown and there is nothing in the Youth Protection Act supporting the proposition that the jurisdiction of a judge of the Social Welfare Court to embark upon an inquiry is subject to the limitations suggested by the appellant. An inferior Court may not be prevented from exercising the jurisdiction, conferred upon it by a valid statute, through fear that its judgment may contradict that of another Court.\nThe judge of the Social Welfare Court was given information of the nature indicated in the Youth Protection Act. The word \"information\" is not to be given the technical meaning ascribed to it in penal or criminal proceedings. Per Martland and Hall JJ., dissenting: The judge of the Social Welfare Court can only order an inquiry if he has information, which he deems serious, to the effect that the child is particularly exposed to moral or physical dangers by reason of environment or other special circumstances and for such reasons needs to be protected. In this case the judge did not have before him information to the effect that the child in question was in the conditions described in the first sentence of s. 15(1) of the Youth Protection Act, and therefore he had no legal authority to bring the child before him for an inquiry.\nJuridiction\u2014Prohibition\u2014Garde des enfants\u2014Question devant la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure\u2014La Cour de Bien-\u00catre Social est-elle supplant\u00e9e\u2014Loi de la Protection de la Jeunesse, S.R.Q. 1941, c. 38, art. 15 [maintenant S.R.Q. 1964,c. 220]\u2014Code de Proc\u00e9dure Civile, art. 1210.\nEn 1957, I'appelante et son mari, le mis-en-cause, obtinrent une s\u00e9paration de corps, et la garde de leurs deux enfants fut confi\u00e9e \u00e0 l'appelante. Un divorce a \u00e9t\u00e9 subs\u00e9quemment accord\u00e9. Par la suite, le mari a produit deux requ\u00eates devant la Cour sup\u00e9rieure pour obtenir la garde des enfants.

Appel rejet\u00e9, les Juges Martland et Hall \u00e9tant dissidents.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec[2], quashing a writ of prohibition. Appeal dismissed, Martland and Hall JJ. dissenting.\nC. A. Geoffrion, Q.C., for the appellant.\nLaurent E. B\u00e9langer, Q.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of Fauteux, Abbott and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nFAUTEUX J.:\u2014The facts of this case are simple and not in dispute. Since 1957 the appellant and the mis-en-cause, now divorced, have been litigating over the custody of their two minor children, Stephen and George. In November 1962, Keller signed a petition, supported by affidavit, before Judge J. W. Long, of the Social Welfare Court, in Montreal, in which he alleged\nI have reason to believe and I do believe that the child GEORGE KELLER under the age of eighteen years, is particularly exposed to moral and physical dangers by reasons of his environment or other special circumstances, and for such reasons needs to be protected. The boy is being kept away from the father, the boy is being prejudiced against the father, all of which may lead to serious character disturbances.\nand prayed that one of the Judges of the Court apply the provisions of s. 15 of the Youth Protection Act, as amended by 8-9 Eliz. II, c. 42, now being R.S.Q. 1964, c. 220, and conduct an inquiry as to the particular circumstances in which the child was situated. The relevant parts of the section read as follows.\n15. (1) When a child is particularly exposed to moral or physical dangers, by reason of its environment or other special circumstances, and for such reasons needs to be protected, any person in authority may bring him or have him brought before a judge. A judge may also, upon information which he deems serious, to the effect that a child is in the above described conditions, order that he be brought before him.\nWithout limiting the generality of the provisions of the preceding paragraph, children whose parents, tutors or guardians are deemed unworthy, orphans with neither father nor mother and cared for by nobody, abandoned illegitimate or adulterine children, those particularly exposed to delinquency by their environment, unmanageable children generally showing pre-delinquency traits, as well as those exhibiting serious character disturbances, may be considered as being in the conditions contemplated by the preceding paragraph.\n***\n***\nThe judge shall make an inquiry, in judicial form, into the particular circumstances in which the child is situated.\nNotice in writing of such inquiry and of the time and place when and where it will be held must be served on the father and mother or one of them, or the tutor or on those having custody of the child; the latter shall have the right to be heard and to submit any proof which the judge deems relevant.\nThe Court then ordered a notice to be served on the appellant and her son George, advising them of the inquiry, of the time and place of its holding and of the right to be heard and submit any pertinent evidence. Upon reception of this notice appellant applied to and obtained from the Superior Court the issuance of a writ of prohibition directed against the Social Welfare Court, its Judges and particularly Judge J. W. Long, and the mis-en-cause, ordering them to refrain from and discontinue all proceedings in the matter until final judgment. In support of her petition for prohibition, appellant alleged that in November 1957, the Superior Court for the District of Montreal granted her a separation from bed and board from the mis-en-cause and awarded her the custody of their two minor children, Stephen and George; that in April 1959, she obtained a Parliamentary divorce from Keller; that in March 1961, the Superior Court dismissed a petition by which the latter sought to obtain the custody of the children; and that in January 1962, the Superior Court was again seized of a similar petition by Keller and that this petition, which was never proceeded with but adjourned sine die after several postponements, was still pending before the Superior Court. Appellant submitted that in view of the above facts the Social Welfare Court had no jurisdiction whatever to reopen the case, confirm or reverse the Superior Court which had already decided the issue and which had again been and was still being seized of the matter by reason of the last mentioned petition of Keller. Appellant also contended that the Social Welfare Court and Judge J. W. Long had already exceeded their jurisdiction by accepting Keller's petition for an inquiry under the Youth Protection Act and by ordering a notice of hearing to be addressed to her.\nThe mis-en-cause did not appear and while both Judge J. W. Long and the Social Welfare Court filed an appearance only the latter contested appellant's petition. The case having been heard, the writ of prohibition was declared peremptory by a judgment of the Superior Court resting substantially on the factual and legal grounds raised in appellant's petition for prohibition.\nThe Social Welfare Court and the Attorney General of the Province, the latter pursuant to the right conferred upon him by art. 1210 of the Code of Civil Procedure, appealed from this judgment. By a unanimous decision, the Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal Side)[3] composed of Tremblay C.J., Pratte, Casey, Rinfret and Owen JJ., allowed the appeal and quashed the writ of prohibition.\nThe appellant now appeals, with leave, from this judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nThe validity of the Youth Protection Act and particularly of s. 15 has not been challenged and is not here in issue. Appellant's contention is simply that in the circumstances of this case the Judge of the Social Welfare Court should not have embarked upon the inquiry contemplated by s. 15 and that this is a question of jurisdiction. This contention is more fully stated at p. 11 of appellant's factum and textually expressed as follows:\nIn the second place, it should be borne in mind that by the Writ of Prohibition herein, the jurisdiction of the Social Welfare Court and its judges is under attack only to a limited extent, Appellant's position being simply that neither the Social Welfare Court nor any of its judges has jurisdiction to deal with the case of a child whose custody is already the subject of proceedings before the Superior Court, particularly where, as in the present case, the application to the Social Welfare Court or its judge, it is made by a party to the litigation before the Superior Court, a judgment has already been rendered by such Court awarding custody to one of the parents and a Petition is pending before the Superior Court to revise this judgment. Beyond these limits the jurisdiction of the Social Welfare Court is not under attack nor is the constitutional validity of Section 15 and following of the Youth Protection Act questioned in any way whatsoever.\nIn support of these views appellant submitted, as a first proposition, that at least one of the conditions precedent to the exercise of the jurisdiction of the Social Welfare Court does not exist in the present case. A child, it is said, of whom the custody has been determined by the Superior Court, is under the protection of that Court and does not need to be protected by the Social Welfare Court. On appellant's interpretation the words \"and for such reasons needs to be protected\" could only have been inserted in the first paragraph of s. 15 to prevent a Judge of the Social Welfare Court from proceeding in the case of a child of whom the custody has been determined by the Superior Court. I cannot agree with this interpretation. If valid, it should equally obtain in the case of children to whom the Superior Court has appointed a tutor or guardian. Yet, the second paragraph of s. 15 provides that \"children whose parents, tutors or guardians are deemed to be unworthy, \u2026may be considered as being in the conditions contemplated by the preceding paragraph\".\nAppellant then argued that neither the Social Welfare Court nor any of its Judges have jurisdiction to interfere with a judgment of the Superior Court which carries with it the force of res judicata. A judgment of the Superior Court which awards the custody of a child may be changed or modified every time the interest of the child requires it. The unalterable consequences of res judicata do not attach to a judgment of this nature. Trudel: Trait\u00e9 de droit civil du Qu\u00e9bec, vol. 2, p. 49. The inquiry in the Social Welfare Court may very well show, in certain cases, that the person, to whom the Superior Court has previously entrusted the custody of a child, has now become unworthy of it and that it should be committed to somebody else. The jurisdiction of the Social Welfare Court to do so must be ascertained by reference to the terms of the Youth Protection Act\u2014the validity of which is not challenged\u2014and not by reference to the doctrine of res judicata which, in addition and in the present hypothesis, can hardly have more virtue in the Social Welfare Court than it has in the Superior Court.\nAppellant also suggested that even assuming that both the Superior Court and the Social Welfare Court and its Judges could have jurisdiction over the case of the child here involved, such jurisdiction has been completely exhausted when mis-en-cause Keller elected to proceed by way of a petition which, continued sine die, is still pending before the Superior Court. In appellant's view this is a clear case for the application of the maxim Electa una via non datur recursus ad alteram. This maxim, which no general text of law justifies, has been borrowed from the Roman law which never formulated it in precise terms. Revue de l\u00e9gislation et jurisprudence (1866), tome 28, p. 412. Its principle is stated in Revue critique de l\u00e9gislation (1933),v. 53, p. 85:\nLe principe Electa una via 'est fond\u00e9 sur l'humanit\u00e9 et aussi sur la justice qui ne permettent pas qu'on tra\u00eene un accus\u00e9 d'une juridiction dans une autre et qu'on d\u00e9cline \u00e0 son pr\u00e9judice celle qu'on a volontairement saisie parce qu'on ne la croit peut-\u00eatre pas favorable aux demandes qu'on a form\u00e9es par devant elle'.\nThe rule is formulated in these terms in Dalloz (1955), Encyclop\u00e9die juridique, Proc\u00e9dure, tome 1, p. 55, n\u00b0 181:\nD'apr\u00e8s elle, si la victime d'une infraction peut, \u00e0 son choix, agir en r\u00e9paration devant la juridiction civile ou devant la juridiction r\u00e9pressive, son option a un caract\u00e8re irr\u00e9vocable.\nIn France, the maxim has no application in civil matters and only in criminal matters does jurisprudence take it into account. Glasson et Tissier, Pr\u00e9cis de proc\u00e9dure civile (1925), tome 1, p. 427, n\u00b0 174. Whatever be the situation in other jurisdictions, the maxim appears to have no application whatever in the Province of Quebec. In this respect, reference may be had to the provisions of s. 10 of the Criminal Code of Canada; Roy, Droit de plaider (1902), p. 7, n\u00b0 9, Ferland, Trait\u00e9 sommaire et Formulaire de proc\u00e9dure civile (1962), pp. 4-5. Even if it could be held to be part of the law in the Province, it cannot, in my opinion, operate to prevent an inquiry under the Youth Protection Act, which is not a judicial process of the nature and character of the judicial proceedings contemplated by the maxim.\nIn short, nothing has been shown and I can find nothing in the Youth Protection Act supporting the proposition that the jurisdiction of a Judge of the Social Welfare Court to embark upon an inquiry\u2014be that in the case of a child brought before him by a person in authority within the meaning of s. 1 (e) or as a result of an order of the Judge\u2014is subject to the limitations suggested by appellant, which, in essence, appear to be inspired by the fear that a custody order, conflicting or in any way different from that which was made by the Superior Court, might issue at the conclusion of the inquiry. I am in respectful agreement with Mr. Justice Casey, who delivered the judgment for the Court of Appeal, that an inferior Court may not be prevented from exercising the jurisdiction, conferred on it by a valid statute, through fear that its judgment may contradict that of another Court.\nThe only remaining point is one of which no mention is made in the reasons for judgment of the Court of Appeal or in appellant's factum where the limited extent of the attack on jurisdiction is, as shown from the quotation above, well defined. This point seems to have been mentioned for the first time at the hearing in this Court. It is said that Judge Long did not have before him information that the child involved was in the conditions described in s. 15 and, that being so, he had no legal authority to order the child before him. With deference, I am unable to agree with the premise of this proposition. The procedure set out in s. 15 is of a civil nature. I do not think that the word \"information\", in the context in which it appears, has the technical meaning ascribed to the same word, in penal or criminal proceedings, and that rules, related to the sufficiency of an information or indictment, are here relevant. The question is whether Judge Long was given information of the nature indicated in the Act. I think he was. The petition contains two allegations, sworn to before him, one of which repeats the words of the Statute. The record does not permit an assumption that Judge Long did not ask and did not obtain details pertaining to this particular case. The holding of an inquiry, under the Youth Protection Act, is, of course, a serious matter. It may very well be that the decision to embark upon an inquiry was unwise. We are concerned here with jurisdiction and not with the manner in which it was exercised. I see nothing in this Statute, specially enacted for the protection of children, which suggests that the Legislature intended that the wide authority, conferred on a Judge of the Social Welfare Court to order a child to be brought before him, should be narrowed by procedural considerations.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nThe judgment of Martland and Hall JJ. was delivered by\nMARTLAND J. (dissenting):\u2014By a judgment of the Superior Court of the Province of Quebec dated November 27, 1957, the appellant obtained a separation from her husband, Stanislav Keller (hereinafter referred to as Keller) and custody of the two children of their marriage, Stephen and George.\nOn April 28, 1959, by an act of the Parliament of Canada, she obtained a divorce from Keller.\nOn March 1, 1961, a judgment of the Superior Court dismissed a petition by Keller for revision of the earlier judgment of that Court.\nA further petition was submitted by Keller to the Superior Court on January 23, 1962, seeking custody of the two children. After several adjournments this petition was adjourned sine die on March 14, 1962.\nOn November 12, 1962, Keller signed a petition before the respondent, Honourable John W. Long, a judge of the Social Welfare Court, seeking the holding of an inquiry pursuant to s. 15 of the Youth Protection Act, R.S.Q. 1941, c. 38, as amended (now c. 220, R.S.Q. 1964), in respect of the child George Keller. As a result, a notice, dated the same day, was issued and served upon the appellant, advising her that an inquiry as to the particular circumstances in which George Keller is found would be held on November 21, 1962, before a judge of the Social Welfare Court. Upon receipt of this notice, the appellant obtained the issuance of a writ of prohibition on April 4, 1962, by a judgment of the Superior Court. Appearances were filed by the respondents, Judge Long and the Social Welfare Court, but only the latter filed a contestation. The respondent Keller did not appear. By a judgment of the Superior Court on January 22, 1964, the writ of prohibition, previously authorized, was declared peremptory.\nAn appeal was taken by the Attorney General of Quebec pursuant to the provisions of art. 1210 of the Code of Civil Procedure. This appeal was allowed by unanimous decision of the Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal side).[4] From that judgment the appellant, by leave of this Court, has appealed.\nThe question in issue before this Court is as to whether the Social Welfare Court exceeded its jurisdiction when it directed an inquiry in relation to George Keller. That issue involves a consideration of the provisions of the Youth Protection Act, which is now c. 220, R.S.Q. 1964. The references to sections in these reasons are to the sections of that Act, which are the same as the ones applicable at the relevant times, although the former numbering was slightly different.\nThe Act, as its name indicates, was enacted to provide for the protection of children particularly exposed to moral or physical dangers by reason of environment or other special circumstances. It is divided into eight divisions.\nDivision I contains the interpretation section, s. 1, the relevant portions of which are as follows:\n(c) \"judge\": a district judge, except in a territory under the jurisdiction of a Social Welfare Court, where it means a judge of such court;\n***\n(e) \"person in authority\": the father, mother, tutor and subrogate tutor of a child, rector (cur\u00e9), any school commissioner of the locality where the child is, any person designated ex-officio by the judge in a particular case, and any officer of any social organizations looking after the welfare and protection of children and who shall be officially recognized as such by the Minister;\n(f) \"child\": a boy or a girl apparently or effectively aged less than eighteen years; Division II deals with the establishment of youth protection schools.\nDivision III deals with the duties of the directors of such schools.\nDivision IV is entitled \"Admission and Sojourn of Children in Schools\" and it contains s. 15, which is the provision of the greatest importance in this case. The relevant parts of that section provide as follows:\n15. (1) When a child is particularly exposed to moral or physical dangers, by reason of its environment or other special circumstances, and for such reasons needs to be protected, any person in authority may bring him or have him brought before a judge. A judge may also, upon information which he deems serious to the effect that a child is in the above described conditions, order that he be brought before him.\nWithout limiting the generality of the provisions of the preceding paragraph, children whose parents, tutors, or guardians are deemed unworthy, orphans with neither father nor mother and cared for by nobody, abandoned, illegitimate or adulterine children, those particularly exposed to delinquency by their environment, unmanageable children generally showing pre-delinquency traits, as well as those exhibiting serious character disturbances, may be considered as being in the conditions contemplated by the preceding paragraph.\nThroughout the pendency of the case the judge, in case of urgency, may take for the benefit of the child such provisional protective measures as he may deem useful by confiding the child to any person, home, society, reception centre or institution capable of receiving him temporarily.\nThe judge may also whenever he deems it expedient, issue an order to bring or have brought before him any child whose case is pending before the Court.\nThe judge shall make an inquiry, in judicial form, into the particular circumstances in which the child is situated.\nNotice in writing of such inquiry and of the time and place when and where it will be held must be served on the father and mother or one of them, on the tutor or on those having custody of the child; the latter shall have the right to be heard and to submit any proof which the judge deems relevant.\n(2) The judge may then, according to circumstances and after consultation, if need be, with a social agency, leave the child at liberty under supervision, confide him to any person or society, recommend to the Minister that he be entrusted to a school, to a public charitable institution or to a social agency, or take any other decision in the interest of the child.\nDivision V deals with the cost of custody of children. Division VI defines various offences under the Act. Section 39(2) has some relevance to this case:\n39. (2) Whosoever, wilfully and without valid excuse, exposes a child to a serious moral or physical danger or, being responsible for such child, neglects to protect him from such danger in a manner and in circumstances not covered by the Criminal Code, is liable, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding three hundred dollars or to imprisonment not exceeding one year, or to both penalties together, in addition to the costs.\nDivision VII covers the final discharge of children and Division VIII contains miscellaneous provisions.\nUnder the terms of this Act a judge has important duties to perform in relation to children particularly exposed to moral or physical dangers because of environment or other special circumstances, with power to place them in the care of persons, societies, schools, charitable organizations or social agencies. He is given broad powers to control the destinies of such children, including the power to remove them from the custody of their own parents. Such a power is not to be exercised lightly, and in entrusting it to a judge the Legislature has spelled out in s. 15 the circumstances which must exist before he can do so.\nUnder the first paragraph of s. 15(1) a child may be brought before a judge in one of two ways. A \"person in authority\" may bring a child before him or have him brought, when such child is \"particularly exposed to moral or physical dangers, by reason of its environment or other special circumstances, and for such reasons needs to be protected\".\nIt should be noted that the child must be \"particularly\" exposed to such dangers and needs to be protected.\nThe second paragraph of s. 15(1) contains specific instances of what may be considered as the conditions contemplated by the first paragraph. These include \"exhibiting serious character disturbances\".\nThe second way in which a child may be brought before a judge is by his own order, which he may make \"upon information which he deems serious\", to the effect that a child is in the conditions described earlier in the first paragraph of s. 15(1), and which have been described above.\nThis provides a method whereby a person not having custody or control of a child may seek the intervention of a judge to have such child brought before him, and it was this method which was invoked by Keller in the present case. The power of the judge to make such an order is set out in this subsection. He can do so only if he has information, which he deems serious, to the effect that the child is particularly exposed to moral or physical dangers by reason of environment or other special circumstances and for such reasons needs to be protected.\nI turn now to consider the information which was before the judge in the present case. It consisted of a written petition by Keller, sworn to before the judge, which read as follows:\nCANADA\nPROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nDISTRICT OF MONTREAL\nNO. 1481\/62\nSOCIAL WELFARE\nCOURT\nYouth Protection Schools Act\n(As modified by 14-15 Geo. VI,\nchapter 56).\nPetition re child GEORGE KELLER child of Mr. and Mrs. Stanislav Keller (Emily M.Kredl)\nI am one of the persons in authority mentioned in section 1 (paragraph e) of the Youth Protection Schools Act, to wit Mr. Stanislav Keller, father of the said child, 4461 Linton Ave., apt. 5.\nI have reasons to believe and I do believe that the child GEORGE KELLER under the age of eighteen years, is particularly exposed to moral and physical dangers by reasons of his environment or other special circumstances, and for such reasons needs to be protected. The boy is being kept away from the father, the boy is being prejudiced against the father, all of which may lead to serious character disturbances.\nWherefore I pray that one of the judges of the Court of Social Welfare apply the provisions of section 15 of the Youth Protection Schools Act (14 George VI Chapter II as modified by 14-15 Geo. VI, Chapter 56) and conduct an inquiry as to the particular circumstances in which this child is found.\n(Signed) STANISLAV KELLER\nSworn to before me at Montreal\nthis 9th day of November 1962.\n(Signed) J. W. Long,\nJudge of the Social Welfare Court\nDistrict of Montreal. The essential part of this petition is contained in the second paragraph. Keller there expresses a belief that George Keller is particularly exposed to moral and physical dangers by reason of his environment or other special circumstances and for such reasons needs to be protected. This is merely a repetition of the wording of the first sentence of s. 15(1). This, in my opinion, is not sufficient unless the facts on which that belief is founded are stated. Under s. 15, before ordering an inquiry, the judge must have before him information, which he deems serious. I understand this to mean an allegation of circumstances which create a particular exposure to moral or physical danger.\nKeller then goes on to state what are the reasons for his belief:\nThe boy is being kept away from the father, the boy is being prejudiced against the father, all of which may lead to serious character disturbances.\n(The italics are mine.)\nAs to the allegation that George Keller was being kept away from his father, it is clear that this separation was the consequence of the custody order granted by the Superior Court. Keller did allege, in his petition to the Superior Court of January 23, 1962, that he had been denied the right to see his children, given to him by the Superior Court, but he did not proceed with that petition, which was adjourned sine die.\nThe contention that the child was being prejudiced against the father and that this might lead to serious character disturbances is not, in my opinion, an allegation that the child was particularly exposed to moral or physical danger. The second paragraph of s. 15(1) refers to the actual exhibition of serious character disturbances.\nIn my opinion the judge did not have before him information to the effect that George Keller was in the conditions described in the first sentence of s. 15(1), and, that being so, he had no legal authority to bring the child before him for an inquiry.\nIn reaching this conclusion, I do not feel that I am adopting a technical approach to the provisions of the Youth Protection Act, which would impair its proper operation. The Act is an important means for the protection of neglected children and, for that reason, clothes the judge with wide powers. On the other hand, it certainly was not designed to serve as a weapon in the hands of a disgruntled parent who has been unsuccessful in custody proceedings in the Superior Court.\nIf it is open to any person to compel the appearance of a child before a judge for an inquiry merely by swearing to a belief that it is particularly exposed to moral or social danger the consequences may be serious indeed. Individual beliefs as to what constitutes moral danger to a child may vary widely. Consequently the Act requires that, before summoning a child before him for an inquiry, the judge must have information to the effect that the conditions defined in s. 15(1) do, in fact, exist. In my opinion the Act does not contemplate that, without that much information before him, a judge can compel a parent, in lawful custody of a child, to produce that child before him.\nThe holding of an inquiry, under s. 15, is a matter of serious consequence to a child and to the parent in lawful custody of that child. The child faces the possibility of being removed from the custody of its parent and being placed in the care of another person, school, institution or agency. The parent is faced with the possibility of a charge under s. 39(2) of the Act, the provisions of which have been previously quoted.\nIn my opinion, the appeal should be allowed, and the judgment of the Superior Court restored, with costs throughout.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, MARTLAND and HALL JJ. dissenting.\nAttorneys for the appellant: Biega, Beauregard & Kooiman, Montreal.\nAttorney for the respondents: L.

(Claimant) Appellant;\nand\nThe Metropolitan Corporation of Greater Winnipeg (Respondent) Respondent\n1965: October 19, 20; 1966: January 25.\nPresent: Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR MANITOBA\nExpropriation\u2014Part of claimant's property expropriated for traffic interchange\u2014Misapprehension of evidence upon which valuation of damages based\u2014Arbitrator's award reduced by Court of Appeal\u2014Majority judgment of Court of Appeal also found to have overlooked or misapprehended material evidence\u2014Compensation fixed by Supreme Court.\nThe appellant company owned a property at the north-east corner of Portage Avenue and Madison Street in the City of Winnipeg, having a frontage on Portage Avenue of 332.5 feet and a depth running along the easterly limit of Madison Street of 624.16 feet, containing 201,504 square feet. The respondent expropriated 55,521 square feet of the said property. The portion expropriated was at the south-west corner of the appellant's lands, i.e., that portion immediately adjacent to the intersection of Portage Avenue and Madison Street and after the expropriation the appellant was left with only 193.43 feet frontage on Portage Avenue plus an additional frontage on a widened portion of that avenue, and with no frontage remaining on Madison Street. The property was taken so that the respondent could construct on it and on other property in the area a large traffic interchange.\nThe appraisers for both the appellant and the respondent were in agreement that the value of the property before the expropriation would have averaged about $2.85 per square foot. They differed, however, when they came to value what was left after the expropriation. The appellant's appraiser valued this at $1.25 per square foot, the respondent's appraiser at $2.60 per square foot. In their evidence before the trial judge the appraisers attempted to use the \"before and after\" method of arriving at the damages suffered by the appellant. That is they found the value of the property as a whole before the expropriation and then attempted to find the value of the property left after the expropriation, and by deducting the latter figure from the former, they purported to find the amount of damage that the appellant suffered by the expropriation. Having found that the evidence was not sufficient to apply the \"before and after\" method in a proper manner, the trial judge, taking part of the evidence of the respondent's appraiser, proceeded on a frontage basis and arrived at a valuation of $280,000. The majority in the Court of Appeal in reducing the award to $195,000 found error in the trial judge's method of valuation.\nHeld (Judson J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the compensation fixed at $242,000. Per Martland, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ.: The trial judge was entitled to fix a valuation for the premises which were expropriated rather than attempt a \"before and after\" method, but in so doing he had misapprehended the evidence upon which he based his valuation of damages. This placed the Court of Appeal in the position where it was necessary to \"make its own valuation on a proper and recognized basis\". The majority in that Court, accepting the evidence of the respondent's appraiser, turned back to the \"before and after\" method. If they were justified in accepting the said evidence it must be upon a consideration that that evidence was so plainly correct and of such preponderance that the finding of the trial judge could not be maintained in opposition to it.\nAn examination of the evidence of the respondent's appraiser showed that there was no sound basis for starting his calculation of injurious affection by deducting a certain amount from the artificial figure of $2.85 per square foot. Secondly, he was of the opinion that the value of the property after the taking had not been reduced in value except for the 25\u00a2 per square foot reduction he allowed on the question of access. This opinion could not be supported by the evidence.\nThe majority judgment of the Court of Appeal had also overlooked or seriously misapprehended much material evidence of fact, and this Court, as was the Court of Appeal, was called upon to \"make its own valuation on a proper and recognized basis\". This task had already been done for the Court in the dissenting judgment of Schultz J.A. in the Court below, where, as here, the following elements were considered:\u2014the construction greatly reducing the suitability of the remaining property for expropriation purposes, eliminating or lessening many of the advantages it possessed; the problem of access involved in the curving roadways having ostensible purpose of facilitating traffic; the change from a corner type property to a property abutting on a busy traffic interchange; the extremely wide frontage on Portage Avenue combined with the great depth being now reduced by about one-third, and left of irregular shape, including an unusable triangle and the great interference with access.\nSchultz J.A. adopted two methods of considering the valuation, i.e., a \"before and after\" method and the actual valuation of the property taken; by either method the valuation arrived at was roughly $242,000. In view of the fact that the latter calculation by frontage did not consider the injurious affection to the balance of the property, the valuation arrived at by fixing a deduction on square foot rate for the injurious affection of the property which remained was a sounder method. The reasons for judgment of Schultz J.A. were accepted in that they arrived at a sum of $242,000 particularly by the use of that method.\nPer Judson J., dissenting: The \"before and after\" approach was the only possible approach in this case. The land taken, had it stood alone, would have been close to being unmarketable. No one would have paid $280,000 for it and there was no suggestion that it could have been sold separately. The majority in the Court of Appeal were correct in accepting the evidence of the respondent's expert in preference to that of the claimant's expert. The latter expert had made five basic errors in arriving at his opinion of value. APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, allowing an appeal from an expropriation award by Solomon Co.Ct.J. Appeal allowed, Judson J. dissenting.\nClive K. Tallin, Q.C., and. J. McJannett, for the appellant.\nD. C. Lennox and F. N. Steele, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Martland, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nSPENCE J.:\u2014This is an appeal by the claimant from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba pronounced on December 31, 1964. By that judgment the Court allowed an appeal by the present respondent from the judgment of His Honour Judge J. R. Solomon pronounced on March 18, 1964, in which he had fixed the damages of the claimant for the expropriation of part of its property by the respondent at $280,000.\nThe Chief Justice of Manitoba, with Mr. Justice Guy and Mr. Justice Monnin concurring, allowed the appeal from a judgment of the County Court Judge by reducing the amount of the said damages to $195,000. Mr. Justice Schultz dissenting would only have varied the judgment of the trial judge by reducing the damages allowed from $284,000 to $242,000.\nIt would seem that no purpose can be served by a review of the jurisprudence in reference to the variation by the Court of Appeal of an award made by an arbitrator. Sufficient to say that the Court of Appeal has jurisdiction to act when the arbitrator has proceeded on some incorrect principle or has overlooked or misapprehended some material evidence of fact. With respect it would appear that both of those grounds for variation of award were present in this case.\nThe appellant owned a property at the north-east corner of Portage Avenue and Madison Street in the City of Winnipeg, having a frontage on Portage Avenue of 332.5 feet and a depth running along the easterly limit of Madison Street of 624.16 feet, containing 201,504 square feet. By By-law No. 202, registered in the Winnipeg Land Titles Office on June 26, 1962, the Metropolitan Corpora- tion of Greater Winnipeg expropriated 55,521 square feet of the said property. The portion expropriated was at the south-west corner of the appellant's lands, i.e., that portion immediately adjacent to the intersection of Portage Avenue and Madison Street and after the expropriation the appellant was left with only 193.43 feet frontage on Portage Avenue plus an additional footage to which reference shall be made hereafter on what turns out to be a widened portion of Portage Avenue, and with no frontage remaining on Madison Street.\nThe extent of and the effect of the expropriation may best be visualized by a scrutiny of Schedule B of Exhibit 23 a plan attached to the report of the appraiser who gave evidence for the respondent. What remained was a property consisting of 145,983 square feet having an average width of about 210 feet by a depth of 646 feet but being irregular in shape on both the south limit and the west limit and including a sharp triangle where the property ran out to Madison Street at a point.\nThe purpose of the expropriation is in the present case most important. The property was taken so that the Metropolitan Corporation of Greater Winnipeg could construct on it and on other property in the area a large traffic interchange providing a new access to the St. James Bridge which crosses the Assiniboine River to the south of Portage Avenue. The effect of this interchange construction will be considered in some detail hereafter.\nBefore the learned County Court Judge evidence was given by appraisers called both on behalf of the claimant and on behalf of the respondent Corporation. Those witnesses were in substantial agreement that the property expropriated was in the middle of a very rapidly growing commercial area and in fact the appraiser for the municipal Corporation the respondent, swore that since 1960 the property in the area had, in many cases, more than doubled in value. They were in agreement that the value of the property before the expropriation would have averaged about $2.85 per square foot. From that point, however, the witnesses varied most startlingly. The appraiser for the claimant put the value of the premises which remained after the taking at only $1.25 per square foot, while the appraiser called for the respondent municipal Corporation put the value of the property which remained at $2.60 per square foot. Commenting on that evidence the learned County Court Judge said:\nI am satisfied that both appraisers placed such value on the subject property after expropriation which would reflect the claims of their respective clients. I am satisfied that the value of the subject property after expropriation is more than $1.25 per square foot but less than $2.60 per square foot if the formula the appraisers used is to be applied for arriving at the value of the expropriated land.\nI adopt herein the reasons for judgment of Schultz J.A. in the Court of Appeal for Manitoba when he said:\n\u2026Where the experts' opinions vary as much as they do here the question of their competence, credibility and the weight of their testimony is primarily for the trial judge. This Court has consistently adhered to the policy of not requiring a trial judge to believe evidence which he finds unconvincing and of declining to substitute its judgment for his upon issues which it is his function to determine. The learned trial judge has made it convincingly clear that he could not and did not accept either of the valuations submitted by the appraisers as to the loss in value to the claimant's property as a result of the expropriation, and, with respect, I do not think this Court can disregard his finding in that regard. Having reached that conclusion, the learned trial judge proceeded to make his award on a basis I will discuss later.\nIn their evidence before the learned County Court Judge, both the appraisers called on behalf of the appellant and the appraiser called on behalf of the respondent Corporation had attempted to use the \"before and after\" method of arriving at the damages suffered by the appellant. That is they found the value of the property as a whole before the expropriation and then attempted to find the value of the property left after the expropriation, and by deducting the latter figure from the former, the appraisers purported to find the amount of the damage that the appellant suffered by the expropriation. As Schultz J.A. remarked in his reasons for judgment in the Court of Appeal of Manitoba:\n\u2026Theoretically, but only theoretically, the 'before and after' method is ideal, for the result presumably includes in one lump sum all of the factors of compensation requiring consideration, namely, value of the land taken, plus severance damage to the remainder, less special benefits arising out of the taking.\nHaving expressed his dissatisfaction with the evidence of the expert witnesses as to the value of the property after expropriation in the terms which I have quoted above, the learned County Court Judge then turned to part of the evidence given by the appraiser for the respondent municipal Corporation. That expert witness, one Farstad, had tried various methods of arriving at his result and in one of those methods he divided the property into a strip of 332.6 feet in length and 120 feet in depth along the north side of Portage Avenue and then another strip commencing at the rear of the first on Madison Avenue of 410 feet in length by about 111 feet in depth and then the balance of the property to the rear of the two pieces which he found amounted to about 97,140 square feet, and he placed values before expropriation of $1,000 per frontage foot for the 332.6 feet fronting on Portage Avenue and $350 per frontage foot for the 410 feet fronting on Madison Street, and $1 per square foot for the 97,140 square feet in the inside property, thereby arriving at a total value of the land before expropriation of $573,240.\nThe learned trial judge simply applied these frontage values to the property taken describing it as 141.17 feet on Portage Avenue and 410 feet on Madison Street and, allowing the Portage Avenue feet at $1,000 per frontage foot, obtained a damage of $141,170 and allowing the $350 rate to the 410 feet frontage on Madison Street, found a damage of $143,500. Those two amounts he totalled to $284,670 and then deducted therefrom the $4,670 because a part of the frontage taken on the Portage Avenue side was only to a very short depth.\nIt will be seen that the County Court Judge thereby deserted the \"before and after\" method of arriving at the damages. Of course, the County Court Judge was entitled to refrain from adopting that method when he found that the evidence was not sufficient for him to apply it in a proper manner.\nWith respect I agree with the Chief Justice of Manitoba when he said:\nI am of the opinion that the learned County Court Judge oversimplified his valuation. He disregarded the approaches of the appraisers of both sides and simply adopted figures that had been mentioned in one of the appraisal reports.\nIt should be noted that the learned County Court Judge in proceeding in the said fashion fell into these errors of principle or failure to comprehend the evidence:\n(1) By applying the valuations to the expropriated property without considering any injurious affection on the balance of the property he arrived at a result which failed to give due weight to the latter factor.\n(2) Secondly, and most important, he did not realize that the appraiser giving the evidence had given such frontage valuations on the basis that the premises were to be sold in one lot including the large square foot area to the rear of both frontages. It should be noted that the said appraiser in giving evidence said:\nIn my opinion if it had been, and this does not mean that it would have been sold in separate parcels, I merely indicated values to the overall development of this whole site based on probable values indicated on Portage Avenue, that is, the property had a value as high as $1,000 per foot for which 332.6 feet was $332,600. The Madison Street frontage averaged 410 feet at $350 per foot for a value of $143,500 and the remaining inside land of 97,140 square feet at $1.00 per square foot amounting to $97,140 for a total of $573,240. (The italics are my own.).\n(3) The learned trial Judge fixed the frontage on Portage Avenue taken in the expropriation at 141.17 feet and although he allowed $4,670 off the value of such frontage, by such allowance he failed signally to reflect the fact that of that frontage 46.39 feet were taken only to a depth of about 50 feet so that the effective taking away of Portage Avenue frontage, remembering that the balance fronted on Portage Avenue as widened, was only 94.78 feet.\nTo summarize, the learned County Court Judge was entitled to fix a valuation for the premises which were expropriated rather than attempt a \"before and after\" method, but in so doing he misapprehended the evidence upon which he based his valuation of damages.\nUnder such circumstances I agree with the Chief Justice of Manitoba when he stated:\nThis places this Court in the position where it must make its own valuation on a proper and recognized basis.\nThe Chief Justice then turned back to the \"before and after\" method of arriving at a quantum of damages. This course the Chief Justice was entitled to take as was the County Court Judge in his refusal to use that basis, the latter being of the opinion that the evidence upon which it could be used had not been given. The Chief Justice continued:\nI favour the appraisal arrived at by Mr. Farstad, the appraiser for the respondent, The Metropolitan Corporation of Greater Winnipeg. He has made several approaches, all of which are reasonable, well-balanced, and would stand scrutiny. In his summary of values Mr. Farstad proposes:\nValue before the taking\n$ 575,000\nValue after the taking\n380,000\nDifference, including all damages\nto the remainder\n$ 195,000\nI have already quoted and adopted the statement of Schultz J.A. as to the task of the Court of Appeal in considering the finding of a trial judge as to the testimony given by expert witnesses. Therefore, it is my view that if the majority of the Court of Appeal were justified in accepting the evidence of Mr. Farstad, it must be upon a consideration that that evidence was so plainly correct and of such preponderance that the finding of the learned County Court Judge could not be maintained in opposition to it.\nLet us examine the evidence of Mr. Farstad leading him to give the results quoted by the Chief Justice of Manitoba. The value before taking of $575,000 was arrived at, as I have said, by two methods: Firstly, by taking $1,000 per frontage foot for 332.6 feet on Portage Avenue, plus $350 per frontage foot for 410 feet on Madison Street, and then $1 per square foot for 97,140 square feet of the back property, and also by hitting a mean between $2.75 and $3 a square foot for the whole property. Since $575,000 for 201,594 square feet is at the rate of $2.85 per square foot, one wonders whether the evidence is not an example of what Schultz J. A. was referring to when he said:\nAny result can be predetermined by simply altering any one of such factors.\nWhat must be realized is that this sum of $575,000 is in fact the total of three valuations, i.e., 332.6 feet frontage on Portage Avenue by a depth of 120 feet at $1,000 a foot; 410 frontage feet on Madison Street by a depth of 111 feet, at $350 a foot; and 97,140 square feet to the rear at a rate of $1 per square foot. If the square foot rate of the 332.6 frontage feet on Portage Avenue were taken on this basis, it would be, not $2.85 per square foot, but $7.14; and if the square foot rate of the 410 feet frontage on Madison Street were taken at this rate, it would not be $2.85, but $3.51. It must also be remembered that all of the property expropriated was within those two pieces of frontage. I am therefore of the opinion that there was no sound basis for Mr. Farstad starting his calculation of injurious affection by deducting a certain amount from the artificial figure of $2.85 per square foot.\nSecondly, Mr. Farstad only allowed a deduction of 25\u00a2 per square foot from that figure of $2.85 per square foot to cover the injurious affection of the land and it was put by counsel for the respondent the evidence would seem to justify the view that the whole of that 25\u00a2 was attributable to the reduced access to the new property. Yet Mr. Farstad, even on examination-in-chief, described the property remaining as\nA long narrow strip of land remaining for eventual development.\nIn cross-examination Mr. Farstad attempted to maintain that the property before taking was also \"narrow to some extent for certain types of development\", yet he admitted that the original frontage on Portage Avenue of 332 feet was more than a full city block. He further admitted in cross-examination that although the premises had been suitable for a super market or a motor hotel development, and perhaps even a department or discount store or highrise apartment, that it was no longer suitable for the same range of commercial or industrial or even residential development. His actual reply was:\nThere would be some restrictions against some of these things, yes. There would be a lesser number of potential developments on the site.\nAgain, Mr. Farstad admitted that although there was a frontage remaining on Portage Avenue, as a result of the expropriation, there was no frontage remaining on Madison Street as the side there was not on a street. This I shall deal with later when I speak of the question of access.\nWhy then did Mr. Farstad find that the value of the property after the taking had not been reduced in value except for the 25\u00a2 reduction he allowed on the question of access? It would appear from a perusal of the evidence that Mr. Farstad arrived at this conclusion by considering that many of the properties bordering the north side of Portage Avenue west of Madison Street had been removed so that now it was possible to see the subject property from the St. James Hotel site some distance east of it, and that therefore the property had an \"advertising value\" and a \"corner influence\" which it had not possessed before.\nIn evidence, Mr. Farstad, when asked what effect the demolition had upon the subject property, answered:\nA. This has really opened up the area completely. From the St. James Hotel to the subject property there are no more buildings.\nQ. When you used the words opened up, what do you mean?\nA. In other words, you now have a complete view of the property from any point at the St. James Hotel or as you are driving by. And further:\nQ. Yes, it is not on a street. Would you say that frontage that is not on a street has any great value as commercial or industrial use?\nA. I would say this property has after because of the fact that it can be seen. Access of course is a problem but this does still have corner influence in a sense.\nQ. There might be some corner influence?\nA. There is.\nQ. But it would not be worth $350 a foot?\nA. It could well continue to be worth $350 to some potential buyer.\nQ. But not to many?\nA. Maybe not to some.\nTo the Court in answer to the question:\nQ. You were considering by putting this loop or this interchange that this might better the location to some extent; is that your opinion?\nA. That is right, sir, because of the opening up of the demolition of the buildings to the west. So some of this was betterment in my opinion. And I know this is purely a matter of opinion.\nIt would appear that Mr. Farstad's evidence is based on a view of the property after demolition had proceeded so that the whole area was a bare flat one and did not take into consideration that that area did not so remain, but in it there was placed a very large overpass and interchange. Although the only exhibit which showed the site after the construction will have been completed is Exhibit 19, and that is a plot plan without elevations, it is apparent that the plan was to have Portage Avenue cross over the level of Kensington Street. Through the area Portage Avenue would appear to have two lanes, one for eastbound and one for westbound traffic, each about 51 feet wide with a median strip running down the centre some 7 feet wide. The \"corner influence\" and the \"advertising value\" would be with reference to those persons who are proceeding from west to east on Portage Avenue approaching the premises from Queen Street or one of the streets to the north. Those persons would be driving on the right hand or southerly side of the street with a 7-foot median to their left, then another 50 feet of pavement and in addition some type of railing must run along the northerly side of the bridge over Kensington Street.\nMoreover, the subject property will be right at this great interchange and under such circumstances I cannot see that there is any advertising value which will make any marked difference in the damage caused by the expropriation. Drivers of vehicles eastbound on Portage Avenue will have little opportunity to look to their left across median, pavement and bridge rail to observe the subject property. Drivers of vehicles northbound under the underpass will not even be able to see the subject property as they will be running in a channel some thirteen feet deep. Drivers of vehicles winding their way up the loops from the underpass to Portage Avenue will be too much engaged to look around at properties. I am therefore of the opinion that the so-called advertising value of the property has been much exaggerated.\nWhat remains is a property not one of the largest available in that area of Portage Avenue, as the evidence showed it was before the expropriation, and which was about 330 feet on Portage Avenue by 645 feet odd in depth, but a property of only an average width of 211 feet with less frontage on Portage Avenue and which, on its southerly and westerly borders, is of uneven contour and includes a sharp triangle which will be most difficult to develop.\nWhen one turns to the question of access, an even more startling situation is revealed. Exhibit 12, a sketch, illustrates the access prior to the taking and shows a total of five accesses, two directly from Portage Avenue and three directly from Madison Street on a level. In addition there was one other access from a lane running easterly from Madison Avenue and then turning southerly into the property. That lane was only 30 feet wide to the corner and from there westerly only 20 feet. It was said that the lane was of little use as an access and one cannot imagine a long vehicle negotiating that sharp turn into a 20-foot roadway with any success. The access after the taking is illustrated in Exhibit 13. The two entries from Portage Avenue have been reduced to one. There is an entry and an exit into the southerly or outer loop of the interchange and there remains the access to the rear through the lane which I have described.\nExhibit 19, the plot plan, illustrates the first three of these accesses after the taking. It will be noted that the accesses on to the loop are of very little value for either northbound or southbound traffic on the loops. The northbound traffic is running in a loop of an interchange and drivers would find, I think, some hazard in even turning right into the premises at the most westerly of the two cuts in the curve. Similarly, a driver leaving the premises through the most easterly would find difficulty in driving into the traffic along that loop. The entry for the person who had been northbound and who came through the interchange, swung around the inner loop and then dived\u2014and I think that is an appropriate word\u2014through the opening in the median across the outer loop and into the subject property would be most hazardous. Moreover, these two accesses cut into the property from the outer loop are subject to future action by the municipality should the traffic conditions show that their use was causing an obstruction to traffic, and the claimant has been warned that action will be taken to close the accesses in such event.\nI am of the view, therefore, that there has been a very serious limitation in the access to the property by the replacement of the three straight entries on to Madison Street, a two-way street, with these two provisional and conditional cuts from a loop into the property and of the elimination of one of the two access entries from Portage Avenue.\nIt would seem, therefore, that again Mr. Farstad's opinion that such interference with access only made a diminution of 25\u00a2 per square foot in the value of the property ascertained cannot be supported by the evidence. I am in agreement with the view expressed by Schultz J.A., when he said:\n\u2026The difficult conditions existing in regard to access after the taking would unquestionably be considered as having some element of hazard by a prudent investor as compared to the situation before expropriation when northbound traffic was completely free of any such hazards.\nSouthbound traffic had direct access to the property via Madison Street prior to the taking. This approach is now eliminated and access from the north much longer and more circuitous.\nI am, therefore, of the opinion that the majority judgment of the Court of Appeal of Manitoba has also overlooked or seriously misapprehended much material evidence of fact, and that this Court, as was the Court of Appeal of Manitoba, is called upon to \"make its own valuation on a proper and recognized basis\". It would appear, however, that that task has already been done for us in the dissenting judgment of Schultz J.A., in the Court of Appeal for Manitoba. The learned Justice of Appeal has considered all of the elements to which I have referred hereinbefore, i.e., the construction greatly reducing the suitability of the remaining property for expropriation purposes, eliminating or lessening many of the advantages it possessed; the problem of access involved in the curving roadways having ostensible purpose of facilitating traffic; the change from a corner type property to a property abutting on a busy traffic interchange; the extremely wide frontage on Portage Avenue combined with the great depth being now reduced by about one-third, and left of irregular shape, including the unusable triangle to which I have referred and the great interference with access. The learned Justice of Appeal adopts two methods of considering the valuation. In the first place, taking the $2.85 average valuation arrived at by Mr. Farstad by the arithmetical calculation to which I have referred above, he then reduced it by a factor for injurious affection of the property which remained for all of these reasons, i.e., a \"before and after\" method. The learned Justice of Appeal, however, adopts, in my view, a much more realistic factor than that given by Mr. Farstad and adopted in the majority judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba. In the evidence, as given by Mr. Farstad, appears this sentence:\nAnd with all this it is my opinion that the remaining land after the taking was worth $2.60 a square foot, which is only 25 per cent per square foot less than the $2.85 I gave or $379,555, make it $330,000.\nThis is, of course, an obvious error. $2.60 is only 8.7 per cent less than $2.85.\nIt may be that the error is that of the stenographer; on the other hand, the words \"per cent\" might have been said. It may be that the majority of the Court of Appeal were misled in considering that a 25 per cent reduction had been allowed rather than only a 25 cents reduction. At any rate, a reduction of 8.7 per cent, in my view, is not realistic and I am ready to agree with Schultz J.A. that a proper and realistic reduction is the 20 per cent reduction which he was ready to allow, i.e., to value the property remaining after expropriation at $2.28 per square foot which would give a valuation of the damages caused at $241,445. Schultz J.A., however, realized that such procedure was subject to the many difficulties inherent in the \"before and after\" method and therefore preferred to use the same method as used by the trial judge, i.e., the actual valuation of the property taken. Noting that the true frontage on Portage Avenue was not 141.17 feet but only 94.78 feet, the learned Justice of Appeal was ready to allow $1,000 per foot for that frontage, i.e., $94,780, and then the same $350 for the 410 feet frontage on Madison Street, i.e., $143,500, and then added an amount for the narrow strip erroneously included in the frontage by the learned trial Judge and fixed that amount at $4,000 to arrive at a total of $242,000. So that, by either method, Schultz J.A.'s valuation arrives at roughly $242,000, an amount which he would have been ready to allow. In view of the fact that the latter calculation by frontage foot does not consider the injurious affection to the balance of the property, a subject which was very carefully dealt with in the reasons of Schultz J.A., I am of the opinion that the valuation arrived at by fixing a deduction on square foot rate for the injurious affection of the property which remains is a sounder method and I am ready to accept the reasons for judgment of Schultz J.A. in that they arrive at a sum of roughly $242,000 particularly by the use of that method.\nThere was considerable discussion during the argument as to interest. Counsel finally expressed the view that the interest adjustments could be left to their consultation and, if necessary, they could speak to the Court later.\nI would allow the appeal and fix the compensation at $242,000; the claimant is entitled to the arbitration costs as provided in the trial Court; there should be no costs in the appeal and the claimant should have the costs of the appeal to this Court.\nJUDSON J. (dissenting):\u2014The majority of the Court of Appeal in reducing the award of the arbitrator from $280,000 to $195,000 found error in his method of valuation. The case was put before him by both experts in the same way. They valued the whole property before expropriation at approximately the same figure\u2014in one case $2.85 per square foot and the other, $2.60 per square foot. They differed when they came to value what was left after the expropriation. The claimant's expert valued this at $1.25 per square foot, Metro's expert at $2.60 per square foot. The arbitrator did not think that the figure of $1.25 was of any use to him. On the other hand, he expressed dissatisfaction with the $2.60 figure but perhaps not quite as emphatically. He then took part of the evidence of Metro's expert and arrived at this valuation:\nPortage Avenue:\n141.17 feet at $1,000 per ft.\n$ 141,170\nMadison Street:\n410 feet at $350 per ft.\n$ 143,500\n$ 284,670\nfrom which he deducted the sum of $4,670, leaving him with a round figure of $280,000.\nThe Court of Appeal thought this was an oversimplification of the problem and that it involved the misuse of the expert's figures that were given for an entirely different purpose:\nThese values of $1,000 per foot and $350 per foot respectively were mentioned by Mr. Farstad, the appraiser for The Metropolitan Corporation of Greater Winnipeg, respondent, in his appraisal report, Exhibit 23, but not for the purpose for which they were used by the learned County Court Judge. Farstad used these figures as part of his \"before and after\" approach. One need only look at the plan and see how narrow and poorly proportioned the expropriated land is, to realize that it could not, standing by itself, be worth the $280,000 value attributed to it by the learned County Court Judge. The learned Judge did not allow, in his assessment of compensation, anything for injurious affection to the remaining parcel but simply sought to value the expropriated part and the evidence does not support his figure.\nI agree with this criticism. I do not think that it was open to the arbitrator to deal with the problem as he did, having regard to the evidence before him. In my opinion, the approach of the experts was the only possible approach in this case. Metro took an irregular piece of land which, had it stood alone, would have been close to being unmarketable. This is the point of the criticism of the Chief Justice. No one would have paid $280,000 for this parcel of land and there was no suggestion in the evidence that it could have been sold separately. This emphasizes that the \"before and after\" approach was the only possible one in this case, and we have this common element that both experts were very close together in their valuation of the whole parcel.\nThe Court of Appeal, therefore, began with the figure given by Metro's expert of $575,000. They also accepted this expert's valuation of the property after the taking, and the difference was $195,000. They had good reason for rejecting the low valuation of $1.25 per square foot for the remainder of the property which was made by the claimant's expert. As pointed out by counsel for the respondent, this expert made five basic errors in arriving at his opinion of value. These errors were:\n(a) The zoning of the area was stated to be M2.\n(b) The area of land being appraised incorrectly contained land which was not owned by the Claimant as at the date of the valuation.\n(c) The estimate of value before the taking was based on an incorrect land area which did not include all of the land which was actually owned by the Claimant.\n(d) One of the advantages attributed to the site before the taking, namely frontage, was incorrect with reference to the number of thoroughfares and actual frontage.\n(e) There was an error of omission in that no reference was made to the access to the site from the public lane off Madison Street, either before or after the taking.\nThe issue in this appeal is whether the majority in the Court of Appeal were right in accepting the evidence of Metro's expert in preference to that of the claimant's expert. There is no doubt in my mind that they were.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs, JUDSON J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Tallin, Kristjansson, Parker, Martin & Mercury, Winnipeg.\nSolicitor for the respondent: D.

A chart of the harbour, No. 2314 of the Canadian Hydrographic Survey, which was on board, showed a depth alongside the dock of 19 feet, which, when adjusted to conform with the hydrographic survey gauge, became 18 1\/2 feet. The ship also carried a document entitled \"By-Laws and General Information\" issued by the Lakehead Harbour Commissioners, which showed a mean water depth of 21.2 feet at the same berth. Upon reaching the point where the ship was drawing 19 feet 8 inches forward, it was decided that she should be shifted forward so as to load additional grain in the after hatches. Before ordering the ship to be moved forward, the mate, who seemed to have been in charge of the loading, stated that he called out to a man on the dock who turned out to be the superintendent of the elevator in question, asking whether there was \"lots of water\" and received an affirmative reply. The ship was then winched ahead, grounded and was damaged. The trial judge dismissed the claim of the ship as well as the claim of the other plaintiff, the owner of the wheat cargo which was damaged. The plaintiffs appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed. There was no negligence on the part of either defendants which was causative of the grounding and consequent damage.\nAs to the appeal against the Lakehead Harbour Commissioners. There was no evidence of any obstructions in the berth, and the nature of the lake bottom was such as to be anticipated in the area in question. There was no reason to question the finding of fact made by the trial judge that there was no believable evidence which would tend to show that the ship believed or acted upon the pamphlet issued by the Lakehead Harbour.\nAs to the appeal against the Manitoba Pool Elevators Ltd. There was no danger in the berth in question until the ship rested on the bottom, and the short conversation between the mate and the superintendent could not be treated as a warranty. The motivating concern in the mind of those in charge of the ship was to load as much wheat as her winter draft would allow, and the possibility of the ship taking ground was a secondary consideration.\nIt was not necessary to consider the question of whether the Lakehead Harbour Commissioners was an agency of the Crown to which the provisions of s. 11 of the Public Authorities Protection Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 318, would apply.\nNavigation\u2014Dommages\u2014N\u00e9gligence\u2014\u00c9chouage d'un bateau alors qu'il prenait une cargaison au port de la T\u00eate des Lacs.\nLa demanderesse, Algoma Central and Hudson Bay Railway Company, a poursuivi les d\u00e9fendeurs pour dommages subis par son bateau Algoway lorsqu'il s'est \u00e9chou\u00e9 en prenant une cargaison de bl\u00e9 au quai de la d\u00e9fenderesse, Manitoba Pool Elevators Ltd., situ\u00e9 dans les limites du port de la T\u00eate des Lacs. Une carte du port, no 2314 du Canadian Hydrographic Survey, qui \u00e9tait \u00e0 bord, montrait une profondeur de 19 pieds le long du quai, laquelle, lorsqu'elle \u00e9tait ajust\u00e9e pour se conformer \u00e0 l'indicateur du relev\u00e9 hydrographique, devenait 18 1\/2 pieds. Le bateau avait aussi \u00e0 bord un document intitul\u00e9 \"By-laws and General Information\" \u00e9mis par les Commissaires du port de la T\u00eate des Lacs, qui montrait une moyenne de profondeur de 21.2 pieds \u00e0 ce m\u00eame endroit. Ayant atteint le point o\u00f9 le bateau tirait 19 pieds 8 pouces en avant, on a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'il devait \u00eatre avanc\u00e9 pour charger la cale arri\u00e8re de grains additionnels. Avant d'ordonner que le bateau soit avanc\u00e9, le second officier, qui semblait \u00eatre en charge du chargement, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 un homme qui se tenait sur le quai et qui \u00e9tait le surveillant de l'\u00e9l\u00e9vateur en question s'il y avait de l'eau en quantit\u00e9, ce \u00e0 quoi l'autre a r\u00e9pondu affirmativement. Le bateau a alors \u00e9t\u00e9 avanc\u00e9 par treuil, \u00e9choua et fut endommag\u00e9. Le juge au proc\u00e8s a rejet\u00e9 la r\u00e9clamation du bateau ainsi que celle de l'autre demanderesse, la propri\u00e9taire de la cargaison de bl\u00e9 qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 endommag\u00e9e. Les demanderesses en ont appel\u00e9 devant cette Cour.\nArr\u00eat: L'appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9. Il n'y a eu aucune n\u00e9gligence de la part des d\u00e9fendeurs qui ait caus\u00e9 l'\u00e9chouage et le dommage qui en est r\u00e9sult\u00e9.\nQuant \u00e0 l'appel contre les Commissaires du port de la T\u00eate des Lacs. Il n'y avait aucune preuve d'obstruction \u00e0 l'endroit en question, et la nature du lit du lac \u00e9tait telle qu'elle devait \u00eatre anticip\u00e9e \u00e0 l'endroit en question. II n'y avait pas lieu de mettre en question la conclusion sur les faits du juge au proc\u00e8s \u00e0 l'effet qu'il n'y avait pas de preuve croyable tendant \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer que les officiers du bateau avaient cru ou s'en \u00e9taient rapport\u00e9s \u00e0 la brochure \u00e9mise par les Commissaires.\nQuant \u00e0 l'appel contre la Manitoba Pool Elevators Ltd. Il n'y avait aucun danger dans l'endroit en question jusqu'\u00e0 ce que le bateau ait touch\u00e9 le fond, et la courte conversation entre le second officier et le surveillant ne pouvait pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant une garantie. L'int\u00e9r\u00eat primordial dans l'esprit de ceux qui \u00e9taient en charge du bateau \u00e9tait de charger autant de bl\u00e9 que son tirage d'hiver le permettait, et la possibilit\u00e9 que le bateau pourrait s'\u00e9chouer \u00e9tait une consid\u00e9ration secondaire.\nIl n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire de consid\u00e9rer la question de savoir si les Commissaires du port de la T\u00eate des Lacs \u00e9tait une agence de la Couronne \u00e0 qui les dispositions de l'art. 11 du Public Authorities Protection Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 318, devait s'appliquer.\nAPPEL d'un jugement du Juge Wells, du district d'amiraut\u00e9 de l'Ontario[1] .

Fisher, for the appellant, Algoma Central and Hudson Bay Ry. Co.\nJ Mahoney, for the appellant, Parrish and Heimbecker Ltd.\nP. B. C. Pepper, Q.C., and A. S. Hindman, for the respondent Manitoba Pool Elevators Ltd\nB. Jas. Thomson, Q.C., for the respondent, Lakehead Harbour Commissioners. The judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of Mr. Justice Dalton C. Wells sitting in his capacity as District Judge in Admiralty for the Ontario Admiralty District of the Exchequer Court of Canada[3] whereby he dismissed a claim by The Algoma Central and Hudson Bay Railway Company (hereinafter called \"Algoma\") for damage sustained by its vessel Algoway through grounding whilst taking on a cargo of wheat at a dock and grain elevator known as Manitoba Pool No. 2 owned and operated by the respondent Manitoba Pool Elevators Limited (hereinafter called \"Manitoba\") and situate within the limits of the Lakehead Harbour as the same are defined in s. 4 of c. 34 of the the Statutes of Canada 1958, by which Act the respondent, Lakehead Harbour Commissioners (hereinafter called \"Lakehead\") was incorporated.\nBy the same judgment the learned District Judge dismissed the claim of the appellant Parrish & Heimbecker Limited (hereinafter referred to as \"Parrish\") the owner of the wheat cargo carried on board the Algoway at the time of its grounding which was damaged as the result of the incursion of water resulting therefrom.\nOn November 29, 1961, the Algoway having already loaded some 94,000 bushels of wheat at the Thunderbay elevator which is also within the Lakehead Harbour, was directed to a berth at Manitoba Pool No. 2 about 13\/4 miles to the northward, at which latter position the master and mate intended to load sufficient wheat to bring the Algoway to her mean winter draft of 19' 9 1\/2\". The master of the Algoway was unfamiliar with the berth to which he was directed but had on board for his guidance the official Canadian Hydrographic Survey Chart # 2314 as well as a Great Lakes Pilot (U.S. Lake Survey) and a sketch of the harbour which was incorporated in a pamphlet entitled \"Bylaws and General Information\" issued by Lakehead. Chart # 2314 shows a maximum depth of 19 ft. at the Manitoba Pool No. 2 berth, which, when adjusted to conform with the hydrographic survey gauge at Port Arthur, would read 18' 6\" whereas information contained in the Lakehead pamphlet under the heading \"Working data\u2014Port Arthur Harbour\" shows a mean water depth of 21.2 ft. at the same berth.\nOn reaching Pool No. 2, the Algoway was secured at the west side of the berth and loading was commenced in the forward hatches, but upon reaching the point where the ship was drawing 19' 8\" forward and 18' 3\" aft it was decided that she should be shifted forward so as to load additional grain in the after hatches in order to trim the vessel to her winter marks. Before ordering the ship to be moved forward, the mate, who appears to have been in charge of loading on board the Algoway at the time, states that he called out to a man on the dock who turned out to be the superintendent of the Manitoba Pool Elevator No. 2, asking whether there was \"lots of water\" and received the reply that there was lots of water and that boats were loaded there at a draft of 21 and 21.6 ft. Upon receiving this assurance the Algoway was winched ahead by the use of its own winches and it was found that she had taken ground and that water was coming in No. 1 starboard tank. Subsequent examination revealed that, as might have been anticipated, when the heavily laden forward section of the ship was thus brought forcibly in contact with the rough bottom of the Lake, a hole was punctured in one of the starboard plates and five other plates were damaged.\nThe chief negligence alleged against Lakehead by both appellants is that the pamphlet entitled \"Bylaws and General Information\" published by it was inaccurate and misleading and reflected a failure on the part of Lakehead to ascertain the actual depths of water at the various berths where ships were invited to dock, and it is further alleged that Lakehead, as the corporation having jurisdiction over the Harbour in question, was under a duty to warn those in charge of the Algoway of the actual condition of the berth to be used by it including the presence of any obstructions and the depth of the water to be expected therein.\nI agree with the learned trial judge that there is no evidence as to any obstructions in the berth and that the nature of the lake bottom was such as to be anticipated in the area in question. Counsel for both appellants, however, rested their case against Lakehead primarily on the fact that those in charge of the Algoway were entitled to rely on the representations as to the depth of water in Manitoba Pool No. 2 made in the pamphlet which has been referred to above.\nWith respect to the contention that the damage was caused as the result of those in charge of the Algoway having relied on this pamphlet, the learned trial judge said:\n\u2026there is no believable evidence in my opinion which would tend to show that they did believe or act on it.\nI see no reason to question this finding of fact which is so clearly based on the credibility of the witnesses who testified at the trial.\nThe safety of the ship is primarily the concern of its captain who is charged with navigating safely at all times, and if those in charge of the Algoway had relied on the Lakehead pamphlet they would have been ignoring the information which was clearly indicated on the Canadian Hydrographic Survey Chart # 2314 which, at the very least, should have put them on their guard against loading to the ship's winter marks at the berth to which they were directed.\nThe evidence is clear, however, that when the ship berthed at Manitoba Pool No. 2, the captain retired to his cabin and left the responsibility of loading to the mate who says that before moving the ship forward he relied, not on the Lakehead pamphlet, but upon the assurance of the superintendent of the Manitoba Pool No. 2 who happened to be on the dock, that there was enough water to load to the ship's winter draft.\nThe assurance so given to the mate is now relied on as forming the basis of the claim of both appellants against the respondent Manitoba and is alleged to have constituted an express warranty given by that Company as to the depth of water at its berth, and it is contended that Manitoba improperly invited or allowed the Algoway to come into and occupy a berth operated by it at a time when it knew or ought to have known that it was not safe for her to do so.\nThere was no danger in the berth in question until the ship rested on the bottom and I do not think that the short conversation between the mate speaking from the deck and the superintendent from the dock, can be treated as a warranty or that it constituted any assurance upon which the mate was entitled to rely in exposing the ship to the serious risk of grounding in these waters.\nIn reading the mate's evidence it occurs to me that he was not very much concerned as to whether the ship touched ground or not. In direct examination he was asked:\nQ. In the meantime, when you have been loading at the Lakehead, is it usual or unusual to touch ground from time to time ?\nA. I have loaded at elevators where we have rubbed the bottom.\nAnd later in cross-examination he gave this evidence:\nQ. Were you at all anxious or apprehensive as to the depth of water you might find there?\nA. I wasn't unduly concerned.\nQ. You don't sound sure. You were somewhat concerned?\nA. I was somewhat concerned.\nAnd later:\nQ. You had no difficulty getting the ship into that position where she could load?\nA. She was rubbing the bottom and we didn't try to move her.\nQ. Before you started completing your loading she was rubbing the bottom?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Where-forward or aft?\nA. Forward.\nQ. When you say the ship stopped herself, what do you mean by that?\nA. She came to a stop herself because the winch was having too much power.\nQ. You didn't have to use your engines after she had gone forward?\nA. No.\nQ. Were you surprised she had gone aground forward?\nA. Not necessarily.\nOn consideration of all the evidence I have reached the opinion that the motivating concern in the minds of those in charge of the Algoway was to load as much wheat as her winter draft would allow and that the possibility of the ship taking ground in the process was a secondary consideration.\nAs I agree with the learned trial judge that no reliance was placed on the inaccurate data supplied in the Lakehead pamphlet and as I am of opinion that the conversation between the mate and the superintendent was of too casual a nature to justify moving the Algoway into a position where it should have been known to those in charge that she was likely to be resting on the rocky bottom of the lake, I can find no negligence on the part of either of the respondents which was causative of the grounding and consequent damage.\nIn view of the conclusion which I have reached on the evidence, I do not find it necessary to consider the question of whether Lakehead was an agency of the Crown to which the provisions of s. 11 of the Public Authorities Protection Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 318 apply and nothing herein contained is to be treated as adopting the reasoning of the learned trial judge in that regard.\nI would accordingly dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant, Algoma Central and Hudson Bay Ry.

No agreement was reached as to compensation. In the arbitration proceedings which followed pursuant to the Department of Highways Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 103, one McQ was appointed arbitrator by the Minister of Highways and one M, by the appellant. The arbitrators, together with H, the umpire appointed by them, convened and heard evidence and argument. The arbitrators were unable to reach an agreement and accordingly, pursuant to s. 26 of the Department of Highways Act requested that the amount of compensation be determined by the umpire who thereupon fixed the compensation at $25,000.\nBy originating notice, the appellant proceeded to set aside the award on the grounds that (1) the arbitrator McQ was disqualified by interest in that he, at the time of the arbitration, was acting as solicitor for the Minister of Highways and (2) the umpire was disqualified by interest in that, at the time of the arbitration, he was acting as crown counsel for the Province of British Columbia. On motion an order was made setting aside the award. On appeal the Court of Appeal, by a unanimous judgment, set aside the order of the judge of first instance and affirmed the award.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the order of the judge of first instance restored.\nThe arbitrator McQ was disqualified. From the beginning to the end of the arbitration he was retained by the respondent Minister in a dispute of the same nature as that which was the subject-matter of the arbitration; in that dispute the party whose land was required by the respondent was in no way connected with the appellant and the land expropriated was some 250 miles distant, but the disqualification arose from the circumstance that, unknown to the appellant, the confidential and mutually beneficial relationship of solicitor and client existed at all relevant times between McQ and the respondent. Assuming that the umpire H was in no way personally disqualified, the disqualification of McQ was fatal to the validity of the award. Sellar v. The Highland Railway Co., [1918] S.C. 838; [1919] S.C.

Wetmore, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[2] setting aside an order of Collins J. and affirming an award made in an arbitration between the parties.\nThe appellant was the owner of 7.226 acres of land in the City of Trail, British Columbia, expropriated by the Department of Highways. No agreement was reached as to compensation. In the arbitration proceedings which followed pursuant to the Department of Highways Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 103, Mr. C. D. McQuarrie, Q.C., was appointed arbitrator by the Minister of Highways and Mr. M. E. Moran, by the appellant. The arbitrators, together with Mr. D. B. Hinds, the umpire appointed by them, convened at the City of Trail in November 1963, and heard evidence and argument. The arbitrators were unable to reach an agreement and accordingly, pursuant to s. 26 of the Department of Highways Act, requested that the amount of compensation be determined by the umpire who on December 23, 1963, made an award fixing the compensation at $25,000.\nBy originating notice dated February 11, 1964, the appellant moved to set aside the award on the following grounds:\n1. The Arbitrator, Colin D. McQuarrie, Q.C., appointed by the Minister of Highways of the Province of British Columbia, was and is disqualified by interest in that he has been and was at the time of the arbitration referred to herein acting as solicitor or counsel or agent for the said Minister of Highways or the Department of Highways of the Province of British Columbia or both.\n2. The Umpire, D. B. Hinds, was and is disqualified by interest in that he has been and was at the time of the arbitration referred to herein acting as Crown Counsel for the Province of British Columbia.\nThe material before Collins J. consisted of five affidavits. There was no cross-examination on any of these and there is really no dispute as to the relevant facts.\nFrom time to time Mr. McQuarrie had acted for the Department of Highways and had also acted against that Department. Neither he nor any member of his firm had ever held a general retainer from the Department. Prior to being appointed arbitrator in the matter with which we are concerned Mr. McQuarrie was retained by the Minister of Highways to act as solicitor for the Department of Highways in the matter of an expropriation by the Department of a property situate near to Radium, British Columbia, and continued to be so retained throughout the period of the holding of the hearing in the arbitration and the making of the award in regard to the appellant's property.\nThese facts were not disclosed to the appellant or his solicitor and did not come to the notice of either of them until some time in January, 1964, after the appellant had received a copy of the award.\nMr. Hinds had never acted for the Department of Highways but from time to time had acted as counsel for the Crown in the right of British Columbia in criminal prosecutions. These facts also were unknown to the appellant and his solicitor until after the appellant had received a copy of the award.\nOn March 2, 1964, the motion came before Collins J. who set aside the award. He gave no recorded reasons for his decision but it is said in the reasons of Lord J.A. in the Court of Appeal that counsel were agreed that the judgment of Collins J. was:\nbased on a reasonable apprehension that the arbitrator appointed by the Minister might not act in an entirely impartial manner. There was no suggestion of actual bias, and it is common ground that he is a gentleman of integrity and high standing in his profession.\nIn the Court of Appeal, Sheppard J.A. was of opinion that there was no evidence to support a reasoned suspicion of bias on the part of Mr. McQuarrie. Lord J.A., with whom Davey J.A. was in substantial agreement, proceeded on the ground that the award was that of Mr. Hinds and not that of the Board of Arbitrators and so found it unnecessary to deal with the question whether Mr. McQuarrie was disqualified. With the greatest respect I am unable to agree with either of these views.\nThe applicable principles have recently been restated by Rand J. giving the unanimous judgment of this Court in Szilard v. Szasz[3] . At p. 4 he said:\nFrom its inception arbitration has been held to be of the nature of judicial determination and to entail incidents appropriate to that fact. The arbitrators are to exercise their function not as the advocates of the parties nominating them, and a fortiori of one party when they are agreed upon by all, but with as free, independent and impartial minds as the circumstances permit. In particular they must be untrammelled by such influences as to a fair minded person would raise a reasonable doubt of that impersonal attitude which each party is entitled to. This principle has found expression in innumerable cases, and a reference to a few of them seems desirable.\nRand J. then reviewed a number of decisions and continued at pp. 6 and 7:\nThese authorities illustrate the nature and degree of business and personal relationships which raise such a doubt of impartiality as enables a party to an arbitration to challenge the tribunal set up. It is the probability or the reasoned suspicion of biased appraisal and judgment, unintended though it may be, that defeats the adjudication at its threshold. Each party, acting reasonably, is entitled to a sustained confidence in the independence of mind of those who are to sit in judgment on him and his affairs.\n***\nNor is it that we must be able to infer that the arbitrator 'would not act in an entirely impartial manner'; it is sufficient if there is the basis for a reasonable apprehension of so acting.\nOne of the cases referred to with approval by Rand J. was Summer et al. v. Barnhill[4] , in which an award was set aside on the ground that one of the arbitrators was disqualified by the fact of having been regularly retained as solicitor of the estate of which the defendant was the executor, although he had not been engaged as counsel or attorney in the matter referred, and did not concur in the award. Sir William Young C.J. in delivering the judgment of the Court said at p. 505:\nThe modern cases are in Russell 101-3, affirming the general principle that an arbitrator ought to be a person who stands indifferent between the parties, and that any concealed or unknown interest or bias will disqualify him. The rule is well expressed in Kemp v.Rose, 1Giff., 258; 'a perfectly even and unbiased mind, said the Vice-Chancellor, is essential to the validity of every judicial proceeding. Therefore where it turns out that, unknown to one or both of the parties who submit to be bound by the decision of another, there was a circumstance in the situation of him to whom the decision was entrusted, which tended to produce a bias in his mind, the existence of that circumstance will justify the interference of the Court.' See also Harvey v. Shelton, 7 Beav. 462-4. It is of no consequence that Mr. Longworth has not joined in the award. He sat upon the reference and was there as a judge, and, without at all questioning the purity and conscientiousness of his action, I am of opinion, that, as the solicitor of Pearson's estate and the adviser of the executor quite independently of this case, he was not competent to act as one of the arbitrators thereon, and, the fact being unknown to the plaintiffs, their attorney and counsel, that the award should be set aside and the rule nisi made absolute with costs.\nIn the case at bar from the beginning to the end of the arbitration Mr. McQuarrie was retained by the respondent in a dispute of the same nature as that which was the subject-matter of the arbitration; the party whose land in Radium was required by the respondent was in no way connected with the appellant and the land expropriated was some 250 miles distant, but the disqualification arises from the circumstance that, unknown to the appellant, the confidential and mutually beneficial relationship of solicitor and client existed at all relevant times between Mr. McQuarrie and the respondent.\nLord J.A. relied in part on the decision of this Court in North Shore Railway Company v. The Reverend Ursuline Ladies of Quebec (1885) , which is briefly noted in Cassels Digest of Supreme Court Decisions at p. 36. An examination of the complete record of that case in this Court shews that the appeal was heard on March 4, 1885, and judgment reserved. On the following day judgment was given orally and the note in the Registrar's book reads as follows:\nIn the North Shore Railway Company v. The Ursulines of Quebec, the Chief Justice states there is no doubt that the judgment of the Court below was correct and the Court is of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nNo recorded reasons were delivered in either of the Courts below. The action was brought by the Ursulines of Quebec to recover from the Railway Company the amount awarded by a board of arbitrators as compensation for a piece of land taken by the Railway. The main defence was that Charlebois, the arbitrator appointed by the plaintiffs, was disqualified because since a date prior to the arbitra- tion he was \"le procureur agent\" of the plaintiffs, that he had always left the defendant in ignorance of this fact and this had prevented it from taking steps to have him removed as arbitrator. In answer the plaintiffs denied that Charlebois was disqualified and added that if he were it was the duty of the defendant to take steps to set aside his appointment before proceeding with the arbitration. In the plaintiff's factum filed in this Court it is stated that the appellant and its arbitrator knew the facts and never raised any objection and this allegation is supported by the evidence of Charlebois and also by that of Bertrand who was the arbitrator named by the defendant. In these circumstances I think it probable that the ground of the decision was that the defendant proceeded with the arbitration with knowledge of the facts which, after the award, it claimed disqualified Charlebois. There is no doubt that, generally speaking, an award will not be set aside if the circumstances alleged to disqualify an arbitrator were known to both parties before the arbitration commenced and they proceeded without objection.\nTurning to the main ground on which Lord J.A. proceeded, I am of opinion that, assuming that Mr. Hinds was in no way personally disqualified, the disqualification of Mr. McQuarrie was fatal to the validity of the award. On this point it is sufficient to refer to the judgments in Sellar v. The Highland Railway Company[5] . In this case it was held that an arbitrator was disqualified because he held some shares in the Railway Company and that by reason of this the award made by the oversman appointed by the arbitrators must be set aside. On appeal to the Inner House from the judgment of Lord Sands, Lord Johnston said at p. 853:\nThe disqualification here of the arbiter has had a somewhat exceptional result. It has not tainted his award, for he did not get the length of making one. It has vitiated his nomination of and devolution on the oversman. At first sight disqualification of the oversman may appear far-fetched. But I think, when the practice in the conduct of arbitrations, at least in Scotland, is remembered, that the propriety and justice of the judgment becomes apparent. By common, and I may say almost invariable, practice the arbiters nominate their oversman before commencing the work of the reference. As a pure matter of convenience, and to charge him with a knowledge of the matter at issue, and the considerations hinc inde, he accompanies them on any visit to the locus. He sits with them throughout the leading of evidence and hears the arguments addressed to them by counsel or agents. He is present at their deliberations. In point of fact he may not inaptly be described as the president of a Court of three, with a controlling voice in case of difference between subordinate colleagues. There can be no question that a man in such a position, should the decision of the question in dispute ultimately devolve upon him, is open to be swayed by the opinions and reasoning of either of those with whom he has thus sat, and therefore that there is substance and not merely form in carrying the objection to the arbiter to the length of vitiating the appointment of the oversman in which he has had a hand. The objection must have been sustained if the disqualification of the arbiter had been discovered before the devolution, and it is, I think, equally well founded, though the discovery does not take place till the devolution has been made, or even the oversman's award has been issued. The arbitration in question has therefore proved abortive,\nThis judgment was affirmed in the House of Lords. At p. 24 Lord Finlay said:\nIt follows that the decreet-arbitral cannot stand. It is perfectly true that the decreet-arbitral was not the work of Mr. Hogg, but Mr. Hogg did act as arbiter in the matter. Having this interest in the Highland Railway Co. he heard the evidence and arguments and he considered the matter, and he and the arbiter on the other side failed to come to agreement. It seems to me that in doing that Mr. Hogg did act judicially in the matter, and, inasmuch as the function of the oversman in deciding by decreet-arbitral was the result of the failure to agree by the arbiters, the decreet-arbitral cannot stand.\nThe principle of this decision appears to me to govern the case at bar.\nBefore parting with the matter it is scarcely necessary to add that no impropriety is imputed to Mr. McQuarrie whose integrity and high standing in the profession are unquestioned; but when circumstances exist which have the legal result of disqualification the award cannot stand. An outstanding illustration of the application of this rule is found in the well known case of Dimes v. Proprietors of the Grand Junction Canal et al.[6] , in which the House of Lords set aside a decree of the Lord Chancellor of England because he held some shares in the Canal Company although, as Lord Campbell said at p. 793, \"No one can suppose that Lord Cottenham could be, in the remotest degree, influenced by the interest that he had in this concern\". I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal and restore the order of Collins J. The appellant will recover from the respondent his costs in the Court of Appeal and in this Court such costs as are taxable in view of the circumstance that he conducted the appeal in person.\nAppeal allowed and the order of the judge of first instance restored.\nCharles Ghirardosi, appellant, on his own behalf.\nSolicitor for the respondent: A.

The appellant objected to the Minister's computation of his farming losses on the grounds: (1) that the interest paid on the mortgage which he gave as part of the purchase price of the farm, as well as the interest paid on bank loans for capital outlays on the farm, was properly deductible in computing his general income and should not have been deducted from the farm income; (2) that, if those payments had to be included in determining his farming losses, then the mortgage interest received in respect of a farm sold earlier should be included in computing his farming income; and (3) that the capital cost allowance granted in respect of the present farm should not be deducted in computing his farming losses but should be deducted in the computation of his general income. The Exchequer Court confirmed the assessment subject to certain adjustments consented to by the Minister. The taxpayer appealed to this Court where he raised the contention that because the Minister had not made a formal determination under s. 13(2) to the effect that his chief source of income was neither farming nor a combination of farming and some other sources of income, the provisions of s. 13(1) did not come into operation and, accordingly, either the appeal should be allowed in toto or the matter should be referred back to the Minister to make such a determination.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe Exchequer Court had been right in its conclusions and reasons for judgment.\nIn the absence of a determination by the Minister under s. 13(2), the Exchequer Court had jurisdiction to determine the question concerning the appellant's chief source of income. On the evidence, the only finding that could properly be made was that the appellant's chief source of income was neither farming nor a combination of farming and some other sources of income, which was the basis on which the Exchequer Court proceeded.\nRevenu\u2014Imp\u00f4t sur le revenu\u2014Pertes dues \u00e0 une exploitation agricole\u2014D\u00e9duction limit\u00e9e en vertu de I'art. 13(1) de la Loi de I'lmp\u00f4t sur le revenu, S.R.C. 1952, c. 148\u2014Aucune d\u00e9cision prise par le Ministre en vertu de I'art. 13(2).\nLe Ministre a limit\u00e9 sous le r\u00e9gime de I'art. 13(1) de la Loi de I'lmp\u00f4t sur le revenu, S.R.C. 1952, c. 148, les pertes dues \u00e0 une exploitation agricole encourues durant les ann\u00e9es de taxation 1957 \u00e0 1960 par I'appelant, le pr\u00e9sident d'une maison d'\u00e9dition qui exploitait aussi une ferme dont il \u00e9tait le propri\u00e9taire.

Ainslie and D.G.H. Bowman, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment1 of Cattanach J. allowing in part on consent an appeal by the appellant from the assessments made for his 1957, 1958, 1959 and 1960 taxation years and subject to the adjustments directed pursuant to such consent dismissing the appeal and confirming the assessments.\nAt the conclusion of the argument of counsel for the appellant the Court was unanimously in agreement with the conclusions and reasons of the learned trial judge and counsel for the respondent were called upon in regard to only one point which was not dealt with expressly by Cattanach J. but was fully argued in this Court.\nThat point, briefly stated, is as follows. The appellant submits that unless the Minister determines under s. 13 (2) of the Income Tax Act that a taxpayer's chief source of income for a taxation year is neither farming nor a combination of farming and some other source of income the provisions of subs. (1) of that section do not come into operation, and that, since the Minister did not make a determination under subs. (2), either the appeal should be allowed in toto or the matter should be referred back to the Minister to make such a determination. Section 13, as applicable to the taxation years 1958, 1959 and 1960 reads as follows:\n13. (1) Where a taxpayer's chief source of income for a taxation year is neither farming nor a combination of farming and some other source of income, his income for the year shall be deemed to be not less than his income from all sources other than farming minus the lesser of\n(a) his farming loss for the year, or\n(b) $2,500 plus the lesser of\n(i) one-half of the amount by which his farming loss for the year exceeds $2,500, or\n(ii) $2,500.\n(2) For the purpose of this section, the Minister may determine that a taxpayer's chief source of income for a taxation year is neither farming nor a combination of farming and some other source of income.\n(3) For the purposes of this section, 'farming loss' means a loss from farming computed by applying the provisions of this Act respecting the computation of income from a business mutatis mutandis.\nAs applicable to the taxation year 1957 there were, differences in the wording of subs. (1) which are not material to the point under discussion.\nBoth at the trial and before us counsel for the respondent conceded that in the case at bar the Minister did not make a determination under subs. (2).\nIn these circumstances we are all of opinion that the Exchequer Court had jurisdiction to determine the question whether the appellant's chief source of income for the taxation years with which the appeal is concerned was neither farming nor a combination of farming and some other source of income.\nOn the evidence given at the trial and the admissions made by counsel the only finding that could properly be made is that the appellant's chief source of income during the taxation years in question was neither farming nor a combination of farming and some other source of income and it was on that basis that the learned trial judge proceeded.\nFor the reasons given by Cattanach J. and those stated above I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: F.E.

Between the years 1949 and 1955, it purchased blocks of land on which merchantable timber was standing. The whole of the purchase price was paid for the timber itself. No value was assigned to the land apart from the timber, it being the custom and the intention of the appellant to let the land be sold for taxes after all the merchantable timber had been removed. In computing its income from year to year the appellant claimed deductions in an amount equal to the capital cost of the timber cut during the year. In 1957, the appellant accepted an offer to sell for $22,620 the lands in one of its logged-over limits. The 'Minister ruled that this sum was the proceeds of disposition of depreciable property and reduced the appellant's capital cost allowance claim accordingly. The appellant contended that the sum was a capital receipt or windfall from the sale of bare land which is not depreciable property under s. 1102(2) of the Regulations, and that there being no proceeds of disposition of depreciable property, section 20(5)(e) of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148, could not be applied to reduce the undepreciated capital cost of the timber limit. An appeal from the Minister's assessment was allowed by the Income Tax Appeal Board. On further appeal, the Exchequer Court reversed that decision and upheld the Minister's assessment. The taxpayer appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Ritchie J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Cartwright, Abbott, Judson and Spence JJ.: The $22,620 received by the appellant was the proceeds of a disposition of a depreciable property. When the lands were acquired by the appellant they were properly described as \"timber limits\" both in ordinary popular language and in the sense in which those words are used in the statutory provisions. The phrase \"timber limits\" describes a parcel of land with merchantable timber standing upon it; it is used in the Regulations in contradistinction to the phrase \"a right to cut timber from a limit\". Under the scheme of the relevant sections of the Act and of the Regulations, a timber limit is treated as a class of depreciable property; it is an asset the total capital cost of which the owner is entitled to deduct in calculating his income. It was impossible to accept the view that, when all the merchantable timber had been removed, the land that remained ceased to be a timber limit. The proceeds of disposition of that land fell within the terms of s. 20(1) of the Act and s. 1100(2) of the Regulations. In the present case, the appellant purchased the land in question as a capital asset to secure a supply of timber to be used in earning its income. The scheme of the legislation is to allow the taxpayer to deduct the whole of the net cost of such capital asset in arriving at its trading profits. The judgment of the Exchequer Court brought about this result. If, on the other hand, the contentions of the appellant were upheld, the result would be that it would have been permitted to deduct the total original cost of the capital asset although it had already recovered $22,620 of that cost.\nPer Ritchie J., dissenting: For the purpose of schedule C \"a timber limit\" or \"a right to cut timber from a limit\" are to be deemed to belong to a class in which capital cost allowance is limited to the value of the timber cut during a taxation year and in which the land on which the timber stands is not included. The phrase \"timber limit\", as used in schedule C to connote the property in respect of which a taxpayer is entitled to a deduction, means \"merchantable timber within defined limits\". Land stripped of timber is not \"property in respect of which a taxpayer has been allowed or is entitled to a deduction under regulations made under s. 11(1)(a) of the Act\". That land is not \"depreciable property of a taxpayer\" within the meaning of s. 20(5) (a) of the Act. Therefore, the proceeds of disposition of the land here in question were not proceeds of a disposition of depreciable property.\nRevenu\u2014Imp\u00f4t sur le revenu\u2014Vente d'une concession foresti\u00e8re apr\u00e8s que le bois a \u00e9t\u00e9 enlev\u00e9\u2014Est-ce une disposition de biens susceptibles de d\u00e9pr\u00e9ciation\u2014Co\u00fbt en capital \u00e0 titre d'allocation\u2014Co\u00fbt en capital non d\u00e9pr\u00e9ci\u00e9\u2014Loi de l'Imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, S.R.C. 1952, c. 148, arts. 11(1)(a) , (b) , 20(1) , 20(5) (a) , (c) , (e)\u2014R\u00e8glements de l'Imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, arts. 1100(1)(e) , 1100(2) , 1101(3)(a) , (b) , 1102( (2) , C\u00e9dule C.\nLa compagnie appelante s'occupait de la coupe de bois et poss\u00e9dait des moulins sur l'\u00eele de Vancouver. Entre 1949 et 1955, elle a achet\u00e9 des terres sur lesquelles il y avait du bois sur pied en \u00e9tat d'\u00eatre livr\u00e9 au commerce. Tout le prix d'achat portait sur le bois lui-m\u00eame.

Dans le calcul de son revenu de chaque ann\u00e9e, l'appelante r\u00e9clamait des d\u00e9ductions pour un montant \u00e9gal au co\u00fbt en capital du bois coup\u00e9 durant l'ann\u00e9e. En 1957, l'appelante a accept\u00e9 une offre de vendre pour $22,620 une de ses terres dont elle avait enlev\u00e9 le bois. Le Ministre a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que ce montant \u00e9tait le produit d'une disposition de biens susceptibles de d\u00e9pr\u00e9ciation et a r\u00e9duit, en cons\u00e9quence, l'allocation du co\u00fbt en capital de l'appelante. L'appelante a soumis que le montant \u00e9tait un re\u00e7u en capital ou une aubaine provenant de la vente d'une terre d\u00e9nud\u00e9e qui n'est pas un bien susceptible de d\u00e9pr\u00e9ciation en vertu de l'art. 1102(2) des R\u00e8glements, et comme il n'y avait pas eu de produit d'une disposition de biens susceptibles de d\u00e9pr\u00e9ciation, on ne pouvait pas se servir de l'art. 20(5) de la Loi sur l'Imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, S.R.C. 1952, c. 148, pour r\u00e9duire le co\u00fbt en capital non d\u00e9pr\u00e9ci\u00e9 de la concession foresti\u00e8re.

Lorsque l'appelante a acquis les terres, celles-ci \u00e9taient proprement d\u00e9crites comme \u00e9tant des \u00ab concessions foresti\u00e8res \u00bb et dans le langage ordinaire populaire et dans le sens dans lequel ces mots sont employ\u00e9s dans les dispositions statutaires. Les mots \u00ab concessions foresti\u00e8res \u00bb d\u00e9crivent un lopin de terre sur lequel il y a du bois sur pied en \u00e9tat d'\u00eatre livr\u00e9 au commerce; ces mots sont employ\u00e9s dans les R\u00e8glements par contraste avec la phrase \u00ab le droit de couper le bois d'une concession \u00bb. Sous le syst\u00e8me des articles pertinents de la Loi et des R\u00e8glements, une concession foresti\u00e8re est trait\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant une classe de biens susceptibles de d\u00e9pr\u00e9ciation; c'est un bien duquel le propri\u00e9taire a droit de d\u00e9duire le co\u00fbt total en capital dans le calcul de son revenu. Il est impossible d'accepter le point de vue que la terre qui subsiste apr\u00e8s que le bois en \u00e9tat d'\u00eatre livr\u00e9 au commerce a \u00e9t\u00e9 enlev\u00e9, cesse d'\u00eatre une concession foresti\u00e8re.

Appel rejet\u00e9, le Juge Ritchie \u00e9tant dissident.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Dumoulin J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada[2], allowing an appeal from a decision of the Income Tax Appeal Board. Appeal dismissed, Ritchie J. dissenting.\nKenneth E. Meredith, for the appellant.\nG. W. Ainslie, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Cartwright, Abbott, Judson and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment[3] of Dumoulin J. allowing an appeal from a decision of the Tax Appeal Board and restoring the re-assessment of tax in the sum of $14,758.97 for the appellant's 1957 taxation year.\nThe appellant carried on the business of logging and milling on Vancouver Island.\nBetween the years 1949 and 1955 the appellant purchased from the Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway Company, blocks of land on which merchantable timber was standing. In each case the appellant acquired an estate in fee simple subject to a reservation of mineral rights and other reservations not material to the question raised in this appeal. The purchase price of each block was based on cruises made by the vendor and purchaser assigning prices to the various kinds of standing timber on the land pur- chased. No value was assigned to the land apart from the timber, it being the custom and the intention of the appellant to let the land be sold for taxes after all the merchantable timber had been removed.\nIn computing its income from year to year the appellant claimed deductions in an amount equal to the capital cost of the timber cut during the year from the lands above referred to.\nIn 1957 Alaska Pine and Cellulose Company Limited, hereinafter referred to as \"Alaska Pine\", offered to purchase these lands from the appellant, its intention being to use them as a tree farm. The appellant accepted the offer which it regarded as a windfall. The appellant conveyed the lands to Alaska Pine in fee simple but reserved to itself the right to cut and remove all the merchantable timber standing, lying or being upon the said lands. Prior to the end of the appellant's taxation year on September 30, 1957, it removed all this timber.\nIt is agreed that the net proceeds from the sale of the land to Alaska Pine amounted to $22,620. In his notice of re-assessment the respondent added this amount to the appellant's income for 1957 by an item worded as follows:\nReduction of Capital Cost Allowance claimed in 1957 on Blocks 871, 891, 1035 and 1069, and a partial recovery of Capital Cost Allowance on blocks previously shown as depleted. Sold March 4, 1957, for $22,620.00.\nThe appellant served a notice of objection to the reassessment. As to this item the objection was rejected by the Minister who stated in his notification that the reassessment in respect of this item was made in accordance with the provisions of the Income Tax Act and in particular:\non the ground that the proceeds of disposition of depreciable property sold to Alaska Pine Company Limited pursuant to an Agreement dated 4th March, 1957 was $22,620.00 in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (c) of sub-section (5) of section 20 of the Act and therefore for the purpose of paragraph (2) of subsection (1) of section 11 of the Act and paragraph (e) of sub-section (1) of section 1100 of the Income Tax Regulations the undepreciated capital cost of the taxpayer's timber limits and rights to cut timber has been properly determined. The appellant served a notice of appeal to the Tax Appeal Board. Paragraph 10 of the reply to this notice reads as follows:\nThe Respondent pleads and relies upon the provisions of sections 11(1) (a) and 20(5) of the Income Tax Act and sections 1100(1) (e), 1101(3) and 1105 and Schedule C of the Income Tax Regulations.\nThere is no dispute as to amounts or as to the material facts. The question is whether or not on the true construction of the applicable sections of the Income Tax Act and Regulations this addition of $22,620 to the income of the appellant was properly made.\nIn the reasons of the Tax Appeal Board it is said:\nEven if I were to accept a definition of a timber limit as including not only the timber but also the land, nevertheless it is my conviction that land is not depreciable property and that the proceeds from the sale of the land cannot be brought into income for the purposes of taxation under the provisions of s. 20 of the Act or any of the Income Tax Regulations.\nThe reasons conclude as follows:\nIn any event, I have reached the conclusion that the respondent erred in the assessment appealed against in attempting to tax the proceeds from the sale of land as being applicable to the disposition of depreciable property, when, on the evidence before me, there was no depreciable property whatsoever involved in the sale by the appellant to Alaska Pine Company Limited.\nDumoulin J. was of opinion that the lands acquired by the appellant in fee simple and disposed of by it to Alaska Pine were \"timber limits\" within the meaning of Schedule C of the Income Tax Regulations and \"depreciable property\" in respect of which the appellant had been allowed a deduction under regulations made under s. 11(1) (a) of the Income Tax Act\nIt is common ground that the blocks of land with the merchantable timber standing on them were acquired by the appellant as capital assets. It was pointed out by Locke J. in Caine Lumber Co. Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue[4] , that:\nThe provisions of s. 11 of the Act and of the Regulations are required in order to afford a means of properly ascertaining the trading profit of persons engaged in such businesses as mining and lumbering, where capital assets are depleted by the operations. The sections of the Act and Regulations with which we are chiefly concerned are:\nSection 11(1) (a) and (b):\n11 (1) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a), (b) and (h) of subsection (1) of section 12, the following amounts may be deducted in computing the income of a taxpayer for a taxation year:\n(a) such part of the capital cost to the taxpayer of property, or such amount in respect of the capital cost to the taxpayer of property, if any, as is allowed by regulation;\n(b) such amount as an allowance in respect of an oil or gas well, mine or timber limit, if any, as is allowed to the taxpayer by regulation;\nSection 12(1) (b):\n12 (1) In computing income, no deduction shall be made in respect of\n***\n(b) an outlay, loss or replacement of capital, a payment on account of capital or an allowance in respect of depreciation, obsolescence or depletion except as expressly permitted by this Part,\nSection 20 (1):\n20 (1) Where depreciable property of a taxpayer of a prescribed class has, in a taxation year, been disposed of and the proceeds of disposition exceed the undepreciated capital cost to him of depreciable property of that class immediately before the disposition, the lesser of\n(a) the amount of the excess, or\n(b) the amount that the excess would be if the property had been disposed of for the capital cost thereof to the taxpayer,\nshall be included in computing his income for the year.\nSection 20 (5), so far as relevant reads:\n(5) In this section and regulations made under paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of section 11,\n(a) 'depreciable property of a taxpayer' as of any time in a taxation year means property in respect of which the taxpayer has been allowed, or is entitled to, a deduction under regulations made under paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of section 11, in computing income for that or a previous taxation year;\n(b) 'disposition of property' includes any transaction or event entitling a taxpayer to proceeds of disposition of property;\n(c) 'proceeds of disposition' of property include\n(i) the sale price of property that has been sold, \u2026\n(clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv) are not applicable.)\n(d) 'total depreciation allowed to a taxpayer' before any time for property of a prescribed class means the aggregate of all amounts allowed to the taxpayer in respect of property of that class under regulations made under paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of section 11 in computing income for taxation years before that time; and (e) 'undepreciated capital cost to a taxpayer of depreciable property' of a prescribed class as of any time means the capital cost to the taxpayer of depreciable property of that class acquired before that time minus the aggregate of\n(i) the total depreciation allowed to the taxpayer for property of that class before that time,\n(ii) for each disposition before that time of property of the taxpayer of that class, the least of\n(A) the proceeds of disposition thereof,\n(B) the capital cost to him thereof, or\n(C) the undepreciated capital cost to him of property of that class immediately before the disposition, and\n(iii) each amount by which the undepreciated capital cost to the taxpayer of depreciable property of that class as of the end of a previous year was reduced by virtue of subsection (2).\nRegulations, Section 1100(1)(e):\n1100(1) Under paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of section 11 of the Act, there is hereby allowed to a taxpayer, in computing his income from a business or property, as the case may be, deductions for each taxation year equal to \u2026\n(e) such amount as he may claim not exceeding the amount calculated in accordance with Schedule C in respect of the capital cost to him of a timber limit or a right to cut timber from a limit;\nRegulations, Section 1100(2):\n(2) Where a taxpayer has, in a taxation year, otherwise than on death, disposed of all property of a prescribed class that he had not previously disposed of and has no property of that class at the end of the taxation year, he is hereby allowed a deduction for the year equal to the amount that would otherwise be the undepreciated capital cost to the taxpayer of property of that class at the expiration of the taxation year.\nRegulations, Section 1101 (3) (a) and (b):\n(3) For the purpose of this Part and for the purpose of Schedules C and D,\n(a) a timber limit or a right to cut timber from a limit shall be deemed to be a separate class of property, and\n(b) where a taxpayer has more than one timber limit or rights to cut timber from more than one limit, each limit or right shall be deemed to be a separate class of property.\nSchedule C reads as follows:\nSchedule C\n1. For the purpose of paragraph (e) of subsection (1) of section 1100, the amount that may be deducted in computing the income of a taxpayer for a taxation year in respect of a timber limit or a right to cut timber from a limit is the lesser of (a) an amount computed on the basis of a rate (computed under section 2 of this Schedule) per cord or board foot cut in the year,\nor\n(b) the undepreciated capital cost to the taxpayer as of the end of the year (before making any deduction under section 1100 for the year) of the timber or right.\n2. The rate for a taxation year is\n(a) if the taxpayer has not been granted an allowance in respect of the limit or right for a previous year, an amount determined by dividing the capital cost of the limit or right to the taxpayer minus the residual value by the quantity of timber in the limit or the quantity of timber the taxpayer has obtained a right to cut, as the case may be (expressed in cords or board feet) as shown by a bona fide cruise, and\n(b) if the taxpayer has been granted an allowance in respect of the limit or right in a previous year,\n(i) if no rate has been determined under subparagraph (ii), the rate employed to determine the allowance for the most recent year for which an allowance was granted, and\n(ii) where it has been established that the quantity of timber that was in the limit or that the taxpayer had a right to cut was in fact substantially different from the quantity that was employed in determining the rate for the previous year, or where it has been established that the capital cost of the limit or right was substantially different from the amount that was employed in determining the rate for the previous year, a rate determined by dividing the undepreciated capital cost to the taxpayer of the limit or right as of the commencement of the year minus the residual value thereof by the estimated remaining quantity of timber that is in the limit or that the taxpayer has a right to cut, as the case may be (expressed in cords or board feet) at the commencement of the year.\n3. In lieu of the deduction otherwise determined under this Schedule, a taxpayer may elect that the deduction for a taxation year be the lesser of\n(a) $100, or\n(b) the amount received by him in the taxation year from the sale of timber.\n4. In this Schedule, 'residual value' means the estimated value of the property if the merchantable timber were removed.\nWhile in view of these somewhat complex statutory provisions it may seem an over-simplification, it appears to me that the result of this appeal depends upon whether the sum of $22,620 received by the appellant in its 1957 taxation year for the lands from which the merchantable timber had been removed was the proceeds of a disposition of depreciable property of the appellant within the meaning of the provisions quoted above. In order to be brought within the terms of Regulation 1100(1) (e) and Schedule C the lands with which we are concerned must answer one or other of the descriptions \"a timber limit\" or \"a right to cut timber from a limit\". I think it plain that when those lands were acquired by the appellant they were properly described as \"timber limits\" both in ordinary popular language and in the sense in which those words are used in the statutory provisions. In my opinion, the phrase \"timer limits\" describes a parcel of land with merchantable timber standing upon it. It refers, that is to say, to a corporeal hereditament. The phrase \"a timber limit\" is used in Regulation 1100 (i) (e), Regulation 1101(3) (a) and (b), and Schedule C in contradistinction to the phrase \"a right to cut timber from a limit\", which is one apt to describe a profit \u00e0 prendre.\nA timber limit under the scheme of the relevant sections of the Act and Regulations is treated as a class of depreciable property; it is an asset the total capital cost of which the owner is entitled to deduct in calculating his taxable income. Without these statutory provisions the owner would have no right to make such deductions from income. The right to make the deductions is subject to the obligation, if he disposes of the asset, to add to his income the proceeds of that disposition to the extent that such proceeds do not exceed the capital cost to him. I am unable to accept the view that when all the merchantable timber had been removed the land which remained ceased to be a timber limit, and, in my opinion, the proceeds of the disposition of that land fall within the terms of s. 20(1) of the Income Tax Act and of Regulation 1100(2).\nThe answer to the question what tax is payable in any given circumstances depends, of course, upon the words of the legislation imposing it. Where the meaning of those words is difficult to ascertain it may be of assistance to consider which of two constructions contended for brings about a result which conforms to the apparent scheme of the legislation. In the present case the appellant purchased the land in question as a captial asset to secure a supply of timber to be used in earning its income. The scheme of the legislation is to allow the taxpayer to deduct the whole of the net cost of such capital asset in arriving at its trading profit. The judgment of the Exchequer Court in this case brings about this result. If, on the other hand, the contention of the appellant was upheld the result would be that it would have been permitted to deduct the total original cost of the capital asset although it had already recovered $22,620 of that cost.\nFor the reasons stated above and for those given by Dumoulin J., with which I am in substantial agreement, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nRITCHIE J. (dissenting) :I have had the advantage of reading the reasons for judgment of my brother Cartwright which are concurred in by the other members of the Court and in which he has outlined the circumstances giving rise to this appeal and has reproduced the relevant provisions of the Income Tax Act and regulations.\nThe following facts appear to me to be undisputed :\n1. The capital cost to the appellant of the timber limits in question was determined exclusively by reference to the extent and quality of the standing timber and no value whatever was assigned to the land.\n2. \"The undepreciated capital cost\" of the property so acquired immediately before March 4, 1957, was $49,379.90.\n3. On March 4, 1957, the land excluding timber was sold by the appellant to Alaska Pine and Cellulose Company Limited for a net return of $22,620.\n4. In computing its income for the 1957 taxation year, the appellant deducted $45,411.42 as a capital cost allowance in respect of the timber cut from the limits during that year.\n5. By notice of reassessment dated January 3, 1960, the Minister of National Revenue reassessed the capital cost allowance so claimed by subtracting therefrom the proceeds of the disposition of the land (i.e. $22,620) thus leaving the maximum amount deductible by way of capital cost allowance at a figure of $26,759.30 instead of $49,379.90 6. The timber limits in question were acquired by the appellant for the purpose of removing merchantable timber therefrom and were of no further use to it after the timber had been removed.\nThe question to be determined on this appeal is whether, in computing his taxable income for a taxation year, a taxpayer who owns a timber limit is required to deduct the sale price of land exclusive of timber from the \"undepreciated capital cost\" of the limit at the date of sale and this in turn depends, as Mr. Justice Cartwright has pointed out, upon whether such a sale constitutes \"a disposition of depreciable property\" within the meaning of these words as they are used in the Income Tax Act.\nFor greater clarity, and notwithstanding the fact that the subsections have been reproduced by my brother Cartwright, I think it desirable to set out the portions of the Income Tax Act which define \"depreciable property of a taxpayer\" and \"undepreciated capital cost to a taxpayer of depreciable property\".\n20. (5) In this section and regulations made under paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of section 11,\n(a) 'depreciable property of a taxpayer' as of any time in a taxation year means property in respect of which the taxpayer has been allowed or is entitled to, a deduction under regulations made under paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of section 11 in computing income for that or a previous taxation year; \u2026\n(e) 'undepreciated capital cost to a taxpayer of depreciable property' of a prescribed class of any time means the capital cost to the taxpayer of depreciable property of that class acquired before that time minus the aggregate of\n(i) the total depreciation allowed to the taxpayer for property of that class before that time,\n(ii) for each disposition before that time of property of the taxpayer of that class, the least of\n(A) the proceeds of disposition thereof,\n(B) the capital cost to him thereof, of\n(C) the undepreciated capital cost to him of property of that class immediately before the disposition and\n(iii) each amount by which the undepreciated capital cost to the taxpayer of depreciable property of that class as of the end of a previous year was reduced by virtue of subsection (2).\nIn determining the \"undepreciated capital cost to a taxpayer of depreciable property\" the taxpayer can only be required to subtract from the capital cost of the property such items as are specified in s. 20(5) (e) and it is clear from the terms of his confirmation of the present reassessment that the Minister has treated the sale price of the land, excluding timber, sold by the appellant on March 4, 1957, as being \"the proceeds of disposition\" of \"depreciable property of a prescribed class\" within the meaning of s. 20(1) and s. 20(5) (e) (ii) (A).\nThe \"prescribed class\" of depreciable property here in question is a \"timber limit\" and the property of that class \"in respect of which the taxpayer \u2026is entitled to a deduction \u2026\" is prescribed by the provisions of Schedule C 1, so that it is a matter of first importance to determine the meaning to be attached to the phrase \"timber limit\" as it occurs in that Schedule. There does not appear to me to be any difficulty about the meaning of the word \"limit\" and I take it to be plain that the phrase means the \"timber within defined limits or boundaries\". The question which remains to be determined, however, is what meaning Parliament intended to be attached to the word \"timber\" in the context. The provisions of Schedule C 1 read as follows:\nSchedule C\n(1) For the purpose of paragraph (e) of subsection (1) of section 1100, the amount that may be deducted in computing the income of a taxpayer for a taxation year in respect of a timber limit or a right to cut timber from a limit is the lesser of\n(a) an amount computed on the basis of a rate (computed under section 2 of this Schedule) per cord or board foot cut in the year, or\n(b) the undepreciated capital cost to the taxpayer as of the end of the year (before making any deduction under section 1100 for the year) of the timber or right.\nAt common law in the consideration of deeds and other documents of title \"timber\" is generally treated as connoting growing trees which are a part of the realty and pass with a conveyance of land unless expressly reserved. In this sense the word is defined in the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary as meaning \"trees growing upon land and form- ing part of the freehold inheritance\" but growing trees are potentially severable from the land and when severed and reduced to logs and lumber they become personal property and have a value as \"merchantable timber\" altogether apart from the land and the Oxford English Dictionary also defines \"timber\" as being \"applied to the wood of growing trees capable of being used for structural purposes hence collectively to the trees themselves.\"\nIt appears to me that the word \"timber\" as used in the phrase \"timber limit\" in Schedule C 1 is to be taken as meaning the kind of \"timber\" which is made the subject of the deduction allowed by that Schedule and in this regard it is significant that the deduction is not to be computed on the basis of timber as part of the corporeal hereditament but rather \"on the basis of a rate per cord or board foot cut in the year\" in which sense it seems to me that it must refer to the timber in growing trees capable of being severed from the land and being reduced to \"cord or board foot\" measure and not to growing trees together with the land on which they grow. In this sense the man who has a \"right to cut timber from a limit\" and the man who has acquired the land itself for the purpose of removing timber from it and has no further use for it have both acquired the same class of property, namely, \"the wood in the growing trees\" and with the greatest respect for those who hold a different view, I read regulation 1101(3) as reinforcing this view. The regulation reads:\n1101.\n(3) For the purpose of this Part and for the purpose of Schedules C and D,\n(a) a timber limit or a right to cut timber from a limit shall be deemed to be a separate class of property, and \u2026\nUnlike the other members of the Court, I take this to mean that for the purpose of Schedule C \"a timber limit\" or \"a right to cut timber from a limit\" are to be deemed to belong to the same separate class of property and that they belong to a class in which capital cost allowance is limited to the value of the timber which is cut during a taxation year and in which the land on which the timber stands is not included. For these reasons I have concluded that the phrase \"timber limit\" as used in Schedule C 1 to connote the property in respect of which the taxpayer is entitled to a deduction means \"merchantable timber within defined limits\", and I am accordingly of opinion that land stripped of timber is not \"property in respect of which a taxpayer has been allowed or is entitled to a deduction under regulations made under para. (a) of ss. (1) of s. 11 \u2026\" and is therefore not \"depreciable property of a taxpayer\" within the meaning of s. 20 (5) (a). It follows in my view that the proceeds of disposition of the land here in question were not proceeds of disposition of depreciable property within the meaning of s. 20(5) (e)or s. 20(1) and that the land was not property \"of a prescribed class\" within the meaning of 1100(2).\nHaving reached this conclusion, I am unable to find any authority in the Income Tax Act to justify the Minister in taking the proceeds of the sale of this land into consideration in determining the undepreciated capital cost of the timber limit in question for the purpose of computing the taxpayer's taxable income for the year 1957.\nFor these reasons I would allow this appeal and restore the judgment of the Tax Appeal Board.\nI appreciate that, as pointed out by my brother Cart-wright, the result of this decision is that the taxpayer would be allowed to deduct the total original cost of the timber limit notwithstanding the fact that it had sold the land on which the timber stood for $22,620. Unlike the other members of the Court, I do not regard this as a result which runs contrary to the expressed intention of Parliament but I am, on the other hand, of opinion that it would require an amendment to the statute in order to include land stripped of timber in the prescribed class of depreciable property for which provision is made in Schedule C 1. The fact that the appellant had made an unexpected sale of cut-over barren lands which it was prepared to abandon is, in my opinion, a circumstance of a kind sometimes referred to in this context as a \"windfall\" and, with great respect for those who hold a different view, it appears to me to fall clear of what Mr. Justice Dumoulin has referred to as the \"rather intricate statutory skein\" presently supplied by those provisions of the Income Tax Act which are fully set out in the reasons for judgment of my brother Cartwright.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, RITCHIE J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Meredith, Marshall, McConnell & Scott, Vancouver.\nSolicitor for the respondent: E.

The only issue raised by the defence at trial was that the jury should make a recommendation in favour of clemency. Defence counsel's whole address to the jury was devoted to this issue. The trial judge made no reference to it in his address to the jury before they retired to consider the verdict, but after the verdict of guilty had been rendered, he addressed the jury on s. 642A of the Code and read them a summary of the evidence of one psychiatrist. The jury returned an eleven to one recommendation against clemency. The appeal against sentence and conviction was dismissed by a unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal. An appeal was launched to this Court.\nBefore this Court and the Court of Appeal, the appellant argued that there had been a miscarriage of justice in that:\n(1) The trial judge failed to explain adequately to the jury the considerations that they could apply in arriving at a decision on the question of clemency;\n(2) The trial judge erred in failing to define and explain what clemency is, and the extent of the right that the jury had to recommend it;\n(3) The trial judge erred by directing the jury on the evidence given by only one of the witnesses on that issue.\nIn this Court, the Crown raised the question of jurisdiction on the ground that the appeal referred not to the conviction but to the question of sentence.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia,[1] affirming a conviction for capital murder.

D Ltd. owed the bank $20,000 on a demand loan and about $28,400 by way of overdraft. M Ltd. owed the bank $20,000 on a demand loan but had a credit balance of something over $4,000 in its current account.\nFollowing the signing of the guarantees the bank refused to honour outstanding cheques of D Ltd. unless cash were deposited to cover them, although up to that time the account had been allowed to become overdrawn. Four days after the signing of the guarantees the bank transferred $5,000 from the account of M Ltd. in part payment of the demand loan, thereby reducing that loan to $15,000 and creating an overdraft in the account of close to $900. On April 23 the bank's manager told the defendant that the bank would not advance further moneys to either D Ltd. or M Ltd. on the basis of the security that had been offered by the defendant. On April 24 the bank demanded payment in full of the indebtedness of the two companies and on April 27 demanded payment thereof from the defendant under the guarantees.\nAfter some days of discussion an arrangement was completed by May 12, 1959, whereby the bank was provided with certain additional security and in return agreed to a postponement of payment until April 29, 1960. However, payment was not made and an action on the two guarantees was commenced on January 11, 1961. The trial judgment in favour of the bank was affirmed by the Court of Appeal with one member of the Court dissenting. On the appeal to this Court one ground of defence required consideration, i.e., that it was a condition precedent to the defendant's liability on the guarantees that the plaintiff should carry out its agreement to deal with D Ltd. and M Ltd. as its customers in the way of its business as a bank, that the plaintiff did not carry out those agreements, and indeed never intended to do so, and that consequently the defendant who received no part of the consideration for his promises was under no liability.\nHeld (Judson J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed. Per Cartwright, Martland, Ritchie and Hall JJ.: The intention of the bank, far from being to deal with D Ltd. and M Ltd. as customers, was to terminate that relationship immediately upon receiving the guarantees and by April 24, 1959, it had done so. The arrangement completed on May 12, 1959, did not alter this position in favour of the bank. It was the case of a creditor pressing its debtors for payment of the balances due at the time when it had, for all practical purposes, put an end to its relationship of banker and customer with them and agreeing to give an extension of time for payment on the furnishing of additional securities. It did not constitute a bona fide fresh transaction between the parties as banker and customer. The bank did not grant an extension of time for payment by the two debtor companies as consideration for the obtaining of the guarantees from the defendant. What it did do was to demand and obtain additional security as the price for postponement of the enforcement of its claim for payment.\nThe defendant's letter wherein he acknowledged that the acquisition of additional securities by the bank was \"in no way\" to affect his liability as guarantor did not assist the plaintiff. Its purpose was to retain matters in statu quo. It neither increased nor diminished the liability of the defendant. The liability did not exist.\nRoyal Bank of Canada v. Salvatori, [1928] 3 W.W.R. 501, applied.\nPer Judson J., dissenting: The guarantee by its express terms was a continuing guarantee and it was in existence at the time of the settlement. The settlement provided that the taking of the additional security was not to affect the defendant's liability as guarantor of the two companies. A binding extension of time given to the two companies was within the consideration recited in the guarantee.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], affirming a judgment of Aikins J. Appeal allowed, Judson J. dissenting.\nI. Sara, for the defendant, appellant.\nV. R. Hill, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of Cartwright, Martland, Ritchie and Hall JJ. was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[2] affirming a judgment of Aikins J. in favour of the respondent for $76,305.16. Bull J.A., dissenting, would have allowed the appeal and dismissed the action.\nThe action was brought on two guarantees signed and sealed by the appellant. It was commenced on January 11, 1961, by specially endorsed writ. The first paragraph of the endorsement reads as follows:\nThe Plaintiff's claim against the Defendant is for the sum of $49,392.76 plus interest at the rate of 6% per annum on the sum of $45,169.84 from the 9th day of January, 1961 until payment or Judgment, being the balance and accrued interest due and owing by the Defendant to the Plaintiff under an unlimited guarantee in writing under seal dated the 10th day of April, 1959 signed by the Defendant and given by him to the Plaintiff in consideration of the Plaintiff agreeing to deal with Dunsmuir Construction Ltd. in the way of the Plaintiff's business as a bank.\nThe second paragraph is in the same words except that the name of \"Modern Aluminum Ltd.\" appears instead of \"Dunsmuir Construction Ltd.,\" and the amounts of $17,476.03 and $15,769.85 appear instead of $49,392.76 and $45,169.84.\nAt the trial there was direct conflict between the evidence of the appellant and that of Mr. Summers who was the manager of the branch of the respondent bank at which the transactions out of which the action arises took place. The learned trial judge preferred to accept the evidence of Mr. Summers. His findings of fact were accepted by all the judges in the Court of Appeal and were not challenged before us. In the result there is now only one ground of defence to the action which requires consideration.\nThe facts as found are set out in the reasons of the learned trial judge and in those of Bull J.A. I shall endeavour to state them as briefly as is consistent with making clear the reasons for the conclusion at which I have arrived.\nIn the spring of 1959 Haro Holdings Ltd., hereinafter referred to as \"Haro\", was building an apartment house in Vancouver. Dunsmuir Construction Ltd., hereinafter referred to as \"Dunsmuir\", was the construction contractor and Modern Aluminum Ltd., hereinafter referred to as \"Modern Aluminum\", was the supplier of aluminium materials to Dunsmuir for use in the building. These three companies banked with the respondent at its Columbia and Hastings Streets Branch. All three were short of working capital and were indebted to the bank. In early April 1959 Dunsmuir owed the bank about $28,400 by way of overdraft and $20,000 on a demand loan and Modern Aluminum owed the bank $20,000 on a demand loan but had a credit balance in its current account of $4,133.44. At this time the appellant was engaged in negotiations looking to obtaining control of the three companies.\nThe appellant met with Summers on April 9 and 10, 1959. As to what occurred at these meetings the learned trial judge accepted the evidence of Summers which he summarized as follows:\nThere was some discussion as to the bank advancing $75,000.00 to Dunsmuir and Modern Aluminum. Mr. Summers asked for the defendant's personal guarantees, the defendant agreed to give guarantees and he signed the guarantees without the bank making any commitment to make further loans to Dunsmuir or Modern Aluminum.\nThe two guarantees were signed on April 10, 1959. They were on printed forms prepared by the bank. The opening paragraph of that relating to Dunsmuir reads as follows:\nIn consideration of the bank's agreeing to deal with Dunsmuir Construction Ltd. (hereinafter called 'the customer') in the way of its business as a bank, the undersigned hereby guarantees payment to the bank of the liabilities whether direct, contingent or otherwise which the customer has incurred or is under or may hereafter incur or be under to the bank, whether arising from dealings between the bank and the customer, or from other dealings or proceedings by which the bank may become in any manner whatever a creditor of the customer.\nThe guarantee relating to Modern Aluminum is the same except that \"the customer\" is Modern Aluminum Ltd. instead of Dunsmuir Construction Ltd.\nFollowing the signing of the guarantees the bank refused to honour outstanding cheques of Dunsmuir unless cash were deposited to cover them, although up to that time the account had been allowed to become overdrawn. Four days after the signing of the guarantees the bank transferred $5,000 from the account of Modern Aluminum in part payment of the demand loan, thereby reducing that loan to $15,000 and creating an overdraft in the account of $866.56. On April 23 Summers told the respondent that the bank would not advance further moneys to either Dunsmuir or Modern Aluminum on the basis of the security that had been offered by the appellant. On April 24 the bank demanded payment in full of the indebtedness of Dunsmuir and Modern Aluminum and on April 27 demanded payment thereof from the appellant under the guarantees.\nOn the following day, April 28, there was a stormy interview between the appellant and Summers. The bank demanded further securities for the indebtedness of Dunsmuir, Modern Aluminum and Haro as the price of postponement of immediate payment. After some days of discussion an arrangement was completed by May 12, 1959; Haro gave further security for its own indebtedness and gave guarantees, secured by mortgages on the equity of redemption in the apartment building, of the indebtedness of Dunsmuir and Modern Aluminum; in return the bank agreed to a postponement of payment until April 29, 1960.\nOn either May 11 or May 12 (Mr. Summers was not sure on which of these days) the appellant signed a letter dated May 8, 1959, which is ex. 5. Mr. Summers said that it was one of a number of documents prepared by the bank's solicitor and presented to the appellant for signature. It is dated at Vancouver, B.C. and reads as follows:\nThe Manager,\nThe Bank of Nova Scotia,\nHastings & Columbia Branch,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\nRe:\nHaro Holdings Ltd.,\nDunsmuir Construction Ltd.,\nModern Aluminum Ltd.\nIn confirmation of discussions between myself and the Bank of Nova Scotia with regard to loans made by the Bank to the three companies named above, I agree that any or all of the following measures be carried out in order to improve the Bank's security position and I will cause the companies concerned to execute and deliver to the Bank all necessary documents to implement the following steps:\u2014\n(1) That Haro Holdings Ltd. guarantee to the Bank the indebtedness of Dunsmuir Construction Ltd. and Modern Aluminum Ltd.\n(2) That Haro Holdings Ltd. furnish to the Bank by way of additional security for loans to Haro Holdings Ltd., a mortgage payable on demand with interest at 6% per annum over Lot 20, Block 32, District Lot 185, Group 1, New Westminster District, Plan 92.\n(3) That Haro Holdings Ltd., in support of its guarantee for the indebtedness of Dunsmuir Construction Ltd. and Modern Aluminum Ltd. furnish the Bank by way of additional security with a further mortgage over the aforesaid property, such mortgage to be payable on 29th April, 1960 with interest at 6% per annum.\n(4) That Haro Holdings Ltd. deliver to the Bank and to Great-West Life Assurance Company a letter under seal in accordance with the copy attached hereto and initialled by me.\n(5) That Haro Holdings Ltd. will furnish the Bank with a letter of undertaking to execute and deliver the mortgages referred to in paragraphs (2) and (3).\nI acknowledge that the acquisition by the Bank of the foregoing securities or any of them shall in no way affect my liability as guarantor of the indebtedness to the Bank of Dunsmuir Construction Ltd. and Modern Aluminum Ltd.\nYours truly,\n'N. S. Hoon' The defence of the appellant is that it was a condition precedent to his liability on the guarantees that the respondent should carry out its agreements to deal with Dunsmuir and with Modern Aluminum as its customers in the way of its business as a bank, that the respondent did not carry out those agreements, and indeed never intended to do so, and that consequently the appellant who received no part of the consideration for his promises is under no liability.\nAs to the defence the learned trial judge said in part:\nThe defendant's position is that the plaintiff did not carry out its part of the bargain because it did not deal with Dunsmuir or Modern Aluminum in the way of its business as a bank after it got the defendant's personal guarantees, and that there was therefore a total failure of the consideration for which the personal guarantees were given. The question therefore is whether or not the bank did deal with Dunsmuir and Modern Aluminum in the way of its business as a bank after the plaintiff had received the defendant's personal guarantees of the liabilities of these two companies.\nThe case made by the defendant for failure of consideration rests largely on the assertion that the plaintiff bank, immediately after it got the defendant's personal guarantees, required Dunsmuir's outstanding cheques to be covered by cash, withdrew funds to the credit of Modern Aluminum and applied those funds in partial satisfaction of the monies owing by Modern Aluminum, and on what Mr. Summers said he intended to do at the time that he obtained the guarantees. I think it established that Mr. Summer's intent at the time that he got the guarantees, was to demand payment immediately from the principal debtors and from the defendant as guarantor if payment was not forthcoming from the principal debtors, that is, Dunsmuir and Modern Aluminum, or if what the bank considered to be proper security was not provided. Put briefly, the defendant's case is that obtaining the personal guarantees of the defendant, then refusing to honour Dunsmuir's cheques without cash cover, arbitrarily applying Modern Aluminum's current account credit balance to reduce that company's liability, demanding immediate payment from Dunsmuir and Modern Aluminum and then demanding payment from the guarantors, including the defendant, cannot be considered as dealing with either Dunsmuir or Modern Aluminum in the way of the plaintiff's business as a bank, because all this amounted to was nothing more than an attempt to collect the money owing. There might well be considerable virtue in this submission if this action had been brought following demand for payment on the defendant without there having been, as there in fact was in this case, a general settlement of the differences between the plaintiff, Haro, Dunsmuir, Modern Aluminum and the defendant, with the defendant participating in such general settlement, not only personally, but also as an officer of each of the three companies which I have mentioned.\nThe issue which I would have to decide would be very different if after demand for payment was made on the defendant, there had been no settlement of the plaintiff's demand for immediate payment, and the plaintiff had immediately sued upon the defendant's guarantees. In fact the bank did not insist on immediate payment without offering an alternative to the companies concerned, and to the defendant as guarantor of the liabilities of Dunsmuir and Modern Aluminum. The bank's demand for payment brought matters to a head. It is patent that the bank offered to extend the time for payment if the additional securities and guarantees, which I have already listed, were given and it is patent that these securities and guarantees were in fact given and that the defendant agreed that the taking of security by the bank would not affect his personal guarantees.\nPut simply, what took place in my opinion was this: The Bank demanded payment of Dunsmuir and Modern Aluminum of the monies owing by these two companies; the bank, when payment was not forthcoming, then demanded payment from the defendant as guarantor. After payment was demanded a settlement was reached whereby the bank agreed to postpone its demands for payment for a year, further security and guarantees were given to the bank, all of which I have enumerated, and the defendant agreed that the bank acquiring these securities, or any of them, would in no way affect his liability to the bank as guarantor of the indebtedness of Dunsmuir and Modern Aluminum. I particularly note that the bank agreed to postpone its demands for payment for a year and that the defendant and the companies concerned have had the benefit of that agreement to postpone.\nIt appears to me to be implicit in the reasons of the learned trial judge that he would have dismissed the action if it were not for the effect which he ascribed to the arrangements completed on May 12, 1959, in connection with which the letter ex. 5, quoted above, was signed by the appellant. In this I think he would have been right. The finding of fact, fully supported by Summers' own evidence, that the respondent (which acted throughout its dealings with the appellant through its manager Summers) had no intention of dealing with Dunsmuir or Modern Aluminum in the way of its business as a bank would have been fatal to the respondent's claim. The case would have been indistinguishable from the decision of the Judicial Committee in Royal Bank of Canada v. Salvatori.[3]\nThe language of the guarantee under consideration in that case did not differ in any material particular from that in the case at bar. The facts were very similar. In the Salvatori case following the execution of the guarantee by the defendant the bank left the account of the debtor firm open but refused to extend further credit to it. Lord Atkinson who delivered the judgment of the Board said at pp. 508 and 509:\nTheir Lordships do not think that the language of this deed is so ambiguous as the appellants contend that it is, but if it be so, then they think that the key to its construction is that laid down by Lord Blackburn. Weir River Commrs. v. Adamson (1878) 2 App. Cas. 734, at 763, 47 L.J.Q.B. 193. In the report he expressed himself thus: Though no doubt the principles of construction of statutes laid down by this House in the present case must have an important effect on those who have to construe that or any other enactment. My Lords, it is of great importance that those principles should be ascertained; and I shall therefore state, as precisely as I can, what I understand from the decided cases to be the principles on which the Courts of law act in construing instruments in writing; and a statute is an instrument in writing.\nIn all cases the object is to see what is the intention expressed by the words used. But from the imperfection of language, it is impossible to know what that intention is without inquiring farther, and seeing what the circumstances were with reference to which the words were used \u2026\nAdopting that rule of construction, it is impossible in their Lordships' view, having regard to the circumstances out of which the deed of guarantee arose and in reference to which its language was used, to suppose that what was intended was that these broken and insolvent traders, the firm, should get no help from the bank beyond leaving their account open, merely continuing to carry the liability, as Connell phrases it. The learned Judge, Mr. Justice Adrian Clark, said that the words 'continuing to deal with Antoni Brothers in the way of its business as a bank must involve some bona-fide fresh transaction between the parties.' Their Lordships concur with him in this view. They think it is impossible to confine these words to merely keeping the account of this firm open, that is, merely receiving payment from anyone who chooses to pay in money to the bank to the firm's credit. The deed really contains two covenants or contracts, one being the consideration for the other, the first covenant being that if the bank continue to deal with the firm as their customer in the way of its business as a bank, the guarantor will pay to the bank the $40,000 at the times and in the manner specified and do the other things he has undertaken to do. The bank have failed to perform this covenant, they have not continued to deal with the firm as their customer in the way of their business as a bank. The guarantor has not received the consideration, i.e., the whole of the consideration upon which his covenant was based. He is therefore not bound to perform that covenant by reason of this failure.\nIn the case at bar the intention of the respondent, far from being to deal with Dunsmuir and Modern Aluminum as customers, was to terminate that relationship immediately upon receiving the guarantees from the appellant and by April 24, 1959, it had done so.\nThe real question on which there has been a difference of opinion in the Court of Appeal is as to whether the arrangement completed on May 12, 1959, altered this position in favour of the respondent. In my opinion it did not. The transaction then carried out, while it involved a number of documents, was a simple one. It was the case of a creditor pressing its debtors for payment of the balances due at the time when it had, for all practical purposes, put an end to its relationship of banker and customer with them and agreeing to give an extension of time for payment on the furnishing of additional securities. It did not, in my opinion, constitute a bona fide fresh transaction between the parties as banker and customer. The essential point is that the respondent did not grant an extension of time for payment by the two debtor companies as consideration for the obtaining of the guarantees from the appellant. What it did do was to demand and obtain additional security as the price for postponement of the enforcement of its claim for payment.\nIt remains to consider whether the situation is affected by the concluding paragraph of the letter, ex. 5, signed by the appellant. The letter has been quoted in full above and as a matter of convenience I repeat the final paragraph:\nI acknowledge that the acquisition by the Bank of the foregoing securities or any of them shall in no way affect my liability as guarantor of the indebtedness to the Bank of Dunsmuir Construction Ltd. and Modern Aluminum Ltd.\nWithout having recourse to the maxim, Verba chartarum fortius accipiuntur contra proferentem, I am of opinion that this letter does not assist the respondent. Its purpose is to retain matters in statu quo. It neither increases nor diminishes the liability of the appellant. That liability, whatever it may be, is \"in no way\" affected. I have already expressed my view that the liability did not exist.\nThe respondent did not plead any cause of action based on the terms of the letter ex. 5, nor did it plead either estoppel or waiver, but I do not found my judgment on the form of the pleadings. In my opinion on the facts found by the learned trial judge the action cannot succeed.\nCounsel for the respondent relied on the decisions in Royal Bank of Canada v. Mills[4] and Royal Bank of Canada v. Fleming et al.[5] For the reasons given by Bull J.A. I agree with his conclusion that these cases are distinguishable and that the case at bar falls within the principle of the Salvatori case.\nI wish to found my judgment not only on the reasons set out above but also on those given by Bull J.A. with which I am in full agreement. I would allow the appeal with costs throughout and direct that judgment be entered dismissing the action with costs. JUDSON J. (dissenting):\u2014The Bank of Nova Scotia sued the defendant, Nirmal Jit Singh Hoon, on two guarantees which he signed for the indebtedness of Dunsmuir Construction Ltd. and Modern Aluminum Ltd., companies in which he was interested as a majority shareholder. The trial judge gave judgment for the bank. This judgment was affirmed on appeal[6] with Bull J.A., dissenting. I agree with the judgment at trial.\nHoon first met the bank manager on April 9, 1959. He had then signed an agreement to acquire one-half of the issued shares in Dunsmuir and Modern Aluminum. He was also to become the controlling shareholder in Haro Holdings Limited. Haro Holdings Limited had an unfinished building on which no work had been done for some time. The general contractor for this building was Dunsmuir. Modern Aluminum was a supplier of materials for the building. All three companies were indebted to the bank and it is quite apparent that on April 9, when Hoon first called, the bank had real doubts of its ability to collect the outstanding indebtedness from Dunsmuir and Modern Aluminum.\nThe manager says that on April 9, on the first call, he asked Hoon to guarantee the accounts of the two companies. He did this because Hoon represented that he was or was about to become the controlling shareholder. Hoon said that he would think about the matter. He came back the following day and did sign the two guarantees upon which this action is brought.\nAt the trial, Hoon first said that it was never intended that these documents should be his personal guarantee, that the guarantor was to be Haro Holdings Limited, and that he was merely signing as president of Haro Holdings Limited with the intention that the documents were to be completed later under that company's seal. This defence is an accusation of fraud against the bank manager in using documents as personal guarantees. The trial judge found clearly and decisively against this defence and with good reason.\nHoon also said that the guarantees were signed on the understanding that the bank would make further loans totalling $75,000 to the two companies. There is an equally decisive finding by the trial judge against this defence.\nHe also said that when he signed the documents, they were not under seal and that the seals were affixed later. The trial judge found that the seals were affixed at the time of the signature. Nothing turns on the rejection of this defence. The real question is whether there was failure of consideration.\nThe findings of fact of the learned trial judge which depend upon all the probabilities of the situation and his impression of the credibility of Hoon were not disturbed on appeal. In the Court of Appeal the argument was confined to the question of failure of consideration and this does require further examination. It was the only point argued in this Court and it was the basis for the dissenting judgment of Bull J.A.\nIt is unnecessary to set out the terms of the guarantee at length. The opening paragraph reads:\nIn consideration of the bank's agreeing to deal with Dunsmuir Construction Ltd. (hereinafter called \"the customer\") in the way of its business as a bank, the undersigned hereby guarantees payment to the bank of the liabilities whether direct, contingent or otherwise which the customer has incurred or is under or may hereafter incur or be under to the bank, whether arising from dealings between the bank and the customer, or from other dealings or proceedings by which the bank may become in any manner whatever a creditor of the customer.\nAt the time when the guarantees were signed, April 10, 1959, Dunsmuir owed the bank $20,000 on a demand note and approximately $25,000 on an overdraft. Modern Aluminum owed the bank $20,000 on a demand note but had a credit balance of something over $4,000 in its current account. This sum was the residue of the moneys from its loan of $20,000 represented by the demand note. On April 14, 1959, the bank applied a sum of $5,000 on the Modern Aluminum note and, as a result, created an overdraft in the current account of close to $900. There was nothing to prevent the bank from doing this at any time. As far as Dunsmuir is concerned, the bank insisted that before any cheques would be honoured, they would have to be covered by special deposits, the company being already overdrawn by more than $20,000. In summary, after the guarantees were signed, the bank made no further advances to these two companies. Some time between April 10 and April 23, 1959, the manager received information that the two companies were operating accounts with another bank.\nThe next meeting between the manager and Hoon was on April 23. On this date the manager told Hoon that the bank would not lend money to Dunsmuir and Modern Aluminum on the basis of the defendant's pledging the shares of Haro Holdings Limited as collateral. Hoon at this time did not seem to be unduly disturbed. He said that he could make other arrangements for the completion of the building.\nOn April 24, the bank sent to Dunsmuir and Modern Aluminum demands for payment of their total indebtedness, and on April 27, demand was made on Hoon as guarantor.\nThe next interview between the bank and Hoon was on April 28 and, according to the trial judge, this was a stormy interview. Without going into details, the manager was demanding further security for the accounts of these companies and Hoon was saying that he was the victim of fraud.\nThe learned trial judge's summary of the position at this time is contained in the following paragraph:\nThe position on April 28th and immediately thereafter can best be summarized I think in this way: The plaintiff had demanded payment of the loans of Dunsmuir and Modern Aluminum and had demanded payment of these loans from the guarantors, including the defendant, under the guarantees executed by him on the 10th of April. The bank was prepared to forego its demand for immediate payment of these liabilities and defer payment for a year provided that certain additional security and undertakings were given to the bank and provided that the bank's position vis-\u00e0-vis the defendant under his personal guarantee of the liabilities of Modern Aluminum and Dunsmuir was fully preserved.\nWe are not concerned in this appeal with what would have happened if the bank had sued the guarantor at this stage. The learned trial judge found that the differences between the bank, Dunsmuir, Modern Aluminum, Haro Holdings Limited and the defendant were all settled by an exchange of letters early in May 1959. On May 8, 1959, Hoon wrote to the bank the following letter: Dear Sir:\nRe:\nHaro Holdings Ltd.,\nDunsmuir Construction Ltd.,\nModern Aluminum Ltd.\nIn confirmation of discussions between myself and the Bank of Nova Scotia with regard to loans made by the Bank to the three companies named above, I agree that any or all of the following measures be carried out in order to improve the Bank's security position and I will cause the companies concerned to execute and deliver to the Bank all necessary documents to implement the following steps:\u2014\n(1) That Haro Holdings Ltd. guarantee to the Bank the indebtedness of Dunsmuir Construction Ltd. and Modern Aluminum Ltd.\n(2) That Haro Holdings Ltd. furnish to the Bank by way of additional security for loans to Haro Holdings Ltd., a mortgage payable on demand with interest at 6% per annum over Lot 20, Block 32, District Lot 185, Group 1, New Westminster District, Plan 92.\n(3) That Haro Holdings Ltd. in support of its guarantee for the indebtedness of Dunsmuir Construction Ltd. and Modern Aluminum Ltd. furnish the Bank by way of additional security with a further mortgage over the aforesaid property, such mortgage to be payable on 29th April, 1960 with interest at 6% per annum.\n(4) That Haro Holdings Ltd. deliver to the Bank and to Great West life Assurance Company a letter under seal in accordance with the copy attached hereto and initialled by me.\n(5) That Haro Holdings Ltd. will furnish the Bank with a letter of undertaking to execute and deliver the mortgages referred to in paragraphs (2) and (3).\nI acknowledge that the acquisition by the Bank of the foregoing securities or any of them shall in no way affect my liability as guarantor of the indebtedness to the Bank of Dunsmuir Construction Ltd. and Modern Aluminum Ltd.\nOn May 12 the bank wrote the following letter to Hoon confirming the settlement:\nDear Sir:\nRe:\nHaro Holdings Ltd.,\nDunsmuir Construction Ltd.,\nModern Aluminum Ltd.\nWe refer to our recent discussions concerning the indebtedness of the above companies and wish to confirm with you as follows:\n(1) We are agreeable to deferring the repayment of our loans to Dunsmuir Construction Ltd., and Modern Aluminum Ltd., until April 29th, 1960, save that in the event of a sale being made prior to that date of the apartment building and property owned by Haro Holdings Ltd., situate on Lot 20, Block 32, District Lot 185, Group 1, N.W.D. Plan 92, we shall have the right to call for the repayment of such loans forthwith.\n(2) With regard to your guarantees to us of the indebtedness of Dunsmuir Construction Ltd., and Modern Aluminum Ltd., which are dated the 10th April, 1959, we will not call upon you for payment thereunder prior to the 29th April, 1960, unless the Haro Holdings property above referred to is sold prior thereto and we fail to receive the payment of our loans from the proceeds of sale.\n(3) With regard to our loans to Haro Holdings Ltd., and the mortgage over the above referred to property given to us as additional security, we will release the said mortgage upon the receipt from the Great-West Life Assurance Company of the sum of $136,750.00 together with a further payment from Haro Holdings Ltd., of an amount equal to the interest accrued on our loans to that Company.\nThe further security promised was duly executed and delivered to the bank.\nBefore this agreement was made the bank had an immediate right of action against the two companies. It did not enforce that right. It did not agree to lend more money. With one of the companies, it applied a credit balance against a demand note. With the other, it insisted on deposits to cover cheques as they were presented. On the facts of this case it cannot be said even at this stage that the bank did not deal with the customer \"in the way of its business as a bank.\" Masten J.A. in Royal Bank of Canada v. Fleming et al.[7] considered these very words in a bank guarantee and I am content to adopt his statement of what they demand of the bank:\nThere is nothing in these words to deprive the Bank of its discretion in granting or refusing further advances which might be sought by the debtor company. All the words call for is that it shall carry on as a Banker for the company in the usual and ordinary manner, that is to say, retaining entire freedom to exercise its own banking judgment on each individual transaction as it arose and retaining entire freedom to act as circumstances might require in respect to the large over-draft then owing.\nHowever, this is not the issue here. This guarantee by its express terms is a continuing guarantee and it was in existence at the time of the settlement. The settlement provided that the taking of the additional security was not to affect Hoon's liability as guarantor of the two companies. A binding extension of time given to the two companies was within the consideration recited in the guarantee and the defence of failure of consideration, in my opinion, fails. The case is not within the decision in Royal Bank of Canada v. Salvatori[8]. In that case it was held that the words \"continuing to deal with the customer in the way of its business as a bank\" must involve some bona fide fresh transaction between the bank and the customer, and that if the bank did no more than keep the account open by merely receiving payment from time to time, the consideration was not satisfied. It is no authority for any principle that a binding agreement to extend time for payment is not within the consideration.\nThe above grounds are those on which the learned trial judge founded his judgment. I am in full agreement with them and I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs, JUDSON J. dissenting.\nSolicitor for the defendant, appellant: I.

(Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1965: December 7, 8; 1966: March 7.\nPresent: Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Hall and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nPatents\u2014Validity\u2014Action for impeachment\u2014Declaration of invalidity\u2014Claim by plaintiff for damages based upon threats of legal proceedings \u2014Malice\u2014Patent Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 203, ss. 28(1)(b), 46\u2014Trade Marks Act, 1952-53 (Can.), c. 49, ss. 7(a), (e), 52.\nThe plaintiff, a manufacturer of wire, sued for a declaration that a patent of which the defendant was the assignee was invalid. The patent related to the construction of frames of flat wire to be used in the manufacture of brassi\u00e8res. The trial judge declared the patent invalid.\nIn his action for impeachment, the plaintiff had also claimed damages on the ground that certain steps taken by the defendant had caused him to suffer serious losses in his trade and commercial goodwill. These steps included the institution in Ontario of an infringement action against a large department store; the settlement of that action by an agreement to which a manufacturer of brassi\u00e8res using wire supplied by the present plaintiff was made a party, with provision that both those companies were debarred from contesting the patent or assisting anyone else to do so; the publication in a trade paper of a warning notice based upon the above-mentioned infringement action; and a warning letter to another manufacturer of brassi\u00e8res. The trial judge awarded to the plaintiff damages in an amount to be determined by the registrar of that Court.\nThe defendant company appealed to this Court. At the conclusion of the argument on behalf of the appellant, the appeal in so far as it declared the patent invalid was dismissed, and, after hearing counsel on the question as to whether the plaintiff had established a claim for an award of damages, judgment on that question was reserved.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Fauteux, Abbott, Martland and Hall JJ.: The plaintiff's claim for damages can properly be founded upon s. 7(a) of the Trade Marks Act, 1952-53 (Can.), c. 49. The combined effect of that section and of s. 52 of that Act is to create a statutory cause of action for which damages may be awarded if a person is damaged by false or misleading statements by a competitor tending to discredit the claimant's business, wares or service. There is no express requirement that the false or misleading statements be made with knowledge of their falsity or that they be made maliciously. The natural meaning of s. 7(a) is to give a cause of action in respect of statements which are, in fact, false, and the presence or absence of malice would only have relevance in relation to the assessment of damages. The circumstances of this case bring the plaintiff within the provisions of s. 7(a).\nPer Spence J.: In an action based on s. 7 of the Trade Marks Act, the plaintiff needs only prove the action of which he complains and the damages which he incurred as a result thereof, and need not prove malice or lack of reasonable cause on the part of the defendant. However, in the present case, it was not necessary to rely upon the principle that the plaintiff is not required to prove the defendant's malice. A consideration of the circumstances in this case demonstrates that there was evidence to show that what the defendant stated was so stated without reasonable and probable cause. There was, therefore, evidence of malice upon which the trial judge could have found for the plaintiff even if such were a necessary element of the proof. His judgment should not be interfered with.\nBrevets\u2014Validit\u00e9\u2014Action pour invalidation\u2014D\u00e9claration d'invalidit\u00e9\u2014R\u00e9clamations par le demandeur pour dommages bas\u00e9s sur des menaces de poursuites judiciaires\u2014Malice\u2014Loi sur les Brevets, S.R.C. 1952, c. 203, arts. 28(1)(b), 46\u2014Loi sur les Marques de commerce, 1952-53 (Can.), c. 49, arts. 7(a), (e), 52,\nLe demandeur, un fabricant de fils m\u00e9talliques, institua une action pour obtenir une d\u00e9claration \u00e0 l'effet qu'un brevet dont la compagnie d\u00e9fenderesse \u00e9tait la cessionnaire, \u00e9tait invalide. Le brevet se rapportait \u00e0 la construction de montures en fil m\u00e9tallique plat devant \u00eatre employ\u00e9es dans la fabrication de soutiens-gorge. Le juge au proc\u00e8s a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 le brevet invalide. Dans son action pour invalidation, le demandeur a aussi r\u00e9clam\u00e9 des dommages pour le motif que certaines mesures prises par la d\u00e9fenderesse lui avaient caus\u00e9 de s\u00e9rieuses pertes dans son achalandage commercial. Ces mesures comprenaient l'institution en Ontario d'une action pour contrefa\u00e7on contre un grand magasin \u00e0 rayons; le r\u00e8glement hors de cour de cette action par une entente \u00e0 laquelle un fabricant de soutiens-gorge se servant de fils m\u00e9talliques fournis par le pr\u00e9sent demandeur est devenu partie, avec la condition qu'il \u00e9tait interdit \u00e0 ces deux compagnies de contester le brevet ou d'aider qui que ce soit \u00e0 le faire; la publication dans un journal commercial d'une mise en garde bas\u00e9e sur cette action pour contrefa\u00e7on; et une lettre de mise en garde adress\u00e9e \u00e0 un autre manufacturier de soutiens-gorge.

Advenant la fin de la pr\u00e9sentation de l'expos\u00e9 en faveur de l'appelante, l'appel a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9 quant \u00e0 l'invalidit\u00e9 du brevet, et, apr\u00e8s avoir entendu les procureurs sur la question de savoir si le demandeur avait \u00e9tabli une r\u00e9clamation pour dommages, le jugement sur cette question fut pris en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9.\nArr\u00eat: L'appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9.\nLes Juges Fauteux, Abbott, Martland et Hall: La r\u00e9clamation du demandeur pour dommages peut proprement \u00eatre bas\u00e9e sur l'art. 7(a) de la Loi sur les Marques de commerce, 1952-53 (Can.), c. 49. L'effet combin\u00e9 de cet article et de l'art. 52 de cette Loi est de cr\u00e9er une cause d'action statutaire en vertu de laquelle des dommages peuvent \u00eatre accord\u00e9s si une personne a subi des dommages par suite de d\u00e9clarations fausses ou trompeuses de la part d'un concurrent tendant \u00e0 discr\u00e9diter l'entreprise, les marchandises ou les services du r\u00e9clamant. Il n'est pas requis express\u00e9ment que les d\u00e9clarations fausses ou trompeuses soient faites avec connaissance de leur fausset\u00e9 ou qu'elles soient faites malicieusement. L'article 7(a), dans son sens naturel, donne une cause d'action relativement \u00e0 des d\u00e9clarations qui sont, en fait, fausses, et la pr\u00e9sence ou l'absence de malice n'aurait de pertinence que relativement \u00e0 l'\u00e9valuation des dommages. Les circonstances, en l'esp\u00e8ce, font tomber le demandeur sous les dispositions de l'art. 7(a).\nLe Juge Spence: Dans une action bas\u00e9e sur l'art. 7 de la Loi sur les Marques de commerce, le demandeur n'a besoin que de prouver l'acte dont il se plaint et les dommages qu'il a encourus comme r\u00e9sultat, il n'a pas besoin de prouver la malice ou le manque de cause raisonnable de la part du d\u00e9fendeur. Cependant, dans la cause pr\u00e9sente, il n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire de s'appuyer sur le principe que le demandeur n'est pas requis de prouver la malice du d\u00e9fendeur. Une consid\u00e9ration des circonstances, en l'esp\u00e8ce, d\u00e9montre qu'il y avait une preuve \u00e0 l'effet que ce que la d\u00e9fenderesse avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 sans cause raisonnable et probable. Il y avait, en cons\u00e9quence, une preuve de malice sur laquelle le juge au proc\u00e8s pouvait se prononcer en faveur du demandeur m\u00eame si la malice \u00e9tait un \u00e9l\u00e9ment n\u00e9cessaire de la preuve. Il n'y avait pas lieu d'intervenir.\nAPPEL d'un jugement du Juge Dumoulin de la Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier du Canada,[1] d\u00e9clarant un brevet invalide et accordant des dommages dans une action d'invalidation. Appel rejet\u00e9. APPEAL from a judgment of Dumoulin J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada, [2] declaring a patent invalid and awarding damages in action for impeachment. Appeal dismissed.\nChristopher Robinson, Q.C., and Russell S. Smart, for the defendant, appellant.\nDavid Watson and Jean D. Richard, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of Fauteux, Abbott, Martland and Hall JJ. was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014At the conclusion of the argument in this appeal, only one issue remained to be determined. That was as to whether, even though the appellant's patent was invalid, the respondent had succeeded in establishing a claim for an award of damages. The position taken by the appellant was that a patent had, in fact, been granted to it; that by virtue of s. 46 of the Patent Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 203, such patent was, at all times material to the respondent's claim for damages, prima facie valid; and that the steps taken by the appellant to protect its position were taken with a view to protecting what the appellant conceived to be its own property rights.\nThe steps which were taken by the appellant are described in the judgment of my brother Spence. In summary, they included the institution in the Province of Ontario of an infringement action against Robert Simpson Company Limited; the settlement of that action by an agreement to which Peter Pan Foundations Inc. was made a party, with provision that both those companies were debarred from contesting the patent or assisting anyone else to do so; the publication, in \"Women's Wear Daily\", published in New York and circulated in Canada, of a warning notice based upon the abovementioned infringement action; and a warning letter to Exquisite Form Brassiere Canada Ltd. of Toronto.\nThe appellant's submission was that the respondent, in order to recover damages, must bring his claim within the requirements of the common law action, which has been described as \"injurious falsehood\", \"slander of goods\", and \"trade libel\". This assumes, probably correctly, that the respondent's cause of action, if one existed, arose in the Province of Ontario and would be governed by the laws of that Province. I will deal with the appellant's argument upon that basis, although, as will appear later, my opinion is that the respondent's claim for damages in this case can properly be founded upon a federal statute, and, accordingly, it is not necessary to decide that point in this case.\nThat a claim could be made at common law, provided the necessary conditions of liability were established, for damages resulting from the threat of legal proceedings in respect of alleged infringement of an invalid patent or trade mark has been established by English authorities. The first, in respect of a patent, was Wren v. Weild[3]. This was followed by Halsey v. Brotherhood[4]. The necessary requirements for the success of an action of this kind were summarized by Lord Davey in a case dealing with a trade mark, The Royal Baking Powder Company v. Wright, Crossley & Co.[5], as follows:\nTo support such an action it is necessary for the Plaintiffs to prove\n(1) that the statements complained of were untrue;\n(2) that they were made maliciously\u2014i.e., without just cause or excuse;\n(3) that the Plaintiffs have suffered special damage thereby.\nIt was the submission of the appellant that the second element abovementioned did not exist in the present case, and he relied upon the statement of Blackburn J. in Wren v. Weild, supra, at p. 737:\nThe advisers of the plaintiffs seem to have thought it was enough to maintain this action to show that the defendant could not really have maintained any action, and that if well advised he would have been told so, so as in this action indirectly to try the question whether an action for the infringement of the patent could have been maintained; whereas, as we think, the action could not lie, unless the plaintiffs affirmatively proved that the defendant's claim was not a bona fide claim in support of a right which, with or without cause, he fancied he had; but a mala fide and malicious attempt to injure the plaintiffs by asserting a claim of right against his own knowledge that it was without any foundation.\nTo the same effect is the statement of Jessel M.R. in Halsey v. Brotherhood, supra, at p. 517:\nIt is said that he (the defendant) is not entitled to tell persons buying the plaintiff's engines that they are infringements and that those persons are liable to an action; and that he is not entitled even to give a notice that these engines are infringements of his patent rights unless he follows up that notice by some legal proceeding. I must entirely dissent from that proposition. There is, as far as I am aware, no law in this country compelling a man to assert his legal right by action. He may, if he thinks fit, give notice to persons, the notices being given bona fide, that they are infringing his legal rights.\nIn England the matter of threats of proceedings for alleged patent infringement was dealt with by statute, in s. 32 of the Patents Act of 1883, but no similar provision is included in the Canadian Act. The respondent, however, relies upon the provisions of s. 7(a) of the Trade Marks Act, c. 49, Statutes of Canada 1952-53, as creating a statutory cause of action, similar in nature to the action for injurious falsehood, limited to claims in respect of statements made by a competitor, but in which malice is no longer an ingredient. That section provides as follows:\n7. No person shall\n(a) make a false or misleading statement tending to discredit the business, wares or services of a competitor;\nThe Act imposes no penalty by way of fine or imprisonment for a breach of this provision, but s. 52 provides as follows:\n52. Where it is made to appear to a court of competent jurisdiction that any act has been done contrary to the provisions of this Act, the court may make any such order as the circumstances require including provision for relief by way of injunction and the recovery of damages or profits, and may give directions with respect to the disposition of any offending wares, packages, labels and advertising material and of any dies used in connection therewith.\nSection 7 of the Trade Marks Act replaced s. 11 of The Unfair Competition Act, c. 38, Statutes of Canada 1932. So far as s. 7(a) is concerned, the scope of the subsection was extended beyond s. 11(a) by making it applicable to a \"misleading statement\" as well as to a false statement.\nThe combined effect of ss. 7(a) and 52 of the Trade Marks Act is to create a statutory cause of action for which damages may be awarded if a person is damaged by false or misleading statements by a competitor tending to discredit the claimant's business, wares or services. The essential elements of such an action are:\n1. A false or misleading statement;\n2. Tending to discredit the business, wares or services of a competitor; and\n3. Resulting damage. There is no express requirement that the false or misleading statements be made with knowledge of their falsity, or that they be made maliciously. To interpret these provisions as though such elements were implied would be to construe them as merely restating rules of law which already existed. I do not think this approach is a proper one. The Unfair Competition Act was a statutory code to provide for fair dealing in trade. Section 11 was based upon Article 10 bis of the International Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, made at the Hague, November 6, 1925, to which Canada was a party. When interpreting the provisions of a code, the correct course is that stated by Lord Herschell in Bank of England v. Vagliano Brothers[6]. He was there discussing the approach taken by the Court of Appeal in construing a provision of the Bills of Exchange Act, in relation to the state of the law before the Act was passed, and he said:\nMy Lords, with sincere respect for the learned Judges who have taken this view, I cannot bring myself to think that this is the proper way to deal with such a statute as the Bills of Exchange Act, which was intended to be a code of the law relating to negotiable instruments. I think the proper course is in the first instance to examine the language of the statute and to ask what is its natural meaning, uninfluenced by any considerations derived from the previous state of the law, and not to start with inquiring how the law previously stood, and then, assuming that it was probably intended to leave it unaltered, to see if the words of the enactment will bear an interpretation in conformity with this view.\nIn my opinion, the natural meaning of s. 7(a) is to give a cause of action, in the specified circumstances, in respect of statements which are, in fact, false, and the presence or absence of malice would only have relevance in relation to the assessment of damages.\nThe circumstances of this case bring the respondent within the provisions of s. 7(a) and accordingly, in my opinion, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nSPENCE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of Dumoulin J. in the Exchequer Court of Canada[7] pronounced on the 9th of September 1964. That judgment granted a declaration that the appellant's Canadian Letters Patent No. 525962 dated the 5th of June 1956 were invalid and awarded to the respondent damages in an amount to be determined by the Registrar of that Court. After hearing the submissions made on behalf of the appellant, this Court dismissed the appeal in so far as it declared the said Letters Patent invalid and reserved judgment upon the issue of whether the respondent was entitled to recover damages.\nThe said Canadian Patent No. 525962 was one which was concerned with the construction of arcuate frames of flat wire to be used in the manufacture of brassi\u00e8res.\nIt is the appellant's submission that even if the patent upon which it relied be found to be invalid no action lay for damages. It is the appellant's contention that by s. 46 of the Patent Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 203, the patent was prima facie valid and so long as it acted honestly to protect the patent no legal wrong was committed even if in subsequent proceedings the patent were found to be invalid.\nThe respondent bases his claim for damages on s. 7 of the Trade Marks Act, 1952-53 Statutes of Canada, c. 49, and particularly paras. (a) and (e) thereof which provide:\nNo person shall\n(a) make a false or misleading statement tending to discredit the business, wares or services of a competitor;\n***\n(e) do any other act or adopt any other business practice contrary to honest industrial or commercial usage in Canada.\nThe respondent pointing out the specific right to damages granted by s. 52 of the same statute and the jurisdiction entrusted to the Exchequer Court by s. 54 thereof, makes an alternative submission: firstly, that the respondent is entitled to recover damages under the provisions of the paragraphs of s. 7 of the Trade Marks Act which I have cited whether or not the respondent proves mala fides and, secondly, in the alternative, that even if mala fides is necessary then the circumstances in the present case have revealed such mala fides.\nA review of the English authorities cited and others convinces me that certainly under the common law action of slander of title mala fides was a necessary element. The matter was put concisely by Baggallay L.J. in Halsey v. Brotherhood[8]:\nIt appears to me that an action for slander of title will not lie unless the statements made by the defendant were not only untrue, but were made without what is ordinarily expressed as reasonable and probable cause, and this rule applies not only to actions for slander of title strictly and properly so-called with reference to real estate, but also to cases relating to personality, or personal rights or privileges.\nBaggallay L.J. continued at p. 390:\nTherefore, what we have to consider is whether there is any thing to shew that what the Defendant has stated was stated without reasonable and probable cause, even assuming it to be untrue, a question upon which at the present moment we have no means of forming an opinion.\nIt must be remembered that in Halsey v. Brotherhood the Court of Appeal was considering an appeal from the judgment of Jessel M.R., reported in (1880), 15 Ch. D. 514, by which at the commencement of the trial and before any evidence was heard the action was dismissed. The pleadings alone were considered and indeed the dismissal was without prejudice to the bringing of a fresh action.\nBowen L.J. in Skinner v. Perry[9], speaking of the common law and equity rights apart from subsequent statutory provisions, said:\nAt common law there is a cause of action whenever one person did damage to another wilfully and intentionally, and without just cause or excuse. Under that class of action came the action of slander of title, whether the subject of the slander was real or personal property. If a man falsely and maliciously\u2014because the malice would show there was no just cause\u2014made a statement about the property of another which was calculated to do, and which did do, damage to the other in the management of that property, an action would lie at Common Law, and the damages would be recoverable; and at Chancery, I suppose, that even if you could not prove actual damage had occurred, the Court might, if actual damage was likely to occur, prevent the wrongful act by injunction.\nThis view was held by the courts in England despite the recognition of the difficulty in proving malice on the part of the defendant.\nLord Coleridge L.C.J. said in Halsey v. Brotherhood, supra, at p. 389:\nI feel strongly that there is great force in what Mr. Ince has said about the difficulty in which a plaintiff may be placed by the conduct of a person in the position of the Defendant. I do not pretend to be able to answer his observations on that head, but unless there is mala fides, it is one of those instances in which the law, in the interests of society, permits an injury to be done without any remedy commensurate with it.\nSection 7 of the Trade Marks Act replaced s. 11 of the Unfair Competition Act, Statutes of Canada 1932, c. 38. There are variations in that the words \"or misleading\" now in para. (a) of s. 7 did not appear in s. 11 of the Unfair Competition Act nor did the words \"do any act or\" and \"in Canada\" now in para. (e) of s. 7 appear in para. (c) of s. 11 of the Unfair Competition Act. In my view, additional words do not assist in the determination of whether or not mala fides is a necessary element of proof.\nIt was the opinion of Dr. Harold G. Fox, Q.C., as stated in his authoritative work, Canadian Patent Law and Practice, 3rd ed., vol. II, that s. 11 of the Unfair Competition Act was statutory authority for the common law action of slander of title or trade libel and on pp. 963-4 the learned author states:\nA reading of the section will show that a cause of action is given merely when disparaging statements are made which are false. Malice need not be shown. This is a most important result for, as we have seen, the necessity of proving malice takes away much of the force and utility of a common law action.\nThis view was repeated in the same author's work, Canadian Patent Law of Trade Marks, 2nd ed., vol. II, at p. 717, where he continued:\nThe statutory provision is quite clear that the false or misleading character and the discrediting tendency of a statement are sufficient to give a right of action. Malice, bad faith or lack of reasonable cause are not mentioned and therefore do not need to be proved.\nAuthority in Canada is very sparse indeed. In Reliable Plastics Ltd. v. Louis Marx & Co. Inc.[10], the plaintiff brought an action for impeachment of the defendant's patent and also claimed damages for threats. The latter claim was based on three grounds: (1) s. 11 (a) of the Unfair Competition Act, (2) the common law action, and (3) an action under the Statute of Monopolies. Thorson P. found that the statement complained of was not false and therefore, of course, no action lay under s. 11 of the Unfair Competition Act or under common law. The issue, therefore, of whether or not malice were required did not arise. The editorial note to the case made by the same learned author, Dr. Fox, reads, in part:\nIt is regrettable that the claim for damages for threats of infringement failed for the reasons found by the learned president\u2026\nThere is much force to the argument that by the enactment of these sections, firstly, in the Unfair Competition Act and then, in the Trade Marks Act, Parliament has intended to give a right of action whether or not the plaintiff may prove mala fides. As I have said, the necessity for that proof at common law has been clearly established in decisions including those of the House of Lords. If Parliament had intended that the ingredient should be a necessary one for the statutory cause of action which it granted in the aforesaid sections, surely it would have made such a reservation in the legislation. It must be remembered that the provision is in no sense criminal law and that mala fides or malice, or lack of reasonable cause, no matter what term is used, is, therefore, not a necessary ingredient. It should also be remembered that in ordinary libel law, apart from cases of qualified privilege, malice need not be proved and there is no valid distinction between the harm wrought to a plaintiff's reputation in business and the harm wrought to the wares he sells.\nMoreover, the person seeking to defend his patent has a choice of immediately commencing an action for infringement and applying for an injunction to restrain the continuance of such prejudice to his patent rights, or of bringing action for damages against those who use, in their business, the wares manufactured by the alleged infringer. If he chooses the first alternative, he may join as parties defendants all who purchase from the alleged infringer to use in their business. The injunction having been granted only upon his undertaking to pay the damages incurred thereby should he fail, he proceeds at his own risk. There would seem to be no valid reason why rather than choosing that forthright course he should be permitted to proceed by threats against the purchasers from the alleged infringer without rendering himself liable for damages unless his mala fides could be proved.\nFor these reasons, I am of the opinion that in an action based on s. 7 of the Trade Marks Act the plaintiff need only prove the action of which he complains and the damage which he incurred as a result thereof and need not prove mala fides or lack of reasonable cause on the part of the defendant. However, in the particular case, it is not necessary to rely upon the principle that the plaintiff is not required to prove the defendant's mala fides.\nThe proof of malice need not be by admission of the defendant in the course of litigation or otherwise. In Manitoba Free Press Co. v. Nagy[11], Davies J. dealing with the necessity of proving malice in an action for slander of title, said at p. 348:\nThe defendant was bound to prove malice. But malice in this connection is a question of mala fides or bona fides. If the absence of bona fides is shewn or may fairly and reasonably be inferred from the facts proved then I take it that the ingredient of malice is sufficiently proved. It is laid down by Mr. Pollock in his work on Torts, page 301, that in actions of this kind\n\"the wrong is a malicious one in the only proper sense of the word, that is, the absence of good faith is an essential condition of liability\".\n(The italics are my own.)\nIn determining whether there was evidence of malice, the task of this Court is, as was that of the Court of Appeal in Halsey v. Brotherhood, supra, to consider \"whether there is anything to show that what the defendant has stated was stated without reasonable and probable cause\". In so doing, we have the advantage of considering the sworn evidence given at the trial on behalf of the plaintiff, here respondent. The only witnesses who gave evidence on behalf of the defendant, here appellant, were a brassi\u00e8re designer employed by it and two expert witnesses.\nThe plaintiff testified that he had known of the defendant's U.S. Patent as early as 1955 having received information as to it when dealing with an unconnected matter, but had not manufactured flat wire for use in brassi\u00e8res until 1958. In that year he did so after a customer had produced to him drawings requesting him to duplicate the product there illustrated. He testified that he does not yet know whether these drawings were in fact the defendant's as they appeared to be the customer's drawings. The plaintiff continued to manufacture flat wire for brassi\u00e8re frames supplying customers in both Canada and the U.S. On August 13, 1959, the defendant caused to be forwarded to the plaintiff a letter which read:\nAugust 13, 1959.\nHops-Koch Products,\n733 Maria Avenue,\nMONTREAL 30, Quebec.\nAttn: Mr. R. Rowell\nI represent S. & S. Industries Inc. of New York, who is the owner of Canadian Letters Patent No. 525,962 issued on June 5, 1956 for a flat wire bent in to an arcuate shape for insertion into brassieres.\nI have been credibly informed that you are making such flat wire bent in arcuate shape for use in brassieres and we have obtained samples of your product. You are hereby advised that unless you inform us within the week that you will immediately cease and desist from the manufacture, sale and use of such flat arcuate wires for use in brassieres, you will leave us with no other alternative but to forward the matter to my Canadian associates for institution of legal proceedings for infringement of the aforesaid patent.\nYour reply is awaited.\nVery Truly Yours,\n\"IRVING SEIDMAN\"\nThe defendant, however, instituted no such \"legal proceedings for infringement of the aforesaid patent\" as it had threatened. One cannot but note that such an action would have been the forthright method which the defendant might have utilized to protect its patent if it honestly believed the patent were valid, and that in such an action by virtue of s. 59 of the Patent Act, the defendant could have obtained an injunction completely protecting its alleged rights. The defendant, however, turned to other methods of \"protecting its patent\".\nOn December 7, 1959, it delivered to the Robert Simpson Co. Ltd. a statement of claim in an action in the Supreme Court of Ontario, No. 7587 for 1959. In that action, the said Robert Simpson Company had been named the sole defendant. In the statement of claim, damages were claimed for the infringement of the patent held by the defendant in this action by the sale of brassi\u00e8res manufactured by Peter Pan Foundations using wire supplied by the plaintiff in this action. On December 14, 1959, the defendant wrote to Exquisite Form Brassi\u00e8re Canada Ltd., of Toronto, a very large manufacturer. In attempting to force that manufacturer to purchase its flat wire from the defendant, it said in part:\nWe have been informed by our Attorneys that retailers who sell garments containing Flat Wire that do not emanate from us, or any of our licensees, may be subjected to suit. Our point to Mr. Reiner was that in order that we may best protect our interests, we would be forced to go to the stores and involve them in law suits. This brings with it the extreme loss of time on the part of all executives in the store who become involved in lengthy pre-trial examinations as well as expense involved. It is evident that such stores would be reluctant to handle a line which can implicate them in these circumstances.\nThree days later, on December 17, 1959, the defendant inserted an advertisement in the widely circulated trade paper known as \"Women's Wear Daily\" showing a torn clipping reporting the action against the Robert Simpson Co. Ltd. to which I have referred and with the warning \"Please protect yourself\u2014See S. & S. reprint enclosed\", inscribed thereon. The words of Bowen L.J. in Skinner v. Perry, supra, are relevant:\nNow, every person of common sense knows what is involved in patent actions, and what the expense of them is, and everybody knows that to be threatened with a patent action is about as disagreeable a thing as can happen to a man in business, and the thing most calculated to paralyse a man in his business, even if he be innocent of any infringement of patent law.\nThe plaintiff gave evidence as to the effect of these actions by the defendant:\nMR. HENDERSON : Q. Mr. Rowell, I asked you if you would identify Exhibit 11 as the page in Women's Wear that you saw. Would you tell the Court what happened after the publication of that page in Women's Wear?\nA. The same day that it was published I received phone calls from various customers of mine wanting to know what it is all about.\nQ. What was the effect in terms of your customers; the effect on your business? A. I lost the American market.\nQ. Did you lose any particular customer in Canada? A. I lost Peter Pan round wires, flat wire, sorry, and the Robert Simpson.\nHIS LORDSHIP: You say you lost the American market: did that represent an important proportion of your clients or your clientele.\nTHE WITNESS: At that time, yes, my Lord, and at the present.\nMR. HENDERSON: Q. Did you ever hear of a company called Exquisite Form? A. Yes.\nQ. What happened there. A. Well, Exquisite Form, New York City, never sent any more orders after\u2014I had just started with the Exquisite Form Inc. and I lost them as a customer in the States and in Canada.\nThese very actions by the defendant, who had however, refrained from instituting any infringement action, caused the plaintiff in turn to take the action outlined in para. 17 of the statement of claim of this action:\n17. The Plaintiff through its Patent Attorney, Mr. E. N. Fetherston-haugh, did notify the Defendant Company on January 25, 1960, that the Defendant Company had caused the Plaintiff great harm and damages and that the Plaintiff would be forced to institute legal proceedings to recover the damages so suffered.\nThe defendant neither specifically admitted nor denied receipt of that letter, nor was the letter produced. It is, of course, quite plain that the defendant, upon receipt of that letter, would have had the clearest possible notice that the plaintiff strenuously denied any infringement of a valid patent. Despite that notice, it would appear that the defendant hastened to conclude its litigation with the Robert Simpson Co. Ltd. On February 2, 1960, it executed Minutes of Settlement of the action whereby both the defendant therein, the Robert Simpson Company Ltd., and its sup- plier, Peter Pan Foundations Inc., acknowledged the validity of Canadian Patent No. 525962 and undertook not to directly or indirectly contest the validity thereof nor aid or assist others in any such proceeding in order to make, use or sell arcuate wire frames embodying the invention unless the same were manufactured by the present defendant.\nIt should be noted that neither the named defendant in that action, the Robert Simpson Company Ltd., nor its supplier, Peter Pan Foundations Inc., were required to pay any sum as damages or royalties to the defendant in this action and that both were permitted to dispose of their inventories on hand.\nIt would appear, therefore, that the defendant, after it had received express notice that the plaintiff denied he was guilty of infringement and intended to claim damages for such actions on the part of the defendant as are the subject of the claim in this action, proceeded with the most significant expedition to settle an action avoiding any test therein of the validity of its patent, and also effectively removing any contest thereof or assistance in the contest by a large manufacturer and a very large distributor. In addition, the defendant deprived the plaintiff of an opportunity to sell his wares in a very considerable market.\nTherefore, in my view, this consideration of the circumstances demonstrates that there was evidence to show that what the defendant stated was so stated without reasonable and probable cause. There was, therefore, evidence of malice upon which the learned Exchequer Court Judge could have found for the plaintiff even if such were a necessary element of the proof and his judgment should not be interfered with.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Smart & Biggar, Ottawa.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: Gowling, MacTavish, Osborne & Henderson, Ottawa.\n[1] [1965] 1 Ex.

Hotel Limited (Defendant) Respondent.\n1965: November 17, 18, 19, 22, 23; 1966: March 11.\nPresent: Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nArbitration\u2014Option to purchase certain lands\u2014One component of purchase price determined by arbitration\u2014Arbitrator\u2019s award reduced by Court of Appeal\u2014Interpretation of option\u2019s terms.\nThree parcels of land, referred to as the Walker House lot, the Petrie Garage lot and the Elgin Motors lot, were owned by the appellant City in fee simple subject to leases which it had granted of each property. Under the lease between the City and the respondent company the latter leased from the City the land and buildings composing the Walker House Hotel and as a term of the said lease was granted an option to purchase the said lands upon which the hotel stood and also the adjacent lands covered by the Petrie and Elgin leases. The hotel building on the Walker lot was dealt with specifically in the option and the price for its transfer settled. The buildings on the other two lots were owned by the respective lessees who were separate companies. The two leases gave right of renewal and certain rights of compensation for the buildings if the City refused a renewal, as it had the right to do.\nThe option was divided into two periods, firstly, that running from the date of the execution of the lease, August 1, 1956, to February 1, 1958; secondly, from February 1, 1958, to the end of the term of the lease, July 31, 1966. According to para. 2 of the option, the purchase price when the option was exercised during the currency of the lease but after February 1, 1958, the event which occurred, contained three components. The parties failed to agree on the second of these components, which was \u201csuch amount as the parties shall agree upon as the then value of the lands (excluding buildings) in Schedules \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 as the parties shall agree upon, and failing such agreement, the then value of such lands as determined by arbitration pursuant to the provisions of The Municipal Arbitrations Act, R.S.O. 1950, Chapter 244\u201d. The question was submitted to the arbitrator and he fixed the component at $780,000. The Court of Appeal reduced the arbitrator\u2019s award to $422,057.08.\nThe arbitrator, after a review of the option terms, concluded that \u201cthe amount to be determined in this arbitration is the value of the land without regard to the buildings, i.e. as if vacant\u201d. The Court of Appeal, on the other hand, held that there were substantial errors in arriving at that conclusion caused in the main by the erroneous construction placed upon the option terms by the arbitrator and held that the option was to be construed in the light of the provisions as to renewals and as to payments for buildings erected upon refusal of renewal in both the Elgin and Petrie leases. The Court of Appeal, in addition, in construing para. 2 in the option held that due weight must be given to the purchase price which would have been effective during the first eighteen months of the option term. Held (Judson J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Martland, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ.: As to the latter conclusion of the Court of Appeal, it was agreed that this transaction being an ordinary commercial transaction it was the duty of the Court in interpreting the agreement to avoid such an interpretation as would result in commercial absurdity. Reddy v. Strople (1911), 44 S.C.R. 246; Grey v. Pearson (1857), 26 L.J. Ch. 473; Diederichsen v. Farquharson Brothers (1898), 1 Q.B. 150, referred to.\nThe approach of the Court of Appeal was a correct one, and what should be calculated in order to determine \u201cas the then value of the lands (excluding buildings) in Schedules \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 is the fee simple in the Walker House lands less the agreed upon valuation of the buildings thereon plus the reversionary interest of the [lessor] in the rest of the site with all its interests, advantages and burdens\u201d. Accordingly, the appeal should be dismissed subject, however, to the right of the appellant, if it is of the opinion that part of the sum deducted in reference to a bar premises on part of the Petrie lot is for tenant\u2019s fixtures, to require the arbitrator to consider this item and to reduce it by any amount which, in the opinion of the arbitrator, did not represent value of the building upon the lands leased to Petrie.\nPer Judson J., dissenting: The arbitrator was not in error in his interpretation of the agreement. What he had to ascertain was the value of the land. With the exercise of the option in December 1962, the buildings would become the problem of the optionee company when it took an assignment of the leases on the Petrie and Elgin lots. It then became the landlord and would have to decide whether to renew the leases or pay for the buildings. There was, in fact, no problem because of the common control of the three companies and it was never expected that there would be. Further, if the option had been exercised after the expiry of the Petrie and Elgin leases, whatever sum the City had been compelled to pay by way of compensation for the buildings would have been payable by the optionee company in addition to the value of the land.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, reducing an award made by the Official Arbitrator under the provisions of The Municipal Arbitrations Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 244. Appeal dismissed, Judson J. dissenting.\nM.E. Fram and D.C. Lyons, for the appellant.\nW.L.N. Somerville, Q.C., and J.D. Holding, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Martland, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nSPENCE J.:\u2014This is an appeal by the vendor, the Corporation of the City of Toronto, from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario pronounced on November 13, 1964. By that judgment, the Court of Appeal for Ontario decreased the award of the Official Arbitrator made on August 22, 1963. That award had fixed the amount of one component of the purchase price as provided in an option to purchase contained in the lease between the parties dated August 1, 1956. The premises in question composed property in the City of Toronto on the south side of Front Street commencing at the westerly limit of York Street and running westerly 317.42 feet.\nIn the year 1955, these lands had been owned by the vendor, the Corporation of the City of Toronto, and had been subject to three leases as follows:\n(1) A lease to the Walker House Hotel Company for a period of 21 years expiring on April 30, 1955, and covering the westerly 112 feet.\n(2) A lease to Petrie\u2019s Parking Place Limited for 21 years expiring on September 30, 1965, which contained an option exercisable by the lessee for a further 21-year period. This lease covered the property from the westerly boundary of the Walker House Hotel property westerly for 165.42 feet.\n(3) A lease to Elgin Motors Limited dated May 29, 1942, and expiring on December 31, 1962, which lease also contained an option exercisable by the lessee for a further 21-year period and which covered the westerly 40 feet of the property.\nMr. J.D. Crashley owned a controlling interest in Elgin Motors Ltd. and Mr. Crashley\u2019s father, with others, owned all of the shares in Petrie\u2019s Parking Place Ltd. Mr. Crashley approached the city with proposals for the development of the whole parcel and in view of the irregular termination of the leases covering the property it was suggested to Mr. Crashley that he enter into negotiations with the Estate of the late George Wright who controlled Walker House Hotel Company.\nMr. Crashley caused to be incorporated W.H. Hotel Ltd. and that company bought out Walker House Hotel Company. This transaction entailed the purchase of the balance of the term of the lease held by Walker House Hotel Company from the City of Toronto and also the purchase from that company of the building which it had erected on the said lands, i.e., Walker House Hotel. This building, W.H. Hotel Ltd. sold to the Corporation of the City of Toronto, the owner of the fee, for $310,000. W.H. Hotel Ltd. then leased from the Corporation of the City of Toronto the land and buildings composing the Walker House Hotel and as a term of the said lease were granted an option to purchase the lands upon which the hotel stood and also the lands to the west thereof covered by the aforesaid leases to Petrie\u2019s Parking Place Ltd. and to Elgin Motors Ltd. The terms of this option were as follows:\nIn consideration of the rent hereby reserved to the Lessor, the Lessor hereby agrees to sell to the Lessee at the Lessee\u2019s option the lands more particularly described in Schedules \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d hereto annexed, subject to the terms and conditions following:\n1. If the option is exercised by the Lessee on or before the first day of February, 1958, the purchase price of the lands shall be the sum of Four Hundred and Seventeen Thousand and Eighty-one Dollars ($417,081.00) plus an amount equal to the present value of the buildings on the lands in Schedule \u201cA\u201d (as hereinafter defined);\n2. If the option is exercised by the Lessee after the first day of February, 1958, the purchase price of the lands shall be an amount equal to the present value of the buildings on the lands in Schedule \u201cA\u201d as aforesaid, plus such amount as the parties shall agree upon as the then value of the lands (excluding buildings) in Schedules \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d as the parties shall agree upon, and failing such agreement, the then value of such lands as determined by arbitration pursuant to the provisions of The Municipal Arbitrations Act, R.S.O. 1950, Chapter 244; plus the amount or amounts, if any, which the Lessor shall have paid to the Lessees of the lands in Schedule \u201cB\u201d as compensation for the buildings situate hereon, as provided in (a) a certain lease dated the 21st day of March, 1945 made between The Corporation of the City of Toronto as Lessor and Petrie\u2019s Parking Place, Limited as Lessee and (b) a certain lease dated the 28th day of May, 1942 made between The Corporation of the City of Toronto as Lessor and H.W. Petrie Co. Limited as Lessee.\nThe \u201cpresent value\u201d of the buildings on the lands in Schedule \u201cA\u201d for the purposes aforesaid shall be determined by ascertaining the value at the date of the exercise of the said option of the sum of Three Hundred and Ten Thousand Dollars ($310,000.00) amortized over a period of thirty years from the first day of August, 1956, at the rate of six per centum per annum, premising that rent paid by the Lessor to such date had been paid on account, firstly, of the accrued interest on such sum calculated monthly, and the balance to the reduction of the principal, less the amount of all insurance proceeds theretofore paid to the Lessor and not used or applied to the repair, restoration or rebuilding of the building on the demised premises pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Lease.\n3. The foregoing option shall be in force during the full term of this Lease.\n4. Notice of election to purchase under this option by the Lessee or its assigns shall be in writing and shall be delivered to the Lessor at Toronto.\n5. It is understood that the purchase price shall be paid in such manner, at such time or times and on such terms as the parties hereto might in good faith agree upon at the time of the exercise of the said option and failing such agreement shall be paid in cash or by certified cheque.\nUpon payment to the Lessor of the full amount of the purchase price the Lessee shall be entitled to a conveyance of the said lands free of encumbrances except such encumbrances as have been made or created by the Lessee.\n6. Unless otherwise agreed the contract of purchase and sale shall be completed within ninety days of the date referred to in the said notice of election as being the date of the exercise of the said option.\nIt will be noted that the option is divided into two periods, firstly, that running from the date of the execution of the lease to February 1, 1958, i.e., a period of 18 months, dealt with in para. 1; secondly, from February 1, 1958, to the end of the term of the lease, July 31, 1966. This period is dealt with in para. 2.\nThe option was exercised on December 21, 1962. As I have said, both the leases to Petrie\u2019s Parking Place Ltd. and to Elgin Motors Ltd. contained options to renew at the option of the lessees. Both the said leases also contained a provision which permitted the city to refuse to accept this renewed term upon the city paying the value of the buildings erected on the said lands by the lessees. These terms will be referred to particularly hereafter. I note now, however, that the exercise of the option to purchase by W.H. Hotel Ltd. occurred immediately before the expiry of the lease to Elgin Motors Ltd. which would have occurred on December 31, 1962, and, of course, prior to the expiry of the lease to Petrie\u2019s Parking Place Ltd. which would have occurred on September 30, 1965, and therefore before the City of Toronto had to comply with either lessee\u2019s demand for a renewal or, in refusing that demand, pay the value of the buildings erected on the said lands by the said lessees.\nThe purchase price applicable to the first 18-month period is set out accurately in para. 1 of the said option as being $417,081 plus an amount equal to the present value of the buildings on the lands in Schedule \u201cA\u201d as defined in the said lease. That present value set out in para. 2 would, during the first 18-month period, have amounted very close to the purchase price of the buildings of $310,000 so that the purchase price, had the option been exercised during that period, would have been close to $727,081.\nAccording to para. 2 of the option, the purchase price when the option was exercised during the currency of the lease but after February 1, 1958, the event which occurred, contained three components: (1) the present value of the lands in Schedule \u201cA\u201d as defined in para. 2, (2) \u201csuch amount as the parties shall agree upon as the then value of the lands (excluding buildings) in Schedules \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 as the parties shall agree upon, and failing such agreement, the then value of such lands as determined by arbitration pursuant to the provisions of The Municipal Arbitrations Act, R.S.O. 1950, Chapter 244\u201d, (3) plus the amount or amounts, if any, \u201cwhich the lessor shall have paid to the lessees in Schedules \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019\u201d, i.e., to Petrie\u2019s Parking Place Ltd. and Elgin Motors Ltd. Since no amount had been paid to either of the lessees, the third component may be omitted in calculation of the purchase price. The parties failed to agree upon the second component and therefore in accordance with the provisions of the option the question was submitted to the Official Arbitrator under the provisions of The Municipal Arbitrations Act, referred to above as R.S.O. 1950, c. 244, now R.S.O. 1960, c. 250. The Official Arbitrator, Mr. John C. Risk, Q.C., fixed the component at $780,000. The Court of Appeal for Ontario amended that award to fix the component at $422,057.08. Since in both cases the first component of the purchase price, i.e., the present value of the buildings, amounted to an agreed figure of $282,143.92, the purchase price under the option according to the award of the arbitrator would have been $1,062,143.92, while according to the judgment of the Court of Appeal it was $704,201, a difference of $357,942.92.\nThe detailed evidence as to values was given really by only two witnesses, Mr. James Innes Stewart on behalf of the purchaser, and Mr. Robert A. Davis on behalf of the vendor.\nAs pointed out by the learned arbitrator:\nMr. Davis valued the land, as if vacant and \u201cunencumbered\u201d at $989,000. Mr. Stewart valued \u201cthe whole site, fee simple, without leases or encumbrances\u201d, at $1,155,000, and he said that in transferring the prices of his comparables to the subject property he had tried to reflect the total value as though clear of all buildings and lessees\u2019 interests. The difference between these two figures, while a considerable sum of money, is not unduly great in proportion to the large amounts involved and the difficulties in appraising a property which is on the fringe of other developments but whose greatest potential may not be realized for ten years. The great disparity between the final amounts reached by these two eminent appraisers was the result of the opposing views as to the proper construction of the option.\nIt is, of course, apparent that the great disparity between the award of the Official Arbitrator and the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario is in the interpretation which it places upon the words contained in the option and particularly in para. 2 thereof. The arbitrator, after a review of the option terms, concluded that \u201cthe amount to be determined in this arbitration is the value of the land without regard to the buildings, i.e. as if vacant\u201d. The Court of Appeal for Ontario, on the other hand, held that there were substantial errors in arriving at that conclusion caused in the main by the erroneous construction placed upon the option terms by the learned arbitrator and held that the option was to be construed in the light of the provisions as to renewals and as to payments for buildings erected upon refusal of renewal in both the Elgin Motors Ltd. and Petrie\u2019s Parking Place Ltd. leases.\nThe Court of Appeal, in addition, in construing para. 2 in the option held that that due weight must be given to the purchase price which would have been effective during the first eighteen months of the option term.\nTo refer first to the latter conclusion, I agree that this transaction being an ordinary commercial transaction it is the duty of the Court in interpreting that document to avoid such an interpretation as would result in commercial absurdity. Duff J. in Reddy v. Strople[1], at p. 257, added to the canon that the primary meaning if unambiguous should be adopted, the proviso that it should be \u201csensible with reference to the extrinsic circumstances\u2026\u201d. In such a course the learned late Chief Justice of this Court adopted in terms the \u201cgolden rule of interpretation\u201d as stated by Lord Wensleydale in Grey v. Pearson[2], at p. 481. I suggest it is also put with accuracy and relevancy to the question here at issue by Rigby L.J. in Diederichsen v. Farquharson Brothers[3], at p. 159:\nIf the literal construction leads to an absurdity, repugnancy, or inconsistency which reasonable people cannot be supposed to have contemplated under the circumstances, it ought if possible to be modified so as to avoid such a result.\nAs I have pointed out, the purchase price for the eighteen-month period under para. 1 of the option would have been around $727,081, while the purchase price adding both components under the learned arbitrator\u2019s award would have been $1,062,143.92. The arbitrator\u2019s award was made as of December 21, 1962, and the witness Stewart, whom the learned arbitrator described as \u201can appraiser of the highest qualifications and great experience\u201d, testified that the values at the time of the option were, if anything, slightly lower at the date of the lease.\nMoreover, the real difference between the cost to the purchaser under the option in the first eighteen-month period and that as fixed by the arbitrator might well be even more startling. Under the arbitrator\u2019s theory, the price that he had to fix was the price as if the lands had been vacant. The purchaser then buying the lands would have been faced with the situation which was to occur at the expiry of the Petrie\u2019s Parking Place Limited lease and the Elgin Motors lease. By the terms of those leases, the lessees had the right to demand their renewal for a twenty-one-year period at a rental to be fixed by agreement of arbitration, and the lessor\u2019s right to refuse that renewal was conditional upon the lessor paying to the lessee the value of the buildings erected by the lessee.\nThe learned arbitrator said, in his reasons,\nIf the purchaser were allowed to deduct from its purchase price the value of the buildings or leasehold interest therein enjoyed by the other lessees there would be nothing to prevent them from asserting their own claims against the city in the future.\nThe Court of Appeal, in the judgment of Aylesworth J., on the other hand, noted,\nIt is, I think, conceded that the lessor\u2019s obligations as to renewal of the Elgin and Petrie leases or payment for the Elgin and Petrie buildings will pass to appellant upon conveyance from respondent and that after conveyance the Lessees must look to appellant, not to respondent for fulfilment of those obligations; at any rate we think that is the legal situation.\nIn this Court, counsel for the appellant refused to concede such a result and submitted that upon exercise of the option the appellant was still bound by the covenants in the said leases.\nWithout having to decide whether the view of the learned arbitrator or that of Aylesworth J.A., speaking for the Court of Appeal, is the correct view, it is sufficient to realize that if the view of the Court of Appeal were correct, the cost to the purchaser would be increased over the $1,062,143.92 by $492,837, the cost of paying to the lessees the value of their buildings as of December 21, 1962, making the total cost to the purchaser $1,554,980.92 for lands which, according to the highest evidence given by an appraiser before the arbitrator, had a value for their fullest and best use of $1,155,000.\nIt is difficult to understand how an experienced businessman would enter into any commercial transaction calling for him to pay so many hundreds of thousands of dollars more than a stranger going into the property would offer, and more than double what the parties had arrived at by negotiation at arm\u2019s length as the purchase price to cover the first eighteen\u2011month period.\nIn construing the terms of the option, in the light of the provisions as to rights of renewal and payments in lieu thereof contained in the Elgin and Petrie leases, we must consider what the vendor had to sell and therefore what the optionee had a right to purchase. It is, of course, true as said by counsel for the appellant that very often parties do make an agreement whereby the vendor agrees to sell what he does not then own with the intention that the vendor should acquire ownership in that which he agrees to sell in order to carry out his contract with the purchaser.\nIn the second period, however, the option is, in my view, to sell just what the city owned and what the city owned was the fee simple in the land and buildings in the Walker House Hotel property and the lessees\u2019 reversionary interest in the Petrie and Elgin Motors lands. The value of the buildings on the Walker House property was easily fixed as the city had purchased that building immediately prior to the execution of the lease containing the option, for $310,000 and the formula for fixing that value is set out in the option and applies in both periods A and B. By agreement of parties, application of that formula fixed the value of the said Walker House building at the time of the exercise of the option at $282,143.92. The value of the Walker House land and of the reversionary interest under the Petrie lease and Elgin Motors lease could not be fixed with such exactitude and called for a provision such as gave rise to this litigation.\nOn the lands to the Elgin Motors lease, there was a small brick and frame office building and since that lease expired only 10 days after the option to purchase was exercised the parties agreed that the lessee\u2019s reversionary interest was valued at only $19,600. However, on the lands under the Petrie lease there was originally an old brick and masonry building known as the Cyclorama and that building had stood substantially unaltered from about the turn of the century until 1927. Then Petrie Parking Place Ltd. had built into the building a substantial parking garage. According to the evidence of Mr. Cross, a consulting engineer, that parking garage had a bricks and mortar value at the date of the exercise of the option of $298,776, and according to Mr. Stewart\u2019s evidence arrived at by capitalization of the annual revenues its value was some $38,000 greater.\nBy the provisions of the lease from the appellant to Petrie\u2019s Parking Place Ltd., the lessee was required to maintain the present building (the old Cyclorama) or any building of equal or greater value, and the provision permitting the lessor to refuse renewal of the lease required the lessor to pay \u201csuch reasonable sum as the buildings made and erected on the said premises shall then be worth; such value to be determined by mutual agreement or by the Official Arbitrator less the sum of $5,000 being the building as wholly or substantially situated upon the land hereby demised at the time of such determination\u2026\u201d. Therefore, what the city had to sell as to the Petrie lands was the lessor\u2019s reversionary interest in a building which was the property of the lessor, it having been erected on its lands by the lessee with no reservation of title, subject to deduction therefrom of a sum representing its value less $5,000.\nThe Court of Appeal for Ontario accepted the sum of $298,776 less $5,000 as being the true value of the building upon the Petrie lands and I agree with the view expressed in the Court of Appeal that this is a proper valuation despite the fact that Mr. Cross in giving his estimate did not deal with any element of obsolescence. As noted by Aylesworth J.A., from the fact that Mr. Cross\u2019s valuation is $38,000 less than the capitalization value arrived at by Mr. Stewart and, according to Mr. Teperman the cost of demolishing the building, which was necessary for the development of the site, was $27,476, it would appear that the obsolescence must have been impliedly, although not expressly, considered in Mr. Cross\u2019s valuation.\nUpon all of these considerations, I have therefore come to the conclusion that the approach of the Court of Appeal for Ontario was, with respect, a correct one, and that what should be calculated in order to determine \u201cas the then value of the lands (excluding buildings) in Schedules \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 is the fee simple in the Walker House lands less the agreed upon valuation of the buildings thereon plus the reversionary interest of the respondent in the rest of the site with all its interests, advantages and burdens\u201d\nIn the Court of Appeal for Ontario this calculation was set out as follows:\nValue of the whole site in fee simple.............................................................................\n$ 1,155,000.00\nDeduct:\n(a) Value of Petrie lessee\u2019s interests......................\n$293,776.00\n(b) Value of Swiss Bear bar, etc..............................\n137,423.00\n(c) Value of Walker House building as agreed upon............................................................................\n282,143.92\n(d) Value of Elgin lessee\u2019s interests........................\n19,600.00\n732,942.92\nValue of \u201cthe lands (excluding buildings)\u201d to be paid by appellant\n$ 422,057.08\nI am concerned with only one element in this calculation\u2014that set out in the item marked (b)\u2014\u201cvalue of Swiss Bear bar etc. $137,423\u201d. This Swiss Bear was a bar premises erected by Petrie\u2019s Parking Place Ltd. on part of the lands leased to it by the appellant and then sublet by it to W.H. Hotel Ltd. The only evidence as to how that figure was arrived at is in the evidence of Albert C. Cartledge, a chartered accountant who gave evidence on behalf of the purchaser and who testified:\nQ. Now then, Mr. Cartledge, would you be good enough to tell us the sum of money which was expended to produce the Swiss Bear Cocktail Bar? A. There was expended on account of building improvements and equipment the total of $137,473.37.\n(The italics are my own.)\nThere was no cross-examination whatsoever upon that answer, counsel for the appellant then appearing to rely upon the position which the appellant has taken throughout that only values of vacant land had to be considered in the arbitration. The witness identified as his work two exhibits, Nos. 3 and 4, and neither of those exhibits contained any such item.\nUnder the covenant between the appellant and Petrie Parking Place Ltd., the appellant was to pay \u201csuch reasonable sum as the buildings made and erected on the said demised premises shall then be worth\u201d. Therefore, if the sum of $137,423 represented the value of the building built by the lessee upon the lands, it is a proper item of deduction as being an item which is part of the lessee\u2019s interest. If, on the other hand, part of the sum is represented by items of equipment which have not become attached to the land then the lessee upon the termination of the lease, would have had a right to remove the same and could not have claimed the value of such equipment from the appellant as part of the consideration which the appellant had to pay for its refusal to renew. There seem to be no means whereby we might determine this question upon any of the evidence now presented. I am, therefore, of the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs subject, however, to the right of the appellant, if it is of the opinion that part of the sum deducted in reference to the Swiss Bear bar is for tenant\u2019s fixtures, to require the Official Arbitrator, at its own cost, to consider this item of $137,423 and to reduce it by any amount which, in the opinion of the Official Arbitrator did not represent value of the building upon the lands leased to Petrie Parking Place Ltd.\nJUDSON J. (dissenting):\u2014The Court of Appeal in reducing the arbitrator\u2019s award from $780,000 to $422,057.08, has held that he valued the interest of the city on a wrong principle and that his error was based upon a misinterpretation of the terms of the option.\nThe terms of the option are set out in full in the reasons of Spence J. There were three parcels of land involved which I will refer to as the Walker House lot, the Petrie Garage lot and the Elgin Motors lot. The city owned all three lots in fee simple subject to leases which it had granted of each property. The Walker House Hotel building was also owned by the city and is dealt with specifically in the option and the price for its transfer settled. The buildings on the other two lots were owned by two lessees who were separate companies. The two leases gave right of renewal and certain rights of compensation for the buildings if the city refused a renewal, as it had the right to do.\nThe occasion for the granting of the option, as the correspondence between J.D. Crashley and the city indicates, was that three companies interested in these three parcels of land were coming under common control. The arbitrator\u2019s finding on this point is stated in the following extract from his reasons: At all material times all the shares of W.H. Hotel Limited and Elgin Motors Limited were owned by Mr. John Douglas Crashley, who was President of these companies. As to Petrie\u2019s Parking Place Limited, in 1956 the controlling interest in this company was held by Mr. Crashley\u2019s father, and the son had about 300 or 400 shares in his name as nominee for his father, out of 2442 issued; by the time of the arbitration Mr. Crashley Jr. had acquired all but 398 shares and he had an agreement to purchase this remaining number.\nWhat the city has to sell under this option is not in doubt. It was the complete interest in the Walker House property\u2014land and buildings\u2014and the reversionary interest in the Petrie garage lot and the Elgin Motors lot until the leases fell in and were not renewed. If the option was exercised before these two leases fell in the city would fulfil its obligation by executing a conveyance of the fee\u2014land and buildings in the Walker House property and a conveyance of the fee together with an assignment of the two leases in the case of the other two properties. If the option was exercised after these leases fell in, the price was to be increased by whatever sum the city had been compelled to pay as compensation for the buildings on a refusal to renew.\nThe price during the first period was $417,081 plus an agreed sum for the Walker House building, which at the date of the award was $282,143.92. This figure of $417,081 is one of the few certainties in the case. It was arrived at by assigning a value of $1,522 per foot frontage for the Walker House lot and $1,200 per foot frontage for the other two lots. If the option was exercised after February 1, 1958, the price was to be settled by agreement or by arbitration.\nThe arbitrator was confronted by two distinct methods of valuation. The city\u2019s expert, R.A. Davis, assumed a site that was vacant land and unencumbered. He valued this at $989,000. He broke this sum up into two, the city\u2019s interest as lessor at $881,000, and the lessees\u2019 interests of $108,000 for the unexpired terms. The other expert, J.S. Stewart, took a different approach. He valued the whole site, land and buildings, in fee simple, without leases or encumbrances, at $1,155,000. Then he deducted four items totalling $775,000. These were the value of the garage under the Petrie lease, the agreed value of the Walker House building, the cost of the Swiss Bear Bar, and the value of the Elgin building. This gave him a figure of $380,000 as the market value of the city\u2019s interest in the whole site (excluding buildings). Then he had to add to this figure the depreciated value of the Walker House property, $282,143.92, giving a total amount to be paid by the Walker House Company of $662,000.\nThe differences between the two appraisals, supposedly of the same thing, are serious, even startling\u2014on the one side $881,000 and on the other, $320,000, and this for land in the centre of the City of Toronto. A comparison of the appraisals when it is broken down and dealt with lot by lot shows how this came about.\nValuation of city\u2019s reversionary\nDAVIS:\ninterest in land only\nWalker House lot.......................\n$353,525.00\n(based on $30 per square foot)\nPetrie lot.....................................\n415,465.00\n(based on $22.50 per square foot)\nElgin Motors lot.........................\n112,365.00\nTOTAL..................................\n881,355.00\nSTEWART:\nLand and\nBuildings\nBuildings\nLand\nWalker House\n$542,000.00\n$282,143.92\n$259,936.08\nGarage\n$336,000\nPetrie..................................\n514,000.00\nSwiss\nBear\nBar........\n137,423\n473,423.00\n40,577.00\nElgin....................................\n99,000.00\n19,600.00\n79,400.00\nTOTAL................................\n$1,155,000.00\nThe frontage of the three lots from east to west were (a) Walker House 112 feet; (b) Petrie, 165.42 feet; (c) Elgin Motors 40 feet. Each lot had the same depth. Taking Davis\u2019 calculation and using round figures one begins to wonder at valuations of land for these contiguous parcels at $260,000, $40,500 and $79,400. It is evident that much of the difference between the two appraisers is to be found in their treatment of the Elgin property. According to Stewart, more than 9\/10 of the value of this property is to be attributed to buildings and I say without hesitation that this is totally unacceptable to me as is the residual valuation of $40,500 for the land. I can well understand why the arbitrator rejected Stewart\u2019s mode of valuation and preferred that of Davis, and when he did so he was not in error. I cannot understand where Stewart got his initial figure of $1,155,000 for the whole property\u2014land and buildings. I cannot see how this figure comes from his analysis of other sales which he thought comparable. He is simply telling the arbitrator that a person who wanted to buy a hotel, an appendant bar room, a parking garage and a small office building, together with the land having a frontage of 317.42 feet, would pay this sum, having in mind that redevelopment was 10 years away. To me and probably to the arbitrator, this is a meaningless estimate, and when it results in a valuation of $40,500 for the Petrie frontage of 165.42 feet, it is worse than that.\nThe arbitrator was rightly suspicious of a valuation of $336,000 for the parking garage. Stewart began with a figure of $298,776, which was an engineer\u2019s estimate of cost of reproduction less accrued depreciation. He increased this figure to $336,000 because of a sub-lease made by the Petrie Company to the Avis Company. The arbitrator\u2019s criticism of the engineer\u2019s estimate was that it made no provision for obsolescence. This was an obvious criticism with a building of this kind, the shell of which was more than 60 years old and the inside 25 years old. In addition, the Petrie company had assumed to grant a sub-lease to Avis for a period much in excess of its own unexpired term. It is true that it had a right of renewal or compensation on a refusal to renew but the granting of a precarious sub-lease does not increase the right to increased compensation. I am not overlooking the fact that if the head lease had been renewed, any increased ground rent was the responsibility of Avis and not Petrie, but the problem of an increased ground rent and its effect upon land valuation was only three years away and was ignored by the appraiser.\nStewart\u2019s valuation of the Swiss Bear Bar is equally open to question. It is not a valuation but a mere repetition of a cost figure. It was built on Petrie land and leased by the Petrie Company to the Walker House Hotel. Its only utility was as an appendage to the hotel and yet he deducted the whole cost from his breakdown figure of $514,000 for the Petrie property. Stewart\u2019s valuation takes no account of the fact, which was generally admitted, that these buildings had but a limited life. Crashley had begun his negotiations with the city, intending an immediate redevelopment. According to all the evidence he was 10 years too soon.\nI do not think that the arbitrator was in error in his interpretation of the agreement. What he had to ascertain was the price for the land. He was not concerned with buildings unless he was compelled to accept Stewart\u2019s method of valuation. With the exercise of the option in December 1962, the buildings would become the problem of the optionee company, W.H. Hotel Limited, when it took an assignment of the leases on the Petrie and Elgin lots. It then became the landlord and would have to decide whether to renew the leases or pay for the buildings. There was, in fact, no problem because of the common control of the three companies and it was never expected that there would be. Further, if the option had been exercised after the expiry of the Petrie and Elgin leases, whatever sum the city had been compelled to pay by way of compensation for the buildings would have been payable by the optionee company in addition to the value of the land.\nI would allow the appeal with costs both here and in the Court of Appeal and restore the arbitrator\u2019s award.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, JUDSON J. dissenting.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W.R.

The two appellant companies sought, by way of petition of right, to recover sales tax paid under protest on a product in biscuit form sold and advertized for sale as a \"limited calorie meal plan for weight control\" under the trade mark \"Limmits\". The appellants claimed that these biscuits were exempt from sales tax as \"foodstuff\", more particularly as \"bakers' biscuits or other similar articles\", by reason of s. 32 and Schedule III of the Excise Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 100. The Crown contended that \"Limmits\" were subject to sales tax as \"pharmaceuticals\". The Exchequer Court dismissed the petition of right and ruled that \"Limmits\" were taxable. The taxpayers appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Ritchie J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Abbott, Martland, Judson and Spence JJ.: The product \"Limmits\" was subject to sales tax. To be exempt from sales tax, a product must be a specific article described in Schedule III of the Excise Tax Act; in the present case, it had to be a \"bakers' biscuit\" or a \"similar article\". It had to be the ordinary product of the baker's art. It was certain that \"Limmits\" was not such a product. These biscuits were three times more expensive than baker's biscuits. They were advertised and sold not as a sweet or confection but as an elaborate, calorie-restricted meal for the purpose of reducing weight. Although manufactured by a baking company, they were produced for and under the specific direction of the appellants pursuant to a detailed formula supplied by them with ingredients compounded and provided by them, one of which was an inert appetite depressant.\nPer Ritchie J., dissenting: Section 2(1) (cc) of the Excise Tax Act, by defining the meaning which Parliament intended to be attached to the word \"pharmaceutical\", does not have the effect of creating a distinct class of substance in contradistinction to and exclusion of the \"foodstuffs\" described in Schedule III. The character of a product for the purpose of entitling it to an exemption as a \"foodstuff\" under the Schedule is in no sense altered by the way in which it is sold or represented by the manufacturer or by the price charged for it. The product \"Limmits\" was a \"bakers' biscuit\" or at least a \"similar article\".\nRevenu\u2014Taxe de vente\u2014P\u00e9tition de droit pour r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer la taxe pay\u00e9e sous prot\u00eat\u2014Produit di\u00e9t\u00e9tique \u00ab Limmits \u00bb\u2014Produit est-il exempt comme \u00ab denr\u00e9e alimentaire \u00bb ou taxable comme \u00ab produit pharmaceutique \u00bb\u2014Loi sur la taxe d'accise, S.R.C. 1952, c. 100, arts. 2(1)(cc), 30, 32, et Annexe III.\nLes deux compagnies appelantes ont cherch\u00e9, au moyen d'une p\u00e9tition de droit, \u00e0 r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer la taxe de vente qu'elles avaient pay\u00e9e sous prot\u00eat sur un produit sous forme de biscuit qu'elles vendaient sous la marque de commerce \u00ab Limmits \u00bb et qu'elles annon\u00e7aient comme \u00e9tant un r\u00e9gime amaigrissant \u00e0 calories limit\u00e9es.

II devait \u00eatre le produit ordinaire de I'art du boulanger. II est certain que le produit \u00ab Limmits \u00bb n'est pas un tel produit. Ces biscuits sont trois fois plus dispendieux que les biscuits de boulanger. Ils sont annonc\u00e9s et vendus non pas comme une sucrerie ou une friandise, mais comme \u00e9tant un mets \u00e0 calories restreintes dont le but est de faire perdre du poids.

Appel rejet\u00e9, le Juge Ritchie \u00e9tant dissident.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Dumoulin J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada[2], holding that the product \"Limmits\" was subject to sales tax. Appeal dismissed, Ritchie J. dissenting.\nHon. R. L. Kellock, Q.C., and J.C.C. Chipman, for the appellants.\nC. R. O. Munro, Q.C., and D. H. Aylen, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Abbott, Martland, Judson and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014In these proceedings, which are by way of petition of right, the two Pfizer Companies seek to recover sales tax paid under protest. The Customs and Excise Division began to exact this tax following a declaration of the Tariff Board in March of 1963, which held that \"Metrecal\", a product similar to the one with which we are here concerned, was not exempt from sales tax. The judgment of the Exchequer Court[3] was that the tax was payable. In my opinion this judgment should be affirmed.\nThe tax is imposed by s. 30 of the Excise Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 100, which reads as follows:\n30. (1) There shall be imposed, levied and collected a consumption or sales tax of eight per cent on the sale price of all goods\n(a) produced or manufactured in Canada.\nIn addition to this sales tax there is a 3 per cent old age security tax collected with it, making a combined tax of 11 per cent. This is imposed by R.S.C. 1952, c. 200, s. 10.\nTo be exempt the product must come within Schedule III of the Excise Tax Act and the appropriate part of the schedule reads:\nBakers' cakes and pies including biscuits, cookies or other similar articles;\nIn 1963 the following words were added after \"similar article\nbut not including simulated chocolate bars or candy bars;\nThe addition of these words does not affect the decision in this case.\nThe product in question is sold under the trade mark \"Limmits\" Pfizer claims that it is a food product in biscuit form sold and advertised for sale as a \"limited calorie meal plan for weight control\". It was made and baked for Pfizer by Christie, Brown and Co. Limited, who are bakers. The baker receives its manufacturing instructions from Pfizer but not all the information as to the contents of the biscuit is communicated to the baker. Several of the ingredients are referred to by code letter alone.\nIn the reasons for judgement of Dumoulin J., there is a full reproduction of the material appearing on the packet of biscuits, including directions and a description of the composition of the product. Briefly, two biscuits are recommended to replace breakfast or lunch, together with tea or coffee, but no cream. The object is to provide a nutritious, satisfying, calorie-limited meal in biscuit form with the object of losing weight. The contents are described in the following paragraph:\nContents: This package contains 6 Limmits. Each biscuit weighing 1.14 oz. contains soya, baking and whole meal flour, sugar, malt extract, glucose syrup, powdered milk, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (50 mg.) and the following essential minerals and vitamins: vitamin A (as palmitate) 894 I.U.; vitamin B1 0.31 mg.; riboflavin (vitamin B2) 0.52 mg.; vitamin C 10.74 mg; niacinamide 3.1 mg.; calcium (as dibasic calcium phosphate) 115.4 mg.; phosphorus (as dibasic calcium phosphate) 88.6 mg.; iron (as reduced iron) 2.5 mg.\nAn important ingredient mentioned is \"carboxymethyl cellulose\". This is described as \"a bulking agent\" without nutritional value which swells in the stomach and gives a feeling of fullness.\nThere is nothing distinctive about the shell of the biscuits. They are like other biscuits in this respect. Their peculiarity is to be found in the contents above described. I have real doubt whether they can be described as biscuits at all. I think this word means the ordinary, everyday product. But of this I am sure, they are not \"bakers' biscuits\". They are three times more expensive than bakers' biscuits. They are advertised and sold not as a sweet or confection but as an elaborate, calorie-restricted meal for the purpose of reducing weight. Although manufactured by a baking company, they are produced for and under the specific direction of Pfizer pursuant to a detailed formula supplied by Pfizer with ingredients compounded and provided by that company. Further, as already mentioned, a number of the ingredients are kept secret from the baking company. It is quite true that many foods are now sold with vitamins and other chemicals added. But to me the inert appetite depressant \"sodium carboxymethyl cellulose\" and its function to create the impression of fullness makes it impossible to hold that this product is a \"bakers' biscuit\".\nIt is unnecessary to go further than this. It is neither a \"bakers' biscuit\" nor a \"similar article\". Dumoulin J. put his judgment on three grounds. This is the only one I need to consider.\nIt is important to realize that under the Excise Tax Act all goods produced or manufactured in Canada are subject to tax. The exempting section 32(1) provides that\n32. (1) The tax imposed by section 30 does not apply to the sale or importation of the articles mentioned in Schedule III.\nIt is not enough that a product may be described as a \"foodstuff\". To be exempt is must be a specific article described in Schedule III. The fact that one of the sections in Schedule III is headed \"Foodstuffs\" does not govern the decision. The article in question here must be a \"bakers' biscuit\" or a \"similar article\". This means the ordinary is not product of the bakers' art and it is certain that this article is not such a product.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nRITCHIE J. (dissenting):\u2014I have had the advantage of reading the reasons for judgment of my brother Judson in which he has outlined the circumstances giving rise to this appeal and has cited the provisions of the Excise Tax Act pursuant to which the appellants claim exemption for their products.\nThe question to be determined on this appeal, as I see it, is whether the appellants' products, which are sold under the trade name \"Limmits\", are disentitled to the exemption from sales tax which is extended to \"bakers' \u2026biscuits \u2026or other similar articles\" as \"foodstuffs\" within the meaning of Schedule III of the Excise Tax Act, by reason of the following facts:\n(a) That they are sold or represented for use in the treatment, mitigation or prevention of a disorder or abnormal physical state in man, namely overweight;\n(b) that they are produced for, and under the specific direction of, the appellants pursuant to a detailed chemical formula prescribed by them and for which they supply the ingredients.\nIn summarizing his reasons for deciding that \"Limmits\" were not \"foodstuffs\" within the meaning of the Excise Tax Act, Mr. Justice Dumoulin concluded in the following terms:\nAbove all else, the 'suprema ratio decidendi' is that 'Limmits', pursuant to the clear language of paragraph (cc), s-s. (1) of s. 2, are 'sold or represented' in such a way, and intended to secure specified results that unmistakably stamp them with the statutory qualifications of 'pharmaceuticals'.\nThe relevant provisions of s. 2(1) of the Act read as follows:\n(cc) 'pharmaceuticals' means any material, substance, mixture, compound or preparation, of whatever composition or in whatever form, sold or represented for use in the diagnosis, treatment, mitigation or prevention of a disease, disorder, abnormal physical state, or the symptoms thereof, in man or animal, or for restoring, correcting or modifying organic functions in man or animal; \u2026\nIn the course of his reasons for judgment, Mr. Justice Dumoulin placed the following interpretation on the words \"sold or represented\" as they occur in this subsection:\nIn my humble opinion those three governing words have paramount sway over the Act and are mandatory unless superseded by an exception, expressed or logically inferred.\nIt was convincingly shown, I believe, that the particular products, in biscuit form, called Limmits, were 'sold or represented' to the public at large precisely in the manner and for the purposes forseen by s. 2(1) (cc). How, then, could they escape the consumption taxes of eight percent and two percent imposed, respectively, by the Excise Tax and Old Age Security Acts?\nLater in his judgment, the learned judge explained what he found to be the mandatory condition of the tax exemption in Schedule III in the following terms\nThe determining, decisive, factor does not consist in the quantity of vitamins contained in, or calories excluded from, an edible substance; it is set and prescribed by the interpretative authority of s. 2(1) (cc) decreeing that: must be considered 'pharmaceuticals', unmentioned in Schedule III, 'any material, substance, mixture, compound or preparation, of whatever composition or in whatever form, sold or represented for use in the\u2026treatment, mitigation or prevention of a \u2026disorder (or) abnormal physical state \u2026in man'.\nWith the greatest respect for those who may hold a different view, I do not regard the subsection to which Mr. Justice Dumoulin refers as effective to do more than to define the meaning which Parliament intended to be attached to the word \"pharmaceutical\" as it is used from time to time in the Excise Tax Act, and I do not think that it has the effect of creating a distinct class of substance in contra-distinction to and exclusion of the \"foodstuffs\" described in Schedule III. If the definition of \"pharmaceutical\" had this effect it would mean, in my view, that \"foodstuffs\" which would otherwise come within the exemption provided by that Schedule would, if they were sold or represented for \"use in \u2026modifying organic functions in man or animal\", cease to be \"foodstuffs\" for the purpose of the statute. It occurs to me that this would mean, for example, that upon a manufacturer representing that a particular \"foodstuff\" was beneficial for use by those suffering from indigestion, the product so represented would cease to be a \"foodstuff\" within the meaning of the schedule and would become subject to excise tax as a \"pharmaceutical\". In my opinion the character of the product for the purpose of entitling it to an exemption as a \"foodstuff\" under Schedule III is in no sense altered by the way in which it is sold or represented by the manufacturer or by the price charged for it.\nThe appellants' products are baked by a bakery company and each consists of two small biscuits between which is inserted a flavoured filling prepared according to a formula supplied by the appellants which contains chemical constituents, including the appetite depressant, sodium car-boxymethylcellulose.\nAlthough it is not expressly admitted that the so-called shells on each side of the filling are the same as the shell of any ordinary biscuit, the description given on behalf of the appellants by S.A.B. Dean remains uncontradicted. That witness said:\nThe shells of the biscuit are baked in equipment used for the manufacture of all other types of biscuits; and the ingredients that enter into the process are of necessity the same type of ingredients that go into ordinary everyday biscuits\u2026\nIt is, however, contended on behalf of the respondent that the chemical constituents of the filling distinguish the product from the usual bakers' biscuits and exclude it from the class of \"Foodstuffs\" prescribed by Schedule III of the Excise Tax Act.\nThe class of \"Foodstuffs\" under which the exemption is here sought is described in the Schedule as \"bakers' cakes and pies, including biscuits, cookies or other similar articles\" (the italics are my own). While I agree that the special properties contained in the filling which is inserted between the two small biscuits in the preparation of \"Limmits\" differentiate them from ordinary \"bakers' biscuits\", I am nevertheless of the opinion, with the greatest respect for those who hold a different view, that the effect of inserting the prepared filling is to make the finished products a somewhat unusual type of \"bakers' biscuits\" with special dietary qualities which are said to aid in the treatment of obesity, but that they remain \"bakers' biscuits\" and as such are exempt under the Schedule. Even if I were not satisfied that \"Limmits\" were \"bakers' biscuits\" within the meaning of the Statute, I would not be prepared to say that, baked as they are in a baker's oven with two sides which are indistinguishable from ordinary \"bakers' biscuits\" they are not, at least, \"similar\" to such biscuits and therefore \"similar articles\" within the meaning of the Schedule and entitled to the exemption for which provision is made under s. 32(1) of the Excise Tax Act, which also applies to the tax imposed by the Old Age Security Act.\nI would accordingly allow this appeal and order that the Pfizer Corporation is entitled to recover from the respondent the sum of $15,818.44 and that the Pfizer Company Limited is entitled to recover the sum of $43,417.18 being the amounts paid under the Excise Tax Act and the Old Age Security Act by way of sales tax and Old Age Security tax in respect of these products between February 25, 1963, and January 31, 1964, together with interest on both amounts at the rate of five percent from the date of service of the petition of right herein.\nI would award the appellants their costs in this Court and in the Exchequer Court.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, RITCHIE J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Howard, Cate, Ogilvy, Bishop, Porteous and Hansard, Montreal.\nSolicitor for the respondent: E.

The defendant company contended that \"Metrecal\" was exempt from sales tax as \"foodstuff\" by reason of s. 32 and Schedule III of the Excise Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 100. Before the Exchequer Court, the Crown argued that the Court did not have jurisdiction to decide whether or not \"Metrecal\" in powder form was exempt because the Tariff Board, in 1963, had declared that this product was subject to sales tax as \"pharmaceutical\", and leave to appeal that decision had already been refused by the same Court. The Exchequer Court held that it was still open for a judge of the Court in other proceedings to make a finding contrary to the finding of the Tariff Board and ruled that \"Metrecal\" in all its forms was not subject to sales tax. The Crown appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Ritchie J. dissenting in part): The appeal should be allowed.\nPer curiam: The declaration of the Tariff Board that \"Metrecal\" in powder form was taxable was final and conclusive and was not subject to review by the Court.<\/s>\nPer Abbott, Martland, Judson and Spence JJ.: The (product \"Metrecal\" in all its forms was not exempt from sales tax. The product was similar to and competed with the product dealt with in the Pfizer case (ante p. 449), and the present case could be decided on the same grounds. As held in the Pfizer case, it was not enough that the product should be a \"foodstuff\". To be exempt \"Metrecal\" had to be a \"foodstuff\" that came within a specific definition in Schedule III of the Excise Tax Act. In biscuit form, \"Metrecal\" was not a \"bakers' biscuit\". In powder form, it was not a base or concentrate for making a food beverage. In liquid form, it was not a drink prepared from milk or eggs. In soup form, it was still \"Metrecal\", not a soup.\nPer Ritchie J., dissenting in part: The fact that this product may be \"sold or represented\" for one or more of the purposes described in s. 2(1) (cc) of the Excise Tax Act necessarily excludes it from exemption from sales tax if it comes within any other classes of \"foodstuffs\" which are described in Schedule III of the Act. \"Metrecal\" as soup, wafer and liquid was included in the classifications described under \"foodstuffs\" in Schedule III and were therefore exempt from tax.\nRevenu\u2014Taxe de vente\u2014Produit di\u00e9t\u00e9tique \u00ab Metrecal \u00bb\u2014Produit est-il exempt comme \u00ab denr\u00e9e alimentaire \u00bb ou taxable comme \u00ab produit pharmaceutique \u00bb\u2014Juridiction de la Cour de I'\u00c9chiquier re: d\u00e9cision pr\u00e9alable de la Commission du Tarif dont il n'y a pas eu appel\u2014Loi sur la taxe d'accise, S.R.C. 1952, c. 100, arts. 2(1)(cc), 30, 32, 57, 58, et Annexe III.\nLa Couronne a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 une taxe de vente sur un produit di\u00e9t\u00e9tique connu sous le nom de \u00ab Metrecal \u00bb et confectionn\u00e9 par la compagnie d\u00e9fenderesse sous les formes de poudre, biscuit, liquide et soupe.

Devant la Cour de I'\u00c9chiquier, la Couronne a soutenu que la Cour n'avait pas juridiction pour d\u00e9cider de la question \u00e0 savoir si le produit \u00ab Metrecal \u00bb sous forme de poudre \u00e9tait exempt parce que la Commission du Tarif, en 1963, avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que ce produit \u00e9tait sujet \u00e0 la taxe de vente comme \u00e9tant un \u00ab produit pharmaceutique \u00bb, et que permission d'en appeler de cette d\u00e9cision avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9e par la m\u00eame Cour. La Cour de I'\u00c9chiquier a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'un juge de la Cour dans un autre proc\u00e8s pouvait encore d\u00e9clarer le contraire de ce que la Commission du Tarif avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9, et a jug\u00e9 que le produit \u00ab Metrecal \u00bb sous toutes ses formes n'\u00e9tait pas sujet \u00e0 la taxe de vente. La Couronne en appela devant cette Cour.\nArr\u00eat: L'appel doit \u00eatre maintenu, le Juge Ritchie \u00e9tant dissident en partie.\nPar la Cour: La d\u00e9claration de la Commission du Tarif que le produit \u00ab Metrecal \u00bb sous forme de poudre \u00e9tait taxable, \u00e9tait une d\u00e9claration finale et p\u00e9remptoire et n'\u00e9tait pas sujette \u00e0 revision par la Cour.\nLes Juges Abbott, Martland, Judson et Spence: Le produit \u00ab Metrecal \u00bb sous toutes ses formes n'\u00e9tait pas exempt de la taxe de vente.

Tel que d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans la cause de Pfizer, il n'\u00e9tait pas suffisant que le produit soit une \u00ab denr\u00e9e alimentaire \u00bb. Pour \u00eatre exempt\u00e9, le produit \u00ab Metrecal \u00bb devait \u00eatre une \u00ab denr\u00e9e alimentaire \u00bb qui tombait sous une d\u00e9finition sp\u00e9cifique de l'Annexe III de la Loi sur la taxe d'accise.

Appel maintenu, le Juge Ritchie \u00e9tant dissident en partie.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Gibson J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada[2], declaring that the product \"Metrecal\" was not subject to sales tax. Appeal allowed, Ritchie J. dissenting in part.\nC. R. O. Munro, Q.C., and D. H. Aylen, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nHon. R. L. Kellock, Q.C., and N. M. Simpson, Q.C., for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of Abbott, Martland, Judson and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014The judgment of the Exchequer Court[3] in this case decides that the product known as \"Metrecal\", whether in the form of powder, liquid, biscuit or soup, is not subject to sales tax. This was decided before the judgment of the same Court in the Pfizer[4] case. There is obvious conflict between the two judgments. As far as the biscuit is concerned, I repeat what I said in the Pfizer case, that the biscuit containing Metrecal is not a \"bakers' biscuit\" and as such, within the exemption of Schedule III. It is unnecessary to repeat what I said about the composition of the product in the Pfizer case. Metrecal is a similar and competing product. The Tariff Board on February 25, 1963, in proceedings instituted by Mead Johnson of Canada Ltd., the present respondent, declared that Metrecal in powder form was subject to sales tax.\nThese proceedings were taken under s. 57(1) of the Excise Tax Act, which reads:\n57. (1) Where any difference arises or where any doubt exists as to whether any or what rate of tax is payable on any article under this Act and there is no previous decision upon the question by any competent tribunal binding throughout Canada, the Tariff Board constituted by the Tariff Board Act may declare what amount of tax is payable thereon or that the article is exempt from tax under this Act.\nSection 57(3) makes a declaration by the Tariff Board final and conclusive subject to a right of appeal given by s. 58 on a question of law provided leave to appeal is granted by the Exchequer Court or a Judge thereof. Leave to appeal was refused on May 1, 1963.\nThere can be no question that the Tariff Board was within its jurisdiction in making this declaration. The question of jurisdiction which arose in Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company of Canada Limited v. T. Eaton Co. Ltd.[5] does not arise here. By the terms of the Act the declaration of the Tariff Board is final and conclusive.\nHowever, the judgment under appeal holds that Metrecal in all its forms is not subject to sales tax and that it is still open for a Judge of the Exchequer Court in other proceedings to make a finding contrary to the finding of the Tariff Board. The judgment also holds that Metrecal is a foodstuff, that it is not a pharmaceutical and that even if it is a pharmaceutical, the fact that it is also a foodstuff exempts it from tax. The ratio is contained in the following paragraph of the reasons for judgment:\nIn any event, however, irrespective of whether the various forms of \"Metrecal\" are pharmaceuticals, the fact that they are also foodstuffs within Schedule III to the Excise Tax Act in my opinion exempts them from sales tax. It is my respectful opinion that, on a true interpretation of the Act, once it is found that an article is a foodstuff, then in order for it not to be exempt from taxation by reason of its being a pharmaceutical also there would have to be in Schedule III or elsewhere in the Act clear words denying the article exemption from sales tax by the employment of such words as \"other than a pharmaceutical\", as was done in the case of farm and forest products listed in Schedule III. In my opinion, the error in this ratio is that it is not enough that the product should be a foodstuff. Before it can be exempt, it must be found to be a foodstuff that comes within a specific definition in Schedule III. In biscuit form it is not a \"bakers' biscuit\". In powder form it is not a base or concentrate for making a food beverage. In liquid form it is not a drink prepared from milk or eggs. In soup form it is still \"Metrecal\", not a soup. The case can therefore be decided on the same grounds as those delivered in this Court in the case of Pfizer.\nIt is true that the Tariff Board when it held that \"Metrecal Powder\" was subject to tax said that it was a pharmaceutical. I have already stated that I think that this finding was conclusive. But whether or not the case had ever been before the Tariff Board, the result would be the same. I think that \"Metrecal\" in all its forms is not within Schedule III.\nI would allow the appeal with costs both here and in the Exchequer Court. Judgment should be entered for the amount of taxes claimed and the penalties in accordance with s. 48(4) of the Act.\nRITCHIE J. (dissenting in part):\u2014I have had the privilege of reading the reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice Judson who has outlined the circumstances giving rise to this appeal and I agree with him that the refusal of the learned President of the Exchequer Court to grant leave to appeal to that Court in respect of the respondent's claim for exemption for \"Metrecal powder\" is not reviewable in this Court in the present proceedings and that the declaration of the Tariff Board in this regard is to be treated as final and conclusive.\nMr. Justice Gibson, however, has determined in the judgment from which this appeal is taken, that the respondent's product Metrecal in the form of a soup, a biscuit and a liquid is exempt from sales tax under the provisions of s. 32 and Schedule III of the Excise Tax Act.\nAs I have indicated in the Pfizer[6] case I do not think that the fact that these products may be \"sold or represented\" for one or more of the purposes described in s. 2(1) (cc) of the Act necessarily excludes them from exemption from sales tax if they come within any of the classes of \"Foodstuffs\" which are described in Schedule III of the Act.\nIt appears to me to be convenient to deal separately with the three forms in which the product is marketed:\n1. Metrecal Soup:\nThe respondent claims that Metrecal tomato soup, split pea soup and clam chowder come within the exemption provided for \"soups\" by the terms of the Schedule. In this regard it is to be noted that more than 95 per cent of the constituents of each of these products consist of water, milk and its derivatives and tomato paste, split peas or clam meat and juice as the case may be. The remaining 5 per cent or less of the product consists mainly of a mixture of vitamins, minerals and chemicals. Mr. LeRiche, whose evidence on behalf of the respondent in this regard was uncontradicted, having testified that \"corn oil is derived from corn, 10 per cent of corn is oil\" and that butter fat is derived from milk, went on to describe the ingredients contained in the various metrecal soups as follows:\nMilk solids, derived from milk. Corn oil, the same as we said before. Butterfat, the same. Salt is a food, a pure chemical substance. Iodized salt, salt with another chemical added. Calcium caseinate, derived from milk. Vitamins, made synthetically, and minerals. Black pepper is a natural flavour. Tomato paste, derived from tomatoes. Peas, self-explanatory. Onion powder, derived from onions. Monosodium glutamate, a chemical substance which improves the flavour. Ham flavour, I don't know whether this is synthetic or not. Clam meat, minced, and potatoes, clam juice and water.\nThe product is assembled and packaged by General Milk Products Limited who are manufacturers of milk products, evaporated milk and similar products, and who supply the skim milk and butter fat to go into the Metrecal soup, while the remaining materials are supplied by the respondent company.\nIn my view, if these products contained nothing but milk and milk products, tomatoes, split peas or clam chowder and water, they would undoubtedly be \"soups\" within the meaning of the exemption contained in Schedule III and the question to be determined is whether they lose the character of a soup because certain vitamins, minerals and chemicals are added in accordance with the respondent's directions. As I have indicated, I do not think that the fact that the ingredients supplied by the respondent may be beneficial in the treatment of \"overweight\" and that the product is \"sold or represented\" as having this quality, affects the matter, and, with the greatest respect for those who hold a different view, I am further of the opinion that a product which contains such a high percentage of ingredients normally found in \"soups\" does not cease to come within that category as specified in Schedule III of the Excise Tax Act by reason of the fact that a small quantity of other ingredients is added with a view to producing the effect of controlling obesity. I am therefore of opinion that Metrecal \"soups\" are one of the \"Foodstuffs\" classified as being exempt from sales tax under the provisions of Schedule III of the Excise Tax Act.\n2. Metrecal Wafers:\nThe question of whether these so-called wafers are \"bakers' biscuits \u2026or similar articles\" within the meaning of Schedule III is almost identical with that which was considered in the Pfizer case.\nThese so-called wafers are baked in a baker's oven, cooled and packaged by George Weston Limited who are described in the evidence as \" \u2026manufacturers of bakery goods generally\u2026 cookies, biscuits, breads, cakes\". The constituents of the wafer are described by Mr. LeRiche as follows:\nSoybean protein, sir, derives from the soybean, and this would be mainly the original product. Wheat flour is the original wheat, with a great deal of the bran removed. Sugar is a chemical substance derived from either sugar-beet or sugar-cane. Calcium caseinate is a derivative from milk. Molasses is the end product or an end product in the manufacture of sugar. Corn oil is derived from corn; ten per cent of corn is oil. Coconut oil is self-explanatory. Yeast, this is derived from the brewing industry. Lecithin is a chemical that is also a food substance. Cottonseed flour is self-explanatory, and wheat bran also. Iodized salt is one of the chemical substances which are now being added to our food. Cinnamon is a spice. Ammonium bicarbonate is known as baking powder. Flavours, that is another self-explanatory item. Vitamins and minerals are orignal in foodstuffs, but now mainly synthetic.\nIt appears to me that the respondent's formula for the making of these wafers is in the nature of a recipe for the making of a biscuit which is alleged to be beneficial to those suffering from obesity. It is baked by a bakery company and I cannot see that its alleged quality as a weight reducer deprives it of its character as a \"bakers' biscuit\". Even if the chemicals, minerals and vitamins which form part of the recipe differentiate the Metrecal wafer from nearly all other \"bakers' biscuits\" in my view it nevertheless remains a \"bakers' biscuit\" or at least an article so similar thereto as to come within the phrase \"similar articles\" as used in Schedule III of the Act.\n3. Metrecal Liquid:\nThe respondent seeks exemption for this product on the ground that it comes under the category \"Drinks prepared from milk or eggs\" for which an exemption is provided by Schedule III.\nThe formula for this product specifies the following milk products in the proportions noted:\nMilk Solids, Non Fat (From fresh skim milk)\n15.7\nButterfat (From fresh whole milk or cream)\n0.6\nWater (supplied largely by the skim milk)\n78.08.\nI do not think that the words \"Drinks prepared from milk \u2026\" can be taken to mean \"drinks consisting exclusively of milk\" and I take the view that the fact that something over 90 per cent of this product is produced from milk is sufficient to bring it within the exemption. I do not think that addition of other ingredients, including flavouring, which have been supplied in accordance with the formula developed by the respondent, alters the essential quality of the drink as being one that was prepared from milk.\nAs I have indicated, I am of opinion, for the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Judson, that it was not open to Mr. Justice Gibson, nor is it open to this Court on the present appeal, to disturb the declaration made by the Tariff Board in respect to Metrecal \"powder\" and I would accordingly allow the appeal to the extent of setting aside the finding made by Mr. Justice Gibson that Metrecal \"powder\" is one of the foodstuffs listed in Schedule III and direct that the judgment herein of the Exchequer Court be varied accordingly. In all other respects I would dismiss this appeal.\nIn view of the fact that the respondent has been substantially successful it should have its costs of the appeal to this Court.\nAppeal allowed with costs, RITCHIE J. dissenting in part.\nSolicitor for the plaintiff, appellant: E.

Prior to the completion of the vote it was suggested to the Board, on behalf of the respondents, that there had been a breach of s. 12(9) of the Labour Relations Act by the employer by having increased the rates of pay of the employees before the vote was taken. This increase had been made in consequence of a collective agreement between the employer and the appellant. Subsequently, the Board cancelled its decision to hold the representation vote, ordered the destruction of the ballots and certified the respondents.\nOn an application by way of certiorari, the appellant obtained an order quashing the decision of the Board to certify the respondents and quashing the certification. On appeal this judgment was reversed. On the appeal to this Court the appellant raised two points: 1. Did the Board have power, after the representation vote had been directed by it, pursuant to s. 12(3) and after the ballots had been cast, to cancel its decision, and to certify the respondents without the result of the vote being known? 2. Did the Board act without jurisdiction or exceed its jurisdiction in doing what it did without giving notice to the appellant of its intention to cancel its decision as to the representation vote and of its intention to certify the respondents without such vote?\nHeld (Spence J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Taschereau C.J. and Martland, Judson and Hall JJ.: It appeared that the reason for the decision to hold a representation vote was in order to ascertain whether a majority of the employees in the unit wished to be represented by the respondents. Whether or not a vote for that purpose was to be held was a matter for the discretion of the Board, as provided in s. 12(3)(b). A decision to hold such a vote was not final and absolute in view of the power conferred upon the Board by s. 65(3) to reconsider \"any decision or order made by it under this Act\" and to vary or cancel such decision or order.\nThe Board had the power to cancel its direction for the taking of the representation vote, and the position was not altered because the decision to cancel was made after the ballots had been cast but before they had been counted. The Board had the power during the period between the casting of the ballots and the counting thereof to consider facts relating to the taking of the vote, and had power to cancel the vote certainly up to the time that it had been completed by the counting of the ballots.\nWhether or not the granting of the wage increase, without the permission of the Board, did or did not constitute a breach of s. 12(9), a question it was not found necessary to decide, the Board did reach the conclusion that, in view of the alteration of the conditions of employment, \"the true wishes of the employees in the unit are not likely to be disclosed by a representation vote\". This was a finding by the Board in respect of an issue of fact, which it was entitled to make. Having made that finding it had the right, under s. 65(3), to cancel its previous decision to hold a representation vote.\nOnce the decision to cancel the direction for the vote had been validly made, the position was the same as if no vote had ever been directed. In that situation, if the Board was satisfied that a majority of the employees in the unit were, at the date of application, members in good standing of the trade union, it was required by s. 12(4) to certify it. The Board was so satisfied, and stated also that it was not in doubt as to whether a majority of the employees in the unit wished to be represented by the respondents. On those findings, and in the absence of any legal requirement binding it to the outcome of the vote which it had cancelled, the certfiication of the respondents was properly made.\nAs to the question of notice, in the circumstances the Board had complied with the requirements of s. 62(8) and did not lose jurisdiction by failing to give to the appellant a fair opportunity to be heard.\nPer Spence J., dissenting: Once the Board exercising the discretion given to it by s. 12(3) had directed a representational vote it was bound by the provisions of subss. (4) and (5) to either grant or refuse certification on the basis of the result of such vote. The power granted to the Board by s. 65(3) to cancel or vary its decisions was not a power to vary the provisions of the statute. Accordingly, subs. (3) of s. 65 did not permit a variation of the exact statutory provisions of s. 12(4) and (5).\nAlso, the Board in acting to cancel the representative vote and to certify the respondents, without adequate notice having been given to the appellant of the intention to take such action, was in breach of s. 62(8) of the statute and so acted in excess of its jurisdiction. Its action should be quashed.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], reversing a judgment of Munroe J. Appeal dismissed, Spence J. dissenting.\nW. J. Wallace, for the appellant.\nA. W. Mercer, for the respondent, Labour Relations Board of British Columbia.\nR. E. Cocking, for the respondent trade unions.\nThe judgment of Taschereau C.J. and Martland, Judson and Hall JJ. was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014The appellant is a trade union. The respondents, other than the Labour Relations Board of the Province of British Columbia (hereinafter referred to as \"the Board\"), are also trade unions and are hereinafter referred to as \"the respondents\". The matter in dispute relates to the certification by the Board of the respondents as bargaining representative for employees of Zeballos Iron Mines Limited (hereinafter referred to as \"the company\") for whom the appellant had previously been the bargaining representative.\nThe appellant had been certified by the Board on May 2, 1961, and a collective agreement between the appellant and the company was in existence at the times material to these proceedings. On January 27, 1964, notice was given by the appellant to the company to commence collective bargaining, and thereafter meetings were held between representatives of the appellant and of the company. Presumably this notice was given under s. 17 [rep. & sub. 1961, c. 31, s. 13] of the Labour Relations Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 205, which provides as follows:\n17. Either party to a collective agreement, whether entered into before or after the coming into force of this Act, may, within three months and not less than two months immediately preceding the date of expiry of the agreement, by written notice require the other party to the agreement to commence collective bargaining.\nOn or about March 23, 1964, the respondents applied to the Board for certification as the bargaining representative for the same unit. This application must have been made pursuant to the provisions of s. 10(1) (c) [am. 1961, c. 31, s. 6] of the Act, which provides:\n10. (1) A trade-union claiming to have as members in good standing a majority of employees in a unit that is appropriate for collective bargaining may, subject to the regulations, apply to the Board to be certified for the unit in any of the following cases:\n(c) Where a collective agreement is in force, then only during the eleventh and twelfth months in each year of its term or of any renewal or continuation thereof, and during the last two months of the term of the agreement, except that a trade-union that is a party to the collective agreement but is not certified with respect to employees covered by the agreement may apply at any time.\nOn April 3 the registrar of the Board notified the appellant of the application by the respondents and advised that written submissions concerning the application would be considered by the Board if received by it within ten days. A written submission was made by the appellant on April 10.\nAs a result of the collective bargaining between the appellant and the company, on or about April 30 an agreement was reached as to terms to be incorporated in the renewal of the existing agreement, effective on May 1. These terms included, among other provisions, a wage increase of 15 cents an hour across the board, which went into effect on May 1, 1964.\nSection 24 of the Act provides:\n24. Each of the parties to a collective agreement shall forthwith, upon its execution, file one copy with the Minister.\nNo copy of the agreement above mentioned was filed with the Minister of Labour.\nOn June 5 the appellant received notice from the Board that a representation vote for the purpose of certification had been ordered by the Board, under s. 12 [am. 1961, c. 31, s. 7] of the Act, to be held on June 10. The relevant portions of s. 12 are as follows:\n12. (1) Where a trade-union applies for certification for a unit, the Board shall determine whether the unit is appropriate for collective bargaining, and the Board may, before certification, include additional employees in, or exclude employees from, the unit.\n(2) The Board shall make, or cause to be made, such examination of records and other inquiries as it deems necessary, including the holding of such hearings as it deems expedient to determine the merits of any application for certification, and the Board shall prescribe the nature of the evidence that the applicant shall furnish with or in support of the application, and the manner in which the application shall be made.\n(3) If the Board is in doubt\n(a) as to whether a majority of the employees in the unit were, at the date of the application, members in good standing of the trade-union making the application, the Board shall direct that a representation vote be taken;\n(b) as to whether a majority of the employees in the unit wish to be represented by the trade-union making the application, the Board may direct that a representation vote be taken.\n(4) If, on the taking of a representation vote under subsection (3), a majority of the ballots of all those eligible to vote are cast in favour of the trade-union, or if the Board is satisfied that a majority of the employees in the unit were, at the date of the application, members in good standing of the trade-union, the Board shall certify the trade-union for the employees in the unit.\n(5) If\n(a) the Board is satisfied that less than a majority of the employees in the unit were, at the date of application, members in good standing of the trade-union ; or\n(b) on the taking of a representation vote under subsection (3), less than a majority of the ballots of all those eligible to vote are cast in favour of the trade-union; or\n(c) the Board is satisfied that the trade-union has falsely represented membership in good standing,\nthe Board shall not certify the trade-union for the unit.\nOn June 10 ballots were cast by the company's employees. On the casting of the last ballot, the scrutineer for the respondents stated that he contested the vote because a violation of the Act had taken place. Thereafter, the ballot box was sealed by the returning officer, who advised that the ballots would be counted on June 19.\nOn June 12 the solicitors for the respondents wrote to the Board as follows:\nWe wish to confirm our telephone conversation of today with you wherein we advised that on behalf of the International Union of Operating Engineers, Local 115, Teamsters, Local 213 and Tunnel & Rock Workers Union, Local 168, we oppose the representative vote held on Wednesday, June 10, 1964, at Zeballos, B.C.\nWe are instructed that the application for certification by the above three Unions for a unit of employees at Zeballos Iron Mines Ltd. was made March 23, 1964. The payroll date selected was May 12, 1964, for \"all employees of Zeballos Iron Mines Ltd. except office employees\". Further delay then resulted and the vote did not take place until June 10, 1964.\nDuring the above period of time, the Company granted a substantial wage increase retroactive. Further we are instructed that negotiations between the management and Mine, Mill were actively carried on and subsequently ratified at a meeting of Mine, Mill on Company property.\nIt is our submission that the Company's violation of Section 12(9) of the Labour Relations Act and the delay in taking the vote has caused prejudice to the applicant Unions. The matter is being investigated further and as soon as we have further details, we will communicate with you. A copy of this letter was sent by the registrar of the Board to the appellant on June 19, advising that, if the appellant wished to make representations concerning the matter, they should be in the registrar's hands on or before June 29. The appellant replied to this letter on June 25 as follows:\nI am in receipt of your communication of June 19th, 1964 and the attached copy of a letter from Mr. McTaggart.\nWe wish to submit for your information that notice from the Union to commence collective bargaining was given to the Company on January 27, 1964 and acknowledged by the Company, January 31, 1964.\nCopies of this correspondence is enclosed.\nSeveral bargaining meetings were held in Vancouver and at Zeballos.\nThese meetings resulted in a substantial improvement in wages and contract provisions. This, in our opinion, can in no way be misconstrued as a violation of any Section of the Labour Relations Act.\nThe Board sent a letter to the appellant on July 10 reading as follows:\nOn May 12th, 1964, the Labour Relations Board directed that a representation vote be taken upon an application of the International Union of Operating Engineers, Local No. 115; Building Material, Construction and Fuel Truck Drivers Union Local No. 213; and Tunnel and Rock Workers, Local No. 168, to be certified for a unit employed by Zeballos Iron Mines Limited. Prior to the completion of the vote, and while the application for certification was pending, the Board was informed that the employer had, contrary to Section 12(9) of the Labour Relations Act, altered conditions of employment of the employees affected by the application.\nThe Board is satisfied that under this circumstance the true wishes of the employees in the unit are not likely to be disclosed by a representation vote and therefore, pursuant to Section 65(3) of the Labour Relations Act, it has reconsidered its decision to take the said vote and has cancelled the said decision of May 12th, 1964. It has further directed that the ballots cast on June 19th, 1964, be destroyed.\nAs the Board is satisfied that a majority of the employees in the unit were, at the date of application for certification, members in good standing of the applicant trade-unions and is not in doubt as to whether a majority of the employees in the unit wish to be represented by the applicant trade-unions, it has, pursuant to Section 12(4) of the Labour Relations Act, certified the trade-unions. A copy of the certification is enclosed.\nSections 12(9) and 65(3) [enacted 1961, c. 31, s. 37 (c)] of the Act, to which reference is made, provide as follows:\n12. (9) Where an application for certification is pending, no trade-union or person affected by the application shall declare or engage in a strike, and no employers' organization or employer shall declare a lockout, and no employer, without the written permission of the Board, shall increase or decrease rates of pay or alter any term or condition of employment of the employees affected by the application.\n65. (3) The Board may, upon the petition of any employer, employers' organization, trade-union, or other person, or of its own motion, reconsider any decision or order made by it under this Act, and may vary or cancel any such decision or order, and for the purposes of the Act the certification of a trade-union is a decision of the Board.\nThe ballots were destroyed by the returning officer on the morning of July 14, prior to the obtaining, on the afternoon of that day, of an ex parte injunction by the appellant's solicitors to restrain the destruction of the ballots. The appellant then applied, by way of certiorari, claiming that the Board lacked jurisdiction, or had exceeded its jurisdiction in granting certification other than in accordance with the outcome of the vote, and obtained an order quashing the decision of the Board to certify the respondents and quashing the certification.\nOn appeal[2] this judgment was reversed, Davey J.A. dissenting. Leave to appeal to this Court was granted by the Court of Appeal of British Columbia.\nThe appellant has raised two points on the appeal:\n1. Did the Board have power, after a representation vote had been directed by it, pursuant to s. 12(3) and after the ballots had been cast, to cancel its decision, and to certify the respondents without the result of the vote being known?\n2. Did the Board act without jurisdiction or exceed its jurisdiction in doing what it did without giving notice to the appellant of its intention to cancel its decision as to the representation vote and of its intention to certify the respondents without such vote?\nAs to the first point, the contention of the respondents is that the Board had the power to cancel its decision by virtue of s. 65(3). The appellant submits that that subsection cannot be invoked if the Board is precluded from cancelling its decision by a specific provision of the Act.\nThe issue here is as to whether the terms of s. 12(3) and (4) are to be construed so as to bind the Board, once a representation vote has been directed, to complete that vote and abide by its result, or whether the decision to take a vote, as in the case of decisions on other matters, can be cancelled or varied under s. 65(3).\nThe certification of a trade union as a bargaining representative for a unit of employees is a matter which the Act places in the hands of the Board. Under s. 12(2) it may make such examination of records and other inquiries as it deems necessary.\nA representation vote is only taken if the Board is in doubt in respect of one or other of the matters described in paras. (a) and (b) of subs. (3) of s. 12. Paragraph (a) requires a vote if the Board is in doubt as to whether a majority of the employees in the unit were, at the date of application, members in good standing of the applicant union. Paragraph (b) gives to the Board a discretion to direct a vote if it is in doubt as to whether a majority of the employees in the unit wish to be represented by the applicant trade union.\nParagraph (b) was added to s. 12 when that section was re-enacted in 1961 (Statutes of British Columbia, 1961, c. 31, s. 7). Its purpose would appear to be to enable the Board, at its discretion, to direct a representation vote even though a majority of employees in a unit are members in good standing of the applicant trade union, at the time of application, if it is in doubt as to whether a majority of the employees in that unit wish to be represented by that trade union.\nIt would appear, from the material before us, that, in the present case, the Board directed a representation vote under para (b). In its letter to the appellant, dated July 10, 1964, the Board says:\nThe Board is satisfied that under this circumstance the true wishes of the employees in the unit are not likely to be disclosed by a representation vote and therefore, pursuant to Section 65(3) of the Labour Relations Act, it has reconsidered its decision to take the said vote and has cancelled the said decision of May 12th, 1964.\n(The italics are my own.)\nThis indicates that the decision of May 12 to hold a representation vote was in order to ascertain whether a majority of the employees in the unit wished to be represented by the respondents. That this was the reason for the Board's direction is also a reasonable inference from the fact that the Board was being asked, not to certify a trade union for the first time, but to certify the respondents when there was already a certified trade union in existence.\nWhether or not a vote for that purpose was to be held was a matter for the discretion of the Board. It was a means which the Board might use in order to resolve a doubt regarding that question. A decision to hold such a vote was not, in my opinion, final and absolute in view of the power conferred upon the Board by s. 65(3) to reconsider \"any decision or order made by it under this Act\" and to vary or cancel such decision or order.\nThe scope of the power conferred under that subsection has been considered in this Court in Labour Relations Board et al. v. Oliver Co-operative Growers Exchange[3], and in Bakery and Confectionery Workers International Union of America Local No. 468 v. White Lunch Limited[4]. Both of those cases dealt with variations of an existing order, but in describing the extent of the power, Judson J., in the earlier case at p. 12, refers to it as \"a plenary independent power\" and as \"a very necessary power to enable the Board to do its work efficiently\".\nIn my opinion the Board had the power to cancel its direction for the taking of the representation vote. Nor do I think that the position is altered because the decision to cancel was made after the ballots had been cast but before they had been counted. In the present case the Board only became aware of circumstances which led it to cancel its direction after the ballots had been cast. The Board had fixed June 19 as the day for the counting of the ballots, nine days after the date which had been set for the voting. In my view, it had the power during that period to consider facts relating to the taking of the vote, and had power to cancel the vote certainly up to the time that it had been completed by the counting of the ballots. Whether or not it could have done so thereafter on the basis of irregularities in the taking of the vote, or for any other reason, is an issue which does not arise in the present case.\nThe decision of the Board to cancel the direction for the vote was made following the receipt of the letter of June 12 from the solicitors for the respondents suggesting that there had been a breach of s. 12(9) of the Act by the company by having increased the rates of pay of the employees before the vote was taken. This increase had, of course, been made from May 1 in consequence of the agreement between the company and the appellant. Sheppard J.A. in the Court below was of the opinion that s. 12(9) had no application to a wage increase granted as a consequence of collective bargaining carried on pursuant to the provisions of s. 19 of the Act, which requires the parties to a collective agreement to commence bargaining within five days after notice given by one of them under s. 17 (previously quoted). This view was shared by the other members of the Court.\nThe situation which arises where a trade union seeks certification for a unit of employees which already has a bargaining representative, which is a party to an existing collective agreement with the employer, presents problems. Under s. 17, notice to commence bargaining, where there is a collective agreement in effect, may be given within three months, but not less than two months immediately preceding the expiry date of the agreement. But under s. 10(1) the new applicant union cannot apply save in the last two months of each year of the agreement or of the term of the agreement. This means that the application for certification may often occur while collective bargaining is in progress between the employer and the trade union previously certified.\nSection 12(9) permits a pay increase with the written permission of the Board, but, otherwise, prohibits the granting of such an increase where an application for certification is pending. The application for certification by the respondents was pending on May 1, 1964, when the wage increase took effect. Section 24 requires the filing of a copy of a collective agreement forthwith, upon its execution, with the Minister.\nIn the present case no copy of the agreement of April 30, 1964, had been filed, and there is nothing to indicate that the Board was aware of the pay increase granted by the company, effective May 1, until after the votes had been cast on June 10. Whether or not the granting of the increase, without permission of the Board, did or did not constitute a breach of s. 12(9), a question which I do not find it necessary to decide, the Board did reach the conclusion that, in view of the alteration of the conditions of employment, \"the true wishes of the employees in the unit are not likely to be disclosed by a representation vote.\" This was, in my opinion, a finding by the Board in respect of an issue of fact, which it was entitled to make. Having made that finding it had the right, under s. 65(3), to cancel its previous decision to hold a representation vote. Once the decision to cancel the direction for the vote had been validly made, the position was the same as if no vote had ever been directed. In that situation, if the Board was satisfied that a majority of the employees in the unit were, at the date of application, members in good standing of the trade union, it was required by s. 12(4) to certify it. The Board was so satisfied, and stated also that it was not in doubt as to whether a majority of the employees in the unit wished to be represented by the respondents. On those findings, and in the absence of any legal requirement binding it to the outcome of the vote which it had cancelled, the certification of the respondents was properly made.\nThe only other issue is as to whether or not proper notice had been given by the Board to the appellant. Section 62(8) of the Act provides that:\n62. (8) The Board shall determine its own procedure, but shall in every case give an opportunity to all interested parties to present evidence and make representation.\nThe \"case\" in question before the Board was the application of the respondents to be certified. The Board gave notice of that application to the appellant, and gave it the opportunity to make written submissions. A written submission opposing the application was made.\nTo enable it to resolve a doubt which it then had as to whether a majority of employees in the unit wished to be represented by the respondents, the Board directed the taking of the representation vote. It received a submission from the solicitors for the respondents regarding that vote and it thereupon notified the appellant, enclosing a copy of that submission. The appellant was advised that it could make representations regarding that matter within a certain time. A written representation was made by the appellant. Thereafter the Board made its decision as to the cancellation of the representation vote and the certification of the respondents.\nI agree with the conclusion of the majority in the Court below that in these circumstances the Board did not lose jurisdiction by failing to give to the appellant a fair opportunity to be heard. The Board did comply with the requirements of s. 62(8).\nFor these reasons, in my opinion, this appeal should be dismissed, with costs to the respondent trade unions. SPENCE J. (dissenting):\u2014I have had the privilege of reading the reasons of my brother Martland and I need not repeat the facts as he has set them out with sufficient clarity.\nIn my view, the appeal should be allowed for both of the grounds raised by counsel for the appellant. Firstly, I am of the view that the Board in the exercise of its powers under s. 65(3) of the Labour Relations Act was only permitted to act where under the provisions of the statute it was given a discretion. Therefore, that section did not permit it to contravene other statutory provisions. The Board has a discretion under s. 12(1) to determine whether the trade union which applied for certification was an appropriate unit. The Board has a further discretion under subs. (2) of s. 12 to make such examinations as it deemed fit and to prescribe the nature of the evidence that the applicant should furnish in support of an application for certification. By subs. (3) of s. 12 the Board was directed, if it were in doubt as to whether the majority of the employees were at the date of the application members in good standing of the trade union making the application or whether the majority of the employees in the unit wished to be represented by that trade union, to direct a representational vote to be taken. The Board in this case found that such a doubt existed and therefore exercising the power set forth in s. 12(3) of the statute as aforesaid, directed the taking of the representational vote. By s. 12(5) (b) if, on the taking of a representational vote under subs. (3), less than the majority of the ballots of all those eligible to vote are cast in favour of the trade union the Board shall not certify the trade union for the unit.\nOn the other hand, by subs. (4) of s. 12, if, on the taking of a representational vote, a majority of the ballots of those eligible to vote were cast in favour of the trade union, then the Board shall certify the trade union for the employees in the union. I am of the opinion that once the Board exercising the discretion given to it by s. 12(3) had directed a representational vote it was bound by the provisions of subss. (4) and (5) to either grant or refuse certification on the basis of the result of such vote.\nThe power granted by s. 65(3) of the statute is, as put by Judson J. in Labour Relations Board et al. v. Oliver Co-operative Growers Exchange[5], at p. 12, a \"plenary, independent power\" and a \"very necessary power to enable the board to do its work efficiently\". It is not, however, a power to vary the provisions of the statute. I need not go so far as decisions in both British Columbia and Ontario in limiting the provisions to where no specific provision has been made by the statute, e.g. Bull J.A. in Regina v. B.C. Labour Relations Board, ex parte White Lunch Ltd.[6], at p. 80, but merely take the position that subs. (3) of s. 65 does not permit a variation of the exact statutory provisions of s. 12(4) and (5).\nI also share the view expressed by Davey J.A. in his dissenting reasons given in the Court of Appeal of British Columbia that the action of the Labour Relations Board should be quashed because no adequate notice of the intention to take such action was given to the appellant. In this case, the Court need not consider the common law principle that every person has the right to be heard and that no judicial or quasi-judicial decision should be made against him without notice, as by the very provisions of the statute, i.e. s. 62(8), \"the Board shall determine its own procedure but shall in every case give an opportunity to all interested persons to present evidence and make representation\".\nIn the present case, as my brother Martland has pointed out, on June 12, the solicitor for the respondents wrote to the Board stating that they confirmed their telephone conversation opposing the representative vote, alleging a breach of s. 12(9) of the statute, and concluding \"matter is being investigated further and as soon as we have further details we will communicate with you\". The respondent Board forwarded to the appellant a copy of that letter in its letter of June 19 advising that if the appellant wished to make representations it should do so on or before June 29. The appellant did make representations simply alleging that the action of concluding a collective agreement with the increase in wages which was included therein was part of the ordinary procedure under the statute. Then, without further notice, the Board on July 10 notified the appellant that it was cancelling the representative vote and was certifying the respondents. As Davey J.A. pointed out, the action of the Board in purporting, under s. 65(3) of the statute, to cancel its previous order for a representational vote and to certify the respondents was not part of the proceeding for such representational vote at all but was an extraordinary move to rescind something already ordered and on which the parties were entitled to rely in the absence of notice to the contrary. I adopt the statement of Davey J.A. \"But it is not too much to expect the board to give notice of proceedings to reconsider and rescind decisions already taken and promulgated, couched in language sufficiently explicit to inform a layman of what is to be considered, and the case to be met\". I am, therefore, of the opinion that the Board in acting to cancel the representative vote and to certify the respondents was in breach of s. 62(8) of the statute and so acted in excess of its jurisdiction. Its action should be quashed.\nFor these reasons, I would allow the appeal with costs against the respondent union only and direct the restoration of the order of Munroe J. made on August 24, 1964.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, SPENCE J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Bull, Housser & Tupper, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the respondent, Labour Relations Board of British Columbia: Paine, Edmonds, Mercer, Smith & Williams, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the respondent trade unions: McTaggart, Ellis, Melvin & Cocking, Vancouver.\n[1] (1965), 53 W.W.R. 385, 54 D.L.R.

In computing the \"aggregate taxable value\" within the meaning of the Act, the Minister used a method known as \"successive approximations\" to compute the amount of deduction under s. 7(1) (d). The amount of the charitable gift could not be ascertained without first knowing the estate tax payable, and, in turn, the amount of the estate tax payable depended upon the amount of the charitable gift. The Exchequer Court ruled that the method used by the Minister was the wrong one. The Minister appealed to this Court. At the hearing, the executors made the submission for the first time that the charitable deduction was the full value of the charitable residue, on the basis that the last paragraph of s. 7(1) (d) did not apply to this particular will because under the will \"no part of any estate, legacy, succession or inheritance duty\u2026is\u2026 payable out of the property comprised in such gift,\" or payable by the charity \"as a condition of the making of such gift\".\nHeld (Spence J. dissenting in part): The appeal of the Minister should be allowed.\nPer Abbott, Judson, Ritchie and Hall JJ.: The Minister's method of calculation was the correct one. The successive calculations of estate duty were required in this case because of the provisions of s. 7(1)(d), which allow as a deduction from aggregate net value of the estate only the actual value of the gift that ultimately finds its way to the charity. The will gave to the charity the residue of the estate charged with the burden of the payment of the duty. Under the Act, the Minister must value this interest, and the value of this interest for purposes of deduction from aggregate net value is to be reduced by the amount of the duties. The duties were payable out of the property comprised in the gift and were payable by the donee as a condition of the making of the gift.\nPer Spence J., dissenting in part: If s. 7(1) (d) of the Estate Tax Act applies, the course adopted by the Minister was the correct one. Under the will, the estate tax and succession duties were not directed to be payable out of the property comprised in the gift to the foundation, nor were they payable by the foundation as a condition of the making of the gift to it. What the charity was entitled to receive was the residue of the residue after performance of all trusts including the payment of taxes; it was only in the residue of the residue that the charity had any property interest. The executors were, therefore, entitled to the benefit of the exemption and were not caught by the \"minus\" provision at the end of s. 7(1)(d).\nRevenu\u2014Imp\u00f4t successoral\u2014Testament\u2014Don de charit\u00e9\u2014Paiement des droits \u00e0 m\u00eame Ie don\u2014Calcul de la d\u00e9duction permise par la Loi lorsqu'il s'agit d'un tel don\u2014Loi de I'Imp\u00f4t sur les biens transmis par d\u00e9c\u00e8s, 1958 (Can.), c. 29, s. 7(1)(d).\nPar son testament, le testateur a l\u00e9gu\u00e9 \u00e0 une organisation de charit\u00e9, dans le sens de I'art. 7(1)(d) de la Loi de I'Imp\u00f4t sur les biens transmis par d\u00e9c\u00e8s, 1958 (Can.), c. 29, le reliquat de sa succession, apr\u00e8s paiement des dettes, de tous les imp\u00f4ts successoraux et des droits de succession et apr\u00e8s avoir mis de c\u00f4t\u00e9 pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de sa famille 50 pour-cent de la balance.

Appel maintenu, le Juge Spence \u00e9tant dissident en partie.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Gibson J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada[2], setting aside an assessment made by the Minister. Appeal allowed, Spence J. dissenting in part.\nHon. R. L. Kellock, Q.C., and G. W. Ainslie, for the appellant.\nJohn J. Robinette, Q.C., for the respondents.\nThe judgment of Abbott, Judson, Ritchie and Hall JJ. was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014The question in issue in this appeal is how the Minister must compute the deduction allowed by s. 7(1) (d) of the Estate Tax Act for charitable gifts when there is a direction to pay duty out of the charitable gift.\nThe Estate Tax Act imposes a tax upon the aggregate taxable value of all property passing on the death of every person domiciled in Canada at the time of his death. Section 7(1)(d) of the Act, which provides for the deduction of charitable gifts in computing aggregate taxable value, is in the following terms:\n7. (1) For the purpose of computing the aggregate taxable value of the property passing on the death of a person, there may be deducted from the aggregate net value of that property computed in accordance with Division B such of the following amounts as are applicable:\n***\n(d) the value of any gift made by the deceased whether during his lifetime or by his will, where such gift can be established to have been absolute and indefeasible, to\n(i) any organization in Canada that, at the time of the making of the gift and of the death of the deceased, was an organization constituted exclusively for charitable purposes, all or substantially all of the resources of which, if any, were devoted to charitable activities carried on or to be carried on by it or to the making of gifts to other such organizations in Canada all or substantially all of the resources of which were so devoted, and no part of the resources of which was payable to or otherwise available for the benefit of any proprietor, member or shareholder thereof, or\n(ii) Her Majesty in the right of Canada or a province, a Canadian municipality or a municipal or other public body in Canada performing a function of government,\nminus such part of any estate, legacy, succession or inheritance duties or any combination of such duties (including any tax payable under this Part) as is, either by direction of or arrangement made or entered into by the deceased whether by his will or by contract or otherwise, or by any statute or law imposing such duties or relating to the administration of the estate of the deceased, payable out of the property comprised in such gift or payable by the donee as a condition of the making of such gift;\nThe difficulty of the problem is that the value of the charitable gift is, by definition, the value of the gift minus duty where there is a direction to pay duty out of the charitable gift. One cannot ascertain the amount of the charitable gift without first knowing the estate tax payable, and, in turn, the amount of the estate tax payable depends upon the amount of the charitable gift.\nIt is necessary to set out in outline the structure of the will. Everything is given to trustees and the only trusts with which we are concerned in the decision of this appeal are these:\n1. \"To pay out of the capital of the residue of my estate my just debts, funeral and testamentary expenses and all estate, legacy, succession and inheritance taxes or duties, whether imposed by or pursuant to the law of any domestic or foreign jurisdiction whatsoever, that may be payable by any beneficiary of this my Will or any Codicil hereto in connection with the property passing (or deemed to pass by any governing law) on my death . . .\"\n2. To set aside a sum equal to 50 per cent of the estate, such sum to be ascertained after the deduction of debts only, and debts are not to include succession duty and estate duty.\n(This trust was for the benefit of members of the family.)\n3. To pay or transfer the residue of the estate to the E. W. Bickle Foundation. The E. W. Bickle Foundation is admitted to be a charitable organization which qualifies under s. 7(1) (d). The parties agree:\n(1) that the aggregate net value of the property passing on death was $5,242,455.21;\n(2) that the value of the residue out of which the estate and succession duties were by the will directed to be paid was $2,261,847.64;\n(3) that the amount payable for Ontario succession duty was $600,212.95.\nThe Minister contends that the estate tax payable is $1,132,922.35. The figure computed by the learned trial judge1 was $1,004,994.75. The Minister arrived at his figure as a result of ten successive calculations. Under the scheme of this Act you cannot determine the value of the charitable gift until you have determined the amount of duty. It should be possible to state the Minister's proposition in such a way that an actuarial training is not needed to understand it. First of all, you have a charitable fund of determined amount which is not taxable but from which must be deducted the amount of estate duty. You first calculate the amount of the estate duty on the balance of the estate ignoring the charitable fund. This gives you the first figure that must be deducted from the charitable fund but it is not the final figure. This first calculation of duty must be transferred from the charitable fund to the taxable portion of the estate. This calculation was repeated ten times until the tenth calculation showed little or no difference from the ninth. This then was the amount of estate duty which had to be deducted from the value of the charitable gift. This is the figure that the Minister contended for and, in my opinion, the mode of calculation is correct and the one required by the Act. The evidence also indicates that the same result may be obtained by the application of an elaborate algebraic formula.\nThe learned trial judge held that the assessment was wrong because it applied succession duty principles in the computation. With respect, I do not think that this criticism is well-founded. Where a will makes a gift to a beneficiary together with the succession duty on this gift, the beneficiary must pay succession duty not only on the gift but on the gift of duty. There is no analogy between this tax and estate tax, which is a single levy not on any succession but upon the value of the whole estate. The successive calculations of estate duty are required in this case because of the provisions of s. 7(1) (d), which allows as a deduction from aggregate net value of the estate only the actual value of the gift that ultimately finds its way to the charity.\nThe learned trial judge also found that only two calculations were required by s. 7(1) (d). First you calculate the tentative estate tax without reducing the exempt gift either by estate duty or succession duty. Then you calculate the estate tax once again after reducing the exempt gift by a combination of the estate tax first found and the admitted figure for succession duty. I think that there is no justification for stopping at the first stage, having regard to the provisions of s. 7(1) (d).\nIn this Court the submission was made for the first time that the charitable deduction was the full value of the charitable residue, namely, $2,261,847.64. The basis for this submission was that the clause in s. 7(1) (d) commencing with the word \"min\u00f9s\" does not apply to this particular will because \"no part of any estate, legacy, succession or inheritance duty or any combination of such duties is \u2026 payable out of the property comprised in such gift\", or payable by the charity \"as a condition of the making of such gift\".\nI have already set out a summary of the trusts contained in the will and it is argued that what the charity is entitled to receive is the residue of the residue after performance of the trusts, including the payment of taxes, and that it is only in this residue of residue that the charity has any property interest. Therefore, these duties are not payable out of \"the property comprised in such gift\" or \"payable by the donee as a condition of the making of such a gift\".\nI do not agree with these submissions. This will gives the charity the residue of the estate charged with the burden of the payment of the duty. It is not disputed that until the trusts under a will have been performed, a residuary beneficiary cannot put his hands on a specific piece of property and claim ownership with all the consequences of ownership. This is all that the cases of Sudelay v. Attorney-General[3], and Barnardo v. Commissioners for Special Purposes of the Income Tax Acts[4] decide. In the first case foreign mortgages were comprised in a husband's estate. This estate was not fully administered when the wife, a residuary beneficiary, died. Her executors unsuccessfully contended that because she would have been ultimately entitled to an interest in these foreign mortgages, that interest was not an English asset of her estate and subject to probate duty. In Barnardo, income, on which tax had been deducted at the source, was received by executors before the estate had been administered and the residue ascertained. The charity as the residuary beneficiary claimed a refund of the tax. It was held that until the residue had been ascertained, the charity had no property in this specific investment from which this income had been derived and that the claim for a refund failed.\nThese cases, in my opinion, afford no help to anyone in the application of s. 7(1) (d). The value of the charitable gift is established at $2,261,847.64. Admittedly, this is a residuary interest and the charity cannot claim ownership in specie of any particular piece of property comprised in the estate, before the estate has been administered. What was given to the charity was the residuary interest. The Act says that the Minister must value this interest and that the value of this interest for purposes of deduction from aggregate net value will be reduced by the amount of the duties. I think that the duties are payable out of the property comprised in the gift and are payable by the donee as a condition of the making of the gift.\nI would allow the appeal with costs both here and in the Exchequer Court and direct that the assessment made by the Minister be restored.\nSPENCE J. (dissenting in part):\u2014I have had the privilege of reading the reasons of my brother Judson and agree with his view that if s. 7(1) (d) of the Estate Tax Act, Statutes of Canada 1958, c. 29, as amended by Statutes of Canada 1960. c. 29, s. 4(1) applies then the course adopted by the Minister is correct and, with respect, that adopted by Gibson J. in the Exchequer Court[5] is in error. The Estate Tax Act provides:\n7. (1) For the purpose of computing the aggregate taxable value of the property passing on the death of a person, there may be deducted from the aggregate net value of that property computed in accordance with Division B such of the following amounts as are applicable:\n***\n(d) the value of any gift made by the deceased whether during his lifetime or by his will, where such gift can be established to have been absolute and indefeasible, to\n(i) any organization in Canada that, at the time of the making of the gift and of the death of the deceased, was an organization constituted exclusively for charitable purposes, all or substantially all of the resources of which, if any, were devoted to charitable activities carried on or to be carried on by it or to the making of gifts to other such organizations in Canada all or substantially all of the resources of which were so devoted, and no part of the resources of which was payable to or otherwise available for the benefit of any proprietor, member or shareholder thereof, or\n(ii) Her Majesty in right of Canada or a province, a Canadian municipality or a municipal or other public body in Canada performing a function of government,\nminus such part of any estate, legacy, succession or inheritance duties or any combination of such duties (including any tax payable under this Part) as is, either by direction of or arrangement made or entered into by the deceased whether by his will or by contract or otherwise, or by any statute or law imposing such duties or relating to the administration of the estate of the deceased, payable out of the property comprise in such gift or payable by the donee as a condition of the making of such gift;\nTherefore, the section permits, for the purpose of computing the aggregate taxable value of the property passing, deduction of the value of any gift made by the deceased to any organization constituted exclusively for charitable purposes. By the final paragraph of the subsection, such deduction is to be reduced by such part of any estate, legacy, succession or inheritance duties as is, whether by will or contract or otherwise, payable out of the property comprised in the gift, or payable by the donee as a condition of making such gift. It is agreed that the E. W. Bickle Foundation is a charitable organization under the provisions of s. 7(1) (d) of the statute and, therefore, the executors are entitled to the deduction permitted by s. 7(1) (d) thereof.\nThe problem is whether such deduction is to be reduced by the estate taxes because of the final words of the said s. 7(1). The gift in question is set out in para. III of the Last Will and Testament of the testator as follows: III. I GIVE, DEVISE AND BEQUEATH the whole of my property of every nature and kind and wheresoever situate including any property over which I may have any general power of appointment to my said Trustees upon the following trusts, namely:\u2014\n***\n(d) To pay out of the capital of the residue of my estate my just debts, funeral and testamentary expenses and all estate, legacy, succession and inheritance taxes or duties, whether imposed by or pursuant to the law of any domestic or foreign jurisdiction whatsoever, that may be payable by an beneficiary of this my Will or any Codicil hereto in connection with the property passing (or deemed to pass by any governing law) on my death or in connection with any insurance and\/or annuities on my life or in connection with any gift or benefit given or provided by me either in my lifetime to or for any such beneficiary, or by survivorship, or by this my Will or any Codicil thereto, or to or for the benefit of any beneficiary of any trust or settlement created by me during my lifetime, and whether such taxes and duties be payable in respect of estates or interests which fall into possession at my death or at any subsequent time; and I hereby authorize my Trustees to commute or prepay any such taxes or duties.\n(e) To set aside a sum equal to fifty per centum (50%) of my estate. For the purpose of determining the sum to be so set aside, my estate shall be deemed to comprise all property which by paragraph III of this my Will I give, devise and bequeath to my Trustees less any debts (but such debts shall not include any succession duties or estate taxes) owing by me at my death and the value to be placed on such property shall be the value thereof as fixed for the purposes of the Ontario Succession Duty Act or, if no such Act is in force at the time of my death, the value thereof as fixed for the purposes of The Canada Estate Tax Act. The sum so set aside shall be disposed of as follows:\n***\n(f) To pay or transfer the residue of my estate to E. W. Bickle Foundation.\nIn my view, the testator has directed first that there be paid out of his estate the debts and succession duties. Secondly, the testator has directed his executors to divide equally the whole estate less debts but not succession or other estate duties into two halves, and has dealt with the first half as set out in para. (e) and directed the payment of the second half to the E. W. Bickle Foundation. The only gift, therefore, to the respondents is a gift after the payment of the debts and the payment of all succession, legacy, and estate duties. It is true that the duties are to be paid from \"the second half\" of the residue as so decided but they are to be paid, by the provisions of para. III (d) of the Will before any amount is to be payable to either the beneficiary under para. III (e) or the E. W. Bickle Foun- dation under para. III (f). Therefore, in my view, such \"estate, legacy, succession or inheritance duties\" were not directed by the will to be payable out of the property comprised in the gift to the foundation, nor were they payable by the foundation as a condition of the making of the gift to it.\nI agree with the statement made by counsel for the respondents in his factum\u2014\"What the charity is entitled to receive is the residue of the residue after performance of all trusts including the payment of taxes; it is only in the residue of the residue that the charity has any property interest\". In reaching this conclusion, I have not considered as particularly applicable either Sudeley v. Attorney General[6] or Bernardo v. Commissioners for Special Purposes of the Income Tax Acts[7]. I have simply interpreted the words of s. 7(1) of the Estate Tax Act and of the testator's last Will in their ordinary grammatical sense. It might well have been the purpose of the legislator in the drafting of that section, to have it apply to such a situation as exists under the will in question. If so, in my view, the legislator has not succeeded and it is not the duty of this Court to legislate. The executors are entitled to the benefit of the exemption and are not caught by the \"minus\" provision at the end of the subsection. I am, therefore, of the opinion that the order asked for by the respondents is the order which should be made by this Court.\nI would dismiss the appellant's appeal with costs but would set aside the assessment made by the Minister with a direction that the Minister should re-assess on the basis that the aggregate taxable value of the estate is $2,920,-607.57, i.e., at an amount obtained by deducting from the aggregate net value of the estate $5,242,455.21, only the aggregate net value of the gift to the charity of $2,261,-847.64 and the basic survivor's exemption allowed by s. 7(1) (a) of the Estate Tax Act.\nAppeal allowed with costs, SPENCE J. dissenting in part.\nSolicitor for the appellant: E.

The oil company was given the right to renew its lease or purchase the property under certain conditions. In October 1960, the appellant, a physician, was granted by company D a concurrent lease on the service station property. This lease was for a term of 200 years at an annual rental of $3,100 and contained an option exercisable by the appellant to purchase the property for $19,500 at the expiration of the 200-year period. The appellant deposited $10,000 with company D as a security for the performance of his covenants. The appellant authorized company D to collect the $3,900 rent from the oil company, deduct the $3,100 rent payable by the appellant and remit the $800 balance to him.\nIn his income tax return for 1960, the appellant included in his income from investments the amount representing the rental for 3 months, and, relying on s. 18 of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148 (repealed in 1963), contended that by his \"contract or arrangement\" he was deemed to have acquired the property at a capital cost of $639,516. This amount was made up of the rent of $3,100 for 200 years plus the option price of $19,500, minus the value of the land. This would entitle him to a deduction of capital cost allowance of $30,425.80 from his other income for that year. The Minister disallowed the deduction of capital cost and allowed a deduction for the rent paid in the year. The Exchequer Court ruled that the capital cost at which the appellant was deemed to have acquired the property was $19,500. The taxpayer appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe transaction embodied in the lease to the appellant was not one to which s. 18 of the Income Tax Act applied. The applicability of that section depends on the existence of a valid option pursuant to which, on the satisfaction of a condition, the demised property will vest in the lessee. The clause purporting to give the appellant an option to purchase the property at the end of 200 years offended the rule against perpetuities and was void.\nOn this view of the matter, the Exchequer Court was right in refusing to interfere with the allowance of $775.02 as rental expense.\nOn the assumption that s. 18 of the Act applied, the Exchequer Court was right in ruling that the \"price fixed by the contract or arrangement\" at which the appellant should \"be deemed to have acquired the property\" was $19,500.\nFurthermore, on the assumption that s. 18 of the Act applied and that on its true construction, the appellant was prima facie entitled to make the deduction of the capital cost allowance claimed by him, such a deduction would be in respect of an expense incurred in respect of a transaction that, if allowed, would artificially reduce the appellant's income, and, consequently, would be forbidden by the terms of s. 137(1) of the Act.\nRevenu\u2014Imp\u00f4t sur le revenu\u2014Co\u00fbt en capital \u00e0 titre d'allocation\u2014Convention de bail avec option\u2014Option d'acheter une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 pour un prix d\u00e9termin\u00e9 apr\u00e8s 200 ans\u2014R\u00e8gle contre la perp\u00e9tuit\u00e9\u2014\u00ab Prix fix\u00e9 par le contrat ou arrangement \u00bb\u2014R\u00e9duction de fa\u00e7on factice du revenu\u2014Loi de l'Imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, S.R.C. 1952, c. 148, arts. 11(1)(a), 18, 137(1).\nDurant le mois d'avril 1960, une station-service, r\u00e9cemment achet\u00e9e par la compagnie D pour une somme de $31,000, fut lou\u00e9e \u00e0 une compagnie d'huile pour une p\u00e9riode de 25 ans \u00e0 un loyer annuel de $3,900. La compagnie d'huile avait le droit de renouveler son bail ou d'acheter la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 sous certaines conditions. En octobre 1960, la compagnie D a conc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 l'appelant, un m\u00e9decin, un bail sujet \u00e0 la servitude du premier bail sur la m\u00eame propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Ce bail \u00e9tait pour un terme de 200 ans \u00e0 un loyer annuel de $3,100 et contenait une option en faveur de l'appelant d'acheter la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 pour $19,500 \u00e0 l'expiration de la p\u00e9riode de 200 ans. L'appelant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une somme de $10,000 entre les mains de la compagnie D comme garantie de l'ex\u00e9cution de sa convention. La compagnie D fut autoris\u00e9e par l'appelant \u00e0 percevoir le loyer de $3,900 de la compagnie d'huile, \u00e0 d\u00e9duire le $3,100 de loyer payable par l'appelant et \u00e0 lui remettre la balance de $800.\nDans son rapport d'imp\u00f4t sur le revenu pour l'ann\u00e9e 1960, l'appelant a inclus le montant repr\u00e9sentant le loyer de 3 mois dans son revenu de placements, et, se basant sur l'art. 18 de la Loi de l'Imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, S.R.C. 1952, c. 148 (abrog\u00e9 en 1963), a pr\u00e9tendu qu'en vertu de son \u00ab contrat ou arrangement \u00bb il \u00e9tait r\u00e9put\u00e9 avoir acquis la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 un co\u00fbt en capital de $639,516. Ce montant \u00e9tait form\u00e9 du loyer de $3,100 pour 200 ans en plus du prix de l'option de $19,500, et moins le montant de la valeur du terrain. Ceci lui accorderait une d\u00e9duction du co\u00fbt en capital \u00e0 titre d'allocation de $30,425.80 de ses autres revenus pour l'ann\u00e9e en question. Le Ministre a rejet\u00e9 la d\u00e9duction du co\u00fbt en capital et a permis la d\u00e9duction pour le loyer pay\u00e9 durant l'ann\u00e9e. La Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier a jug\u00e9 que l'appelant \u00e9tait r\u00e9put\u00e9 avoir acquis la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 un co\u00fbt en capital de $19,500.

Robinette, Q.C., for the appellant.\nD. S. Maxwell, Q.C., and D. G. H. Bowman, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment[3] of Thurlow J. dismissing an appeal from a decision of the Tax Appeal Board which dismissed the appellant's appeal from an assessment whereby income tax in the sum of $18,690.42 was levied in respect of his income for the 1960 taxation year.\nThe appellant practises medicine in the City of Toronto specializing in obstetrics and gynaecology. He has a substantial income from his practice and some income from investments.\nIn his income tax return for the year 1960 the appellant included in his income from investments $975 being rental for three months from a service station on Lorne Park Road in the Township of Toronto hereinafter sometimes referred to as \"the service station\", and claimed in respect of the same property a deduction by way of depreciation or capital cost allowance of $30,425.80. The Minister disallowed this claim in toto and allowed instead a rental expense of $775.02. This appeal relates solely to these two items.\nBy deed dated March 31, 1960, one Charles Gotts conveyed the service station to Douglas Leaseholds Limited. The property conveyed has a frontage of 150 feet on the south side of Lorne Park Road by a depth of 100 feet. The total consideration was $31,000, one half of which was paid in cash and the other secured by mortgage.\nBy an indenture dated April 4, 1960, Douglas Leaseholds Limited leased the service station to BP Canada Limited for the term of twenty-five years to be computed from the first day of the month following the installation by the lessor of two 2,000 gallon tanks which together with certain other equipment were to be supplied by the lessee and installed by the lessor. The rent was $3,900 a year payable $325 on the first of each month. The lessee covenanted to pay taxes and to make repairs. This lease gives the lessee a right of preemption in the event of the lessor receiving an offer to purchase the demised premises during the term which it is willing to accept. It also contains a provision that if during the term the lessor receives an offer to lease the demised premises upon the termination of the lease, which it is willing to accept, it will first offer to lease the premises to the lessee on the terms contained in the offer except that the rent payable by the lessee shall be 90 per cent of the rent set out in the offer.\nBetween March 31, 1960, and October 1, 1960, Douglas Leaseholds Limited expended about $8,500 on improvements to the property. Mr. Douglas the president of Douglas Leaseholds Limited stated that the property was carried in the company's books at $39,000, apportioned $30,000 to the building and $9,000 to the land.\nBy indenture dated October 1, 1960, Douglas Leaseholds Limited demised the service station to the appellant for a term of two hundred years from the date of the lease at an annual rental of $3,100.08 payable $258.34 on the first day of each month commencing with October, 1960. The lessee covenants to pay taxes and to make repairs. This lease contains the following provisions:\nPROVIDED always and it is expressly agreed between the Lessor and Lessee that this lease is subject in all respects to a lease dated the 4th day of April, 1960, entered into between Douglas Leaseholds Limited and BP Canada Limited. The Lessee convenants and agrees to deposit with the Lessor the sum of $10,000.00 as security for the performance of all his covenants contained in the within lease. The Lessor agrees that if the Lessee observes and performs all the covenants herein contained it will return to the Lessee the said sum of $10,000.00 at the expiration of the term hereby demised.\nAt the expiration of the term hereby demised, and provided the Lessee is not in default hereunder, said Lessee shall have the option of purchasing the demised premises from the Lessor at the price of Nineteen Thousand Five Hundred ($19,500.00) Dollars. The Lessee may exercise the said option by giving to the Lessor three (3) months' notice in writing that he intends to purchase the demised premises and upon the exercise of the said option the sale shall be completed within a thirty (30) day period after the option has been exercised.\nIn the event that the demised premises are expropriated by any municipal or governmental authority or in the event the Tenant Oil Company should exercise any option contained in its lease hereinbefore referred to which would result in the Tenant Oil Company becoming the owner of the demised premises, then the Lessor agrees that it will lease to the Lessee a similar gasoline service station, such lease to comply with the following requirements, that is to say:\nThe lease shall be in the same form as the within lease, save for the following:\ni. The Term of the lease shall be for the unexpired portion of the within lease.\nii. The rental payable under the new lease shall be $800.00 per annum less than the annual rental payable by the Oil Company leasing the premises from Douglas Leaseholds Limited.\niii. The lessee shall have the option of purchasing the premises demised under the new lease at a purchase price equal to five times the annual rental provided for in the lease between Douglas Leaseholds Limited and the Tenant Oil Company, the said option to be subject to the same conditions as the option hereinbefore set out.\nBy a document dated October 1, 1960, the appellant authorized Douglas Leaseholds Limited as his agent to collect the rent falling due from BP Canada Limited under the lease of April 4,1960.\nThe appellant's claim to the capital cost allowance of $30,425.80 is based on s. 11(1) (a) of the Income Tax Act, the regulations made thereunder and section 18 of the Income Tax Act.\nSection 11(1) (a) reads as follows:\n11(1) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a), (b) and (h) of subsection (1) of section 12, the following amounts may be deducted in computing the income of a taxpayer for a taxation year:\n(a) such part of the capital cost to the taxpayer of property, or such amount in respect of the capital cost to the taxpayer of property, if any, as is allowed by regulation;\nIt is common ground that if the appellant's claim is well founded the capital cost allowance in respect of the building on the demised premises is fixed by regulation at five per cent of the undepreciated capital cost thereof to him as of the end of the taxation year.\nSection 18 has since been repealed but as in force during the taxation year with which we are concerned sub-section (1) thereof read as follows:\n18. (1) A lease-option agreement, a hire-purchase agreement or other contract or arrangement for the leasing or hiring of property, except immovable property used in carrying on the business of farming, by which it is agreed that the property may, on the satisfaction of a condition, vest in the lessee or other person to whom the property is leased or hired (hereinafter in this section referred to as the 'lessee') or in a person with whom the lessee does not deal at arm's length shall, for the purpose of computing the income of the lessee, be deemed to be an agreement for the sale of the property to him and rent or other consideration paid or given thereunder shall be deemed to be on account of the price of the property and not for its use; and the lessee shall, for the purpose of a deduction under paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of section 11 and for the purpose of section 20, be deemed to have acquired the property,\n(a)in any case where, at the time the contract or arrangement was entered into, the lessee and the person in whom the property was vested at that time (hereinafter referred to as the 'lessor') were persons not dealing at arm's length, at a capital cost equal to the capital cost thereof to the lessor, and\n(b) in any other case, at a capital cost equal to the price fixed by the contract or arrangement minus the aggregate of all amounts paid by the lessee\n(i) in the case of a contract or arrangement relating to movable property, before the 1949 taxation year, and\n(ii) in the case of any other contract or arrangement, before the 1950 taxation year,\nunder the contract or arrangement on account of the rent or other consideration.\nThe appellant submits that the lease from Douglas Leaseholds Limited to himself is \"a lease-option agreement or other contract or arrangement for the leasing of property by which it is agreed that the property may, on the satisfaction of a condition, vest in the lessee\", that pursu-ant to s. 18(1) it is, for the purpose of computing his income, to be deemed an agreement for the sale of the demised premises to him, that the rent paid shall be deemed to be on account of the price of the property and not for its use and that he must, pursuant to s. 18(1) (b) be deemed to have acquired the property at a capital cost equal to the price fixed by the contract or arrangement, that is to say, by the lease. It will be observed that the deductions contemplated by sub-clauses (i) and (ii) of clause (b) of s. 18(1) have no application on the facts in the case at bar. The case has been dealt with throughout on the assumption that the appellant and Douglas Leaseholds Limited were dealing at arm's length.\nThe condition on the satisfaction of which the demised premises may vest in the lessee is his performance of all the lessee's covenants contained in the lease throughout the term of 200 years, the giving of the necessary notice to exercise the option and the payment of the price of $19,500.\nThe appellant submits that as the rent paid \"shall be deemed to be on account of the price of the property and not for its use\" the price should for the purpose of comput-ing his income be deemed to be $608,516, this amount being arrived at as follows:\nAnnual rental of $3100.08 for 200 years\n$620,016.00\nOption price to purchase property\n19,500.00\n$639,516.00\nLess land at fair market value as of October,\n31,000.00\n$608,516.00\nFive per cent of this amount is $30,425.80 which is the capital cost allowance claimed by the appellant.\nThe above figures are taken from the appellant's income tax return. It would seem from the evidence that the fair market value of the land as of October, 1960, was $9,000 rather than $31,000 but the question of importance is whether the appellant's method of calculating the capital cost at which he is deemed to have acquired the demised property is correct.\nCounsel for the respondent submitted that s. 18 has no application to the appellant's lease on the following grounds:\n(a) that it was not established that the price of $19,500 was less than 60 per cent of the fair market value of the demised property at the time the lease was entered into and consequently the application of s. 18 was excluded by sub-section (4) ;\n(b) the transaction evidenced by the lease was not really a lease at all and the appellant at the relevant time was not a lessee of the property but merely the holder of an interesse termini; (c) that the option contained in the lease is void as it offends the rule against perpetuities.\nIf, contrary to these submissions, it should be held that s. 18 did apply to the transaction counsel for the respondent argued that the appellant was not entitled to the allowance of $775.02 for rental expense but at most to a capital cost allowance of $525 (being 5 per cent of $10,500, the price fixed by the lease, $19,500, less the value of the land, $9,000) on the following grounds:\n(d)that the transaction was not entered into for the purpose of gaining income but solely, or in the alternative primarily, for the purpose of reducing the appellant's income tax and thus fell within the prohibition or exception provided by Regulation 1102(1)(c);\n(e) that the deduction claimed represented an expense made or incurred in respect of a transaction which, if allowed, would unduly and artificially reduce the appellant's income and its deduction was therefore prohibited by s. 137(1) of the Act;\n(f) (i) that on the correct interpretation of s. 18, as applied to the transaction, the deduction must be based on a capital cost of $19,500 for the property since this is the price fixed for it by the contract, and\n(ii) that in the event of this contention being upheld the re-assessment should be referred back to the Minister to allow the proper deduction on this basis and to disallow the rental expense item.\nThurlow J. gave effect to the first contention of the respondent set out in ground (f) and so found it unneces-sary to deal with grounds (a), (b), (c), (d) or (e).\nFor reasons that will appear, I do not think that the transaction embodied in the lease to the appellant is one to which s. 18 applies. On the assumption that the section does apply I would agree with the view of Thurlow J. that on the true construction of s. 18 as applied to the lease in question the \"price fixed by the contract or arrangement\" being the capital cost at which under s. 18(1) (b) the appellant should \"be deemed to have acquired the proper\u2014ty\" is $19,500 and not the figure contended for by the appellant. I am in substantial agreement with the reasons of Thurlow J. for reaching this conclusion and wish to add only a few words on this point. If the submission of the appellant were given effect it would bring about the result that for the purpose of calculating his income tax he would be deemed to have acquired a property in 1960 at a capital cost of $639,516 although on the evidence the highest value which could be attributed to that property was $39,500. The power of Parliament to so enact is not doubted, but to bring about so extraordinary a result it would be necessary to use explicit words which admitted of no other interpretation. I have already indicated my agreement with the conclusion of Thurlow J. that far from requiring such an interpretation the words of the statute properly construed necessitate its rejection.\nThis would be sufficient to dispose of the appeal if it were not for the contention pressed by counsel for the respondent that Thurlow J. should have held that the rental allowance of $775.02 ought not to have been made, that a capital cost allowance of $525 should have been made instead and that the re-assessment should have been referred back to the Minister accordingly. On this point I agree with the conclusion of Thurlow J. but prefer to base my decision on a different ground.\nIn my view, the position taken by counsel for the respondent in ground (c) set out above is well taken. The clause in the lease giving the option to purchase has been quoted above. It creates an equitable interest in the land demised which would vest on the giving of the required notice and payment of the purchase money. This interest will not necessarily vest within the period prescribed by law for the creation of future estates and interests, indeed it cannot vest until long after the expiry of that period which in the case at bar, since no life is specified, is 21 years. The right to exercise the option does not arise until the expiration of 200 years from the date of the lease. The grant of the option therefore offends the rule and is void. The effect of this is that the lease takes effect as if the void limitation created by the option were omitted. The applicability of s. 18(1) depends on the existence of a valid option pursuant to which, on the satisfaction of a condition, the demised property will vest in the lessee. The purported option being void the section has no application.\nThat an option to purchase land gives rise to a contingent equitable interest in the land, the contingency being the election to exercise the option and payment of the price, is settled by the judgment of Judson J., speaking for the majority of the Court in Frobisher Ltd. v. Canadian Pipe-Lines and Petroleums Ltd.[4]. The accepted rule in regard to such an option contained in a lease is succinctly and accurately stated in Gray, The Rule Against Perpetuities, 4th ed., p. 234, s. 230.3, as follows:\nAn option to a tenant for years to purchase the fee, exercisable at a remote time, is bad as violating the Rule against Perpetuities.\nFor the appellant, however, it is argued that even if the clause giving the option in so far as it creates a limitation of land is bad for perpetuity it also evidences a personal contract between Douglas Leaseholds Limited and the appellant which is unaffected by the rule against perpetuities and can be enforced by the lessee or his personal representatives against the lessor so long as it has not disposed of the property. The argument proceeds that in the year 2160, Douglas Leaseholds Limited may still own the property in question and if so Dr. Harris' descendants or assigns could on duly exercising the option obtain a decree of specific performance against the lessor and that this possibility brings the case within s. 18(1), stress being laid on the use of the word \"may\" in the sub-section. It is argued that the suggested circumstances may occur and therefore the property may vest in the lessee and that this is sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the sub-section.\nThis argument is based chiefly on the following cases: South Eastern Railway Co. v. Associated Portland Cement Manufacturers Ltd.[5], a decision of the Court of Appeal in England, affirming, on different grounds, a judgment of Swinfen Eady J.; Hutton v. Watling[6], a decision of Jenkins J., as he then was, and Kennedy v. Beaucage Mines Limited[7], a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario.\nThe decision in the first of these cases, usually referred to as the Cement Company's case has been the subject of much adverse criticism; See Williams on Vendor and Purchaser, 4th ed., vol. 1, p. 424, note (i); Gray op. cit. page 366 et seq, ss. 330.2 and 330.3; Articles by Mr. T. Cyprian Williams in 42 Sol. J. 628 and 650 and in 54 Sol. J. 471 and 501; and articles by Mr. Charles Sweet in 27 L.Q.R. 150 and 32 L.Q.R. 70.\nThe decision in Hutton v. Wating, which followed and was founded on that in the Cement Company's case, has been criticized by Dr. Walford in an article \"Options to Purchase and Perpetuities\" (1948) Conv. (N.S.) 258.\nThese cases are not binding upon us but the Cement Company's case was one of those referred to in a passage in Halsbury's Laws of England, 2nd ed., vol. 25 at p. 109, which has been referred to with approval in two recent judgments of this Court. The passage is as follows:\nA contract relating to a right of or equitable interest in property in futuro may be intended to create a limitation of land only, in which case, if the limitation is to take effect beyond the perpetuity period, the contract is wholly void and unenforceable; or the contract may, upon its true construction, be a personal contract only, in which case the rule does not apply to it; or it may, upon its true construction, be, as regards the original covenantor, both a personal contract and a contract attempting to create a remote limitation, in which case the limitation will be bad for perpetuity, but the personal contract will be enforceable, if the case otherwise admits, against the promisor by specific performance or by damages, or against his personal representatives in damages only. In all cases it is a question of construction whether the contract is intended to create a limitation of property only, or a personal obligation only, or both.\nThe Cement Company's case is quoted in the footnote as authority for the words in the passage which I have italicized. It may be observed in passing that in the 3rd Edition of Halsbury, the corresponding passage is found in volume 29, page 297, and is in the same words except that for the concluding words of the penultimate sentence \"or against his personal representative in damages only\" there have been substituted the words \"or against his personal representative in damages or possibly by specific performance\".\nThe cases in this Court referred to above in which this passage was quoted are the Frobisher case, supra, at page 147 and Prudential Trust Company v. Forseth[8] .In my opinion neither of these cases binds us to accepting the passage quoted in its entirety or to approving the decision in the Cement Company's case. In the Frobisher case the passage was quoted in the course of rejecting an argument sought to be based upon a supposed analogy with some of the cases upon which it was founded. In Forseth, Martland J. delivering the unanimous judgment of the Court said at page 226: \"The law regarding the subject of contracts relating to rights in the future has been well summarized in Halsbury's Laws of England, 2nd ed., vol. 25, at p. 109, as follows\"; and then quoted the passage; but, immediately before this he had said:\nFinally it was contended that, in any event, the provision of the assignment regarding the option to lease was void as offending against the Rule against Perpetuities.\nIn view of the fact that there are eight producing oil wells on this property, it would seem to me that this issue is really academic, since the option can only be exercised after the termination of the Imperial Oil Limited lease. We are being asked, therefore, to determine questions of law which are unlikely to arise and which, if they arise at all, can only arise in the remote future.\nIt is sufficient to say that at this stage I would not be prepared to hold that the option is void.\nand following the quotation he continued:\nI am not prepared to say that the assignment did not constitute a personal contract by Forseth, especially when it is borne in mind that the agreement contemplates a future petroleum and natural gas lease to be granted, not by Forseth only, but by both Forseth and Prudential as co-owners. The real effect of his covenant was to give assent to a leasing of his share of the petroleum and natural gas rights along with the share of his co-owner Prudential.\nThis judgment appears to me to have left open the question whether the clause regarding the granting of an option was void; it was not necessary to decide it in order to dispose of the appeal and it appeared unlikely that it would ever require decision.\nIn Hutton v. Watling, supra, at pp. 35 and 36, Jenkins J., as he then was, said:\nThe Associated Portland Cement Manufacturers case therefore, appears to me to provide clear authority, which is, of course, binding on me, to the effect that an option to purchase land without limit as regards time is specifically enforceable as a matter of personal contract against the original grantor of the option, and that the rule against perpetuities has no relevance to such a case, as distinct from a case in which such an option is sought to be enforced against some successor in title of the original grantor, not by virtue of any contractual obligation on the part of the successor in title, but by virtue of the equitable interest in the land conferred on the grantee by the option agreement.\nThe judgment of Jenkins J. was affirmed in the Court of Appeal but, in that Court, the question of the effect of the Rule against Perpetuities was neither argued nor considered.\nIn my respectful opinion, the passage last quoted above, whether or not it finds support in what was said in the judgments in the Cement Company's case, is not a correct statement of the law. The Rule against Perpetuities is founded on grounds of public policy and by it a contract by the owner of property to convey the property on such terms that it will not vest until the happening of a contingent event beyond the period permitted by the rule is not allowed to be made.\nIn my view the law is accurately stated in the following passage in the judgment of Jessel M.R. in London and South Western Railway Co. v. Gomm[9] :\nIt appears to me therefore that this covenant plainly gives the company an interest in the land, and as regards remoteness there is no distinction that I know of (unless the case falls within one of the recognised exceptions, such as charities) between one kind of equitable interest and another kind of equitable interest. In all cases they must take effect as against the owners of the land within a prescribed period.\nIt was suggested that the rule has no application to any case of contract, but in my opinion the mode in which the interest is created is immaterial. Whether it is by devise or voluntary gift or contract can make no difference. The question is, what is the nature of the interest intended to be created? I do not know that I can do better than read the two passages cited in argument from Mr. Lewis's well-known book on Perpetuities at page 164. He cites with approbation this passage from Mr. Sanders' Essay on Uses and Trusts: 'A perpetuity may be defined to be a future limitation, restraining the owner of the estate from aliening the fee simple of the property discharged of such future use or estate before the event is determined or the period is arrived when such future use or estate is to arise. If that event or period be within the bounds prescribed by law it is not a perpetuity'. Then Mr. Lewis adds these words: 'In other words, a perpetuity is a future limitation whether executory or by way of remainder and of either real or personal property, which is not to vest until after the expiration of, or will not necessarily vest within, the period fixed and prescribed by law for the creation of future estates and interests; and which is not destructible by the persons for the time being entitled to the property subject to the future limitation. except with the concurrence of the individual interested under that limitation'.\nNow is there any substantial distinction between a contract for purchase, or an option for purchase, and a conditional limitation? Is there any difference in substance between the case of a limitation to A. in fee, with a proviso that whenever a notice in writing is sent and One Hundred Pounds paid by B. or his heirs to A. or his heirs the estate shall vest in B. and his heirs, and a contract that whenever such notice is given and such payment made by B. or his heirs to A. or his heirs, A. shall convey to B. and his heirs? It seems to me that in a Court of Equity it is impossible to suggest that there is any real distinction between these two cases. There is in each case the same fetter on the estate and on the owners of the estate for all time, and it seems to me to be plain that the rules as to remoteness apply to one case as much as to the other.\nIt is true, of course, that in Gomm's case the Railway Company was seeking to enforce the option not against Powell who had granted it but against Gomm to whom the subject matter of the option had been conveyed and who had taken with full notice of the option; but, properly understood, there is not a word in the judgment of Jessel M.R. or the other judgments delivered in the Court of Appeal to support the suggestion that the option could have been enforced against Powell had he still retained the property.\nIn the Cement Company's case, by an accommodation works agreement of May 31, 1847, the plaintiff Railway Company who were purchasing a strip of land for their line, agreed that the landowner, his heirs, appointees or assigns might at any time thereafter make a tunnel thereunder to join the lands severed thereby. The purpose of the tunnel was to enable the landowner to excavate chalk from the land on the south side of the railway after that on the north side had been worked out. On December 31, 1847, the landowner conveyed the strip to the Railway Company by deed poll, reserving to himself, his heirs, appointees and assigns the privilege of making a tunnel. The landowner died in 1880. The tunnel was not required by the lessees of the land to whom the privilege of making it had been duly assigned, until some time after the year 1900 when they proposed to construct it. The Railway Company objected and brought an action to restrain the making of the tunnel. The action was dismissed by Swinfen Eady J. and his judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. Other points were raised and dealt with but we are concerned only with those parts of the judgments which deal with the Railway Company's submission, that the provision as to the tunnel was void for perpetuity. Swinfen Eady J. rejected this argument on the ground that what was reserved to the landowner was not a right to arise at some future time but an immediate right which arose directly the conveyance was executed.\nIn the Court of Appeal the opinion was expressed that the right to construct the tunnel could be enforced against the Railway Company which was still the owner of the strip of land. At page 29 of the report, Cozen-Hardy M.R. after stating the facts in Gomm's case said that as he read that case it was a clear and distinct authority for the view that the contract there under consideration could have been enforced against Powell.\nHe continued at pp. 29 and 30:\nKay J. from whom the appeal was brought, says 'A contract to buy or sell land and covenants restricting the use of land, though unlimited, are not void for perpetuity.' That means as between the contracting parties, and Sir George Jessel expressly draws the distinction in these words: 'If it is a bare or mere personal contract it is of course not obnoxious to the rule, but in that case it is impossible to see how the present appellant can be bound. He did not enter into the contract, but is only a purchaser from Powell, who did. If it is a mere personal contract it cannot be enforced against the assignee. Therefore the company must admit that it somehow binds the land.' And Lindley L.J. says: \"How is Gomm to be held bound by this covenant? He did not enter into it, he is not bound at law.' So far from that being an authority that Powell would not have been bound by the covenant, and that the London and South Western Railway Company could not have enforced the covenant against Powell, I think the observations of all the members of the Court plainly indicate that in that case there would have been a perfectly enforceable covenant by Powell at the instance of the London and South Western Railway Company, and the whole doctrine of the rule against perpetuities would have had absolutely nothing to do with it. So that, if Mr. Calcraft were now alive, I think there could be no answer to an action by him against his living covenantor claiming to enforce the rights under the covenant in the agreement of 1847.\nWith respect this passage appears to me to indicate a misunderstanding of the judgment in Gomm. Jessel M.R. was distinguishing between contracts which are merely personal and contracts which create an interest in land, the former are not affected by the rule against perpetuities but the latter if the interest created will not necessarily vest within the permitted period are void just as much against the original covenantor as against his assigns.\nFarwell L.J. at page 33 of the report of the Cement Company's case said:\nIt is settled beyond argument that an agreement merely personal not creating any interest in land is not within the rule against perpetuities.\nHe then referred to Witham v. Vane, a decision of the House of Lords, (1883) Challins on Real Property, 2nd Ed. App. V, page 401, in which the covenant in question did not create any interest in land, and continued:\nBut the fact that there is some connection with or reference to land does not make a personal contract by A. less a personal contract binding on him, with all the remedies arising thereout, unless the Court can by construction turn it from a personal contract into a limitation of land, and a limitation of land only. As regards the original covenantor it may be both; he may have attempted both to limit the estate, which may be bad for perpetuity, and he may have entered into a personal covenant which is binding on him because the rule against perpetuities has no application to such a covenant.\nIt appears that Farwell L.J., in the passage quoted, was considering two types of contract one \"merely personal\" and the other \"creating an interest in land\". The meaning of the phrase \"an agreement merely personal\" as he used it is simply an agreement which does not create an interest in land. So understood the only objection to accepting what he has said appears to me to be the difficulty of suggesting a single contract which could be at once \"merely personal\" and one creating an interest in land.\nBe that as it may, I am satisfied that as a matter of construction the clause granting the option to the appellant which we are considering in the case at bar is one agreeing to create a contingent future interest in the land demised and nothing else and that it is void as infringing the rule against perpetuities. If the agreement to create the contingent future interest is taken out of the clause there is no agreement left to be described as a personal contract.\nIt is not necessary to express an opinion as to whether the actual result reached in the Cement Company's case was correct. It may well be supported on the ground on which Swinfen Eady J. proceeded, but, with respect, it does appear to me that Hutton v. Watling, supra, and Kennedy v. Beaucage Mines Limited, supra, which followed it, were wrongly decided and ought not to be followed.\nIn the case of Auld v. Scales[10], the question was raised whether an option contained in a lease was void as offending the rule against perpetuities. The Court was unanimous in holding that the grant of the option there under consideration did not offend the rule because the future interest which it created was, within the period permitted by the rule, destructible by the lessor without the concurrence of the lessee, but it appears to me to be implicit in all the reasons delivered that if this had not been so and the option had consequently offended the rule it would have been void and unenforceable although the action was between the original parties to the lease.\nFor these reasons I am of opinion that the clause in the lease to the appellant purporting to give him the option to purchase the demised premises at the expiration of the term of 200 years offends the rule against perpetuities and is void. On this view of the matter Thurlow J. was right in refusing to interfere with the allowance of $775.02 as rental expense.\nWhile, in view of the conclusions at which I have arrived on the points dealt with above, it is not necessary to express an opinion upon the other grounds on which counsel for the respondent opposed the appeal, I propose to state briefly my opinion on the position taken in ground (e) set out above which was fully argued.\nSection 137(1) of the Income Tax Act reads as follows:\n137. (1) In computing income for the purposes of this Act, no deduction may be made in respect of a disbursement or expense made or incurred in respect of a transaction or operation that, if allowed, would unduly or artificially reduce the income.\nIf, contrary to the views I have expressed, we had accepted the appellant's submission that the transaction embodied in the lease was one to which s. 18 applied and that on the true construction of the lease and the terms of that section the appellant was prima facie entitled to make the deduction of the capital cost allowance of $30,425.80 claimed by him, I would have had no hesitation in holding that it was a deduction in respect of an expense incurred in respect of a transaction that if allowed would artificially reduce the income of the appellant and that consequently its allowance was forbidden by the terms of s. 137(1). The words in the sub-section \"a disbursement or expense made or incurred\" are, in my opinion, apt to include a claim for depreciation or for capital cost allowance, and if the lease were construed as above suggested the arrangement embodied in it would furnish an example of the very sort of \"transaction or operation\" at which s. 137(1) is aimed.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: John J.

The trial judgment declared that the sum of $31,999.01 received by the company and deposited to the credit of its account in the defendant bank, or so much thereof as the plaintiff and all others on whose behalf it sues should be found entitled to, constituted a trust fund under s. 3 of The Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act, directed a reference and judgment against the bank for the amount found due on the reference with interest and costs. The judgment provided that the declaration as to the trust fund should be binding on the company but that otherwise the action as against it should be dismissed. On appeal, the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and dismissed the action.\nHeld (Judson J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed, the judgment of the Court of Appeal set aside and the trial judgment restored.\nPer Cartwright, Martland, Hall and Spence JJ.: The appeal succeeded on two grounds. Firstly, it having been established that the $31,999.01 came into the possession of the company impressed with the trust created by subs. (1) of s. 3 of The Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act and that there were unpaid subcontractors who were prima facie entitled to the trust fund, the onus of proving the facts, if they existed, which would bring the case within the exception created by subs. (3) lay upon the bank and that onus was not satisfied. Secondly, even if the state of the accounts at the date when the $31,999.01 was received by the company was such that it was entitled under subs. (3) to retain that sum for its own use, its decision whether or not to do so involved the exercise of a discretion vested in it as trustee and the only inference that could reasonably be drawn from the evidence was that it decided to exercise that discretion in favour of the plaintiff and those on whose behalf it sued and not in its own favour.\nPer Judson J., dissenting: As held by the Court of Appeal, s. 3(3) did not mean retention as part of the trust fund but enabled the contractor, where the conditions of the subsection were met, to use the money for the discharge of his own obligations. The Court of Appeal was right in finding on a review of the facts of the case that subs. (3) applied, that there was no breach of trust in the deposit of this cheque into an overdrawn account and that the bank was entitled to apply it on the overdraft.\n[Passage in Fonthill Lumber Ltd. v.

Kellock, Q.C., and J.W Garrow, for the defendants, respondents.\nThe judgment of Cartwright, Martland, Hall and Spence J.J. was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1 allowing an appeal from a judgment of Gale J., as he then was, and dismissing the action with costs payable to the respondent the Canadian Bank of Commerce. The judgment of Gale J. declared that a sum of $31,999.01 received by the defendant Gels General Contractors Limited and deposited to the credit of its account in the defendant bank, or so much thereof as the plaintiff and all others on whose behalf it sues should be found entitled to, constituted a trust fund under s. 3 of The Mechanics Lien Act, directed a reference and judgment against the bank for the amount found due on the reference with interest and costs. The judgment provided that the declaration as to the trust fund should be binding on the defendant Gels General Contractors Limited but that otherwise the action as against it should be dismissed without costs.\nThe defendant Gels General Contractors Limited, hereinafter sometimes referred to as \u201cGels\u201d, entered into a contract with the Board of Education for the City of Toronto for the construction of a school. The contract in question is dated November 9, 1959. The contract price was approximately $833,000. Gels entered into subcontracts with various subcontractors for part of the work and material including a subcontract with the plaintiff company covering the plumbing and heating. Work on the main contract commenced about December 1, 1959. As the job progressed part of the work was done by Gels through its own employees and part by the subcontractors through their employees. Some of the materials were obtained by Gels from suppliers with whom it dealt and some were supplied by the subcontractors. Gels paid the wages of its employees when the wages were earned and paid its suppliers as the materials were invoiced without waiting for any progress certificate from the architects. About once a month the subcontractors billed Gels for the value of the work estimated by them to have been done to date and Gels in turn prepared and submitted to the Board through the architects a requisition for payment on account of the contract price, the amount of the payment being calculated by reference to the total value of the work done and material supplied to date and to the total contract price and giving credit for any payments previously made on account. The total value of the work done to the date of the requisition included work done and material supplied by Gels through its employees and suppliers. The requisition was checked by the architects and the amount as approved by them, less the statutory holdback of 15 per cent, was paid by the Board to Gels and deposited by Gels in its bank account with the defendant bank. Gels would then issue cheques to the subcontractors for amounts owing by it to them. During the intervals between the submitting of the requisition and the receipt of payment from the Board work on the job continued so that by the time the subcontractors received payment there was an additional amount owing to them by Gels and an additional amount owing to Gels by the Board.\nThe sum of $31,999.01 in question in this action was paid by the Board on October 27 pursuant to a progress certificate issued by the architects to Gels dated October 13, 1960, following a requisition by Gels dated September 30, 1960. The amount actually approved by the architects was $31,899.01 but by error the cheque was issued for the larger amount. Gels deposited the cheque in its account with the respondent Bank on October 27.\nOn October 28 Gels issued cheques to the subcontractors including one to the plaintiff for $14,450 but these cheques were dishonoured because the bank applied the whole of the $31,999.01 on an overdraft in the Gels account thereby reducing the overdraft to $6,419.70.\nAt the date of entering into the contract with the Board Gels had its bank account in the Avenue Road and Dunblaine Branch of the respondent bank in the City of Toronto and it continued to do all its banking there during all relevant times. From November, 1959, to the end of the year 1960, Gels was engaged chiefly on its contract with the Board but it was also engaged on some other building projects. All its receipts from whatever source were deposited in its bank account with the respondent bank and all disbursements were made by cheques drawn on that account including disbursements unconnected with the contract with the Board.\nAt the time of commencing work on the contract Gels had arranged with the bank for a credit of $45,000. By October, 1960, the bank had decided that it was unwilling to continue to extend credit to Gels and viewed with some alarm the state of its account. To the knowledge of the branch manager of the bank Gels was being pressed for payment by the subcontractors and mechanics\u2019 liens had been filed on July 25 and October 7. In these circumstances the branch manager decided to appropriate the next payment received by Gels from the Board in reduction of Gels\u2019 overdraft and not to extend further credit; he did not so advise Livingstone who was the general manager and virtual owner of Gels.\nOn ample evidence the learned trial judge has found that, at the time it appropriated the $31,999.01 in reduction of the overdraft, the bank, through its branch manager, knew that it was a sum received by Gels on account of the contract price under its contract with the Board and that a number of subcontractors had not been paid for work done and materials supplied on that contract. The contract was finally completed but the plaintiff and other subcontractors have not been paid in full.\nThe learned trial judge found that on the evidence it was reasonably clear that in the month of October, 1960, between the date of the requisition for payment and the receipt of the $31,999.01 Gels had paid out to its own employees and suppliers amounts totalling more than that sum.\nOn these findings of fact, the question to be determined was as to the effect of s. 3 of The Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act which reads as follows:\n3. (1) All sums received by a builder or contractor or a subcontractor on account of the contract price are and constitute a trust fund in the hands of the builder or contractor, or of the subcontractor, as the case may be, for the benefit of the proprietor, builder or contractor, subcontractors, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board, workmen and persons who have supplied material on account of the contract, and the builder or contractor or the subcontractor, as the case may be, is the trustee of all such sums so received by him, and until all workmen and all persons who have supplied material on the contract and all subcontractors are paid for work done or material supplied on the contract and the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board is paid any assessment with respect thereto, may not appropriate or convert any part thereof to his own use or to any use not authorized by the trust.\n(2) Every builder, contractor or subcontractor who appropriates or converts any part of the contract price referred to in subsection (1) to his own use or to any use not authorized by the trust is guilty of an offence and on summary conviction is liable to a fine of not more than $5,000.00 or to imprisonment for a term of not more than two years or both, and every director or officer of a corporation who knowingly assents to or acquiesces in any such offence by the corporation is guilty of such offence in addition to the corporation.\n(3) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, where a builder, contractor or subcontractor has paid in whole or part for any materials supplied on account of the contract, or any workman or subcontractor who has performed any work or services or placed or furnished any material in respect of such contract, the retention by such builder, contractor or subcontractor of any amount so paid by him shall not be deemed an appropriation or conversion thereof to his own use or to any use not authorized by the trust.\nThe reasons of the learned trial judge make it clear that, had he regarded the question as being res integra, he would have construed subs. (3) as modifying the effect of subs. (1) so as to constitute the contractor not only a trustee of all sums received by him on account of the contract price but also a beneficiary under the trust created by the subsection to the extent that he had paid out of his own funds for work done and materials supplied in performance of the contract. The learned judge was however of opinion that he was bound to hold otherwise by the judgment of the Court of Appeal delivered by Schroeder J.A. in Fonthill Lumber Ltd. v. Bank of Montreal[2] and particularly the following passage at p. 470:\nIt was urged that the bank manager might have believed that the contractor had paid out of his own money for the materials supplied on account of the contracts in question or for work performed thereon with the result, that in using the moneys on deposit to pay his indebtedness to the bank he was not to be deemed to be appropriating or converting these moneys by virtue of s. 3(3). Obviously, the fallacy of this argument lies in the fact that he was thereby divesting himself of the money, and s. 3(3) only prevents the retention thereof by the builder from operating as a wrongful appropriation or conversion within the meaning of that section.\nThe Court of Appeal regarded the passage just quoted as obiter dictum and disagreed with it. Roach J.A. who delivered the unanimous judgment of the Court said in part:\nBy virtue of s. 3(1) the sums which are the subject of the trust thereby created are any sums \u2018received by a builder or contractor or a subcontractor on account of the contract price\u2019. When, as in this case, an owner makes an interim payment to a general contractor pursuant to a progress certificate it is made on account of the whole contract price. The certificate on the strength of which the Board paid the $31,999.01 states in terms that Gels \u2018is entitled to a payment of $31,899.01 being tenth: Payment on the contract\u2019.\nWho are the beneficiaries of that trust? It is plain from subs. (1) that they are and were thereby intended to be all those persons who contributed to the totality of the work and material up to the date of payment. Included among them, in the instant case, was Gels which had contributed to that totality through its own workmen and material men. Gels was therefore both a trustee of the $31,999.01 received by it and one of the beneficiaries of that trust. Subsection (1) standing by itself prohibited Gels from appropriating or converting any part of that trust fund to its own use or to any use not authorized by the trust until, among others, all subcontractors had been paid. By reason of that prohibition a subcontractor would have a preferential right to payment out of the trust fund to compensate him not only for any moneys expended by him but also for his earned profit before Gels, as the general contractor, could have recourse to the fund to compensate itself even for moneys expended by it for labour or material that had gone into the building.\nIn 1952 the Legislature amended s. 3 by adding thereto subss. (2) and (3). In my opinion on the plain wording of subs. (3) Gels as the contractor was entitled to retain out of the trust fund sufficient to recoup itself for moneys that it had paid to its employees, workmen, material men or subcontractors. The word \u2018retention\u2019 as used in subsection (3) cannot mean retention as part of the trust fund. The \u2018retention\u2019 thereby authorized is a retention which, were it not for subs. (3), would amount to a prohibited appropriation or conversion by the contractor to his own use and a retention in the trust fund obviously would not amount to such an appropriation or conversion. The contractor is still not put on an equal footing with the subcontractor. The former has only the right to recoup itself out of the trust fund for moneys actually expended out of its own pocket for labour or material or in payments to subcontractors; the latter\u2019s beneficial interest in the trust fund includes not only any amount expended out of its pocket for that purpose but also its earned profit.\nThere is nothing in the whole of s. 3 amounting to a direction as to the manner in which the trust fund created by subs. (1) is to be apportioned among those entitled and in the absence of such a direction it has been held by Rand, J. in Minneapolis-Honeywell Regulator Co. Limited v. Empire Brass Manufacturing Co. Limited [1955] S.C.R. 694 at 697 that the trustee has a discretionary power and his obligation is satisfied when the trust moneys are paid out to persons entitled whatever the division. Certainly so long as the trust fund was used for a trust purpose the position of the bank would not be affected whether or not Gels unduly preferred itself in retaining out of the trust fund sufficient to recoup itself to the detriment of other beneficiaries.\nThis passage, in my opinion, correctly interprets s. 3. It appears to have been the view which the learned trial judge would have adopted had he felt free to do so.\nAfter discussing the Fonthill case Roach J.A. concluded his reasons as follows:\nWhen the $31,999.01 came into the hands of Gels it did constitute a trust fund but for the reasons stated Gels was entitled to retain it for its own use by way of recoupment for moneys expended out of its own pocket for labour and material that had gone into the job and for payments made to subcontractors without thereby committing a breach of the trust. This it did by putting that money within the reach of the bank which, as it was entitled to do, applied it on Gels\u2019 indebtedness. That indebtedness had been incurred in the first place when the bank advanced moneys to Gels so that Gels could thus expend it.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs and the action dismissed with costs. With respect, it appears to me that in the first sentence of this passage Roach J.A. overlooked an aspect of the matter to which the learned trial judge had called attention. After considering the argument of counsel for the bank that there had been no breach of trust on the part of Gels because it had expended out of its own funds in fulfilment of the contract during the month of October more than $31,999.01, Gale J. continued:\nHad the argument on behalf of the Bank on this point succeeded, it would not have meant necessarily that the action would be dismissed. I say that for this reason: the trust could only be discharged to the extent that all payments made by Gels out of its own funds exceeded any monies retained by it from draws. In other words, to make subsection (3) effective, it would have to be shown that the total of all monies paid out by Gels on the contract prior to October 27 was at least $31,999.01 greater than the total of draws received by it prior to that date, and the fact that Gels expended more in October that it received in that month would not automatically give it the right to keep the whole of the $31,999.01.\nI also venture to add that had I been obliged to consider this last point, I would have been inclined to the view, having regard to Pleet v. Canadian Northern Quebec R.W. Co., 50 O.L.R.223, affirmed [1923] 4 D.L.R. 1112, that the onus of establishing that the whole or any part of the $31,999.01 was released from the trust would rest upon the Bank.\nI am in agreement with the first paragraph of this passage. It will be necessary to consider the second paragraph later.\nIn answer to questions from the bench counsel for the appellant and for the respondent stated that it is not possible to determine from the evidence in the record whether, as of October 27, 1960, the total of all payments made by Gels out of its own funds in fulfilment of the contract exceeded the total moneys retained by it out of sums received by it on account of the contract price.\nIn this state of affairs it would at first appear that judgment must go against the party on whom lay the onus of proving the matters of fact referred to in the preceding paragraph. For the appellant it was contended that the onus lay upon the bank not only for the reason indicated by the learned trial judge in the second paragraph of the passage last quoted above but also because it was established that the bank had appropriated in discharge of Gels\u2019 personal liability to it moneys which it knew that Gels had received in trust. The appellant argues that the fact that under certain circumstances Gels might also turn out to be a beneficiary of the trust was not sufficient to place on the plaintiff the onus of proving that Gels was not beneficially entitled to the trust fund.\nFor the respondent bank it is argued that the plaintiff having alleged a breach of trust the onus of shewing that Gels was not entitled as beneficiary lay upon the plaintiff because until that was shewn there was no proof that a breach of trust had been committed.\nI have reached the conclusion that in the circumstances of this case the onus lay upon the respondent bank to shew that Gels was entitled as beneficiary to all or part of the $31,999.01, and that it has not discharged that onus.\nIn determining what result flows from this it is necessary to consider the course of the proceedings at the trial. Before any evidence was called an agreement as to certain facts was filed. It concludes with the following paragraph:\n8. Should it be held that the sum of $31,999.01 is subject to a trust and there was any breach of trust with respect thereto to which the bank was a party and a reference is directed, the parties shall be free to adduce such evidence as they see fit as to the amount of the payment of $31,999.01 discharged from the trust and the amounts of the claims of the plaintiff and other subcontractors on whose behalf this action has been brought thereagainst.\nIt does not appear to me that the wording of this paragraph relieved either party from the necessity of leading such evidence as was necessary to prove or disprove that (i) the sum of $31,999.01 or part thereof, was subject to a trust, (ii) that there was a breach of that trust, and (iii) that the bank was a party to the breach. Unless each of these three matters were found the action would fail and there would be no occasion for a reference.\nOn the evidence in the record and the findings of the learned trial judge it is established that Gels received the $31,999.01 impressed with the trust created by s. 3 of The Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act, that the claims of several beneficiaries under that trust remained unpaid and that the bank with knowledge of these facts applied the sum in question in reduction of the personal liability of Gels to it. If the matter rested there it would appear that the appeal should be allowed and the judgment at trial restored. It does however appear from the record that Gels paid substantial sums to subcontractors out of its own funds. As already pointed out, there is no way of determining from the record as it stands whether or not the total of the sums so paid by Gels for work done and materials supplied in performance of the contract exceeded the total of all payments received by it on account of the contract price. The judgment at the trial directs a reference in the following terms:\n4. AND THIS COURT DOTH FURTHER DIRECT a reference to the Master of the Supreme Court of Ontario to ascertain which of the plaintiff and all others on whose behalf it sues under Section 3 of the Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act, are to participate in the said fund, and their respective degrees of participation, the parties to be free to adduce upon such reference such evidence as they see fit as to the amount of the said sum of $31,999.01, subsequently discharged from the trust and the amount of the claims of the plaintiff and all others on whose behalf it sued thereagainst.\nIt would not appear that on the reference so directed the bank could give evidence to shew that Gels was beneficially entitled to all or part of the sum of $31,999.01; the judgment decides the contrary. While the judgment was founded primarily on the view of the law propounded in the passage from the judgment in the Fonthill case, quoted above, which has now been rejected, the learned trial judge also indicated his inclination to the view that the onus of proving that Gels was beneficially entitled to all or any part of the sum in question lay upon the bank and had not been discharged. I have already expressed my agreement with this view.\nIn the circumstances it appears to me that the proper course is to allow the appeal and restore the judgment at the trial.\nI wish, however, to rest my judgment also on another ground put forward by counsel for the appellant. Assuming, for the purposes of this branch of the matter, that in fact when Gels deposited the cheque for $31,999.01 the total of all payments made by it out of its own funds in fulfilment of the contract exceeded by that amount the total of all payments received by it on account of the contract price, the result would not be that the $31,999.01 was not subject to the statutory trust created by s. 3; it would be, as pointed out by Roach J.A., that Gels was trustee of the fund and also one of the beneficiaries of the trust. In Minneapolis-Honeywell Regulator Co. Ltd. v. Empire Brass Manufacturing Co. Ltd.[3], Rand J. was speaking for the majority of the Court when he held that s. 19 of the Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act of British Columbia, which is indistinguishable from s. 3(1) of the Ontario Act, did not re quire the statutory trustee (in that case a subcontractor) to make a pro rata distribution among the beneficiaries. His actual words at p.697 were:\nSection 19 does not, however, require that they be distributed on a pro rata basis. The subcontractor has, in this respect, a discretionary power, and his obligation is satisfied when the trust moneys are paid out to persons entitled, whatever the division. This, of course, might be affected by rights of unpaid trust creditors under other provisions of law.\nThis pronouncement appears to treat the trust created by the statute as an exception to the general rule that a trustee must hold an even hand between the beneficiaries and not benefit one at the expense of the others but, accepting it as stating the rule applicable to this trust, the situation is as follows. When Gels received the $31,999.01 it did so as trustee but had a discretionary power to pay it to one or more of the beneficiaries to the exclusion of the others. It had therefore, in the assumed situation, a discretion to retain it all for itself. Gels acted throughout by its general manager Livingstone and it appears to me that the only reasonable inference to be drawn from the relevant evidence is that Livingstone decided not to retain the money for Gels but to pay it out to the plaintiff and the others on whose behalf the plaintiff sues. It is elementary that a trustee cannot delegate the exercise of a discretion committed to him by the instrument creating the trust and a fortiori he cannot be compelled by a creditor who is a stranger to the trust to exercise his discretion in a particular manner which will benefit that stranger to the detriment of the beneficiaries.\nWe are not here concerned with any question which would arise if the bank without knowledge of the existence of the trust had acquired legal title to the trust fund. The findings that the branch manager was fully aware of the existence of the trust and of the intention of Gels to distribute the fund among the beneficiaries other than itself cannot be successfully challenged.\nFor these reasons I have reached the conclusion that even if the state of the accounts, which was not proved, was such that Gels had the right to retain the $31,999.01 this circumstance would not assist the respondent; Gels did not elect to exercise the right of retention. Gels\u2019 relationship to the bank was that of a debtor to its creditor; its relationship to the plaintiff and those on whose behalf it sues was a dual one, that of a debtor to its creditors and that of a trustee to the beneficiaries of the trust. It chose to exercise its discretion in favour of the beneficiaries; the bank had no standing to require it to alter that choice. On this view it does not matter whether the state of the accounts in connection with the contract was such that Gels would have had the right to retain the fund in question for its own use had it seen fit to do so.\nWith respect, I think that Roach J.A. was in error when he said, at the conclusion of his reasons in the passage quoted above, that Gels by putting the money within the reach of the bank was evidencing an intention to retain it for its own use. The evidence is to the contrary. Livingstone\u2019s intention, which in the circumstances was the intention of Gels, was to follow an established practice of depositing the trust moneys in Gel\u2019s only bank account and paying it out forthwith to its subcontractors who were beneficiaries of the trust; that this was his intention was well known to the branch manager of the bank.\nTo summarize, it is my opinion that the appeal succeeds on two grounds. Firstly, it having been established that the $31,999.01 came into the possession of Gels impressed with the trust created by subs. (1) of s. 3 of The Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act and that there were unpaid subcontractors who were prima facie entitled to the trust fund, the onus of proving the facts, if they existed, which would bring the case within the exception created by subs. (3) lay upon the bank and that onus was not satisfied. Secondly, even if the state of the accounts at the date when the $31,999.01 was received by Gels was such that it was entitled under subs. (3) to retain that sum for its own use, its decision whether or not to do so involved the exercise of a discretion vested in it as trustee and the only inference that can reasonably be drawn from the evidence is that it decided to exercise that discretion in favour of the plaintiff and those on whose behalf it sues and not in its own favour.\nI would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge. The appellant will recover from the respondent bank its costs in the Court of Appeal and in this Court. JUDSON J. (dissenting):\u2014This action was brought by the Clarkson Company Limited as trustee for certain lien claimants against the Canadian Bank of Commerce and Gels General Contractors Limited for breach of trust. The contractor was alleged to have received a certain cheque for $31,999.01 as trustee under s. 3(1) of The Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act and to have misapplied it by enabling the bank to pay off an overdraft out of the proceeds of this cheque. The Court of Appeal held that the case fell within s. 3(3) of The Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act and that there was no breach of trust. In so finding they disapproved of the dictum in Fonthill Lumber Limited v. Bank of Montreal[4]. That dictum had said that the right given by s. 3(3) was merely a right of retention. The Court of Appeal held that it did not mean retention as part of the trust fund but enabled the contractor, where the conditions of subs. (3) were met, to use the money for the discharge of his own obligations.\nI agree with this interpretation of subs. (3). It is clear that the learned trial judge would himself have placed the same interpretation on the subsection had he not considered himself bound by the decision in Fonthill. It has to be remembered that the ratio of the trial decision in this case was that there was a breach of trust because subs. (3) did not authorize more than a retention.\nNow the argument is submitted to us that there was a breach of trust unless the third party, the bank that received the money, can show by going through every draw on the contract (and it should be noted that this was the tenth draw) that the job owed the construction company at least $31,999.01 more than the total of the draws. Each side on the appeal admitted that the case had not been presented in such a way as to make this possible. The appellant says that the onus was on the bank to do this. With this I do not agree. The plaintiff, in instituting this action, undertook the burden when he sued a third party of proving a trust and proving knowing participation in the breach of trust, and I think that the Court of Appeal was right in finding on a review of the facts of the case that subs. (3) applied, that there was no breach of trust, that the construction company was entitled to apply the cheque in payment of its overdraft, and that the bank was entitled to receive this payment. The facts are set out in great detail in the reasons at trial[5] and summarized in the reasons of the Court of Appeal[6]. All that I need to say is that they show that the construction company was borrowing from the bank from month to month for the purpose of paying accounts for the job, that when the time approached for another draw it was heavily in debt to the bank, that whenever it deposited a cheque for the draw it cleared off the existing indebtedness as far as the cheque would go and then began to borrow again to pay off more debts. It was always behind because the owner never did or could pay everything owing up to the date of the cheque. For example, the cheque for $31,999.01 in question in this action was dated October 27, 1960 and was issued pursuant to a progress certificate from the architects dated October 13, 1960, which, in turn, was based upon a requisition issued by the construction company dated September 30, 1960.\nI have no doubt that when the construction company deposited this cheque it expected to go on as before. It issued cheques on October 28 payable to subcontractors. These were dishonoured because the bank appropriated the whole of the cheque, which reduced the overdraft to $6,417.70, and then refused to honour further cheques. It is clear that the bank had given no undertaking that it would continue to honour cheques for which there were no funds and that the construction company when it made the deposit had not attempted to impose any conditions that further cheques would be honoured.\nIn these circumstances and with the rejection of the interpretation given to subs. (3) in the Fonthill case, I am in full agreement with the reasons of Roach J.A. in the Court of Appeal that there was no breach of trust in the deposit of this cheque into an overdrawn account and that the bank was entitled to apply it on the overdraft.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs, JUDSON J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Timmins and Bristow, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the defendants, respondents: Blake, Cassells & Graydon, Toronto.\n[1] [1965] 1 O.R. 197, 47 D.L.R.

All of the shareholders were parties to agreements which provided that before any one shareholder could sell to an outsider, he must first offer his shares to the other shareholders, who were entitled to purchase proportionately to their existing holdings. M Co., the holder of 17,500 shares out of a total of 50,000 shares, offered to sell to the other shareholders all of its shares. The plaintiff, G, who was already the holder of 1,250 shares, accepted the offer. He paid the purchase price in full for the 17,500 shares and took delivery of a certificate endorsed by M Co. However, there was an interval of one month between the purchase of the shares and the registration of G as a shareholder in connection with his new acquisition. This delay was the result of the company\u2019s by-laws which required a resolution of the directors and a ten days\u2019 notice for the calling of a meeting.\nIn the meantime, two other shareholders, I and N, holding respectively 4,500 and 4,125 shares in the company, made an offer to the other shareholders to sell all their shares. Their offer was accepted by all the other shareholders, who were then only five in number. G, when he accepted, claimed the right to purchase proportionately to a holding of 18,750 shares. The other shareholders disputed G\u2019s right to count the 17,500 shares not yet registered in determining the proportion of the I-N shares that he was entitled to purchase.\nIn an action by G for a declaration, judgment was given in favour of the defendants. The trial judge decided that in the two agreements made among the shareholders the word \u201cshareholders\u201d meant \u201cregistered shareholders.\u201d On appeal, the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, holding that G was a shareholder with reference to the 17,500 shares. From this decision the defendant shareholders appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThroughout the agreements the words used were \u201cshareholders\u201d and \u201cshareholdings.\u201d There was nothing which required the construction that \u201cshareholders\u201d meant \u201cregistered shareholders\u201d or that \u201cshareholdings\u2019 meant \u201cregistered shareholdings\u201d. The trial judge\u2019s construction. if adopted, would mean that a block of 17,500 shares out of a total issue of 50,000 shares would be disqualified for the count and that the advantage of pre\u2011emption attached to these shares would be distributed among the four other shareholders. There was no logical or practical reason why such a result should follow. The argument that G was disqualified because, in purchasing the 17,500 shares, he had a partner who had provided part of the funds on the understanding that he would be entitled to an undivided 72 per cent interest in the block and that G would be entitled to the remaining 28 per cent interest was rejected. G was bound as to the whole block by his shareholder agreements. He was trustee of the block to the extent of his associate\u2019s interest but always subject to the terms of these agreements.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], allowing an appeal from a judgment of Donnelly J. Appeal dismissed.\nAllan Findlay, Q.C., for the defendants, appellants.\nDouglas K. Laidlaw, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014The dispute in this litigation is among a group of shareholders in Federal Packaging and Partition Company Limited, a private company, concerning their rights to purchase shares from each other in the company. All the shareholders were parties to agreements which provided that before any one shareholder could sell to an outsider, he must first offer his shares to the other shareholders, who were entitled to purchase proportionately to their existing holdings.\nThe facts are not in dispute. They are fully stated in the reasons delivered in the Court of Appeal1. The Court of Appeal held that a person who had purchased and paid for shares but had not yet secured registration as a shareholder on the books of the company was to be counted as a shareholder for the purpose of determining the proportionate rights to purchase when a further offer from other shareholders was made. The trial judge held to the contrary.\nOn May 14, 1962, Martin Paper Products Limited, the holder of 17,500 shares out of a total issue of 50,000 shares, offered to sell to the other shareholders all of its shares for $120,000, that is, at a price of $6.86 per share. The offer was to remain open for acceptance until the close of business on May 23, 1962. On that date the plaintiff, Robert M. Gaby, who was already the holder of 1,250 shares, accepted the offer. No other shareholders accepted Martin\u2019s offer.\nOn May 25, 1962, Gaby paid the purchase price in full for the 17,500 shares and took delivery of a certificate endorsed by the Martin Company. On May 29, his solicitors sent to Federal Packaging a share certificate to have Gaby registered as the owner of the 17,500 shares. This certificate was received on May 30, 1962. The directors, pursuant to the by-laws of the company, had to call a meeting with ten days\u2019 notice for the approval of the transfer. The meeting was held on June 25, 1962. The transfer was approved and Gaby was entered on the books of the company as the holder of these 17,500 shares. There was, therefore, an interval of a month between the purchase of the shares and the registration of Gaby as a shareholder in connection with his new acquisition.\nIn the meantime, on May 23, 1962, two other shareholders, W. Imrie and O.G. Nash, holding respectively 4,500 and 4,125 shares in the company, made an offer to the other shareholders to sell all their shares at $3.50 per share. This price was well below the price at which the Martin Company had offered its shares. The Imrie-Nash offers were to be accepted before twelve o\u2019clock noon on May 29, 1962. The Martin Company had already sold its shares and Imrie and Nash were engaged in selling their shares. Their offer was accepted by all the other shareholders, who were then only five in number. Gaby, when he accepted, claimed the right to purchase proportionately to a holding of 18,750 shares. This was made up of 1,250 shares which he had held for some time and which were registered in his name, and the 17,500 shares which he had just acquired from the Martin Company but had not yet been able to register and was not able to register until June 25, 1962. The other shareholders disputed Gaby\u2019s right to count the 17,500 shares not yet registered in determining the proportion of the Imrie-Nash shares that he was entitled to purchase. This is the whole dispute.\nThe other shareholders say that according to the agreements that they made the only shares that could be counted were those registered on the books of the company. Gaby says that he was a shareholder with reference to the 17,500 shares because he was entitled to registration, having bought and paid for the shares, and that the delay was merely the result of the company\u2019s by-laws which required a resolution of the directors and a ten days\u2019 notice for the calling of the meeting.\nThe learned trial judge decided that in the two agreements made among the shareholders the word \u201cshareholders\u201d meant only \u201cregistered shareholders.\u201d The Court of Appeal held that Gaby was a shareholder with reference to the 17,500 shares. I agree with this construction. Throughout the agreements the words used are \u201cshareholders\u201d and \u201cshareholdings.\u201d I can see nothing which requires the construction that \u201cshareholders\u201d means \u201cregistered shareholders\u201d or that \u201cshareholdings\u201d means \u201cregistered shareholdings.\u201d If the trial judge\u2019s construction is adopted, it means that a block of 17,500 shares out of a total issue of 50,000 shares is disqualified for the count and that the advantage of pre-emption attached to these shares is distributed among the four other shareholders. There is no logical or practical reason why such a result should follow. It was the merest accident that the Imrie-Nash offer followed so closely on the Martin Company offer at a time when the Martin Company shares which had been validly sold had not been registered in the name of the new owner. Gaby was the owner in equity of these shares and as soon as it was possible he became the registered owner. It requires a very highly technical construction of the agreement to deprive him of his rights of pre-emption along with the other four remaining shareholders. The Martin Company had parted with these shares. It could not accept the Imrie-Nash offer even though it remained the registered shareholder. Imrie and Nash were out of the competition. This left only five shareholders, including Gaby. If the 17,500 shares are not to be counted in Gaby\u2019s hands, there is a big bonus to the other four shareholders.\nWhen the parties were unable to agree upon proportionate participation in the Imrie-Nash offer, the solicitors acting for these two shareholders directed the transfer in accordance with Gaby\u2019s contention. I think that they were right in so doing and that the Court of Appeal judgment was right in affirming these directions.\nIn argument before us, much was made of the practical difficulties which would arise among the shareholders if the construction of \u201cregistered shareholders\u201d was rejected. These practical difficulties do not exist with a company of this size.\nThe difficulties of the company were also emphasized if the construction of \u201cregistered shareholders\u201d was rejected. Again, I see no difficulty. The company in sending out notices and paying dividends must be governed by the share register. But matters of this kind are not in issue here.\nFinally, the appellants urged that Gaby, in purchasing the 17,500 shares, had a partner who had provided part of the funds on the understanding that he would be entitled to an undivided 72 per cent interest in the block and that Gaby would be entitled to the remaining 28 per cent interest. This means no more than this, that Gaby would become the registered owner of the whole block. He would be trustee for his associate as to 72 per cent of the shares in the block. I cannot see that this disqualifies Gaby. The company, when Gaby became registered, could only recognize him as the shareholder. If Gaby wished to sell the block at any time he could only do so on the terms of first offering the shares to the other shareholders pursuant to the agreements to which he was a party. There is no question of the associate becoming a registered shareholder. Gaby is bound as to the whole block by his shareholder agreements. He is trustee of the block to the extent of his associate\u2019s interest but always subject to the terms of these agreements.\nI agree with the reasons of the Court of Appeal and I would dismiss the appeal with costs payable by the appellants.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendants, appellants: Tilley, Carson, Findlay and Wedd, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: McCarthy and McCarthy, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Kilmer, Rumball, Gordon, Davis and Smith, Toronto.\n[1] [1966] 1 O.R. 15, 52 D.L.R.

The collision occurred at the intersection of a through highway and a concession road. At the time of the accident the plaintiff\u2019s car was being driven northerly on the highway and the defendant C was driving his car westerly on the concession road. The highway had been marked at the intersection by a stop sign. This sign and its location conformed to the relevant regulations but four days prior to the accident some mischievous boys had turned it around so that as C\u2019s car approached it the driver would not see a stop sign but only the back of the sign which was gray in colour and bore no lettering.\nAction was brought for damages suffered by the plaintiff personally and also, pursuant to The Fatal Accidents Act, for damages for the death of his wife. The trial judge found that both the defendant Department of Highways and the defendant C were at fault and apportioned the blame 80 per cent to the former and 20 per cent to the latter. He assessed the damages of the plaintiff personally at $145,795.43 and the damages under The Fatal Accidents Act at $11,300.\nEach of the parties appealed to the Court of Appeal. The defendant Department sought the dismissal of the action as against it, alternatively a reduction of the percentage of blame attributed to it and a reduction in the amount of damages. The defendant C by cross-appeal asked that he be absolved from liability and alternatively that the damages be reduced. The plaintiff by cross-appeal asked that the award of damages to him personally be increased. The plaintiff\u2019s cross-appeal was allowed, his total damages being assessed at $180,000. The Department\u2019s appeal and C\u2019s cross-appeal were dismissed.\nThe majority in the Court of Appeal were of the opinion that the trial judge had erred in his assessment of damages in regard to the following matters: (1) The trial judge had deducted $50,000 from the total damages on the ground that had the plaintiff been well and normal for the next five years his own personal living expenses would have been $10,000 a year whereas all his estimated living expenses during that period would in fact be covered by an amount which was allowed for hospital expenses. This deduction should not have been made. At most the deduction should have been for not more than a sum sufficient to cover the plaintiff\u2019s food and lodging as distinguished from medical and nursing care in the hospital for five years. (2) There should not have been any reduction made in the damages for loss of future earnings by reason of income tax. (3) The allowance for general damages of $2,000 for loss of enjoyment of life should have been for loss of the amenities of life and was too low. (4) The allowance for loss in respect of certain stock options was too high. That there could be no certainty as to the price of the stock at the time the options would be taken up and that other circumstances might have prevented the plaintiff exercising the options were factors that should have been taken into consideration. (5) In allowing loss of salary for five years some allowance should have been made not only for the fact that the salary was being paid in advance but also some deduction should have been made for the contingency that the plaintiff might have, within that period of time, become ill or died or for other reason might have lost his position.\nAn appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal was brought to this Court. The Department asked that the action as against it be dismissed and alternatively that the assessment of the trial judge should be restored. C as cross-appellant asked that the action as against him be dismissed.\nHeld: The appeal and cross-appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Cartwright, Martland, Ritchie and Spence JJ.: The appellant\u2019s contention that failure to maintain a stop sign as required by the relevant statute (The Highway Improvement Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 171) and regulations does not amount to \u201cdefault to keep the King\u2019s Highway in repair\u201d was rejected. Its further contention that even if, contrary to its submission, the failure to maintain the stop sign constituted default in keeping the highway in repair the appellant was relieved from liability by the terms of subs. (3) of s. 33 of the Act was also rejected.\nFor the reasons given by McGillivray J.A. in the Court below, it was agreed that the collision was caused by the fault of both defendants and that the apportionment of the blame made by the trial judge ought not to be disturbed.\nOn the question of the quantum of damages, as to the deduction of $50,000, at the most the amount of this deduction should not have exceeded such portion of the estimated hospital expenses of $20,075 as represented the cost of food, and possibly the cost of lodging. As to item (3), the allowance of $2,000 for loss of amenities of life was very much too low. Damages for loss of amenities of life are not to be reduced by reason of the fact that the injured person is unconsicious and unaware of his condition. As to item (4), the allowance in respect of the loss of the right to exercise options to purchase stock, the estimate of the trial judge if excessive at all was not greatly so. As to item (5), it appeared that the trial judge did allow for the fact that the salary was in effect being paid in advance, and in view of the circumstances of the case no substantial amount should have been deducted by reason of the other contingencies to which reference was made.\nOn a consideration of the whole record, the total amount of $180,000 fixed by the Court of Appeal was not excessive and should not be disturbed.\nPer Curiam: The principle stated in British Transport Commission v. Gourley, [1956] A.C. 185, (the incidence of taxation on future earnings should be taken into account in assessing damages in respect of loss of such earnings) was rejected.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], dismissing the appeal of the present appellant and the cross-appeal of the respondent Cronsberry from a judgment of Ferguson J., and allowing the cross-appeal of the respondent Jennings as to the quantum of damages awarded. Appeal dismissed.\nC.L. Dubin, Q.C., K. Duncan Finlayson, Q.C., and P.J. Brunner, for the defendant, appellant.\nRoss V. Smiley, Q.C., for the defendant, respondent and cross-appellant, G. Cronsberry.\nB.J. Thomson, Q.C., for the plaintiff, respondent, R.M. Jennings.\nMartland, Ritchie and Spence JJ. concurred with the judgment delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1 allowing a cross-appeal by the respondent Jennings, varying a judgment of Ferguson J. by increasing the amount of the damages awarded to Jennings personally from $145,795.53 to $180,000 and dismissing the appeal of the present appellant and the cross-appeal of the respondent Cronsberry. McGillivray J.A., dissenting in part, would have affirmed the judgment of the learned trial Judge.\nThe action arose out of a collision between an automobile, hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Jennings car\u201d, owned by the respondent Jennings in which he and his wife the late Mary Jennings were passengers and which was being driven by their son William E. Jennings and an automobile, hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Cronsberry car\u201d owned and driven, by the respondent Cronsberry. The collision occurred at about 5 p.m. on Sunday, November 5, 1961, at the intersection of Highway No. 12 which runs North and South, with the Second Concession road of the Township of Thorah which runs East and West.\nThe Jennings car was being driven northerly on Highway No. 12 at a speed of about 60 miles per hour which was a lawful speed. The Cronsberry car was being driven westerly on the Second Concession road. Highway No. 12 was a through highway and the Second Concession road was a \u201cstop street\u201d. At this intersection Highway 12 had been marked by a stop sign placed at the northeast corner of the intersection 27 feet east of the east edge of the pavement of Highway 12 and 5 feet north of the north edge of the gravel on the Second Concession. The sign and its location conformed to the relevant statutes and regulations but on the Wednesday preceding the day of the accident some mischievous boys had turned it around so that as the Cronsberry car approached it the driver would not see a stop sign but only the back of the sign which was gray in colour and bore no lettering. Cronsberry, who suffered a concussion, had no recollection of the accident or of anything that occurred in the space of a few minutes before it happened.\nThe two cars collided with great violence in the intersection. Mrs. Jennings was killed, the respondent Jennings was so severely injured that he has never recovered consciousness. William Jennings was not seriously injured.\nThe action was brought for damages suffered by the respondent Jennings personally and also, pursuant to The Fatal Accidents Act, for damages for the death of the late Mary Jennings.\nThe learned trial judge found that both the appellant and Cronsberry were at fault and apportioned the blame 80 per cent to the former and 20 per cent to the latter. He assessed the damages of the respondent Jennings personally at $145,795.43 and the damages under The Fatal Accidents Act at $11,300.\nEach of the parties appealed to the Court of Appeal.\nThe present appellant, hereinafter sometimes referred to as \u201cthe Department\u201d, sought the dismissal of the action as against it, alternatively a reduction of the percentage of blame attributed to it and a reduction in the amount of damages.\nThe respondent Cronsberry by cross-appeal asked that he be absolved from liability and alternatively that the damages be reduced.\nThe respondent Jennings by cross-appeal asked that the award of damages to him personally be increased.\nThe result of these appeals has been stated in the opening paragraph of these reasons.\nIn this Court, the Department asks that the action as against it be dismissed and alternatively that the assessment of damages made by the learned trial judge should be restored, it does not ask any further reduction of the damages; the respondent Cronsberry asks that the action as against him be dismissed; the respondent Jennings asks that the appeal be dismissed, he does not ask that the assessment of damages made by the Court of Appeal be increased.\nNeither the appellant nor the cross-appellant Cronsberry suggests that there was any negligence on the part of the driver of the Jennings car.\nOn the question of liability there are the following findings of fact all of which are supported by the evidence; (i) that the sign was turned on the Wednesday morning preceding the accident and, notwithstanding a daily patrol by employees of the Department, was allowed to remain in that position up to the happening of the accident; (ii) that this was an unreasonable length of time; (iii) that the position of the sign was an effective cause of the collision in that had it been in its proper position it was probable that Cronsberry would have seen it and stopped before entering Highway 12; (iv) that, even if Cronsberry was unaware that the highway which he was approaching was a through highway and so was entitled to assume that he had the right of way over the Jennings car, he was negligent as he had a clear view for some hundreds of feet to the south of the intersection and could see that the Jennings car was approaching the intersection at such a rate of speed that unless Cronsberry stopped a collision would occur.\nOn this statement of facts, for the reasons given by McGillivray J.A., I agree that the collision was caused by the fault of both defendants and that the apportionment of the blame made by the learned trial judge ought not to be disturbed.\nCounsel for the appellant submitted that even if the failure to have the stop sign in position was in fact an effective cause of the collision there was no legal liability on the part of the Department. It is common ground that if such liability existed at the time of the accident it must be found in s. 33 of The Highway Improvement Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 171, the relevant subsections of which are (1)(2)(3) and (10). These read as follows:\n33 (1) The King\u2019s Highway shall be maintained and kept in repair by the Department and any municipality in which any part of the King\u2019s Highway is situate is relieved from any liability therefor, but this does not apply to any sidewalk or municipal undertaking or work constructed or in course of construction by a municipality or which a municipality may lawfully do or construct upon the highway, and the municipality is liable for want of repair of the sidewalk, municipal undertaking or work, whether the want of repair is the result of nonfeasance or misfeasance, in the same manner and to the same extent as in the case of any other like work constructed by the municipality.\n(2) In the case of default by the Department to keep the King\u2019s Highway in repair, the Crown is liable for all damage sustained by any person by reason of the default, and the amount recoverable by a person by reason of the default may be agreed upon with the Minister before or after the commencement of an action for the recovery of damages.\n(3) No action shall be brought against the Crown for the recovery of damages caused by the presence or absence or insufficiency of any wall, fence, guard rail, railing or barrier adjacent to or in, along or upon the King\u2019s Highway or caused by or on account of any construction, obstruction or erection or any situation, arrangement or disposition of any earth, rock, tree or other material or thing adjacent to or in, along or upon the King\u2019s Highway that is not on the roadway.\n(10) The liability imposed by this section does not extend to a case in which a municipality having jurisdiction and control over the highway would not have been liable for the damage sustained.\nThe appellant contends that failure to maintain a stop sign as required by the relevant statute and regulations does not amount to \u201cdefault to keep the King\u2019s Highway in repair\u201d. In the Courts below this submission has been unanimously rejected and, in my opinion, rightly so. It has been repeatedly held in Ontario that where a duty to keep a highway in repair is imposed by statute the body upon which it is imposed must keep the highway in such a condition that travellers using it with ordinary care may do so with safety. The danger created by the failure to maintain the required stop signs marking a through highway is too obvious to require comment. On this branch of the matter I agree with and wish to adopt the reasons of McGillivray J.A.\nIt was next argued by counsel for the appellant that even if, contrary to his submission, the failure to maintain the stop sign constituted default in keeping the highway in repair the appellant was relieved from liability by the terms of subs. (3) of s. 33. This point was disposed of adversely to the appellant at the hearing and counsel for Jennings and for Cronsberry were not called upon in regard to it. On this point also I am content to adopt the reasons of McGillivray J.A.\nFor the above reasons I conclude that the judgment finding both defendants liable to the plaintiff and as between them apportioning the blame 80 per cent to the Department and 20 per cent to Cronsberry should be upheld and it remains to consider the question of the quantum of the damages awarded to Jennings personally. The amount of the damages awarded pursuant to The Fatal Accidents Act is not questioned.\nJennings was born on April 16, 1909. His normal life expectancy at the date of the accident was 22, 43 years. He is a graduate engineer. In 1955 he had become general manager of the Small Appliances Department of the Canadian General Electric Company at Barrie. In 1959 he had been made a vice-president of the company. The plant had progressed rapidly and satisfactorily under his management. He was paid by way of salary plus an annual \u201cincentive bonus\u201d. His gross earnings had increased from $13,752 in 1955 to $26,294.44 in 1961. According to the evidence of Mr. Marrs, the manager of the Personnel Accounting of the company, Jennings\u2019 gross earnings in 1962 would have amounted to $30,525 and by 1967 would have increased to $34,000 a year and have continued at that rate until his retirement. If he retired at age 60 he would have received an annual retirement income of $7,025 and if he retired at 65 an annual retirement income of $11,215. Following the accident the company continued to pay his salary until the end of February 1962 when he was retired. He receives an annual retirement income of $4,842, which if he should still be living in 1974 when he reaches 65 years of age would be increased to $4,992.\nThe termination of Jennings\u2019 employment deprived him of the right to exercise certain options to purchase stock in American General Electric at fixed prices. He lost the right to purchase 594 shares at $52.25, U.S. funds, and the right to purchase 117 of such shares at $68.25, U.S. funds. At the date of the trial the current market price of the shares was $82, U.S. funds, and Mr. Marrs calculated the amount of profit which would have resulted if Jennings had exercised his option and sold the shares at the market at $19,695 U.S. funds.\nThe evidence of Dr. Harrison as to the physical condition of Jennings is uncontradicted. He suffered so severe a brain injury in the accident that he has never regained consciousness. He has been a patient at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital since January 4, 1962. He is confined to bed. He cannot speak. He cannot make any voluntary movement. He cannot swallow and is fed through a duodenal tube that passes through his nostril down to his stomach. He has a tracheotomy tube in his windpipe because without it he cannot breathe. He is incontinent as to his bladder and his bowels and has to have bladder drainage with a permanent catheter. There is no hope of recovery or improvement. He does not suffer pain and does not realize what his condition is. He is kept alive by \u201cvery meticulous care\u201d. He is taking nourishment well and Dr. Harrison was of opinion that since his admission to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital up to the date of the trial in May 1963 his general physical condition had perhaps improved. The chief danger to his life is from a secondary infection developing either in the respiratory tract or in the bladder. The examination in chief of Dr. Harrison concluded as follows:\nQ. Are you able to give his lordship any assistance as to his probable life expectancy in this condition?\nA. My lord, that is a very difficult question. Barring what you might call a medical accident, in the way of one of these medical accidents taking place, his general vital functions are such that he could almost live\u2014well, indefinitely. In my own experience out there, we had one patient that went over five years in this condition. It was the result of a motor accident. He, I may say, had many more sort of acute attacks of one sort or another during his illness than Mr. Jennings has had. I would hate to give a prognosis on whether he will live five years or ten years or even longer.\nAt the date of the hearing of the appeal in this Court, which concluded on December 17, 1965, Jennings was still alive. In approaching the assessment of damages the learned trial judge stated that his calculations were based on Jennings living for five years from the date of the trial but no longer.\nThe learned trial judge stated that while it was not customary to assess damages item by item he found it desirable to do so in this case. He allowed nothing for pain and suffering owing to the fact that Jennings has remained unconscious ever since the accident. He allowed:\nOut of pocket expenses to the date of trial, agreed upon,\n$ 13,801.53\nLoss of salary to date of trial\n33,800.00\nAdditional expenses for upkeep of son............................................................\n600.00\nExpenses of appointing Committee.................................................................\n529.00\nEstimated hospital expenses for 5 years from date of trial\n20,075.00\nEstimated medical\u2019 expenses for 5 years from date of trial\n2,600.00\nEstimated loss in connection with options to purchase stock\n18,590.00\nThe present value at the date of the trial of Jennings\u2019 loss of salary for the ensuing 5 years after deducting estimated income tax from gross earnings..............................................................................................................................\n104,000.00\nLoss of enjoyment of life.....................................................................................\n2,000.00\nThese items total $195,995.53, but apparently there was some correction not appearing in his reasons as the total arrived at by the learned trial judge was $195,795.53. From this total he deducted $50,000 on the ground that had the plaintiff been well and normal for the next five years \u201chis own personal living expenses\u201d would have been $10,000 a year whereas all his estimated living expenses during that period would in fact be covered by the item for hospital expenses set out above. In the result judgment was given for $145,795.53.\nIn the Court of Appeal, MacKay J.A., with whom Kelly J.A. agreed was of opinion that the learned trial judge had erred in his assessment in regard to five matters which he summarized as follows:\nIn light of the authorities and commentaries to which I have referred I am of the opinion that in the present case:\u2014\n(1) The sum of $50,000 should not have been deducted. At most the deduction should be for not more than a sum sufficient to cover the plaintiff\u2019s food and lodging as distinguished from medical and nursing care in the hospital for five years.\n(2) There should not have been any reduction in the damages for loss of future earnings made by reason of income tax.\n(3) The allowance for general damages of $2,000 under the heading of loss of enjoyment of life should be under the heading of loss of the amenities of life and is too low. (4) The allowance for loss in respect of stock options was too high. The contingency that there could be no certainty as to the price of the stock at the time the options would be taken up and that there might have been other circumstances arise that would prevent the plaintiff exercising the options, ie. sickness, loss of position.\n(5) In allowing loss of salary for five years some allowance should have been made not only for the fact that the five years salary is being paid in advance but also some deduction should be made for the contingency that the Plaintiff might have, within that period of time, become ill or died or for other reason might lose his position, it being, I think, reasonable to assume that in the modern business world there is no certainty of tenure in executive positions.\nMacKay J.A. concluded that $180,000 would be a fair and reasonable amount at which to assess the plaintiff\u2019s total damages.\nMcGillivray J.A., who dissented on this branch of the case, agreed in substance with the views of MacKay J.A. as to each of the five items set out above except item (2). As to that item he held that the learned trial judge was right to take into consideration the fact that had Jennings received his salary he would have had to pay income tax on it. As to item (3), McGillivray J.A. while agreeing that the amount allowed was too low considered that this involved \u201cno error in principle but a difference in view point as to what the award should be\u201d. In the result he decided that while the total awarded by the learned trial judge was perhaps somewhat less than it should have been the difference was not sufficient to warrant the Court of Appeal substituting a different figure.\nWith regard to the question raised in item (2) I agree with the reasons and conclusion of my brother Judson. Even if I had shared the view of the learned trial Judge and of McGillivray J.A. on this point I would none the less have been of the opinion that the total amount of $180,000 at which the Court of Appeal assessed the plaintiff\u2019s damages is by no means excessive.\nAs to the deduction of $50,000, I agree with the view of MacKay J.A. and that of McGillivray J.A. that at the most the amount of this deduction should not have exceeded such portion of the estimated hospital expenses of $20,075 as represented the cost of food, and possibly the cost of lodging. As McGillivray J.A. points out, this would of necessity be less than $20,075; the part is less than the whole; while it cannot be fixed with precision I am of opinion that the deduction should have been very much less than $20,075. If the percentage applied by Asquith L.J. in making a similar calculation in Shearman v. Folland[2], quoted with approval by MacKay J.A., were adopted the resulting figure would be less than $2,000.\nAs to item (3) I regard the allowance of $2,000 for loss of amenities of life as very much too low. MacKay J.A. in his reasons dealing with this branch of the matter has made a careful examination of the judgments in the recent cases of Wise v. Kaye[3] and H. West & Son Ltd. v. Shephard[4]. I am in full agreement with his view that these cases rightly decide that damages for loss of the amenities of life are not to be reduced by reason of the fact that the injured person is unconscious and unaware of his condition.\nAs to item (4), the allowance in respect of the loss of the right to exercise options to purchase stock, the evidence of Mr. Marrs shews that Jennings by reason of the termination of his employment lost the right which he would otherwise have had to purchase 594 shares in annual amounts of 217 shares up to November 18, 1965, at $52\u00bc and 117 shares in annual amounts of 15 shares up to June 28, 1967, at $68\u00bd. At the date of the trial the current market price of these shares was $82. It was Mr. Marr\u2019s opinion that the market price of this stock would move up gradually. It is true, as MacKay J.A. points out, that there was no certainty that Jennings would have realized a profit of the amount estimated by the learned trial judge. It is equally true that if the market price continued to move upward he could have realized a substantially larger profit. I do not attach any great importance to this item but in my view the estimate of the learned trial judge if excessive at all was not greatly so.\nAs to item (5), we do not know the details of the calculation by which the learned trial judge arrived at the figure of $104,000 but he expressly stated that he was taking the present value of the estimated loss of earnings and it would seem therefore that he did allow for the fact that the salary was in effect being paid in advance. In the circumstances of this case particularly in view of the evidence of Jennings\u2019 good record and high standing in the company of which he was a vice-president and of his normal life expectancy mentioned above, I do not think that any substantial amount should have been deducted by reason of the other contingencies referred to by MacKay J.A. in connection with this item.\nOn a consideration of the whole record I am satisfied that, even on the assumption that the income tax which Jennings would have had to pay had he lived and continued to earn his salary should be taken into consideration in assessing his damages, the total amount of $180,000 fixed by the Court of Appeal is not excessive and should not be disturbed.\nBefore parting with the matter I wish to make it clear that I am not expressing agreement with the view, apparently entertained by both the learned trial judge and the Court of Appeal, that because the normal live expectancy of the plaintiff of 22.43 years had been reduced by his injuries to 5 years he should be compensated only for the earnings he would have been expected to receive during the 5 year period.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs payable to Jennings and dismiss the cross-appeal of Cronsberry with costs payable to Jennings. The appeal fails as against Cronsberry and Cronsberry\u2019s cross-appeal fails as against the appellant; as between Cronsberry and the appellant I would make no order as to costs in this Court.\nMartland, Ritchie and Spence JJ. concurred with the judgment delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014Before 1956, the problem involved in British Transport Commission v. Gourley[5] had been considered in only three reported cases in Ontario. They were decisions at trial and had followed Billingham v. Hughes[6]. Since 1956 the Gourley case has been applied in three reported cases from Alberta, Newfoundland and Ontario, and not applied in one case from Manitoba and one from Quebec. The cases are listed in [1965] 2 O.R. 297, with the exception of the recent Quebec decision in Leroy v. Perini Ltd., which is now in appeal.\nIn the present case, the trial judge did follow Gourley. The majority in the Court of Appeal rejected this but for different reasons. MacKay J.A. expressed a preference for the dissenting opinion of Lord Keith and also agreed with Kelly J.A. that a proper foundation had not been laid for the application of the principle. Kelly J.A. confined his reasons to the second ground. He said that a defendant, seeking because of the incidence of income tax to reduce damages otherwise payable, must satisfy the court that the award is in fact tax free and then adduce the necessary evidence on which the court can assess the net amount of the award. Both elements, in his opinion, were lacking. McGillivray J.A. held, in agreement with the trial judge, that the principle in Gourley did apply and that the award, as a whole, was satisfactory and should not be interfered with. The majority increased the award from $146,000 to $180,000, only part of the increase being attributable to their rejection of Gourley.\nAll points of appeal, of which the application of the principle in Gourley was only one, were argued in this Court and it is necessary that we should face the issue and express an opinion. It is important not only for future litigation but for every-day practice in a contentious field where settlements are frequent.\nGourley was decided upon an admission of counsel that the damages were a non-taxable capital receipt. This admission was taken to be an accurate reflection of the law and of the practice of the Inland Revenue.\nFor what it is worth, my opinion is that an award of damages for impairment of earning capacity would not be taxable under the Canadian Income Tax Act. To the extent that an award includes an identifiable sum for loss of earnings up to the date of judgment the result might well be different. But I know of no decisions where these issues have been dealt with and until this has been done in proceedings in which the Minister of National Revenue is a party, any expression of opinion must be insecure. Such litigation would have to go through the Board of Tax Appeals or direct to the Exchequer Court with a final appeal, in appropriate cases, to this Court. As matters stand at present this ground alone is perhaps sufficient for the rejection of the principle in Gourley.\nI would, however, put my rejection upon broader grounds. I agree with the dissenting opinion of Lord Keith in the Gourley case and the minority views expressed in the 7th Report of the Law Reform Committee on the effect of tax liability on damages, published in August of 1958. These are stated in the following paragraphs:\n(a) Damages should, so far as any monetary award can do so, restore the plaintiff to the position in which he would have stood but for the defendant\u2019s wrongdoing. On this basis they should represent compensation for loss of earning capacity and not for loss of earnings. In a case of personal injuries, what the plaintiff has lost is the whole or part, as the case may be, of his natural capital equipment and to tax him on this is contrary to generally accepted principles of taxation.\n(b) What the plaintiff would have done or have been required to do with his money had he not suffered the injury complained of is, so far as the defendant is concerned, irrelevant. Tax is not a charge on income before it is received and there is no more reason for taking it into account than rates, mortgage interest and any other liabilities which the plaintiff may have to meet. To do so means that the defendant is making something less than full restitution for the injury. In other words, each \u00a31 of income lost is worth \u00a31 to the plaintiff, either to spend on himself, or to discharge his liabilities, including that for income tax.\n(c) The net sum representing what the plaintiff would have received after deduction of tax is not adequate compensation for loss of the ability to deal freely with the gross sum. Not only is the plaintiff deprived of his chance of dealing with his income as he thinks fit and so reducing his liability to tax, but third parties who might otherwise have benefited from such arrangements as the plaintiff might be disposed to make are unable to do so.\n(d) The present law operates in some cases in a way which is contrary to public policy. Thus it is now frequently more profitable to pay damages for the breach of a contract of service than to perform the contract, because by paying damages the employer saves the amount of the tax on the employee\u2019s salary.\nIt has been said that if the incidence of taxation on future earnings is ignored, the plaintiff is being over-compensated. With this I do not agree. A lump sum award under this head is at best no more than rough-and-ready compensation. There must be very few plaintiffs who are compelled to take a lump sum who would not be better off with their earning capacity unimpaired or a periodic reassessment of the effect of its impairment. There is, as things are at present, no possibility of such a reassessment. But mathematical precision is impossible in assessing the lump sum, and where large amounts and serious permanent disability are involved, I think that the award is usually a guess to the detriment of the plaintiff.\nTo assess another uncertainty\u2014the incidence of income tax over the balance of the working life of a plaintiff\u2014and then deduct the figure reached from an award is, in my opinion, an undue preference for the case of the defendant or his insurance company. The plaintiff has been deprived of his capacity to earn income. It is the value of that capital asset which has to be assessed. In making that determination it is proper and necessary to estimate the future income earning capacity of the plaintiff, that is, his ability to produce dollar income, if he had not been injured. This estimate must be made in relation to his net income, account being taken of expenditures necessary to earn the income. But income tax is not an element of cost in earning income. It is a disposition of a portion of the earned income required by law. Consequently, the fact that the plaintiff would have been subject to tax on future income, had he been able to earn it, and that he is not required to pay tax upon the award of damages for his loss of capacity to earn income does not mean that he is over-compensated if the award is not reduced by an amount equivalent to the tax. It merely reflects the fact that the state has not elected to demand payment of tax upon that kind of a receipt of money. It is not open to the defendant to complain about this consequence of tax policy and the courts should not transfer this benefit to the defendant or his insurance company.\nThe speculative and unsatisfactory result that may follow from a deduction for future income tax may be illustrated from the Gourley case itself. As pointed out in Street, Principles of the Law of Damages, p. 102, if Gourley had been able to postpone the trial for two years, he would inevitably have received several thousand pounds more by way of damages.\nThe practical difficulties that arise from the application of the principle are many and they have been noticed. What is to be done with the young plaintiff who had a promising career ahead of him? If he is unmarried or newly married, how does the Court deal with his potential exemptions? How does it deal with the complexities that may arise from a wife\u2019s separate income? Why should it be assumed that investment income is necessarily permanent or that it will always remain taxable in the hands of the plaintiff? What will be done with the foreign plaintiff and foreign systems of taxation? In this country there are additional difficulties. Each of the provinces has the power to impose taxation upon income, and there is no assurance that the total impact of federal and provincial tax upon taxpayers in each of the provinces will remain the same. At the same time there is a considerable and increasing movement of people from one province to another. To deduct from an award of damages for loss of earning capacity an amount based upon the existing tax rates in the province in which he lived at the time of his injury might well create a hardship for a man who might reasonably have anticipated, in the future, a transfer of his employment to another province in which the rate of taxation is less.\nIn the litigation itself there are practical difficulties. There will be discovery on income tax matters with its possibilities of oppressive and endless examination. There are also problems of onus of proof. I notice that West Suffolk County Council v. W. Rought Ltd.[7] put the burden on the plaintiff. The Ontario Court of Appeal, in the present case, put the burden on the defendant. Finally, how does the principle fit in with lump sum awards either from a judge or jury or with jury trials at all in these cases?\nI agree with Cartwright J. that the appeal should be dismissed with costs but I think that we should say now that we reject the principle stated in Gourley.\nAppeal dismissed with costs; cross-appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Kingsmill, Mills, Price, Barret & Finlayson, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: Haines, Thomson, Rogers, Macaulay, Howie & Freeman, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Smiley & Allingham, Toronto.\n[1][1965] 2 O.R. 285, 50 D.L.R.

One of the trucks was damaged in an accident, and, in a later accident, the other was seriously damaged if not totally destroyed by fire. The appellant made no claim in this action in respect of the direct damage sustained by either of his vehicles but contended that the failure of the Government Insurance Office to comply with the terms of ss. 36(8) (2) and 36(13) of the Act resulted in delays which had the effect of putting him out of business altogether and in this regard he claimed in respect of each truck special damages in the amount of $50,000 and general damages of $100,000. The appellant's claims were dismissed by the trial judge and an appeal from his judgments was dismissed by the Court of Appeal.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe appellant's contention that the failure by the insurer to give the notice for which provision is made in s. 36(8) (2) constituted a breach of the statute failed. The section only requires notice to be given in a case where the insurer intends to \"repair, rebuild or replace the property damaged\". In the present cases the insurer had no such intention and the provision for notice was accordingly inapplicable.\nThe provisions of s. 36(13), which provide that the insurer \"shall pay any insurance money for which it is liable within sixty days after the proof of loss has been received by it, or, where an appraisal is had under statutory condition 9, within fifteen days after the award is rendered\", could have no relevance to the claim for the fire loss as no award had yet been rendered in respect of that loss.\nThe Insurance Office had disputed certain items in the proof of loss filed in respect of the accident claim and no money was paid within sixty days after it had been received. However, the only insurance for which provision was made in the \"owner's certificate\" referred to in s. 35(1) was insurance \"against direct and accidental loss of or damage to the vehicle designated therein\u2026\" The insurer under such a certificate was not responsible for consequential loss or damage such as that claimed by the appellant. Also, under s. 36(8) (1), it was provided that the insurer's liability \"\u2026shall in no event exceed what it would cost to repair or replace the vehicle\u2026\". APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan, dismissing an appeal from two judgments of Davis J. Appeal dismissed.\nGilles E. B\u00e9dard, in person, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nW. Bellesberger, for the defendant, respondent.\nTHE COURT:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan dismissing an appeal from two judgments of Mr. Justice C. S. Davis whereby he dismissed two claims of the appellant for damages arising out of alleged breaches by the Saskatchewan Government Insurance Office of the provisions of s. 36 subss. 8 and 13 of The Automobile Accident Insurance Act, 1963 (Sask.), c. 38 (hereinafter referred to as \"the Act\").\nAt all times material hereto the appellant was the owner of two power unit trucks of identical make and model with which he engaged in the transportation business in the Province of Saskatchewan and both of which were insured in accordance with the provisions of s. 35(1) of the said Act. On March 14, 1964, one of these trucks was damaged in an accident and on April 4 in the same year the other was seriously damaged if not totally destroyed by fire.\nThe appellant filed proofs of loss with the Saskatchewan Government Insurance Office in due form and time and the respondent stands ready and willing to pay for the damage to each vehicle (less the statutory deductible sum of $150) when the amount payable is finally determined. In respect of the accident claim, the Insurance Office disputes certain items contained in the proof of loss as not constituting \"direct and accidental loss\" within the meaning of s. 35(1) of the Act, and the appraisal in respect of the fire loss for which provision is made under s. 36(9) has not been completed.\nThe appellant, however, makes no claim in this action in respect of the direct damage sustained by either of his vehicles but contends that the failure of the Insurance office to comply with the terms of ss. 36(8) (2) and 36(13) of the Act has resulted in delays which have had the effect of putting him out of business altogether and in this regard he claims in respect of each truck special damages in the amount of $50,000 and general damages of $100,000. The provisions of s. 36(8) (2) read as follows:\nExcept where an appraisal has been had, the insurer, instead of making payment, may within a reasonable time repair, rebuild or replace the property damaged or lost with other of like kind and quality, giving written notice of its intention so to do within seven days after receipt of the proofs of loss; but there can be no abandonment of the vehicle to the insurer without its consent. In the event of the insurer exercising such option, the salvage, if any, shall revert to it.\nThe appellant, who appeared in person before this Court, strongly argued that failure by the insurer to give the notice for which provision is made in this section constituted a breach of the statute. This contention is based on a misconstruction of the meaning of the language used in the section which only requires notice to be given in a case where the insurer intends to \"repair, rebuild or replace the property damaged\". In the present cases the insurer had no such intention and the provision for notice is accordingly inapplicable. It follows that in so far as the appellant's claims are based on a breach of this section they must fail.\nSection 36(13) upon the breach of which the appellant's claims are also based, reads as follows:\nThe insurer shall pay any insurance money for which it is liable within sixty days after the proof of loss has been received by it, or, where an appraisal is had under statutory condition 9, within fifteen days after the award is rendered.\nAs no award had yet been rendered in respect of the fire loss, the provisions of this section can have no relevance to that claim.\nAs has been indicated, the Insurance Office disputed certain items in the proof of loss filed in respect of the accident claim and no money was paid within sixty days after it had been received, but the liability of the Insurance Office is limited and controlled by the provisions of the Act and the only insurance for which provision is made in the \"owner's certificate\" referred to in s. 35(1) is insurance \"against direct and accidental loss of or damage to the vehicle designated therein\u2026\". It is thus apparent that the insurer under such a certificate is not responsible for consequential loss or damage such as that claimed by the appellant in the present case. It is to be observed also that under the provisions of s. 36(8) (1) of the Act, it is provided that the insurer's liability \"\u2026 shall in no event exceed what it would cost to repair or replace the vehicle\u2026\"\nThis appeal is accordingly dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitor for the defendant, respondent: J. Green, Regina.\n"}

The latter wanted some exploratory work done on these claims and gave instructions to the plaintiff company to do this work. All that McT had to do was to take readings from a magnetometer and record them in a log book. The results, when plotted and recorded, established that a mineralized zone on the claims ran in a southwesterly or northeasterly direction and indicated that the area north and east of the claims contained an extension of the mineralized zone. This was ground that the company would have staked for M in the normal course of events. While McT did not see the final plot and record of the readings, he could tell from the showings and the magnetometer work that he did that the area north and east of the claims was on the strike of the mineralized zone. He made up his mind to stake this area for himself. After having turned over his log book containing the record of the magnetometer readings and having later severed his employment, McT staked a number of claims north and easterly of and contiguous to M's claims.\nIn an action brought to compel McT to transfer the claims which he had staked around the first group, the trial judge held that McT held these claims as trustee and that he must transfer them to the owner of the other claims. The Court of Appeal, with one member of the Court dissenting, allowed the appeal and held that McT was free to stake these claims for his own benefit. An appeal was then brought to this Court. Held: The appeal should be allowed and the judgment at trial restored.\nThe information acquired by McT during the course of his employment was highly confidential and the purpose for which it was being sought was obvious-the acquisition of other connected claims which would be of advantage to the existing claims. Neither the company nor McT, its servant, could acquire these connected claims against the interest of M. It was a term of his employment, which McT on the facts of the case understood, that he could not use this information for his own advantage. A constructive trust was imposed in a case of this kind because of the mere use of confidential information for private advantage against the interest of the person who made the acquisition of the information possible.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[1] , allowing an appeal from a judgment of Hall C.J.Q.B. (as he then was). Appeal allowed.\nL. N. Hyman and M. A. Kuziak, for the plaintiffs, appellants.\nE. C. Leslie, Q.C., and John Stein, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014This action was brought to compel Donald McTavish, who had been employed on the inspection of certain mining claims, to transfer other mining claims which he staked around the first group after he had severed his employment. The information which led him to stake these claims was acquired in the course of his employment. The learned trial judge held that McTavish held these claims as trustee and that he must transfer them to the owner of the other claims. The Court of Appeal[2] , with Hall J.A. dissenting, allowed the appeal and held that McTavish was free to stake these claims for his own benefit.\nThe facts are that one Maurice Murtack had staked fifteen claims near Brabant Lake in the Rottenstone Mining District of Saskatchewan. These claims were known as Peg 1 to 15. Murtack wanted some exploratory work done and on December 8, 1956, he gave Pre-Cam Exploration & Development Ltd., instructions to do this work in the following letter: Prince Albert, Saskatchewan\nDecember 8, 1956.\nMr. Berry Richards,\nPre-Cam Exploration Ltd.,\nPrince Albert, Saskatchewan\nDear Sirs:\nI have completed the staking of 15 mineral claims in the Rottenstone Mining District near Brabant Lake named Peg 1 to 15, which I am having recorded in my name for myself and associates.\nIt is our wish to have your firm carry on exploratory work on the showings which I have described to you, details of which we will be discussing as work proceeds. The map which I have left with you shows location, etc., of the claims. As an immediate step, I suggest that you proceed with Magnetometer work on the claims and that you follow up any anomalous conditions that may be found to extend from this block of 15 claims in any direction and that you stake the ground on which these extensions may appear for myself and my associates.\nPlease keep me advised of progress in this work.\nYours truly,\n(sgd.) M. Murtack\nAt that date Donald McTavish was an employee of Pre-Cam at a salary of $275 per month. He had had some instruction from Pre-Cam in the operation of a magnetometer and on December 5 the company had him flown to Brabant Lake along with a helper.\nThere had been some development done on the Peg claims. The mineralized zone had been exposed in five places by blasting, making a discovery trench of 60 feet long, with four additional trenches 100 feet apart, each of which exposed mineralized rock. Material from these trenches had been assayed and found promising. There was no overburden in the area of the trenches but the surrounding areas were covered by muskeg. In preparation for the magnetometer work, the brush had been cut along a base line with nine cross lines at right angles. All that McTavish had to do was to take readings from the magnetometer and record them.\nThese readings were taken along the base line and cross lines at 100 foot intervals. The results were entered in a log book. When plotted and recorded these established that a mineralized zone on the Peg claims ran in a southwesterly or northeasterly direction and indicated that the area north and east of the Peg claims contained an extension of the mineralized zone. This was ground that Pre-Cam would have staked for Murtack in the normal course of events. While McTavish did not see the final plot and record of the readings, he could tell from the showings and the magnetometer work that he did that the area north and east of the Peg claims was on the strike of the mineralized zone. He made up his mind to stake this area for himself. There is evidence that he disclosed this intention to at least two men before he returned home for Christmas.\nMcTavish got out by plane on December 23 and turned over his log book containing the record of the magnetometer readings. He then proceeded home to Weyburn for Christmas. Here he interested two men, Thompson and Laing, in the prospects of the Brabant Lake area and pursuant to an agreement made with them, he returned on December 27 to Brabant Lake. On the way and on December 27, he called at the offices of Pre-Cam in Regina, collected his pay and resigned. He staked 20 claims north and easterly of and contiguous to the Peg claims and called them Betty 1, 2, 3 and 8 to 24 inclusive. He was back in Weyburn by January 10,1957.\nThe present case was instituted by Pre-Cam asking for a declaration that McTavish held the Betty claims in trust for Pre-Cam and for an order that he transfer them. The trial came on in 1958 and was adjourned to allow Pre-Cam to amend its Prayer for Relief and to join Murtack as plaintiff. The trial was resumed in November 1958 with Murtack joined and requesting relief for Pre-Cam as trustee for himself. Donald J. Sheridan, the Chief Mining Recorder, was joined as Defendant, only that he might have notice of proceedings.\nThe conclusions of the learned Chief Justice at trial are summarized in the following extracts from his reasons for judgment:\nMcTavish fully appreciated the significance of the readings he had made and recorded and that the area Northeasterly of the Peg claims might well contain valuable mineralized deposits along the strike of the zone exposed in the Peg claims. While still on the job on the Peg claims, he decided to stake the area Northeast of the Peg claims for himself. I accept the evidence of Slater including his testimony that on or about December 16th, McTavish showed him a rough sketch of some 14 claims Northeast of the Peg claims and contiguous thereto, which McTavish said he was going to come back and stake for himself.\nThe really essential thing that McTavish learned while doing the magnetometer survey work on the Peg claims besides what he saw in the discovery trenches was that the strike of this promising mineralized zone ran in a Northeasterly direction. He admitted in cross examination, that it was as a result of what he learned while working for Pre-Cam on the Peg claims that he decided to stake for himself the area that is now Betty 1, 2, 3 and 8 to 24 inclusive. He did no work on what is now the Betty group while working on the Peg claims, nor did he use any of the plaintiff's instruments outside the Peg limits.\nWithout the information acquired during the course of his employment, McTavish would not have staked the adjoining claims. This was highly confidential information and the purpose for which it was being sought was obvious\u2014the acquisition of other connected claims which would be of advantage to the existing claims. Neither Pre-Cam nor McTavish, its servant, could acquire these connected claims against the interest of Murtack. Contrary to the majority opinion in the Court of Appeal, I think that it was a term of his employment, which McTavish on the facts of this case understood, that he could not use this information for his own advantage. The use of the term \"fraud\" by the learned Chief Justice at trial was fully warranted. The severance of his employment on December 27 was an empty formality which could not improve his position. I do not mean by this that a simple-minded person with his own ideas of common honesty could do this sort of thing without having to answer. The constructive trust is imposed in a case of this kind because of the mere use of confidential information for private advantage against the interest of the person who made the acquisition of the information possible.\nI would allow the appeal with costs, both here and in the Court of Appeal, and restore the judgment at trial.\nAppeal allowed with costs and judgment at trial restored.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, appellants: Pearce, Hyman & Kuziak, Regina.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: MacPherson, Leslie and Tyerman, Regina.\n[1] (1965), 53 W.W.R. 662.\n[2] (1965), 53 W.W.R. 662.\n"}

She sought possession of the land from the appellant who was in occupation thereof, and who had refused to surrender the same. The appellant, by her defence, claimed the right of possession of the land, and counterclaimed against both the plaintiff and W for a declaration that she was entitled to the property rights of a wife therein by virtue of an agreement between herself and W. In the alternative she claimed compensation, on a quantum meruit basis, for housekeeping services performed by her for W.\nInitially, the appellant had gone to live with W believing that he was a widower, and that he intended to marry her, although he told her that he was not then ready to marry. After learning that he was not a widower, but a married man, she left him for a brief period, and then returned. There was then talk of a divorce, but again W said he would divorce his wife \"when I will be ready\". When they first lived together and also after her departure and return, W told the appellant that the land would be hers. W made a will in the appellant's favour but this will was later revoked by a will in favour of his daughter and, prior to his death, W transferred the land to his daughter, who became registered as owner.\nThe trial judge found that there was an agreement between the appellant and W whereby the latter agreed to give her the land and the household contents to induce her to continue their relationship after she discovered that he was still married. He gave judgment vesting the land in the appellant. On the appeal to the Court of Appeal, the finding of the existence of an agreement was apparently not challenged. The appeal was allowed on the grounds that such an agreement was based upon an immoral consideration, i.e., illicit cohabitation, and was, therefore, void, being contrary to public policy. From that decision the appellant appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed. The evidence failed to establish an intention on the part of the parties to enter into a binding legal contract whereby the appellant would live and look after W in consideration of his agreement to transfer the land to her, or to pay her some unascertained sum by way of compensation for her services. On the contrary, the true situation was that the appellant was content to accept the lodging provided by W, and to live with him as his wife, in the hope that some day he would marry her and that some day he would give her the land.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, allowing an appeal from a judgment of Hall J. Appeal dismissed.\nSidney Green, for the appellant.\nG. O. Jewers, for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014The proceedings in this case were commenced by Rose Borowsky, the daughter of Nicholas Wachniuk, by virtue of her being the registered owner of certain lands and premises in the City of Winnipeg, municipally known as 756 Mountain Avenue, hereinafter sometimes referred to as \"the land\", which had been transferred to her by her father. She sought possession of the land from the appellant who was in occupation thereof, and who had refused to surrender the same.\nThe appellant, by her defence, claimed the right of possession of the land, and counterclaimed against both the plaintiff and Wachniuk for a declaration that she was entitled to the property rights of a wife therein by virtue of an agreement between herself and Wachniuk. In the alternative she claimed compensation, on a quantum meruit basis, for housekeeping services performed by her for Wachniuk.\nBoth Wachniuk and Rose Borowsky died after the proceedings were commenced and prior to the trial. The respondent is the administrator of the estates of both of them.\nThe only evidence at trial of any importance was that of the appellant, which was accepted by the learned trial judge. She stated that she had met Wachniuk in August, 1960, at an auction sale. At that time she was a widow, and was living with her daughter and the daughter's family. She was then 65 years of age. Her only income was the widow's allowance and she paid her daughter $20 a month for her room and board. Wachniuk was then over 70 years of age.\nThe appellant says that she told him she was a widow and that he told her he was a widower and that he wanted to get married. He said that he wanted her for his wife.\nShe was then asked the following questions and gave the following answers:\nQ. Did he tell you what this would involve, what you would have to do?\nA. That he would have a wife for his house.\nQ. Did he say anything about his house?\nA. He said it will be mine.\nQ. What happened as a result of this meeting?\nA. He said to get married he wasn't ready then.\nThe appellant went to live with Wachniuk on September 1, 1960. When asked whether there was any discussion of marriage, she said he kept speaking continuously about that, that he said they would get married, but \"he wasn't ready yet\u201d.\nAbout a month later, the appellant learned that Wachniuk was still a married man, his wife being still alive. She says that after she learned of this \"He said I am unable to marry, but everything is yours.\"\nAt some time after the appellant learned that Wachniuk was not free to marry her, and, according to her evidence, because of this, she left Wachniuk and returned to her daughter's house for a period which she estimated, in direct evidence, as three days, and, on cross-examination, as three weeks. However, at his request, she returned to him. The evidence does not disclose that, at this time, he made any new promise regarding the land in order to induce her to return to him. He did tell her that he was going to divorce his wife \"When he will be ready.\"\nLater Wachniuk fell ill, and the appellant says that she looked after him until, on May 5, 1963, he went to hospital on his doctor's orders. On his release from hospital, on May 17, he went to live with his daughter, Rose Borowsky. He went back to hospital on August 22 and died on November 20,1963.\nOn February 14, 1963, Wachniuk made a will which, after devising certain property, other than the land, to his daughter, left the residue of his estate to the appellant. Her evidence as to this is as follows:\nQ. Did you talk to Mr. Wachniuk about your rights?\nA. Yes, I was speaking.\nQ. What was said?\nA. I told him and he said, \"Don't worry about it. Where you are you will remain there.\"\nQ. Did he do anything?\nA. Yes, he did.\nQ. What did he do?\nA. He made a Will.\nQ. How did this come about?\nA. He said, \"if you are not certain with me I will make you a Will.\"\nQ. What did he do?\nA. I went and he made me a Will.\nThis will was later revoked by a will in favour of his daughter and, prior to his death, Wachniuk had transferred the land to his daughter, who became registered as owner.\nThe foregoing is a summary of the appellant's evidence respecting her rights to the land. The learned trial judge found there was an agreement between the appellant and Wachniuk whereby the latter agreed to give her the land and the household contents to induce her to continue their relationship after she discovered that he was still married. He gave judgment vesting the land in the appellant.\nApparently the finding of the existence of an agreement was not challenged on the appeal to the Court of Appeal. The appeal was allowed on the grounds that such an agreement was based upon an immoral consideration, i.e., illicit cohabitation, and was, therefore, void, being contrary to public policy.\nFrom that decision the appellant appealed to this Court.\nI have carefully examined the appellant's evidence. In my opinion, even if it is accepted completely, as it was by the learned trial judge, it fails to establish the making of a legal contract which would entitle the appellant either to obtain title to the land, or compensation on a quantum meruit basis.\nThe evidence is that, initially, the appellant went to live with Wachniuk believing that he was a widower, and that he intended to marry her, although he told her that he was not then ready to marry. After learning that he was not a widower, but a married man, she left him for a brief period, and then returned. There was then talk of a divorce, but again Wachniuk said he would divorce his wife \"when I will be ready\".\nThe appellant was apparently content to live with Wachniuk on the basis of these rather vague assurances as to his intent, some time in the future, to marry her.\nI have already referred to the appellant's evidence respecting the land. When they first lived together, and Wachniuk told her he wanted her for his wife, he said to her that \"it will be mine\". After her departure and return \"He said I am unable to marry but everything is yours.\" There is some evidence of other like statements. They amount to nothing more than an expression as to future intent, and the appellant was content to live with Wachniuk without anything further.\nWachniuk did get as far as making a will in the appellant's favour, which does establish that, at the time he made it, he did intend that the appellant should have the land after his death. Later he apparently changed his mind and this will was revoked.\nIn my opinion all of this evidence fails to establish an intention on the part of the parties to enter into a binding legal contract whereby the appellant would live with and look after Wachniuk in consideration of his agreement to transfer the land to her, or to pay her some unascertained sum by way of compensation for her services. On the contrary, the true situation was that the appellant was content to accept the lodging provided by Wachniuk, and to live with him as his wife, in the hope that some day he would marry her and that some day he would give her the land. We do not know what Wachniuk's intent was, as his death prevented his giving evidence. But on the appellant's own evidence I do not find that any of his statements to her were anything more than expressions of intent. They were not made in contemplation of legal consequences in the form of a binding contract. In view of this conclusion it is unnecessary to consider the question as to whether a contract of the kind alleged by the appellant would be void as against public policy.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Mitchell, Green and Minuk, Winnipeg.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Fillmore, Riley & Co., Winnipeg.\n"}

Lepine, [1966] S.C.R. 561\nDate: 1966-06-28\nThe University Hospital Board (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nGerald Lepine (Plaintiff) Respondent.\nGeorge Monckton (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nGerald Lepine (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1966: May 17, 18; 1966: June 28.\nPresent: Abbott, Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Hall JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA, APPELLATE DIVISION\nHospitals\u2014Physicians and surgeons\u2014Negligence\u2014Epileptic patient leaping through window of fourth floor ward\u2014Injuries result of impulse which could not reasonably have been foreseen\u2014Actions against hospital and doctor dismissed.\nThe plaintiff who suffered from a form of epilepsy known as automatism was admitted to the defendant hospital, where he was placed in a ward on the fourth floor. This procedure was followed because he was a patient of the defendant doctor and this was the medical ward which the doctor used for his patients. While in the hospital the plaintiff suffered a number of epileptic seizures, the majority of which were automatisms. He was not given continuous supervisory care and at times would wander out of his room during a seizure. One morning, after having been found wandering on a street some distance from the hospital and after having been returned to his ward by three police officers and an orderly, the plaintiff asked if he could go to the washroom which was located inside the ward room. On emerging from the washroom, he was walking towards his bed when he suddenly jumped up on to a chair and leaped through the window and as a result received serious injuries. The defendant doctor, a nurse and the three police officers were in the ward when the plaintiff made his unfortunate leap.\nTwo actions claiming damages as a result of the injuries that he sustained were commenced by the plaintiff against the hospital and the doctor. The trial judge dismissed the action against the doctor and allowed the claim against the hospital. On appeal, the Appellate Division unanimously dismissed the hospital's appeal and allowed the plaintiff's appeal, one member of the Court dissenting, against the doctor and as required by The Contributory Negligence Act of Alberta determined that each of the defendants was at fault to the extent of 50 per cent. The defendants then appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the actions dismissed.\nWhether or not an act or omission is negligent must be judged not by its consequences alone but also by considering whether a reasonable person should have anticipated that what happened might be a natural result of that act or omission. Glasgow Corporation v. Muir, [1943] A.C. 448, referred to.\nThe plaintiff's sudden leap through the window was not an event which a reasonable man would have foreseen and have been required to take more precautions than were available in this case. Short of having put the plaintiff in some restraining device or of keeping him at ground level, both of which were rejected by the Appellate Division as being necessary or required, the injuries sustained by the plaintiff were the result of an impulse on his part which could not reasonably have been foreseen.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division[1] , dismissing an appeal by the appellant hospital and allowing an appeal by the respondent from the respective trial judgments in two actions heard together by Farthing J. Appeal allowed and the actions dismissed.\nC. W. Clement, Q.C., for the defendant, appellant, University Hospital Board.\nW. A. McGillivray, Q.C., for the defendant, appellant, Monckton.\nA. G. Macdonald, Q.C., for the plaintiff, respondent, Lepine.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nHALL J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[2] in which two appeals from two judgments of Farthing J. were heard together. Two actions were commenced by the respondent Lepine against The University Hospital Board and Dr. Monckton claiming damages as a result of injuries sustained by the respondent on July 24, 1962. These two actions were tried together, and at the conclusion of the trial Farthing J., in an oral judgment, dismissed the action against Dr. Monckton. Later he handed down a written judgment dated December 16, 1964, awarding Lepine damages in the sum of $46,689.50 and other relief against the hospital.\nThe main facts are not in dispute. They were set out at length in the judgment of the learned trial judge and by Cairns J.A. in his reasons for judgment on the appeal.\nThe respondent who was 26 years of age at the time of the trial was an Indian residing at Hay River in the Northwest Territories where he was employed as janitor of the public school there. To quote Farthing J.:\nFrom the age of thirteen plaintiff has been suffering from epilepsy which had been kept under control by medication so that it had interfered with his performing his duties to a negligible degree. He was a co-operative patient and conformed to the rules prescribed by his doctors so faithfully that, despite his troublesome and trying disease, he led an active and useful life. In the summer of 1961 he had come to Edmonton, on the advice of his physician in Hay River, to be examined and treated by Dr. Monckton, a neurologist. In the following summer he came to Edmonton again for the same purpose, arriving on Tuesday, 10th July. At first he stayed with relatives or friends, as a holiday, apparently.\nThe two most important rules laid down for his guidance with which, apparently, he almost invariably complied, were to abstain completely from any alcoholic beverage and to take prescribed medication several times a day. During his first few days in Edmonton he departed from his rule of total abstinence and took a few glasses of beer sometimes. On the evidence I am satisfied that he drank nothing except beer and the quantity he took would not, for a person in normal health, be in any way excessive. But, of course, as a victim of epilepsy, he should not have taken any beer at all. However, I am satisfied that he drank none after Friday 13th July.\nMoreover, his supply of medicine ran out on Monday 16th July. He testified that he did not think it would do him any harm to be without it for a day, as he expected to see Dr. Monckton on the 17th.\nOn the evidence I am satisfied that the events of 24th July were not in any way or in any degree attributable to beer or lack of his customary medication.\nPlaintiff suffered from a form of epilepsy known in medical parlance as automatism. The great majority of those suffering from that disease do not move about when having epileptic seizures. A minority, estimated, according to the evidence, at not more than twenty per cent, move, under seizure, from place to place sometimes at considerable danger to themselves or even others. Such patients are in no way responsible for their actions, while so moving about, of which they are quite oblivious.\nThe respondent had come to Edmonton in 1961 to consult Dr. Monckton to whom he had been referred by his own physician, Dr. Norman Douglas Abbey, of Hay River. Dr. Monckton was a neurologist. The treatment of epilepsy was part of Dr. Monckton's specialty as a neurologist. Dr. Monckton saw the respondent in the summer of 1961. He reported to Dr. Abbey on August 4, 1961, in part:\nPhysical examination showed no significant abnormality, excepting for some right facial asymmetry. I thought that an electroencephalogram ought to be done here and I am arranging for this to be carried out and I took the liberty of increasing his medication by the addition of Mysoline grams 025 b. i. d.\nAs soon as the E. E. G. is back I will, of course, let you know its result.\nand again on August 14 as follows:\nDear Doctor Abbey:\nRe: Mr. Gerald LEPINE\u2014Age 24 years.\nFurther to my letter of August 4th, Mr. LePine's electroencephalogram is now to hand and does show quite a well developed right fronto-temporal, sharp wave, focal abnormality. This is seen against a background of a fair amount of slow delta activity in the same region. This clearly must indicate some structural abnormality of an epilepto-genic nature which, I would think, is probably a birth injury or something of that kind. It does, I think, in the long run, warrant further investigation by air studies and perhaps angiography at some more convenient time since Mr. LePine, as you know, is just finishing his holidays and is very anxious to get back home. I have, however, increased his medication to Mysoline grams 025, b. i. d., together with his Dilantin and Phenobarbital. If this should be inadequate, it might be worth increasing the Mysoline a further dose to three times daily. If the attacks are still persistent, then I feel he should come down for a more prolonged stay so that we can study him in hospital. I hope this will meet with your approval.\nLepine returned to Hay River. In July 1962, he returned to Edmonton to see Dr. Monckton. He arrived in Edmonton on July 10. As stated by Farthing J., Lepine stayed with relatives or friends until he moved into the King Edward Hotel on July 16. Meanwhile, he had consumed some beer and ran out of his supply of medicine. Farthing J. found that whatever beer he had consumed did not in any degree contribute to what happened on July 24. The medical evidence supports this finding.\nAs stated, Lepine moved into the King Edward Hotel on July 16. Shortly after midnight Mr. W. Pitt, a security officer on the staff of the hotel, found respondent on the roof thereof where he had gone while under a seizure. He sent for the police and stayed and talked with respondent on the roof until they arrived. After talking to Lepine, the police recognized that he was an epileptic and had had a seizure and they told Pitt of his condition and that he now appeared to be all right. He was returned to his room. Pitt kept him under observation and about 3:00 a.m., when he had another seizure, the police were sent for again. This time they took him in an ambulance to the Royal Alexandra Hospital where he was given medicine and then returned to the King Edward Hotel. Before long, he had another attack and the police were called a third time. Meanwhile they had learned that Lepine's Edmonton physician was Dr. Monckton who told them to take him to the University Hospital. He arrived there by ambulance about 4:45 a.m. on July 17. During his second seizure at the King Edward, Lepine left his room and headed towards the fire escape. Mr. Pitt put himself between Lepine and the fire escape door and persuaded Lepine to return to his room, and once in the room Mr. Pitt says Lepine tried to go to the window but he had him sit on the bed and he stayed there until the police came and took him away in the ambulance. The information as to heading for the fire escape and trying \"to go for the window\" was not com-municated to the hospital or to Dr. Monckton.\nOn arrival at the hospital, he was admitted and placed in Room 402 which was on the fourth floor. This procedure was followed because he was a patient of Dr. Monckton and this was the medical ward which Dr. Monckton used for his patients. He remained a patient in the hospital from the morning of July 17 until the forenoon of July 24 when the events which gave rise to this action took place. During the period from the 17th to the 23rd, Lepine was kept in Room 402 which was a medical ward along with several other patients and he received the supervision that the other patients in the same ward were given except that on two occasions he was moved to a room near the nurses' station where more supervision could be given. The second of these occasions was on the morning of July 24 with which I will deal separately. During this period, and including the morning of the 24th, Lepine suffered about 28 epileptic seizures which were noted by the nurses and he had other seizures not noted by the nurses but mentioned by the witness Hertel who was a patient in the same room. Of these seizures about 8 or 9 were grand mal and some 17 automatisms. He would at times wander out of his room and once went as far as the X-ray room which was some distance from Room 402. In the early morning of the 24th, Lepine became difficult and noisy. The night supervisor, on becoming aware of this, assigned Nurse Collins to supervise Lepine and she remained with him until 7:30 a.m. that morning and to facilitate the supervision Lepine was taken from Room 402 to a room adjoining the nurses' station. He had a seizure there and climbed over the side rail of his bed. He had another seizure about six o'clock in the morning and his speech was incoherent. This was reported to Dr. Shea by the charge nurse who had been advised of the situation by Nurse Collins, and this doctor prescribed sedation which was given about six in the morning. Later, around seven o'clock, Lepine was up in bed and appeared unaware of what he was doing. His speech was rapid and he was making odd movements and used the expression \"That is the man\". It was quite obvious that something was troubling him at this time. Nurse Collins appeared concerned with his actions, because on the chart which she made out on leaving she noted the words \"psychiatric assistance?\". When Nurse Collins left, no other special nurse was put on, to replace her nor was an orderly detailed to attend the patient. Dr. Shea visited Lepine about 8:00 o'clock that morning. He read the entries made by the nurse prior to his visit and so was aware of what had transpired during the night, including the entry \"psychiatric assistance?\" made at about 7:10 a.m. Dr. Shea who, at the time in question, was associate resident in the Department of Medicine attached to the service of neurology had seen and examined Lepine several times in the period from July 17 until July 24, and dealing with the morning of the 24th he testified:\nQ. And, why on the morning of the 24th was he on vital signs?\nA. I placed him on vital signs being notified of this fall because of any possibility of injury having occurred to his head so that if anything were going wrong this would quickly become evident.\nQ. And, what sedation did you order by telephone?\nA. Mr. Lepine had been placed on oral dilantin in the regular dose for a person of his age and weight. In addition to this, in an instance such as this, however, it was felt prudent to increase the amount of dilantin he was given with one what we call a stat dose. This is a boost over and above the level that would be circulating in his system and in addition to this he was given a barbiturate which we term sodium amytal, s-o-d-i-u-m a-m-y-t-a-l. The amount was two to three grains, I would honestly have to refer to the order sheet for the actual amount. These were given in the form of an intermuscular injection.\nQ. Now, when did you next see Lepine? A. I next saw Mr. Lepine on my way to the neurology clinic and the hour that I recorded or at least that is recorded in the nurses' notes is in the vicinity of eight fifteen.\nQ. And, prior to seeing Lepine did you have an opportunity to see the notes? The nurses' notes?\nA. Yes, I did, sir.\nQ. So, you were aware of their contents?\nA. That is correct.\nQ. Where was Mr. Lepine at that time?\nA. Mr. Lepine was in his bed, in his usual ward.\nQ. That would be 402?\nA. 402.\nQ. And, what was his condition?\nA. A nurse was in company with me, we approached his bed, I recall asking him pertaining to the events of the previous night for which he had no recollection. His responses to me at that time seemed quite normal. He was clear, he was lucid, his replies were in context with the questions and in general he was much as the Court saw him in the stand the other day.\nQ. And, at the time you saw him at eight fifteen he seemed to have no trouble from his epilepsy or any of the aftereffects?\nA. None.\nQ. When you saw him where was he, was he in bed or in a chair?\nA. As I recall he was sitting on his bed with his legs dangling over the side.\nMr. Lepine had been brought back to Room 402 at 7:45 a.m. on the 24th and he remained there until approximately 9:05 when the nurse on duty left the room to look at his chart, and on her return about 9:15 she discovered that the patient had gone.\nLepine was found by three police officers at about 9:51 a.m., wandering at Saskatchewan Drive and 116th Street, Edmonton, dressed in a housecoat, pajamas and socks with no shoes. He told the police \"The nuts in the hospital have a bomb\". He did not appear to know what was going on. He was taken to the hospital by the three police officers who had found him, entering through the emergency entrance. They reported to the person in charge there and were asked to wait until an orderly was summoned to take Lepine back to his room. An orderly arrived and was about to escort Lepine and the officers to Room 402 when he ran out the main door, knocking over a little girl who was coming into the hospital at the time. The police officers and the orderly followed him and they caught up to him when he fell. The evidence is clear that he was particularly violent and mentally unbalanced at this time. He told the police to go ahead and shoot him, that he had nothing left. The hospital orderly was there and saw what had occurred. Lepine was taken back into the hospital by the orderly and the three police officers and taken to Room 402. Staff Sergeant Robertson, who was one of the police officers who brought Lepine back to the hospital, testifying for Lepine, described the events immediately preceding the accident as follows:\nWe went up to Room 402 and Lepine's bed was there and it was located near the window of the room that would be against the east wall.\nHe walked over there, sat down on a chair near his bed, asked if he could put on his shoes. We had no objection, he seemed quite calm then.\nHe then asked if he could go to the washroom which is located right inside the ward room itself; he was allowed to go there but Ostapowich and myself remained at the door while Sergeant Strate lingered near the window of the room.\nThere were two other bed patients in the room. I believe the orderly had gone to get a nurse and the nurse in turn had gone to get a doctor to come to attend to Mr. Lepine.\nThe nurse was a Miss Wallace if I recall correctly. Just before Mr. Lepine came out of the washroom Dr. George Monckton came in with Miss Wallace. Lepine then came, out of the washroom and he sort of had a half grin on his face. The doctor asked\u2014said words to the effect, hello Gerald how are you feeling, and to my recollection Lepine answered, just fine doctor, and started walking towards his bed.\nNear the\u2014right against the windowsill was a chair. As Lepine started walking towards his bed he suddenly took two steps, leaped up on the chair and just dove right out through the window of the fourth floor.\nIt is for the injuries then and there sustained that the actions against the hospital and Dr. Monckton were brought. Negligence was alleged against Dr. Monckton as follows:\n(a) in failing to have the Plaintiff kept and treated in Station 14, an area of the said hospital especially designed for treatment of such patients with unbreakable windows and located on the lower floor of the said hospital;\n(b) in failing to cause the Plaintiff to be restrained;\n(c) in failing to advise the aforesaid police officers that in his condition the Plaintiff was dangerous to himself and others;\n(d) in failing to keep the patient on the ground floor of the said hospital until he had recovered his reason;\n(e) in failing to recognize that the Plaintiff was obsessed by the idea of escaping from the said hospital and that he might cause himself injury in attempting so to do and in failing to take any or any adequate precautions to prevent such injury;\n(f) in failing to see that both the windows and doors of the said public ward were guarded after the Plaintiff was placed in the said ward; (g) in failing to administer a drug which would render the Plaintiff immobile;\n(h) in holding himself out to provide care and treatment to members of the public and holding himself out to provide proper care and treatment for members of the public and in failing to provide the care and treatment necessary for the Plaintiff;\n(i) in failing to issue instructions to the staff and persons in charge employed by the said hospital as to the proper requirements for the care and treatment of the Plaintiff and more especially the precautions to be taken with the Plaintiff when the Plaintiff was suffering from an epileptic seizure;\n(j) in failing to provide the medication and care necessary for the Plaintiff in the circumstances and more especially in failing to warn the hospital staff that would be dealing with the Plaintiff on his return to the hospital after the Plaintiff had left the hospital herein set forth;\nAllegations (a) to (g) above were made against the hospital with four additional allegations as follows:\n(h) in operating a hospital to which Plaintiff and other members of the public were invited for care and treatment and in failing to provide the care and treatment necessary for the Plaintiff;\n(i) in failing to issue or to enforce regulations or give proper instructions to the hospital staff of the Defendant for the care and treatment of patients in the Plaintiff's condition and in failing to take such steps as were necessary for the protection of patients such as the Plaintiff who required care beyond that offered ordinary patients in that they could injure themselves, or alternatively, if such instruction was given and regulations were promulgated they were not followed or were neglected in the case of the Plaintiff;\n(j) in taking or directing the Plaintiff to be taken to a ward on the fourth floor of the hospital;\n(k) generally in failing to appreciate the probable consequences of Plaintiff's conduct and illness and to take proper or any steps for his safety when they ought to have done so.\nIn dismissing the action against Dr. Monckton, the learned trial judge, Farthing J., said:\nMy own view is that as far as Dr. Monckton is concerned\u2014and I am expressing no opinion about the Hospital Board as yet so don't please anticipate what I might say\u2014so far as Dr. Monckton is concerned the plaintiff has singularly failed to establish a cause of action. I can't see any possible basis of claim against Dr. Monckton. I don't think that he has been guilty of anything except possibly, at the very most an error of judgment and that in itself is no cause of action and I doubt very much even if that were the test that the plaintiff would have succeeded in establishing a case against him. The doctor obviously, a physician and surgeon and especially a man of eminence in his own branch of the profession, can't devote his whole time to any one patient and it seems to me that there is no evidence of any negligence on the part of Dr. Monckton throughout this whole matter. He certainly was not responsible for anything that occurred on the morning of the 24th of July, though he did happen to be in the room when, apparently when the unfortunate jump took place. In the action against the hospital, Farthing J. said:\nIn the instant case the present plaintiff was in the hospital precisely because he was suffering from epilepsy with post\u2014epileptic automatism and his tendency to irresponsible moving about was well known to all concerned.\nCounsel for defendant stressed very strongly the statement of the Judicial Committee in Vancouver General Hospital us. McDaniel[3] , expressed tritely in the judgment: \"A defendant charged with negligence can clear his feet if he shows that he has acted in accord with general and approved practice.\"\nThere is evidence as to the present customary treatment of ordinary epileptics. There is little or no definite or specific evidence concerning the modern treatment of those epileptics\u2014not more than one in five of them\u2014afflicted with automatism. This repeated reference through the evidence presented on behalf of the defendant to \"epilepsy\" and \"epileptics\" per se only, in my view, served to emphasize the fundamental basis of this action, i.e. that defendant treated plaintiff as it would have treated any other epileptic, quite overlooking the totally different and much more dangerous implications of his automatism.\nMoreover, for patients to jump out of hospital windows while extremely rare is not unknown, as the foregoing instances, show. Whatever may be the established practice in Canada and the United States regarding certain contagious diseases, it certainly does not seem to be true that the established practice in the United States is to refuse damages to every person who, because of mental upset, temporary or permanent, has jumped through a hospital window; and with genuine respect to a very strong court in Saskatchewan[4] I venture the opinion that there have not yet been sufficient Canadian decisions to establish such practice in Canada.\nLike so many other people I am personally under a great debt of gratitude to the medical profession and to some hospitals, which I will never forget. But if those in charge of hospitals\u2014who are not solely physicians and surgeons\u2014can escape liability for negligence simply on the plea that they have complied with the established practice, they can, in effect, in the course of time create enough customs to provide a good defence against almost any claim for damages for personal injuries.\nIt is now thirty years since the Privy Council delivered its judgment in Vancouver General Hospital us. McDaniel, supra. From the quotations, supra, from Lord Denning M.R. and Lord Nathan, it would seem that in much more recent years it has been reiterated in definite terms that in England common law based on custom will continue to be declared by the courts.\nIn my humble but convinced opinion, after many hours of considering with my utmost care the evidence in this somewhat lengthy trial, the misfortune which befell the plaintiff resulted from the fact that, though the defendant from the start had definite knowledge of his tendency to dangerous post-epileptic automatism, it placed him in the category of an ordinary epileptic. The only persons in the hospital who seemed to realize the risks attendant upon his particular form of epilepsy were some of the nurses who, on two occasions before the disaster of 24th July, tried to give him the protection his safety required. It is not my responsibility to say just what officials or employees were at fault. The defendant undertook the care of plaintiff who, through no fault of his own, suffered shattering injuries while in such care.\nAll changes are not necessarily improvements to the benefit of all affected by them. Had the armorplated glass not been removed from Station 14 on the ground floor of the hospital and had plaintiff been placed therein, this accident would never have occurred. It is noteworthy that in Dr. Snell's explanation as to why this change was made as given above, he referred to \"psychiatric patients\", not even specifically to epileptics, much less to those afflicted with post-epileptic automatism. This change may have been beneficial to those suffering from ordinary epilepsy. But, with all respect, it would appear obvious to any intelligent high-school student that it was dangerous to automatists. The opinion of Dr. Easton, who knew as much and probably more than any other medical witness about epileptic hospitalization, that, without these safeguards, the only proper course was to keep plaintiff under the care of a competent orderly or nurse at all times, would also seem, to an high-school student to follow in logical sequence.\nIn the light of the evidence and for the above reasons it seems clear to me that plaintiff is entitled to judgment.\nThe hospital appealed the finding of liability so made against it and Lepine appealed the dismissal of the action against Dr. Monckton.\nThe Appellate Division unanimously dismissed the hospital's appeal and allowed the appeal, Cairns J.A. dissenting against Dr. Monckton and as required by The Contributory Negligence Act of Alberta determined that each of the defendants was at fault to the extent of 50 per cent.\nCairns J.A. in his reasons for judgment upheld liability against the hospital, holding that it was the negligence of the hospital on July 24 that caused the damage. He said:\nAfter a careful consideration of all of the evidence in this case, some of which I have quoted, I have come to the conclusion that not only had the condition of Lepine worsened, but he became, as I have already indicated, psychotic on the morning of the 24th of July. This condition was known by Nurse Collins and was known to Dr. Shea, or should have been appreciated because he read the chart that morning before seeing Lepine at about 8 a.m. The evidence of the doctors which I have quoted indicated this change in the patient's condition. It was recognized by the hospital authorities and Nurse Collins was put on duty as a special the morning of the 24th, and did, in fact, supervise him. In my view it was negligent conduct not to continue this or other supervision by orderlies, after she went off duty at 7.30 that morning, because of the condition of the patient. The negligence which caused the plaintiff's damage was continuous from that time, and is not confined to the incident when he jumped out the window. It should have been foreseen or anticipated that a patient in his changed condition might well do damage to himself. The doctors' evidence is clear that a psychotic patient requires constant supervision, and this was not supplied. I think Dr. Easton's opinion and the other evidence can only lead one to the conclusion that if there had been supervision by a trained person, Lepine would not have been allowed to escape from the hospital and run away to Saskatchewan Drive. The traumatic experience of his recapture by the police and his becoming violent, and his fight with the police, made his condition much more acute and I have no doubt had some influence on his later mental state and behavior when he jumped out of the window shortly after being returned to his room. As I have said, I do not think that it is necessary to .decide whether there was negligence before the 24th, because even if there was, it was not actionable. There certainly was negligence and it was continuous, commencing on the 24th. I think also that the hospital authorities were negligent in not having supervision when Lepine was returned to his room, in view of what was known to have occurred that morning and the knowledge of the orderly who saw the fight, and the fact that this could have been reported to the person in charge before he was taken back to his room, or the orderly should have stayed with him in the room. I base my conclusion, as I have stated, on the continuous negligence commencing prior to his being taken to the room.\nJohnson J.A., with whom the Chief Justice of Alberta concurred, found negligence against both Dr. Monckton and the hospital as follows:\nIt is, I think, obvious that the learned trial judge considered the lack of provision for special care for Lepine throughout his stay in the hospital up to the time of the accident to be the principal negligence of the hospital, for he says later in his judgment:\n\"The liability of the present defendant hospital is not to be determined solely by what occurred at the time of the jump but is based throughout upon its persistent refusal to recognize any difference between the care of a patient suffering from severe attacks of automatism and of the vast majority of epileptics who never have such attacks.\"\nIn the argument before us, many suggestions were made as to how the accident could have been prevented. Looking at all the evidence in the light of what happened, certain evidence that no one considered particularly significant at the time, assumed much greater importance after the accident had happened\u2014one fact which comes to mind is Lepine's movement towards the window when he was in the King Edward Hotel on the early morning of July 17th. An approach to the determination of the liability of both the doctor and the hospital which looks at events in the light of what subsequently happened, is not a sound one. Liability must be determined upon the knowledge of the dangers inherent in the condition of Lepine when and after he entered the hospital. What form the accident took is only important when it is necessary to determine if the accident is one which was caused by the failure to take the kind of care which was required, based upon the knowledge which the doctor and the hospital possessed or should have possessed.\nThe learned trial judge's finding that the hospital should have provided special accommodation for epileptics who also suffered from automatism, coupled with the suggestion that such accommodation be on the ground floor and provided with \"armor-plated glass\" is not a finding that is supported by the evidence. The hospital had several psychopathic wards\u2014one ward, number 14, was on the ground floor but it had for some time before the accident only ordinary glass in the windows. Epileptics were, on occasion, admitted to this ward, but it was made quite clear by Dr. Easton, whose evidence the learned trial judge accepted, that the responsibility for placing an epileptic in such wards was entirely that of the doctor in charge who alone had the requisite information on which such a decision could be made.\n***\nHaving admitted Lepine to a medical ward, the learned trial judge found that special precautions in the form of round the clock supervision should have been provided. This was to prevent the patient from injuring himself while in a state of automatism and to prevent him leaving the hospital and going where he might have been injured. At the close of the argument I was in some doubt how a breach of duty to have constant supervision could be said to have caused the accident because when he dove through the window there was present in the room the doctor, a nurse and three policemen, all of whom had been alerted to the danger that this man might attempt to leave the room unless he were restrained. There was at the time of the accident more protection than a single orderly or nurse would have afforded. Of course, an orderly might have prevented him from leaving the hospital earlier in the morning and if he had been run over by a car while away from the hospital, the absence of supervision which an orderly would have given would have had a causal connection with Lepine being run down and injured. Unless it could be shown that the leaving of the hospital caused or contributed to the accident, there would be no nexus between the negligence and the injury. Lack of supervision could only be a cause of the accident if there were evidence to show that during the escape from the hospital something happened to him which either caused or contributed to the mental unbalance that caused him to leap from the window\u2014by either aggravating an existing condition or creating a new one.\nand he cites evidence not relied on by the learned trial judge which, in his opinion, provided the nexus between the failure to provide round the clock supervision and the injury. That evidence was given by Dr. Easton and was as follows:\nQ. Well, now, you say that the fact that the man was brought back by the police had something to do with causing him to jump out the window? A. This is at least implied. What I think is this, that a man who suffers from epilepsy, is a known epileptic, and is subject to the traumatic experience of being returned to hospital by these police is more likely to have serious effects than if he hadn't had that experience. The experience in itself is a traumatic thing for this patient with his chronic epilepsy. In other words, these people are much more likely to do something. Now, you can't say what, but they are volatile, irritable, highly sensitive, and he is brought back by the policemen. This in itself might have been a precipitating factor. It certainly was against his best interests.\nLater, he said:\nA. Well, I can't accept the fact that this episode did not have an upsetting effect on the patient. I think it did.\nand an answer by Dr. Monckton:\nQ. Yes, Doctor, is it not also true that in a post-epileptic state of automatism that the patient may become violent if the environment changes, that is if he finds himself in strange surroundings, that this is not a good thing to keep his epilepsy under control?\nA. Yes, I believe it was Dr. Easton who raised the question of a foreign media for the patient and suggested that this might act adversely, and under some circumstances in certain patients this may be so.\nand continues:\nThis evidence of the traumatic effect of Lepine's escape from the hospital and his return in police custody, expressed though it be as a possibility, is sufficiently strong to warrant a finding that it caused or contributed to the mental state which brought on the accident and thus supplied the link between the lack of proper supervision and the accident and its consequent injuries.\nThen, in relation to Dr. Monckton, having referred to Farthing J.'s remarks in dismissing the action against Dr. Monckton previously quoted, Johnson J.A. said:\nAgainst this finding the respondent Lepine appeals. It becomes necessary to determine which was responsible\u2014the hospital or the doctor\u2014for not supplying \"round the clock\" supervision. I have quoted from the evidence of Dr. Easton that it was for the doctor in charge who had full knowledge of his patient to decide the type of care that he should receive. It is true that he was discussing the choice of institutional care, care in a psychiatric ward and medical ward care, but as the doctor was the only one with the training and experience to determine where he should be treated, it was also he who would know what kind of supervision was necessary for his safety. Dr. Shea, an employee of the hospital, was also in close touch with Lepine but he was not a qualified neurologist and was at all times working under Dr. Monckton. Dr. Monckton admitted that he had been given all the information that Dr. Shea and the hospital nurses had. He also stated that he issued no instructions that Lepine should not be allowed to leave the hospital. He was aware of the staff on duty in Ward 14. He was the one most fully aware of the danger. He requested that Lepine be treated in that ward. The responsibility for seeing that extra care be provided was, at its very least, a shared responsibility. If therefore, the breach of the duty to see that extra round the clock help was provided for Lepine is the basis of liability in this case, both Dr. Monckton and the hospital should be held liable.\nAnd in dealing further with the question of negligence, Johnson J.A. continued:\nAs I have mentioned, the learned trial judge made another finding of negligence against the hospital. A further possible ground of negligence was urged upon us during the hearing. Having found evidence to support one finding of negligence, it would not ordinarily be necessary to discuss these other heads of negligence. Because of the involvement of Dr. Monckton it is necessary to consider them.\nThe acts complained of can be stated thus:\n(i) There was a change in the condition of Lepine during the twenty-four hours which preceded the accident and these changes, known to the hospital staff, should have alerted the hospital to a new danger that had arisen and have caused them immediately to take added precautions, either by having him removed to the psychiatric ward or by putting on an additional nurse or orderly to look after him.\n(ii) (As found by the learned trial judge), on his return to the hospital Lepine should have been met by a doctor instead of an orderly and he should have been given immediate treatment.\nThe first of these grounds was not mentioned by the learned trial judge so we do not have the benefit of any finding of fact by him. My brother Cairns has fully discussed the events of that morning. From the nurses' notes it appears that Nurse Collins raised the question whether psychiatric assistance might be required. Dr. Shea saw the notes and the memorandum of his examination appears among these notes:\n\"8:15 A.M. Dr. Shea visited. At this time patient was cheerful, laughed and joked at humorous comments and incident. Talking to patient in next bed. Patient refused to lie in bed while it was being made (said he'd rather sit in chair) but returned to bed after it was made and side rails which had been let down while bed was being made were put up again. Asked for his other pillow (had one under his head when bed was brought into room) so this was given to him. Foot of bed was elevated.\"\nHaving found the patient in the same state mentally as he had been during the previous week and having satisfied himself that a transfer to a psychiatric ward was not necessary, I cannot see that it was negligence not to have him placed in that ward.\nAs to the suggestion that the hospital should have been alerted and put on extra help, I do not think that this point requires to be determined. The learned trial judge has held that there should have been extra help in the form of either an extra nurse or an extra orderly to look after Lepine for all of the period that he was in the hospital, which would include the period up to the time he escaped. This evidence, if it establishes anything, confirms that the need for such a nurse or orderly had at that time become more apparent. Instead of being negligence, it merely increased the degree of negligence that the hospital was guilty of from that time onwards.\nThe learned trial judge's final finding of fact was made by apparently adopting an argument of Lepine's counsel that Lepine, instead of being taken back to his old ward, should have been met by a physician and given treatment presumably treatment that would have immobilized him and prevented further escape. With respect, I am unable to find any evidence suggesting that such a procedure was usual or warranted. If it is an inference from the facts, the facts, I suggest, do not warrant such an inference. It is not enough to say that if this had been done no accident would have happened. In order to support such a finding surely there should be evidence that these procedures are a common and accepted practice in such cases. As I have said, no such evidence was given.\nIn summary, Farthing J. and Cairns J.A. found no negligence on the part of Dr. Monckton. Farthing J. held the hospital negligent because it placed Lepine in the category of an ordinary epileptic and that had the armorplated glass not been removed from Station 14 on the ground floor of the hospital and had the plaintiff been placed therein, this accident would not have occurred and that, having regard to Lepine's post-epileptic automatism, the only proper course was to keep him under the care of a competent orderly or nurse at all times. Cairns J. A. did not adopt Farthing J.'s approach, saying:\nAs I have said, I do not think that it is necessary to decide whether there was negligence before the 24th, because even if there was, it was not actionable. There certainly was negligence and it was continuous, commencing on the 24th. I think also that the hospital authorities were negligent in not having supervision when Lepine was returned to his room, in view of what was known to have occurred that morning and the knowledge of the orderly who saw the fight, and the fact that this could have been reported to the person in charge before he was taken back to his room, or the orderly should have stayed with him in the room. I base my conclusion, as I have stated, on the continuous negligence commencing prior to his being taken to the room.\nJohnson J. A., referring to Farthing J.'s findings against the hospital, said:\nThe learned trial judge's finding that the hospital should have provided special accommodation for epileptics who also suffered from automatism, coupled with the suggestion that such accommodation be on the ground floor and provided with \"armor-plated glass\" is not a finding that is supported by the evidence. The hospital had several psychopathic wards\u2014one ward, number 14, was on the ground floor but it had for some time before the accident only ordinary glass in the windows. Epileptics were, on occasion, admitted to this ward, but it was made quite clear by Dr. Easton, whose evidence the learned trial judge accepted, that the responsibility for placing an epileptic in such wards was entirely that of the doctor in charge who alone had the requisite information on which such a decision could be made.\nand:\nAt the close of the argument I was in some doubt how a breach of duty to have constant supervision could be said to have caused the accident because when he dove through the window there was present in the room the doctor, a nurse and three policemen, all of whom had been alerted to the danger that this man might attempt to leave the room unless he were restrained. There was at the time of the accident more protection than a single orderly or nurse would have afforded. Of course, an orderly might have prevented him from leaving the hospital earlier in the morning and if he had been run over by a car while away from the hospital, the absence of supervision which an orderly would have given would have had a causal connection with Lepine being run down and injured. Unless it could be shown that the leaving of the hospital caused or contributed to the accident, there would be no nexus between the negligence and the injury. Lack of supervision could only be a cause of the accident if there were evidence to show that during the escape from the hospital something happened to him which either caused or contributed to the mental unbalance that caused him to leap from the window\u2014by either aggravating an existing condition or creating a new one.\nand, having taken that position, went on to find a nexus between the alleged failure to provide round the clock supervision and the leap from the window relying on an hypothesis expressed only as a possibility that the traumatic effect of Lepine's escape from the hospital and his return in police custody caused or contributed to the mental state which brought on the accident. Then, dealing with the appeal against Dr. Monckton, Johnson J.A. said:\nIt becomes necessary to determine which was responsible\u2014he hospital or the doctor\u2014for not supplying \"round the clock\" supervision.\nand:\nDr. Monckton admitted that he had been given all the information that Dr. Shea and the hospital nurses had. He also stated that he issued no instructions that Lepine should not be allowed to leave the hospital. He was aware of the staff on duty in Ward 14. He was the one most fully aware of the danger.

If therefore, the breach of the duty to see that extra round the clock help was provided for Lepine is the basis of liability in this case, both Dr. Monckton and the hospital should be held liable.\nJohnson J.A. also held it was not negligence not to have placed Lepine in the psychiatric ward at 8:15 a.m. on July 24, and dealing with the allegation that Lepine, instead of being taken back to his old ward when returned to the hospital by the police, should have been met by a physician and given treatment that would have immobilized him, Johnson J.A. said:\n\u2026I am unable to find any evidence suggesting that such a procedure was usual or warranted. If it is an inference from the facts, the facts, I suggest, do not warrant such an inference. It is not enough to say that if this had been done no accident would have happened. In order to support such a finding surely there should be evidence that these procedures are a common and accepted practice in such cases. As I have said, no such evidence was given.\nSmith C.J.A., agreeing with Johnson J.A., stressed that Lepine required \"continuous supervisory care\" from July 17 forward and the hospital was negligent in not providing that care and that that negligence was the effective cause of Lepine's injuries. This was contrary to the view taken by Cairns J.A. as previously quoted.\nI have gone into the reasons for judgment somewhat extensively in order to discover the points upon which the judges of the Appellate Division were in agreement in respect of the negligence found against the two defendants, and, apart from the somewhat general finding that Lepine should have had but was not given continuous supervision on a round the clock basis from July 17 onwards, there does not appear to be a consensus on the part of the judges below other than if such supervision had been provided Lepine would not have been permitted to leave the hospital as he did between 9:05 a.m. and 9:15 a.m. on July 24, and that if he had not left the hospital and been returned to Room 402 he would not have jumped from the window.\nNo one suggests that after being returned to Room 402 and pending Dr. Monckton's arrival that Lepine was without adequate supervision or that the presence of an additional orderly or nurse would have prevented Lepine's totally unexpected leap on to the chair and through the window which was higher than usual from the floor and closed at the time.\nI am left with the distinct impression that the fact that Lepine jumped through the window greatly influenced the testimony of Dr. Easton, relied on so strongly by all judges below, who seemed unable to visualize the situation as it developed towards its climax without being able to test the steps in the tragic occurrence except in the light of the final act of jumping. It is to be noted that Dr. Easton, in referring to the final act of jumping, said:\nA. I do not think from the evidence given, and this was given in the evidence, that anyone could have prevented him going through the window at that time.\nThe case for Lepine was argued with great persuasion and sincerity. He is a most unfortunate young man and one who evokes sympathy. Farthing J. said:\nDespite his severe and permanent disabilities plaintiff impressed me as being sincerely honest and quietly courageous in his outlook on life without any tendency to self-pity.\nThis is one of those \"hard cases\" which could easily make bad law unless one adheres to established principles of responsibility in the face of the actual situation as it developed and moved to a rapid and unexpected climax when Lepine emerged from the bathroom, having given no prior sign of wanting to destroy himself.\nThe question of whether there was or was not negligence in a given situation has been dealt with in many judgments and by writers at great length. One principle emerges upon which there is universal agreement, namely, that whether or not an act or omission is negligent must be judged not by its consequences alone but also by considering whether a reasonable person should have anticipated that what happened might be a natural result of that act or omission. As was said by Lord Thankerton in Glasgow Corporation v. Muir[5],\nThe court must be careful to place itself in the position of the person charged with the duty and to consider what he or she should have reasonably anticipated as a natural and probable consequence of neglect, and not to give undue weight to the fact that a distressing accident has happened. \u2026\nApplying this principle and recognizing the duty which a doctor and a specialist such as Dr. Monckton owes to his patient and the duty which a hospital owes to a given patient as an individual, I am impelled to the conclusion that Lepine's sudden leap through the window was not an event which a reasonable man would have foreseen and have been required to take more precautions than were available in this case. Short of having put Lepine in some restraining device or of keeping him at ground level, both of which were rejected by the Appellate Division as being necessary or required, the injuries sustained by Lepine were the result of an impulse on his part which could not reasonably have been foreseen. To hold otherwise would, in my judgment, make doctors and hospitals insurers against all such hazards which they are not.\nThe appeal should, therefore, be allowed and the actions dismissed with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed and the actions dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant Hospital Board: Clement, Parlee, Irving, Mustard & Rodney, Edmonton.\nSolicitors for the appellant Monckton: Fenerty, Fenerty, McGillivray, Robertson, Prowse, Brennan & Fraser, Calgary.\nSolicitors for the respondent Lepine: Macdonald, Spitz & Lavallee, Edmonton.\n[1] (1965), 53 W.W.R. 513, 704, 54 D.L.R.

This offer was refused by the company and the parties being unable to \"reach agreement as to the amount of compensation\", arbitrators were appointed pursuant to s. 9(1) of the Act. The company claimed $36,516, and after a prolonged hearing the arbitrators made an award of $22,816. The company proceeded by way of notice of motion before the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick for an order that this award be set aside or, in the alternative, remitted to the arbitrators with a direction to award the amount indicated by the evidence in accordance with correct legal principles. By the judgment of the Appeal Division the award was ordered \"to be remitted to the arbitrators for reconsideration on admissible evidence and in accordance with correct legal principles\".\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the award of the arbitrators restored.\nThe hearing of the application to set aside or remit back the award was not an appeal. The principle governing such applications was that a Court will not look at anything to induce it to review the decision of an arbitrator on any matter submitted to him for his decision, except it be something appearing on the face of the award, or, on a document forming part of the award. (Holgate v. Killick (1861), 31 L.J. Ex 7.)\nThe mere allegation that the arbitrators apparently had acted upon evidence which was not admissible did not justify the Appeal Division in examining the evidence in order to consider whether some of it was admissible or not. Nor was the failure of the arbitrators to explain the reasons for their award a circumstance which entitled the Appeal Division to examine the record.\nThere was no allegation that the award was improperly procured or that it was ambiguous or uncertain and as there did not appear to be any error in law on its face, no legal grounds had been disclosed to justify the Appeal Division in examining the proceedings before the arbitrators or interfering with their award. The contention that the opinion of the expert appraiser called by the City to testify as to the land value per square foot of the expropriated property was inadmissible on the ground that it was hearsay evidence which was based upon calculations made from unrecorded interviews which the appraiser had had with persons who had been parties to sales of land in the area was rejected.\nCity of Vancouver v.

Appeal allowed and award of arbitrators restored.\nJohn P. Palmer, Q.C. and John W. Turnbull, for the appellant.\nB. Gilbert, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick whereby an award made by arbitrators appointed pursuant to the provisions of the City of Saint John Urban Renewal Expropriation Act, c. 129 of the Acts of Assembly of the Province of New Brunswick 1960-61 (hereinafter referred to as \"the Act\") was ordered \"to be remitted to the arbitrators for reconsideration on admissible evidence and in accordance with correct legal principles\".\nThe circumstances giving rise to the appeal are that the City of Saint John, acting under the powers conferred upon it by the Act, expropriated a property on which a service station belonging to Irving Oil Company Limited was located offering $20,500 \"as compensation for the fair value of the land\". This offer was refused by the Company and the parties being unable to \"reach agreement as to the amount of compensation\", arbitrators were appointed pursuant to s. 9(1) of the Act which provides that the Common Council of the City of Saint John and the owner of the property shall each appoint one arbitrator and that the two thus appointed shall select a third. The task required of such arbitrators and the manner in which it is to be conducted are governed by the provisions of ss. 12 and 13 of the Act which read as follows:\n12. The reference shall then be conducted under the provisions of the Arbitration Act.\n13. The arbitrators shall determine the fair value of each parcel of the land as of the date of the recording of the Council order; and the owner or owners thereof shall be entitled to be paid the sum awarded by the arbitrators, together with interest at the rate of five per centum per annum from the time when the land was acquired, taken or injuriously affected to the date of payment of compensation; the decision of the arbitrators shall be final and not subject to appeal except on a matter of law.\nThe claim of the respondent Company, as included in the Statement of Claim which was filed before the arbitrators, was made up as follows:\nLand and building\n$23,000.00\nLoss of business due to expropriation\n10,000.00\n33,000.00\nAdd 10% for forcible taking\n3,300.00\nAdd moving costs\n216.00\n$36,516.00\nAfter a prolonged hearing at which eleven witnesses testified on behalf of the Company and eight on behalf of the City, the arbitrators made the following unanimous award:\nThe undersigned arbitrators in the above expropriation, having met together and having perused the evidence and having considered the arguments made by Counsel for the expropriating authority and the owners, have unanimously agreed the losses suffered to the owners are as follows:\n(a)\nLand and buildings\n$19,600.00\n(b)\nMoving expenses\n216.00\n(c)\nDepreciation of equipment\n500.00\n(d)\nBusiness disruption and loss\n2,500.00\n$22,816.00\nWe therefore conclude that the fair value of the lands taken and injuries arising therefrom is in the amount of $22,816.00.\nThis amount, plus the usual 5% from the date of taking falls under the Provisions of the Act, and since the award exceeds the offer made by the City under Section 7 of the Act, the owners shall be entitled to costs to be taxed. The respondent proceeded by way of notice of motion before the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick for an order that this award be set aside or, in the alternative, remitted to the arbitrators with a direction to award the amount indicated by the evidence in accordance with correct legal principles.\nThe following provisions of the Arbitration Act, R.S.N.B. 1952, c. 9, are relevant in considering the circumstances under which the Supreme Court of New Brunswick is empowered to review an arbitrator's award:\n5.(i) The award made by the arbitrators or a majority of them or the umpire shall be final and binding on the parties and the persons claiming under them respectively; \u2026\n16.(1) In all cases of reference to arbitration, the Court may from time to time remit the matters referred, or any of them, to the reconsideration of the arbitrators or umpire.\n(2) Where an award is remitted, the arbitrators or umpire shall, unless the order so remitting otherwise directs, make their award within three months after the date of the order.\n17.(1) Where an arbitrator or umpire has misconducted himself, the Court may remove him.\n(2) Where an arbitrator or umpire has misconducted himself, or an arbitration or award has been improperly procured, the Court may set the award aside.\n25. Any \u2026arbitrators\u2026may, at any stage of the proceedings under a reference, and shall, if so directed by the Court, state in the form of a special case for the opinion of the Supreme Court, Appeal Division, any question of law arising in the course of the reference.\nIn the case of Doyle v. City of Saint John[1] , Chief Justice McNair, speaking on behalf of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, after referring to ss. 16 and 17 of the Act, went on to say:\nThe authority to remove an arbitrator, or set aside or remit back an award, vested by the Arbitration Act in the Supreme Court is an original jurisdiction which can be exercised by this Division, sitting as a Court of first instance. Any appellate jurisdiction, however, which we possess in relation to such matters is, in our view, exercisable only on an appeal to us from an order made by a Judge of the Supreme Court in the exercise of his co-ordinate original jurisdiction under the Act.\nIn making its application to the Appeal Division the respondent invoked the provisions of Order 64, Rule 14 of the Rules of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick which read as follows:\nAn application to set aside an award may be made at any time before the last day of the sitting of the Court of Appeal next after such award has been made and published to the parties. Provided that the Court or a Judge may by order extend the time either before or after the same is elapsed.\nThe making of such an application under this rule is the procedure which was expressly approved in the Doyle case, supra, and this interpretation of its own rule by the highest Court in New Brunswick is, of course, binding on the Courts of that Province but nothing herein contained should be taken as endorsing it.\nIt is, however, clear that the hearing of such an application is not an appeal. Chief Justice McNair was careful to point this out and in so doing referred to the reasons for judgment of Locke J. in City of Vancouver v. Brandram-Henderson of B.C. Ltd.[2] (hereinafter referred to as the \"Brandram-Henderson case\") where he said:\nThis is not an appeal from the award and the proceedings upon a motion such as this are not in the nature of a rehearing, as was the case in Cedar Rapids v. Lacoste \u2026This fact is noted in that portion of the judgment of the Judicial Committee in the second appeal in that matter, to which we were referred on the argument. We cannot in the present proceedings weigh the evidence or interfere with the award on any such ground as that it is against the weight of the evidence.\nThe respondent's notice of motion is based on the following five grounds:\n1. That the said Arbitrators misdirected and misconducted themselves by admitting and apparently acting upon evidence which by law was not admissible.\n2. That the said award is bad on the face of it in that it does not show that the item of $19,600.00 for land and buildings was the value to the owner and such amount is not supported by the evidence and established principles of law.\n3. That the award is bad on the face of it in that the item awarded for 'business disruption and loss of $2,500.00' is not supported by the evidence and the established principles of law.\n4. That the said award is bad on the face of it as the findings of fact therein are not supported by the evidence and the established principles of law.\n5. That the said Arbitrators misconducted and misdirected themselves by failing to allow the claimant, Irving Oil Company, Limited, proper compensation for loss of business and compulsory taking in accordance with established principles of law.\nThe elaborate reasons for judgment delivered by Ritchie J.A. on behalf of the Appeal Division, containing as they do a detailed review of much of the evidence taken before the arbitrators, make it apparent that in his opinion the mere reference in the award to the arbitrators \"having perused the evidence \u2026\" had the effect of incorporating the whole of the proceedings in the award itself so that the Appeal Division was entitled to re-examine and reassess all the evidence and to treat any error which it found in the conduct of the proceedings as an error appearing \"on the face of the award\". In expounding this opinion the learned judge said:\nTo grant the application we must find the award is bad on its face, as involving an apparent error either in fact or in law. In the circumstances with which we are dealing, the face of the award includes the transcript of the proceedings. City of Vancouver v. Brandram-Henderson of B.C. Limited, [1960] S.C.R. 538 at 544 and 550.\nIn the absence of any contrary declaration, it is an implied term in every reference to arbitration that the arbitrators will make their decision in accordance with the ordinary rules of law and with regard to the admissible evidence presented to them. When, as is the case here, it is submitted the award is not supported by admissible evidence and contravenes established principles of law, we may examine the transcript of the proceedings for the purpose of determining whether or not there is admissible evidence to support the findings of the arbitrators. City of Vancouver v. Brandram-Henderson of B.C. Limited (supra); Ramage v. City of Vancouver (1957) 6 D.L.R. (2d) (B.C.C.A.) at 241. If there is no admissible evidence on which the award could properly have been arrived at, it must be set aside. Lacoste v. Cedar Rapids Manufacturing & Power Company [1928] 2 D.L.R. 1 at 11, cited with approval in City of Vancouver v. Brandram-Henderson of B.C. Limited (supra).\nAs has been indicated, this is not an appeal from the arbitrators. The limited jurisdiction of a court in considering an application to set aside or remit back an award under such circumstances was considered in this Court by Sir Lyman Duff in Scotia Construction Co. Ltd. v. City of Halifax[3] , where he said:\nAn award can be set aside, (1) when it has been improperly procured, and (2) on the ground of misconduct of the arbitrator. 'Misconduct' is in this relation a term of very comprehensive denotation, and includes ambiguity and uncertainty in the award, as well as manifest error of law on the face of the award. The appellants have not established the existence of any of these grounds.\nThe principle governing such applications which has long been established at common law, was referred to by Masten J. A. speaking on behalf of the Court of Appeal of Ontario in Re Confederation Coal and Coke Ltd. and Bermingham et al.[4] , where he said:\nI find nothing in any of the cases at variance with the statements of Wilde B., in Holgate v. Killick (1861), 31 L. J. Ex. 7, where he says:\n\"The principle to be collected from the later cases is very plain, and it is, that the Court will not look at anything to induce it to review the decision of an arbitrator on any matter submitted to him for his decision, except it be something appearing on the face of the award, or, on a document forming part of the award.\"\nThe italics are my own.\nThe meaning to be given to the phrase \"error in law on the face of the award\" in such cases is described by Lord Dunedin in Champsey Bhara & Co. v. Jivraj Balloo Spinning & Weaving Co.[5] , where he said:\nAn error in law on the face of the award means, in their Lordships' view, that you can find in the award or a document actually incorporated therein, as, for instance, a note appended by the arbitrator stating the reasons for his judgment, some legal proposition which is the basis of the award and you can then say that it is erroneous \u2026 Here it is impossible to say, from what is shown on the face of the award, what mistake the arbitrators made.\nThis test was expressly adopted by Locke J. in the Brandram-Henderson of B.C. Limited case, supra, at p. 549.\nThe Brandram-Henderson case and the case of Ramage v. The City of Vancouver[6] , (hereinafter referred to as the \"Ramage case\") are the two cases chiefly relied upon as authority for the proposition that the Appeal Division was entitled to examine the record of the proceedings before the arbitrators when considering the application made by the respondent in its notice of motion.\nIn both these cases the City of Vancouver was seeking to set aside certain portions of the arbitrators' award on the ground that the property owner had not proved any damage whatever in respect of the items complained of and accordingly that nothing should have been awarded for these items. This amounted to a clear challenge of matters appearing on the face of the award on the legal ground that there was \"no evidence\" and the question so raised could only be resolved by the Court examining the proceedings to see if there was in fact any evidence. It was on this ground that the Court found itself entitled to look at the evidence.\nIn the present case it is not the City but the property owner which seeks to have the award set aside and it appears to me to be quite unrealistic to suggest that the grounds set forth in the notice of motion are to be read as meaning that the claimant, which called evidence in support of the various heads of compensation, was seeking to have the award set aside on the ground that there was no evidence whatever to support one or more of the items found by the arbitrators.\nThe suggestion that the respondent's notice of motion raised the legal question of \"no evidence\" which formed the basis of the decision in the Brandram-Henderson and Ramage cases is also clearly inconsistent with its alternative request that the award be remitted to the arbitrators with a direction to award the amount indicated by the evidence. The last four grounds set forth in the notice of motion must, I think, be taken as questioning the amounts awarded by the arbitrators rather than their right to make any award at all on the evidence before them, and such a complaint does not raise any question of law.\nI am therefore of opinion that the Brandram-Henderson and Ramage cases are distinguishable from the present case and afford no authority to justify the Appeal Division in examining the proceedings before the arbitrators on the reference here in question.\nThe first ground in the notice of motion alleges that the arbitrators admitted and apparently acted upon evidence which by law was not admissible but this is a very different thing from saying that there was no admissible evidence at all. In the course of his reasons for judgment, however, Ritchie J.A. said that:\nIf arbitrators proceed illegally as for instance by deciding on evidence which was not admissible or generally speaking on principles of construction which the law does not countenance there is on the face of the award an error in law which may be ground for setting it aside. Kelantan Government v. Duff Development Co. [1923] A.C. 395 (H. of L.), McCain v. City of Saint John.\nIf the learned judge is suggesting an error in law on the part of the arbitrators which can only become apparent after an examination of the evidence is to be treated as an error in law on the face of the award, then with all respect I disagree with him. What was said by Viscount Cave in the Kelantan Government case was that where the reference was a reference as to construction:\n\u2026it follows that, unless it appears on the face of the award that the arbitrator has proceeded on principles which were wrong in law, his conclusions as to the construction of the deed must be accepted. No doubt an award may be set aside for an error of law appearing on the face of it; and no doubt a question of construction is (generally speaking) a question of law. But where a question of construction is the very thing referred for arbitration, then the decision of the arbitrator upon that point cannot be set aside by the Court only because the Court would itself have come to a different conclusion. If it appears by the award that the arbitrator has proceeded illegally\u2014for instance, that he has decided on evidence which in law was not admissible or on principles of construction which the law does not countenance, then there is error in law which may be ground for setting aside the award.\nThe italics are my own.\nIn the same connection Ritchie J.A. also refers to the case of Walford, Baker & Co. v. Macfie & Sons[7] and he cites that portion of the judgment of Lush J. where he said that:\n\u2026when it appears that an umpire allows to be given, and acts upon, evidence which is absolutely inadmissible, and which goes to the very root of the question before him, this Court has ample jurisdiction to set the award aside on the ground of legal misconduct on the part of the umpire.\nI think it desirable to point out that that was a case which was referred to arbitration under the terms of a contract of sale dated May 14, 1914 which was incorporated by reference on the face of the arbitrators' award and where the arbitrators found that the sellers were \"entitled to suspend delivery under this contract\". The very short judgment of Lush J. is predicated upon the following statement:\nWhen one observes that the contract of May 14, 1914 which was the only matter before the umpire, contains no clause providing for the suspension of deliveries by the sellers, it is manifest that the umpire, in making his award, looked to some other document.\nIt was accordingly manifest on the face of the award in that case that an error had been made.\nIf it is alleged to be apparent on the face of an award that any part of it is wholly based upon evidence which was not properly admitted before the arbitrators, then, as has been indicated, there may be cases where it is permissible to examine the evidence, but the general rule, and the one which in my opinion applies in the present case is that stated in Russell on Arbitration, 17th ed. at p. 179, where it is said:\nIn deciding as to admissibility of evidence tendered, the arbitrator must act honestly and judicially, and if while so acting he decides erroneously that evidence is or is not admissible, that is not in itself misconduct, and (as with other mistakes) his award will not be set aside on that ground, unless the error appears on its face. It should be noticed also that the terms of s. 25 of the Arbitration Act, supra, provide for a reference at any stage of the proceedings in the form of a special case for the opinion of the Supreme Court, Appeal Division, on any question of law arising in the course of the arbitration and if one of the parties seeks to have evidence excluded on the ground of its inadmissibility, application can be made to the arbitrator to state a case for the Appeal Division under this section and if the application is refused the proceedings can be adjourned so as to allow for an application to the court for an order directing a case to be stated. Procedure is thus afforded under the Act for settling the question of whether certain evidence is to be admitted or not before the arbitrators make their award.\nWith all respect for the conclusion reached by the Appeal Division, I do not think that the mere allegation that the arbitrators apparently had acted upon evidence which was not admissible justified that Court in examining the evidence in order to consider whether some of it was admissible or not.\nRitchie J.A., however, in the course of his reasons for judgment, found that there was another ground upon which the Appeal Division was entitled to examine the record and in so doing he said:\nAs the board chose not to explain the reasons for their award, we have, with one exception, no precise knowledge of just what considerations did determine the amount of the individual items comprising the compensation they considered the company should receive. In such circumstances the record also may be examined for indications of the attitudes with which the members of the Board approached the problem entrusted to them.\nIt is clear that one of the grounds upon which the Appeal Division granted the present application was that the arbitrators had failed to be more explicit in the terms of their award.\nAfter having stated that the effect of certain of the respondent's evidence was not challenged \"by any admissible contrary evidence\" Ritchie J.A. went on to say:\nIf the board saw fit to reject the testimony of those four witnesses they should have done so explicitly and should not have left open to conjecture the principle on which they determined the amount of compensation for the land and building and how such compensation was computed. I am, with respect, unable to agree with the reasoning of the learned trial judge in this regard and I would on the contrary adopt the following passage from Russell on Arbitration, supra, at p. 322 as applicable to the circumstances here in question:\nThere is no reason why an arbitrator who has not been asked to state an award in the form of a special case should on the face of his award give any reasons for any part thereof, whether the substantive part or the costs part.\nAccordingly, I do not think that the failure of the arbitrators to explain the reasons for their award was a circumstance which entitled the Appeal Division to examine the record.\nIn the present case there is no allegation that the award was improperly procured or that it is ambiguous or uncertain and as there does not appear to me to be any error in law on its face, I have reached the opinion that no grounds have been disclosed to justify the Appeal Division in examining the proceedings before the arbitrators or interfering with their award and I would allow the appeal on this ground.\nIt would be unnecessary to say more than this were it not for the fact that it was strenuously contended in the course of the argument before us that the opinion of the expert appraiser called by the City to testify as to the land value per square foot of the expropriated property was inadmissible on the ground that it was hearsay evidence which was based upon calculations made from unrecorded interviews which the appraiser had had with forty-seven persons who had been parties to sales of land in the area. In this regard, Ritchie J.A. made the following finding:\nBased on the study he had made of market conditions in the area as represented by forty-six unidentified and one identified transactions, Mr. de Stecher applied a unit value of $40 per front foot\u2026Opinion evidence as to the value of land based on such a foundation was inadmissible. It was admitted by the Board despite strong objections of counsel for the Company. The validity of an opinion such as expressed is only as good as the validity of the information on which it is based. The precise information obtained in respect of all forty-seven transactions, including price and the dimensions and physical characteristics of each property should have been submitted to the Board.\nThis opinion was in accordance with a decision rendered by the same judge on behalf of the same bench of judges in respect of evidence of the same witness in McCain v. City of Saint John[8] , where he said :\nMuch of his (Mr. de Stecher's) opinion evidence was founded on hearsay information obtained from sources not always disclosed.\nIn the course of making his appraisal, Mr. de Stecher compiled a market survey covering sales of as many properties in the area during the preceding four years as he could obtain information on. \u2026The report indicates the market survey rests on a foundation of hearsay and is restricted mainly to sales by trustees of estates to public bodies. When an appraiser elects to rest his valuation of real estate on sales of comparable properties, he should testify he has examined each of them.\nThe greater part of the de Stecher evidence, including the appraisal report, was inadmissible.\nCounsel on behalf of the City of Saint John pointed out that if the opinion of a qualified appraiser is to be excluded because it is based upon information acquired from others who have not been called to testify in the course of his investigation, then proceedings to establish the value of land would take on an endless character as each of the appraiser's informants whose views had contributed to the ultimate formation of his opinion would have to be individually called. To characterize the opinion evidence of a qualified appraiser as inadmissible because it is based on something that he has been told is, in my opinion, to treat the matter as if the direct facts of each of the comparable transactions which he has investigated were at issue whereas what is in truth at issue is the value of his opinion.\nThe nature of the source upon which such an opinion is based cannot, in my view, have any effect on the admissibility of the opinion itself. Any frailties which may be alleged concerning the information upon which the opinion was founded are in my view only relevant in assessing the weight to be attached to that opinion, and in the present case this was entirely a question for the arbitrators and not one upon which the Appeal Division could properly rest its decision.\nI have not found it necessary to deal with all the questions raised in the very exhaustive judgment of the Court of Appeal, but I think it desirable to say that I do not think it to be apparent from the face of the award or otherwise that the arbitrators considered anything other than \"value to the owner\" in reaching their award. In view of all the above, I would allow this appeal and restore the award made by the arbitrators. The appellant will have his costs in this Court and in the Court of Appeal.\nAppeal allowed and award of arbitrators restored.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Palmer, O'Connell, Leger & Turnbull, Saint John.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Gilbert, McGloan & Gillis, Saint John.\n[1] (1964), 44 D.L.R.

In 1961, the respondent applied for a compulsory licence under s. 67(1) of the Patent Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 203, on the ground that there had been abuse of the exclusive rights under the patent. The Commissioner of Patents ordered the grant of a licence and fixed the royalty to be paid thereunder. On appeal, the Exchequer Court affirmed the granting of the licence but referred the matter back to the Commissioner to reconsider the question of royalty. The appeal to this Court was on the granting of the licence only.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Curiam: Where an applicant for a compulsory licence under ss. 67 and 68 of the Patent Act has established that the patented invention is capable of being worked in Canada and that it has not been worked in Canada on a commercial scale by the end of the 3-year period allowed in s. 67(1), the onus of justifying the use he has made of his monopoly falls on the patentee. On the facts of this case, the appellant has failed to satisfy the onus thus placed on it, and, therefore, the compulsory licence was rightly granted.\nPer Spence J.: The trial judge rightly rejected the main contention of the appellant that the infringement of its patent by many competitors, and particularly the respondent, provided a \"satisfactory reason\" within s. 67(2)(a) of the Patent Act. The evidence in this case was a clear demonstration of the appellant's intent not to work the invention in Canada on a commercial scale.\nBrevets\u2014Licence obligatoire\u2014D\u00e9faut d'exploiter l'invention sur une \u00e9chelle commerciale\u2014Abus des droits exclusifs\u2014Justification du d\u00e9faut d'exploitation\u2014Loi sur les Brevets, S.R.C. 1952, c. 203, arts. 2(j), 46, 67, 68.\nEn 1954, un brevet se rapportant \u00e0 des bracelets de montre extensibles fut \u00e9mis \u00e0 l'appelante. En 1961, l'intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9senta une requ\u00eate pour obtenir une licence obligatoire en vertu de l\u2019art. 67(1) de la Loi sur les Brevets, S.R.C. 1952, c. 203, pour le motif qu'il y avait eu abus des droits exclusifs conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par le brevet. Le Commissaire des Brevets a ordonn\u00e9 l'\u00e9mission d'une licence et a fix\u00e9 les droits \u00e0 \u00eatre pay\u00e9s. Sur appel, la Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier a confirm\u00e9 l'\u00e9mission de la licence mais a renvoy\u00e9 l'affaire devant le Commissaire sur la question des droits.

Les faits dans cette cause d\u00e9montrent que l'appelante n'a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 satisfaire ce fardeau, et, en cons\u00e9quence, l'\u00e9mission de la licence \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e.\nLe Juge Spence: Le juge au proc\u00e8s \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9 de rejeter la pr\u00e9tention principale de l'appelante \u00e0 l'effet que la violation de son brevet par plusieurs concurrents, et particuli\u00e8rement par l'intim\u00e9e, \u00e9tait une justification en vertu de l'art. 67(2)(a) de la Loi sur les Brevets.

Appel rejet\u00e9.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Thurlow J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada[2], affirming a decision of the Commissioner of Patents. Appeal dismissed.\nChristopher Robinson, Q.C.,and Samuel Godinsky, Q.C., for the appellant. Gordon F. Henderson, Q.C., and R. G. McClenahan, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Taschereau C.J. and Judson, Ritchie and Hall JJ. was delivered by\nHALL J.:\u2014The appellant was granted Canadian Patent No. 505676 on September 7, 1954. It was for an expandable wrist watch bracelet consisting of a number of metal sleeves, leaf springs and U-bows with the addition of two end pieces for coupling the bracelet to the watch. Apart from the manufacture of suitable materials and tools with which to make the parts, the production of these bracelets consists of the relatively commonplace operation of stamping out the required parts by means of presses, the assembling of the parts into bracelets and the cleaning, polishing and mounting or packaging for sale of the end product. The assembly portion of the operation is one which can be carried out by men or women after a comparatively short period of training and practice.\nOn January 3, 1961, the respondent applied to the Commissioner of Patents for a compulsory licence under s. 67(1) of the Patent Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 203, which reads:\n67.(1) The Attorney General of Canada or any person interested may at any time after the expiration of three years from the date of the grant of a patent apply to the Commissioner alleging in the case of that patent that there has been an abuse of the exclusive rights thereunder and asking for relief under this Act.\nThe Commissioner ordered the grant of a licence on April 26, 1962, in the following terms:\nMy conclusion is that a compulsory licence is to be granted. The licence is to be effective as of the date of this decision. The licence is non-exclusive and is valid in favour of the licensee, Metalliflex Ltd. for the manufacture in Canada of bracelets incorporating any of the features of the patent and according to my concept of manufacture as set out in this decision.\nI have given a great deal of thought to the basis of and the amount of royalty. In this particular case I have decided that a royalty based on manufacturing cost or sales price with all the appendages of discounts and returns would unnecessarily complicate accounting and reports. A straight royalty on pieces sold by the manufacturer and accepted by the purchaser would be much easier to compile and account for. I therefore set the royalty at ten cents per piece manufactured, and sold by the manufacturer.\nThe parties will have sixty days within which to agree on the terms of the licence and present a draft to me for acceptation. If the parties fail to do so within the time set, I shall draft the licence upon my own terms. The parties were not able to agree on the terms of the licence and the Commissioner on July 31, 1962, settled the form of the licence in part as follows:\n1.The said Metalliflex shall have the right to manufacture and sell in Canada extensible watch bracelets embodying the features of the invention claimed in Canadian Patent No. 505,676 from and after the 26th day of April 1962, the date of my decision, up to the expiration of the term for which the said patent has been granted.\n2.Metalliflex shall pay to Rodi a royalty of ten cents (.10c) for each such bracelet manufactured and sold by it; this royalty to be paid on all sales made subsequent to the 26th day of April 1962, the date of my decision.\nThe licence contained provisions for the keeping of accurate records and furnishing by the respondent to the appellant of all information necessary for the computation and payment of the royalty, including the right of the respondent to inspect and take copies of all records pertaining to the manufacture of watch bracelets under the patent in question.\nThe appellant appealed to the Exchequer Court of Canada[3] from the decision of the Commissioner. The appeal was heard by Thurlow J. who gave judgment on November 16, 1962, dismissing the appeal as to the granting of the licence but directing that:\n\u2026the royalty to be paid by the Respondent on bracelets made pursuant to the said licence other than the Respondent's \"Bandmaster\" bracelets be and the same is hereby referred back to the Commissioner of Patents for consideration.\nThe appellant now appeals from the order granting the licence. The matter of the royalty payable was not an issue in this Court.\nThe parts of s. 67 of the Patent Act relevant to this appeal read:\n67.(1) The Attorney General of Canada or any person interested may at any time after the expiration of three years from the date of the grant of a patent apply to the Commissioner alleging in the case of that patent that there has been an abuse of the exclusive rights thereunder and asking for relief under this Act.\n(2) The exclusive rights under a patent shall be deemed to have been abused in any of the following circumstances:\n(a) if the patented invention (being one capable of being worked within Canada) is not being worked within Canada on a commercial scale, and no satisfactory reason can be given for such non-working, but if an application is presented to the Commissioner on this ground, and the Commissioner is of opinion that the time that has elapsed since the grant of the patent has by reason of the nature of the invention or for any other cause been insufficient to enable the invention to be worked within Canada on a commercial scale, the Commissioner may make an order adjourning the application for such period as will in his opinion be sufficient for that purpose;\n(b) if the working of the invention within Canada on a commercial scale is being prevented or hindered by the importation from abroad of the patented article by the patentee or persons claiming under him, or by persons directly or indirectly purchasing from him, or by other persons against whom the patentee is not taking or has not taken any proceedings for infringement;\n***\n(d) if, by reason of the refusal of the patentee to grant a licence or licences upon reasonable terms, the trade or industry of Canada or the trade of any person or class of persons trading in Canada, or the establishment of any new trade or industry in Canada, is prejudiced, and it is in the public interest that a licence or licences should be granted;\n(3) It is declared with relation to every paragraph of subsection (2) that, for the purpose of determining whether there has been any abuse of the exclusive rights under a patent, it shall be taken that patents for new inventions are granted not only to encourage invention but to secure that new inventions shall so far as possible be worked on a commercial scale in Canada without undue delay.\nWork on a commercial scale is defined in s. 2(j) as follows:\n(i) \"work on a commercial scale\" means the manufacture of the article or the carrying on of the process described and claimed in a specification for a patent, in or by means of a definite and substantial establishment or organization and on a scale that is adequate and reasonable under the circumstances.\nSection 68 reads in part:\n68. On being satisfied that a case of abuse of the exclusive rights under a patent has been established, the Commissioner may exercise any of the following powers as he may deem expedient in the circumstances:\n(a) he may order the grant to the applicant of a licence on such terms as the 'Commissioner may think expedient, including a term precluding the licensee from importing into Canada any goods the importation of which, if made by persons other than the patentee or persons claiming under him would be an infringement of the patent, and in such case the patentee and all licensees for the time being shall be deemed to have mutually covenanted against such importation; a licensee under this paragraph is entitled to call upon the patentee to take proceedings to prevent infringement of the patent, and if the patentee refuses, or neglects to do so within two months after being so called upon, the licensee may institute proceedings for infringement in his own name as though he were the patentee, making the patentee a defendant; a patentee so added as defendant is not liable for any costs unless he enters an appearance and takes part in the proceedings; service on the patentee may be effected by leaving the writ at his address or at the address of his representative for service as appearing in the records of the Patent Office; in settling the terms of a licence under this paragraph the Commissioner shall be guided as far as may be by the following considerations:\n(i) he shall, on the one hand, endeavour to secure the widest possible user of the invention in Canada consistent with the patentee deriving a reasonable advantage from his patent rights,\n(ii) he shall, on the other hand, endeavour to secure to the patentee the maximum advantage consistent with the invention being worked by the licensee at a reasonable profit in Canada, and\nThe appellant's patent was at all times by s. 46 of the Act \"subject to the conditions in this Act prescribed;\".\nIt will be seen that the decision of the Commissioner and upheld by Thurlow J. was essentially one of fact and the question to be determined was whether there had been an abuse of the exclusive rights within the meaning of s. 67(2) above.\nOnce an applicant for a compulsory licence under ss. 67 and 68 has established that the patented invention is capable of being worked in Canada and that it was not being worked in Canada on a commercial scale by the end of the three-year period allowed in s. 67(1) the onus of justifying the use he has made of his monopoly; the onus of proving, in order to resist the granting of a compulsory licence, that his patented process is carried on, or his patented article manufactured to an adequate extent in Canada or of giving a satisfactory reason why it is not so carried on or manufactured is imposed on the patentee. Parker J. in the Hatschek's Patents[4] and Luxmore J. in McKechnie's case[5].\nIn the present case it was established beyond question that at the time of the filing of the respondent's application, namely January 3, 1961, manufacture of the invention in Canada was virtually non-existent. Thurlow J. said in his judgment at p. 238:\nThe facts with respect to the working of the invention in Canada are first that there was no working at all in the first three years following the grant of the patent except that in 1956 the respondent made some 2,200 bracelets and parts for several thousand more according to a patent which it held, but was prevented from going into full production and putting them on the market by an interlocutory injunction granted in an action brought by the appellant for infringement of the patent here in question. In November of the following year shortly after the filing by Watchstraps Inc. of an application to the Commissioner alleging abuse of the patent and asking for a compulsory licence to manufacture under it in Canada the appellant organized a Canadian subsidiary company known as Rowi Limited which at some point thereafter in 1957 or in 1958 began assembling bracelets of the patented type from parts made by the appellant in Germany. The evidence does not clearly show what facilities Rowi Limited had at the time other than an office or how many employees it had engaged in assembling bracelets. Nor is there satisfactory evidence as to the extent to which the bracelets were assembled from parts as opposed to the mere attaching of end pieces made in Germany to bracelets made and otherwise assembled in Germany. It is conceded that the mere attaching in Canada of end pieces to bracelets otherwise assembled in Germany could not be regarded as manufacture of the bracelets in Canada. In 1958 Henry Amsell, who carried on business in Montreal under the firm name of Amsell Brothers, also began assembling bracelets of the patented type for Rowi Limited and installed in the cellar of his premises several machines which had been sent by the appellant to Rowi Limited. These were presses which could be used to make the parts for the bracelets but they were not put in use. There is evidence which I think is corroborated by the course of events which followed and which I would regard as credible that the machines were in fact brought to Canada and installed in the premises of Amsell Brothers not for the purpose of producing parts but as a camouflage in the hope of making it appear whenever necessary that the patented bracelets were being manufactured in Canada.\nand at p. 240:\nIn fact what was happening in the years 1958, 1959 and 1960 was that the appellant and Rowi Limited were both selling to Canadian customers. In 1958 and part of 1959 while the appellant's prices were somewhat lower than those of Rowi and in addition the appellant allowed a 5 per cent quantity discount which Rowi could not offer the differences were apparently not of enough significance to greatly outweigh the advantage which Rowi possessed of being able to deliver more promptly and sales by Rowi increased to the point where in 1959 they were somewhat higher than those made in Canada by the appellant. In September 1959, however, the prices of bracelets sold by Rowi Limited were raised by 20 per cent while those of the appellant remained the same and this gave the bracelets supplied by the appellant a marked advantage. Thereafter sales by Rowi Limited declined sharply while those of the appellant increased. This price policy remained in effect until March of 1961, when following the presentation of the respondents petition, and the change in the management personnel of Rowi Limited and its sales representation and that of the appellant in Canada, arrangements were made to divert to Rowi Limited all Canadian orders for patented bracelets of the kinds which the appellant and Rowi Limited had theretofore sold on the Canadian market, all of which carried the trade mark \"Fixoflex\", and the prices therefore were reduced to the point where they were lower than any previous Rowi prices and only slightly above those at which the same articles had been supplied by the appellant from Germany. About the middle of March 1961 Rowi Limited acquired from another bracelet manufacturer a plant in Montreal which included several machines and shortly afterwards the machinery formerly installed in the premises of Amsell Brothers was moved to the new location and installed there. An automatic feeding device for one of these machines was then obtained, in Montreal, and commencing in July it and the machines acquired from the other bracelet manufacturer were used to make parts for the production of the patented bracelets. In the period from the change-over to the end of November 1961, Rowi Limited sold 76,904 of the patented bracelets. In the same period, together with about three weeks of December, 1961, it produced a total of 38,954 bracelets some from parts which it had made and some from German made parts and it imported from Germany some 25,992 bracelets complete except for the attachment of end pieces which were attached in Montreal. During the same period, but commencing in June, 1961, the appellant also sold in Canada under the trade mark \"Supra Fixoflex\" some 13,986 bracelets of a new and more attractive type. None of this type of bracelet had been made or assembled in Canada up to the time of the hearing and there was no evidence of so much as plans to manufacture it in Canada.\nand at p. 242:\nLeaving aside the question whether the assembly of bracelets in Canada from parts made in Germany should be regarded as manufacture of the patented invention in Canada within the meaning of the definition of s. 2(j) it is to my mind apparent that up to the time of the filing of the respondent's petition for a compulsory licence there never had been anything in the way of working the invention in Canada that could be characterized as proportionate to or as bearing any reasonably close relationship to the demand for the patented article in this country and that while the situation changed somewhat after mid-February 1961, and particularly in the latter half of that year, even then the production of the patented bracelets in Canada whether assembled from parts made in Canada or from parts made in Germany was only 38,354 against a total market enjoyed for the period of 90,890 and that even in the months of September, October and November when production was at something of a peak, it still amounted in each month to less than half of the total quantities of patented bracelets sold on the Canadian market and also to considerably less than the quantities of Fixoflex bracelets sold in Canada.\nIt was submitted that by some time in November production of bracelets by Rowi Limited had reached 2,150 per week which multiplied by 52 would yield a number sufficient to meet the yearly Canadian market then available to the appellant and that accordingly at the time of the hearing the scale of manufacture by Rowi was adequate within the meaning of the definition. As to this it may first be observed that the production figures show that if the scale actually reached 2,150 in a week in November it was not maintained for the whole month, though it may have been maintained for the first three weeks of December. I do not think however that the problem is to be resolved by directing attention to a scale of production over so short a period if working for a short period were sufficient it would be just as logical to say that the scale was adequate because on the day or in the last hour or minute before the hearing so many articles were produced, which to my mind would be absurd. Capacity to manufacture on an adequate scale is one thing. Actual manufacture is quite a different thing. The evidence that in the last three or four weeks before the hearing Rowi had produced on a scale of 2,150 per week may well indicate that at the time of hearing it had the capacity to produce on a scale sufficient to supply the available Canadian market for a year. But though Rowi had been in existence for upwards of four years it had never operated for a year on anything approaching such a scale and it is only if the expectations of the production manager of Rowi Limited, who was not a policy maker, are taken as fact (an assumption which on the evidence I would not regard as justified) that one could be led to think that Rowi's production was in fact on a scale approximately equal to the available Canadian market. The cold facts are that in no year and in no month or season for which figures were given in the whole four-year history of Rowi had its scale of production equalled or even approached the market for that year or that month or that season.\nIn view of these facts and having regard also to the nature of the invention, the comparatively short time required to establish a plant for the manufacture of it in Canada, and to the time which had elapsed since the grant of the patent as well as to the size of the Canadian market which is shown to have been available to the appellant during that period, I am of the opinion that it has been established that the invention was not being worked on a scale that was adequate in the circumstances within the meaning of s. 2(j) either before or at the time of the presentation of the respondent's application or at the time of the hearing.\nThe appellant sought to satisfy the onus which was thus placed on it by leading evidence to the effect that from the time the patent was obtained it was harassed by illegal importations and by infringers (including the respondent) and it was involved in litigation with the respondent challenging the validity of the patent which was not brought to a successful conclusion until the appeal in Metalliflex Limited v. Rodi & Wienenberger Aktiengesellschaft[6] was decided in this Court on December 19, 1960, and by evidence of the quantities of the bracelet it had assembled or manufactured in Canada either by itself or by its subsidiary Rowi Limited.\nThurlow J., after referring to a prior application for a compulsory licence in October 1957 by Watchstraps Inc., dealt with these submissions as follows at p. 244:\nThere is on the evidence no reason to doubt that not long after the grant of the patent imported bracelets which infringed the patent made their appearance on the Canadian market and though the situation improved to some extent after a number of infringement actions had been brought by the appellant, in three of which interlocutory injunctions effective in the Province of Quebec were obtained, in general it continued throughout the period to the end of 1960 and reached a high point in 1958 and 1959. None of the actions had, however, come to trial when in October 1957 Watchstraps Inc., one of the parties against whom an injunction had been obtained, filed an application alleging abuses of the patent under clauses (a), (b) and (d) of s. 67(2) and asking for a compulsory licence. In April 1958 the action against Watchstraps Inc. as well as that brought against the respondent came to trial but judgment was reserved and had not been delivered when in July 1958 the appellant filed its counterstatement opposing the application for a compulsory licence.\nHe then discusses the contents of the counterstatement opposing Watchstraps Inc.'s application for a compulsory licence and continues at p. 245:\nThe statement went on to say that the appellant had asserted its patent against the sale by the applicant of watchstraps alleged to embody the invention of a patent of which the applicant claimed to be the owner, and that the appellant was awaiting the judgment of the Superior Court of the Province of Quebec in the action which had been tried at Montreal in April 1958, but nowhere in the statement is there any suggestion whatever that either infringing imports or challenges to the validity of the appellant's patent had anything to do with the failure to work the invention in Canada on a commercial scale within the meaning of the statutory definition. Nor was any explanation offered as to why there had been nothing in the way of working the invention in Canada or of preparation for such working in the three-year period from the grant of the patent in September 1954 to November 7, 1957.\n***\nIn September 1958 judgments were given in the actions tried in April 1958 and by these it was held that claims 1 and 2 of the appellant's patent were invalid and that while claim 3 was valid, it had not been infringed except by certain of the bracelets sold by Watchstraps Inc. The appellant thereupon appealed to the Court of Queen's Bench in both cases and the interlocutory injunctions were continued in effect but apparently following the trial judgment competition from infringing imports increased. In June of the following year the judgment in the case of the respondent was reversed and claims 1 and 2 were held to be valid and infringed by a bracelet made according to a patent held by the respondent. Shortly after this success, in September 1958, the price difference which had already been referred to was established. The customers were advised that the increase in the price of bracelets assembled in Canada was due to \"augmentation of costs for wages, manufacturing improvements (installation of modern automatic machinery), general overhead, advertising, etc., which price increase was long siuce due to appear.\" That these were in fact the reasons for the increase was not established. On the contrary the evidence shows that they were not the reasons. At that time the policy being followed was to divert the orders as far as possible to the appellant and the establishment of the price difference was one of the ways adopted to carry the policy into effect.\n***\nOn the evidence the failure to work appears to me to have been entirely a matter of choice on the part of the appellant for as I view it there was never any real difficulty in obtaining a substantial market or in organizing manufacture in Canada and the fact that the appellant when spurred by an application for a compulsory licence sent machinery to Canada and in its counter-statement opposing the application referred to plans to manufacture on a scale sufficient to meet the whole Canadian market appears to me to indicate that it recognized at the time that it had no satisfactory reason for not working the invention on a scale to supply the market available to it. Moreover, while the judgment of the Quebec Superior Court in September 1958 holding claims 1 and 2 of the patent invalid may have afforded some reason for not immediately pursuing the plans which had been set out in the counter-statement, if indeed such plans ever existed, on the evidence there was no justification following the reversal of that judgment in June 1959 either for failure to proceed with the plans or for the appellant's conduct in so raising the price of Rowi produced bracelets as to make it impossible for them to compete on the Canadian market with those made by the appellant in Germany.\n***\nOn the facts disclosed and having regard to s. 67(3) I am of the opinion that no satisfactory reason for failure to work the invention in Canada on a commercial scale has been established and that the case is one in which abuse within the meaning of s. 67(2)(a) is shown to have existed both before and at the time of the presentation of the respondent's application and to have persisted, though alleviated to some extent in the meantime, up to the time of the hearing.\nAll of these findings and conclusions are amply supported by the evidence which the Commissioner and Thurlow J. had before them.\nThe appeal should accordingly be dismissed with costs payable by the appellant.\nSPENCE J.:\u2014I have had the privilege of reading the reasons of my brother Hall and I agree with those reasons and with his conclusions. I desire, however, to add a few words in reference to the main contention of the appellant in this Court which was that the infringement of its patent by many competitors including, particularly, the respondent provided to the appellant a \"satisfactory reason\" within s. 67(2) (a) of the Patent Act excusing it from failure to work the invention in Canada on a commercial scale.\nI am of the opinion that there may well be cases where such infringement might provide such \"satisfactory reason\", and particularly where it would appear that the patent which the patentee held might be found to be invalid in Canada. Thurlow J. in his reasons has rejected the alleged excuse as a \"satisfactory reason\" and my brother Hall has agreed with that rejection. I am of the opinion that such rejection is proper in view of the evidence in this case and particularly in view of two facts which were there established.\nFirstly, in the three-year period which followed the grant of the patent there was, to all intents and purposes, no working of the patent by the patentee in Canada. As both Thurlow J. and my brother Hall have pointed out, it was quite feasible that the patent should be worked in Canada and, in fact, outside of the assembly of proper tools and materials, the process of manufacture was quite simple and a staff could be trained and in operation in a very short time indeed.\nSecondly, when the appellant's patent had been declared valid by the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal Side) in the Province of Quebec, one would have expected the appellant, freed of the worry of those infringe- ments, to have proceeded apace at working its invention in Canada. Instead, the appellant took the exact opposite course and by increasing the price at which its solely owned subsidiary, Rodi Ltd., sold in Canada, and at the same time holding fast its own sale price in Canada, it contrived to turn all purchases to its own foreign-manufactured articles. It continued that course until March of 1961, following the presentation of this respondent's application for compulsory licence.\nIn my view, that evidence is a clear demonstration of the appellant's intent not to work the invention in Canada on a commercial scale, an intention which was only abandoned when it became apparent that such a course would result inevitably in the compulsory licence being granted.\nFor these reasons, I concur in the dismissal of the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Smart & Biggar, Ottawa.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Gowling, MacTavish, Osborne & Henderson, Ottawa.\n[1] [1963] Ex.

In its petition, it sought to add five new claims to the patent, as previously issued, but did not seek to make any change in the original disclosure, nor to abandon any of the claims contained in the original patent. The petition for re-issue was refused by the Commissioner. On appeal to the Exchequer Court, the Commissioner contended that the Court was without jurisdiction to hear an appeal from a decision made under s. 50 of the Act. The Exchequer Court found it unnecessary to determine this point and ruled against the appellant on the merits of the appeal. The appellant appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe wording of s. 44 of the Patent Act permits an appeal to the Exchequer Court in cases coming within s. 50 of the Act.\nThe appellant claimed that its patent was defective or inoperative by reason of its not having claimed that which it had a right to claim and that such error arose from mistake. The appellant believed that to comply with s. 41(1) of the Patent Act all that was necessary was that a product claim be dependent on a claim for a process by means of which the substance could be prepared and it was not realized that a claim for a specific product should be dependent upon a process claim specifically defining the production of that substance. The question to be determined was therefore whether that alleged mistake was a mistake within the meaning of s. 50 of the Act. That section deals only with a patent which is defective or inoperative. It contemplates the existence of a valid patent which requires re-issue in order to become fully effective and operative. In this case, the patent for which re-issue is sought has been held by this Court to be invalid (ante p. 189). Furthermore, assuming, without deciding, that a mistake of law could constitute that kind of mistake which is contemplated by s. 50, the section can only operate if the patentee can satisfy the Commissioner that, because of his mistake, the patent fails to represent that which the inventor truly intended to have been covered and secured by it. The appellant has not met that test. The mistake which is alleged is a failure, in the light of existing understanding of the law, to appreciate that a process claim of the kind here in question would not be sufficient to support the claim to the product under the requirements of s. 41(1) of the Act. A mistake of that kind does not fall within s. 50 of the Act.\nBrevets\u2014Requ\u00eate pour red\u00e9livrance\u2014Une erreur concernant la loi est-elle une erreur dans le sens de l'art. 50 de la Loi sur les Brevets, S.R.C.1952, c. 203.\nAppels\u2014Requ\u00eate pour la red\u00e9livrance d'un brevet, refus\u00e9e\u2014Y a-t-il appel devant la Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier\u2014Loi sur les Brevets, S.R.C. 1952, c. 203, arts. 2(a), 42, 44, 50.\nAyant abandonn\u00e9 un brevet qui lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mis en 1959 relativement \u00e0 un produit pharmaceutique utilis\u00e9 pour diminuer le contenu du sucre dans le sang, l'appelante a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate au Commissaire des Brevets, sous le r\u00e9gime de l'art. 50 de la Loi sur les Brevets, S.R.C. 1952, c. 203, pour obtenir la red\u00e9livrance du brevet. Dans sa requ\u00eate, l'appelante a cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 ajouter cinq nouvelles revendications au brevet, tel qu'\u00e9mis pr\u00e9alablement, mais n'a pas cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 faire de changements dans la divulgation originale et n'a pas cherch\u00e9 non plus \u00e0 abandonner aucune des revendications contenues dans le brevet original. La requ\u00eate pour red\u00e9livrance fut refus\u00e9e par le Commissaire. Sur appel \u00e0 la Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier, le Commissaire a soutenu que la Cour \u00e9tait sans juridiction pour entendre un appel d'une d\u00e9cision rendue sous le r\u00e9gime de l'art. 50 du statut. La Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier n'a pas jug\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9terminer ce point et a donn\u00e9 raison au Commissaire sur les m\u00e9rites de l'appel. D'o\u00f9 le pourvoi de l'appelante devant cette Cour.\nArr\u00eat: L'appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9.\nLa phras\u00e9ologie de l'art. 44 de la Loi sur les Brevets permet un appel \u00e0 la Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier dans les causes tombant sous le r\u00e9gime de l'art. 50 du statut.\nL'appelante pr\u00e9tend que son brevet \u00e9tait d\u00e9fectueux ou inop\u00e9rant en raison du fait qu'elle n'avait pas revendiqu\u00e9 ce qu'elle avait le droit de revendiquer et que cette erreur a \u00e9t\u00e9 commise par m\u00e9prise. L'appelante croyait que pour se conformer \u00e0 l'art. 41(1) de la Loi sur les Brevets tout ce qui \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire \u00e9tait que la revendication du produit d\u00e9pende de la revendication du proc\u00e9d\u00e9 au moyen duquel la substance pouvait \u00eatre pr\u00e9par\u00e9e, et il ne fut pas r\u00e9alis\u00e9 qu'une revendication pour un produit sp\u00e9cifique devait d\u00e9pendre d'une revendication du proc\u00e9d\u00e9 d\u00e9limitant sp\u00e9cifiquement la production de cette substance. La question \u00e0 \u00eatre d\u00e9termin\u00e9e \u00e9tait donc de savoir si l'erreur all\u00e9gu\u00e9e \u00e9tait une erreur dans le sens de l'art. 50 du statut. Cet article traite seulement d'un brevet qui est d\u00e9fectueux ou inop\u00e9rant. II envisage l'existence d'un brevet valide qui requiert red\u00e9livrance pour devenir compl\u00e8tement effectif et op\u00e9rant. Dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, le brevet dont on recherche la red\u00e9livrance a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 \u00eatre invalide par cette Cour (voir p. 189). Bien plus, en assumant, sans le d\u00e9cider, qu'une erreur de droit peut constituer une erreur de la sorte qui est envisag\u00e9e par l'art. 50, l'article ne peut entrer en jeu que si le brevet\u00e9 peut satisfaire le Commissaire que, \u00e0 cause de son erreur, le brevet ne repr\u00e9sente pas ce que l'inventeur avait vraiment l'intention de couvrir et d'obtenir. L'appelante n'a pas rencontr\u00e9 cette exigence. L'erreur que l'on all\u00e8gue est le d\u00e9faut, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la loi telle qu'elle \u00e9tait alors comprise, d'appr\u00e9cier qu'une revendication de proc\u00e9d\u00e9 de la sorte dont il est question ne serait pas suffisante pour supporter la revendication du produit selon les exigences de l'art. 41(1) du statut. Une telle erreur ne tombe pas sous l'art. 50 du statut.\nAPPEL d'un jugement du Juge Thurlow de la Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier du Canada[1] , confirmant une d\u00e9cision du Commissaire des Brevets. Appel rejet\u00e9.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Thurlow J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada[2], affirming a decision of the Commissioner of Patents. Appeal dismissed.\nChristopher Robinson, Q.C., and James D. Kokonis, for the appellant. G. W. Ainslie, for the respondent.\nI. Goldsmith, for the intervenant.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of Thurlow J. in the Exchequer Court[3] , which dismissed an appeal by the appellant from the refusal by the respondent to reissue Canadian Patent No. 582,623 which had been granted to the appellant on September 1, 1959.\nOn July 15, 1960, the appellant and Hoechst Pharmaceuticals of Canada Limited brought an action against Gilbert & Company, Gilbert Surgical Supply Co. Limited and Jules R. Gilbert Limited claiming infringement of this and several other patents. The last named company is an intervenant in the present appeal. The action was dismissed in the Exchequer Court by Thurlow J., and an appeal to this Court[4] from that judgment was dismissed on December 14, 1965.\nThe reasons for judgment in this Court, delivered by my brother Hall describe the nature of the invention in respect of which Patent No. 582,623 and the other patents involved in the case were granted, and the legal issue involved, as follows:\nAll the patents relate to defined new sulfonyl ureas, each patent claiming a different process of producing them. Each of the processes produces the new substances by known methods from known materials, with the result that the patentability of the process depends on the possession of unexpected utility by the new substances produced. The unexpected utility stated in the patents is the capacity of lowering blood sugar levels, this being referred to as hypoglycemic activity. The process in each patent is claimed in claim 1 in relation to the production of all the new sulfonyl ureas. Each patent contains a claim (claim 10 in all but the last patent and claim 13 in the last patent) to a specific new sulfonyl urea, tolbutamide, whenever obtained by the process claimed in claim 1 of the patent. It is upon this claim to tolbutamide in each patent that the appellant founded its action for infringement.\nIt is conceded that tolbutamide, standing by itself, could have been the subject matter of a valid patent if claimed as such when prepared or produced by the methods or processes of manufacture particularly described and claimed in the patent or by their obvious chemical equivalent. It possessed the previously undiscovered useful quality as defined in Re May & Baker Ltd. and Ciba Limited, 65 R.P.C. 255 and adopted by this Court in Commissioner of Patents v. Ciba, (1959) S.C.R. 378. However, the respondents say that the process claims in each of the patents in question are invalid as being too broad in their terms, and, in consequence, the claim to the substance tolbutamide cannot stand for that reason.\nHis conclusion is stated as follows:\nIn challenging the validity of the patents in question, counsel for the respondents put his case upon the footing that no one could obtain a valid patent for an unproved and untested hypothesis in an uncharted field. This is what the appellant has tried to do in claim 1 of each of the patents. It has sought to cover, in the words of Thurlow J., \"every mathematically conceivable sulphonyl urea of the class\" and has consequently overclaimed, and, in so doing, invalidated claim 1 in each patent.\nHe then went on to hold, applying the decisions of this Court in C. H. Boehringer Sohn v. Bell-Craig Limited[5] and Commissioner of Patents v. Winthrop Chemical Company Incorporated[6] , that the claims to the product tolbutamide (claim 10 in the patent now in question) fell because they could not stand except upon the foundation of a valid process claim, which did not exist.\nPrior to the delivery of the judgment of Thurlow J. in its infringement action, the appellant, in August 1963, had petitioned for the issue of a new patent, and had surrendered Patent No. 582,623. The petition was based upon s. 50 of the Patent Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 203, which provides as follows:\n50. (1) Whenever any patent is deemed defective or inoperative by reason of insufficient description or specification, or by reason of the patentee claiming more or less than he had a right to claim as new, but at the same time it appears that the error arose from inadvertence, accident or mistake, without any fraudulent or deceptive intention, the Commissioner may, upon the surrender of such patent within four years from its date and the payment of the further fee hereinafter provided, cause a new patent, in accordance with an amended description and specification made by such patentee, to be issued to him for the same invention for the then unexpired term for which the original patent was granted.\n(2) Such surrender takes effect only upon the issue of the new patent, and such new patent and the amended description and specification have the same effect in law, on the trial of any action thereafter commenced for any cause subsequently accruing, as if such amended description and specification had been originally filed in their corrected form before the issue of the original patent, but in so far as the claims of the original and reissued patents are identical such surrender does not affect any action pending at the time of reissue nor abate any cause of action then existing, and the reissued patent to the extent that its claims are identical with the original patent constitutes a continuation thereof and has effect continuously from the date of the original patent. (3) The Commissioner may entertain separate applications and cause patents to be issued for distinct and separate parts of the invention patented, upon payment of the fee for a reissue for each of such reissued patents.\nThe relevant portions of the petition are as follows:\n1. THAT Your Petitioner is the patentee of Patent No. 582,623 granted on September 1st 1959, for an invention entitled MANUFACTURE OF NEW SULPHONYL-UREAS.\n2. THAT the said Patent is deemed defective or inoperative by reason of the patentee having claimed more or less than he had a right to claim as new.\n3. THAT the respects in which the patent is deemed defective or inoperative are as follows:\nClaims 1, 3 and 4 of the patent cover the production of new compounds of a general formula in which certain substituents are not exhaustively defined.\nThe patent contained claims directed to the production of the new compounds when prepared by the process of claim 1 and to certain specific products when prepared by the process of claim 1 but did not contain claims to specific products when prepared by specific processes.\n4. THAT the error arose from inadvertence, accident or mistake, without any fraudulent or deceptive intention in the following manner: Applicant on the advice of his attorneys believed at the time the application was pending that for compliance with Section 41(1) all that was required was that a product claim be dependent on a process claim by means of which the specific claimed substance could be prepared, whereas on March 21, 1962, it was pronounced in a judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada that for compliance with Section 41(1) a claim covering a specific product should be dependent on a process claim which defines specifically the production of that substance.\nTHAT at the time the application was pending, applicant also believed that for the production of a medical substance, broad terms of theoretically unlimited scope would not result in any defect in the claims, whereas following a judgment in the Exchequer Court of Canada on March 21, 1962, it became apparent that the validity of such claims was in doubt.\n5. THAT knowledge of the new facts in the light of which the new claims have been framed was obtained by Your Petitioner on or about April 1962 when the fact and effect of the said judgments of the Exchequer Cour was communicated to Your Petitioner by its Canadian patent agents, whereupon the specification of the Patent was reviewed carefully for the presence of these and other defects.\nIn the petition, the appellant sought to add five new claims to the patent, as previously issued. Three of these purported to restrict the substituent group of the general formula. The other two contained a specific claim for the substance tolbutamide and for a specific process for its preparation. The appellant did not seek to make any change in the original disclosure, nor to abandon any of the claims contained in the patent as originally issued. In fact, as has already been noted, the appellant persisted in its infringement action, notwithstanding the filing of the petition.\nThe petition was refused by the respondent. The material portions of his decision are as follows:\nCareful consideration has been given to the admissibility of this reissue application for prosecution in the Office.\nWhether an application for reissue is acceptable for prosecution before the Office depends on the reasons given in the petition for wanting to correct what is said to be the defect or inoperativeness of the patent.\nSection 50 of the Patent Act is the governing section. The reasons for reissue are insufficiency of description or specification or claiming more or less than what the patentee had the right to claim. I do not believe that the patentee in this case can rightly invoke any of these reasons.\nIn addition to the reasons the section is conditional on certain circumstances which occurred or were present at the time of issue. The error must have arisen from inadvertence, accident or mistake at that time.\nHere there was no inadvertence, accident or mistake at the time of issuing the patent. The applicant was satisfied to obtain his patent with claims submitted and was satisfied on the advice of his agent that the provisions of section 41 subsection 1 has been complied with. There was no defect that the applicant had in mind and failed through inadvertence to correct, (1936 S.C.R. 649 at page 661 Northern Electric Company Limited v. Photo Sound Corporation). It is not enough that an invention might have been claimed in the original patent because it was suggested or indicated in the specification. It must appear from the face of the instrument that what is covered by the reissue was intended to have been covered and secured by the original, (In re Sawyer 624 O.G. 960, 81 USPQ 374, Decisions of the Commissioner 1949 at page 343).\nI do not believe that a change in the legislation or a different interpretation of the legislation was ever contemplated to be a reason for reissue. In this case the courts interpreted the sufficiency of the claims in a patent in a manner different from the generally accepted views of the patent agents and patentees, thereby creating a situation which did not exist at the time of issue of the original patent.\nMy ruling is that the present application for reissue cannot be entertained.\nFrom this refusal, the appellant appealed to the Exchequer Court[7] . The respondent contested the right of the appellant to appeal the respondent's decision under s. 50, contending that the Court was without jurisdiction to hear it. Thurlow J., in view of his decision on the merits of the appeal, found it unnecessary finally to determine this point, though stating that he was inclined to the view that a right of appeal did exist. The relevant section of the Patent Act is s. 44, which provides as follows:\n44. Every person who has failed to obtain a patent by reason of a refusal or objection of the Commissioner to grant it may, at any time within six months after notice as provided for in sections 42 and 43 has been mailed, appeal from the decision of the Commissioner to the Exchequer Court and that Court has exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine such appeal.\nSection 43 is not relevant in relation to this issue. Section 42 reads as follows:\n42. Whenever the Commissioner is satisfied that the applicant is not by law entitled to be granted a patent he shall refuse the application and, by registered letter addressed to the applicant or his registered agent, notify such applicant of such refusal and of the ground or reason therefor.\nIt was the contention of the respondent that, when these sections are read together, it cannot be contemplated that s. 44 provided for a right of appeal in respect of the refusal by the Commissioner of Patents to issue a new patent under s. 50. It was submitted that an application under s. 50 was not the kind of application contemplated by s. 42. Reliance was placed on the definition of an \"applicant\" in s. 2(a) of the Act, i.e.:\n2. (a) \"applicant\" includes an inventor and the legal representatives of an applicant or inventor;\nas indicating that a patentee, surrendering his patent and seeking the granting of a new patent, was not an applicant within the meaning of s. 42.\nIt should be observed, however, that the definition of \"applicant\" in s. 2(a) is not an exclusive one, and that the word \"application\", as defined in s. 2(c) of the Patent Rules, means, \"except in sections 96 to 116, an application for a patent or an application for a reissue of a patent\".\nSection 12(2) of the Act provides that any rule or regulation made by the Governor in Council is of the same force and effect as if it had been enacted in the Act.\nIn the light of these circumstances, in my opinion the wording of s. 44 of the Act permits an appeal in cases coming within s. 50.\nThis being so, it is necessary to consider the refusal by the respondent of the appellant's petition upon the merits.\nI interpret the reasons for that refusal as being twofold:\n1. That the appellant could not rightly invoke any of the reasons justifying the reissue of a patent under s. 50, i.e., insufficiency of description or specification or the claiming of more or less than the appellant had the right to claim.\n2. In any event there had been no inadvertence, accident or mistake causing the alleged error.\nOn the appeal from the decision of the respondent, pleadings were ordered and the parties agreed upon a statement of facts. Paragraph 4 of the statement reads as follows:\n4. The parties hereto agree that if this Honourable Court should find:\n(a) that an appeal lies from the ruling by the Respondent, and\n(b) that the error in relation to Patent No. 582,623 arose from inadvertence, accident or mistake without any fraudulent or deceptive intention,\nthen the application for reissue should be referred back to the Respondent for further consideration and, inter alia, for consideration as to whether the amended specification attached to the petition for reissue is for the same invention as the said Patent No. 582,623.\nHaving reached the conclusion that an appeal did lie to the Exchequer Court, I propose to consider the issue raised in subpara.' (b) of para. 4 above.\nIt is clear from the fact that in the petition for reissue no change was made in the disclosure, and no claims previously made were abandoned, that the appellant did not allege error, within s. 50, by reason of insufficiency of description or specification or by reason of its having claimed more than it had a right to claim. It is also clear from the petition that the appellant did not allege that the error arose from inadvertence or accident.\nWhat the appellant claims, therefore, is that its patent was defective or inoperative by reason of its not having claimed that which it had a right to claim and that such error arose from mistake.\nThe mistake which is relied upon is that the appellant, on the advice of its attorneys, believed that to comply with s. 41(1) of the Patent Act all that was necessary was that a product claim be dependent on a claim for a process by means of which the substance could be prepared and it was not realized that a claim for a specific product should be dependent upon a process claim specifically defining the production of that substance. This, it is claimed, was not discovered until the reasons for judgment of the Exchequer Court in Boehringer v. Bell-Craig[8] were issued.\nIt is also claimed that, prior to that time, the appellant believed that, for the production of a medical substance, broad terms of theoretically unlimited scope would not result in any defect in the claims.\nIn essence what the appellant is saying is that the appellant's attorneys made a mistake of law in respect of the product tolbutamide in having failed to make a process claim specifically defining the production of that substance. The question to be determined is, therefore, whether that alleged mistake is a mistake within the meaning of s. 50.\nCounsel for the appellant pointed out that the reissue provision of the Patent Act is drawn from legislation in the United States. The American provision is similar to that in Canada, subject, however, to some material differences. The word \"deemed\" does not appear in the American statute. Instead of the words \"defective or inoperative\" it uses the words \"inoperative or invalid\". It does not refer to a patentee claiming less than he had a right to claim. Furthermore, where the required conditions exist, it provides that the Commissioner \"shall\" cause a patent to be reissued, whereas our Act uses the word \"may\".\nIn the result, the American statute requires the Commissioner to reissue a patent, in the events defined, even in cases where the initial patent is invalid. The Canadian Act creates a discretion, and only in cases where the initial patent is \"deemed defective or inoperative\".\nThe first Canadian Patent Act, that of the Province of Canada, 12 Vict., c. 24, did use the words \"inoperative or invalid\". The forerunner of the present s. 50, which uses the words \"defective or inoperative\", is found in s. 19 of the Statutes of Canada, 1869.\nThe view of the Supreme Court of the United States regarding the purpose of the American provision as to reissue was stated as being \"to provide that kind of relief which courts of equity have always given in cases of clear accident and mistake in the drawing up of written instruments\". Mahn v. Harwood[9] . This statement was cited, with approval, in Sontag Chain Stores Co. v. National Nut Company of California[10] .\nUsed in this sense, the word \"mistake\" means that a written instrument does not accord with the true intention of the party who prepared it. A person relying upon a mistake under s. 50 would have to establish that the patent which was issued did not accurately express the inventor's intention with respect to the description or specification of the invention or with respect to the scope of the claimswhich he made. This view appears to me to coincide with that expressed by Chief Justice Duff, in relation to the word \"inadvertence\" in Northern Electric Company Ltd. v. Photo Sound Corporation[11] , cited by the respondent in his reasons for the refusal of the appellant's petition.\nIn General Radio Co. v. Allen B. DuMont Laboratories, Inc.[12] , the Circuit Court of Appeals, Third Circuit, held that the failure of the patent applicants to foresee that the application was based upon an error of judgment by the patentee's solicitors in the drafting of the claims.\nThe appellant relied upon the reasoning of the Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit, in the case of Moist Cold Refrigerator Co. v. Lou Johnson Co.[13] . In that case the Court held that the failure of the patent applicants to foresee that the original patent would be declared invalid as functional was an error through \"inadvertence or mistake\" where the applicant drafted claims in good faith, without intent to cover any means of producing the result, and where the functional nature of the claims was a very close question.\nThe Court pointed out that in s. 251 of the Patent Act of 1952, governing the reissue of patents, the words \"inadvertence, accident or mistake\" had been deleted, but held that the test as to the type of error required remained the same as before.\nTwo points should be noted in respect of this decision. The first is that in this case a reissue had been granted in respect of a patent which had been held to be invalid. As has been pointed out earlier, the American statute in terms permits the reissue of an invalid patent in certain specified circumstances. The Canadian Act, however, does not so provide. Section 50 deals only with a patent which is defective or inoperative. In my opinion it contemplates the existence of a valid patent which requires reissue in order to become fully effective and operative. In the present case, in so far as the substance tolbutamide is concerned, the patent for which reissue is sought has been held by this Court to be invalid.\nThe second point is that, while the Court considered an error on a question of law could be one which could be corrected by reissue if it arose through inadvertence or mistake, the test applied does not actually depart significantly from that defined by the Supreme Court of the United States in the cases previously cited. The Court did find on the evidence that the patentee's intent was to take proper steps only to protect its invention and not to cover any and all means of producing the result. Its failure to accomplish that intent resulted from a mistake in framing its claims so as not to render them functional in character within the legal requirements and the earlier decision that they had not done so was a close question.\nThe learned trial judge, in the present case, left open the question as to whether inadvertence, accident or mistake in relation to a question of law could come within s. 50. He was inclined to the view that such cases might arise.\nIt is not necessary to express a final view with respect to that question in the present case. Assuming, without deciding, that a mistake of law could constitute that kind of mistake which is contemplated by s. 50, in my opinion the section can only operate if the patentee can satisfy the Commissioner that, because of his mistake, the patent fails to represent that which the inventor truly intended to have been covered and secured by it. I do not think that the appellant has met that test.\nThe parties to this appeal agreed to the following stated facts:\n(a) Process claims 1 and 2 in Patent No. 582,623, to which claims 3 to 19 inclusive refer, are claims to processes for the manufacture of a large class of substances, and the number of mathematically conceivable substances embraced in the class defined in claims 1 and 2 is infinite.\n(b) Claims 1 and 2 do not state specifically the starting materials from which tolbutamide and the other specific substances defined in claims 10 to 19 inclusive may be made. (c) The disclosure in Patent No. 582,623 does not purport to be one of an invention of tolbutamide alone, or of any of the other specific substances defined in claims 10 to 19 and a process or processes for their preparation, but on the contrary, relates to a class of sulphonyl ureas of which tolbutamide and the other specific substances defined in claims 10 to 19 are members; and the disclosure proceeds to outline in general terms the methods by which ureas of the class may be produced, and asserts utility for the substances of the class. Tolbutamide and the other specific substances defined in certain of the claims are mentioned from time to time in the disclosure as examples, but not until one reaches claims 10 to 19 is there any indication that the invention is concerned with anything but a whole class of substances and general methods of producing them.\n(d) The method used in process claims 1 and 2 was not new, nor were the starting materials which were used new.\n(e) The great bulk of conceivable substances embraced within the class defined in claims 1 and 2 have not, in fact, been produced or tested and nothing is, in fact, known of what their pharmacological effects or usefulness may be; pharmacological effects of new and untried substances are not generally predictable or, if predictable at all, are not predictable to any great extent.\n(f) It is highly improbable that all, or substantially all, of the infinitely large class of substances produced by processes within the scope of claims 1 and 2 have either the blood sugar lowering activity to a useful extent or the freedom from toxicity or harmful side effects necessary to render them useful; and it cannot be predicted that all or substantially all of the substances produced by the process claimed in claim 1 have advantages for lowering and controlling the blood sugar level of patients suffering from diseases such as diabetes, over the known methods of (1) dieting, and (2) the administration of insulin.\nThere is the further fact that the petition for reissue made no change in the disclosure and abandoned none of the claims contained in the patent originally issued.\nIn the light of these facts, it would appear to me that the conclusion of the learned trial judge with respect to claims 1, 3 and 4, referred to in the appellant's petition for reissue, is fully warranted.\nI should say a word, however, with respect to what was put forward as an explanation of the alleged error in claims 1, 3 and 4. The Commissioner plainly did not accept it. The explanation was that the alleged error arose through inadvertence, accident or mistake in that at the time the application was pending the applicant believed that for the production of a medical substance broad terms of theoretically unlimited scope would not result in any defect in the claims whereas after a judgment of this Court it became apparent that the validity of such claims was in doubt. Assuming this:to be true (which is a matter of some difficulty in view of the fact that the May & Baker case had already been decided and had been considered and in some respects adopted in this country in Commissioner of Patents v. Ciba, (1959) S.C.R. 378) I do not see how the Commissioner could have been expected to accept it as showing that the alleged failure to define certain substituents exhaustively arose from inadvertence, accident or mistake for it shows on its face that the applicants knew their alleged invention was limited to substituents that required to be more exhaustively defined but refrained from so defining them not by inadvertence, accident or mistake but deliberately so as to claim and thus get a monopoly under the statute on something which on the admitted facts they had not invented and must have known they had not invented and which was not in fact an invention at all. This is not a case of the applicants having claimed more than they were entitled to claim as new through inadvertence, accident or mistake but one of their having deliberately set out to monopolize what was for the most part an unexplored field of organic chemistry so as to prevent others during the life of the patent from exercising their right to search in that field for, and if successful to put on the market, new substances which might turn out to be as useful or more useful than the several specific substances in that field which the applicants had found to be useful.\nThe claim to the substance, tolbutamide, claim 10, is one which falls within the requirements of s. 41(1) of the Patent Act, which provides:\n41.(1) In the case of inventions relating to substances prepared or produced by chemical processes and intended for food or medicine, the specification shall not include claims for the substance itself, except when prepared or produced by the methods or processes of manufacture particularly described and claimed or by their obvious chemical equivalents.\nThe process claim relied upon for compliance with this subsection was claim 1. There is no suggestion in the petition that the appellant had intended to include in its original patent a claim of the kind defined in the new claim 23 specifically defining the production of tolbutamide. It is clear that judgment was exercised and a decision reached to rely upon the process claim which is claim 1, which, as already noted, was a claim described by Thurlow J. in the infringement action and adopted by this Court as seeking to cover \"every mathematically conceivable sulphonyl urea of the class\".\nThere was, therefore, no mistake in the sense that the original patent failed to represent the true intent of the appellant. The mistake which is alleged is a failure, in the light of existing understanding of the law, to appreciate that a process claim of this kind would not be sufficient to support the claim to the product tolbutamide under the requirements of s. 41(1) I do not think that a mistake of that kind falls within s. 50. Even if the Moist Cold Refrigerator Co. case were to be accepted as an accurate statement of the law in Canada in so far as a mistake of law is concerned, which I do not necessarily accept, the present case would not fall within it since here the appellant deliberately elected to make a process claim in the widest possible terms and had no intention of restricting its invention solely to the production of tolbutamide.\nNor do I agree that the decision of Thurlow J. in C. H. Boehringer Sohn v. Bell-Craig Limited, supra, could be regarded as being an unexpected change of view as to the state of the law. This Court in Commissioner of Patents v. Winthrop Chemical Co. Inc., supra, had held that a claim for a substance alone could not be entertained if it was of the kind defined in s. 41(1) and that the applicant must describe in his specification the method or process by which the substance is prepared or produced and claim such process.\nThe English decision of May v. Baker[14] , which had been approved by Thorson P., [1956-1960] Ex. C.R. 142, and by this Court, [1959] S.C.R. 378, in relation to one aspect in Commissioner of Patents v. Ciba, had dealt with a broad process claim of the kind made in claim 1 and had held, to quote from the headnote:\nThat although the two named thiazoles were of considerable therapeutic value, there was no evidence that this was true of any other derivatives covered by the claims, and\nThat accordingly the patent was bad for want of subject matter since the claims covered substances which were not useful.\nAt the very least, this decision constituted a warning that there might be doubt as to the validity of claim 1 upon which, under s. 41(1), the appellant elected to rely in claiming the substance tolbutamide.\nIn the Boehringer case this Court held that an invalid process claim could not support a claim to a substance under s. 41(1), and this was repeated in the decision in the infringement action in relation to claim 10 of the patent under consideration here. Such a conclusion merely stated what I think was implicit in the Winthrop case. In the light of the foregoing, I think there was ample justification for the exercise by the Commissioner under s. 50 of his discretion in the manner which he did. He was sustained in his decision by the judgment in the Court below, and in my opinion his decision should not be disturbed by this Court. It is my view that this appeal should be dismissed with costs to be paid by the appellant to the respondent.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Smart & Biggar, Ottawa.\nSolicitor for the respondent: E.

The evidence included evidence of breathalizer tests. The accused was not told that he was under arrest until after the tests had been taken. When he was so informed, he was allowed to place a telephone call to his solicitor. When this call proved abortive, he was refused permission to make a second call to obtain legal assistance. His appeal by way of a stated case was allowed on the ground that the breathalizer evidence should not have been admitted. On appeal by the Crown to the Court of Appeal, the conviction was restored. The accused was granted leave to appeal to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed. Per Taschereau C.J., and Fauteux, Ritchie and Hall JJ.: The refusal by the police to allow the accused to make a second telephone call was not a denial of his right to make \u201chis full answer and defence\u201d within the meaning of s. 709 of the Criminal Code. That section relates solely to the procedure at trial.\nThe accused cannot derive any assistance from s. 2(c)(ii) of the Canadian Bill of Rights, 1960 (Can.), c. 44, which provides that no law of Canada shall be construed or applied so as to deprive a person who has been arrested or detained of the right to retain and instruct counsel without delay. The contention that the mere denial to the accused of his right to retain and instruct counsel without delay of itself automatically nullifies the subsequent proceedings was rejected. Regina v. Steeves, [1964] 1 C.C.C. 266 at 268, adopted.\nThe alternative contention that the evidence of the breathalizer should be ignored, could not be entertained either. The facts submitted for the stated case in no way suggested that the presence of counsel after the tests had been completed could have resulted in his ascertaining any factors which would have affected the admissibility of this evidence. The Magistrate did not see fit to draw the inference that had the accused been informed of the charge against him he would have then and there decided to obtain and instruct counsel, and therefore no question of law based upon that inference arose out of the stated case. Furthermore, the decision that the evidence of the breathalizer tests should be ignored was a decision on a question of law which did not arise out of the stated case and which did not form one of the grounds upon which leave to appeal to this Court was granted.\nIn any event, the evidence of the breathalizer tests was clearly admissible, even if it had been shown that the absence of counsel deprived the accused of being advised of his right to refuse to take the tests.\nPer Spence J.: Under the particular circumstances of this case and on the basis upon which the case was stated and the questions put therein, the accused\u2019s appeal should be dismissed. A Court, upon an appeal by way of stated case upon the questions as put in this case, could not consider the inference that the accused, had he been informed as he ought to have been that he was under arrest, would there and then have determined upon obtaining and instructing counsel.\nDroit criminel\u2014Conduite d\u2019automobile alors que la capacit\u00e9 de le faire est affaiblie\u2014Permission refus\u00e9e de communiquer avec un avocat apr\u00e8s mise en arrestation\u2014\u00abR\u00e9ponse et d\u00e9fense compl\u00e8te\u00bb\u2014Code criminel, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, art. 709(1)\u2014D\u00e9claration canadienne des droits, 1960 (Can.), c. 44, s. 2(e).\nPreuve\u2014Admissibilit\u00e9\u2014\u00c9preuve d\u2019haleine obtenue apr\u00e8s arrestation\u2014Accus\u00e9 non inform\u00e9 pr\u00e9alablement de son arrestation\u2014Permission subs\u00e9quente de t\u00e9l\u00e9phoner \u00e0 son avocat\u2014Permission refus\u00e9e de placer d\u2019autres appels lorsque le premier a \u00e9t\u00e9 sans succ\u00e8s\u2014Est-ce qu\u2019il y a eu contravention de l\u2019art. 2(c)(ii) de la D\u00e9claration canadienne des droits, 1960 (Can.), c. 44\u2014La preuve d\u2019haleine \u00e9tait-elle admissible\u2014Code criminel, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, art. 224.

Appel rejet\u00e9.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1, restoring a conviction. Appeal dismissed.\nE. Patrick Hartt, Q.C., for the appellant.\nW.C. Bowman, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Taschereau C.J. and Fauteux, Ritchie and Hall J.J. was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014This is an appeal brought by leave of this Court from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1 setting aside a judgment of Mr. Justice Haines and ordering that an affirmative answer should be given to the three questions submitted by Magistrate F.W. Bartram, Q.C., in the case stated by him at the request of the appellant\u2019s counsel following the appellant\u2019s conviction of an offence contrary to s. 223 of the Criminal Code.\nAs we are limited on this appeal to the facts stated by the learned Magistrate, I think it desirable to set out the whole of the case stated by him:\n1. On the 5th day of February, 1964, an information was laid under oath before a Justice of the Peace for the County of York by the above named Peter Campbell for that the said James Eaton O\u2019Connor on the 5th day of February, 1964, in the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto, in the County of York, unlawfully did while his ability to drive a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol or a drug, drive a motor vehicle contrary to the Criminal Code.\n2. On the 20th day of February, 1964, the said charge was duly heard before me in the presence of the accused and after hearing the evidence adduced and the submissions made by Counsel on behalf of the Crown and the accused, I found the said James Eaton O\u2019Connor guilty of the said offence and convicted him thereof, but at the request of Counsel for the said James Eaton O\u2019Connor, I state the following case for the consideration of this Honourable Court:\nJames Eaton O\u2019Connor was driving a Dodge motor vehicle south on Weston Road at about 1:20 a.m. on February 5th, 1964, when he was stopped by Constable Graham of the Metropolitan Toronto Police Department. James O\u2019Connor got out of his car and as a result of his observations of Mr. O\u2019Connor, Constable Graham formed the opinion that Mr. O\u2019Connor\u2019s ability to drive a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. Constable Graham placed Mr. O\u2019Connor under arrest on a charge of driving while his ability to drive a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol but did not tell Mr. O\u2019Connor this.\nJames O\u2019Connor was interviewed by Constable Thomas McBrian on February 5th, 1964, at about 1:45 a.m. at the Police Station. As a result of his observations of Mr. O\u2019Connor and the results of tests attempted by Mr. O\u2019Connor for Constable McBrian, Constable McBrian formed the opinion that the accused\u2019s ability to drive a motor vehicle was obviously impaired by alcohol. A breathalyzer test reading of 2.0 parts per thousand blood alcohol was recorded at 2:00 a.m. and at 2:15 a.m. a second breathalyzer test reading of 1.9 parts per thousand blood alcohol was recorded. I found as a fact that Mr. O\u2019Connor was not told that he was going to be charged and did not know that he was under arrest until after the breath tests were taken and he was being placed in a cell for the night. At that time, he requested permission to contact his solicitor. He was allowed to make one telephone call but when he was informed that the solicitor was away, he was refused permission to make a further telephone call to obtain legal assistance. The refusal to telephone was made after the tests were taken.\nCounsel for James Eaton O\u2019Connor desires to question the validity of the said conviction on the ground that it is erroneous in point of law, the questions submitted for the judgment of this Honourable Court being:\n(1) Was I right in holding that the refusal by the police to allow the accused while under arrest to contact a lawyer did not amount to a denial to the accused to make his full answer and defence?\n(2) Was I right in holding that the refusal by the police to allow the accused while under arrest to contact a lawyer did not amount to a denial of natural justice?\n(3) Was I right in convicting the accused under the circumstances when I found as a fact, that he, while under arrest, had been denied the right to contact a lawyer?\nIt is to be noted that no further questions have been submitted by the appellant\u2019s counsel at any stage of these proceedings and that the questions of law upon which the application for leave to appeal to this Court was based were confined to challenging the answers given by the Court of Appeal to these three questions, as indeed the grounds upon which such leave to appeal was granted were also confined.\nI take it from reading the reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice Haines that the negative answer which he gave to the first question posed by the learned Magistrate was based on his having equated the refusal by the police to allow the appellant to make a second telephone call, for the purpose of contacting a lawyer while he was in the cells at the Police Station at 2:15 a.m. with a denial of his right to make \u201chis full answer and defence\u201d within the meaning of s. 709 of the Criminal Code which reads as follows:\n709(1) The prosecutor is entitled personally to conduct his case and the defendant is entitled to make his full answer and defence.\n(2) The prosecutor or defendant as the case may be may examine and cross-examine witnesses personally or by counsel or agent.\n(3) Every witness at a trial in proceedings in which this Part applies shall be examined under oath.\nI think it desirable to dispose of this phase of the matter at the outset and to say that I am in full agreement with Mr. Justice Roach that this section \u201crelates solely to the procedure at trial\u201d and that I accept the statement which he made in the course of the reasons for judgment which he delivered on behalf of the Court of Appeal when he said:\nAt the trial the accused was represented by able, experienced counsel and in the case stated there is no suggestion that any right given to the accused by that section (i.e. s. 709) was withheld from him.\nIn my opinion the questions submitted by the learned Magistrate are to be answered in accordance with the interpretation to be placed on the relevant provisions of the Canadian Bill of Rights which read as follows:\n1. It is hereby recognized and declared that in Canada there have existed and shall continue to exist without discrimination by reason of race, national origin, colour, religion or sex, the following human rights and fundamental freedoms, namely,...\n(b) the right of the individual to equality before the law and the protection of the law;...\n2. Every law of Canada shall, unless it is expressly declared by an Act of the Parliament of Canada that it shall operate notwithstanding the Canadian Bill of Rights, be so construed and applied as not to abrogate, abridge or infringe or to authorize the abrogation, abridgment or infringement of any of the rights or freedoms herein recognized and declared, and in particular, no law of Canada shall be construed or applied so as to...\n(c) deprive a person who has been arrested or detained\n(i) of the right to be informed promptly of the reason for his arrest or detention,\n(ii) of the right to retain and instruct counsel without delay, or...\n(e) deprive a person of the right to a fair hearing in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice for the determination of his rights and obligations;...\nThe italics are my own.\nIn submitting that this appeal should be allowed and the three questions answered in the negative, counsel for the appellant asked that a verdict of acquittal be entered and, in so far as this request is based on the contention that the mere denial to the appellant of his \u201cright to retain and instruct counsel without delay\u201d of itself automatically nullifies the subsequent proceedings, I reject it. In this regard I adopt the view expressed by Ilsley C.J. in Regina v. Steeves[2], where he said:\nNor, in my opinion, is there any general rule that if a person who has been arrested has been deprived by the police of the right to instruct counsel without delay, the charge against that person must be dismissed if he is brought to trial and the accused go forever free.\nReflection on the consequences of such a rule, if it were to exist in, for example, the case of capital murder, will indicate, I think, that the relevant provision of the Canadian Bill of Rights cannot mean that.\nCounsel for the appellant, however, asked in the alternative that the conviction be quashed and \u201cthe matter remitted back to the learned Magistrate to dispose of the case on the other evidence only, ignoring the evidence of the breathalizer\u201d, in accordance with the order made by Haines J.\nOn the facts as stated by the learned Magistrate it is not suggested that the appellant had been deprived of his rights under s. 2(c) (ii) until after he had voluntarily submitted to the two breathalizer tests being administered to him and it is a little difficult to understand the grounds upon which Mr. Justice Haines decided that this evidence should be excluded.\nIn the early stages of his reasons for judgment, the learned judge of first instance observed:\nIt was only after the taking of two breathalizer tests that the accused sought permission to contact his solicitor, and, indeed, it can hardly be gainsaid that the police were under no duty to advise him of his rights in that respect. One might therefore be prompted to conclude that all proceedings taken by the police up to and including the taking of the breath tests were regular and proper, and that the complaints of the accused, if any, must necessarily be confined to subsequent events.\nHowever, on the basis of the facts placed before me it is manifest that from the very first two seemingly obvious rights inherent in an accused person were violated. Mr. O\u2019Connor was not informed of or made aware of the fact that he was under arrest, and further, and more importantly, he was not informed of the charge upon which he was arrested. It was only upon the completion of the breath tests and their analysis that these things were made known to him, and it was upon the acquisition of this knowledge that Mr. O\u2019Connor sought permission to contact counsel. I have no doubt but that had the police fulfilled their very obvious duty in making known to the accused the charge against him at the time of apprehension that he would there and then have determined upon the obtaining and instructing of counsel as was his right under sec. 2(c) (ii) of the Canadian Bill of Rights...\nIn my opinion, therefore, nothing in this case turns on the question of when the attempt to retain and instruct counsel was exercised,...\nIt would appear from this part of his decision that the learned judge was expressing the view that the failure of the police to tell the appellant at the time of his apprehension that he was under arrest or that he was charged with driving his motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired resulted in his being subjected to the breathalizer tests before he had any reason to believe that he was in any need of legal assistance and thus deprived him of his right to retain and instruct counsel before the tests were administered. This interpretation of the judgment, however, appears to me to be inconsistent with what the learned judge later said. After he had expressed the view that there had been a complete violation of the appellant\u2019s rights he then continued:\nAnd here I am not speaking of the initial failure of the police to inform the accused of the offence with which he was charged or of the fact of his arrest. These things of course are as unacceptable as their apparent notion that persons in custody are permitted only one phone call completed or otherwise.\nMy reference for the purposes of deciding this case is directed solely to the conduct of the police in denying to the accused the right to retain and instruct counsel without delay. Inherent in that denial was a denial of the right in the accused to confrontation in fact development at a crucial stage to demonstrate his lack of guilt according to law. Had counsel been present to gather evidence he might possibly have ascertained factors which would have determined the innocence of the accused. For example, and only by way of example, he might have unearthed some physical disability under which the accused laboured which would have pointed to some other explanation than impairment by alcohol. Alternatively, he might have discovered some defect in the breathalizer apparatus and sought the taking of a blood test which would negate the presence of alcohol. As applied to this case, having regard to the materials before me, these things are of course speculation,...\nIf these speculative considerations formed any part of the judge\u2019s reasoning in reaching his conclusions that the breathalizer tests were to be ignored, then I think he was in error in considering them because, in my opinion, the facts submitted in the stated case in no way suggest that the presence of counsel in the Police Station after the tests had been completed at 2:15 a.m. could have resulted in his ascertaining any factors which would have affected the admissibility of this evidence.\nIf, on the other hand, the breathalizer test evidence was excluded on the ground that the appellant was deprived of counsel before the tests were taken by reason of the fact that he was not told of the charge against him when he was apprehended, then any such ruling must be based on the assumption that if he had been given this information \u201che would there and then have determined upon the obtaining and instructing of counsel\u201d. This is an inference which the learned Magistrate did not see fit to draw from the evidence and in my opinion no question of law based upon it arises out of the stated case.\nA judge to whom a stated case is transmitted under s. 734 of the Criminal Code is confined to the questions of law stated by the Magistrate and to any other question of law necessarily arising out of the facts stated, in the sense that no evidence could alter it. This is made plain by McRuer C.J.H.C. in the course of his reasons for judgment in Regina v. C.P.R.[3], where he said:\nOn the argument I had some doubt as to whether I could deal with points of law not stated in the stated case. I have, however, come to the conclusion that since the matter before me is in the nature of an appeal and so stated to be, by s. 734 of the Criminal Code, the respondent is entitled to support the conviction on any matter of law arising out of the stated case as long as no evidence could alter it:...\nThe italics are my own.\nAs I have indicated, I am of opinion that when Mr. Justice Haines decided that the evidence of the breathalizer tests should be ignored, he was deciding a question of law which did not arise out of the stated case and which does not form one of the grounds upon which leave to appeal to this Court was granted.\nIn view, however, of the fact that the question of the admissibility of the evidence of the breathalizer tests was dealt with in both the Courts below, I think it desirable to say that this evidence in my opinion was clearly admissible and even if it had been shown that the absence of the appellant\u2019s lawyer deprived him of being advised of his right to refuse to take the tests, my opinion would be the same having regard to the provisions of s. 224(3) of the Criminal Code which read as follows:\n224(3) In any proceedings under section 222 or 223, the result of a chemical analysis of a sample of the blood, urine, breath or other bodily substance of a person may be admitted in evidence on the issue whether that person was intoxicated or under the influence of a narcotic drug or whether his ability to drive was impaired by alcohol or a drug, notwithstanding that he was not, before he gave the sample, warned that he need not give the sample or that the results of the analysis of the sample might be used in evidence.\nThe italics are my own.\nThis subsection was considered by this Court in Re the Validity of s. 92(4) Of the Vehicle Act 1957 (Sask.)[4] and the general law establishing the admissibility of such evidence was fully reviewed by Mr. Justice Fauteux in the course of his reasons for judgment in the case of Attorney General for Quebec v. Begin[5].\nThe evidence in the present case does not, in my opinion, disclose that the circumstances under which the police refused \u201cto allow the accused while under arrest to contact a lawyer\u201d were such as to in any way deprive him \u201cof the right to a fair hearing in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice\u201d and I am accordingly of opinion that no question arises as to the effect which the Canadian Bill of Rights might have upon such circumstances if they did exist.\nIn view of all the above I would answer each of the questions submitted by the learned Magistrate in the affirmative and thereby confirm the conviction.\nI would therefore dismiss this appeal.\nSPENCE J.:\u2014I have had the privilege of reading the reasons for judgment of my brother Ritchie. I agree that under the particular circumstances in this appeal the appeal must be dismissed.\nI feel, however, that I must limit my concurrence strictly to the basis upon which the case was stated by the learned magistrate and the questions put by him which were as follows:\n(1) Was I right in holding that the refusal by the police to allow the accused while under arrest to contact a lawyer did not amount to a denial to the accused to make his full answer and defence?\n(2) Was I right in holding that the refusal by the police to allow the accused while under arrest to contact a lawyer did not amount to a denial of natural justice?\n(3) Was I right in convicting the accused under the circumstances when I found as a fact, that he, while under arrest, had been denied the right to contact a lawyer?\nI agree, with respect, that Haines J. had no basis upon which he could conclude that the accused \u201cwould there and then have determined upon obtaining and instructing counsel\u201d had he been informed as he ought to have been that he was under arrest on a charge of impaired driving. In my view, such an inference could not be considered by the court upon an appeal by way of stated case upon the questions as put therein. It certainly was not one which could not be altered by evidence. See McRuer C.J.H.C. in Regina v. C.P.R.[6].\nThere may well be cases where the same failure to warn the accused that he is under arrest and to state the charge against him results in the obtaining of evidence which it could not otherwise have been obtained. It is not my view that we are in any way bound in the consideration of such cases by the result in the present appeal.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: E.P.

Ltd. was a trustee for the plaintiffs of a franchise for the distribution of natural gas in the Town of Vulcan, and for damages for conspiracy to acquire for Canadian Western the gas utility plant of the Vulcan Company. The trial judge dismissed the action. On appeal it was held that Canadian Western must hold the franchise as trustee for the Vulcan Company but the dismissal of the conspiracy claim was affirmed. Canadian Western appealed to this Court from the declaration that it was a trustee and the respondents cross appealed from the dismissal of the conspiracy claim.\nCentral Gas Utilities (Vulcan) Ltd., which later became a wholly owned subsidiary of Central Gas Utilities Ltd., was incorporated for the purpose of distributing propane gas in the Town of Vulcan. (The two companies are hereinafter referred to as the Vulcan Company.) In July of 1953 the Vulcan Company entered into an agreement with International Utilities Corporation as the only possible means of keeping going. Under this agreement International took over two options held by the Vulcan Company and also provided it with financial assistance. International also became a substantial minority shareholder of the Vulcan Company and during the subsequent years continued to feed in money to keep the company going. It had one nominee on the company's board of directors and it provided routine management and day-to-day administration.\nFollowing representations made to the provincial government on the part of the Town of Vulcan for service of natural gas, Canadian Western, a subsidiary of International, built a feeder line to the town in 1959. This company also got the franchise for the distribution of natural gas in Vulcan and in three neighbouring municipalities and after lengthy negotiations they bought the propane gas distribution system from the Vulcan Company.\nAfter all this had been done and the arrangements ratified by the town and the Board of Public Utility Commissioners of Alberta, the Vulcan company repudiated the arrangements, their complaint being that Canadian Western should have \u00e1ctively promoted the acquisition of the franchise in the Town of Vulcan for them, and that because of their position they must hold the franchise for the Vulcan Company.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the judgment at trial restored.\nAn examination of the prior negotiations showed that the purchase of the distribution system and the granting of the franchise were the result of hard bargaining at arm's length participated in not only by the two companies involved but by the town and with the knowledge of the Board of Public Utility Commissioners, which eventually approved both the sale and the grant of the franchise. There was no question here of the imposition of the will of the purchaser on a captive company.\nThe relationship between the two companies was not one that prevented Canadian Western from accepting the franchise and buying the distribution system. Canadian Western was not in a fiduciary position in relation to the Vulcan Company. There was no evidence that the former, as a corporate entity, ever undertook the obligations and duties of management of the latter. The control and direction of management of the Vulcan Company remained with its board of directors at all times.\nAPPEAL and CROSS-APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division[1] , allowing in part an appeal from a judgment of Milvain J. Appeal allowed; cross-appeal dismissed.\nGeo. H. Steer, Q.C., and G. A. C. Steer, Q.C., for the defendant, appellant.\nW. A. McGillivray, Q.C., and R. A. Scott, for the plaintiffs, respondents. The judgment of the Court was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014Central Gas Utilities Limited and Central Gas Utilities (Vulcan) Limited sued Canadian Western Natural Gas Company Limited, International Utilities Corporation, H. R. Milner and John Maybin for a declaration that Canadian Western was a trustee for the plaintiffs of a franchise for the distribution of natural gas in the Town of Vulcan, and for damages for conspiracy to acquire for Canadian Western the gas utility plant of the Vulcan Company. The trial judge dismissed the action. On appeal[2] it was held that Canadian Western must hold the franchise as trustee for the Vulcan Company but the dismissal of the conspiracy claim was affirmed.\nCentral Gas Utilities (Vulcan) Limited is a wholly owned subsidiary of Central Gas Utilities Limited. It was incorporated for the purpose of distributing propane gas in the Town of Vulcan. The only other property owned by Central Gas Utilities Limited was a similar distribution system in the Town of Melville, Saskatchewan. It also held an option to buy another small distribution system in British Columbia. Lack of money soon compelled it to give up this option. I will refer from now on to these two companies as the Vulcan Company.\nThe Vulcan Company in July of 1953 entered into an agreement with International Utilities Corporation as the only possible means of keeping going. This agreement is set out in full in the reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice Milvain at trial[3] . I will here attempt only a summary of the agreement and a statement of the reasons why it was made.\nUnder this agreement International Utilities took over two options held by the Vulcan Company and reimbursed that company for its deposits. These options were about to expire and would have required payment of $135,000 and $402,300 within a short time. The Vulcan Company because of lack of money could not possibly have taken them up.\nThe other main purpose of the agreement was to provide financial assistance to the Vulcan Company. International guaranteed an existing bank loan of $21,500. It made an immediate loan of $50,000 to be applied on current liabilities and it promised that from time to time it would, in its discretion, make further loans as they were needed.\nInternational also bought from one L. B. Gibson, who was a party to the agreement and a promoter of the company, 159,470 common shares of the Vulcan Company, which gave International approximately one-third of the voting power.\nAt the time when this agreement was made the Vulcan Company was insolvent. Its assets were the two distribution systems in the Towns of Vulcan and Melville. The consolidated financial statement for the year ending September 30, 1952, showed current assets of $4,123.35 and current liabilities of $163,519.84. In October 1952, the company borrowed $75,000 on the security of a 120-day debenture. In January 1953, it borrowed $200,000 on the security of another debenture. After a capital reorganization, the company made a public issue of 750,000 of its common shares but sold only 300,000 and realized the sum of $300,000. What it realized was applied to pay off the secured indebtedness. A financial statement dated May 31, 1953 shows current assets of $19,769.72 and current liabilities of $55,045.70.\nThe evidence is that it was impossible for the company to raise money on any public capital markets. Such efforts had been made and had failed. If the financing agreement between the company and International had not been made in July of 1953, the company would not have long survived.\nThe agreement also provided that Gibson would resign as a director and officer of the Vulcan Company in favour of a nominee of International. This was also done and one Austin Brownie became a director and president of the Vulcan Company from 1953 until his death in January of 1956. He was succeeded in this office by the defendant H. R. Milner, who remained in that position until 1959. This agreement, pursuant to its terms, had to be submitted to the shareholders. This was done and the shareholders ratified the agreement.\nCanadian Western is a public utility in the business of producing, purchasing and distributing natural gas in the City of Calgary and a large number of other communities in Southern Alberta. It is a subsidiary of the defendant International Utilities Corporation, which controls a number of other public utilities operating in the Province of Alberta.\nUntil the year 1958 nothing much happened in the Vulcan Company. The operation was routine. Until October 1956 the old manager, Edgar Robinson, remained in office. When he resigned he was replaced by one John Maybin, who was a member of what is called the Administrative Services Division of a number of subsidiaries of International in the Province of Alberta. The sales of propane gas did not expand as had been expected. Compared with other fuels, it was too expensive. The company lost money every year. It never had any working capital and International had to feed in money every year to keep it going. By October 1957 these loans amounted to $190,000. There was, in addition, the bank loan of $21,500 guaranteed by International.\nThe following is a table of the company's current assets, current liabilities and losses, year by year, from 1952 to 1958:\nCurrent Assets\nCurrent Liabilities\nLoss\n1952\n$ 4,123.35\n$163,519.84\n$14,095.33\n1953\n26,475.95\n85,468.40\n82,745.85\n1954\n29,658.87\n145,889.68\n56,297.98\n1955\n38,141.45\n191,510.58\n40,909.80\n1956\n33,039.44\n202,331.27\n19,542.64\n1957\n26,246.00\n211,807.00\n14,319.00\n1958\n22,662.00\n216,241.00\n10,534.00\nCounsel for the Vulcan Company made much of the tight control exercised over the company during this period. The head office was transferred to the head office of Canadian Western. Robinson, until his resignation in 1956 and after that date Maybin, carried on their duties from their desks in the common office. This was an economy measure. The company was in arrears with its rent. Routine administration, such as billing and collecting, was also done in this office at no charge to the Vulcan Company until Robinson left. When Maybin took over the administration a charge of $400 per month was made for these services and accommodation. There is no suggestion anywhere that this charge was excessive. I have no doubt also that Maybin exercised control over the banking arrangements. This was only to be expected when the company was being kept going on steady and increasing loans from International. I can see nothing in this period which puts International or Canadian Western in a fiduciary relation with the Vulcan Company. International was a substantial creditor and shareholder. It had one nominee on the Board of Directors and it provided routine management and day-to-day administration.\nThe year 1958 was a significant year in the relations between the companies. In October of that year an Alberta Gas Trunk Line from Pincher 'Creek to Princess was completed. The Town of Vulcan was forty miles north of this line. If the town was to be served with natural gas, it would be necessary to construct a feeder line from Shaughnessy going through the small municipalities of Barons, Carmangay, Champion, with Vulcan at the end. Canadian Western at first did not think that the three municipalities of Barons, Carmangay and Champion alone would justify the building of the extension. They estimated that they would get approximately 400 customers from these places. Vulcan had 400 potential customers. However, they did conclude late in 1958 that the three municipalities alone would be sufficient to justify the building as far as Champion. There was another fourteen miles to go from Champion to Vulcan and this part of the line would cost approximately $190,000.\nIn 1958, knowing of the construction of the gas trunk line, the Town of Vulcan began to agitate for service of natural gas. They made representations to the provincial government. The Vulcan extension line was built by Canadian Western in 1959 at its own expense. This company also got the franchise for the distribution of natural gas in Vulcan and the other three municipalities and after lengthy negotiations they bought the propane gas distribution system from the Vulcan Company.\nAfter all this had been done and the arrangements ratified by the town and the Board of Public Utility Commissioners of Alberta, the Vulcan Company repudiated the arrangements, their complaint being that Canadian Western should have actively promoted the acquisition of the franchise in the Town of Vulcan for them, and that because of their position they must hold the franchise in trust for the Vulcan Company. In an action against them for specific performance of the agreement for the sale of the Vulcan distribution system, they pleaded this as a defence. They also started an action for a declaration to this effect and also for damages for conspiracy. It is the judgment of the Court of Appeal in this action that is now under appeal. This makes it necessary to examine in some detail the purchase of the distribution system by Canadian Western and the acquisition of the franchise.\nThe position towards the end of 1958 was this. The Vulcan Company had a non-exclusive licence in the town for the distribution of propane gas but not natural gas. When the town granted this licence in 1951 it stated that it was not granting a licence for the distribution of natural gas although when the Vulcan Company installed its propane system, it did so in such a way that it was suitable for the distribution of natural gas.\nThe problem facing everybody was twofold. Who was going to build and finance the construction of a forty-mile extension line costing approximately $900,000 to the Town of Vulcan, and who was going to distribute natural gas in the town? It is obvious that the insolvent company could not finance the extension line and the town was urging its claims to an immediate service.\nAs far as the franchise was concerned there was the same difficulty. An insolvent company unable to build the extension line could have no chance of getting a franchise from any municipal council which was alert to the interests of its citizens. Nevertheless, the claim of the Vulcan Company against Canadian Western is that this company, having brought natural gas to the town limits, could not acquire the franchise and could not purchase the distribution system without holding both in trust for the Vulcan Company. This, in fact, is the effect of the judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nThe problem was never as simple as its statement by the Vulcan Company. There were not merely two competing companies involved. There was a municipality with a mind and interests of its own, and a provincial public utility commission which had to approve all arrangements made for construction, franchises and rates and which had given the town assurance in 1951 that by granting the non-exclusive licence for the distribution of propane gas, its hands would not be tied if, at a later date, it wished to obtain a supply of natural gas from another company. The legal position cannot be in doubt. No one had any claim of right to this franchise. It was wide open to competition, including competition from Canadian Western, unless that Company's relations with the Vulcan Company raised a disability.\nI come now to the offers made by Canadian Western to purchase the distribution system in the Town of Vulcan. The first offer was dated April 10, 1958 and was for $75,000. I am dealing here with the assets in the Town of Vulcan only. The Board of Directors rejected this offer on two grounds. They thought the price was too low, and they also suggested that they might purchase natural gas from Canadian Western and distribute it themselves until such time as the plant in Melville had been disposed of when they might be in a better position to appreciate the true worth of the Vulcan property. The next offer was dated May 7, 1958. It was for $70,000 plus whatever salvage might be realized from the sale of assets not needed for the distribution of natural gas. Again, the Vulcan Company suggested that it should distribute the gas and purchase wholesale from Canadian Western.\nOn April 7, 1958, the town had given first reading to a by-law granting a franchise to Canadian Western. This became known to the Board of Directors when they considered the second offer and they made representations to the Board of Public Utility Commissioners that they were being ignored. The Chairman of the Board stated at this time, in June 1958, that any application for approval of a franchise would be held in abeyance until Vulcan had had a chance to negotiate with Canadian Western. The result of all this was that nothing was done by way of construction of the extension line in the year 1958. It became essential that it be constructed early in 1959 and that plans be made well ahead of time.\nCanadian Western made a third offer on February 11, 1959, offering a price of $105,375. This increased offer had the concurrence of the Town of Vulcan before it was made to forestall any complaint about possible inflation of the figures for a rate base. This offer was subject to these conditions:\n(a) approval by the shareholders not later than March 16, 1959;\n(b) approval by the Board not later than June 29, 1959;\n(c) the acquisition by Canadian Western not later than June 29, 1959, of franchises for the distribution of natural gas in Vulcan and the three other small municipalities.\nThese conditions were not met and the offer lapsed, although it is the one that was subsequently accepted. The reasons for the delay were that the company was still hopeful that it would be able to do its own distribution and purchase gas wholesale. It was also having trouble with the Saskatchewan Power Corporation, which was expropriating the distribution system in Melville and offering what was considered to be a very low price.\nOn March 20, 1959, at a directors' meeting, the lapsed offer was renewed. H. R. Milner resigned as president and director. The directors referred the offer to a shareholders' meeting to be called and they recommended that it be accepted. The shareholders' meeting was held on April 8, 1959, and passed a resolution authorizing the acceptance of the offer. The votes cast numbered 356,220\u2014195,171 in favour, 161,049 against. International voted its own block in favour. Immediately following the shareholders' meeting the directors accepted the offer.\nThe minority group complained to the Board of Public Utility Commissioners. On May 1, 1959, the Board made two orders approving the sale and the execution of a franchise agreement between the town and Canadian Western. The town then passed its by-law to grant the franchise. This was then approved by a vote of the electors, as required by statute, and the franchise agreement was executed on June 8, 1959.\nI have set out these negotiations in some detail because they show that the purchase of the distribution system and the granting of the franchise were the result of hard bargaining at arm's length participated in not only by the two companies involved but by the town and with the knowledge of the Board of Public Utility Commissioners, which eventually approved both the sale and the grant of the franchise. There is no question here of the imposition of the will of the purchaser on a captive company. Any inferiority in the position of the Vulcan Company was not the result of management or control by Canadian Western but came from its total inability to make any contribution towards anything that would bring natural gas to the town. The Board of Vulcan was an independent board, which, when it saw that it could not purchase gas wholesale, sold its assets at a good price\u2014more than double what it would have cost Canadian Western to duplicate the existing system and far higher proportionately than they were able to get in Saskatchewan, and they got this price with the consent of the town and the board, who both knew that this high price would affect the rates. Yet the judgment of the Court of Appeal decides that Canadian Western Natural Gas Company Limited holds the natural gas franchise of the Town of Vulcan as trustee for the Vulcan Company and, subject to reasonable operation charges, is accountable to the Vulcan Company for the profits of the operation of the franchise.\nThe Vulcan Company's argument in support of the judgment of the Court of Appeal was fourfold. The first ground was based on management. The three other grounds were that Canadian Western lulled the shareholders of the Vulcan Company into a false sense of security; that contrary to its duty, it planned the eventual destruction of the Vulcan Company from the outset, and that it took active measures to destroy the company. The last three grounds have been rejected both at trial and on appeal in the dismissal of the conspiracy claim and I do no more here than to repeat the charges and agree with their dismissal.\nTo establish its claim the Vulcan Company must rely on its first ground. It comes down to management and it must be from this that the fiduciary position arises which, according to the Court of Appeal, makes necessary the imposition of the constructive trust. Throughout these reasons I have avoided using the term \"fiduciary relationship\". I have preferred to outline what the relationship was in fact and, in my opinion, it was not a relationship that prevented Canadian Western from accepting the franchise and buying the distribution system.\nI agree with the conclusions of Milvain J. at trial and I quote only the following paragraph from his judgment:\nHowever, there is no evidence that Canadian Western, as a corporate entity, ever undertook the obligations and duties of management. Its board of directors, so far as the evidence goes, never was called upon to make decisions and direct the persons who managed the affairs of Central. It is clear on the evidence that the control and direction of management remained at all times in the board of directors of Central. While this was going on it was only natural that International would continue a careful daily interest in the day-to-day functions of Central. That such should be the case is obvious for two reasons. In the first place, International had an interest as a large shareholder, not as a majority shareholder but as a very large minority one, and as an ever increasing creditor for moneys advanced. In the second place, by virtue of the agreement, Ex. 1, it was provided that further assistance to Central would be made from time to time, only if such met with the opinion of the directors of International. It is common knowledge that International did continue financial assistance so it is obvious and sensible that careful track would be kept of Central's activities. When this is realized, we see the need for detailed communications which make up the bulk of 196 exhibits filed on the trial of this action. Naturally, International and the individuals responsible to it and to them, as individuals, wanted up-to-date reports and the opinions and thoughts of the reporting people. It is natural that many such people were connected in some way with Canadian Western, the inter-company group, and other companies and organizations in which International had an interest. However wide the informational net, it did not embrace Canadian Western as a corporate entity in a fiduciary position, or remove legal control from the Central directors.\nThe dissenting judge in the Court of Appeal also accepted this interpretation of the relationship.\nThe progress of this litigation requires some mention. Canadian Western wrote on July 9 to enquire whether the Vulcan Company intended to perform its contract. Following this letter there were negotiations between the two companies and Canadian Western offered, subject to the approval of the Town of Vulcan, and the Board of Public Utility Commissioners, to assign the franchise to the Vulcan Company and to supply natural gas wholesale to that company. The town refused to approve this settlement. Canadian Western then sued for specific performance of the agreement on August 25, 1959.\nThe defendant in its statement of defence offered to submit to specific performance but only on condition that Canadian Western was a trustee for it. The filing of this defence was a repudiation of the agreement of sale which was an agreement to convey free and clear of all encumbrances. Canadian Western so accepted this defence and discontinued its action. The Vulcan Company then, on September 8, 1959, began its action for its declaration of trust.\nI would allow the appeal with costs both here and in the Court of Appeal and restore the judgment at trial dismissing the action. The Vulcan Company in this Court also cross appealed on its claim for damages for conspiracy. In this it has been unsuccessful throughout. On another branch of the cross-appeal the Vulcan Company asks for a declaration that Canadian Western held the whole Vulcan extension as trustee for it. This claim, of course, fails in view of what I have written. The cross-appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs and judgment at trial dismissing the action restored. Cross-appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Milner, Steer, Dyde, Massie, Layton, Cregan & Macdonnell, Edmonton.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, respondents: Fenerty, Fenerty, McGillivray, Robertson, Prowse, Brennan & Fraser, Calgary.\n[1] (1965), 53 W.W.R. 705.\n[2] (1965), 53 W.W.R. 705.\n[3] (1964), 49 W.W.R. 515.\n"}

These pickets placed a wooden beam across a lane leading from the premises of the corporation in order to prevent a truck from being driven away by the defendant M, an employee of the corporate defendant. When M attempted to run over the obstruction he found that the beam dragged for a short distance and then shot out in front of the truck. On the third such attempt the plaintiff was struck and injured by the flying beam. The trial judge held that the defendant M had acted in a reckless manner, but that the plaintiff had failed to take reasonable precautions for his own safety. Liability was divided equally. On appeal, the action was dismissed. The plaintiff appealed to this Court. J. J. Robinette, Q.C.,and Duncan W. Shaw, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nJ. P.

There is no dispute that the appellant had killed three caribou and had abandoned parts of them which were fit for human consumption. The charge was dismissed by the Magistrate on the ground that the Game Ordinance did not apply to an Eskimo. On an appeal by way of stated case, the dismissal was confirmed for the same reason. The Court of Appeal reversed this finding and convicted the appellant. The appellant was granted leave to appeal to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe Royal Proclamation of 1763, upon which the appellant relied, has no application in the region in which the alleged offence took place.\nThe Game Ordinance, which was in force and which was validly enacted by the Commissioner-in-Council pursuant to powers conferred upon him by the Parliament of Canada, applies to the Eskimos. The caribou which were killed in this case were game within the meaning of the Game Ordinance and the offence here was in abandoning parts thereof suitable for human consumption even if the appellant had the legal right to hunt them for food.\nIn so far as Regina v. Kallooar (1964), 50 W.W.R. 602, and Regina v. Kogogolak (1959), 28 W.W.R. 376, hold that the Game Ordinance does not apply to Indians or Eskimos in the Northwest Territories, they are not good law and must be taken as having been overruled.\nEsquimaux\u2014Droit criminel\u2014Abandon de gibier apte \u00e0 la consommation humaine\u2014Loi sur les Territoires du Nord-Ouest, S.R.C. 1952, c. 331, art. 13\u2014Ordonnance sur le Gibier, O.N.W.T. 1960 (26 Session), c. 2, art. 15(1)(a).\nL'appelant, un Esquimau, a \u00e9t\u00e9 accus\u00e9 d'avoir tu\u00e9 et abandonn\u00e9 du gibier apte \u00e0 la consommation humaine, le tout contrairement \u00e0 l'art. 15(1)(a) de l'Ordonnance sur le Gibier, O.N.W.T. 1960 (26 Sess.), c. 2.

Appel rejet\u00e9.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for the Northwest Territories[2], reversing a judgment of Sissons J. Appeal dismissed. W. G. Morrow, Q.C., and A. E. Williams, for the appellant.\nD. H. Christie, Q.C., and J. M. Bentley, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nHALL J.:\u2014The appellant, an Eskimo, residing at Whale Cove, a settlement on the west coast of Hudson Bay about midway between Churchill and Chesterfield Inlet, was charged under s. 15(1) (a) of the Game Ordinance, being c. 2 of the Ordinances of the Northwest Territories, (1960) Second Session, that he, between the 20th day of July, 1964 and the 31st day of July, 1964 at or near a point two miles from an abandoned cabin on the north shore at the mouth of the Wilson River, Northwest Territories, did kill and abandon game fit for human consumption contrary to s. 15(1) (a) of the Game Ordinance.\nSection 15(1) (a) referred to reads as follows:\n15.(1) No person who has killed, taken or acquired game shall\n(a) abandon any part thereof that is suitable for human consumption;\nThe Game Ordinance was enacted by the Commissioner in Council pursuant to powers confered by s. 13 of the Northwest Territories Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 331. The relevant parts of s. 13 read:\n13. The Commissioner in Council may, subject to the provisions of this Act and any other Act of the Parliament of Canada, make ordinances for the government of the Territories in relation to the following classes of subjects, namely,\n***\n(q) the preservation of game in the Territories;\nBy s. 1 of c. 20 of the Statutes of Canada 1960, s. 14 of the Northwest Territories Act was amended to read:\n(2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) but subject to subsection (3), the Commissioner in Council may make Ordinances for the government of the Territories in relation to the preservation of game in the Territories that are applicable to and in respect of Indians and Eskimos, and Ordinances made by the Commissioner in Council in relation to the preservation of game in the Territories, unless the contrary intention appears therein, are applicable to and in respect of Indians and Eskimos.\n(3) Nothing in subsection (2) shall be construed as authorizing the Commissioner in Council to make Ordinances restricting or prohibiting Indians or Eskimos from hunting for food, on unoccupied Crown lands, game other than game declared by the Governor in Council to be game in danger of becoming extinct.\nand s. 17 was amended by adding thereto the following:\n(2) All laws of general application in force in the Territories are, except where otherwise provided, applicable to and in respect of Eskimos in the Territories.\nActing under s. 14(3) above, the Governor in Council passed an Order in Council on September 14, 1960, reading as follows:\nAT THE GOVERNMENT HOUSE AT OTTAWA\nWEDNESDAY, the 14th day of SEPTEMBER, 1960.\nPRESENT:\nHIS EXCELLENCY THE GOVERNOR GENERAL IN COUNCIL\nHis Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Northern Affairs and National Resources, pursuant to subsection (3) of section 14 of the Northwest Territories Act, is pleased hereby to declare musk-ox, barren-ground caribou and polar bear as game in danger of becoming extinct.\n(Seal)\nCertified to be a true copy.\n(sgd.) D. F. Wall\nAssistant Clerk of the Privy Council.\nCounsel for the appellant made a point that this Order in Council was not referred to in the proceedings before the magistrate. Nothing, however, turns on that fact. The Order in Council was part of the relevant law applicable to the charge whether referred to or not.\nThe charge was heard by P. B. Parker, a police magistrate in and for the Northwest Territories under the provisions of s. 466(b) of the Criminal Code of Canada at Whale Cove aforesaid on February 26 and 27, 1965. Magistrate Parker, holding that he was bound by the decision of Sissons J. in Regina v. Kallooar[3] , dismissed the charge on the ground that the Game Ordinance did not apply to an Eskimo.\nThe Attorney General of Canada applied to Magistrate Parker to state a case under s. 734 of the Criminal Code of Canada. The learned magistrate stated the case which concluded with asking the following question:\nWas I right in holding that the Game Ordinance and particularly Section 15(1) (a) thereof does not apply to Eskimos? The appeal, by way of stated case, was heard by Sissons J. who, adhering to the views expressed by him in Regina v. Kogogolak[4] and in Kallooar answered the question in the affirmative and upheld the dismissal of the charge. Sissons J. in Regina v. Kogogolak had held at p. 384:\nThe Game Ordinance of the Northwest Territories cannot and does not apply to the Eskimos.\nThe Attorney General of Canada appealed by leave to the Court of Appeal for the Northwest Territories. The appeal was heard by the Chief Justice, Parker and McDermid JJ.A. The Court of Appeal[5] reversed Sissons J. and convicted the appellant, remitting the case to the Summary Conviction Court for the purpose of deciding what penalty should be imposed on the appellant. The appellant applied for and was given leave to appeal to this Court from the judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nIt was contended by the appellant that the Royal Proclamation of 1763 applied to Indians and Eskimos in the area in question here and was still in effect notwithstanding the Northwest Territories Act and the Game Ordinance. Sissons J. so held in Kogogolak and in Kallooar. Johnson J.A. in Regina v. Sikyea[6] , whose judgment was adopted in this Court[7] , expressed himself to the contrary. There is no need for any doubt on the point. The Proclamation, insofar as it related to Indians, declared:\nAnd whereas it is just and reasonable, and essential to our Interest, and the security of our Colonies, that the several Nations or Tribes of Indians with whom We are connected, and who live under our Protection, should not be molested or disturbed in the Possession of such Parts of Our Dominions and Territories as, not having been ceded to or purchased by Us, are reserved to them or any of them, as their Hunting Grounds\u2014We do therefore, with the Advice of our Privy Council, declare it to be our Royal Will and Pleasure, that no Governor or Commander in Chief in any of our Colonies of Quebec, East Florida, or West Florida, do presume, upon any Pretence whatever, to grant Warrants of Survey, or pass any Patents for Lands beyond the Bounds of their respective Governments, as described in their Commissions; as also that no Governor or Commander in Chief in any of our other Colonies or Plantations in America do presume for the present, and until our further Pleasure be Known, to grant Warrants of Survey, or pass Patents for any Lands beyond the Heads or Sources of any of the Rivers which fall into the Atlantic Ocean from the West and North West, or upon any Lands whatever, which, not having been ceded to or purchased by Us as aforesaid, are reserved to the said Indians, or any of them.\nAnd We do further declare it to be Our Royal Will and Pleasure, for the present as aforesaid, to reserve under our Sovereignty, Protection, and Dominion, for the use of the said Indians, all the Lands and Territories not included within the Limits of Our Said Three New Governments, or within the Limits of the Territory granted to the Hudson's Bay Company, as also all the Lands and Territories lying to the Westward of the Sources of the Rivers which fall into the Sea from the West and North West as aforesaid; (The italics are mine.)\nThe term \"Indians\" includes Eskimos: Reference as to whether the term \"Indians\" in Head 24 of Section 91 of the British North America Act, 1867, includes Eskimo inhabitants of the Province of Quebec[8] .\nThe Letters Patent granted in 1670 to the Governor and Company of Adventurers of England, trading into Hudson's Bay, gave:\n\u2026unto the said company and their successors the sole trade and commerce of all those seas, straits, bays, rivers, lakes, creeks and sounds in whatsoever latitude they should be, that lay within the entrance of the straits commonly called Hudson's Straits together with all the lands and territories upon the countries, coasts, and confines of the seas, bays, lakes, rivers, creeks, and sounds aforesaid\u2026.\nThe Proclamation specifically excludes territory granted to the Hudson's Bay Company and there can be no question that the region in question was within the area granted to Hudson's Bay Company. Accordingly the Proclamation does not and never did apply in the region in question and the judgments to the contrary are not good law.\nThe substantive question which was fully and ably argued by counsel was whether the Game Ordinance and particularly s. 15(1)(a) thereof apply to Eskimos. In summary, the learned magistrate found as follows as set out in more detail in the stated case:\n(1) That the appellant, an Eskimo, on the 20th day of July and the 31st day of July, 1964, killed three caribou being game within the meaning of the Game Ordinance and he took possession of them and removed the skin and rear parts of two caribou and the tongue of the third.\n(2) That he showed intention to abandon and did abandon the parts of the three caribou he had killed and which he did not take, and that the meat abandoned was at that time fit for human consumption.\nIt was not questioned that the Whale Cove settlement is in the Barren Land region of the Northwest Territories, being a part of Canada under the legislative jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada. Parliament, by s. 13 of the Northwest Territories Act, conferred legislative powers upon the Commissioner in Council to enact laws for the preservation of game in the Territories. The Commissioner in Council enacted the Game Ordinance. Parliament by c. 20 of the Statutes of Canada, 1960, enacted by s. 2 thereof as follows:\nFrom the day on which this Act comes into force, the provisions of the Ordinances entitled\n(a) \"An Ordinance respecting the Preservation of Game in the Northwest Territories\", being chapter 42 of the Revised Ordinances of the Northwest Territories, 1956;\n(b) \"An Ordinance to amend the Game Ordinance\", being chapter 2 of the Ordinances of the Northwest Territories, 1956, 2nd Session;\n(c) \"An Ordinance to amend the Game Ordinance\", being chapter 1 of the Ordinances of the Northwest Territories, 1957, 1st Session;\n(d) \"An Ordinance to amend the Game Ordinance\", being chapter 1 of the Ordinances of the Northwest Territories, 1958, 1st Session; and\n(e) \"An Ordinance to amend the Game Ordinance\", being chapter 4 of the Ordinances of the Northwest Territories, 1959, 1st Session,\nhave the same force and effect in relation to Indians and Eskimos as if on that day they had been re-enacted in the same terms.\nand also provided that:\n(3) Nothing in subsection (2) shall be construed as authorizing the Commissioner in Council to make Ordinances restricting or prohibiting Indians or Eskimos from hunting for food, on unoccupied Crown lands, game other than game declared by the Governor in Council to be game in danger of becoming extinct.\nThe Governor in Council then passed the Order in Council of September 14, 1960 previously quoted, declaring barren-ground caribou as game in danger of becoming extinct.\nThe power of Parliament to enact the Northwest Territories Act and the amendments thereto is not questioned nor is the power of the Commissioner in Council to enact the Game Ordinance. It is not in dispute that the appellant abandoned parts of game as defined in s. 2 of the Game Ordinance then suitable for human consumption. The only factual issue pressed by the appellant was that it had not been shown that the three caribou which he killed and abandoned in part were barren-ground caribou. I have no doubt that this Court can and should take judicial notice of the fact that the caribou in question here were barren-ground caribou. The Whale Cove region is deep in the Barren Lands of Northern Canada and no suggestion is made in any of the literature to which the Court was referred that any caribou other than barren-ground caribou are to be found that far north. In any event, the caribou he killed were game within the meaning of the Game Ordinance and the offence here was in abandoning parts thereof suitable for human consumption even if he had the legal right to hunt them for food.\nI am of opinion that the question put by Magistrate Parker in the case stated by him must be answered in the negative, the conviction of the appellant by the Court of Appeal affirmed and the direction remitting the case to the Summary Conviction Court upheld.\nI think it desirable to say specifically that insofar as Regina v. Kallooar and Regina v. Kogogolak hold that the Game Ordinance does not apply to Indians or Eskimos in the Northwest Territories, they are not good law and must be taken as having been overruled.\nThe appeal should, accordingly, be dismissed.

Mr. Justice Jean, who heard the case at trial, dismissed the principal action and the incidental demand with costs. As to the cross-demand, he annulled the lease entered into by the parties on December 31, 1959, and condemned the cross-defendant to pay to Stroll's Inc., the cross-plaintiff, the sum of $470.80, which is the proportion of the rent from January after the fire which occurred.\nOn December 31, 1959, the respondent, Dame Lily Gorn, leased to the appellant a store bearing civic number 77 St. Catherine St. East, in the City of Montreal.

The respondent, who operated a jewelry business and was engaged in extensive real estate dealings, carried out his business accounting on the accrual basis. His fiscal year ended on January 31 of each year. The taxability of the moneys received from the expropriation was not in issue before this Court. But the year in which the profit became income was disputed. The Minister contended that it was in the taxation year ending January 31, 1956, since the Treasury Board had authorized the payment in February 1955, and payment had been received in May 1955. The taxpayer contended that it was either in the taxation year ending January 31, 1954, since the notice of expropriation by virtue of which the property was deemed to be transferred was served on January 15, 1954; or, alternatively, the taxation year ending January 31, 1955, since the government's formal order of settlement was made and accepted in July 1954. The Exchequer Court annulled and set aside the Minister's reassessment. The Minister appealed to this Court, where the respondent agreed that three minor items, not specifically dealt with by the trial judge should not have been disallowed.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed in part.\nAssuming that ratification of the authority of the government agent to make the settlement was required, such ratification was afforded by the Treasury Board minute of February 1955 (which was during the taxpayer's 1956 taxation year) and, in accordance with the ordinary rules of mandate, it had retroactive effect to July 1954 (which was the date of the offer and which was during the taxpayer's 1955 taxation year). It followed that the respondent, operating on an accrual basis, was bound to treat the profit as having been earned prior to January 31, 1955, and that it was not taxable income in his taxation year ending January 31, 1956.\nRevenu\u2014Imp\u00f4t sur le revenu\u2014Expropriation de terrains par le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral\u2014P\u00e9riode lors de laquelle le contribuable doit rendre compte du profit\u2014Ann\u00e9e d'imposition.\nEn 1952, I'intim\u00e9 avait acquis des terrains qui furent subs\u00e9quemment expropri\u00e9s par le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. L'intim\u00e9, qui \u00e9tait un bijoutier et qui s'occupait beaucoup d'achats et de ventes d'immeubles, se servait du principe de comptabilit\u00e9 d'exercice. Son ann\u00e9e fiscale se terminait le 31 janvier de chaque ann\u00e9e. Il ne fut pas contest\u00e9 devant cette Cour que les argents re\u00e7us en vertu de I'expropriation \u00e9taient taxables. Mais, cependant, I'ann\u00e9e durant laquelle le profit \u00e9tait devenu un revenu fut mise en doute. Le Ministre pr\u00e9tend que c'\u00e9tait durant I'ann\u00e9e d'imposition se terminant le 31 janvier 1956, puisque le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor avait autoris\u00e9 le paiement en f\u00e9vrier 1955 et que ce paiement avait \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7u en mai 1955.

La Cour de I'\u00c9chiquier a annul\u00e9 et mis de c\u00f4t\u00e9 la cotisation du Ministre. Durant I'appel du Ministre devant cette Cour, I'intim\u00e9 a admis que trois item mineurs, qui n'avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 sp\u00e9cifiquement trait\u00e9s par le juge au proc\u00e8s, n'auraient pas d\u00fb avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9savou\u00e9s.\nArr\u00eat: L'appel doit \u00eatre maintenu en partie.\nAssumant qu'une ratification de I'autorit\u00e9 du repr\u00e9sentant du gouvernement d'offrir un r\u00e8glement \u00e9tait requise, une telle ratification se trouve dans les minutes du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor en date de f\u00e9vrier 1955, et, en vertu des r\u00e8gles ordinaires du mandat, cette ratification avait un effet r\u00e9troactif \u00e0 juillet 1954. Il s'ensuit que I'intim\u00e9, qui faisait affaires en vertu du principe de comptabilit\u00e9 d'exercice, devait traiter le profit comme ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenu avant le 31 janvier 1955, et que ce profit n'\u00e9tait pas un revenu taxable de I'ann\u00e9e d'imposition se terminant le 31 janvier 1956.\nAPPEL d'un jugement du Juge Dumoulin de la Cour de I'\u00c9chiquier du Canada[1] , mettant de c\u00f4t\u00e9 la cotisation du Ministre. Appel maintenu en partie. APPEAL from a judgment of Dumoulin J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada[2] , setting aside the Minister's assessment. Appeal allowed in part.\nPaul Ollivier, Q.C., for the appellant.\nPhilip F. Vineberg, Q.C., Norman Genser, Q.C., and S. Phillips, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nABBOTT J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of Mr. Justice Dumoulin of the Exchequer Court[3] allowing the respondent's appeal from an assessment made on March 15, 1962, with respect to the 1956 taxation year of the respondent, whereby a sum of $251,166.59 was added to the respondent's income.\nThe said sum of $251,166.59 consists, for the most part, of profit alleged to have been made by the respondent on the disposition of land (including land acquired by the Crown) and is made up as follows:\nCasual McCauley Realties (See T-4 1956)\nCasual\n$ 4,500.00\nLand profits\u2014507 Parish of St. Laurent\n125,100.3\n\"\n\"\n507 Parish of St. Laurent\n109,406.55\n\"\n\"\n368 Parish of St. Laurent\n3,847.70\n\"\n\"\n25-27 Pointe-Claire\n8,311.98\n$251,166.59\nThe respondent operates a jewelry business in Montreal under the name \"American Watch Company of Canada\". In addition to this business, he was engaged in extensive real estate dealings in 1954 and for some time prior thereto, and in March 1952 had purchased lot 507 in the Parish of St. Laurent. Respondent carried out his business accounting on the accrual basis and was operating on this basis in 1954, 1955 and subsequent years. His fiscal year, accepted by the Department of National Revenue, for the years in question, ended on January 31 of each year, so that his taxation year 1954 ended January 31, 1954, his taxation year 1955 January 31, 1955, and his taxation year 1956 January 31,1956. The chronological order of events with respect to the land expropriated by the Crown and a contiguous parcel sold to the Crown under threat of expropriation, is as follows:\nJanuary 7, 1954\u2014A notice of expropriation dated December 28, 1953, covering part of Lot 507 was deposited at the Montreal Registry Office.\nJanuary 15, 1954\u2014An expropriation notice was served on respondent. This notice specified that the expropriation was made pursuant to the Expropriation Act and that title \"vests in Her Majesty the Queen in the Right of Canada as from the date of deposit of record in the Office of the Registrar of Deeds of a plan and description of the said lands\".\nJuly 13, 1954\u2014A formal offer of settlement in the amount of $318,776 was made to respondent with respect to the expropriated parcel and \"that part of Lot 507 severed by reason of the expropriation\", and covered also all damages arising from the expropriation.\nJuly 14, 1954\u2014Respondent accepted in writing the offer of settlement contained in the letter of July 13.\nMay 13, 1955\u2014Respondent received payment in accordance with the settlement.\nIn the Court below, respondent argued that the moneys received from the disposal of the lands in question were not taxable, but this is no longer in issue. Alternatively, he argued that, if they were taxable, assessment should not have been made for the year 1956, because:\n(a) With respect to the part expropriated, the amount attributable under this portion was taxable at the moment of the transfer of title, which took place on January 7, 1954, in the taxpayer's 1954 taxation year.\n(b) Alternatively, that compensation for all the land taken should, at the latest, be taxable at the time the amount was clearly established, which was in July, 1954, during the taxpayer's 1955 taxation year.\nThe amount of the payment received by respondent in May 1955 was assessed as taxable in his 1956 taxation year. At the hearing before us counsel for the Crown agreed that if it should have been assessed in an earlier year, it was immaterial for the purposes of this appeal whether that year were 1954 or 1955.\nThe principal issue to be determined on this appeal is whether respondent's profit of $234,506.91 with respect to lot 507, was taxable income in his taxation year ending January 31, 1956. The answer to this question depends primarily upon the effect of the two letters of July 13, 1954, and July 14, 1954, above referred to, and I quote them in full.\nYour file No.\nOur file No. Q-1003-71-1\nCanada\nDEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORT\nRoom 222,\n131 St. James S.

Adam\nDear Sirs:\nIn reply to your letter of the 13th instant, I wish to notify you that I accept your formal offer of settlement in the amount of Three Hundred and eighteen thousand seven hundred and seventy-six dollars ($318,776.) in full compensation for all damages arising out of the expropriation of January 7th, 1954 affecting part of my property bearing lot No. 507 Parish of St. Laurent.\nIn view of the expropriation having been filed six months ago, I would appreciate payment within the next sixty days.\nVery truly yours,\n(signed) Ben H. Lechter. On February 11, 1955, payment to respondent of the sum of $318,776 above referred to, was authorized by a Treasury Board Minute, and the amount appears to have been actually paid in May 1955, when notarial deeds of sale and release were executed.\nAppellant's contention is that no taking of land and no agreement of sale is valid until the approval of Treasury Board has been obtained\u2014in this case February 11, 1955\u2014and that in consequence the amount in question only became an account receivable by respondent on that date.\nMr. J. P. Adam, who signed the letter of July 13, 1954, was District Land Agent of the Department of Transport at Montreal. There is no suggestion that he was acting in bad faith or that he was not authorized by his Departmental superiors to write the letter which he did. By his letter of July 14, 1954, respondent accepted the offer contained in the letter of July 13, and he was bound by that acceptance. In fact, settlement was eventually made in the precise amount specified in the two letters and Adam himself signed the notarial deeds of sale and release acting under a power of attorney from the then Minister of Transport.\nAppropriate Treasury Board authority was necessary to make the payment agreed upon and this was forthcoming in due course. Assuming that ratification of the authority of Adam to make the settlement was required, such ratification was afforded by the Treasury Board Minute of February 11, 1955, and, in accordance with the ordinary rules of mandate, it had retroactive effect to July 13, 1954\u2014See Mignault, Droit Civil canadien, vol. 8 at p. 58.\nIt follows, that respondent, operating on an accrual basis, was bound to treat the profit of $234,506.91 on the disposition of part of lot 507, as having been earned prior to January 31, 1955, and that it was not taxable income in his taxation year ending January 31, 1956.\nOne minor point remains. The Minister's assessment of March 15, 1962, in addition to the two items relating to lot 507, included as income of respondent three amounts of $4,500, $3,847.70 and $8,311.98 relating to other properties. No evidence was adduced at the trial with respect to these three items, and they are not dealt with in the judgment below but the assessment was vacated in toto .Counsel for respondent agreed that in the circumstances these three items should not have been disallowed, and that to this extent the appeal should succeed.\nThe appeal is therefore allowed in part, the judgment below varied and the assessment appealed from referred back to the Minister for reconsideration and reassessment on the basis that the sums of $125,100.36 and $109,406.55, being the profit realized by respondent as a result of the sale and expropriation of a part of lot 507 in the Parish of St. Laurent, did not constitute income in the hands of respondent for his taxation year 1956.\nThe respondent is entitled to his costs in this Court.\nAppeal allowed in part, costs to the respondent.\nSolicitor for the appellant: E.

All lumber was delivered before March 29. By a deed of loan dated March 22 and registered March 26, the defendant hypothecated six lots to the intervenant in order to secure a building loan. The plaintiff registered its privilege on May 14 for the sum of $31,906 for materials supplied. On June 14, the defendant was declared bankrupt. On July 11, the intervenant, taking advantage of a giving-in payment clause in the deed of loan, obtained judgment declaring it the owner retroactively to the date of the deed of loan of the hypothecated lots. The plaintiff began an action on June 17 to have its privilege judicially recognized. The trial judge recognized the debt owing to the plaintiff but cancelled the privilege. The Court of Appeal allowed the plaintiff's appeal and restored the privilege. The intervenant appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nPrivil\u00e8ge\u2014Fournisseur de mat\u00e9riaux\u2014Mat\u00e9riaux fournis pour la construction de maisons\u2014Intervention par un tiers ayant fourni des fonds pour la construction\u2014Le privil\u00e8ge est-il cancell\u00e9 par l'intervention\u2014Code Civil, arts. 2013,2013e, 2103.\nPar contrat intervenu entre la compagnie d\u00e9fenderesse et la compagnie demanderesse, cette derni\u00e8re s'engageait \u00e0 fournir \u00e0 la compagnie d\u00e9fenderesse le bois requis pour la construction d'un certain nombre de maisons.

Act, 1867-1960, ss. 91, 92.\nThe National Capital Commission, with the approval of the Governor in Council, and acting under s. 13(1) of the National Capital Act, 1958 (Can.), c. 37, expropriated a farm in the township of Gloucester in the province of Ontario owned by the appellant. It was conceded that the appellant's lands were taken for the purpose of establishing the Green Belt proposed in the Master Plan (Greber) for the development of the National Capital Region. On an application before the Exchequer Court for a special case, it was directed that the following question be tried before the trial of the other questions raised in the action:\n\"Whether, on the special case stated by the parties, the expropriation of the lands of the defendant by the National Capital Commission therein referred to is a nullity because the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada under the British North America Act, 1867 to 1960, does not extend to authorizing the expropriation.\"\nThe trial judge answered the question in the negative. The defendant appealed to this Court. Leave to intervene in this appeal was granted to the Attorney General for Ontario and the Attorney General for Quebec, but the former subsequently withdrew his intervention. Held: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe subject matter of the National Capital Act is the establishment of a region consisting of the seat of the Government of Canada and the defined surrounding area which are formed into a unit to be known as the National Capital Region which is to be developed, conserved and improved \"in order that the nature and character of the seat of the Government of Canada may be in accordance with its national significance\". That subject matter is not referred to in either s. 91 or s. 92 of the British North America Act. Consequently, the sole power rests with Parliament under the preliminary words of s. 91, relative to \"laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada\". It was therefore within the powers of Parliament to authorize the Commission, for the attainment of its objects and purposes as defined in the Act, to make the expropriation of the lands of the appellant.\nDroit constitutionnel\u2014Expropriation d'une terre en vue d'une ceinture de verdure dans la r\u00e9gion de la Capitale nationale\u2014Le Parlement a-t-il l'autorit\u00e9 l\u00e9gislative d'exproprier ainsi\u2014Loi sur la Capitale nationale, 1958 (Can.), c. 37, art. 13(1)\u2014Acte de l'Am\u00e9rique du Nord britannique, 1867 -1960, arts. 91, 92.\nLa Commission de la Capitale nationale, avec l'approbation du gouverneur-en\u2013conseil, et agissant en vertu de l'art. 13(1) de la Loi sur la Capitale nationale, 1958 (Can.), c. 37, a expropri\u00e9 une ferme appartenant \u00e0 l'appelant, dans le canton de Gloucester, province d'Ontario.

Maxwell, Q.C., and G. W. Ainslie, for the respondent.\nG\u00e9rald LeDain, Q.C., for the intervenant, Attorney General for Quebec.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of Gibson J. in the Exchequer Court[3] pronounced on April 28, 1965, answering in the negative the following question which, by order of the President of the Court, had been directed to be tried before the trial of the other questions raised in the action:\nWhether, on the special case stated by the parties, the expropriation of the lands of the defendant by the National Capital Commission therein referred to is a nullity because the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada under the British North America Act, 1867 to 1960, does not extend to authorizing the expropriation.\nOn June 25, 1959, the respondent, with the approval of the Governor in Council, expropriated a farm of 195 acres in the Township of Gloucester in the Province of Ontario owned by the appellant. In so doing the respondent was acting under subs. (1) of s. 13 of the National Capital Act, Statutes of Canada 1958, 7 Elizabeth II, Chap. 37, hereinafter sometimes referred to as \"the Act\", which came into force on February 6, 1959. By information filed in the Exchequer Court on January 31, 1963, the respondent recited the taking of the lands for the purposes of the Act and stated its willingness to pay $200,000 by way of compensation.\nIn his statement of defence filed on October 13, 1964, the appellant asked, firstly, a declaration that the expropriation \"was illegal, null and void because it was beyond the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada to grant to the Plaintiff (the respondent) powers of expropriation for establishing a Green Belt outside the limits of the said City of Ottawa\", secondly, in the alternative, that compensation be awarded to him in the sum of $420,000.\nBy order of the Chief Justice of Canada it was directed that notice of the constitutional question raised in this appeal should be served on the Attorneys General of the Provinces and on the Clerks of the City of Ottawa, the City of Hull, the Township of Nepean and the Township of Gloucester and a date was fixed for the making of applications for leave to intervene.\nBy order of Judson J. made on September 9, 1965, leave to intervene was granted to the Attorney General for Ontario and the Attorney General for Quebec. Subsequently the Attorney General for Ontario withdrew his intervention. Counsel for the Attorney General for Quebec filed a factum and presented a full and helpful argument in support of the appeal. It will be observed that the question which Gibson J. was called upon to decide is limited to whether the expropriation of the appellant's land is a nullity for a single specified reason:\nbecause the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada under the British North America Act, 1867 to 1960, does not extend to authorizing the expropriation.\nThe main ground relied on by counsel who support the appeal is that the power of expropriation which the Act gives to the respondent has been exercised, in the case of the appellant's land, for the imposition upon the use of land within the National Capital Region of controls or restrictions of the nature of zoning regulations contemplated by the Planning Acts passed by the Provinces. It is said, more particularly, that the power has been used for the purpose of the establishment of a \"Green Belt\" in the Region. It is argued that such a use of the power of expropriation is in its nature, character and purpose a use in relation to a matter falling within the classes of subjects assigned exclusively to the Legislatures of the Provinces by the British North America Act and that, consequently, if the National Capital Act purports to confer such a power upon the Commission it is, pro tanto, ultra vires of Parliament.\nIt is conceded by counsel for the respondent, and so stated in their factum, that the appellant's lands were taken for the purpose of establishing the Green Belt proposed in the Master Plan for the development of the National Capital Region. The constitutional question to be determined is whether it is within the powers of Parliament to authorize the establishment of a Green Belt within the National Capital Region.\nThe learned trial judge has made a careful review of the legislative history of the National Capital Act and of the Planning Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 296, and of the development of the Master Plan for the Region. I do not find it necessary to repeat this review because I propose, for the purposes of this appeal, to accept the following conclusions that counsel for the appellant and for the intervenant seek to draw, in part, from that history: (i) that the making of zoning regulations and the imposition of controls of the use of land situate in any province of the sort provided, for example, in the Planning Act (Ontario) are matters which, generally speaking, come within the classes of subjects assigned to the Legislatures by s. 92 of the British North America Act; (ii) that the legislative history of the predecessors of the National Capital Act indicates that Parliament, up to the time of the passing of that Act, contemplated that the \"zoning\" of the lands comprised in the National Capital Region should be effected by co-operation between the Commission established by Parliament and the municipalities which derive their powers from the Provincial Legislatures; and (iii) that it was only after prolonged and unsuccessful efforts to achieve the desired result by such co-operation that Parliament decided to confer upon the National Capital Commission the powers necessary to enable it to carry out the zoning contemplated in the Master Plan. It is first necessary to consider what is the matter in relation to which the National Capital Act was passed and this requires an examination of its terms.\nIts full title is \"an Act respecting the Development and Improvement of the National Capital Region\".\nIt establishes a \"National Capital Region\", described in the Schedule to the Act, comprising approximately 1,800 square miles, including and surrounding the City of Ottawa, situate partly in the Province of Ontario and partly in the Province of Quebec. This region is defined as \"the seat of the Government of Canada and its surrounding area\". It includes the lands of the appellant in the Township of Gloucester.\nBy s. 3 of the Act, the respondent is created as a corporation to be called the \"National Capital Commission\" and by s. 27 it and the Federal District Commission are declared for all purposes to be one and the same corporation. By s. 4(1) it is declared that the Commission is for all purposes of the Act an agent of Her Majesty and that its powers under the Act may be exercised only as an agent of Her Majesty.\nSection 10 defines the objects and purposes of the Commission and confers the powers to be used for the purposes of the Act. It reads as follows:\n10.(1) The objects and purposes of the Commission are to prepare plans for and assist in the development, conservation and improvement of the National Capital Region in order that the nature and character of the seat of the Government of Canada may be in accordance with its national significance.\n(2) The Commission may for the purposes of this Act,\n(a) acquire, hold, administer or develop property;\n(b) sell, grant, convey, lease or otherwise dispose of or make available to any person any property, subject to such conditions and limitations as it considers necessary or desirable;\n(c) construct, maintain and operate parks, squares, highways, park-ways, bridges, buildings and any other works;\n(d) maintain and improve any property of the Commission, or any other property under the control and management of a department, at the request of the authority or Minister in charge thereof;\n(e) co-operate or engage in joint projects with, or make grants to, local municipalities or other authorities for the improvement, development or maintenance of property; (f) construct, maintain and operate, or grant concessions for the operation of, places of entertainment, amusement, recreation, refreshment, or other places of public interest or accommodation upon any property of the Commission;\n(g) administer, preserve and maintain any historic place or historic museum;\n(h) conduct investigations and researches in connection with the planning of the National Capital Region; and\n(i) generally, do and authorize such things as are incidental or conducive to the attainment of the objects and purposes of the Commission and the exercise of its powers.\nSection 13(1) reads as follows:\n13.(1) The Commission may, with the approval of the Governor in Council, take or acquire lands for the purpose of this Act without the consent of the owner, and, except as otherwise provided in this section, all the provisions of the Expropriation Act, with such modifications as circumstances require, are applicable to and in respect of the exercise of the powers conferred by this section and the lands so taken or acquired.\nSubsection (3) of this section provides that all claims for compensation for lands taken under the section may be heard and determined in the Exchequer Court of Canada.\nBy section 18, it is provided that the Commission may make by-laws for the conduct and management of its activities and for carrying out the purposes and provisions of the Act.\nIn my view, it is clear, from a reading of the Act as a whole, that the matter in relation to which it is enacted is the establishment of a region consisting of the seat of the Government of Canada and the defined surrounding area which are formed into a unit to be known as the National Capital Region which is to be developed, conserved and improved \"in order that the nature and character of the seat of the Government of Canada may be in accordance with its national significance\".\nThe next question is whether this subject matter comes within any of the classes of subjects which, by s. 92 of the British North America Act, are assigned exclusively to the Legislatures of the Provinces.\nThe only reference to the National Capital of Canada contained in the British North America Act is in s. 16, which reads as follows:\n16. Until the Queen otherwise directs, the Seat of Government of Canada shall be Ottawa. The authority reserved by this section to the Queen to change the location of the Seat of Government of Canada would now be exercisable by Her Majesty in the right of Canada and, while the section contemplates executive action, the change could, doubtless, be made by Act of Parliament in which Her Majesty acts with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada.\nThe subject matter of the National Capital Act, as I have sought to define it above, is not referred to in either s. 91 or s. 92 of the British North America Act. In Attorney-General for Alberta v. Attorney-General for Canada,[4] Viscount Maugham said at p. 371:\nIt must not be forgotten that where the subject matter of any legislation is not within any of the enumerated heads either of s. 91 or of s. 92, the sole power rests with the Dominion under the preliminary words of s. 91, relative to \"laws for the peace, order, and good government of Canada\".\nIn In re Regulation and Control of Radio Communication in Canada[5], Viscount Dunedin had made a similar observation at p. 312:\nBeing, therefore, not mentioned explicitly in either s. 91 or s. 92, such legislation falls within the general words at the opening of s. 91 which assign to the Government of the Dominion the power to make laws \"for the peace, order and good government of Canada in relation to all matters not coming within the classes of subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the Provinces\".\nIn Johannesson v. Rural Municipality of West St. Paul[6], in which it was held that the subject of aeronautics is within the exclusive jurisdiction of Parliament, this Court (at pages 308, 311, 318 and 328) adopted as the true test, to be applied in determining whether a subject matter falls within the legislative authority of Parliament under the general words at the opening of s. 91, that formulated by Viscount Simon in the Canada Temperance Federations[7] case, in the following words:\nIn their Lordships' opinion, the true test must be found in the real subject matter of the legislation: if it is such that it goes beyond local or provincial concern or interests and must from its inherent nature be the concern of the Dominion as a whole (as, for example, in the Aeronautics case and the Radio case), then it will fall within the competence of the Dominion Parliament as a matter affecting the peace, order and good government of Canada, though it may in another aspect touch on matters specially reserved to the provincial legislatures.\nI find it difficult to suggest a subject matter of legislation which more clearly goes beyond local or provincial interests and is the concern of Canada as a whole than the development, conservation and improvement of the National Capital Region in accordance with a coherent plan in order that the nature and character of the seat of the Government of Canada may be in accordance with its national significance. Adopting the words of the learned trial judge, it is my view that the Act \"deals with a single matter of national concern\".\nThere is no doubt that the exercise of the powers conferred upon the Commission by the National Capital Act will affect the civil rights of residents in those parts of the two provinces which make up the National Capital Region. In the case at bar the rights of the appellant are affected. But once it has been determined that the matter in relation to which the Act is passed is one which falls within the power of Parliament it is no objection to its validity that its operation will affect civil rights in the provinces. As Viscount Simon, adopting what had been pointed out by Rand J., said in Attorney-General for Saskatchewan v. Attorney-General for Canada[8]:\nConsequential effects are not the same thing as legislative subject matter. It is \"the true nature and character of the legislation\"\u2014not its ultimate economic results\u2014that matters.\nThe passage from the judgment of Duff J., as he then was, in Gold Seal Limited v. Dominion Express Company and Attorney-General for Alberta[9], quoted by the learned trial judge, correctly states the law. It is as follows:\nThe fallacy lies in failing to distinguish between legislation affecting civil rights and legislation \"in relation to\" civil rights. Most legislation of a repressive character does incidentally or consequentially affect civil rights. But if in its true character it is not legislation \"in relation to\" the subject matter of \"property and civil rights\" within the provinces, within the meaning of section 92 of the British North America Act, then that is no objection although it be passed in exercise of the residuary authority conferred by the introductory clause. I have already indicated my view that the matter in relation to which the National Capital Act was passed does not come within any of the classes of subjects enumerated in s. 92.\nIt has been said repeatedly that, in dealing with questions that arise under the British North America Act as to the allocation of law-making powers between Parliament and the Legislatures of the Provinces, the court will be well advised to confine itself to the precise question raised in the proceeding which is before it. It is sufficient in this case to say that in my opinion it is within the powers of Parliament to authorize the Commission, for the attainment of its objects and purposes as defined in the Act, to make the expropriation of the lands of the appellant referred to in the question submitted to the Exchequer Court. It follows from this that I agree with the conclusion of the learned trial judge that the question submitted to him should be answered in the negative.\nFor these reasons I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Hughes, Laishley, Mullen & Touhey, Ottawa.\nSolicitor for the respondent: E.

Cropper (Defendant) Respondent.\n1966: April 27, 28; 1966: June 20.\nPresent: Cartwright, Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Hall JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nCompanies\u2014Directors\u2014Fiduciary relationship\u2014Offer of mining claims considered and rejected by full board of directors\u2014Interest in claims subsequently acquired by director\u2014Whether director liable to account\u2014Counter-claim for wrongful dismissal.\nThe respondent was the managing director of the appellant company which held about 20 square miles of mineral claims in the Yukon Territory. An offer made to the appellant by a prospector, Dickson, of three groups of unproven claims, one of which was contiguous to the appellant's ground and the other two some miles to the northeast, was considered by the company's full board of directors and was rejected.\nAfter the appellant had rejected Dickson's offer and the matter had passed out of the respondent's mind, the possibility of a group being formed to acquire Dickson's claims was suggested to the respondent. It was agreed that the respondent and three others would take up these claims and they did so, each contributing an equal amount to finance the Purchase. A company, Cross Bow, was incorporated to make the purchase, and the four participants put up in equal shares the money necessary to have the intervening ground between the groups of claims \"staked blind\" by Dickson. Shortly afterwards a public company, Mayo, was incorporated to take over, finance and develop the properties.\nSome time later an offer by a company, Charter, to purchase a large interest in the appellant company was accepted. A term of the offer provided that the number of directors of the appellant should be increased to nine of whom five should be chosen by Charter. At a meeting of the new board, the respondent, acting in compliance with a notice from the chairman that it was imperative that all officers of the company make full disclosure of their connection with other mining companies, disclosed his interest in Cross Bow and Mayo. However, at a subsequent meeting of the board he refused to comply with the chairman's request that he turn over his interest in Cross Bow (and two other companies with which the present appeal was not concerned) at cost. Thereupon a motion was passed rescinding the appointment of the respondent as executive vice-president and as a member of the executive committee. The respondent was asked to vacate the offices of the company and the chairman asked him to resign as a director. The respondent refused to resign as a director but did so later and his resignation was accepted.\nIn an action commenced by the appellant a declaration was claimed that the shares in Cross Bow, Mayo and in two other companies acquired by the respondent were held by him in trust for the appellant and it was asked that he be required to deliver the shares to the appellant or to account for the proceeds thereof. The respondent counter-claimed for damages for wrongful dismissal. At trial the action was dismissed and the counter-claim was allowed in the amount of $10,000. On appeal by the appellant to the Court of Appeal, the appeal was dismissed in so far as the appellant's action was concerned. However, the Court of Appeal reduced the respondent's damages from $10,000 to $6,500. An appeal and a cross-appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal were then brought to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal and the cross-appeal should be dismissed.\nOn the facts of this case it was impossible to say that the respondent obtained the interests he held in Cross Bow and Mayo by reason of the fact that he was a director of the appellant and in the course of the execution of that office.\nWhen Dickson offered his claims to the appellant it was the duty of the respondent to take part in the decision of the board as to whether that offer should be accepted or rejected. At that point he stood in a fiduciary relationship to the appellant. There were affirmative findings of fact that he and his co-directors acted in good faith, solely in the interests of the appellant and with sound business reasons in rejecting the offer. There was no suggestion in the evidence that the offer to the appellant was accompanied by any confidential information unavailable to any prospective purchaser or that the respondent as director had access to any information by reason of his office. When the later proposal with respect to Dickson's claims was made to the respondent, it was not in his capacity as a director of the appellant but as an individual member of the public.\nRegal (Hastings), Ltd. v. Gulliver et al., [1942] 1 All E. R. 378, applied; Zwicker v. Stanbury, [1953] 2 S.C.R. 438; Midcon Oil & Gas Ltd. v. New British Dominion Oil Co. Ltd. et al., [1958] S.C.R. 314, referred to.\nAs to the counter-claim, the trial judge had indicated that he would have fixed the damages at $6,500 were it not for the circumstances of the respondent's dismissal. This Court agreed with Bull J.A. that the claim having been founded on breach of contract the damages could not be increased by reason of the circumstances of dismissal whether in respect of the respondent's wounded feelings or the prejudicial effect upon his reputation and chances of finding other employment. The Court was also in agreement with Bull J.A. that in view of the respondent's evidence that he remained unemployed for only five months the award should be reduced to $6,500.\nAPPEAL and CROSS-APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Gregory J. in so far as that judgment dismissed the appellant's action for a declaration of constructive trust and allowing in part the appeal as to the judgment on the counter-claim. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed.\n[Page675]\nJ.S. Maguire, Q.C., and K. S. Fawcus, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nD. T. Braidwood, Q.C., and F. A. Melvin, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[2] dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Gregory J. in so far as that judgment dismissed the action and allowing in part the appeal as to the judgment on the counter-claim. Norris J.A., dissenting, would have allowed in part the appeal as to the judgment in the action and allowed the appeal as to the counter-claim in toto.\nIn the action the appellant claimed a declaration that the shares in Cross Bow Mines Limited, hereinafter referred to as \"Cross Bow\", Mayo Silver Mines Limited, hereinafter referred to as \"Mayo\", and in two other companies acquired by the respondent were held by him in trust for the appellant and asked that he be required to deliver the shares to the appellant or to account for the proceeds thereof. The respondent counter-claimed for $10,000 damages for wrongful dismissal. In this Court the appellant limited its claim to the shares in Cross Bow and Mayo and consequently we are not concerned with the claims in regard to the shares in the two other companies which were asserted in the Courts below.\nThe findings of fact made by the learned trial judge were concurred in by the Court of Appeal and were not challenged before us. In order to appreciate the questions to be decided it is necessary to set out the facts in some detail.\nThe respondent resides in Vancouver. At the date of the trial, in December 1964, he stated that he had had twenty years of successful business experience. He was then president of Traders Investment Limited in Vancouver and of several mining companies. He has a practical knowledge of mining and had done some prospecting for himself in 1958 and 1959.\nIn 1959, R. Verity, D. Ross and the respondent caused a company, Tanar Gold Mines Limited, hereinafter referred to as \"Tanar\" to be incorporated and became its first directors. At the invitation of the respondent C. S. Walker also became a shareholder and director of Tanar.\nOn March 17, 1961, Tanar caused the appellant to be incorporated as a private company. Walker, Verity and the respondent were its first directors and a month later three additional directors, Whittal, Lennox and Hodges were duly appointed. Tanar transferred to the appellant a number of claims in the Mayo district in the Yukon Territory which it had acquired from one C. D. Poli together with additional claims which had been staked on Tanar's instructions. In return for these, shares in the appellant were issued to Tanar.\nOn September 18, 1961, the appellant was converted into a public company and from time to time a considerable number of its shares were sold to raise funds to explore, develop and add to its properties. Until the commencement of the action the appellant, Tanar and Cal-Mac Gold Mines Ltd., another company which Tanar had caused to be incorporated, had their offices in the same suite in Vancouver.\nBy the end of 1961 or early in 1962 the appellant had acquired, in addition to the claims which it had been formed to take over, a further 128 claims from the Barker Estate. In the result in the spring of 1962 it held about 20 square miles of mineral claims in the Yukon and was doing field work and exploration thereon. It had strained the financial resources of the appellant to take over the Barker claims. The appellant had been advised by its engineers that it should spend on the properties it then held from $40,000 to $50,000 per month during 1962. The acquisition of additional claims would have involved increased expenditures and the appellant neither needed nor wanted any more ground at this time.\nOn April 20, 1961, the respondent was appointed managing director of the appellant at a monthly salary of $750 which was increased to $11,000 per annum in June 1962.\nEarly in the spring of 1962 a prospector, Dickson, was endeavouring to sell three groups of claims in the Mayo district totalling 126 claims. One group was contiguous to the appellant's ground, a second was about five miles to the north-east and the third about eleven miles to the north-east. The claims were unproven and of speculative value. Dickson's asking price was some $31,000 in cash together with a block of shares in a public company to be formed to take over the property. Dickson approached Dr. Aho, a consulting geologist who was retained by the appellant and by many other mining companies. Dr. Aho suggested that Dickson should offer the claims to the appellant and he did so. Dickson's offer was considered by the full board of directors of the appellant in March 1962, and was rejected. On this point there are concurrent findings of fact which were expressed as follows in the reasons of Bull J.A.:\nIt was common ground, and so found by the learned trial Judge, that this decision rejecting the acquisition was an honest and considered decision of the appellant's board of directors as a whole and done in the best of faith and solely in the interest of the appellant, and not from any personal or ulterior motive on the part of any director, including the respondent.\nDuring the time that the respondent was an officer of the appellant there were between 200 and 300 mining properties offered to it; it was usual for it to receive two or three of such offers a week.\nAfter the appellant had rejected Dickson's offer and the matter had passed out of the respondent's mind, Dr. Aho came to the respondent and suggested the possibility of a group being formed to acquire Dickson's claims. After some discussion it was agreed that Dr. Aho, Walker, Verity and the respondent would take up these claims and they did so, each contributing an equal amount to finance the purchase. Dr. Aho who knew the property advised his associates that he was unaware of any specific mineralization thereon and it is common ground that the purchase was a highly speculative venture.\nIn May 1962, Cross Bow was incorporated to make the purchase, the four participants put up in equal shares the money necessary to have the intervening ground between the groups of claims \"staked blind\" by Dickson thus increasing the total holdings to approximately 326 claims. Shortly afterwards Mayo was incorporated as a public company to take over, finance and develop the properties and Cross Bow received 600,000 escrowed shares of Mayo for the properties out of which Dickson received his agreed proportion. Later the respondent and his associates bought for cash about 50,000 free treasury shares of Mayo at 10 cents to 12 cents per share. The respondent was at all relevant times a director of both Cross Bow and Mayo.\nIn November 1963, Charter Oil Company Limited, hereinafter referred to as \"Charter\", offered to purchase 1,000,000 shares of the capital stock of the appellant at the price of $1 per share, payable $200,000 on the date of closing and $200,000 on or before the tenth days of February, April, June and August, 1964. It was a term of the offer that Charter should have an option to purchase an additional 400,000 shares of the appellant at $1 per share at any time prior to October 11, 1964, and that at the annual meeting of the appellant to be held on December 16. 1963, the number of directors of the appellant should be increased to nine of whom five should be chosen by Charter. It was provided that these five should be P. O. Berliz, H. M. Beaumont, D. G. Buchanan, D. M. Clark and N. Johns and that P. O. Berliz should be appointed Chairman of the Board. This offer was accepted and the acceptance was approved at a meeting of the appellant's directors held on December 10, 1963. At the annual meeting of the appellant on December 16, 1963, the five persons named above were elected directors and the other four elected were C. S. Walker, P. L. Whittal, S. D. Anfield and the respondent.\nAt a meeting of the directors of the appellant held on December 16, 1963, following the annual meeting the following resolution was passed:\nAppointment of Officers\nUpon Motion it was resolved that the following persons be appointed officers of the Company for the ensuing year:\nP. O. Berliz\nChairman\nC.S. Walker\nPresident\nS. E. Cropper\nExecutive Vice-President\nD.M. Clark\nSecretary-Treasurer\nIt was also resolved that the respondent's salary be increased by $2,000 per annum, thus bringing his yearly salary up to $13,000.\nAccording, to the evidence of Mr. Walker, who was called by the plaintiff, there was a disagreement between Berliz and the respondent in regard to the making of the payment of $200,000 from Charter to the appellant which fell due in February 1964 and this resulted in \"a spirit of unfriendliness between the two of them\". On February 26, 1964, Berliz sent a memorandum to the respondent reading in part: \"It is imperative that all officers of Peso Silver Mines make full disclosure of their connection with other mining companies.\" At a meeting of the executive committee of the appellant on March 6, 1964, the respondent disclosed his interest in Cross Bow and Mayo and repeated this at a meeting of the directors of the appellant on March 16, 1964. At the last-mentioned meeting Berliz asked the respondent if he was prepared to turn over his interest in Cross Bow (and two other companies with which we are not now concerned) at cost. The respondent stated that he would give the matter further consideration. The meeting was later adjourned to the following day. When it reconvened Berliz repeated his request and the respondent refused. Thereupon a motion was passed rescinding the appointment of the respondent as Executive Vice-President and as a member of the Executive Committee. The respondent was asked \"to vacate the offices of the Company\" and Berliz asked him to resign as a director. The respondent refused to resign as a director but did so later and his resignation was accepted at a meeting of the directors on April 8, 1964.\nThe action was commenced on March 19, 1964.\nThe appellant submits that the shares in Cross Bow and Mayo held by the respondent are property obtained by him as a result of his position as a director of the appellant, without the approval of the latter's shareholders, and that equity imposes upon him an obligation to account to the appellant for that property which is unaffected by the circumstances that he acted throughout in good faith, that the appellant had decided for sound business reasons not to acquire the property and had suffered no loss by reason of the respondent's actions.\nCounsel for the appellant founded his argument on the decision of the House of Lords in Regal (Hastings), Ltd. v. Gulliver et al.[3], in which the principles of equity relating to the liability of a person who acquires property in regard to which a fiduciary relationship exists are considered and the leading cases are reviewed. The judgment in Regal has been followed by this Court in Zwicker v. Stanbury[4] and in Midcon Oil & Gas Ltd. v. New British Dominion Oil Co. Ltd. et al.[5] Counsel for the respondent accepts the statements of the law contained in Regal and submits that their application to the facts of the case at bar does not result in imposing liability on the respondent.\nIt is not necessary to review the somewhat complicated facts of the Regal case. While each of the Law Lords stated his reasons in his own words, there was no difference in substance between their statements of the test to be applied in determining whether or not the directors were liable to account for the profit which they personally had made on the purchase and resale of shares in a subsidiary of Regal. It will be of assistance to consider the actual words which were used.\nViscount Sankey said, at p. 381:\nIn my view, the respondents were in a fiduciary position and their liability to account does not depend upon proof of mala fides. The general rule of equity is that no one who has duties of a fiduciary nature to perform is allowed to enter into engagements in which he has or can have a personal interest conflicting with the interests of those whom he is bound to protect. If he holds any property so acquired as trustee, he is bound to account for it to his cestui que trust.\nLord Russell of Killowen, with whose reasons Lord Macmillan, Lord Wright and Lord Porter agreed, said at p. 385:\nWe have to consider the question of the respondents' liability on the footing that, in taking up these shares in Amalgamated, they acted with bona fides, intending to act in the interest of Regal.\nNevertheless they may be liable to account for the profits which they have made, if, while standing in a fiduciary relationship to Regal, they have by reason and in course of that fiduciary relationship made a profit.\nand at p. 386:\nThe rule of equity which insists on those, who by use of a fiduciary position make a profit, being liable to account for that profit, in no way depends on fraud, or absence of bona fides; or upon such questions or considerations as whether the profit would or should otherwise have gone to the plaintiff, or whether the profiteer was under a duty to obtain the source of the profit for the plaintiff, or whether he took a risk or acted as he did for the benefit of the plaintiff, or whether the plaintiff has in fact been damaged or benefited by his action. The liability arises from the mere fact of a profit having, in the stated circumstances, been made. The profiteer, however honest and well-intentioned, cannot escape the risk of being called upon to account.\nLater on the same page he posed and answered the question which he regarded as the crux of the case:\nDid such of the first five respondents as acquired these very profitable shares acquire them by reason and in course of their office of directors of Regal? In my opinion, when the facts are examined and appreciated, the answer can only be that they did.\nand at p. 389:\nIn the result, I am of opinion that the directors standing in a fiduciary relationship to Regal in regard to the exercise of their powers as directors, and having obtained these shares by reason and only by reason of the fact that they were directors of Regal and in the course of the execution of that office, are accountable for the profits which they have made out of them.\nIn Midcon Oil & Gas Ltd. v. New British Dominion Oil Co. Ltd. et al., supra, at p. 327, Locke J., giving the judgment of the majority of this Court quoted this passage and said that it summarized the ground on which the judgment of the House of Lords proceeded. The difference of opinion in this Court was not as to the principles of law stated in Regal but as to whether the facts of the case fell within those principles.\nIn the course of his short concurring speech Lord Macmillan said at p. 391:\nThe sole ground on which it was sought to render them accountable was that, being directors of the plaintiff company and therefore in a fiduciary relationship to it, they entered in the course of their management into a transaction in which they utilised the position and knowledge possessed by them in virtue of their office as directors, and that the transaction resulted in a profit to themselves.\nand at pp. 391 and 392:\nThe issue thus becomes one of fact. The plaintiff company has to establish two things, (i) that what the directors did was so related to the affairs of the company that it can properly be said to have been done in the course of their management and in utilisation of their opportunities and special knowledge as directors; and (ii) that what they did resulted in a profit to themselves.\nLord Wright said at p. 393:\nMany instances can be quoted from the books of the stringency with which the courts have enforced the rule that a director must account to his company for any benefit which he obtains in the course of and owing to his directorship, even though the benefit comes from a third person and involves no loss to the company.\nLord Porter said at p. 395:\nThe legal proposition may, I think, be broadly stated by saying that one occupying a position of trust must not make a profit which he can acquire only by use of his fiduciary position, or, if he does, he must account for the profit so made. and on the same page:\nDirectors, no doubt, are not trustees, but they occupy a fiduciary position towards the company whose board they form. Their liability in this respect does not depend upon breach of duty but upon the proposition that a director must not make a profit out of property acquired by reason of his relationship to the company of which he is a director.\nThe phrases which I have italicized in some of the passages quoted above appear to me to state in varying words the principle which Lord Russell of Killowen laid down, at p. 389 of the Regal judgment, in the passage quoted above which was adopted by Locke J. in the Midcon case.\nOn the facts of the case at bar I find it impossible to say that the respondent obtained the interests he holds in Cross Bow and Mayo by reason of the fact that he was a director of the appellant and in the course of the execution of that office.\nWhen Dickson, at Dr. Aho's suggestion, offered his claims to the appellant it was the duty of the respondent as director to take part in the decision of the board as to whether that offer should be accepted or rejected. At that point he stood in a fiduciary relationship to the appellant. There are affirmative findings of fact that he and his co-directors acted in good faith, solely in the interests of the appellant and with sound business reasons in rejecting the offer. There is no suggestion in the evidence that the offer to the appellant was accompanied by any confidential information unavailable to any prospective purchaser or that the respondent as director had access to any such information by reason of his office. When, later, Dr. Aho approached the appellant it was not in his capacity as a director of the appellant, but as an individual member of the public whom Dr. Aho was seeking to interest as a co-adventurer.\nThe judgments in the Regal case in the Court of Appeal are not reported but counsel were good enough to furnish us with copies. In the course of his reasons Lord Greene M.R. said:\nTo say that the Company was entitled to claim the benefit of those shares would involve this proposition: Where a Board of Directors considers an investment which is offered to their company and bona fide comes to the conclusion that it is not an investment which their Company ought to make, any Director, after that Resolution is come to and bona fide come to, who chooses to put up the money for that investment himself must be treated as having done it on behalf of the Company, so that the Company can claim any profit that results to him from it. That is a proposition for which no particle of authority was cited; and goes, as it seems to me, far beyond anything that has ever been suggested as to the duty of directors, agents, or persons in a position of that kind.\nIn the House of Lords, Lord Russell of Killowen concluded his reasons, at p. 391, with the following paragraph:\nOne final observation I desire to make. In his judgment Lord Greene, M.R., stated that a decision adverse to the directors in the present case involved the proposition that, if directors bona fide decide not to invest their company's funds in some proposed investment, a director who thereafter embarks his own money therein is accountable for any profits which he may derive therefrom. As to this, I can only say that to my mind the facts of this hypothetical case bear but little resemblance to the story with which we have had to deal.\nI agree with Bull J.A. when after quoting the two above passages he says:\nAs Greene, M.R. was found to be in error in his decision, I would think that the above comment by Lord Russell on the hypothetical case would be superfluous unless it was intended to be a reservation that he had no quarrel with the proposition enunciated by the Master of the Rolls, but only that the facts of the case before him did not fall within it.\nAs Bull J.A. goes on to point out, the same view appears to have been entertained by Lord Denning M.R. in Phipps v. Boardman[6].\nIf the members of the House of Lords in Regal had been of the view that in the hypothetical case stated by Lord Greene the director would have been liable to account to the company, the elaborate examination of the facts contained in the speech of Lord Russell of Killowen would have been unnecessary.\nThe facts of the case at bar appear to me in all material respects identical with those in the hypothetical case stated by Lord Greene and I share the view which he expressed that in such circumstances the director is under no liability. I agree with the conclusion of the learned trial judge and of the majority in the Court of Appeal that the action fails.\nIt remains to consider the counter-claim. In this Court the appellant did not argue that the dismissal without notice was justified unless it should be held that the respondent was under a duty to account to the appellant for his interests in Cross Bow and Mayo; consequently the only remaining question is as to the quantum of damages. The learned trial judge awarded the respondent $10,000 which represented the balance of his salary for the year ending December 16, 1964. He indicated, however, that he would have fixed the damages at $6,500 were it not for the circumstances of the respondent's dismissal, namely that the unsubstantiated allegations of impropriety made against him and the fact of his dismissal so shortly after Charter had taken control of the appellant could not fail to damage his reputation among mining men. I agree with Bull J.A. that the claim being founded on breach of contract the damages cannot be increased by reason of the circumstances of dismissal whether in respect of the respondent's wounded feelings or the prejudicial effect upon his reputation and chances of finding other employment. I am also in agreement with Bull J.A. that in view of the respondent's evidence that he remained unemployed for only five months the award should be reduced to $6,500.\nFor the above reasons I would dismiss both the appeal and the cross-appeal with costs.\nAppeal and cross-appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Clark, Wilson, White, Clark & Maguire, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Sutton, Braidwood, Morris, Hall & Sutton, Vancouver.\n[1] (1965), 54 W.W.R. 329, 56 D.L.R.

Initially the financing had been undertaken by Transcontinental Resources Ltd. When it became necessary to obtain substantial additional capital, the appellant company was incorporated so as to have all the financing and marketing operations done through one agency. Thereupon, by contract dated January 15, 1943, the appellant became the exclusive sales agent for Steep Rock and became entitled to a commission of 2 per cent of the value of all ores sold. The agreement also provided for the appellant to purchase shares of Steep Rock and to lend it money. Eighteen days later, the appellant entered into an agreement with a Mr. Carr, president of Transcontinental Resources Ltd., whereby the appellant agreed to pay over to him 20 per cent of the moneys received from Steep Rock. In that agreement, Mr. Carr had waived his right to be appointed sales agent for Steep Rock. Additional funds were soon needed, and another agreement, dated December 29, 1944, was entered into whereby the appellant agreed to take 267,000 shares of Steep Rock for $600,000, of which 100,000 shares were to be taken by Transcontinental Resources Ltd. in its role as a continuing participant in the financing. The appellant covenanted at that time to pay to Transcontinental Resources Ltd., from the 2 per cent commission on Steep Rock Iron Ore sales, the 20 per cent which it had previously undertaken to pay to Carr.\nThe first issue under appeal was the question as to whether the appellant could deduct from its taxable income the 20 per cent paid in the years 1951 and 1952 to Transcontinental Resources Ltd. The Minister refused to allow the deduction. The Tax Appeal Board allowed the deduction but its decision was reversed by the Exchequer Court.\nThe second issue under appeal involved the question as to whether legal expenses incurred by the appellant in 1951 and 1952, in successfully contesting a claim asserted by the United States tax authorities, were deductible as business expenses. The Minister disallowed these expenses and his decision was supported by the Tax Appeal Board and by the Exchequer Court. The taxpayer appealed to this Court on both issues.\nHeld (on the first issue): The appeal should be allowed.\nHeld (on the second issue) (Ritchie and Abbott JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed. [AS TO THE FIRST ISSUE]\nPer Curiam: There is no doubt that agreements are to be construed in accordance with the plain and ordinary meaning of the words which they contain, and that the words used in a written agreement are to be construed in the light of the circumstances under which it was concluded. In the present case, it was apparent that from the time of its incorporation the appellant company was engaged with Transcontinental Resources Ltd. in the joint venture of financing Steep Rock and that the 20 per cent represented Transcontinental's share in the venture. Therefore, the appellant was never beneficially entitled to retain more than 80 per cent of the commissions which it received from Steep Rock, and the remaining 20 per cent could not be said to form a portion of its taxable income.\n[AS TO THE SECOND ISSUE]\nPer Martland and Spence JJ.: While the legal expenses were not made solely for the purpose of earning income, they were made with a view to protecting the income earning capacity of the appellant. Had the claim of the U.S. government been established, it would have created a liability in relation to the appellant's income. The expense incurred here was for the purpose of resisting the demands of a foreign taxing authority which, had it succeeded, would have substantially depleted the income of a Canadian company. A claim of that kind is a claim by a third party. It mattered not, so far as the Canadian authority was concerned, that the nature of the claim was one for income tax. In so far as the Canadian taxing authority was concerned, there was no difference in principle between an expenditure in the form of legal fees paid by a railway company to defend a damage claim by a passenger, and thus protect the company's income, and the expenditure for legal fees paid by the appellant to resist a foreign tax claim and thus to protect its income. A payment made for legal services in an attempt to protect income against encroachment by a third party is in principle properly deductible on the authority of The Minister of National Revenue v. The Kellogg Co. of Canada, [1943] S.C.R. 58 and Evans v. The Minister of National Revenue, [1960] S.C.R. 391.\nPe Hall J.: The working capital of the appellant and its profit earning potential were preserved by the successful resistance of the unjustified U.S. claim for income tax. The majority judgment in Smith's Potato Estates Ltd. v. Bolland, [1948] 2. All E.R. 367, is not the correct statement of the law as applied to the provisions of the Canadian Income Tax Act. The \"income\" means the net receipts over disbursements in the taxation year in the totality of the taxpayer's business as an on-going concern, other than capital expenditures, gifts and the like. There is no reason to regard legal expenses as differing from other expenses. No distinction is to be drawn between proper legal expenses and other business expenses. The expenditures in this case were ones which under sound accounting and commercial practices would be deducted as expenditures for the year in determining the profit, if any, of the company for that year.\nPer Abbott and Ritchie JJ., dissenting in part: The reasoning in the majority judgment in Smith's Potato Estates case, supra, applies to the present case. The cost of ascertaining the true amount of tax to be paid is not an expense made in order to earn profits but rather for the purpose of preserving profits already earned. There is no material distinction between a payment made to resist income tax demand abroad and one to resist a similar demand at home.\nRevenu\u2014Imp\u00f4t sur le revenu\u2014Repr\u00e9sentant d'une compagnie mini\u00e8re\u2014Paiement de 20 pour-cent des sommes re\u00e7ues \u00e0 une tierce personne en vertu d'un contrat pour partager une obligation de financement\u2014Ce paiement est-il une d\u00e9pense d\u00e9ductible ou un d\u00e9bours\u00e9 en capital\u2014D\u00e9penses l\u00e9gales encourues lors de la contestation d'une r\u00e9clamation pour imp\u00f4t provenant des \u00c9tats-Unis\u2014Ces d\u00e9penses sont-elles d\u00e9ductibles\u2014Loi de l'Imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, S.R.C. 1952, c. 148, art. 12(1)(a), (b).\nLa compagnie appelante a \u00e9t\u00e9 incorpor\u00e9e dans l'Ontario dans le but de participer au financement de la compagnie Steep Rock Iron Ore Mines Ltd. et de mettre sur le march\u00e9 le minerai produit par cette derni\u00e8re. Au d\u00e9but, la compagnie Transcontinental Resources Ltd. avait entrepris ce financement. Lorsqu'il devint n\u00e9cessaire d'obtenir un capital substantiel additionnel, la compagnie appelante fut incorpor\u00e9e pour que le financement et les op\u00e9rations de march\u00e9 puissent passer par les mains d'une seule agence. Cons\u00e9quemment, en vertu d'un contrat en date du 15 janvier 1943, l'appelante est devenue le repr\u00e9sentant exclusif de Steep Rock avec droit \u00e0 une commission de 2 pour-cent de la valeur du minerai vendu. En vertu du contrat, l'appelante devait se porter acqu\u00e9reur d'actions de Steep Rock et devait lui avancer des fonds. Quelque dix-huit jours plus tard, l'appelante et un monsieur Carr, pr\u00e9sident de Transcontinental Resources Ltd., sign\u00e8rent un contrat en vertu duquel l'appelante s'engagea \u00e0 payer \u00e0 monsieur Carr 20 pour-cent des argents re\u00e7us de la Steep Rock. Dans ce contrat, monsieur Carr a renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 son droit d'\u00eatre nomm\u00e9 repr\u00e9sentant de Steep Rock. Des fonds additionnels ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 requis, un autre contrat, en date du 29 d\u00e9cembre 1944, fut sign\u00e9 par les parties. Par ce contrat, l'appelante devait se porter acqu\u00e9reur de 267,000 actions de Steep Rock pour une somme de $600,000. De ces actions, 100,000 devaient \u00eatre acquises par Transcontinental Resources Ltd. en vertu de son r\u00f4le de participant continuel au financement. L'appelante s'engagea alors \u00e0 payer \u00e0 Transcontinental Resources Ltd. \u00e0 m\u00eame le 2 pour-cent de commission sur les ventes de Steep Rock, le 20 pour-cent qu'elle s'\u00e9tait engag\u00e9e pr\u00e9alablement \u00e0 payer \u00e0 monsieur Carr.\nLe premier point sous appel \u00e9tait celui de savoir si l'appelante pouvait d\u00e9duire de son imp\u00f4t taxable le 20 pour-cent qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 durant les ann\u00e9es 1951 et 1952 \u00e0 Transcontinental Resources Ltd. Le Ministre a refus\u00e9 de permettre la d\u00e9duction. La Commission d'Appel de l'Imp\u00f4t a permis la d\u00e9duction mais sa d\u00e9cision fut renvers\u00e9e par la Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier.\nLe second point sous appel \u00e9tait celui de savoir si les d\u00e9penses l\u00e9gales encourues par l'appelante en 1951 et 1952, lorsqu'elle contesta avec succ\u00e8s une r\u00e9clamation d'imp\u00f4t pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le gouvernement des \u00c9tats-Unis, \u00e9taient d\u00e9ductibles comme d\u00e9penses d'affaires.

[SUR LE PREMIER POINT]\nLa Cour: Il n'y a aucun doute que les contrats doivent \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s conform\u00e9ment au sens clair et ordinaire des mots qu'ils contiennent, et que les mots dont on se sert dans un \u00e9crit doivent \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des circonstances en vertu desquelles l'accord a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu. Dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, il \u00e9tait \u00e9vident qu'\u00e0 partir du moment de son incorporation la compagnie appelante \u00e9tait engag\u00e9e avec Transcontinental Resources Ltd. dans une op\u00e9ration en commun pour le financement de Steep Rock et que le 20 pour-cent repr\u00e9sentait la part de Transcontinental Resources Ltd. dans l'op\u00e9ration. En cons\u00e9quence, l'appelante n'avait jamais eu droit de garder plus que 80 pour-cent de la commission qu'elle recevait de Steep Rock, et on ne peut pas dire que le 20 pour-cent qui restait formait une partie de son imp\u00f4t taxable.\n[SUR LE SECOND POINT]\nLes Juges Martland et Spence: Quoique les d\u00e9penses l\u00e9gales n'avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 faites seulement en vue de produire un revenu, cependant elles avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 faites en vue de prot\u00e9ger la capacit\u00e9 de l'appelante de gagner un revenu. Si la r\u00e9clamation du gouvernement des \u00c9tats-Unis avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie, ceci aurait cr\u00e9\u00e9 une charge sur les revenus de l'appelante.

Une telle r\u00e9clamation est une r\u00e9clamation par une tierce partie. En autant que l'autorit\u00e9 canadienne \u00e9tait concern\u00e9e, cela n'avait pas d'importance que la r\u00e9clamation en soit une pour imp\u00f4t sur le revenu. En autant que l'autorit\u00e9 canadienne \u00e9tait concern\u00e9e, il n'y avait aucune diff\u00e9rence en principe entre une d\u00e9pense pour frais l\u00e9gaux pay\u00e9s par une compagnie de chemin de fer pour se d\u00e9fendre contre une r\u00e9clamation d'un passager, et ainsi prot\u00e9ger le revenu de la compagnie, et la d\u00e9pense pour frais l\u00e9gaux pay\u00e9s par l'appelante pour r\u00e9sister \u00e0 une r\u00e9clamation pour taxe \u00e9trang\u00e8re, et ainsi prot\u00e9ger son revenu.

Appel maintenu, les Juges Abbott et Ritchie \u00e9tant dissidents en partie.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Cattanach J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada[2], in a matter of income tax. Appeal allowed, Abbott and Ritchie JJ. dissenting in part.\nHazen Hansard, Q.C., and D. O. Mungovan, Q.C., for the appellant.\nD. S. Maxwell, Q.C., and B. Verch\u00e8re, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Abbott and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nRITCHIE J. (dissenting in part):\u2014This is an appeal from two judgments of the Exchequer Court of Canada1 based on a single decision rendered by Cattanach J. whereby he allowed the appeal of the Minister of National Revenue from a decision of the Tax Appeal Board and thereby approved a reassessment of the present appellant's taxable income for the years 1951 and 1952 adding thereto amounts of $46,532.56 and $45,192.03 which were described by the Minister of National Revenue as \"Commissions paid pursuant to agreement of December 29, 1944 with Transcontinental Resources Limited\" and whereby he also dismissed the present appellant's cross appeal from a decision of the Tax Appeal Board disallowing a deduction from its taxable income for the years 1951 and 1952 of $20,832.51 being the total amount paid in those two years as legal expenses incurred in respect of a disputed claim for income tax by the United States Internal Revenue Service.\nThe appellant company was incorporated in Ontario in November 1942 for the purpose of undertaking, in co-operation with other Canadian and United States interests, the financing of the development of an iron ore deposit at Steep Rock Lake in northwestern Ontario and for the further purpose of marketing the ore produced from that deposit and the question raised by this appeal with respect to the payment of commissions must, in my view, be considered in light of the circumstances surrounding the early stages of this important mining development.\nThe ore deposit in question was discovered in 1938 on property owned by Steep Rock Iron Ore Mines Limited (hereinafter called \"Steep Rock\") and the financing of the very considerable operation necessary to extract the ore from under the Lake was initially undertaken by a Canadian group consisting of Mr. Arthur Carr, the President of Transcontinental Resources Limited and his associates in that Company. Large sums of money were expended in sinking a shaft and running drifts under the Lake in an effort to mine the ore but this proved unsuccessful and it was decided that the only alternative was to embark on the extensive and very costly task of pumping over 100 billion gallons of water out of Steep Rock Lake.\nIn order to obtain the substantial additional capital necessary to finance this difficult operation, contact was made with Mr. Cyrus Eaton and the Otis Company of Cleveland, Ohio, of which he was the President. It was originally contemplated that the financing would be arranged by Steep Rock issuing $7,500,000 worth of first mortgage bonds of which $1,500,000 were to be marketed in Canada through Mr. Carr and Transcontinental Resources Limited (hereinafter referred to as \"Transcontinental\") and the balance in the United States through Otis and Company; Steep Rock, however, found it more convenient to deal through one agency and it was for this reason that after discussing the matter with Otis and Company and Transcontinental it was decided that the appellant company should be incorporated. The way in which this decision was made is perhaps best described in the evidence of Mr. William R. Daley, who is now President of Otis and Company and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the appellant company and who was the only witness called in these proceedings. In this regard he said:\nQ. In your previous testimony when you have referred to Mr. Carr and his associates, we must imply that you referred to Transcontinental as being the principal associate? A. Yes, I am. We ran into some complications in that Steep Rock wanted to deal with one agency. So in the ultimate\u2014I guess it is a long time before we got to the ultimate setup, but we then agreed we would form one agency, which would be a Canadian company\u2014Premium Iron Ores Limited, which would have a branch company in the United States. Arthur Carr and his associates would have a contract to distribute the iron ore that was being sold in Canada. Steep Rock wanted to deal with one agency, so it was finally agreed that Premium Iron Ores Limited itself would have exclusive agency and that it would have the co-operation of Arthur Carr and his associates both in the financing and in the sale of the iron ore.\nThe italics are my own.\nIn the result, by reason of wartime conditions the Canadian Minister of Finance refused to permit the marketing of these bonds in Canada and therefore the major portion of the financing had to be arranged by way of a loan from the United States Reconstruction Corporation. This loan was granted on the understanding that the appellant would undertake to procure firm purchasing contracts for the delivery of 10,000,000 tons of ore during a period of the next ten years, not less than 500,000 tons of which was to be delivered in each year, and upon a further undertaking by the appellant to furnish additional funds up to $1,000,000 if the actual cost of bringing the mine into production proved greater than the then estimate of $7,500,000.\nIn furtherance of these arrangements an agreement was entered into between Steep Rock and the appellant on January 15, 1943, wherein it was recited that Steep Rock had appointed the appellant the exclusive selling agent in respect of the iron ore to be mined and produced and the appellant agreed to procure firm purchasing orders for 10,000,000 tons of ore in the manner aforesaid and to render financial assistance up to $1,000,000 if the same were required. The terms of this agreement which most directly concern the issues in this appeal are contained in paragraphs 5, 9, 10 and 11.\nParagraph 5 contains an express covenant by Steep Rock\n\u2026subject as herein provided, to pay Premium for services referred to herein an amount equal to two percentum (2%) of the value of all Steep Rock ores sold by Premium and Steep Rock during the life of this agreement, whether such ores are delivered within the life of this agreement or not. and by paragraphs 9, 10 and 11 the appellant undertook to provide on demand additional financing for Steep Rock of $1,000,000 by way of a loan against promissory notes to be issued and further undertook to deposit voting trust certificates representing 800,000 shares of Steep Rock in trust with an approved trust company by way of assurance to Steep Rock of its ability to make such a loan. It was also agreed by paragraph 18 that 1,437,500 shares of Steep Rock would be allotted to Premium forthwith at a price of 1 cent per share.\nEighteen days after the execution of the last-mentioned agreement, i.e., on February 2, 1943, an agreement was entered into between the appellant and Arthur W. Carr wherein it was recited that Carr had agreed to waive his right to be appointed sales agent by Steep Rock and whereby the appellant covenanted and agreed\n\u2026that in each year hereafter during the lifetime of the Agency Contract it will pay to Carr a sum equal to Twenty Per Centum (20%) of all monies paid to it by Steep Rock or its successor during such year by way of commission or other compensation under the terms of the said Agency Contract.\nAs an indication of the continuing participation of Transcontinental in the financing of the Steep Rock Project, it is to be noted that on May 29, 1943, it entered into an agreement with the appellant whereby it agreed to contribute voting trust certificates representing 200,000 of the 800,000 shares of Steep Rock which the appellant had agreed to deposit under the terms of the agreement of January 15th.\nIn the latter part of 1944 it became apparent that the $7,500,000 which had been estimated as the cost of bringing the mine into production was not enough and Steep Rock accordingly called on Premium Iron Ores to put up part of the $1,000,000 which it had agreed to furnish but in accordance with the contracts existing between Steep Rock and the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, the form of the advance had to be approved by the latter body with the results which are described in the following evidence of Mr. Daley:\nWhen Steep Rock and Carr and myself reached Washington and took the matter up with Mr. McCartney, who represented the R.F.C. at that time, after a discussion with his associates he said the R.F.C. was not willing to let Steep Rock undertake any further obligations to pay out money. We pointed out, of course, to Mr. McCartney that R.F.C. had agreed to the provision in the Steep Rock\/Premium Contract whereby it was to be represented, the advances were to be represented by an obligation of Steep Rock up to a maximum of six percent, as I recall it, for up to a five-year period.\nMr. McCartney said in spite of that they were not willing to let Steep Rock assume any more debt but that they would agree if Steep Rock desired to do it, to let them issue stock at the market price for the amount that was needed.\nThe Steep Rock officials and Mr. Carr and I then conferred on that proposal, which resulted in an agreement whereby Premium agreed to take 267,000 shares of Steep Rock stock for approximately $600,000.00, of which Transcontinental Resources was to take 100,000 shares with the balance to be taken by Premium Iron Ores.\nA formal agreement was accordingly entered into on December 29, 1944, whereby Transcontinental in its role as a continuing participant in the financing, agreed to purchase 100,000 of the Steep Rock shares which the appellant had agreed to take up and the appellant covenanted to pay to Transcontinental from the 2 per cent commission on Steep Rock Iron Ore sales for which provision was made under the agreement of January 15, 1943, the 20 per cent which it had previously undertaken to pay to Carr under the agreement of February 2, 1943.\nThe sums of $46,532.56 and $45,192.03 which are now sought to be deducted from the appellant's taxable income represent the 20 per cent payable in accordance with the December 1944 agreement which were paid by the appellant in the years 1951 and 1952 respectively to one A. C. McFadyen who was the ultimate assignee of the rights of Transcontinental thereunder.\nIn disallowing the deduction of these amounts from the appellant's taxable income for the years in question, Cattanach J. basing his judgment upon his construction of the \"plain ordinary meaning\" of the words used in the agreements of January 15, 1943, and December 29, 1944, concluded that the payments were made in consideration of Transcontinental purchasing the 100,000 shares of Steep Rock and his analysis of the effect of the 1944 agreement is summarized in the following excerpt from his judgment:\nOn the one hand, as I view it, the respondent provides services as a sales agent to Steep Rock. On the other hand, the respondent has made an investment in Steep Rock shares. The purchase of such shares is an investment of capital and monies paid to a third party for purchasing some of those shares is equally a capital outlay and cannot be regarded as a current expense of the respondent's business. In my opinion the Minister was, therefore, right in assessing the respondent as he did and accordingly the appeal herein must be allowed with costs.\nWith the greatest respect it appears to me that in confining himself to the two agreements to which he refers, Mr. Justice Cattanach has failed to take into account the gradually developing chain of circumstances which led up to the mine being finally brought into production and in which Carr and his associates in Transcontinental had played a dominant role from the outset.\nThere is, of course, no doubt that the agreements are to be construed in accordance with the plain and ordinary meaning of the words which they contain. It is equally clear, however, that the words used in a written agreement are to be construed in light of the circumstances under which it was concluded. In this regard I accept the opinion expressed by Lord Blackburn in River Wear Commissioners v. Adamson[3], where he said:\n\u2026I shall therefore state, as precisely as I can, what I understand from the decided cases to be the principles on which the Courts of Law act in construing instruments in writing; \u2026In all cases the object is to see what is the intention expressed by the words used. But, from the imperfection of language, it is impossible to know what that intention is without inquiring farther, and seeing what the circumstances were with reference to which the words were used, and what was the object, appearing from those circumstances, which the person using them had in view; for the meaning of words varies according to the circumstances with respect to which they were used.\nThe same proposition was more succinctly stated by Jessel M.R. in Cannon v. Villers[4]:\nWhen construing all instruments you must know what the facts were when the agreements were entered into.\nWhen the series of agreements which are exhibits in the present case are considered against the background of Mr. Daley's evidence it is, as I have indicated, apparent that the appellant was incorporated at the instance of Otis and Company and Transcontinental for the purpose of participating in the financing of Steep Rock in co-operation with the two financial groups represented by these companies and that the agreement of January 1943 was entered into as the first step in fulfilment of this purpose, while the agreements of February and May 1943 and December 1944 were entered into in recognition of the continuing participation of the Transcontinental interests in the development of a final plan for the successful outcome of a venture with which they had been closely associated from the beginning.\nIt is to be remembered that the 2 per cent commission payable to the appellant under the January 1943 agreement was\n\u2026two percentum (2%) of the value of all Steep Rock ores sold by Premium and Steep Rock\u2026\nand that within eighteen days of entering into that agreement, i.e., on February 2, 1943, 20 per cent of this 2 per cent commission was assigned to Carr and later made payable to Transcontinental under the agreement of December 1944 by which, to use the language of Mr. Daley, \"the Carr agreement was absorbed\".\nIt is thus apparent that from the time of its incorporation the appellant was engaged with the Transcontinental group in the joint venture of financing Steep Rock, and that before the ore deposits had been brought into commercial production, it had agreed to forego 20 per cent of its commission on their sale which represented the share of its associates in this venture. By reason of the agreement which it entered into in recognition of the part played by its associates, the appellant was never beneficially entitled to retain more than 80 per cent of the commissions which it received from Steep Rock, and the remaining 20 per cent cannot in my opinion be said to form a portion of its taxable income. In this regard I agree with the following statement made by Mr. R. S. W. Fordham in the course of his reasons for judgment rendered by him on behalf of the Tax Appeal Board:\nI think too, it may be said that the appellant and Transcontinental were in a kind of joint adventure; each played an important part in making it possible for Steep Rock to acquire needed funds. The appellant\u2014and not Steep Rock\u2014became obligated to Transcontinental as a consequence. The monies paid to the latter were for a valued service rendered to the appellant in its fulfilment of an important part of the agency agreement with Steep Rock. Appellant was entitled to retain 80 per cent of the monies received from Steep Rock and no more. The remaining 20 per cent had become, by formal and enforceable agreement, the property of Transcontinental or its assignees. Hence, it was on the beneficial assignee that liability for tax on the 20 per cent fell and not on the appellant, which had no proprietary interest therein. I would accordingly allow the appeal with respect to the commissions paid by the appellant to Mr. McFadyen in the years 1951 and 1952 and direct that the reassessment by the Minister of National Revenue in this regard be set aside.\nThe legal expenses which the appellant seeks to deduct for the years 1951-52 were incurred in respect of a claim asserted by the United States tax authorities in the year 1950 relating to earnings of the appellant during the years 1943-1950 inclusive. The exact nature of the claim in respect of which the legal expenses were incurred can best be explained by somewhat lengthy reference to the evidence of Mr. Daley.\nAfter having been questioned as to the arrangement whereby Premium Iron Ores was permitted to purchase 1,437,500 shares of Steep Rock for $14,375, Mr. Daley's examination continued:\nQ. Turning to the question of the legal expenses involved in the United States and here, Mr. Daley, I did not quite understand when you said that the matter first came up in 1950 and you indicated, I think, some two or three million dollars in tax that they wanted. For what period was this two to three million dollars\u2014how long? Was it from the beginning of operations or for the year 1950 or what?\nA. I recall that Premium received this large block of shares of Steep Rock at one cent per share and while the Canadian Income Tax Department had said no tax will result from this transaction the United States government tried to assert a claim on profit for the difference between the market value on the Toronto Stock Market and the one cent.\nQ. That was with respect to your capital gain between the one cent and the 1.66?\nA. No, it was not. They said that was income for services.\n***\nQ. I am not getting into whether it is a capital gain or profit, but it represented what we might normally call the capital gain, whether it was considered profit or what it was considered. It represented the difference between the one cent and the 1.66?\nA. Yes, that is correct.\nQ. Was that the chief substance of what they were claiming against you?\nA. From 1945 on the claim also included all of the commissions that had been received from Steep Rock.\nQ. Generally it was with respect to the income from the beginning of Premium's existence; is that the idea?\nA. You say 'generally'. Of course that amount was not as large as the other amount, but they did assert a claim against all of those commissions claiming that was United States' income. Mr. Daley was later asked:\nQ. Can you tell me any better than you have, Mr. Daley, with respect to what precise years the United States government were claiming tax? I do not want to put words into your mouth. Was it 1943 and every year up to 1950?\nA. 1943 was the most important one and it was every year up through.\nQ. To the end?\nA. To, I think, 1950-the time they started their investigation.\nQ. Did you have accounts after the cases proceeded to court? Did you have accounts\u2014presumably you did\u2014from solicitors?\nA. Yes.\nThe appellant contends that these legal expenses in the years 1951-52 were deductible as having been incurred \"for the purpose of gaining or producing income\" under the provisions of s. 12(1) (a) of the Income Tax Act which reads as follows:\n12 (1) In computing income no deduction shall be made in respect of (a) an outlay or expense except to the extent that it was made or incurred by the taxpayer for the purpose of gaining or producing income from property or a business of the taxpayer.\nThe italics are my own.\nIn disallowing the deduction sought by the appellant for these expenses, Mr. Justice Cattanach adopted the reasoning of the majority of the House of Lords in Smith's Potato Estates Limited v. Bolland (Inspector of Taxes)[5], in which it was held that under Rule 3(a) Schedule D of the English Finance Act 1940, the expense incurred for legal and accounting costs in the preparation and prosecution of an appeal to the Board of Referees was not deductible in computing the taxable income of a taxpayer on the ground that the cost of ascertaining the true amount of tax to be paid is not an expense made in order to earn profits but rather an application of profits after they had been earned. The view of the majority of the Law Lords in this case which was later followed in the unanimous judgment of the House of Lords in Rushden Heel Co., Ltd. v. Inland Revenue Comrs.[6] is epitomized in the following paragraph from the reasons of Lord Simonds to which Cattanach J. has referred:\n\u2026Neither the cost of ascertaining taxable profit nor the cost of disputing it with the revenue authorities is money spent to enable the trader to earn profit in his trade. What profit he has earned, he has earned before ever the voice of the taxgatherer is heard. He would have earned no more and no less if there was no such thing as income tax.\nThe appellant sought to distinguish these cases from the present one on the ground that the wording of the English Rule 3(a) differs from s. 12(1) (a) of the Income Tax Act. The English Rule reads as follows:\nIn computing the amount of the profits or gains to be charged, no sum shall be deducted in respect of\n(a) disbursements or expenses, not being money wholly and exclusively laid out or expended for the purposes of the trade\u2026\nIt is to be noted, however, that the reasons of the majority in the Smith's Potato Estates Ltd. case were predicated on an acceptance of the interpretation placed on Rule 3(a) by Lord Davey in Strong & Co. v. Woodifield[7]. In that case Lord Davey, in commenting on the words \"wholly and exclusively laid out or expended for the purposes of the trade\" as they occur in Rule 3(a), had this to say:\nThese words\u2026 appear to me to mean for the purpose of enabling a person to carry on and earn profits in the trade.\nViewed in this light I am of opinion that the reasoning employed in the Smith's Potato Estates Ltd. case applies to the interpretation to be placed on s. 12(1) (a).\nIt was not until 1964, twelve years after the last payment of legal expenses had been made by the appellant in the present case that Canadian taxpayers were afforded relief from the effect of the Smith's Potato Estates Ltd. case, supra. In that year Parliament enacted section 11(1) (w) of the Income Tax Act, the relevant portions of which read as follows:\n11(1) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a), (b) and (h) of subsection (1) of section 12, the following amounts may be deducted in computing the income of a taxpayer for a taxation year:\n(w) Expenses of objection or appeal.\u2014amounts paid by the taxpayer in the year in respect of fees or expenses incurred in preparing, instituting or prosecuting an objection to, or an appeal in relation to, an assessment of tax, interest or penalties under this Act.\nIt has been suggested that the decision of this Court in the case of Evans v. Minister of National Revenue[8] affords some support for the contention of the appellant on this branch of the appeal, but that was not a case in which the taxpayer was seeking to deduct legal fees paid in respect of a dispute as to tax liability. There the taxpayer had incurred legal expenses in respect of an originating notice to the Supreme Court of Ontario for the opinion, advice and direction of the Court as to whether she was entitled to be paid income for life under the will of the father of her first husband. It was ultimately decided in the Ontario Court that she was so entitled and the very considerable legal fees were deducted by the trustee of the will out of the income to which she would otherwise have been entitled for the taxation year in question. The question at issue was whether in computing her income for that year the taxpayer was entitled to deduct those fees. The main question to be determined was whether the life interest to which the taxpayer was found to be entitled was a capital asset or whether it was income, and Cartwright J. who delivered the reasons for judgment on behalf of the majority of the Court held that it was income to which the taxpayer was entitled but the payment of which could not have been obtained without the expense of litigation, and he therefore allowed the deduction. It will be seen that these circumstances are very different from those in the present case, and I find it to be clearly distinguishable.\nIt is, however, argued on behalf of the appellant that even if it be accepted that such legal expenses are not deductible when they have been incurred to dispute a claim of the tax authorities of the taxpayer's own country, entirely different considerations apply when the outlay is made in order to determine the taxpayer's position in relation to a claim by a foreign government. In this regard, like the learned judge in the Exchequer Court, I am persuaded that the reasoning of the House of Lords in Inland Revenue Commissioners v. Dowdell O'Mahoney & Co., Ltd.[9] applies to such a claim. That was a case in which a company resident in Eire carried on business at two branches in England. The whole of its profits, including those arising from business in England, were subject in Eire to income tax and the company sought to deduct a proportion of the Eire taxes in computing the profits of the business in England for assessment of excess profits tax. In the course of his reasons for judgment disallowing the deduction, Lord Radcliffe appears to me to have come to the heart of the matter when he said at p. 543:\nBut, once it is accepted that the criterion is the purpose for which the expenditure is made in relation to the trade of which the profits are being computed, I have been unable to find any material distinction between a payment made to meet such taxes abroad and a payment made to meet a similar tax at home.\nThe italics are my own.\nIn the present case, as I have indicated, the purpose for which the expenditure was made concerned a claim for income tax in the United States in relation to profits made by the appellant in 1943 which the Canadian authorities had characterized as capital profits as well as a claim in respect of income which had been earned in the years 1945-1950 inclusive. These expenditures made in the years 1951 to 1952 do not appear to me to have been made \"for the purpose of gaining or producing income\" but rather for the purpose of preserving profits already earned by the appellant from a claim made by the United States tax authorities. The exceptional cases in which a taxpayer is permitted to deduct expenses when computing taxable income are confined by the terms of s. 12(1) (a) to expenses\n\u2026made or incurred by the taxpayer for the purpose of gaining or producing income. . .\nand except as otherwise expressly provided by s. 11, do not extend to expenses made for the purpose of preserving that income once it has been earned.\nThe effect of the provisions of s. 12(1)(a) is discussed and explained by Mr. Justice Abbott in the course of the reasons for judgment which he delivered on behalf of the majority of this Court in B. C. Electric Ry. Co. Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue[10], where he said:\nSince the main purpose of every business undertaking is presumably to make a profit, any expenditure made 'for the purpose of gaining or producing income' comes within the terms of s. 12(1)(a) whether it be classified as an income expense or as a capital outlay.\nOnce it is determined that a particular expenditure is one made for the purpose of gaining or producing income, in order to compute income tax liability it must next be ascertained whether such disbursement is an income expense or a capital outlay. The principle underlying such a distinction is, of course, that since for tax purposes income is determined on an annual basis, an income expense is one incurred to earn income of the particular year in which it is made and should be allowed as a deduction from gross income in that year.\nThe italics are my own.\nIt cannot in my opinion be said that the legal expense in question in the present case was incurred to earn the income of the particular year in which it was made and it should therefore not \"be allowed as a deduction from gross income in that year\".\nFor these reasons, as well as for those expressed in the opinion of Mr. Justice Cattanach, I would dismiss the appeal from the reassessment of the Minister of National Revenue with respect to legal expenses incurred in the years 1951 and 1952 in the resisting of the claim of the United States taxing authority.\nIn the result, the appeal in respect of the commissions paid in the years 1951 and 1952 is allowed and the appeal with respect to legal expenses in the same years is dismissed.\nAs the appellant has been substantially successful in this Court it will have the costs of this appeal together with the costs of the appeal to the Exchequer Court. The order as to costs of the cross appeal in the Exchequer Court will, of course, remain undisturbed.\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014I agree with my brother Ritchie that the commissions paid by the appellant to Mr. McFadyen in the years 1951 and 1952 were not taxable in the hands of the appellant. I agree with the conclusion reached by my brother Hall that the appellant was entitled to deduct as items of expense the amounts of $12,317.36 and $8,514.16, paid for legal expenses, in the years 1951 and 1952 respectively, when determining its taxable income in those two years. I have, however, reached this conclusion on somewhat narrower grounds than those which he has stated.\nThe reason for these payments is given in the judgment of the Tax Appeal Board, as follows:\nTurning to the second phase of the matter, the appellant learned some years after it had begun to sell ore in substantial quantities that the American revenue authorities had designs on its income on the alleged grounds that it had been earned in the United States of America and that the appellant had a permanent establishment there within the meaning of the Tax Convention and Protocol between Canada and the United States of America, signed on or about 4th March, 1942. The suggestion that tax liability obtained in the latter country was both surprising and startling to the appellant and steps were taken promptly to ascertain its legal position. It was a matter of great importance to the appellant as, if liability were to be established, the income relating to past, present and future years would be in jeopardy and, according to the evidence heard, in the event of the American claim proving successful, immense harm would be done to the appellant, financially. On this account, opinions were sought in Canada and the United States of America and great trouble was gone to and expense incurred in the latter country for the purpose of ascertaining all relevant facts and reaching a position in which the claim could be effectively opposed if it were proceeded with in the appropriate American court.\nThe relevant provisions of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148, are s. 12(1) (a) and (b) which provide:\n12. (1) In computing income, no deduction shall be made in respect of\n(a) an outlay or expense except to the extent that it was made or incurred by the taxpayer for the purpose of gaining or producing income from property or a business of the taxpayer,\n(b) an outlay, loss or replacement of capital, a payment on account of capital or an allowance in respect of depreciation, obsolescence or depletion except as expressly permitted by this Part,\nThe predecessor of s. 12(1) (a) was s. 6(1) (a) of the Income War Tax Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 97, which provided that:\n6. (1) In computing the amount of the profits or gains to be assessed, a deduction shall not be allowed in respect of\n(a) disbursements or expenses not wholly, exclusively and necessarily laid out or expended for the purpose of earning the income.\nIt seems clear that the present wording of para. (a), which first appeared in the 1948 Income Tax Act, 1948 (Can.), c. 52, was intended to broaden the definition of deductible expenses. The Income War Tax Act defined \"income\" as meaning \"the annual net profit or gain or gratuity.\" Under s. 6(1) (a), in computing such profit or gain it was only permissible to deduct expenses wholly, exclusively and necessarily expended for the purpose of earning that income. The present Act does not contain this definition of \"income.\" It frequently uses the phrase \"income for a taxation year\", which appears in s. 11(1) dealing with allowable deductions. The phrase does not appear in s. 12(1) (a) which, as now worded, permits the deduction of any expense made for the purpose of producing income from a property or business. Even under the narrower provisions of s. 6(1) (a) of the Income War Tax Act, legal expenses were deductible in the ordinary course as a current expenditure. This was stated by Duff C.J. in The Minister of National Revenue v. The Dominion Natural Gas Company Limited,[11] a case which involved the application of s. 6(1) (a) and (b) of the Income War Tax Act. The statement was affirmed by unanimous decision of this Court when he delivered the judgment in The Minister of National Revenue v. The Kellogg Company of Canada, Limited[12]. In that case the question in issue was as to the right of the Kellogg Company to claim as an expense, in determining its taxable income under the Income War Tax Act, legal fees incurred by it in successfully defending a suit for an injunction against alleged infringement of registered trade marks by using certain words in connection with the sale of its products. These expenses were held to be deductible under s. 6(1) (a) of that Act, and not to constitute an outlay or payment on account of capital within s. 6(1) (b). They fell within the general rule that in the ordinary course legal expenses are simply current expenditures and deductible as such.\nClearly these expenses were not made solely for the purpose of earning income in the year in which they were incurred. They did not directly result in the earning of income at all. But they were made with a view to protecting the income earning capacity of the company, since it must be assumed that the loss of the right to the use of the words in connection with its sales would have indirectly resulted in a reduction of its income, not only in the year in which they were incurred, but also in future years as well.\nIn Evans v. The Minister of National Revenue[13], the question in issue was as to the right to deduct, under s. 12(1) (a) of the Income Tax Act, legal expenses incurred by the appellant in connection with an application by the trustee of an estate for advice and directions. What the Court had to determine upon the application was the appellant's right to receive the income from a portion of the estate. Judgment on that application was given in 1954. There were appeals to the Court of Appeal for Ontario and to this Court. The final judgment was given in 1955 and the appellant sought to deduct from her income for that year her legal fees which she paid in that year.\nHere again, the expense was not one which was made solely for the purpose of earning income in that year. In the light of the decision of this Court, she had been entitled to that income all along. Such expense was made in order to protect her right to receive income, not only in 1955, but in each of the years in which income became available for distribution from the estate. This right was held not to be a capital asset, and the expense in question did not fall within s. 12(1) (b). Such expense was held to be properly incurred within s. 12(1) (a) for the purpose of gaining an income to which the appellant was entitled.\nIn the present case the legal fees paid by the appellant were expended with a view to resisting the claim of the American government that the appellant had a permanent establishment in the United States and so was liable for the payment of income tax there. As stated in the reasons of the Tax Appeal Board, previously cited:\nIt was a matter of great importance to the appellant as, if liability were to be established, the income relating to past, present and future years would be in jeopardy, and, according to the evidence heard, in the event of the American claim proving successful, immense harm would be done to the appellant, financially.\nI have great difficulty in seeing how, in principle, this expense for legal services, made as it was for the purpose of protecting the appellant's income, can be regarded as being different from that which was held to be properly deductible in the Kellogg case and also in the Evans case. The disbursement made was not an outlay or replacement of capital, nor a payment on account of capital, within s. 12(1) (b). The claim of the American government was not in respect of the appellant's capital, but a claim which, if established, would have created a liability in relation to its income. It is true that the American government considered as taxable income items of profit which had not been so regarded in Canada, but the basis of the claim was in respect of income. It is also true that the disbursement was made to protect profits earned in years prior to the year in which the disbursement was made as well as the income of that and subsequent years. But in the light of the present wording of s. 12(1) (a) and its application in the Evans case, this does not prevent this expense from being deducti- ble. In both that case and the Kellogg case the expense involved was to establish a right to receive income, or for the protection of income in other years as well as that of the year in which the expenditure was made.\nThe learned trial judge refused to allow the deduction of these expenses because he felt that the matter was determined by the judgment of the House of Lords in Smith's Potato Estates Limited v. Bolland (Inspector of Taxes)[14]. In that case, by a majority of three to two, the appellant was held not to be entitled, in determining its taxable income, to deduct legal and accountancy expenses made to contest an assessment to excess profits tax.\nAssuming, without agreeing, that the reasoning of the majority should be preferred to that of the minority, I do not agree that that case is a parallel to the present one. The relevant statutory provision in that case was materially different from s. 12(1) (a) of our Act. The English statute only permitted deduction of:\nmoney wholly and exclusively laid out and expended for the purposes of the trade.\nReference to the words which I have italicized, as compared with the wording of our s. 12(1) (a), indicates that the English provision was much narrower in its scope.\nThe Smith case was concerned with legal expenses made by an English company in England with a view to reducing its liability for tax in England. The effect of the decision is that an expenditure by a trader for legal fees incurred for the purpose of contesting an assessment of income tax cannot, as against the assessor of that tax, be claimed as money wholly and exclusively expended for the purpose of the trade. But that is not this case. The expense incurred here was for the purpose of resisting the demands of a foreign taxing authority, which, had it succeeded, would have substantially depleted the income of a Canadian company. In my opinion, a claim of that kind is a claim by a third party. The resistance of the claim is an attempt to protect Canadian income, and it matters not, so far as the Canadian taxing authority is concerned, that the nature of the claim is one for income tax. In so far as the Canadian taxing authority is concerned, I can see no difference, in principle, between an expenditure in the form of legal fees paid by a railway company to defend a damage claim by a passenger, and thus to protect the company's income, and the expenditure for legal fees paid by the appellant to resist a foreign tax claim and thus to protect its income. The former type of expense is admittedly properly deductible.\nThe other authority relied upon by the learned trial judge, also a decision of the House of Lords, was Inland Revenue Commissioners v. Dowdell O'Mahoney & Co. Ltd.[15]. That case is also distinguishable. It dealt with a claim by an Irish company, doing business in England, to deduct, in computing its excess profits tax in England, tax paid by it in Ireland. This claim was refused. The case does not involve legal fees at all. The payment of the Irish tax was not made with a view to resisting a claim which would reduce its income.\nIn my opinion a payment made for legal services in an attempt to protect income against encroachment by a third party is, in principle, on the authority of the Kellogg and Evans cases in this Court, properly deductible.\nI would allow the appeal in toto, with costs throughout.\nHALL J.:\u2014I have had the opportunity of reading the reasons for judgment of my brother Ritchie and I agree with him that the commissions paid by the appellant to Mr. McFadyen in the years 1951 and 1952 were not taxable in the hands of the appellant. However, with respect, I disagree as to the $20,832.51 paid in the two years in question as legal expenses incurred as a result of an unwarranted claim for income tax and capital gains tax amounting to between two and three million dollars by the United States Internal Revenue Service which claim was successfully resisted resulting in this very substantial saving to the appellant, or, put differently, the working capital of the appellant and its profit earning potential were preserved by the rejection of this unjustified demand. Had the claim succeeded, according to the witness Daly whose evidence was not challenged, it would have taken up nearly all the income of the appellant, leaving the appellant unable to carry out its obligations under the sales contract of January 15, 1943, and to earn the income needed to sustain its operations. Mr. Justice Cattanach[16] dealt with this item as follows:\nIt is well settled that the legal costs incurred in disputing a claim for income tax may not be allowed as a deduction in computing business profits. In Smith's Potato Estates, Ltd., v. Bolland, (1948) 2 All E.R. 367 Lord Simonds said at page 374:\n\"\u2026neither the cost of ascertaining taxable profit nor the cost of disputing it with the revenue authorities is money spent to enable the trader to earn profit in his trade. What profit he has earned, he has earned before ever the voice of the taxgatherer is heard. He would have earned no more and no less if there was no such thing as income tax \u2026\"\nI cannot accept the proposition that \"it is well settled that the legal costs incurred in disputing a claim for income tax may not be allowed as a deduction in computing business profits\".\nCattanach J. quotes Lord Simonds in Smith's Potato Estates case[17], but he also said on the same page:\nMy Lords, I suppose that few expressions have been discussed more often in the courts than that which you have once again to consider, \"money wholly and exclusively laid out or expended for the purposes of the trade,\" but it is their application rather than their meaning that is in doubt. I agree with the submission of learned counsel that it does not help to substitute other words for those which are found in the statute and then to put a gloss on those other words, but it is, I think, important to emphasize that the words \"for the purposes of the trade\" in their context, i.e., where a computation of \"profits\" for the ascertainment of taxable income is being made, must mean \"for the purpose of enabling a person to carry on and earn profits in the trade.\" These familiar words I cite from LORD DAVEY'S speech in Strong & Co. Ltd. v. Woodifield ((1906) A.C. 448, 453). They have been cited and applied over and over again, and, if they are kept firmly in mind, they dispose in limine of the argument which prevailed with ATKINSON J., and has been urged before your Lordships.\nIt will be seen that Lord Simonds adopts a phrase from Lord Davey's speech in Strong & Co., Ltd. v. Woodifield[18].\nStrong v. Woodifield was a case where the taxpayers, innkeepers, were seeking to deduct costs and damages paid to a person staying in their inn who was injured by the fall of a chimney. I do not think it has ever been successfully contended in Canada that damages and costs payable by a common carrier or by an occupier to an invitee or licensee or in any similar circumstances were not proper deductions in arriving at the taxable income of such a taxpayer. I understood counsel for the Minister to concede that such deductions are not challenged. Even in Strong v. Woodifield Lord Loreburn said at p. 452:\nIn my opinion, however, it does not follow that if a loss is in any sense connected with the trade, it must always be allowed as a deduction; for it may be only remotely connected with the trade, or it may be connected with something else quite as much as or even more than with the trade. I think only such losses can be deducted as are connected with in the sense that they are really incidental to the trade itself. They cannot be deducted if they are mainly incidental to some other vocation or fall on the trader in some character other than that of trader. The nature of the trade is to be considered. To give an illustration, losses sustained by a railway company in compensating passengers for accidents in travelling might be deducted. On the other hand, if a man kept a grocer's shop, for keeping which a house is necessary, and one of the window shutters fell upon and injured a man walking in the street, the loss arising thereby to the grocer ought not to be deducted. Many cases might be put near the line, and no degree of ingenuity can frame a formula so precise and comprehensive as to solve at sight all the cases that may arise.\nand Lord James of Hereford said at p. 454:\nThe only question is as to the application of that principle in one small matter to the facts of this case. If the fact were that the accident had occurred to a stranger walking in the street, then I should have no doubt at all. The doubt that did arise in my mind was as to the rule applicable when the accident occurred to a person who was a customer in the house who would not have been injured unless the business of an innkeeper was being carried on, and when it was in the course of the carrying on of a portion of that business that the customer injured was there; then I think a different principle might arise, and my doubts consequently existed.\nNow reverting to Smith's Potato Estate case, Viscount Simon said regarding Lord Davey's statement in Strong v. Woodifield at p. 369:\nIt seems to me that it is essential for the proper carrying on of a trade that the trader should know what portion of his profits in a given year is left to him after the Revenue has taken its share by taxation. If, therefore, he considers that the Revenue seeks to take too large a share and to leave him with too little, the expenditure which the trader incurs in endeavouring to correct this mistake is a disbursement laid out for the purposes of his trade. If he succeeds, he will have more money with which to earn profits next year. It is true that the result of his success is to reduce the tax he had to pay\u2014alternatively, one may say that the result is to show that the profit of the years trading left to him after paying tax is greater than the Revenue was willing to admit\u2014but, to my mind, the purpose was a trading purpose and nothing else. The trade is not to be regarded as extending over twelve months and no more. Indeed, as I have already pointed out, excess profits tax is liable to be adjusted in the light of subsequent trading results, and assessment for income tax is arrived at on figures of the previous year. With all respect to those who think otherwise, I regard it as fallacious to argue that the trader's expenditure in fighting the Revenue's assessment is not \"wholly and exclusively\" incurred for the purposes of the trade because the expenditure would not be incurred if there was no tax to pay. If there was no tax to pay, the benefit realised by the trader from carrying on the trade would not be reduced by taxation, and it is the purpose of trade (at any rate, under private enterprise) to make its legitimate profit.\nViewed in this light, I do not see why the expenditure here in question is not wholly and exclusively laid out for the purposes of the trade\u2014if it had not been incurred, the trade would be less profitable. LORD DAVEY'S gloss on the words of the statute in Strong & Co., Ltd. v. Woodifield (1) ((1906) A.C. 448, 453) is well known, but I think it is better to concentrate on the statutory words themselves. Rightly understood, however, I do not find that LORD DAVEY'S words contradict the view I am disposed to take. Strong & Co., Ltd. v. Woodifield (1) was a case in which the taxpayer sought to deduct a loss not connected with or arising out of his trade. LORD LOREBURN said (ibid., 452): \"I think only such losses can be deducted as are connected with, in the sense that they are really incidental to, the trade itself.\" LORD DAVEY'S test was that the purpose of the expenditure must be \"the purpose of enabling a person to carry on and earn profits in the trade\u2026\" (ibid., 453). Here, the expenditure was, in my view, incurred for the purpose of carrying on and earning profits in the trade, for a reduction in the amount of tax does increase the fund in the trader's hands after tax is paid and so promotes the carrying on of the trade and the earning of trading profits. The incidental consequence that the trader is not taxed so heavily in respect of his profits from trade does not, as it seems to me, alter the fact that the litigation was wholly and exclusively undertaken for the purposes of the trade.\nLord Oaksey in the same case said at p. 377:\nMy Lords, the question in this appeal is whether the costs of litigation undertaken for the purpose of arriving at the true profits of a trade for the purposes of taxation are proper deductions in order to arrive at the balance of profits and gains or as expenses wholly and exclusively laid out or expended for the purposes of the trade within the meaning of 3. (a) of the Rules Applicable to Cases I and II of sched. D to the Income Tax Act, 1918. The contention on behalf of the Crown is that no expenses connected with taxation are deductible because it is said they are not expended for the purposes of the trade and it is sought to limit the words \"the purposes of the trade\" to the purpose of earning the profits of the trade by the operations of the trade. Reliance is placed on the dictum of LORD DAVEY in Strong & Co., Ltd. v. Woodifield (1) ((1906) A.C. 448, 453), which has frequently been cited with approval in other cases, but it is to be observed that LORD DAVEY did not say earning the profits by the operations of the trade and, in my opinion, the words \"the purposes of the trade\" ought not to be construed in this way. A trader does not expend money in an action brought for or against him for negligence or breach of contract in the course of his trade for the purpose of earning the profits of the trade in this sense, for it is not an operation of his trade to engage in litigation. It is, of course, an incident which he may think reasonably necessary for the purposes of his trade to bring or defend actions, but so it is an incident which he may think reasonably necessary for the purposes of his trade to engage in litigation as to the amount of his taxes. If he succeeds in either case he increases the profits arising from his trade, and it appears to me to be no straining of language to say that a trader who increases his profits by incurring a certain expense incurs that expense for the purpose of earning the profits.\nIn my opinion, the real question which has to be decided in every case is whether the expense is one which is incurred in order to earn gain or profit from the trade, or is the application of the gain or profit when earned: see per LORD SELBORNE, L.C. in Mersey Docks & Harbour Board v. Lucas (6) ((1883) 8 App. Cas. 891, 906), and, in my opinion, it cannot be truly said that the expense of paying accountants or of litigating the question of what is the balance of profits and gains for the purposes of taxation is the application of these profits. Profits cannot properly be applied or divided until they are ascertained, and every expense which is properly incurred for the ascertainment of profits is, in my opinion, an expense of earning the profits and not an application of them. That is not to say that all expenses which are incurred in point of time before the profits are ascertained can be deducted. The point of time is unimportant. Some expenses which are clearly the application or distribution of profits may be incurred before the ascertainment of profits, e.g., capital investments or payments of interim dividends, but it is the character of the expense which must be considered. The expense in this case was not a capital investment. It was incurred, not to distribute, but to increase, and, in that sense, to earn, the profits. On the other hand, if it is to be held that such expenses are not deductible, what is to be said of the costs of audit which the Companies Acts make necessary or of that part of the cost of bookkeeping which is used in the preparation of such an audit or of accounts for taxation? They are not incurred for the purposes of earning the profits of the trade in the limited sense contended for by the Crown. It is said that the expense of litigating questions of taxation has never been sought to be deducted, and it may be so, but it is also true that the expense of paying accountants and auditors has been deducted, and, in any event, the fact, if it be the fact, throws no legal light on the construction of the words in question.\nThe judgment in Smith's Potato Estate case is persuasive and entitled to respect, but as Lord Oaksey says, Lord Davey's statement in Strong v. Woodifield, relied on so strongly by the majority was dictum (p. 377).\nI cannot accept the majority judgment in Smith's Potato Estates case as being the correct statement of the law as applied to the provisions of the Income Tax Act. It will be observed that the English rule differs somewhat in wording from the Canadian Act. The former reads:\nIn computing the amount of the profits or gains to be charged, no sum shall be deducted in respect of\n(a) disbursements or expenses, not being money wholly and exclusively laid out or expended for the purposes of the trade\u2026\nThe latter reads:\n12. (1) In computing income no deduction shall be made in respect of\n(a) an outlay or expense except to the extent that it was made or incurred by the taxpayer for the purpose of gaining or producing income from property or a business of the taxpayer. It cannot be overlooked that Parliament, in enacting s. 12(1) (a), did not include the words 'not wholly, exclusively and necessarily laid out or expended' which were in s. 6 of the Income War Tax Act prior to 1948 and which are found almost verbatim in the English counterpart quoted above except for the word \"necessarily\". Consequently, the English decisions like Strong v. Woodifield and all those founded on Strong v. Woodifield based on the wording of the English rule cannot now be invoked as wholly applicable and indistinguishable in the interpretation of s. 12(1) (a). Some significance must be given to the difference in wording noted above and to the change in wording when the Income Tax Act was enacted in 1948. The statement by Abbott J. in B.C. Electric Railway Co. Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue[19],\nThe less stringent provisions of the new section should, I think, be borne in mind in considering judicial opinions based upon the former sections.\npoints up the error that may arise from an unquestioned acceptance of such cases as Smith's Potato Estates as being completely applicable in Canada after 1948. In that year the words 'wholly, exclusively and necessarily' were replaced with the much broader 'made or incurred for the purpose of gaining or producing income from property or a business'. The limitation, spelled out in s. 12(1) (a), does not, in referring to 'producing income from the property or business of a taxpayer', limit the words quoted solely to the taxation year in which the deduction is being claimed. It is a clear indication to me that the income thus referred to may be the income of the taxation year under review or of a succeeding year.\nA company such as the appellant exists to make a profit. All its operations are directed to that end. The operations must be viewed as one whole and not segregated into revenue producing as distinct from revenue retaining functions, otherwise a condition of chaos would obtain. For example, is the function of the Paymaster's Department to be considered as directly relating to the production of income, which it undoubtedly is, as distinct from the Audit Department which scrutinizes the disbursements made by the Paymaster? What of the sophisticated systems of internal and external audits adopted by commercial companies to assure that the income received by the company is properly retained? What of security arrangements to protect income already earned? What of claims against, say, a shopping centre for damages sustained by a customer or claimed to have been sustained and the legal costs of investigating and defending such claims? Counsel for the Minister freely admitted that these are routinely allowed as expenses incurred in earning \"the income\".\n\"The income\" surely means the net receipts over disbursements in the taxation year in the totality of the taxpayer's business as an on-going concern other than capital expenditures, gifts and the like. I can see no reason to regard legal expenses as differing from other expenses in that they differ solely by the fact that they are disbursements paid to lawyers as distinct from payments made to auditors or to accountants and others for work done in preparing the yearly income tax returns, or premiums paid for insurance to indemnify the taxpayer from loss by fire or from negligence or liability imposed by law. In my view, no distinction is to be drawn between proper legal expenses and other business expenses. All must be tested by the same standards.\nCanadian courts have not always accepted the result in Strong v. Woodifield. Angers J. in Hudson's Bay Company v. Minister of National Revenue1 made an exhaustive review of many cases, including Strong v. Woodifield. The facts in the Hudson Bay case were that a company calling itself Hudson Bay Fur Company was organized to deal in furs in the States of Oregon and Washington and for a time operated two stores in Seattle, Washington. The Hudson Bay Company took action in the State of Washington to restrain Hudson Bay Fur Company from interfering with its trade and it was successful. It paid out for legal costs in connection with that action the sum of $10,377 in 1938 and $22,952.80 in 1939 and included these disbursements as deductible expenses in its income tax returns for the said years. The Minister disallowed these deductions and Hudson Bay Company appealed the disallowances. Section 6 of the Income War Tax Act then read:\n(1) In computing the amount of the profits or gains to be assessed, a deduction shall not be allowed in respect of\n(a) disbursements or expenses not wholly, exclusively and necessarily laid out or expended for the purpose of earning the income,\n(b) any outlay, loss or replacement of capital or any payment on account of capital or any depreciation, depletion or absolescence, except as otherwise provided in this Act.\nAngers J. at pp. 148-9 said:\nCan the expenses or costs paid out by the appellant in the circumstances hereinabove related be considered as disbursements or expenses \"wholly, exclusively and necessarily laid out or expended for the purpose of earning the income\"? This is the question which I have to solve.\nCounsel for the appellant in his argument pointed out that the Minister, assisted by a very able staff, did not think at first that there was any objection to the legal costs and expenses in issue being deducted from the income and the return was accepted. He submitted that it was only when the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of The Minister of National Revenue v. Dominion Natural Gas Company Limited, (1941) S.C.R. 19, was rendered that the Minister changed his mind, reopened the assessment and disallowed the deduction of the said costs and expenses.\nCounsel intimated that the reassessment was made on an erroneous view of what was decided in the Minister of National Revenue v. Dominion Natural Gas Company Limited case and that, if the case of Income Tax Commissioner v. Singh, (1942) 1 A.E.R. 262, had been decided before the Minister of National Revenue v. Dominion Natural Gas Company Limited case, the decision of the Supreme Court in the latter case might have been different. Counsel suggested that the Supreme Court thought that they were compelled to give judgment against their own opinions possibly, because they considered themselves bound by some remarks of the Privy Council. He drew the conclusion that it is clear, according to the judgment in the case of Income Tax Commissioner v. Singh, that the Privy Council did not intend to lay down any such rule as that suggested in the Supreme Court judgment.\nCounsel for respondent on the other hand relied on the case of Minister of National Revenue v. Dominion Natural Gas Company Limited, among several others, and it seems convenient to analyze it first.\nIt is important to note that at p. 25 of Minister of National Revenue v. Dominion Natural Gas Company Limited, Duff C.J.C. said:\nIn the ordinary course, it is true, legal expenses are simply current expenditure and deductible as such; but that is not necessarily so. The legal expenses incurred, for example, in procuring authority for reduction of capital were held by the Court of Sessions not to be deductible in Thomson v. Batty ((1919) S.C. 289).\nand Mr. Justice Crocket said at p. 26:\nIf we were free to decide this appeal on considerations of practical business sense and equity, or to deduce from decided cases the governing rule, which should be applied in determining whether the respondent was or was not entitled, under the formula prescribed by s. 6 of the Canadian Income War Tax Act, to the deduction claimed in computing its assessable profits or gains for the year 1934, I should have no hesitation in adopting the conclusion at which the learned President of the Exchequer Court arrived and the reasons he has given therefor. We are confronted, however, with a recent judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the case of the appeal of Tata Hydro-Electric Agencies, Ltd., Bombay, v. Commissioner of Income Tax, Bombay Presidency and Aden ((1937) A.C. 685) in which a test, formulated in 1924 by Lord President Clyde of the Scottish Court of Session in the case of Robert Addie & Sons Collieries, Ltd. v. Commissioners of Inland Revenue ((1924) S.C. 231), for determining whether a deduction is allowable under practically identical provisions of the English Income Tax Act, 1918, is expressly adopted and applied. The English Act of 1918, ch. 40, 8 & 9 Geo. V. by rule 3 of Schedule \"D\", prohibits deductions in respect of \"any disbursements or expenses, not being money wholly and exclusively laid out or expended for the purposes of the trade, profession, employment or vocation,\" or in respect of \"any capital withdrawn from, or any sum employed or intended to be employed as capital in such trade,\" etc., as well as other specified capital expenditures for improvements and the like, the effect of which, as regards this case, it seems to be impossible to distinguish from the prohibitions (a) and (b) of s. 6 of the Canadian Act. I apprehend, therefore, that the test so distinctly adopted by the Judicial Committee in the Tata case ((1937) A.C. 685) is binding upon us.\nMaclean P. in the Dominion Natural Gas case at pp. 19 and 20 said:\nIt seems to me that if legal expenses are incurred in successfully defending an action in which one's title to existing assets, rights or facilities are put in serious question, such expenses should normally be admissible as deductions, and particularly would this be so in the case where the earning of profits are directly dependent upon and require the utilization of such assets, rights or facilities, as was the case here. If the action is unsuccessfully defended the revenue authorities might contend that there was no asset, right or facility to defend, and that therefore such expenses should not be allowed as a deduction in computing net taxable income, but that is not this case. If such expenses arose out of the promotion or acquisition of additional assets, rights or facilities, it is probable no deduction would be permissible. It was imperative here that the Dominion Company defend the action and the failure of its directors to do so would probably have rendered themselves liable in damages to the shareholders of that company. The action threatened the earnings of the Dominion Company, wholly or partially, and had the action succeeded it would have been unable to sell gas, at least in some sections of the City of Hamilton; the company's capacity to earn revenue was put in jeopardy and, I think, it is immaterial that its capital assets, or some of them, were incidentally threatened with extinction or depreciation. It was because the Dominion Company was producing and selling gas that it had to defend the action and thus protect and preserve its credit and its revenue. The United Company sought an injunction restraining the Dominion Company from continuing to supply gas to the inhabitants of the City of Hamilton, which, had the United Company been successful, would have prevented the Dominion Company from earning its usual revenue.\nThe Supreme Court reversed Maclean P. because they felt bound by Tata Hydro-Electric Agencies, Ltd.[20] (see remarks of Crocket J. above).\nAngers J. in the Hudson Bay Company case dealt at length with the Tata decision at pp. 156, 157 and 158 and concluded by saying that the Tata decision had very little, if any, weight in the circumstances of the Hudson Bay Company case. The facts in Tata were:\n\u2026the appellant was a private limited company carrying on the business of managing agents of Tata Power Co. Ltd. and other hydro-electric companies. The company acquired this agency business from Tata Sons Ltd. under an assignment whereby the latter transferred to the appellant their rights and interest as agents of the hydro-electric companies under their subsisting agreement with them, but subject, as to their rights and interest under their agreement with Tata Power Co. Ltd., to their obligations under two agreements with F. E. Dinshaw Ltd. and Richard T. Smith. The assignment declared that the appellant should thenceforth be and act as the agents of the hydro-electric companies and be entitled to all benefits conferred by the agreement between Tata Sons Ltd. and these companies and should perform all the obligations thereby imposed and that the appellant should receive all the commissions to which Tata Sons Ltd. were entitled thereunder. The appellant agreed to carry out the conditions of the agreements with F. E. Dinshaw Ltd. and Richard T. Smith and to indemnify Tata Sons Ltd. against any consequences of the non-observance thereof. Under the agency agreement between Tata Sons Ltd. and Tata Power Co. Ltd., the benefit whereof the appellant acquired, the remuneration of Tata Sons Ltd. for their services consisted of a commission of 10 per cent on the annual net profits of Tata Power Co. Ltd., with a minimum of Rs. 50,000 whether the company should make any profits or not, and they were entitled to have their expenses reimbursed. In return, Tata Sons Ltd. undertook to endeavour to promote the interests of Tata Power Co. Ltd. The agreement was declared assignable and Tata Power Co. Ltd. undertook to recognize any assignees as its agents and, if required, to enter into an identical agreement with such assignees. In 1926, Tata Power Co. Ltd., being in need of financial assistance, Tata Sons Ltd., its then managing agents, approached F. E. Dinshaw Ltd. and Richard T. Smith, who agreed to provide the necessary funds. One of the conditions on which they agreed to do so was that in addition to the interest payable by Tata Power Co. Ltd. for the loan, they should each receive from Tata Sons Ltd. two annas in the rupee or 12 1\/2 per cent of the commission earned by Tata Sons Ltd. under their agreement with Tata Power Co. Ltd. Agreements were entered into between Tata Sons Ltd. and F. E. Dinshaw Ltd. and between Tata Sons Ltd. and Richerd T. Smith dated October 15 and 19, 1926, respectively. After the acquisition of the agency business by the appellant the Tata Power Co. Ltd., in fulfilment of its obligation under the agreement with Tata Sons Ltd., entered into a new agency agreement with the appellant in terms identical with those of its previous agreement with Tata Sons Ltd. and the appellant also entered into agreements with F. E. Dinshaw Ltd. and the administrator of the estate of Richard T. Smith, who had died in the meantime, in terms identical with those of the previous agreements between Tata Sons Ltd. and these parties. By these transactions the appellant came in the place and stead of Tata Sons Ltd., both as regards the right to receive from Tata Power Co. Ltd. the agency remuneration and as regards the obligation to pay out of its remuneration 12& per cent to F. E. Dinshaw Ltd. and 12& per cent to the administrator of Richard T. Smith's estate. The assessment of appellant's income for the fiscal year to March 31, 1934, is based on its income, profits and gains for the year 1932 and the question is whether in the computation for tax purposes of its income, profits and gains for that year it is entitled to deduct a sum representing the 25 per cent of the commission earned and received from Tata Power Co. Ltd. which it paid to F. E. Dinshaw Ltd. and Richard T. Smith's administrator.\nIt was held that in computing its income, profits and gains, the appellant was not entitled to deduct the 25 per cent in question; that this percentage of the commission paid to F. E. Dinshaw Ltd. and the administrator of Richard T. Smith's estate was not expenditure incurred by appellant \"solely for the purpose of earning\u2026profits or gains\" of its business; that the obligation to make the payments was undertaken by appellant in consideration of its acquisition of the right and opportunity to earn profits, i.e. of the right to conduct the business, and not for the purpose of producing profits in the conduct of the business.\nI am bound to paraphrase Angers J. in saying that in my opinion the Tata case has little, if any, relevance to the present case except that it may resemble it on the first question upon which we all agree the Minister fails.\nThe following quotation from Angers J. starting at p. 166 is very helpful:\nThere are two cases in which the judgments were delivered subsequently to the hearing by the Supreme Court of the case of the Minister of National Revenue and Dominion Natural Gas Company. These cases, in my opinion, offer as much relevancy to the problem at issue herein as those previously referred to and they certainly deserve being noted.\nThe first of these cases is that of Southern v. Borax Consolidated, Ltd., (1940) 4 A.E.R. 412.\nThe respondent purchased certain property for the purposes of its business. Subsequently an action was taken against the company claiming that its title was invalid. The company defended the action and incurred legal expenses amounting to 6,249\u20a4, which it claimed to be entitled to deduct as business expenses in computing its profits for the purposes of assessment to income tax.\nThe Crown contended that the action concerned the capital assets of the company and was contested in order to preserve the existence of those assets and that the sum of 6,249& was a capital expense.\nThe King's Bench Division (Lawrence, J.) held that the expense had been incurred, not in creating any new asset, but in maintaining the title to the company's property and was, therefore, an expense wholly and exclusively incurred for the purposes of the company's trade and, as such, properly deductible. Lawrence J., after reviewing the precedents cited by counsel, concluded as follows (p. 419):\n\"It appears to me that the legal expenses which were incurred by the respondent company did not create any new asset at all, but were expenses which were incurred in the ordinary course of maintaining the assets of the company, and the fact that it was maintaining the title, and not the value, of the company's business does not make it any different.\"\nThe second case is Income Tax Commissioner v. Singh (exactly Maharajadhiraj Sir Rameshwar Singh of Darbhanga) (1942) 1 A.E.R. 362.\nIn this case the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council affirmed the judgment of the High Court of Judicature at Patna, India, which had decided a reference made to it, at the request of the respondent, in favour of the latter.\nThe summary of the judgment, fairly comprehensive and exact, may advantageously be quoted:\n\"The respondent's father made a loan of 10 lakhs of rupees to a company in which he was a shareholder, and recovered this loan in an action, the costs of which were allowed as an expense incurred in his moneylending business in the assessment of his income tax. Certain shareholders in the company brought an action against the respondent's father and others for conspiracy, collusion, misrepresentation, and breach of contract. The basis of this action was an alleged transaction, of which the loan was part, whereby the respondent's father agreed to finance and manage the company. The action was dismissed, the version of what took place relied upon by the plaintiffs being found to be completely false. The respondent's father died before the conclusion of the suit, and the respondent who continued his business claimed to deduct the costs in arriving at the assessment of profits. The appellant contended that there was no connection between the loan and the alleged transaction which was the basis of the action against the respondent's father, the action being of a personal character and unrelated to his business as a moneylender:\nHeld: the respondent was entitled to make the deduction claimed. The allegations against the respondent's father were built up upon the transaction in which the loan was made, and the defence of the action was necessary for the protection of his rights as the creditor in the loan.\"\nLord Thankerton, who delivered the judgment of the Court, stated (p. 365, in fine):\n\"Their Lordships are, therefore, of opinion that the facts stated by the commissioner cannot justify the opinion expressed by him, but that the expenditure in question was incurred solely for the purpose of earning the profits or gains of the moneylending business, and that the High Court are right in holding the respondent entitled to the deduction claimed and in answering the question of law asked by the commissioner in favour of the respondent.\"\nAngers J. concluded by allowing the deductions. No appeal was taken from his judgment. The decision in Kellogg Company of Canada Limited and the Minister of National Revenue[21] is very helpful. Angers J. deals with it at pp. 177-8 as follows:\n\u2026the appellant, a manufacturer of cereal products, and one of its customers were made defendants in an action brought by Canadian Shredded Wheat Company which claimed infringement by both defendants of certain trade mark rights and asked for an injunction restraining them from using the words \"Shredded Wheat\" or \"Shredded Whole Wheat\" or \"Shredded Whole Wheat Biscuit\" or any words only colourably differing therefrom and damages. The appellant successfully defended the action on behalf of both defendants. In computing its income for 1936 and 1937 the appellant deducted the sums of money paid out for legal expenses on account of said action. These deductions were disallowed by the Commissioner of Income Tax. The latter's disallowance was naturally affirmed by the Minister of National Revenue, from whose decision an appeal was taken to the Court. It was held that the payments were made involuntarily in the course of business to enable the appellant to continue the sales of its products as before action was taken against it and not to secure or preserve an actual asset or enduring advantage to appellant.\nA brief extract from the judgment of Maclean J. may be convenient (p. 43):\n\"The broad principle laid down by Lord Cave in British Insulated v. Atherton, (1926) A.C. 205 at 213, is not, in my opinion, of any assistance in the present case. Applying that test to the present case, the payment here made was not, I think, an expenditure incurred or made \"once and for all\", with a view of bringing a new asset into existence, nor can it, in my opinion, properly be said that it brought into existence an advantage for the enduring benefit of Kellogg's trade within the meaning of the well known language used by Lord Dave in a certain passage of his speech in that case. What the House of Lords was considering in that case was a sum irrevocably set aside as a nucleus of a pension fund established by a trust deed for the benefit of the company's clerical staff, and, as was said by Lawrence L. J. in the Anglo Persian Oil Company Limited v. Dale case, (1932) 1 K.B. 124, I have no doubt that Lord Cave had that fact in mind when he spoke of an advantage for the enduring benefit of the company's trade. Such an expenditure differs fundamentally from the expenditure with which we are concerned in the present case. Here, the expenditure brought no such permanent advantage into existence for the taxpayer's trade. I do not think it can be said that the expenditure in question here brought into existence any asset that could possibly appear as such in any balance sheet, or that it procured an enduring advantage for the taxpayer's trade which must pre-suppose that something was acquired which had no prior existence.\"\nAfter stating that the case of Kellogg and the Minister of National Revenue closely resembles that of Mitchell v. B. W. Noble Limited, (1927) 1 K.B. 719, in which a large sum of money was expended by a company to get rid of a managing director, and quoting passages from the reasons of the Master of the Rolls and of Lord Justice Sargent, which I do not deem necessary to transcribe here and which may be easily referred to, Maclean J. declared that these remarks would appear to be applicable and added (p. 45):\n\"Here, Kellogg had encountered a business difficulty, one associated directly with the sales branch of its business, which it had to get rid of, if possible, in order to continue the sales of its products as it had in the past.\"\nAn appeal was taken by the Minister of National Revenue and the same was dismissed (1943) S.C.R. 58. Sir Lyman Duff, who delivered the judgment of the Court, after referring to the case of the Minister of National Revenue v. The Dominion Natural Gas Company, Limited, made, among others, the following statements (p. 60):\n\"The present appeal concerns expenditures made by the respondent company in payment of the costs of litigation between that company and the Canadian Shredded Wheat Company.\n***\nAs regards this payment, the question in issue was whether or not the registered trade marks of the plaintiffs in the action were valid trade marks, or, in other words, whether or not the present respondents, the Kellogg Company, and all other members of the public were excluded from the use of the words in respect of which the complaint was made. The right upon which the respondents relied was not a right of property, or an exclusive right of any description, but the right (in common with all other members of the public) to describe their goods in the manner in which they were describing them.\"\nHalsbury, 3rd ed., at p. 168, states as part of para. 287:\nLegal expenses have been allowed where they did not create a new asset but maintained a company's title to land abroad (h) Southern v. Borax Consolidated, Ltd., (1941) 1. K.B. 111; (1940) 4 All E.R. 214; 23 T. C. 597, and where they were incurred by a moneylender in protection of his rights as a creditor for a loan (i) (Income Tax Commissioners (Bihar and Orissa) v. Singh, (1942) 1 All E.R. 362, P.C., Sums paid by a company to settle an action for fraud in connection with its trade have also been allowed, together with incidental legal expenses (k) (Golder (Inspector of Taxes) v. Great Boulder Proprietary Gold Mines, Ltd., (1952) 1 All E.R. 360; 33 T. C. 75.)\nand again on p. 169:\nThough it is clear that the expenses allowable are such only as are necessary to earn the receipts of the trade (u), (Russell v. Town and County Bank (1888) 13 App. Cas. 418, at p. 424; 2 T.C. 321, at p. 327, per LORD HERSCHELL: Gresham Life Assurance Society v. Styles, (1892) A. C. 309, H. L., at p. 316; 3. T.C. 185, at p. 189; and see p. 166, ante.), this proposition must be applied in a reasonable way, and must not be construed so as to preclude the deduction of those expenses as a result of which receipts or profits may accrue in the future. For example, the cost of a reasonable amount of advertising is usually admitted as a business expense, although the result of a particular advertisement might not be reflected in an increase in trade receipts in the year in which the cost was incurred. The principle is that expenses to earn future profits are allowable deductions (a),\n(a) Vallambrosa Rubber Co., Ltd. v. Farmer (Surveyor of Taxes), (1910) S.C. 519; 5. T.C. 529 (a rubber company part only of whose estate was producing rubber was allowed the cost of weeding, watching, manuring and clearing immature areas); Whelan (Inspector of Taxes) v. Dover Harbour Board (1934), 151 L.T, 288, C.A.; 18 T.C. 555, cited in note (1), p. 227, post; Cooke (Inspector of Taxes) v. Quick Shoe Repair Service (1949), 30 T.C. 460 (purchaser of business paid, by sale agreement, vendor's business debts to preserve goodwill and continuity of supplies; allowed as deductions)\nand this principle has been extended to include expenditure to avoid future expense which does not bring into being a tangible asset (b)\n(b) Mitchell v. B. Noble, Ltd., (1927) 1. K.B. 719, C.A.; 11 T.C. 372 (payment to get rid of a director); Hancock v. General Reversionary and Investment Co., Ltd., (1919) 1 K.B. 25; 7 T.C. 358 (an annuity purchased to get rid of an annual payment to a retired servant); Anglo-Persian Oil Co., Ltd. v. Dale, (1932) 1 K.B. 124, C.A.: 16 T. C. 253 (payment to cancel an agency agreement); Scammell and Nephew, Ltd. v. Rowles, (1939) 1 All E.R. 337, C.A.; 22 T.C. 479 (payments to compromise action procuring termination of disadvantageous trading relations) ; Inland Revenue Commissioners v. Patrick Thomson, Ltd. (1956), L. (T.C.) 1813 (change in control of company; compensation to managing director for cancellation of service agreement; right of company to treat compensation as trade expense not affected by subsequent liquidation of company and carrying on of company's trade by the other company which had secured control of the company which went into liquidation); but see Alexander Howard & Co., Ltd. v. Bentley (1948), 30 T.C. 334 (lump sum paid by a company for the surrender of a right to an annuity to widow of previous owner of company's business; not deducted).\nIt is of interest that all of the decisions referred to in footnotes (a) and (b) above were decided after Strong v. Woodifield.\nThe Privy Council decision in Income Tax Commissioner v. Singh[22], referred to on p. 168 of Halsbury, in which the appellant relied on Strong v. Woodifield, supra, shows how far the English courts have moved since Strong v. Woodifield was decided in 1906. The editorial note on p. 363 of the report points this out as follows:\nIt is clear that in the conduct of any business the bringing of proceedings to enforce the payment of sums due to the owner of the business must from time to time form part of the transactions necessary to the proper carrying on of the business. The expenses of bringing these actions are recognised as a proper deduction against profits. The present case takes the matter a considerable step further. Here an action, which the court in the exercise of considerable judicial restraint has characterised as unfounded, was brought against the taxpayer. The action in fact was based on matters which the plaintiffs found it quite impossible to prove, and it seems that the plaint itself covered some 80 pages of print, and was said to be quite unintelligible. The defence of such an action, which must be a serious charge upon the profits of the business, is held to be undertaken as part of the transactions of the business and the costs incurred in such defence are held to be a proper deduction against profits. The material provisions of the Indian Act in this connection are the same as those of the English Act, and the decision can be cited in relation to the latter Act to the same extent as any other decision of the Privy Council may\u2014that is, though not absolutely binding, it is to be treated with the greatest respect.\nThe references to advertising in some of the cases are most apt. The millions now spent by commercial companies on advertising in any given taxation year which admittedly is aimed at securing business in succeeding years could not, on an acceptance of the so-called rule in Strong v. Woodifield, be allowed. But such expenses are allowed without question and it is only common sense that they should be allowed. While it may be possible to isolate the receipts and expenditures of a salaried individual for a one taxation year period, it is impossible to do so with commercial or corporate enterprises whose business activities are continuous and where expenditures made in one taxation year may have no effect nor be intended to have any effect in producing the income of that year but are expected to produce income from the business operation of the taxpayer in subsequent taxation years within the meaning of s. 12(1) (a) of the Income Tax Act.\nA passage from the reasons for judgment of Abbott J. in B.C. Electric Railway Co. Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue at p. 137 has been quoted by my brother Ritchie. I think the important fact to note is that in B.C. Electric Railway Co. Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue, Abbott J. went on to find that the expenditure then in question was a capital outlay within the terms of s. 12(1) (b), (p.138), of the Income Tax Act. As such it was not deductible as an income expense in any event. The B.C. Electric Railway Co. Ltd. decision does not in consequence deal with the type of expenditure in issue here. To limit the expenditure, if it is to qualify as a deductible, to the income of the particular year in which it was made requires writing into s. 12(1) (a) of the Income Tax Act words which Parliament did not put there. The only qualification which Parliament imposed was that the outlay or expense be \"made or incurred by the tax-payer for the purpose of gaining or producing income from the property or business of the taxpayer\". No limitation as to time can be found in the section in question.\nTwo other Canadian decisions are very much in point. They are Minister of National Revenue v. Goldsmith Bros. and Minister of National Revenue v. L.D. Caulk Co. (tried together)[23] and Rolland Paper Co. v. Minister of National Revenue[24]. In the Goldsmith and Caulk cases, Rand J. said:\nThe question here is whether expenses incurred by the respondent company in defending itself against charges of violating the criminal law by combining with others to prevent or lessen unduly competition in the commercial distribution of dental supplies, are deductible in ascertaining taxable income. The agreement or arrangement alleged to have been unlawful purported to regulate day to day practices in the conduct of the respondent's business. It formed no part of the permanent establishment of the business; it was a scheme to govern operations rather than to create a capital asset; and the payment to defend the usages under it was a beneficial outlay to preserve what helped to produce the income. These expenses included legal fees both for appearing before the Commissioner under the Combines Investigation Act and at the trial which resulted in acquittal.\nThe provisions of the Income Tax Act are imposed on the settled practices of commercial accounting, but they create in effect a statutory mode of determining taxable income. Deductions from revenue must have been \"wholly, exclusively and necessarily laid out or expended for the purpose of earning the income\". Each word of this requirement is significant, and decisions based on different statutory language are strictly of limited assistance.\nThe payment arose from what were considered the necessity of the practices to the earning of the income. The case is then governed by The Minister v. Kellogg, (1943) S.C.R. 58. Proceedings there had been brought against the company to restrain it from using certain ordinary descriptive words in connection with the sale of its products and the expenses had been incurred in successfully resisting them. That use was likewise part of the day to day usage in marketing the company's products and the expenses were held to be deductible.\nThe word \"necessarily\" was urged by Mr. Varcoe as being unsatisfied by the facts. This term is not found in the English Act and it cannot be taken in a literal or absolute sense. Fire insurance, for instance, is admittedly a deductible expense, and yet how can it be said to be necessary when thousands of business houses have gone through generations of trade without loss from fire? The word must be taken as it was in Kellogg in the commercial sense of necessity.\nThe judgment of this Court in The Minister v. Dominion Natural Gas, (1941) S.C.R. 19, is clearly distinguishable as having been a case of expenses to preserve a capital asset in a capital aspect. In the Rolland Paper case the deduction challenged was for legal fees of $5,948.27 paid in the taxation year 1955 as its share of the legal costs of an appeal against the judgment of the Supreme Court of Ontario finding Rolland Paper Company and others guilty of illegal trade practices contrary to s. 498(1)(d) of the Criminal Code. The case resembled Goldsmith and Caulk but differed in that where the Goldsmith Company and the Caulk Company had been acquitted Rolland Paper Company was convicted. Fournier J. followed the Goldsmith and Caulk decision, holding that the fact of conviction was not material. He allowed the deduction. Notice of Appeal to this Court was given by the Minister. The appeal was not proceeded with, Notice of Discontinuance having been filed.\nFinally, this Court dealt with s. 12(1) (a) of the Income Tax Act in Evans v. The Minister of National Revenue[25]. The facts of that case are stated in the headnote as follows:\nExercising a power of appointment conferred upon him by the will of his father, the appellant's first husband bequeathed her the income for life of a one-third share of the father's estate. The trustee of the father's estate applied to the Court for advice and direction as to whether she was entitled to the income. In 1955, the matter was finally decided by this Court in favour of the appellant who had been represented by counsel in all the proceedings. In computing her income tax return for 1955, she deducted the legal fees she had paid her solicitors. The deduction was disallowed by the Minister. The Income Tax Appeal Board allowed the deduction, but the Minister's assessment was affirmed by the Exchequer Court of Canada.\nCartwright J., speaking for the majority, said at p. 395 et seq.:\nAs I read the whole of his reasons, the learned judge was of opinion that if the decisions of the courts in England were applicable he would have decided the question in favour of the tax-payer but felt himself bound by the decision of this Court in Dominion Natural Gas Ltd. v. M.N.R. (1941) S.C.R. 19, (1940) 4 D.L.R. 657 to reach a contrary conclusion. That case was decided under s. 6(1) of the Income War Tax Act, quoted above. In giving the judgment of the majority of this Court in B.C. Electric Ry. Co. v. M.N.R. (1958) S.C.R. 133 at 136, 12 D.L.R. (2d) 369, 77 C.R.T. c. 29, my brother Abbott said:\n\"The less stringent provisions of the new section should, I think, be borne in mind in considering judicial opinions based upon the former sections.\"\nWhether, in view of the later decisions of this Court in M.N.R. v. The Kellogg Company of Canada Ltd. (1943) S.C.R. 58, 2 D.L.R. 62 and M.N.R. v. Goldsmith Bros. Smelting and Refining Co. Ltd. (1954) S.C.R. 55, 2. D.L.R. 1, the Dominion Natural Gas case would be decided in the same manner if it arose to-day under the present section is a question which I do not have to consider. It is distinguishable from the case at bar.\n***\nThe \"asset\" or \"advantage\" under consideration in Dominion Natural Gas was a valuable, exclusive perpetual franchise; this franchise did not of itself yield any income to the Company which held it; it was a permanent right used and useful in the earning of the company's income by the sale of its product to the persons residing in the territory covered by the franchise; it was rightly regarded as an item of fixed capital.\n***\nIf the circumstances of the case at bar are viewed in the light most favourable to the respondent it can be said that the legal expenses were incurred not only to collect the income to which the appellant was entitled and which was being wrongly withheld from her but also to prevent the right to receive that income being destroyed; the right in question remains throughout a right to income. In the Dominion Natural Gas case, on the other hand, the expenses were incurred in litigation the subject matter of which was an item of fixed capital.\nIn my opinion, in the circumstances of this case there are two relevant questions both of which must, on the admitted facts, be answered in the affirmative; (i) was the appellant's claim in regard to which the expenses were incurred a claim to income to which she was entitled? (ii) were the legal expenses properly incurred in order to obtain payment of that income? It does not appear to me to be either necessary or relevant to inquire further as to what were the grounds (held by the Court to be without substance) upon which the payment of the income was withheld. It would be a strange result if the question, whether legal expenses incurred in enforcing or preserving a right should be regarded as an outlay on account of capital or on account of income, fell to be determined on a consideration not of the true nature of that right but of the nature of the ill-founded grounds on which it was disputed.\nFor the above reasons it is my opinion that the outlay of the legal expenses in question was not a payment on account of capital falling within s. 12 (1)(b) but was an expense, falling within s. 12(1)(a), incurred by the appellant for the purpose of gaining income from property, to which income she was at all relevant times entitled but of which she was unable to obtain payment without incurring these expenses.\nThese observations are equally applicable to the expenditures made by the appellant in the instant case.\nIn conclusion, as I see it, the expenditures here were ones which under sound accounting and commercial practice would be deducted in the Statement of Profit and Loss as expenditures for the year in determining the profit, if any, of the company for that year. Cattanach J. appears to have placed too much reliance on Lord Simond's words in Smith's Potato Estates case: \"What profit he has earned, he has earned before ever the voice of the taxgatherer is heard.\" I think it proper to observe that in each of the years in question before ever the voice of the taxgatherer was heard the expenditures in question had to be made to preserve the income and the working capital from the unwarranted claim of a foreign taxing authority otherwise the Canadian taxgatherer would have called in vain. He would have found an empty treasury and a commercial operation condemned to pay the United States. Internal Revenue Service tribute by way of income tax in future years.\nI would accordingly allow the appeal in toto with costs throughout payable by the respondent.\nSPENCE J.:\u2014I am in agreement with my brother Ritchie as to the appeal on the first judgment and would allow the appeal to permit the deduction of $46,532.56 and $45,192.03 described as \"commissions paid pursuant to agreement of December 29, 1944, with Transcontinental Resources Limited\".\nHowever, I must differ with Ritchie J. as to his disposition of the appeal from the second judgment as to the deduction of $20,831.51 being the total amount paid in the years 1951 and 1952 as legal expenses incurred in respect of a disputed claim for income tax asserted by the United States Inland Revenue Services. With regard to this latter appeal, I am in agreement with the reasons of my brother Martland and would allow the appeal and permit the deduction.\nIn the result, I would allow the appeal in toto with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs, ABBOTT and RITCHIE JJ. dissenting in part.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Mungovan & Mungovan, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the respondent : E.

(Defendant) Respondent.\n1966: May 20, 24; 1966: June 28.\nPresent: Fauteux, Judson, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nCompanies\u2014Agreement to purchase all outstanding shareholders' loans and shares in capital of company\u2014Mortgage of company to secure unpaid purchase price\u2014Whether mortgage given without consideration and in contravention of s. 152(1) of the Companies Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 67.\nAt the time the respondent company was incorporated by the appellants in connection with the purchase of a certain hotel property, only 20 shares of common stock were issued, 10 of which were allotted to each of the appellants for the price of $1 each and the real capital of the company with which the property was purchased was supplied by the appellants in the form of a shareholders' loan of $195,000. The appellants later entered into a formal agreement for the sale of the company to two individuals.\nThe agreement of sale provided that the purchasers would purchase all of the outstanding shareholders' loans ($142,369.55) and shares in the capital of the company for $225,500, $65,000 of which was to be paid in cash out of which the appellants agreed to forthwith retire an existing mortgage debt of the company of $59,461.42. The appellants also undertook to pay off a bank loan to the company of $12,500 and to deliver all the issued shares (i.e. 20 shares) to the purchasers at the time of closing on the condition, which did not appear to have been fulfilled, that they were to be held in escrow as part of the security for the unpaid balance owing under the agreement which was to bear interest at the rate of 7 per cent and was to be paid by monthly instalments of $1,429.30. It was further agreed that the $160,000 remaining unpaid should be secured by a mortgage on the whole assets and undertaking of the company.\nThe mortgage became in arrears and foreclosure proceedings were commenced resulting in an order nisi being granted. On appeal, the Court of Appeal set aside the decision of the trial judge and allowed the respondent's counterclaim for a declaration that the mortgage was void and unenforceable on the ground that it was given without consideration and in contravention of s. 152 of the Companies Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 67.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the judgment at trial restored.\nThe Court found that the agreement of sale must be interpreted as meaning that the shareholders' loans were not to be assigned until the company's indebtedness to the appellants had been properly protected by the giving of the mortgage for which the above recited obligations were more than adequate consideration. It was true that the company was not a party to the agreement, but once the purchasers had become the sole shareholders and directors, it was quite competent for them to consolidate the company's obligations into one item of indebtedness payable in monthly sums and secured by a mortgage in accordance with the agreement arrived at between the vendors and the purchasers.\nThe Court of Appeal had treated the circumstances of this case as being governed by the Thibault case (1962), 33 D.L.R. (2d) 317, affirmed [1963] S.C.R. 312, and accordingly held that the transaction was in contravention of s. 152(1) of the Companies Act, supra, which reads: \"A company shall not give, whether directly or indirectly, and whether by means of a loan, guarantee, the provision of security or otherwise, any financial assistance for the purpose of or in connection with a purchase made or to be made by any person of any shares in the company;\u2026\" This Court was of the opinion that the Thibault case was distinguishable from the circumstances here disclosed and held that the present case was not governed by that authority.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] , allowing an appeal from a judgment of Branca J. Appeal allowed and judgment at trial restored.\nHumphry Waldock, for the plaintiffs, appellants.\nj. Giles and P. Jensen, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[2]allowing an appeal from the judgment rendered at trial by Branca J. and thereby dismissing the claim of the present appellants for foreclosure of a mortgage given by the respondent for the stated consideration of $160,000 covering a hotel property situate at Lac La Hache on the Cariboo Highway. By this judgment the Court of Appeal also allowed the respondent's counterclaim for a declaration that the mortgage was void and unenforceable on the ground that it was given without consideration and in contravention of s. 152 of the Companies Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 67.\nThe transaction which is here in question can only be properly understood in light of the following circumstances which gave rise to it.\nWhen the respondent company was incorporated by the appellants in February 1961 in connection with the purchase of the hotel property in question, only 20 shares of common stock were issued, 10 of which were alloted to each of the appellants for the price of $1 each and the real capital of the company with which the property was purchased was supplied by the appellants in the form of a shareholders' loan of $195,000.\nIn the autumn of 1963, Louis C. Buendia and Cyrias W. Prevost of Kamloops, (hereinafter called the purchasers) became interested in acquiring the company and on the 31st of December of that year the appellants entered into a formal agreement with them for its sale. It is the construction to be placed on the terms of this agreement which has given rise to the difference of opinion in the Courts below.\nThe financial statement of the company as at December 15, 1963, disclosed its liabilities and capital to be as follows:\nLIABILITIES AND CAPITAL\nCURRENT LIABILITIES\nAccounts payable\n$ 6,042.33\nBank overdraft\n94.01\n$ 6,136.34\nMORTGAGE\nPrincipal\n58,388.76\nAccrued interest\n1,072.66\n59,461.42\nLOAN\nShareholders\n142,369.55\nBank\n12,500.00\n154,869.55\nCAPITAL\nAuthorized\u201410,000 shares par value $1.00\nEach\n10,000.00\nIssued\u201420 shares par value $1.00 each\n20.00 $220,487.31\nThe agreement of sale provided that the purchasers would purchase all of the outstanding shareholders' loans and shares in the capital of the company for $225,000, $65,000 of which was to be paid in cash out of which the appellants agreed to forthwith retire the existing mortgage debt of $59,461.42. The appellants also undertook to pay off the bank loan and to deliver all the issued shares in the company (i.e. 20 shares) to the purchasers at the time of closing on the condition, which does not appear to have been fulfilled, that they were to be held in escrow as part of the security for the unpaid balance owing under the agree- ment which was to bear interest at the rate of 7 per cent and was to be paid by monthly instalments of $1,429.30. It was further agreed that the $160,000 remaining unpaid should be secured by a mortgage on the whole assets and undertaking of the company and as it is this provision in the agreement which has given rise to much of the difficulty, I think it desirable to set it out in full as follows:\n(c) The said balance of One Hundred Sixty Thousand ($160,000.00) Dollars shall be secured by the Purchasers upon the whole assets and undertaking of the Company by way of mortgage of the said assets and undertaking in favour of the Vendors together with an escrow of all outstanding shares of the Company. Such mortgage and escrow agreement to be in the usual form and approved by the Vendors. The time and the manner of the assignment of shareholders loons to the Purchasers shall be as agreed upon by negotiation with a view to mutual protection of all parties. And said mortgage shall include an acceleration clause upon a default not remedied within ninety (90) days of notice of default.\nThe italics are my own.\nIt appears to me to be important to observe that the shareholders' loans were not assigned automatically as a result of the agreement and in fact were not required to be assigned until they had been properly protected by the taking of the mortgage which was given by the company as security for its indebtedness to the appellants.\nAs has been pointed out by the learned trial judge, the company was enriched to the total amount of $71,961.42 by the appellants assuming the outstanding mortgage and the bank loan and in the absence of clear and unambiguous language compelling me to do so, I am unable to interpret the agreement as meaning that the parties intended that the appellants were to assume these obligations and also to assign their shareholders' loans in the amount of $142,-369.55 without first being properly protected by some form of security. I am therefore, with the greatest respect for the view adopted by the members of the Court of Appeal, of the opinion that the agreement must be interpreted as meaning that the shareholders' loans were not to be assigned until the company's indebtedness to the appellants had been properly protected by the giving of the mortgage for which the above recited obligations were more than adequate consideration. It is true that the company was not a party to the agreement of December 31, but once the purchasers had become the sole shareholders and directors, it was quite competent for them to consolidate the company's obligations into one item of indebtedness payable in monthly sums and secured by a mortgage in accordance with the agreement arrived at between the vendors and the purchasers.\nThe Court of Appeal has suggested that this interpretation of the agreement results in the company having assumed an obligation of $160,000 to the vendors while remaining liable to the purchasers as assignees of the shareholders' loans in the amount of $142,369.55. I do not so interpret the situation. It appears to me that the substance and effect of the agreement of December 31 was that only as the purchasers paid off the mortgage of $160,000 they would become, to the extent of the payment, subrogated to the position of the vendors.\nThe Court of Appeal, however, treated the circumstances as being governed by the case of Trustee of Estate of Thibault Auto Ltd. v. Thibault[3] , (hereinafter referred to as the \"Thibault case\") which was affirmed in this Court[4] , and accordingly held that the transaction was in contravention of s. 152 (1) of the Companies Act which reads as follows:\nA company shall not give, whether directly or indirectly, and whether by means of a loan, guarantee, the provision of security or otherwise, any financial assistance for the purpose of or in connection with a purchase made or to be made by any person of any shares in the company;\u2026\nThe Thibault case was not one in which the vendors as mortgagees were seeking to foreclose a mortgage given by way of additional security in the manner disclosed in the present case. In the Thibault case the action was brought by the trustee in bankruptcy of the Thibault Company which had itself been incorporated for the express purpose of facilitating the sale of Mr. Thibault's personal assets to one Clavette. The circumstances were that Thibault, who operated an automobile business in Edmunston, decided to cell it to Clavette for $60,000, but finding that the purchaser did not have the funds available, he consulted his accountant and his lawyer and finally arranged to transfer the assets to a company which he incorporated for the purpose and then to sell the shares in that company to Clavette for $90,000 on the understanding that Clavette would arrange to have the purchase price secured by giving him a mortgage of the company's assets for the full amount of $90,000 which was to be paid in instalments over a period of 15 years. It appears that Thibault was encouraged in making these arrangements by the advice that in conveying his business assets to the company an advantage would accrue to him through avoiding a charge back to income of any recapture of capital cost allowance previously claimed as a deduction for income tax purposes. In any event, the transaction from beginning to end was predicated upon the understanding that the company would issue a mortgage for the full amount of the purchase price for the sole and express purpose of providing security for the purchase of the shares by Clavette. What the Thibault case decided was that such a transaction could be set aside at the suit of the company's creditors on the ground that it was a flagrant breach of s. 37(1) of the Companies Act, R.S.N.B. 1952, c. 33, which in all relevant essentials was the same as s. 152(1) of the British Columbia Companies Act.\nIn the Thibault case there was no question of a down payment having been made or any other consideration having been given for the shares except the undertaking to pay the amount secured by the mortgage, nor was there any assignment of shareholders' loans or assumption of company obligations by the vendors. For these reasons and for those given by Mr. Justice Branca, I am satisfied that the Thibault case is distinguishable from the circumstances here disclosed and with the greatest respect for the views expressed by the Court of Appeal of British Columbia, I do not think that this case is governed by that authority.\nFor these reasons, as well as for those set out in the reasons for judgment of Branca J., I would allow the appeal and restore the judgment at trial. The appellants will have their costs in this Court and in the Court of Appeal.\nAppeal allowed and judgment at trial restored.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, appellants: Oliver, Miller & Co., Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Farris, Farris, Vaughan, Taggart, Wills & Murphy, Vancouver.\n[1] (1966), 55 W.W.R. 385.\n[2] (1966), 55 W.W.R. 385.\n[3] (1962), 33 D.L.R.

Three separate tenders submitted by the respondent for the original work were made and accepted on the basis that the roofing, roof insulation and sheet metal work was to be done pursuant to descriptions and specifications which the appellant had forwarded to the respondent together with its invitation to tender. These descriptions and specifications were prepared by employees of the appellant company and contained complete details as to the materials and methods of construction to be employed which included the requirement that the insulating boards were to be attached to the steel sheeting on the roofs by the use of \u201cCuradex or approved equal\u201d. The damage was caused by the failure of the Curadex adhesive to perform the function for which it was intended.\nThe specifications had also required the contractor to furnish a five-year guarantee that all the work specified would remain weather tight and that all material and workmanship employed would be first class and without defect.\nThe appellant resisted the respondent\u2019s claims on the ground that the repair work for which it claimed compensation was work which it was required to do under the terms of its guarantee, whereas the respondent contended that the guarantee did not require it to repair damage occasioned by the failure of material, which had been selected and specified by the appellant, to perform the function for which it was intended. At trial judgment was rendered in favour of the respondent and on appeal the trial judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nThe Court was unable to accept the contention put forward on behalf of the respondent that \u201c\u2014under the circumstances the plaintiff guaranteed only that, as to the work done by it, the roof would be weather tight in so far as the plans and specifications with which it had to comply would allow\u201d. The word \u201cwork\u201d as used in the guarantee was interpreted as referring to the completed work including the materials of which it was required to be composed and this construction was entirely consistent with the further guarantee required by the specifications that \u201call material and workmanship employed are first class and without defect\u201d. Curadex was a material selected by the appellant but it was one of the materials which the respondent agreed to employ in the work and which it thereby agreed to guarantee as \u201cfirst class and without defect\u201d. The latter words were construed as meaning \u201cfirst class and without defect\u201d for the purpose of its intended use.\nWhen a contractor expressly undertakes to carry out work which will perform a certain function in conformity with plans and specifications, and it turns out that the work so constructed will not perform the function, \u201cgenerally the express obligation to construct a work capable of carrying out the duty in question overrides the obligation to comply with the plans and specifications, and the contractor will be liable for the failure of the work notwithstanding that it is carried out in accordance with the plans and specification. Nor will he be entitled to extra payment for amending the work so that it will perform the stipulated duty.\u201d\nThe agreement to furnish a written guarantee \u201cthat all work above specified will remain weather tight\u201d for five years constituted at the very least an express undertaking to carry out work which would perform a certain function in conformity with plans and specifications and in accordance with the above-quoted principles, established by a long line of decisions, it followed that when a work so constructed does not perform the function which the contractor agreed that it would perform, the contractor is liable for the failure of the work and is not entitled to extra payment for repairing it so that it will perform the stipulated duty.

Dryden, for the defendant, appellant.\nJohn J. Robinette, Q.C., and W. Schreiber, Q.C., for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014On the opening of this appeal an application was granted to change the name of the plaintiff-respondent from Schreiber Roofing Company (Ontario) Limited to Willand Management Limited in conformity with supple- mentary Letters Patent issued by the Provincial Secretary of Ontario on January 23, 1944.\nThis is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[2] affirming the judgment rendered at trial before Mr. Justice Hughes which allowed the claim of the respondent for compensation for work and services performed by it in repairing windstorm damage to three roofs which it had constructed on buildings owned by the appellant in the City of Hamilton.\nIn the spring of 1957 the appellant accepted three separate tenders submitted by the respondent for the \u201capplication of built-up roofing\u201d on the sloping roofs of two of its new buildings. It is not disputed that these tenders were made and accepted on the basis that the roofing, roof insulation and sheet metal work was to be done pursuant to the \u201cDescriptions and Specifications\u201d which the appellant had forwarded to the respondent together with its invitation to tender. These \u201cDescriptions and Specifications\u201d were prepared by employees of the appellant company and contained complete details as to the materials and method of construction to be employed which included the requirement that insulating boards were to be attached to the steel sheeting on these roofs by the use of \u201cCuradex or approved equal\u201d.\nCuradex is an expensive fire resistant adhesive prepared by Currie Products Limited which had been used by the respondent on more than one occasion in constructing flat roofs for buildings of the appellant but which had not been previously used by either party in constructing sloping roofs.\nThe three separate windstorms which damaged the appellant\u2019s roofs were of a kind which was reasonably foreseeable in the Hamilton area and each of them had the effect of severing the insulating boards from the steel sheeting of the roofs constructed by the respondent. It was not disputed that at the time of these storms these roofs were not \u201cweather tight\u201d within the meaning of the guarantees which are hereinafter referred to and there are concurrent findings in the Courts below to the effect that the damage was caused by the failure of the Curadex adhesive to per- form the function for which it was intended. The findings in this regard are summarized by Gale J.A. in the course of the reasons for judgment which he rendered on behalf of the Court of Appeal in the following passage:\nIt was found by the learned trial judge that the cause of the damage was the failure of the adhesive (Curadex) to hold the roofing to the steel deck. He also found that the materials used by the plaintiff were those which the specifications required it to use; that there was no defect in the workmanship and that the materials were applied in the quantities and manner required by the specifications.\nIt accordingly appears to me that the question which lies at the heart of this appeal is whether the responsibility for the results of using Curadex rests upon the appellant who prescribed it or upon the respondent who applied it, and in this regard it seems to me to be of first importance to consider the circumstances under which this adhesive came to be included in the specifications.\nIn the course of preparing the specifications, Mr. L. Tweedie, who was in charge of the project for the appellant company, sought the advice of Mr. H.L. Schreiber, general manager of the respondent, who was a highly qualified expert on built-up roofing, as to the best method to be employed in the construction of the roofs in question. Mr. Schreiber spoke with great authority and in view of the experience he and his company had had in the use of Curadex as an adhesive on flat roofs, he must, in my view, be taken to have had knowledge of the properties and potential of this product as a wind resistant adhesive. In the course of his lengthy discussions with Mr. Tweedie and other members of the appellant company, Mr. Schreiber expressed a preference for the use of hot, stiff asphalt rather than Curadex for the sloping roofs which the appellant had in contemplation but having consulted with his associates in Detroit he made three separate tenders on behalf of his company pursuant to specifications which, as has been stated, required the use of \u201cCuradex or approved equal\u201d.\nThe attitude of the respondent in this regard as expressed by Mr. Schreiber is best summarized in a passage from his cross-examination where he said:\nA. Let\u2019s put it this way: I preferred the use of asphalt, but if a customer saw fit to use Cur-Adex, I would go along, certainly, with whatever he saw fit. Q. You went along with this, and made your tender on these specifications? A. Yes, sir. This is what the Steel Company wanted me to tender on.\nThe invitation to tender in respect of each roof included the following paragraph:\nIf you are interested in this work please contact our Mr. Tweedie, visit the site; obtain drawings and submit your quotation in duplicate to this office.\nIt therefore appears to me that when he signed the tenders on behalf of the respondent, although he had had no actual experience in the use of Curadex on sloping roofs, Mr. Schreiber was, as the result of lengthy discussions with the appellant\u2019s officers and of his having previously used the product on flat roofs, fully aware of the factors necessary to enable him to decide whether or not this adhesive was a first-class material for its intended use, and whether it was one which his company was prepared to guarantee to remain \u201cweather tight\u201d for a period of five years.\nThe respondent\u2019s officials had the first specifications in their hands for three weeks before deciding to tender and it is to be presumed that during that period consideration was given to the terms of the paragraph of those specifications under the heading \u201cBond and Guarantee\u201d which read as follows:\nThis Contractor is to furnish a written guarantee running for a period of five years, that all work above specified will remain weather tight and that all material and workmanship employed are first class and without defect. Terms of all guarantees shall begin at completion of the work. This contractor shall make good without charge all defects appearing within period named when requested in writing by the Owner.\nThe three guarantees which were eventually given sometime after the repairs had been completed, are made effective for five years from the date when the original work was finished and they therefore must, in my view, have reference to the roofs as they existed at that date and can have no relation to the very different structures which were produced as a result of the repairs.\nIn this regard, I disagree with Hughes J. when he says of the completely repaired roofs:\n...it was these roofs which were referred to in the written guarantees which it (i.e. the respondent) eventually supplied in March 1958. The appellant resisted the respondent\u2019s claim on the ground that the repair work for which it claims compensation was work which it was required to do under the terms of its guarantee, whereas the respondent contended that the guarantee did not require it to repair damage occasioned by the failure of material, which had been selected and specified by the appellant, to perform the functions for which it was intended.\nI agree with Gale J.A. that \u201cthis case is to be decided simply by a common sense interpretation of that part of the guarantee which is under dispute\u201d but unlike him I am, with all respect, unable to accept the contention put forward on behalf of the respondent that:\n...under the circumstances the plaintiff guaranteed only that, as to the work done by it, the roof would be weather-tight in so jar as the plans and specifications with which it had to comply would allow.\nThe italics are my own.\nIn accepting this contention, the Court of Appeal followed the reasoning employed by the New York State Court of Appeal in the case of MacKnight Flintic Stone Co. v. The Mayor, Aldermen and Commonalty of the City of New York[3] in which that Court was construing a contractor\u2019s guarantee which provided that the work done by the contractor was to be turned over to the City in perfect order and \u201cguaranteed absolutely weather and damp proof for five years from the date of acceptance of the work. Any dampness or water breakage within that time must be made good by the contractor without any cost or expense to the City.\u201d\nGale J.A. found the issues in that case to be substantially the same as those in the present case and he adopted the following paragraph from the reasons for judgment of Vann J. who delivered the judgment for the New York Court:\nThe reasonable construction of the covenant under consideration is that the plaintiff should furnish the materials and do the work according to the plan and specifications, and thus make the floors water tight so far as the plan and specifications would permit.\nThe italics are my own.\nIt will be observed that the acceptance of the interpretation placed by the Court of Appeal upon the guarantee required by the specifications involves supplying the words \u201cin so far as the plans and specifications with which it had to comply would allow\u201d which are not contained in the guarantee itself. The five-year guarantee which was required to be given by all those tendering on the works in question included the stipulation \u201cthat all work above specified will remain weather tight...\u201d and in my view the words \u201call work above specified\u201d mean the work described in the specification which included the employment of Curadex as the adhesive material to be used in attaching the insulating boards to the steel sheeting on the roofs in question. If any other adhesive material had been used by the contractor the completed work would not have been the \u201cwork above specified\u201d which the respondent was required to guarantee.\nI interpret the word \u201cwork\u201d as it is used in the five-year guarantee as referring to the completed work including the materials of which it was required to be composed and this construction in my view appears to be entirely consistent with the further guarantee required by the specifications that \u201call material and workmanship employed are first class and without defect\u201d. It is true that Curadex was a material selected by the appellant but it was one of the materials which the respondent agreed to employ in the work and which it thereby agreed to guarantee as \u201cfirst class and without defect\u201d. I think these latter words must be construed as meaning \u201cfirst class and without defect\u201d for the purpose of its intended use.\nIn construing the guarantee as he did, Gale J.A. was clearly influenced by the fact that he did not think that it would have been reasonable for the defendant to have expected, and the plaintiff to have given, an absolute guarantee against the elements when neither had had any experience with the capacity of Curadex to perform properly on the sloping steel deck.\nIn this regard it is, however, to be remembered that the respondent is an experienced contractor specializing in the roofing business and that it was bidding in competition with several other roofing contractors. Under these circumstances the language employed by Cockburn C.J. in Stadhard v. Lee[4] which was quoted with approval in the Exchequer Court of Canada in Jones v. The Queen[5] appears to me to be particularly pertinent:\nIt frequently happens, in the competition which notoriously exists in the various departments of business, that persons anxious to obtain contracts submit to terms which, when they come to be enforced, appear harsh and oppressive. From the stringency of such terms escape is often sought by endeavouring to read the agreement otherwise than according to its plain meaning. But the duty of a court in such cases is to ascertain and to give effect to the intention of the parties as evidenced by the agreement, and though, where the language of the contract admit of it, it should be presumed that the parties meant only to be reasonable, yet, if the terms are clear and unambiguous the court is bound to give effect to them without stopping to consider how far they may be reasonable or not.\nIn construing the guarantee by supplying the words \u201cin so far as the plans and specifications with which it had to comply would allow\u201d it appears to me that the Courts below have tacitly accepted the proposition that no matter how experienced a contractor may be in a particular field, he nevertheless bears no responsibility for the employment of defective material in the work which he has undertaken, provided that it is a material which has been selected by the owner and included in the specifications. This proposition finds support in the judgment of Vann J. in the MacKnight case, supra, in a passage which was expressly adopted by Hughes J. which reads as follows:\nThe defendant, (i.e. the owner), specifically selected both material and design and ran the risk of a bad result. If there was an implied warranty of sufficiency, it was made by the party who prepared the plan and specifications, because they were its work, and in calling for proposals to produce a specified result by following them, it may fairly be said to have warranted them adequate to produce that result.\nI cannot accept this proposition which appears to me to run contrary to a long line of decisions in England starting with Thorn v. The Mayor and Commonalty of London[6] which have been followed in this country (see Jones v. The Queen, supra, Sansan Floor Company v. Forst\u2019s Limited[7], Grace v. Osler[8]), and the effect of which is summarized in part in Hudson\u2019s Building and Engineering Contracts, 8th ed., 1959, at p. 147 where it is said:\nSometimes, again, a contractor will expressly undertake to carry out work which will perform a certain duty or function in conformity with plans and specifications, and it turns out that the work constructed in accordance with the plans and specifications will not perform that duty or function. It would appear that generally the express obligation to construct a work capable of carrying out the duty in question overrides the obligation to comply with the plans and specifications, and the contractor will be liable for the failure of the work notwithstanding that it is carried out in accordance with the plans and specification. Nor will he be entitled to extra payment for amending the work so that it will perform the stipulated duty.\nThe agreement to furnish a written guarantee \u201cthat all work above specified will remain weather tight\u201d for five years in my view constitutes at the very least an express undertaking \u201cto carry out work which well perform a certain...function in conformity with plans and specifications\u201d and in accordance with the principles stated in the paragraph last above cited, I think that it follows that when a work so constructed does not perform the function which the contractor agreed that it would perform, the contractor is liable for the failure of the work and is not entitled to extra payment for repairing it \u201cso that it will perform the stipulated duty\u201d.\nIn the course of his reasons for judgment, Mr. Justice Hughes expresses the following view:\nIt would seem\u2026that from this evidence that the defendant corporation was taking a calculated risk in specifying the adhesive designed and required to fasten the roofing membrane to a roof of new design and it would seem that they knew this to be the case.\nIn my opinion the evidence discloses that both parties were fully alerted to any limitations which may have attached to the use of Curadex as an adhesive on these roof decks and in view of the fact that neither of them had had any experience in using it on sloping roofs, I think that some risk was involved. This may have been the reason why the appellant required the contractors who were tendering on the work to provide the guarantee in question, but whatever the reason may have been, it appears to me that any risk involved in the undertaking was accepted by those who were prepared to tender in accordance with specifications which included the requirement of providing a written guarantee that all material employed in the work was first class and without defect, and that \u201call work\u2026specified\u201d would remain weather tight for a period of five years. In view of all the above I would allow this appeal and dismiss the action of the respondent with costs in this Court and in the Courts below.\nAppeal allowed and action dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Levinter, Grossberg, Dryden, Rachlin, Bliss & Raphael, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the plaintiff, respondent: William Schreiber, Hamilton.\n[1] Sub nom.

Act, 1867, es. 91(29), 92(10).\nPursuant to a by-law enacted by virtue of the powers conferred upon it by the Minimum Wage Act, R.S.Q. 1941, c. 164, the Minimum Wage Commission sought to impose a wage levy upon the defendant company, in respect of the year 1959. The defendant contended that it was not subject to the Minimum Wage Act. The trial judge main\u00adtained the action, but his judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeal. The Commission appealed to this Court. The Attorney General of Canada, the Attorney General of Quebec and the Attorney General for Ontario were granted leave to intervene.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe Minimum Wage Act, being a statute which, inter alia, purports to regulate to an extent the wages to be paid by an employer to his employees, does not apply to the defendant company because the defendant is an undertaking of the kind described in subs. 10(a) and (c) of s. 92 of the B.N.A. Act. The determination of such matters as hours of work, rates of wages, working conditions and the like, is a vital part of the management and operation of any commercial or industrial undertaking. Regulation of the field of employer and employees' relationships in an undertaking such as that of the defend-ant is a \"matter\" coming within the class of subjects defined in s. 92(10)(a) of the B.N.A. Act and, consequently, is within the exclusive legislative jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada. Therefore, any provincial legislation in that field, whilst valid in respect of employers not within exclusive federal legislative jurisdiction, cannot apply to employers who are within that exclusive control.\n*PRESENT: Taschereau C.J. and Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Hall JJ.\nDroit constitutionnel-Travail-Salaire minimum-Pr\u00e9l\u00e8vement d'un imp\u00f4t-Compagnie de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone op\u00e9rant un syst\u00e8me interprovincial de communications et de service-Compagnie est-elle sujette au statut provincial Loi du Salaire minimum, S.R.Q. 1941, c. 164-Loi sur les Relations industrielles et sur les enqu\u00eates visant les diff\u00e9rends du travail, S.R.C. 1952, c. 152-Code canadien du travail, 1964-65 (Can.), c. 38-Acte de l'Am\u00e9rique du Nord britannique, 1867 , arts. 91(29), 92(10).\nLa Commission du Salaire minimum a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 de la compagnie d\u00e9fen\u00adderesse une somme de quelque $50,000 \u00e0 titre de pr\u00e9l\u00e8vement pour l'ann\u00e9e 1959 aux termes de son r\u00e8glement pass\u00e9 en vertu des pouvoirs qui lui sont conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par la Loi du Salaire minimum, S.R.Q. 1941, c. 164.

Pollock, for the Attorney General for Ontario.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.:-This is an appeal from the unanimous decision of the Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal Side) of the Province of Quebec', which allowed the appeal of the present respondent from the judgment at trial and dismissed the appellant's action against the respondent.\nThe appellant's claim was for the sum of $53,473.64, being the amount of a levy which the appellant sought to. impose upon the respondent, in respect of the year 1959, pursuant to By-Law B1, 1947, enacted by the appellant by virtue of the powers conferred upon it by the Minimum Wage Act, R.S.Q. 1941, c. 164, being a sum of one-tenth of one per cent of the wages paid to its employees governed by an ordinance of the appellant. The statutory authority to impose such a levy is found in s. 8e of that Act, which enabled the appellant:\nTo levy upon the professional employers contemplated by an ordi\u00adnance a sum not exceeding one per cent of the wages paid to their employees. The appellant, prior to the enactment of the by-law above mentioned, had enacted Ordinance No. 4, 1957, applicable to all employees governed by the Minimum Wage Act, with certain specified exceptions. The respond\u00adent's employees were not within any of the excepted categories. It provided, inter alia, for minimum wage rates, hours of work, payment of overtime and holidays with pay.\nThe authority to enact the ordinance is contained in s. 13 of the Act, which provides that:\n13. The Commission may, by ordinance, determine, for stated periods of time and for designated territories, the rate of minimum wage payable to any category of employees indicated by it, the terms of payment, working hours, conditions of apprenticeship, the proportion between the number of skilled workmen and that of apprentices in any stated under-taking, the classification of the operations and the other working condi\u00adtions deemed in conformity with the spirit of the Act.\nThe respondent contends that it is not subject to the levy because the provisions of the ordinance and of the statute pursuant to which the ordinance was enacted cannot apply to it, since it is an undertaking of the kind described in subs. 10(a) and (c) of s. 92 of the British North America Act. That the respondent is an undertaking falling within the class defined in subs. 10(a) and that it has been de\u00adclared by the Parliament of Canada to be a work for the general advantage of Canada pursuant to subs. 10(c) is not in issue.\nThere is no question as to the amount involved or as to the respondent being subject to the levy if the defence which it has raised is not sustained. It is also conceded that the Minimum Wage Act is, generally, within the compe\u00adtence of the Legislature of Quebec. The only matter to be determined is whether it can apply to an undertaking which is within paras. (a), (b) or (c) of subs. 10 of s. 92 of the British North America Act.\nThree of the judges in the Court below (the Chief Justice and Rinfret and Owen JJ.) were of the opinion that the fixing of a minimum wage and the regulation of the other matters provided for in the Minimum Wage Act could, in relation to the employees of such an undertaking, be effected only by the Parliament of Canada. The other two mem\u00adbers of the Court (Hyde and Taschereau JJ.), while of the opinion that, in the absence of legislation by the federal parliament, the provincial legislation would be applicable, were of the opinion that the key section of the Act, s. 13, did, in fact, conflict with the provisions of the Industrial Relations and Disputes Investigation Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 152.\nThe appellant's submission is that the legislation in ques\u00adtion did apply to the respondent until the federal parlia\u00adment occupied the field and that this was not done until the enactment, on March 18, 1965, of the Canada Labour Standards Code, Statutes of Canada 1964-65, c. 38.\nThe relevant provisions of the British North America Act are as follows:\n91.... it is hereby declared that (notwithstanding anything in this Act) the exclusive Legislative Authority of the Parliament of Canada extends to all Matters coming within the Classes of Subjects next here\u00adinafter enumerated; that is to say,\u2011\n* * *\n29. Such Classes of Subjects as are expressly excepted in the Enu\u00admeration of the Classes of Subjects by this Act assigned exclusive\u00adly to the Legislatures of the Provinces.\n92. In each Province the Legislature may exclusively make Laws in relation to Matters coming within the Classes of Subjects next hereinafter enumerated; that is to say,\u2011\n* * *\n10. Local Works and Undertakings other than such as are of the following Classes:\u2011\n(a) Lines of Steam or other Ships, Railways, Canals, Telegraphs, and other Works and Undertakings connecting the Province with any other or others of the Provinces, or extending beyond the Limits of the Province:\n(b) Lines of Steam Ships between the Province and any British or Foreign Country:\n(c) Such Works as, although wholly situate within the Province, are before or after their Execution declared by the Parliament of Canada to be for the general Advantage of Canada or for the Advantage of Two or more of the Provinces.\nI have quoted these well known provisions of the Act in full because I think it is of assistance to refer back to their actual wording in defining the issue in the present case. The Minimum Wage Act is a statute which, inter alia, purports to regulate to an extent the wages to be paid by the re\u00adspondent to its employees. If the regulation of the wages paid to its employees by an undertaking within the excepted classes in s. 92(10) is a \"matter\" coming within those classes of subject, then, by virtue of s. 91(29), it is within the exclusive legislative authority of the Canadian Par\u00adliament. The question is, therefore, as to what \"matters\" are with-in the classes of legislative subjects defined in that paragraph. Clearly they extend beyond the mere physical struc\u00adture of, e.g., a railway or a telegraph system. The words \"works\" and \"undertakings\" are to be read disjunctively (Attorney-General for Ontario v. Winner[2]) and the word \"undertaking\" has been defined in re Regulation and Control of Radio Communication in Canada:[3]\n\"Undertaking\" is not a physical thing, but is an arrangement under which of course physical things are used.\nIn my opinion all matters which are a vital part of the operation of an interprovincial undertaking as a going con\u00adcern are matters which are subject to the exclusive legisla\u00adtive control of the federal parliament within s. 91(29). It was not disputed in argument that the regulation of the rates to be paid by the respondent's customers is a matter for federal legislation. In the Winner case, supra, the regu\u00adlation of those places at which passengers of an inter-provincial bus line might be picked up or to which they might be carried was held not to be subject to provincial control. Similarly, I feel that the regulation and control of the scale of wages to be paid by an interprovincial under-taking, such as that of the respondent, is a matter for exclusive federal control.\nI would adopt the statement of Abbott J. in this Court, in the Reference as to the Validity of the Industrial Rela\u00adtions and Disputes Investigation Acts[4]:\nThe right to strike and the right to bargain collectively are now generally recognized, and the determination of such matters as hours of work, rates of wages, working conditions and the like, is in my opinion a vital part of the management and operation of any commercial or industrial undertaking. This being so, the power to regulate such matters, in the case of undertakings which fall within the legislative authority of Parliament lies with Parliament and not with the Provincial Legislatures.\nIn my view, this conclusion does not run counter to decided authorities. They have been carefully reviewed in the judgments in the Court below. I do not propose to discuss them in detail, but will confine my remarks to the two authorities on which counsel for the appellant chiefly relied. The first of these is Workmen's Compensation Board v. Canadian Pacific Railway Company[5]. That action was brought by the railway company to prevent the British Columbia Workmen's Compensation Board from paying compensation to dependants of crew members employed on one of the company's steamships which was lost outside British territory. The notes of the argument do not indicate that counsel for the railway company relied at all upon the fact that it was an undertaking within s. 92(10) (b). The case was argued on the issue as to whether the Workmen's Compensation Act affected civil rights outside the province when it applied to accidents occurring outside the province.\nThe only passage in the judgment which refers to the position of the company as a railway company is the following, at p. 192:\nNo doubt for some purposes the law sought to be enforced affects the liberty to carry on its business of a Dominion railway company to which various provisions of s. 91 of the British North America Act of 1867 apply. But for other purposes, with which the Legislature of British Columbia had jurisdiction to deal under s. 92, it was competent to that Legislature to pass laws regulating the civil duties of a Dominion railway company which carried on business within the Province, and in the course of that business was engaging workmen whose civil rights under their contracts of employment had been placed by the Act of 1867 within the jurisdiction of the province.\nThere is no specific reference in this passage to s. 92(10), nor is it attempted to define the scope of those matters with respect to which the federal parliament has exclusive legislative jurisdiction under that subsection. The case did hold that the railway company was subject to the provisions of the Workmen's Compensation Act.\nIn my opinion there is a distinction between legislation of that kind, and that which is in issue here. The Work-men's Compensation Act conferred upon injured employees and upon the dependants of deceased employees certain statutory rights to compensation where the injury or death resulted from an accident arising out of and in the course of the employment. Compensation was payable not by the employer, but out of a fund administered by the Board to which employers were required to contribute. Viscount Haldane (p. 191) refers to the employee's right under the Act as the result of a \"statutory condition of employment\", but I think it is more accurately described as a statutory right. The Act did not purport to regulate the contract of employment. What it did do was to create certain new legal rights which were to be in lieu of all rights of action to which the employee or his dependants might otherwise have been entitled at common law or by statute.\nOn the other hand, a statute which deals with a matter which, apart from regulatory legislation, would have been the subject matter of contract between employer and em\u00adployee, e.g., rates of pay or hours of work, affects a vital part of the management and operation of the undertaking to which it relates. This being so, if such regulation relates to an undertaking which is within s. 92(10) (a), (b) or (c), in my opinion it can only be enacted by the federal parlia\u00adment.\nThe other authority on which counsel for the appellant particularly relied was the Reference as to the Legislative Jurisdiction over Hours of Labour[6]. That was a reference to this Court by the Governor General in Council, which was made as a result of the draft convention adopted by the International Labour Conference of the League of Nations limiting the hours of labour in industrial undertak\u00adings. An article in the Treaty of Versailles provided that each of the members of the Labour Conference undertook to bring the draft convention before the authorities compe\u00adtent to legislate. Canada was a member, and the reference was made to determine the appropriate legislative authorities.\nThe conclusion of this Court was that primarily the sub\u00adject matter of hours of work was generally within the competence of the provincial legislatures, but that the au\u00adthority of those legislatures did not extend to enable them to give the force of law to the provisions contained in the draft convention in relation to servants of the Dominion Government.\nIn the course of the reasons of this Court, delivered by Duff J. (as he then was), there was a brief reference, at p. 511, to ss. 91(29) and 92(10) of the British North America Act, in the following terms:\nIt is now settled that the Dominion, in virtue of its authority in respect of works and undertakings falling within its jurisdiction, by force of section 91, no. 29, and sec. 92, no. 10, has certain powers of regulation touching the employment of persons engaged on such works or undertak\u00adings. The effect of such legislation by the Dominion to execution of this power is that provincial authority in relation to the subject matter of such legislation is superseded, and remains inoperative so long as the Dominion legislation continues in force. There would appear to be no doubt that, as regards such undertakings-a Dominion railway, for example-the Do-minion possesses authority to enact legislation in relation to the subjects dealt with in the draft convention.\nHe went on to say that, there having been no Dominion legislation on the subject, other than the empowering of the Board of Railway Commissioners to make regulations concerning hours of duty of railway employees with a view to the safety of the public and of the employees, which power had never been exercised by the Board, the primary authority of the provincial legislatures remained unim\u00adpaired.\nThis case lends some support to the argument that the federal power to legislate on the matter of hours of work in relation to undertakings subject to federal legislation under s. 92(10) is an ancillary rather than an exclusive power, but the issue did not have to be determined in that case.\nAs is pointed out in the Court below by Rinfret J., the judgment of this Court, delivered by Duff J. in the Ref\u00aderence re Waters and Water-Powers[7], contains, at p. 214, a reference to the fact that:\n\"railway legislation, strictly so called\" (in respect of such railways), is within the exclusive competence of the Dominion, and such legislation may include, inter alia, regulations for the construction, the repair and the alteration of the railway and for its management.\nHe referred to the case of Canadian Pacific Railway v Corporation of the Parish of Notre Dame de Bonsecours[8].\nAgain, at p. 226, he says:\nAs to the first branch, it seems unnecessary to say that a province would be exceeding its powers if it attempted to intervene in matters committed exclusively to Dominion control, by attempting, for example, to interfere with the structure or management of a work withdrawn entirely from provincial jurisdiction, such as a work authorized by the Dominion by legislation in execution of its powers under s. 92(10a).\nThere are two cases in this Court which, in my opinion, bear a closer relationship to the circumstances of the pres\u00adent case than either of the two authorities which I have just considered. The first of these is the Reference re the Minimum Wage Act of the Province of Saskatchewan[9] The question in issue there was as to whether the Act in question applied to one Leo Fleming, who had been hired temporarily and paid by a postmistress of a revenue post office at Maple Creek, Saskatchewan. It was held that it did not apply, even though Parliament had not dealt with the subject by legislation.\nRinfret C.J. and Taschereau J. (as he then was) both held that as the \"Postal Service\" was a matter of exclusive federal legislative jurisdiction under s. 92(5), the provincial legislation could not apply to Fleming.\nAs Taschereau J. put it, at p. 257:\nIt follows that the fixing of the wages of the Postal employees, is a matter in pith and substance \"Postal Service Legislation\", upon which the provinces may not legislate without invading a field \"exclusively\" assigned to the Dominion.\nRand J., with whom Locke J. concurred, said, at p. 263:\nI take this legislation to aim at the regulation of the business, occupation or employment in which the work of the employee for which the minimum wage is prescribed is carried out, and which, as well as the employer, is for such purposes within the legislative control of the province. In the case before us, the postmistress has neither business nor service of her own into which the employee is or can be introduced; and the actual employment to which the employee is committed is beyond provincial jurisdiction. The condition for the application of the statute is, therefore, absent. Were the post office operated as a private provincial business, I have no doubt that in the circumstances here the proprietor would be bound by the Act as employer and the postmistress as his agent,\n(The italics are my own.)\nKellock J. based his opinion on the proposition that a provincial legislature could not legislate as to the hours of labour of Dominion servants.\nEstey J., at p. 269, said :\nIf, therefore, the said employment of Fleming was within the \"Postal Service\" as that term is used in the B.N.A. Act, his employment was subject to Dominion legislation only.\nIn my view, the conclusion in this case is properly stated in the headnote, as follows:\nThe employee became employed in the business of the Post Office of Canada and therefore part of the Postal Service. His wages were, as such, within the exclusive legislative field of the Parliament of Canada and any encroachment by provincial legislation on that subject, must be looked upon as being ultra vires, whether or not Parliament has or has not dealt with the subject by legislation.\nI see no difference in principle between the position of an employee hired and paid, not by the Crown, but by an individual, but who was engaged in the Postal Service, s. 91(5), and an employee of an interprovincial undertaking, s. 91(29) and s. 92(10), in relation to the exclusive power of the federal parliament to legislate regarding his wage rate.\nThe other decision is in respect of the Reference as to the Validity of the Industrial Relations and Disputes Investi\u00adgation Act[10], to which I have already made some reference. This Court had to consider the validity of federal legisla\u00adtion in the field of labour relations applicable to businesses within the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada. The Act was held to be within the federal power, and the decision, in my view, did recognize that that field constituted an essential part of the operation of such an undertaking.\nWith respect, I subscribe to this view. In my opinion, regulation of the field of employer and employee relation-ships in an undertaking such as that of the respondent's, as in the case of the regulation of the rates which they charge to their customers, is a \"matter\" coming within the class of subject defined in s. 92(10) (a) and, that being so, is within the exclusive legislative jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada. Consequently, any provincial legislation in that field, while valid in respect of employers not within exclu\u00adsive federal legislative jurisdiction, cannot apply to em\u00adployers who are within that exclusive control.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs. There should be no costs payable by or to the intervenants.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nAttorney for the plaintiff, appellant: A.

Because there was an appeal and a reassessment of damages, it was not until January 1964 that the damages in the Fatal Accidents action were finally ascertained at a sum in excess of $90,000. In March 1963, J had begun a class action against the defendant insurance company under s. 219(1) of The Saskatchewan Insurance Act, 1960, suing on behalf of herself and all persons having judgments or claims against the insured T.\nAn action started by T in June 1962 against his insurer to recover his costs of defence and for a declaration that at the time of the collision he was entitled to be indemnified under his policy was dismissed on December 31, 1963, on the ground that T was in breach of the condition of the policy relating to the consumption of liquor.\nIn J\u2019s action against the insurance company a motion was brought in June 1965 which was designed to end the action. The insurance company sought to have it determined that J was bound by the judgment in T\u2019s action against his insurer, asserting that this was a complete defence to J\u2019s action in so far as excess coverage was concerned. The judge of first instance dismissed the motion and this dismissal was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. The insurance company then appealed to this Court.\nOn the opening of the appeal, a motion was made for an order quashing the appeal on the ground that the judgment appealed from was not a final judgment. Held: Both the motion to quash and the appeal should be dismissed.\nJ was not bound by the judgment in T\u2019s action to which she was not a party. T did not stand in any relationship of privy to her. She was entitled to have her right to recover against the insurance company determined in her statutory action under s. 219(1) of The Saskatchewan Insurance Act, 1960. T and the insurance company could not determine this right by litigation between themselves and then tell her that it was all over. The insurance company would have to prove its defence under this policy against her in her action and it was reasonable that they should do so. Global General Insurance Co. v. Finlay and Layng, [1961] S.C.R. 539, discussed.\nWith respect to the motion to quash, had the insurance company\u2019s motion, been granted in the Saskatchewan Courts, this would have finally disposed of the matter as to excess coverage. The liability to pay the statutory limit of $5,000 was never in question. Leave to appeal was, therefore, unnecessary.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan, dismissing an appeal from a judgment of MacDonald J. Appeal dismissed.\nR. Rees Brock and Richard J. Scott, for the defendant, appellant.\nJames A. Griffin and Harold A. Dietrich, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014Denise Lucille Marie Joynt sued two motorists, Topp and Ritco, for the death of her husband and injuries to her two children. The husband and children were innocent bystanders at the scene of the accident. Ritco was exonerated but Mrs. Joynt obtained two judgments against Topp, one as administratrix of the estate of her husband under The Fatal Accidents Act, R.S.S. 1953, c. 102, and one for injuries to the two children. Because there was an appeal and a reassessment of damages, it was not until January 1964 that the damages in the Fatal Accidents action were finally ascertained at a sum in excess of $90,000. In March 1963, Mrs. Joynt had begun the present class action against the insurance company under s. 219(1) of The Saskatchewan Insurance Act, 1960, 1960 (Sask.), c. 77, suing on behalf of herself and all persons having judgments or claims against the insured Topp.\nIn June of 1962, Topp had started an action against his insurer, the present appellant, Canada Security Assurance Company, to recover his costs of defence and for a declaration that at the time of the collision he was entitled to be indemnified under his policy. This action was dismissed by Tucker J. on December 31, 1963, on the ground that Topp was in breach of the condition of the policy relating to the consumption of liquor. No appeal was taken from this judgment.\nThe next step that we are concerned with in the Joynt action against the insurance company is a motion brought in June 1965 which was designed to end the action. The insurance company sought to have it determined that Mrs. Joynt was bound by the judgment of Tucker J. in Topp v. Canada Security Assurance Company, asserting that this was a complete defence to Mrs. Joynt\u2019s action in so far as excess coverage was concerned. MacDonald J. dismissed this motion. This dismissal was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. The insurance company now appeals to this Court.\nI do not think that Mrs. Joynt is bound by the judgment in the Topp action to which she was not a party. Topp did not stand in any relationship of privy to her. She is entitled to have her right to recover against the insurance company determined in her statutory action under s. 219(1) of The Saskatchewan Insurance Act, 1960. Topp and the insurance company cannot determine this right by litigation between themselves and then tell her that it is all over. The insurance company will have to prove its defence under this policy against her in her action and it is reasonable that they should do so. If they had been prudent they would have seen to it that both actions were on the list together at the trial. Then there would not have been the present difficulties.\nCounsel for the appellant submitted that Global General Insurance Company v. Finlay and Layng[1] was authority for his proposition that Mrs. Joynt is bound by the judgment in Topp v. Canada Security Assurance Company. I do not think that this submission is sound.\nAt the trial on the question of liability for the accident in the Global case the insurance company refused to defend. The car was originally owned by Rheta Campbell. She died and ownership of the car became vested in Margaret Jean Campbell, her executrix. Layng was the driver of the car at the time of the accident. He had the car with the consent of the executrix. The judge found that Layng was negligent and responsible for the accident, and that Margaret Jean Campbell was responsible as owner. The trial judge was not concerned with the terms of any insurance policy. He simply decided that Margaret Jean Campbell was the owner as executrix and, as owner, was responsible for the damages under The Highway Traffic Act.\nBoth Margaret Jean Campbell and Layng then sued the insurance company for indemnity. For the first time the question arose whether Margaret Jean Campbell was covered as executrix. The insurance company pleaded that she was not and that the policy covered Rheta Campbell and only during her lifetime. The trial judge in this action decided that the third party liability coverage terminated upon the death of Rheta Campbell.\nIn the Court of Appeal and in this Court it was held that where a policy provides for indemnity against third party liability to \u201cthe insured, his executors and administrators and\u2026 every other person who with the insured\u2019s consent personally drives the automobile\u201d, the insurer\u2019s obligation of indemnity continues during the policy period, even though the insured owner has died, where title to the car passes to the executrix and third party liability was incurred by a person driving the car with the executrix\u2019s consent.\nSo far there is nothing in the Global case to assist the appellant. The second point in the Global case deals with what must be proved in the statutory action. The insurance company had urged that the whole cause of action against the insured had to be proved. This was rejected at trial, on appeal and in this Court. The question in the statutory action is not whether the judgment in the liability action is correct but whether the plaintiff has a judgment against the insured for which indemnity is provided in the motor liability policy. A plaintiff in such an action proves his case by putting in the judgment against the insured, the insurance policy and proof of non-payment. All else is a matter of defence with the onus of proof on the insurance company.\nCounsel for Mrs. Joynt moved at the opening of the appeal for an order quashing the appeal on the ground that the judgment appealed from was not a final judgment. The motion to quash and the appeal were argued together and no additional costs were incurred. Had the insurance company\u2019s motion been granted in the Saskatchewan Courts, this would have finally disposed of the matter as to excess coverage. I think that counsel for the insurance company is right in saying that the liability to pay the statutory limit of $5,000 was never in question. Leave to appeal was, therefore, unnecessary.\nI would dismiss the motion to quash but without costs and would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nMotion to quash dismissed without costs; appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Thompson, Dilts & Co., Winnipeg.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: Pearce, Dietrich & Co., Regina.\n[1] [1961] S.C.R. 539.\n"}

At trial, he admitted having damaged the plumbing fixtures in the cell where he was incarcerated but, through his counsel, he sought to introduce evidence to show that he had committed this offence under the compulsion of threats and was therefore entitled to be excused by virtue of s. 17 of the Criminal Code and that he was also entitled to avail himself of the Common Law defence of \u201cduress\u201d by virtue of s. 7 of the Code. The nature of this evidence, as outlined by counsel for the accused, was that the offence had been committed during a disturbance in the course of which a substantial body of prisoners, shouting in unison from their separate cells, threatened the respondent, who was not joining in the disturbance, that if he did not break the plumbing fixtures in his cell he would be kicked in the head, his arms would be broken and he would get a knife in the back at the first opportunity. The trial judge ruled that the proposed evidence did not indicate a defence or excuse available at law and ruled the evidence inadmissible. The Court of Appeal held that the evidence should have been presented to the jury, quashed the conviction and ordered a new trial. The Crown appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed, and the conviction restored.\nThe trial judge was right in deciding that the proposed evidence did not afford an excuse within the meaning of s. 17 of the Criminal Code. The question of whether immediate threats of future death or grievous bodily harm constitute an excuse for committing a crime within the meaning of s. 17 of the Code and the question of whether a person can be present within the meaning of that section when he is locked in a separate cell from the place where the offence is committed are both questions which depend upon the construction to be placed on section 17 and they are therefore questions of law and not questions of fact for the jury. Accepting the outline made by defence counsel as being an accurate account of the evidence which was available, there was nothing in it to support the defence that the act was not done wilfully within the meaning of ss. 371(1) and 372(1) of the Code, and there was accordingly no ground to justify the trial judge in permitting the proposed evidence.\nDroit criminel\u2014Dommage \u00e0 un bien public caus\u00e9 ill\u00e9galement et volontairement\u2014D\u00e9fense de contrainte exerc\u00e9e par des menaces\u2014Le juge au proc\u00e8s a-t-il err\u00e9 en d\u00e9cidant que la preuve de contrainte \u00e9tait inadmissible\u2014L\u2019accus\u00e9 \u00e9tait-il en danger comme r\u00e9sultat des menaces\u2014Code Criminel, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, arts. 7, 17, 371, 372.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9 coupable d\u2019avoir caus\u00e9 ill\u00e9galement et volontairement du dommage \u00e0 un bien public.

Lewis, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014This is an appeal by the Attorney General of British Columbia from a judgment of the Court of Appeal1 of that Province, from which Mr. Justice MacLean dissented, and by which it was ordered that the respondent\u2019s conviction for unlawfully and wilfully damaging public property and thereby committing mischief, should be set aside and that a new trial should be had.\nAt the trial the respondent admitted having damaged the plumbing fixtures in the cell where he was incarcerated at Oakalla Prison Farm in British Columbia but, through his counsel, he sought to introduce evidence to show that he had committed this offence under the compulsion of threats and was therefore entitled to be excused for committing it by virtue of the provisions of s. 17 of the Criminal Code and that he was also entitled to avail himself of the common law defence of \u201cduress\u201d having regard to the provisions of s. 7 of the Criminal Code.\nUnder the latter section it is provided that:\nEvery rule and principle of the common law that renders any circumstance a justification or excuse for an act or a defence to a charge continues in force and applies in respect of proceedings for an offence under this Act\u2026 except in so far as they are altered by or are inconsistent with this Act or any other Act of the Parliament of Canada.\nThe italics are my own.\nI agree with the learned trial judge and with MacLean J.A. that in respect of proceedings for an offence under the Criminal Code the common law rules and principles respecting \u201cduress\u201d as an excuse or defence have been codified and exhaustively defined in s. 17 which reads as follows:\n17. A person who commits an offence under compulsion by threats of immediate death or grievous bodily harm from a person who is present when the offence is committed is excused for committing the offence if he believes that the threats will be carried out and if he is not a party to a conspiracy or association whereby he is subject to compulsion, but this section does not apply where the offence that is committed is treason, murder, piracy, attempted murder, assisting in rape, forcible abduction, robbery, causing bodily harm or arson.\nAt the outset of the proceedings at the trial in the present case and in the absence of the jury, Mr. Greenfield, who acted on behalf of the accused, informed the Court that he intended to call evidence of compulsion and duress and he elected to outline the nature of this evidence which was that the offence had been committed during a disturbance, apparently organized by way of protest, to damage property at the Prison Farm in the course of which a substantial body of prisoners, shouting in unison from their separate cells, threatened the respondent, who was not joining in the disturbance, that if he did not break the plumbing fixtures in his cell he would be kicked in the head, his arm would be broken and he would get a knife in the back at the first opportunity.\nThe question which the learned trial judge was required to determine on Mr. Greenfield\u2019s application was whether the proposed evidence which had been outlined to him indicated a defence or excuse available at law; he decided that it did not and the majority of the Court of Appeal having taken a different view, the Attorney General now appeals to this Court.\nThere can be little doubt that the evidence outlined by Mr. Greenfield, which was subsequently confirmed by the evidence given by the ringleaders of the disturbance in mitigation of sentence, disclosed that the respondent committed the offence under the compulsion of threats of death and grievous bodily harm, but although these threats were \u201cimmediate\u201d in the sense that they were continuous until the time that the offence was committed, they were not threats of \u201cimmediate death\u201d or \u201cimmediate grievous bodily harm\u201d and none of the persons who delivered them was present in the cell with the respondent when the offence was committed. I am accordingly of opinion that the learned trial judge was right in deciding that the proposed evidence did not afford an excuse within the meaning of s. 17 of the Criminal Code,\nIn the course of his most thoughtful judgment in the Court of Appeal, Mr. Justice Norris had occasion to say:\nThe question of whether or not a person threatening was present goes to the question of the grounds for the fear which the appellant might have. In my opinion a person could be present making a throat although separated by the bars of the cell. These are all matters which should have gone to the jury, as was the question of whether or not the threat of death or grievous bodily harm was an immediate one\u2014a question of degree. They might well consider that the threat was immediate as being continuous, as it was in this case, that it would be all the more frightening because of the uncertainty as to when it actually might happen, and therefore force him to act as he did.\nWith the greatest respect it appears to me that the question of whether immediate threats of future death or grievous bodily harm constitute an excuse for committing a crime within the meaning of s. 17 and the question of whether a person can be \u201cpresent\u201d within the meaning of that section when he is locked in a separate cell from the place where the offence is committed are both questions which depend upon the construction to be placed on the section and they are therefore questions of law and not questions of fact for the jury. See Vail v. The Queen[2] and The Queen v. Sikyea[3]. In support of the suggestion that the threat in the present case was \u201cimmediate and continuous\u201d Mr. Justice Norris relied on the case of Subramaniam v. Public Prosecutor[4], in which the Privy Council decided that the trial judge was wrong in excluding evidence of threats to which the appellant was subjected by Chinese terrorists in Malaya. In that case it was found that the threats were a continuous menace up to the moment when the appellant was captured because the terrorists might have come back at any time and carried them into effect. Section 94 of the Penal Code of the Federated Malay States, which the appellant sought to invoke in that case provided:\n94. Except murder and offences included in Chapter VI punishable with death, nothing is an offence which is done by a person who is compelled to do it by threats, which, at the time of doing it, reasonably cause the apprehension that instant death to that person will otherwise be the consequence;\u2026\nThe distinctions between the Subramaniam case and the present one lie in the fact that Subramaniam might well have had reasonable cause for apprehension that instant death would result from his disobeying the terrorists who might have come back at any moment, whereas it is virtually inconceivable that \u201cimmediate death\u201d or \u201cgrievous bodily harm\u201d could have come to Carker from those who were uttering the threats against him as they were locked up in separate cells, and it is also to be noted that the provisions of s. 17 of the Criminal Code are by no means the same as those of s. 94 of the Penal Code of the Federated Malay States; amongst other distinctions the latter section contains no provision that the person who utters the threats must be present when the offence is committed in order to afford an excuse for committing it.\nBoth Mr. Justice Norris and Mr. Justice Branca in delivering their separate reasons for judgment in the Court of Appeal, expressed the view that the evidence which was tendered should have been admitted on the issue of whether the respondent acted wilfully in damaging the prison plumbing or whether he was so affected by the threats uttered against him as to be incapable of adopting any other course than the one which he did. The relevant provisions of the Criminal Code read as follows:\n372(1) Every one commits mischief who wilfully\n(a) destroys or damages property,\u2026\n(3) Every one who commits mischief in relation to public property is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for fourteen years.\nOn this phase of the matter, Mr. Justice Norris had this to say:\nIn making the ruling which he did the learned trial judge deprived the appellant of what could be a substantial defence to the charge or an excuse under s. 17 without hearing the evidence. The jury could not decide whether the act was in fact wilful. This was not a matter on which the judge might rule. The length to which the evidence might go to disprove the essentials of the charge or to prove the requirements of s. 17 could never in the absence of the evidence of witnesses be apparent either to the learned judge or to the jury.\nWith the greatest respect, this portion of Mr. Justice Norris\u2019 reasons for judgment appears to overlook the fact that \u201cthe length to which the evidence might go\u2026\u201d was fully outlined to the learned judge by counsel for the respondent when he was making the application.\nIn this regard it is important to bear in mind the fact that \u201cwilful\u201d as it is used in Part IX of the Criminal Code is defined in s. 371 (1) which reads, in part, as follows:\n371(1) Every one who causes the occurrence of an event by doing an act or by omitting to do an act that it is his duty to do, knowing that the act or omission will probably cause the occurrence of the event and being reckless whether the event occurs or not, shall be deemed, for the purposes of this Part, wilfully to have caused the occurrence of the event.\nThe evidence outlined to the learned trial judge discloses that the criminal act was committed to preserve the respondent from future harm coming to him, but there is no suggestion in the evidence tendered for the defence that the accused did not know that what he was doing would \u201cprobably cause\u201d damage. Accepting the outline made by defence counsel as being an accurate account of the evidence which was available, there was in my view nothing in it to support the defence that the act was not done \u201cwilfully\u201d within the meaning of s. 371(1) and 372(1) of the Criminal Code and there was accordingly no ground to justify the learned trial judge in permitting the proposed evidence to be called in support of such a defence. In view of all the above, I would allow this appeal, set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal and restore the conviction.\nAppeal allowed and conviction restored.\nSolicitor for the appellant: G.L.

The trustee claimed that the gift was an absolute gift to a charitable organization and therefore exempt from estate tax by virtue of s. 7(1)(d)(i) of the Estate Tax Act, 1958 (Can.), c. 29. The trustee had the burden of establishing that the gift was an absolute and indefeasible gift, that the association was an organization constituted exclusively for charitable purposes, that the association was an organization all or substantially all of the resources of which were devoted to charitable activities and that no part of the resources of the association were available for the benefit of any member. The Exchequer Court upheld the Minister\u2019s contention that the gift was not exempt and ruled that it had not been established that the gift was absolute and indefeasible or that the association was an organization constituted exclusively for charitable purposes and that its resources were used exclusively for such purposes. The trustee appealed to this Court where the Minister raised the further submission, based on s. 115 of the Ontario Corporations Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 71, that since the association had not passed a by-law contemplated by s. 115(1), a part of its resources could, on dissolution, become available for the benefit of the members, contrary to s. 7(1)(d)(i) of the Estate Tax Act.\nHeld (Cartwright and Judson JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed as well as the claim for exemption.\nPer Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ.: The purposes of the association, as described in its letters patent, \u201cto promote and enlarge the usefulness and influence of the university\u201d and \u201cto promote the science and art of medicine\u201d were exclusively charitable purposes. The other objects and purposes for which the association was incorporated were not such as to deprive it of its character as a charity. These were incidental to the two main purposes above-referred and were a means to the fulfilment of these purposes rather than an end by themselves.\nIn any event, the question as to whether the association was constituted exclusively for charitable purposes could not be determined solely by a reference to the objects and purposes for which it was originally incorporated. The test of whether an organization is so constituted within the meaning of s. 7(1)(d)(i) is one which must be applied according to the association\u2019s activities at the time of the making of the gift and of the death of the deceased. The trial judge correctly found that by far the greatest part of the association\u2019s activities during the relevant time had been devoted to charitable purposes.\nFurthermore, the association came within s. 7(1)(d)(i) since all or substantially all of its remaining resources, after having paid for its operational and promotional expenses, were devoted to charitable activities carried on or to be carried on by it.\nThe gift in this case was an absolute and indefeasible gift within the meaning of s. 7(1)(d) of the Act. The fund making up the balance of the residue of the estate was made the subject of a vested indefeasible gift to the association and although the gift was stamped with a trust it did not contain any provision which might result in it being divested so that the association might never receive it.\nThe contention based on s. 115 of the Corporations Act, could not be sustained. A corporation with exclusively charitable objects, the letters patent of which expressly provide that any profits or other accretions to the corporation shall be used in promoting its objects, could not be one to which the provisions of s. 115 were intended to apply. The enactment of any such by-law as is contemplated by s. 115 would be redundant. Per Cartwright and Judson JJ., dissenting: The gift in question was an absolute gift. However, the association was not at the date of the death of the testatrix an organization constituted exclusively for charitable purposes, and it has not been shown that all or mainly all of its resources were devoted to charitable activities.\nRevenu\u2014Imp\u00f4t successoral\u2014Exemption\u2014Donation \u00e0 une association des anciens \u00e9l\u00e8ves de m\u00e9decine d\u2019une universit\u00e9\u2014Pour \u00e9tablir un fonds d\u2019emprunt pour les \u00e9tudiants\u2014Donation est-elle absolue et irr\u00e9vocable\u2014L\u2019association est-elle une organisation constitu\u00e9e exclusivement \u00e0 des fins de charit\u00e9\u2014Les ressources de l\u2019association sont-elles affect\u00e9es \u00e0 des \u0153uvres de charit\u00e9\u2014Corporations Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 71, arts. 101, 109(1), 115(1) et (5)\u2014Loi de l\u2019Imp\u00f4t sur les biens transmis par d\u00e9c\u00e8s, 1958 (Can.), c. 21, art. 7(1)(d)(i).\nLa testatrice est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e le 11 juillet 1961 et a pourvu \u00e0 la distribution du reliquat de sa succession en ordonnant \u00e0 son fiduciaire de payer et de distribuer ce reliquat \u00e0 l\u2019Association des anciens \u00e9l\u00e8ves de m\u00e9decine de l\u2019Universit\u00e9 de Toronto pour \u00e9tablir un fonds d\u2019emprunt pour les \u00e9tudiants, devant \u00eatre administr\u00e9 par l\u2019association, dans le but de pr\u00eater des fonds aux \u00e9tudiantes en m\u00e9decine de l\u2019universit\u00e9.

Le fiduciaire avait le fardeau d\u2019\u00e9tablir que la donation \u00e9tait une donation absolue et irr\u00e9vocable, que l\u2019association \u00e9tait une organisation constitu\u00e9e exclusivement \u00e0 des fins de charit\u00e9, que l\u2019association \u00e9tait une organisation dont toutes ou sensiblement toutes les ressources \u00e9taient affect\u00e9es \u00e0 des \u0153uvres de charit\u00e9 et qu\u2019aucune partie des ressources de l\u2019association n\u2019\u00e9tait disponible \u00e0 l\u2019avantage de ses membres.\nLa Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier a confirm\u00e9 la pr\u00e9tention du Ministre que la donation n\u2019\u00e9tait pas exempte de la taxe et a jug\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli que la donation \u00e9tait absolue et irr\u00e9vocable ou que l\u2019association \u00e9tait une organisation constitu\u00e9e exclusivement \u00e0 des fins de charit\u00e9 et que ses ressources servaient exclusivement \u00e0 ces fins. Le fiduciaire en appela devant cette Cour alors que le Ministre a soutenu en plus, en se basant sur l\u2019art. 115 du Corporations Act de l\u2019Ontario, R.S.O. 1960, c. 71, que puisque l\u2019association n\u2019avait pas pass\u00e9 un r\u00e8glement tel qu\u2019envisag\u00e9 par l\u2019art. 115(1), une partie de ses ressources pouvaient, lors de la dissolution, devenir disponibles \u00e0 l\u2019avantage des membres, le tout contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019art. 7(1)(d)(i) de la Loi de l\u2019Imp\u00f4t sur les biens transmis par d\u00e9c\u00e8s.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel doit \u00eatre maintenu ainsi que la demande d\u2019exemption, les Juges Cartwright et Judson \u00e9tant dissidents.\nLes Juges Ritchie, Hall et Spence: Les buts de l\u2019association, tels que d\u00e9crits dans ses lettres patentes, de promouvoir et d\u2019\u00e9tendre l\u2019utilit\u00e9 et l\u2019influence de l\u2019universit\u00e9 et aussi de promouvoir la science et l\u2019art de la m\u00e9decine, \u00e9taient des buts exclusivement charitables. Les autres objets et buts pour lesquels l\u2019association avait \u00e9t\u00e9 incorpor\u00e9e n\u2019\u00e9taient pas tels qu\u2019ils pouvaient priver l\u2019association de son caract\u00e8re de charit\u00e9. Ceux-ci sont compris dans les deux buts d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9s et \u00e9taient des moyens d\u2019accomplir ces buts plut\u00f4t qu\u2019une fin en elle-m\u00eame.\nA tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, la question de savoir si l\u2019association \u00e9tait constitu\u00e9e exclusivement \u00e0 des fins de charit\u00e9 ne peut pas \u00eatre d\u00e9termin\u00e9e seulement en se r\u00e9f\u00e9rant aux objets et buts pour lesquels elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 originellement incorpor\u00e9e. Le crit\u00e8re pour savoir si une organisation est ainsi constitu\u00e9e dans le sens de l\u2019art. 7(1)(d)(i), en est un qui doit \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9 en se basant sur les \u0153uvres de l\u2019association lors de la donation et de la mort du d\u00e9funt. Le juge au proc\u00e8s a correctement \u00e9mis l\u2019opinion que la plus grande part des \u0153uvres de l\u2019association durant le temps en question avait \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9e \u00e0 des fins de charit\u00e9.\nL\u2019association tombait aussi sous l\u2019art. 7(1)(d)(i) puisque tout ou sensiblement tout le reste des ressources de l\u2019association, apr\u00e8s avoir pay\u00e9 les d\u00e9penses d\u2019op\u00e9ration et de promotion, \u00e9tait affect\u00e9 \u00e0 des \u0153uvres de charit\u00e9 accomplies ou \u00e0 \u00eatre accomplies par elle.\nLa donation dans le cas pr\u00e9sent \u00e9tait une donation absolue et irr\u00e9vocable dans le sens de l\u2019art. 7(1)(d) de la loi. Les fonds constituant le reliquat de la succession sont devenus le sujet d\u2019une donation irr\u00e9vocable d\u00e9volue \u00e0 l\u2019association, et quoique la donation soit marqu\u00e9e d\u2019un fid\u00e9icommis elle ne contient aucune disposition qui pourrait avoir comme r\u00e9sultat de le d\u00e9poss\u00e9der \u00e0 un point que l\u2019association ne pourrait jamais recevoir la donation.\nLa pr\u00e9tention bas\u00e9e sur l\u2019art. 115 du Corporations Act ne peut pas \u00eatre maintenue. Une corporation ayant des buts exclusivement charitables, et dont les lettres patentes pr\u00e9voient express\u00e9ment que tout profit ou autre bien accru \u00e0 la corporation doivent servir \u00e0 promouvoir ses buts, ne peut pas \u00eatre une corporation \u00e0 qui les dispositions de l\u2019art. 115 sont cens\u00e9es s\u2019appliquer.

Appel maintenu, les Juges Cartwright et Judson \u00e9tant dissidents. APPEAL from a judgment of Cattanach J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, in a matter of estate tax. Appeal allowed, Cartwright and Judson JJ. dissenting.\nTerence Sheard, Q.C., for the appellant.\nG.W. Ainslie and D.G.H. Bowman, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Cartwright and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):\u2014The questions raised on this appeal, the facts and surrounding circumstances, the relevant legislation and the terms of the will of the late Dorothy Elgin Towle are set out in the reasons of my brother Ritchie which I have had the advantage of reading; I shall endeavour as far as possible to avoid repetition.\nThe learned trial judge stated correctly that in order to make good its contention that the value of the gift of the balance of the residue of the estate of the testatrix to the Medical Alumni Association of the University of Toronto should be deducted from the aggregate net value of the property passing on her death in accordance with s. 7(1)(d)(i) of the Estate Tax Act, it was necessary for the appellant to shew:\n(a) that the gift in question was an absolute gift to the Medical Alumni Association within the meaning of paragraph (d) of subsection (1) of section 7;\n(b) that the Medical Alumni Association, at the time of the deceased\u2019s death, was an organization constituted exclusively for charitable purposes within the meaning of sub\u2011paragraph (i) of the said paragraph (d);\n(c) that, at the time of the deceased\u2019s death, the Medical Alumni Association was an organization all or substantially all of the resources of which were devoted to charitable activities within the meaning of sub-paragraph (i) of the said paragraph (d);\n(d) that no part of the resources of the Medical Alumni Association were payable to or otherwise available for the benefit of any member.\nAs to item (a), for the reasons given by my brother Ritchie, to which I have nothing to add, I agree with his conclusion that the gift in question was an absolute one. As to items (b) and (c), I agree with the conclusions of the learned trial judge that the Medical Alumni Association was not at the date of the death of the testatrix an organization constituted exclusively for charitable purposes and that it was not shewn that all or substantially all of its resources were devoted to charitable activities. I am in substantial agreement with the reasons of the learned trial judge for reaching these conclusions.\nI find it unnecessary to deal with the question raised in item (d) and I express no opinion upon it.\nWhat I have said above is sufficient to dispose of the appeal but before parting with the matter I venture to express my agreement with the submission of Mr. Sheard that the result, at which I feel bound by the words of the statute to arrive, is anomalous. The residue of the estate of the testatrix is given on a valid charitable trust. It is clear that it can never be used for any purpose other than the charitable one to which it is devoted. It is axiomatic that a validly constituted charitable trust will not be allowed to fail for lack of a trustee. In Re Schechter[2], the majority of this Court cited with approval the following sentence from the judgment of Lord Macnaghten in Dunne v. Byrne[3]:\nIt is difficult to see on what principle a trust expressed in plain language, whether the words used be sufficient or insufficient to satisfy the requirements of the law, can be modified or limited in its scope by reference to the position or character of the trustee.\nI find it difficult to suggest any reason why the answer to the question whether a fund validly and irrevocably committed to solely charitable purposes should be exempted from the payment of estate tax should depend on the nature of the other activities carried on by the trustee who happens to be appointed to administer the fund. However, the words of the legislation are unambiguous and the anomaly, if anomaly it be, would seem to be intended by Parliament to exist; attention was focused upon it as long ago as the decision of the Judicial Committee in Minister of National Revenue v. Trusts and Guaranty Company[4].In dealing with a similarly worded provision in the Income War Tax Act Lord Romer said at page 149:\nHad the Dominion Legislature intended to exempt from taxation the income of every charitable trust nothing would have been easier than to say so.\nSpeculation as to the possible reason for enacting a piece of legislation is of no assistance in its construction if the words used are plain.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nThe judgment of Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment rendered by Mr. Justice Cattanach in the Exchequer Court of Canada[5] affirming an assessment made by the Minister of National Revenue under the Estate Tax Act, 1958 (Can.), c. 29, whereby he disallowed a claim for deduction made by the executor of the estate of Dorothy Elgin Towle deceased, in respect of a gift made in the residuary clause of her will to \u201cthe Medical Alumnae Association of the University of Toronto\u201d, by which name it is agreed that the testator intended to refer to the \u201cMedical Alumni Association of the University of Toronto\u201d (hereinafter called the \u201cAssociation\u201d). In reaching his conclusion the Minister made the express finding that:\n\u2026the Medical Alumnae Association of the University of Toronto is not a charitable organization and the value of the gift made to it by the late Dorothy Elgin Towle is properly disallowed as a deduction under paragraph (d) of subsection (1) of section 7 of the Act for the purpose of computing the aggregate taxable value of the property passing on the death of the said Dorothy Elgin Towle.\nThe late Dorothy Elgin Towle, who was a physician and a member of the Association, died on July 11, 1961, having first made her last will and testament, probate of which was duly granted to the appellant, the executor therein named, and whereby she provided for the disposition of the balance of the residue of her estate by directing her trustee:\nTo pay and distribute the balance of the residue of my said estate to the Medical Alumnae Association of the University of Toronto to establish a student loan fund to be known as the \u2018Robert Elgin Towle Loan Fund\u2019 to be supervised and managed by the said Medical Alumnae Association for the purpose of loaning funds to women medical students of the University of Toronto who are in need of financial assistance during their course in medicine and any loan made under such fund to be paid after graduation without interest upon such terms and conditions as may be made from time to time by the said Medical Alumnae Association.\nThe italics are my own.\nIt is agreed between the parties that the trust for which provision is made in this paragraph of the testator\u2019s will is a \u201ctrust for charitable purposes\u201d but the learned trial judge took the view that it had not been established that the gift was \u201cabsolute and indefeasible\u201d or that the Association was \u201can organization constituted exclusively for charitable purposes\u201d within the meaning of s. 7(1)(d) of the Act which reads as follows:\n7. (1) For the purpose of computing the aggregate taxable value of the property passing on the death of a person, there may be deducted from the aggregate net value of that property\u2026such of the following amounts as are applicable:\n(d) the value of any gift made by the deceased whether during his lifetime or by his will, where such gift can be established to have been absolute and indefeasible, to\n(i) any organization in Canada that, at the time of the making of the gift and of the death of the deceased, was an organization constituted exclusively for charitable purposes, all or substantially all of the resources of which, if any, were devoted to charitable activities carried on or to be carried on by it or to the making of gifts to other such organizations in Canada, all or substantially all of the resources of which were so devoted, or to any donee described in subparagraph (ii), and no part of the resources of which was payable to or otherwise available for the benefit of any proprietor, member or shareholder thereof, or\u2026\nThe Association was incorporated pursuant to the laws of the Province of Ontario by Letters Patent dated April 28, 1947, for the following purposes and objects:\n(a) TO maintain and promote the interest of the graduates in medicine of the University of Toronto in their Alma Mater; (b) TO encourage and cultivate good-fellowship among the members of the Association;\n(c) TO promote and enlarge the usefulness and influence of the Provincial University;\n(d) TO consider and make recommendations on matters pertaining to I the welfare of the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Toronto;\n(e) Generally to promote the science and art of medicine;\n(f) TO administer and invest funds received from life members of the Association and any other funds and bequests of which the Association may from time to time have custody and to apply and disburse the moneys so administered in accordance with the provisions and conditions relating to the same; and\n(g) TO do all such other things as are incidental or conducive to the attainment of the above objects.\nIn my view the purposes described in paras. (c) and (e) of these Letters Patent are \u201ccharitable purposes\u201d.\nIn the course of the judgment in the House of Lords in Commissioners for Special Purposes of Income Tax v. Pemsel[6], Lord Mcnaghten observed:\nThat according to the law of England a technical meaning is attached to the word \u2018charity\u2019, and to the word \u2018charitable\u2019 in such expressions as \u2018charitable uses,\u2019 \u2018charitable trusts,\u2019 or \u2018charitable purposes,\u2019 cannot, I think, be denied.\nand he proceeded at page 583 to define that meaning in the following terms:\n\u2018Charity\u2019 in its legal sense comprises four principal divisions: trusts for the relief of poverty; trusts for the advancement of education; trusts for the advancement of religion; and trusts for other purposes beneficial to the community, not falling under any of the preceding heads.\nThis definition has received general acceptance in this country, subject to the consideration that in order to qualify as \u201ccharitable\u201d the purposes must, to use the words of Lord Wrenbury in Verge v. Summerville[7], be \u201cFor the benefit of the community or of an appreciably important class of the community\u201d. See also In re Cox; Baker v. National Trust Company et al[8], which was affirmed in the Privy Council[9]. In light of this definition it seems to me that an organization which had as its sole object \u201cthe promotion and enlargement of the usefulness and influence of the Provincial University\u201d would be \u201can organization constituted exclusively\u201d for the charitable purpose of \u201cthe advancement of education\u201d and this view is, in my opinion, borne out by the decision of the Court of Appeal in England in Rex v. Special Commissioners of Income Tax; University College of North Wales[10], where it was held that a college which was dependent for its sources of income on voluntary donations, devises and bequests and a government grant in addition to the fees paid by pupils was a charity within the meaning of the Income Tax Acts of 1842 and 1853.\nI am equally satisfied that an organization which had as its sole object \u201cGenerally to promote the science and art of medicine\u201d would be \u201can organization constituted exclusively for charitable purposes\u201d. The purpose described in para. (e) of the Letters Patent appears to me to come within the language used by Lord Normand in Royal College of Surgeons of England v. National Provincial Bank Ld.[11], where the House of Lords was required to decide whether a gift to the Royal College of Surgeons was a charitable gift so as to avoid the application of the rule against perpetuities and in so doing considered one of the recitals in the Royal Charter of the College where it was stated:\n\u2018It appears to us that the establishment of a College of Surgeons will be expedient for the due promotion and encouragement of the study and practice of the said art and science\u2019 of surgery.\nAt page 641 Lord Normand said:\n\u2026the next step is to construe that recital. The words \u2018the study and practice of the art and science\u2019 of surgery do not, in my opinion, mean \u2018the academic study and professional practice of the art and science of surgery\u2019; they signify rather the acquisition of knowledge and skill in surgery both by abstract study and by the exercise of the art in the dissecting room and the anatomy theatre, and they are capable of covering both the discovery of new knowledge, which is the fruit of research, and the learning of existing knowledge either by students who are qualifying or by qualified surgeons desirous of improving their knowledge and skill. On that construction the professed objects of the college all fall into the categories of the advancement of science or of the advancement of education, and are charitable.\nIt is perhaps desirable to observe that when the purpose described in para, (e) is read in its context, it is apparent that it relates to the \u201cpromotion of the science and art of medicine\u201d through the medium of the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Toronto.\nIf the purposes described in paras. (c) and (e) of the Letters Patent are exclusively charitable as I think they are, then it remains to be determined whether the other objects and purposes for which the Association was incorporated are such as to deprive it of its character as a charity. In this regard I subscribe to the reasoning of Denning L.J. in British Launderers\u2019 Research Association v. Hendon Rating Authority[12], in which case the Court of Appeal was considering whether the Association with which it was concerned was \u201cinstituted for the purposes of science, literature of the fine arts exclusively\u201d within the meaning of s. (1) of the Scientific Societies Act, 1843, and Denning L.J. had occasion to observe:\nIt is not sufficient that the society should be instituted \u2018mainly\u2019 or \u2018primarily\u2019 or \u2018chiefly\u2019 for the purposes of science, literature or the fine arts. It must be instituted \u2018exclusively\u2019 for those purposes. The only qualification\u2014which, indeed, is not really a qualification at all\u2014is that other purposes which are merely incidental to the purposes of science and literature or the fine arts, that is, merely a means to the fulfilment of those purposes, do not deprive a society of the exemption. Once however, the other purposes cease to be merely incidental but become collateral; that is, cease to be a means to an end, but become an end in themselves; that is, become additional purposes of the society; then, whether they be main or subsidiary, whether they exist jointly with or separately from the purposes of science, literature or the fine arts, the society cannot claim the exemption.\nIn considering the other purposes and objects of the Association it seems to me, in the first place, that if the purpose referred to in para. (d) is not itself a charitable purpose, it is certainly incidental to \u201cthe promotion of the science and art of medicine\u201d. I am satisfied that in achieving this latter object one of the essential and paramount considerations must of necessity be \u201cto consider\u2026 matters pertaining to the welfare of the faculty of medicine at the University of Toronto\u201d and I can only regard this purpose as being a \u201cmeans of the fulfilment\u201d of the purpose referred to in para. (e).\nAs will hereafter appear, I have also formed the opinion that the purposes referred to in paras. (a) and (b) of the Letters Patent are descriptive of means by which the continued existence of the Association is to be maintained and encouraged.\nI am, however, of opinion that as the Association is a Letters Patent Company, the question of whether it was \u201cconstituted exclusively for charitable purposes\u201d cannot be determined solely by reference to the objects and purposes for which it was originally incorporated. In this regard, I adopt the statement made by Lord Denning in Institution of Mechanical Engineers v. Cane[13], where the House of Lords was again concerned with the application of s. (1) of the Scientific Societies Act, 1843, and where he said:\n\u2026the first question is whether the Institution of Mechanical Engineers is a \u2018society instituted for the purpose of science exclusively.\u2019 I do not think this question is to be solved by looking at the royal charter alone and construing it as if you were sitting aloft in an ivory tower, oblivious of the purposes which the institution has in fact pursued. That would be proper enough if you had only to consider the purposes for which the society was originally instituted. But that is not the test. A society may be originally instituted for certain purposes and afterwards adopt other purposes. You then have to ask yourself this question: for what purpose is the society at present instituted?\nThat the test of whether an organization is \u201cconstituted exclusively for charitable purposes\u201d within the meaning of s. 7(1)(d)(i) of the Estate Tax Act is one which must be applied according to the association\u2019s activities \u201cat the time of the making of the gift and of the death of the deceased\u201d, is clear from the wording of the section itself, and this is further borne out by the fact that in order to be entitled to the deduction, the organization is required to be one \u201call or substantially all of the resources of which, if any, were devoted to charitable activities carried on or to be carried on by it or to the making of gifts to other such organizations in Canada\u2026\u201d. (The italics are, of course, my own.)\nThe evidence concerning the activities to which the Association was devoted at the relevant time is summarized by the learned trial judge in the following passage of his reasons for judgment:\nIt is sufficient to summarize such evidence in general terms. The Association had a small salaried staff which worked in premises put at the disposal of the Association by the University of Toronto without charge. The Association held its annual meeting in conjunction with an annual dinner. The staff published a magazine for the members and supplied services to the members of the various graduating years to encourage them to have reunion meetings. The staff carried on the usual activities designed to induce members to pay their annual fees and to subscribe to the funds administered by the Association. It was manifest, however, that by far the greatest part of the Association\u2019s effort, during recent years in any event, was the operation of scholarship, bursary and loan funds for medical students at the University of Toronto, making of gifts to be spent by the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine and the President of the University to be expended in their official capacities and other activities designed to supplement the work of the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Toronto.\nI am of opinion that this excerpt from the learned trial judge\u2019s reasons for judgment constitutes a finding, with which I agree, that by far the greatest part of the Association\u2019s effort during recent years has been devoted to charitable purposes.\nCounsel on behalf of the respondent contended that the \u201cmaking of gifts to be spent by the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine and the President of the University to be expended in their official capacities\u201d did not constitute the making of gifts for charitable purposes and in so doing he referred to the well-known case of Dunne v. Byrne[14], but in this regard I take the principle to have been accurately stated by Jenkins L.J. in In re Spensley\u2019s Will Trusts[15], where he adopted the language suggested by counsel in that case and after referring to the cases summarized in In re Flinn[16], he went on to say:\nThe principle deducible from those authorities was thus stated by counsel: \u2018Where there is a gift to a person who holds an office the duties of which are in their nature wholly charitable and the gift is made to him in his official name and by virtue of his office, then, if the purposes are not expressed in the gift itself, the gift is assumed to be for the charitable purposes inherent in the office.\u2019\nThis statement of principle was reiterated by Jenkins L.J. in Re Rumball[17].\nThe same question was dealt with in this Court by Judson J. in Blais v. Touchet[18], where there was a gift to the \u201cBishop of Prince Albert, for his works, but for such of the works as would aid the cause of the French Canadians of his diocese\u201d. After having referred to the judgment of Evershed M.R. in In re Rumball, supra, Mr. Justice Judson went on to say:\nA recent author, Keeton in The Modern Law of Charities (1952) p. 65, has commented that this branch of the law of charities is suffering from over-technicality. I join with others who have said that they do not wish to add to it. I therefore follow the line of reasoning in In re Garrad, (1907 1 Chancery 382) In re Flinn and In re Rumball and hold that this particular gift to the bishop is charitable by virtue of his office and that the testator did not step outside the charitable field in imposing the limitation to work among French Canadians.\nAs I have indicated, I regard the \u201cgifts to be spent by the Dean\u2026 and the President of the University to be expended in their official capacities\u201d as charitable.\nHaving found, as I think he did, that by far the greatest part of the Association\u2019s effort was charitable, the learned trial judge went on to say:\nHowever, there is no evidence upon which I can make a finding that the carrying on of activities such as those referred to in the immediately preceding sentence constitutes the exclusive object of the Association and that the other activities of the Association are merely subsidiary and incidental thereto. While such activities may have tended to overshadow, at times, in the minds of the officers of the Association, the activities that were designed, for example, \u2018to encourage and cultivate good-fellowship among the members of the Association\u2019, these latter activities, and probably others, in my view, never ceased to have their place as principal reasons for the existence of the Association.\nIn my view the activities of the Association which are calculated to ensure its continued existence are to be distinguished from the purposes for which it exists. If, as I think to be the case, the objects of promoting the usefulness and influence of the University and generally promoting the science and art of medicine are exclusively charitable purposes, then it seems to me to be clear that the means by which these purposes are to be promoted constitute an essential ingredient of the purposes themselves.\nIt having been established \u201cthat by far the greatest part of the Association\u2019s effort\u201d was devoted to charitable purposes \u201cat the time of the making of the gift and the time of the death of the deceased\u201d it remains to be determined whether the other purposes of the Association can be said to be \u201can end in themselves\u201d to use the language employed by Lord Denning in the British Launderers\u2019 Research Association case. In this regard I only find it necessary to refer to the objects and purposes described in paras, (a) and (b) of the objects clause of the Letters Patent of the Association.\nThe object described in paragraph (a), i.e. \u201cTo maintain and promote the interest of the graduates in medicine of the University of Toronto in their Alma Mater\u201d, appears to me to be one which is singularly ill adapted to being described as an end in itself. I find it difficult to attach any reality to the task of maintaining and promoting the interests of the graduates of a university in their alma mater unless that interest is being maintained and promoted for some purpose. On the other hand, the fulfilment of this object in my opinion provides an obvious means to promote and enlarge \u201cthe usefulness and influence of the Provincial University\u201d. I think, therefore, that the object described in para, (a) is to be treated as being \u201ca means to the fulfilment\u201d of the purpose described in para (c).\nWith the greatest respect for those who may hold a different opinion, I also have the very greatest difficulty in viewing the object described in para. (b), i.e., \u201cTo encourage and cultivate good fellowship among the members of the Association\u201d as being an end in itself. It is true that many associations do exist for the purpose of good fellowship alone, but the Medical Alumni Association of the University of Toronto is composed of doctors of medicine whose common bond is an interest in their profession and in the University of which they are graduates, and as by far the greatest part of its effort is devoted to \u201cactivities designed to supplement the work of the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Toronto\u201d it appears to me to be inappropriate to proceed on the assumption that the cultivation of good fellowship as an end in itself has any place in the structure of such an association.\nThe Association holds an annual meeting at which the members discuss matters of common professional interest and during that meeting an annual dinner is held at some expense to the Association. It is this annual dinner which is singled out by counsel for the respondent as being emblematic of the fact that the cultivation of good fellowship for its own sake is an additional purpose of the Association which detracts from the exclusively charitable character of the purposes to which it is devoting the greatest part of its effort. In my view, social gatherings of the members are in no way inconsistent with the exclusively charitable purposes of any charitable organizations; I think, on the other hand, that the holding of dinners, luncheons, teas, receptions and other such gatherings are important \u201cmeans to the fulfilment\u201d of the purposes of such organizations and I am accordingly of the opinion that the object described in para, (d) of the Letters Patent does not constitute an end in itself but is rather to be regarded as a means of furthering the purposes to which the Association\u2019s main effort is devoted.\nIt appears to me that the annual meeting, the annual dinner and the magazine which is circulated amongst the members are clearly designed as means of keeping the Association alive and that in this sense, they indeed \u201chave their place as principal reasons for the existence of the Association\u201d; but under the circumstances I do not think that these activities can be regarded as anything more than methods of achieving the charitable ends to which the learned trial judge has referred.\nI am far from suggesting that all university alumni associations are \u201cconstituted exclusively for charitable purposes\u201d but I think when the objects of the present Association are considered in conjunction with the purposes to which it has been found to have been devoting the greatest part of its effort, that it is one to which the provisions of s. 7(1)(d)(i) do apply. I am of opinion also that after having paid for its operational and promotional expenses \u201call or substantially all\u201d of its remaining resources \u201cwere devoted to charitable activities carried on or to be carried on by it\u2026\u201d.\nThe learned trial judge was, however, also of opinion that the deduction for which provision is made in s. 7(1)(d) of the Act could not be allowed in respect of the gift here in question because it was in his opinion not established \u201cto have been absolute and indefeasible\u201d. In this regard the learned trial judge said, in part:\nDealing first with the question whether the direction in the testatrix\u2019s will to pay the residue of her estate to the Medical Alumni Association to establish a student loan fund for the purpose of loaning funds to women medical students, created an absolute gift to the Association within the introductory portion of paragraph (d) of subsection (1) of section 7 of the Estate Tax Act, I am relieved of the necessity of deciding the character of the monies in the hands of the Association by agreement between the parties, in effect, that the monies are received by the Association in trust for charitable purposes. That being so, I am of the opinion that there was no \u2018gift\u2019 to the Association and certainly therefore no \u2018absolute\u2019 gift to the Association within the meaning of paragraph (d). The purpose of the said paragraph (d) is to provide a means whereby gifts for charitable purposes can be made so as not to attract estate tax but Parliament has not seen fit, in the Estate Tax Act, to provide an exemption for charitable trusts.\nIn support of this proposition, the learned trial judge refers to the case of Minister of National Revenue v. Trusts and Guarantee Company, Limited[19]. In that case the contention that the donee was a charitable institution was found to be \u201cobviously absurd\u201d and with the greatest respect this factor appears to me to distinguish it from the present case. In my respectful opinion, the reasons for judgment of Thurlow J. in Halley Estate v. M.N.R.[20] which were endorsed without further comment by this Court[21] appear to me to be entirely relevant to the present case and I adopt them as explaining the true meaning of the word \u201cabsolute\u201d as used in s. 7(1)(d). Mr. Justice Thurlow there said of the provisions of s. 7(1)(d) as it then read:\nThe intention of this provision is apparently to permit the deduction of the value of what is given to the particular recipients and with this in mind it seems to me that it is more natural to interpret the word \u2018absolute\u2019 in the paragraph from the point of view of the recipient than from the point of view of the deceased and as referring to the irrevocable and undefeatable vesting of the subject matter of the gift in the recipient rather than to the unlimited extent of the interest given to the recipient\u2026 Moreover while I can see no reason why Parliament should have intended to draw a distinction between a gift of an unlimited interest and an indefeasible gift for a lesser interest and to permit deduction of the value in the one case but not in the other it is not difficult to understand that in authorizing the deduction of the value of a gift to such a body Parliament would be concerned to ensure that the deduction should not be permitted when because of the provisions attaching to the gift, the body referred to in s. 7(1)(d) might never receive it. The word used is an apt one to make such a distinction and secure this object. I am accordingly of the opinion that the word \u2018absolute\u2019 in s. 7(1)(d) should be interpreted as meaning vested and indefeasible.\nIn the present case the fund making up \u201cthe balance of the residue\u201d of the estate was made the subject of a vested indefeasible gift to the Association and although the gift was stamped with a trust it did not contain any provision which might result in it being divested so that the Association might never receive it. It was an indefeasible gift of something less than an unlimited interest and accordingly, in my view, it was \u201cabsolute and indefeasible\u201d within the meaning of the section.\nCounsel for the Minister of National Revenue advanced a further argument in support of his contention that s. 7(1) (d)(i) did not apply to this Association and in so doing referred to the provisions of s. 115(1) and (5) of the Corporations Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 71, which read as follows:\n115(1) A Corporation may pass by-laws providing that upon its dissolution and after the payment of all debts and liabilities its remaining property or part thereof shall be distributed or disposed of to charitable organizations or to organizations whose objects are beneficial to the community.\n(5) In the absence of such by-law and upon the dissolution of the corporation the whole of its remaining property shall be distributed equally among the members or, if Letters Patent, Supplementary Letters Patent or by-laws so provide, among the members of a class or classes of members.\nIt was argued that as no such by-law had been, passed by the Association, a part of its resources could on dissolution become available for the benefit of a member thereof and that it was therefore not an organization entitled to the benefit of the deduction for which provision is made in s. 7 (1)(d)(i).\nThe fallacy of this argument appears to me to be that Part III of the Corporations Act, in which s. 115 appears, applies to two different kinds of corporations. This is apparent from the provisions of s. 101 which read as follows:\nA corporation may be incorporated to which Part V or Part VI applies or that has objects that are of a patriotic, religious, philanthropic, charitable, educational, agricultural, scientific, artistic, social, professional, fraternal, sporting or athletic nature or that are of any other useful nature. (The italics are my own).\nIn the case of corporations other than Co-operative Corporations (Part V) and Insurance Corporations (Part VI) the members are expressly excluded from participation in \u201cany profits or other accretions to the corporation\u201d by s. 109(1) which reads:\nA corporation, except a corporation to which Part V or VI applies, shall be carried on without the purpose of gain for its members and any profits or other accretions to the corporation shall be used in promoting its objects and the letters patent shall so provide. (The italics are my own).\nSuch a provision is contained in the Letters Patent of the Association here in question.\nIt seems to me that a corporation with exclusively charitable objects, the Letters Patent of which expressly provide that \u201cany profits or other accretions to the corporation shall be used in promoting its objects\u201d, cannot be one to which the provisions of s. 115 were intended to apply. On the dissolution of such a corporation \u201cits remaining property\u201d is in my opinion, under the terms of its Letters Patent, required to be used in promoting objects \u201cbeneficial to the community\u201d and the enactment of any such by-law as is contemplated by s. 115 would therefore be redundant.\nFor all these reasons I would allow this appeal with costs, set aside the assessment of the Minister of National Revenue and allow the claim for deduction made by the Executor of the estate of Dorothy Elgin Towle in respect of the gift made in the residuary clause of her will to \u201cthe Medical Alumnae Association of the University of Toronto\u201d.\nAppeal allowed with costs, CARTWRIGHT and JUDSON JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellant: McMaster, Steele, McKinnon, MacKenzie & Collins-Williams, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the respondent: E.S.

The evidence relied on by the Crown showed that the accused had been twice convicted of sexual offences against young girls, and included the opinion of two psychiatrists, whose opinion rested, in part, on material found in prison files and dealing with the accused\u2019s background and also on the accused\u2019s admissions to the psychiatrists. The appellant submitted that since the material in the prison files had not been proven in open Court and that the admissions made to the psychiatrists had not been proven to have been made voluntarily, both rules governing hearsay and confession evidence had been offended, with the result that the evidence of the two psychiatrists was inadmissible. The Court of Appeal affirmed the finding made by the trial judge as well as the sentence of preventive detention. The appellant was granted leave to appeal to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nAs to the confession rule. The rule of evidence governing the admissibility of statements made by a person charged with an offence has no application in the case of statements made by a sexual offender to psychiatrists conducting examinations in accordance with recognized normal psychiatric procedures, in order to assist the Court in proceedings under s. 661 of the Criminal Code. These proceedings do not involve the conviction of an offence, but the determination of the sentence which may be pronounced after conviction. The rule has not been established for proceedings related to the determination of a sentence. Furthermore, the position of the psychiatrists during the examination of an accused pursuant to s. 661(2) of the Code is not that of persons in authority but is that of free and independent medical experts.\nAs to the hearsay rule. In order to form an opinion according to recognized normal psychiatric procedures, the psychiatrist must consider all possible sources of information, including second-hand source information, the reliability, accuracy and significance of which are within the recognized scope of his professional activities, skill and training to evaluate. In the present case, the evidence indicated that the information gathered from the prison files was not considered by the two psychiatrists as having any real significance in the formation of their opinion which was grounded ultimately on the examinations of the appellant and on evidence given at the hearing of the application. In any event, the trial judge found that the relevant evidence before him, exclusive of that of the psychiatrists, was conclusive, and this finding was upheld by the Court of Appeal.\nDroit criminel\u2014D\u00e9linquant sexuel dangereux\u2014Sentence de d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive\u2014T\u00e9moignage de psychiatres\u2014Admissibilit\u00e9\u2014R\u00e8gle concernant la preuve par ou\u00ef-dire a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9e\u2014R\u00e8gle concernant la preuve d\u2019aveux a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9e\u2014Code criminel, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, arts. 659, 660, 661.\nLa Cour de premi\u00e8re instance a jug\u00e9 que l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait un d\u00e9linquant sexuel dangereux et l\u2019a condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 une sentence de d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive. La preuve sur laquelle la Couronne s\u2019est appuy\u00e9e montre que l\u2019accus\u00e9, \u00e0 deux occasions, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9 coupable d\u2019offenses sexuelles contre des fillettes, et comporte aussi l\u2019opinion de deux psychiatres reposant, en partie, sur des documents provenant des dossiers de prison et portant sur les ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents de l\u2019appelant et aussi sur des aveux faits par l\u2019appelant aux psychiatres. L\u2019appelant soutient que puisque les documents provenant des dossiers de la prison n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9s en Cour et que les aveux faits aux psychiatres n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 faits volontairement, les r\u00e8gles concernant la preuve par ou\u00ef-dire et la preuve par aveux avaient toutes deux \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9es, avec le r\u00e9sultat que le t\u00e9moignage des deux psychiatres n\u2019\u00e9tait pas admissible.

La r\u00e8gle de preuve gouvernant l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 de d\u00e9clarations faites par une personne accus\u00e9e d\u2019une offense ne s\u2019applique pas dans le cas de d\u00e9clarations faites par un d\u00e9linquant sexuel aux psychiatres \u00e0 l\u2019occasion d\u2019examens que ces derniers lui font subir selon les proc\u00e9dures psychiatriques normales et reconnues, en vue d\u2019aider la Cour dans les proc\u00e9dures en vertu de l\u2019art. 661 du Code criminel. Ces proc\u00e9dures n\u2019entra\u00eenent pas la condamnation pour une offense, mais la d\u00e9termination de la sentence qui doit \u00eatre prononc\u00e9e apr\u00e8s la condamnation.

De plus, la position des psychiatres durant l\u2019examen d\u2019un accus\u00e9 en vertu de l\u2019art. 661(2) du Code n\u2019est pas celle de personnes repr\u00e9sentant l\u2019autorit\u00e9 mais celle d\u2019experts m\u00e9dicaux libres et ind\u00e9pendants.\nEn ce qui regarde la r\u00e8gle concernant la preuve par ou\u00ef-dire. Pour se former une opinion selon les proc\u00e9dures psychiatriques normales et reconnues, le psychiatre doit prendre en consid\u00e9ration toute source possible d\u2019information, y compris une source de seconde main. Ses activit\u00e9s professionnelles, son art et son entra\u00eenement lui permettent d\u2019\u00e9valuer la v\u00e9racit\u00e9, l\u2019exactitude et la signification de ces informations. Dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, la preuve indique que les deux psychiatres n\u2019ont pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que les renseignements obtenus des dossiers de la prison avaient contribu\u00e9 d\u2019une fa\u00e7on significative \u00e0 la formation de leur opinion qui, en d\u00e9finitive, \u00e9tait bas\u00e9e sur l\u2019examen de l\u2019appelant et sur la preuve entendue lors de l\u2019audition de la demande en vertu de l\u2019art. 661 du Code. A tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, le juge au proc\u00e8s a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019opinion que la preuve pertinente devant lui, \u00e0 l\u2019exclusion de celle des psychiatres, \u00e9tait concluante, et cette opinion a \u00e9t\u00e9 partag\u00e9e par la Cour d\u2019appel.\nAPPEL d\u2019un jugement de la Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie-Britannique1, confirmant un verdict que l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait un d\u00e9linquant sexuel dangereux. Appel rejet\u00e9.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], affirming a finding that the appellant was a dangerous sexual offender. Appeal dismissed.\nT.G. Ison, for the appellant.\nW.G. Burke-Robertson, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nFAUTEUX J.:\u2014This is an appeal, brought by leave from a unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia1, affirming (i) a finding made by Munroe J., that the appellant is a dangerous sexual offender and (ii) the sentence imposed upon him as a sequence. At the conclusion of the hearing before us, the Court, indicating that reasons would be delivered later, dismissed the appeal.\nThe grounds of appeal which were raised, are related to the evidence which, so far as relevant to the principal and, indeed, only ground that needs to be dealt with, can be briefly stated. As indicated in the reasons for judgment of the trial Judge, the evidence relied on by the Crown at trial, shows that:\u2014on November 26, 1960, the appellant was convicted by a jury of an indecent assault committed the preceding month, upon a 12 year old girl and was sentenced to 2 years\u2019 imprisonment; on November 16, 1963, he was convicted by a jury of having had sexual intercourse, in May of the same year, again with a 12 year old girl, and was sentenced to 8 years\u2019 imprisonment; the appellant, a stranger to the victim of the last mentioned attack, forced her into his car and on the floor thereof, on the threat of killing her, and drove her to a secluded area where, by force, he removed her clothing and had sexual relations without her consent. The evidence relied on by the Crown also includes the opinion of two experienced and well-qualified psychiatrists, namely Dr. J.C. Thomas and Dr. R.C. Whitman. Both called by the Crown, they testified, in chief, that, as a result of their personal and separately conducted examination of the appellant at the B.C. Penitentiary and of the evidence they heard at trial, they formed the opinion that the appellant was a person who, by his conduct, in any sexual matter, has shown his failure to control his sexual impulses, that he is likely to cause injury, pain or other evil to any person through failure in the future to control his sexual impulses, and that he is likely to commit further sexual offences. Counsel for the appellant, having then asked for and obtained permission to cross-examine the psychiatrists as to their conversations with the appellant, thereby elicited that the latter had thought of killing the victim of the last mentioned offence in order to destroy her evidence and that he had had similar, though undetected, experiences with other young girls, his nieces. Appellant\u2019s counsel also elicited from the doctors that, for the purpose of obtaining background information upon the appellant and his family, they had examined prison files containing, amongst other material, a psychiatric report made earlier by another psychiatrist, the results of a psychological test, a classification report, an Alberta hospital report and that such material was taken into account in reaching their conclusion which, in essence, however, was based on their examination of the appellant and the evidence given at the hearing.\nThe appellant did not testify, nor was any defence evidence called on his behalf.\nAppellant\u2019s counsel submitted, at trial, that since the opinion of the psychiatrists rested, in part, on the above material found in prison files and not proved in open court and also on appellant\u2019s admissions or confessions to the psychiatrists, not proved to have been made voluntarily, both rules governing hearsay and confession evidence were offended with the consequence that the evidence of the two doctors was not only worthless but wholly inadmissible.\nThe trial Judge did not find it necessary to decide whether the hearsay rule had been offended. He noted that Dr. Thomas had stated that such reports were used to save time, were of no significance and merely confirmed his own finding reached independently thereof and that Dr. Whitman had testified that while such reports were helpful, his opinion, based only on his interview with the appellant and the evidence he had heard in court, would nevertheless be the same. Finally, the trial Judge found that the relevant evidence before him, exclusive of that of the psychiatrists, was conclusive.\nThe contention that there had been a breach of the rule governing confession, was rejected. The trial Judge referred to Regina v. Leggo[2] and quoted the following part of a statement made by Norris J.A., at page 407:\n\u2026the psychiatrists were entitled to rely on statements made by the appellant to them, in forming their opinions\u2026\nIn the Court of Appeal[3], the appellant\u2019s submission with respect to the admissibility of the psychiatrists\u2019 evidence was also, and unanimously, rejected. The Court decided that there was no obligation for the Crown to prove the voluntariness of the admissions or confessions made by the appellant to the doctors, for the reason that the proceedings under s. 661 of the Criminal Code do not involve the conviction of a crime, but are held for the purpose of deciding whether a sentence of preventive detention should be substituted for the sentence pronounced on the substantive offence.\nThe Court of Appeal, like the trial Judge, did not find it necessary to decide whether the examination of the material found in the prison files offended the hearsay rule. The Court was satisfied from the evidence that this examination did not greatly influence either doctors who based their opinion mainly on the examination of the appellant and the evidence given at the hearing. Finally, the Court relied on the fact that the trial Judge had expressly stated, in his reasons for judgment, that, exclusive of such material, he would have reached the same view. Hence, the dismissal of the appeal.\nDealing at first with the applicability of the confession rule:\u2014There are cogent reasons to hold, as did the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, in this case, and the Courts of Appeal for Manitoba and Alberta, respectively, in Regina v. Johnston[4] and Regina v. McKenzie[5], that the rule of evidence governing the admissibility of statements made by a person charged with an offence has no application in the case of statements made by a sexual offender to psychiatrists conducting examinations in accordance with recognized normal psychiatric procedures, in order to assist the Court in proceedings under s. 661 of the Criminal Code.\nOne of the reasons flows from the very nature of the issue involved in these proceedings. The issue, in these proceedings which can only be resorted to if the accused has been convicted of a sexual offence, is not whether he should be convicted of another offence, but solely whether he is afflicted by a state or condition that makes him a dangerous sexual offender within the meaning of s. 659(b) of the Criminal Code. To be so afflicted is not an offence. As to this aspect of the matter, the line of reasoning adopted by the Court of Criminal Appeal in the King v. Hunter[6] and this Court in Brusch v. The Queen[7], holding that a charge of being a habitual criminal is not a charge of an offence but merely the assertion of a status or condition, applies here on a charge of being a dangerous sexual offender. Indeed, a reference to subs. 3 of s. 661 of the Criminal Code makes it clear that the object sought by Parliament, in enacting these special provisions, is not to create an offence but to enable the Court, in cases where a sexual offender is found to be a dangerous sexual offender, to pass upon him a further sentence in lieu of or in addition to the sentence passed or which could have been passed for the sexual offence of which he was convicted. These proceedings do not involve the conviction of an offence, but the determination of the sentence which may be pronounced after conviction. The confession rule, which excludes incriminatory statements not affirmatively proved to have been made voluntarily, is a rule which has been designed for proceedings where, broadly speaking, the guilt or innocence of a person charged with an offence is the matter in issue. The rule has not been established for proceedings related to the determination of a sentence. I know of no binding authority holding that its application extends, and can think of no valid reason why it should be held to extend to examinations conducted by psychiatrists, in compliance with subs. 2 of s. 661 of the Criminal Code, in order that they could form and subsequently convey to the Court an opinion as to the mental state or condition of a sexual offender.\nAnother reason why the confession rule does not obtain to exclude statements made by a sexual offender to psychiatrists examining him pursuant to subs. 2 of s. 661 of the Code, is that the latter are not, as it has been decided particularly by the Court of Appeal for Alberta in Regina v. McKenzie, supra, persons in authority. Indeed, the nature of their position, in relation to the proceedings under s. 661 of the Code, does not enable them to control or influence the course of such proceedings in the sense and the manner in which the course of proceedings may be controlled or influenced by persons who have a concern with the apprehension, prosecution or examination of prisoners conducted to collect evidence leading to the conviction of an offence. On the contrary, and as the purpose to be inferred from subs. 2 of s. 661 of the Code indicates, the position of the psychiatrists, in relation to the proceedings under s. 661, is that of free and independent medical experts, specialists in mental health, whose only part and concern in the proceedings is to give to the Court the assistance, which the latter is required by subs. 2 to seek from them, for the assessment of the mental state or condition of a sexual offender and the determination of the application made under the section. Except in rare cases, where indications to the contrary might possibly appear,\u2014and none have been shown in this case\u2014psychiatrists called to assist the Court in these proceedings cannot be considered as being persons in authority. In this respect, their position, in relation to proceedings under s. 661 of the Code, does not differ from their position in relation to proceedings where insanity is raised as an issue, and never, as far as I know, was it suggested that, in the latter case, they have the status of persons in authority.\nDealing with hearsay:\u2014The evidence, in this case, indicates that to form an opinion according to recognized normal psychiatric procedures, the psychiatrist must consider all possible sources of information, including second-hand source information, the reliability, accuracy and significance of which are within the recognized scope of his professional activities, skill and training to evaluate. Hence, while ultimately his conclusion may rest, in part, on second-hand source material, it is nonetheless an opinion formed according to recognized normal psychiatric procedures. It is not to be assumed that Parliament contemplated that the opinion, which the psychiatrists would form and give to assist the Court, would be formed by methods other than those recognized in normal psychiatric procedures. The value of a psychiatrist\u2019s opinion may be affected to the extent to which it may rest on second-hand source material; but that goes to the weight and not to the receivability in evidence of the opinion, which opinion is no evidence of the truth of the information but evidence of the opinion formed on the basis of that information. I find it unnecessary, in this case, to pursue these considerations which, I think, would generally obtain in proceedings under s. 661 of the Code, where the hearing and determination of the application are entrusted to a judge alone. In the present case, the information gathered from prison files was not considered by the two psychiatrists as having any real significance in the formation of their opinion which was grounded ultimately on the examinations of the appellant and the evidence given at the hearing of the application. And, in any event, the trial Judge found, as he was entitled to after considering all the evidence, that, exclusive of the evidence of the psychiatrists, the relevant evidence before him was conclusive.\nIn these circumstances, the present appeal could not be allowed and was, as above indicated, dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: T.G.

The appellant, who was engaged on a monthly fee basis by the vendors, represented also the purchaser O in a transaction in respect of the sale of a motel. The evidence was that the appellant had failed to disclose to O the existence of an outstanding second mortgage on the property. The Crown contended that this failure constituted fraud within the meaning of s. 323(1) of the Code. The accused admitted that he knew of this second mortgage but that his failure to inform the purchaser was due to inadvertence on his part and without any intent to defraud. It was conceded that the accused did not personally profit from the alleged fraud. In his charge to the jury, the trial judge said that the evidence, if believed, was that a false statement had been made by the accused to the purchaser. An appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed. The accused was granted leave to appeal to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed, the conviction quashed and the appellant acquitted. The trial judge\u2019s charge amounted to misdirection. The Crown\u2019s case against the appellant was not that he had given false information but that he had fraudulently withheld material information from O, a situation essentially different in character from that put to the jury by the trial judge. It was not possible to say that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice had occurred by reason of this misdirection.\nDroit criminel\u2014Fraude\u2014Op\u00e9ration immobili\u00e8re\u2014Avocat du vendeur agissant aussi pour l\u2019acheteur\u2014Existence d\u2019une seconde hypoth\u00e8que non d\u00e9voil\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019acheteur\u2014La cause a\u2011t\u2011elle \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise correctement au jury\u2014Code criminel, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, art. 323(1).\nL\u2019appelant, un avocat, a \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9 coupable par un jury d\u2019avoir frustr\u00e9 O par supercherie, mensonge ou autres moyens dolosifs, le tout contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019art. 323(1) du Code criminel. L\u2019appelant, qui touchait des honoraires mensuels du vendeur, a repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aussi l\u2019acheteur O lors d\u2019une op\u00e9ration immobili\u00e8re concernant la vente d\u2019un motel.

L\u2019appelant a admis qu\u2019il \u00e9tait au courant de la seconde hypoth\u00e8que mais que son d\u00e9faut d\u2019en informer l\u2019acheteur \u00e9tait d\u00fb \u00e0 une inadvertance de sa part et sans aucune intention de frustrer. Il est admis que l\u2019appelant n\u2019a retir\u00e9 personnellement aucun profit de la fraude all\u00e9gu\u00e9e.

Appel maintenu.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, affirming a conviction for fraud. Appeal allowed.\nNo one appearing for the appellant.\nW.G. Burke-Robertson, Q.C., for the respondent. The judgment of the Court was delivered by\nHALL J.:\u2014The appellant was tried jointly with one Arthur Bennett by a judge and jury in the month of January 1963 at Vancouver in the Province of British Columbia upon three counts as follows:\n1. That at the City of Vancouver, in the County and Province aforesaid, between the 1st day of January, A.D. 1959, and the 30th day of March, A.D. 1959, they, the said ARTHUR BENNETT and JOHN MacKROW, together with HYCREST HOLDINGS LIMITED and HYCREST MOTELS LIMITED by deceit, falsehood, or other fraudulent means, did defraud SAMUEL NORWOLL of property, money or valuable security, contrary to the form of the statute in such case made and provided and against the peace of our Lady the Queen, her Crown and Dignity.\n2. That at the City of Vancouver, in the County and Province aforesaid and at the City of New Westminster, in the Province aforesaid, between the first day of May, A.D. 1959, and the 30th day of June, A.D. 1959, they, the said ARTHUR BENNETT and JOHN MacKROW, together with HYCREST INVESTMENTS LIMITED, IDEAL MOTELS LIMITED and HYCREST MOTELS LIMITED by deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent means, did defraud JAMES JACK ORAN of property, money or valuable security, contrary to the form of the statute in such case made and provided and against the peace of our Lady the Queen, her Crown and Dignity.\n3. That at the City of Vancouver, in the County and Province aforesaid, between the 1st day of May, A.D. 1959, and the 30th day of June, A.D. 1959, he the said JOHN MacKROW, being a trustee of money for the use and benefit of JAMES JACK ORAN did convert, with intent to defraud and in violation of his trust, the said money or a part of it to a use that was not authorized by the trust, contrary to the form of statute in such case made and provided and against the peace of our Lady the Queen, her Crown and Dignity.\n\u201cAmended\n15.1.63\nA.B.C.\u201d\nThe jury acquitted MacKrow on Count 1, but convicted him on Counts 2 and 3. Bennett was convicted on Counts 1 and 2. MacKrow was sentenced by Mr. Justice Ruttan, the trial judge, to serve a term of five years in the penitentiary on each of Counts 2 and 3, the sentences to be served concurrently. He appealed to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia which, on October 17, 1963, dismissed the appeal as to Count 2 but quashed the conviction on Count 3. Accordingly, Count 2 in respect of MacKrow only is the one issue now before the Court. The Court of Appeal did not disturb the five years\u2019 sentence when it dismissed the appeal in respect of Count 2. MacKrow was a prisoner in the penitentiary until paroled on July 8, 1965. Shortly after his release from the penitentiary, MacKrow applied to this Court for an order extending the time within which to make application for leave to appeal and for an order granting leave to appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal pronounced on the 17th day of October, 1963. This application was dealt with on December 8, 1965, when the following order was made:\nTHIS COURT DID ORDER AND ADJUDGE that the time for applying for leave to appeal to this Court be and the same was extended to the 8th day of December, 1965.\nAND THIS COURT DID FURTHER ORDER AND ADJUDGE that leave to appeal from the Judgment of the Court of Appeal for the Province of British Columbia pronounced on the 17th day of October, 1963 be and the same was granted on the following questions of law, namely:\n\u201c(1) Did the Court of Appeal err in holding that there was evidence upon which the jury could reasonably convict the appellant on Count No. 2 of the indictment.\n(2) Did the Court of Appeal for British Columbia err in holding that any defence which was available to the accused was properly and adequately put by the learned trial judge in view of the appellant\u2019s contention that:\n(a) The learned trial judge instructed the jury that there was evidence on the part of the witness Oran that a false statement was made to him at the time specified in the said Count No. 2 whereas there was no such evidence;\n(b) The learned trial judge instructed the jury that it was not challenged that the appellant had given false information to Oran whereas it was a part of the appellant\u2019s defence that he had not done so;\n(c) The learned trial judge instructed the jury that the appellant\u2019s sole defence was that he had been negligent whereas it was part of his defence that he had given no false information.\u201d\nThe substantive question argued on the hearing of the appeal was whether the learned trial judge had erred in his direction to the jury in respect of the law and evidence relating to Count 2. MacKrow was not present on the hearing of the appeal nor was he represented by counsel. However, he did file a factum and a memorandum in reply to the respondent\u2019s factum pursuant to leave granted by the Chief Justice of this Court. Mr. Burke-Robertson, Q.C., appeared for the Crown and developed the evidence and points in issue with scrupulous fairness to the Crown and to the appellant.\nWhile the Crown was within its rights in including Counts 1 and 2 in the one indictment, the fact that the two counts were proceeded with in the one indictment did make for a very long and complicated trial (over three weeks) in which it was difficult to keep separate the evidence relating to Count 1 from that relating to Counts 2 and 3, particularly as the wheelings and dealings of Bennett and the corporate manipulations and financial difficulties of his companies, Hycrest Holdings Limited and Hycrest Motels Limited, named in Count 1, were involved in both Counts 1 and 2 and the same corporate manipulations and difficulties of these companies and of a third company, Ideal Motels Limited, named in Count 2, were also involved in respect of Count 2 as well as those of a fourth company, Pacific American Motels Limited, not named in the count. The offence charged in Count 2 was alleged to have taken place, according to the evidence, on or about the 15th day of May, 1959. The evidence shows that the appellant was arrested on the charge on January 5, 1962, and that in the interval civil litigation over the transactions in question had taken place resulting in James Jack Oran, the man named in Counts 2 and 3 recovering judgment against Bennett and MacKrow in an amount of approximately $5,000 and costs. I mention this because in the address of Mr. Mussallem, who was counsel for MacKrow at the trial, he made reference to this lapse of time. He was interrupted by Ruttan J. and directed to go no further with that submission as follows:\nTHE COURT: But you are criticizing the Crown for not bringing the case earlier which, I think, is in fact criticism, and I ask you not to go ahead with it.\nConsidered alone, perhaps nothing substantial turns on this point although it is related to the question as to whether any defence which was available to the appellant was properly and adequately put to the jury by the learned trial judge. The fact that criminal proceedings were not instituted for some 32 months after the alleged offence is said to have been committed and then only after civil proceedings had been taken and a judgment for some $5,000 obtained which was unsatisfied when the charge was laid, was in my view, a proper matter for comment when the issue was, as in this case, one relating to whether or not a person has been defrauded by deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent means. Criminal proceedings brought long after the event complained of and following civil proceedings that result in an unsatisfied judgment without any explanation for the delay may well be looked upon with some suspicion by a jury where the issue is financial loss arising out of a commercial transaction.\nThe basic facts upon which Counts 2 and 3 are based are that on or about the 15th day of May, 1959, the person named in Counts 2 and 3, the said James Jack Oran, had answered an advertisement in a Saskatchewan paper relating to a motel which was for sale at White Rock, British Columbia. He called at the Hycrest office in Vancouver on May 12, 1959, and saw a Mrs. Young and Bennett. Following a discussion with these parties, he decided to purchase the property. He signed a document (Exhibit 48) which is headed \u201cOffer for Purchase, Acceptance and Interim Receipt\u201d, the vendor being Pacific American Motels Limited. The purchase price was stated to be $47,500 payable $18,000 cash and an Agreement for Sale for the balance, $29,500 payable over 15 years with interest at 6 per cent. He made a deposit of $1,000. He was told at this time that there was a mortgage in favour of Associated Investors Limited against the property for $12,000 payable at $225 per month. The offer was submitted to Pacific American Motels Limited. Two days later he was communicated with, and following a discussion, agreed to increasing the interest rate to 7 per cent. He was then brought to MacKrow\u2019s office which was in the office of Hycrest Investments Limited, a motel on Denman Street in Vancouver. MacKrow, who had been called to the Bar May 1, 1954, was engaged principally in doing work for Bennett and his companies on a $1,200 a month fee basis. This was the first time Oran had met MacKrow. In so far as going to MacKrow, Oran testified:\nA. I did say to Mrs. Young if I decide to buy this property I will have to get a lawyer to draw up the transactions.\nQ. Yes.\nA. And she says, \u201cWell, we have a lawyer working with us, Mr. MacKrow, and that would be the most convenient, to have him do the work.\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, he works for your company. Probably I should still get a lawyer, some other lawyer.\u201d And she was very emphatic, she said that it will cost more to get some other lawyer, it will take more time, and besides MacKrow, he does this work every day, it will be quicker, and the effect of what she said was that it would be quicker and cheaper and it would be the best to have MacKrow do the work. As a result of her suggestion I did engage MacKrow.\nThen, in connection with the actual Agreement for Sale which was prepared by MacKrow, Oran said that some two days later he got a call to come to MacKrow\u2019s office. This is when the Agreement for Sale (Exhibit 51) was prepared and signed. Respecting the agreement, Mr. Oran testified:\nMR. COLTHURST:\nQ. Who produced the agreement for sale, Mr. Oran?\nA. MacKrow did.\nQ. And what, if any, discussion took place about the document?\nA. Well, I read over the first page terms.\nQ. Yes?\nA. And we agreed verbally with the terms, the full amount $47,500.00, the down payment $18,000.00, of which I had already paid $1,000.00.\nQ. Yes?\nA. And the monthly payments $263.51.\nQ. Yes?\nA. And there was a 15-year basis we agreed verbally.\nQ. Let me see that. Do you recall any further discussion in connection with that agreement for sale?\nA. Yes, I particularly noticed the Associated Investors mortgage.\nQ. And that is the mortgage that is referred to on the first page of that document, is it?\nA. That is right.\nQ. Where it says subject to a mortgage in favour of Associated Investors Limited, registered in the Land Registry office under No. 238252C, which the vendors herein covenant to pay according to the terms thereof?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And save harmless the purchasers therefrom provided that should the vendors default in the payment of any monies due under the said mortgage the purchaser may make payment of such monies to the said mortgagee and the vendors shall allow the purchaser full credit hereunder to the amount of such payment.\nA. That is what I am referring to, yes.\nQ. And was there any discussion in that connection?\nA. Well, we discussed the amount of the mortgage and the standing and he said that is the mortgage that was on the listing. It is approximately $12,000.00.\nQ. And when you say \u201che\u201d, who was \u201che\u201d?\nA. MacKrow.\nQ. Yes. He said that is it. I am sorry, you have already told us what he said. Yes, and what else?\nA. That is the mortgage in good standing, it is being paid off at $225.00 a month. Q. Yes.\nA. I think there was another ten years to go. So I did say, \u201cWell, couldn\u2019t I pay that directly to Associated Investors?\u201d Well, he said it really didn\u2019t matter. The effect of what he said was that it didn\u2019t matter, the difference between $12,000.00 and the agreement for sale was $29,500.00, and this particular mortgage is only $12,000.00 so even if the vendor did default in the payments that I still had there was still $17,000.00 left. So it really didn\u2019t matter, he said.\nQ. And did you look at any other portion of that agreement for sale?\nA. Well, I went over all of it and they said, I probably didn\u2019t read all of the second page. MacKrow said, \u201cWell, that is the usual form,\u201d and he emphasized paid in 15 years, I will get a clear title, and that is all I asked to have the agreement for sale be what it is.\nQ. And as far as looking now at the second page of that agreement you say that you, as I recall the effect of what you said, was you probably didn\u2019t read it all. Did you read any of it or notice any of it?\nA. Well, I probably didn\u2019t read it all, but I noticed there were, this blank space.\nQ. Yes?\nA. And I think we discussed that. MacKrow mentioned that if there were any changes or alterations it would be here. But this is the usual blank space, the usual form that is used and I felt that that was good enough.\nQ. And you are referring to what blank space? Just hold it up and show?\nA. This one here.\nQ. That is the blank space where again?\nA. Right here.\nQ. Where there is certain typewritten words, is that right?\nA. Yes.\nQ. The typewritten words being what?\nA. No exceptions.\nAfter signing the agreement, Oran made out two cheques totalling $17,060.18 payable to MacKrow. Oran then left and did not see or speak to MacKrow again until some months later. Meanwhile, MacKrow proceeded to have the agreement registered and in due course, on June 2, 1959, wrote Oran at White Rock, British Columbia, as follows:\nDear Sir: Re sale to you of Ideal Motel, White Rock.\nThe registration of the above-mentioned sale has now been completed and I enclose herewith your copy of the agreement for sale, which was registered in the New Westminster Land Registry Office under No. 261951C. Also is enclosed a copy of the statement of adjustments for your records. He enclosed a statement of adjustments as follows:\nPurchaser\u2019s Statement of Adjustments adjusted as of May 16, 1959\nRe: Purchase of Ideal Motel, White Rock, B.C.\nTo: Purchase Price....................................................\n$ 47,500.00\nBy: Agreement for Sale.............................................\n$ 29,500.00\nBy: Deposit.................................................................\n1,000.00\nTo: Insurance at $404.00 for 3 yrs. unexpired portion 2 yrs.................................................................................\n268.40\nBy: Taxes\u2014Vendor\u2019s share 4\u00bd mos. @ $677.71..\n254.11\nBy: Vendor\u2019s share sewer tax\u2014$62.00 4\u00bd mos....\n23.31\nBy: Plexolite Sign.......................................................\n5.20\nTo: Registration of Agree. for Sale...........................\n24.00\nTo: Legal Fees...........................................................\n40.00\nBy: Balance due from you..........................................\n17,060.18\n$ 47,837.60\n$ 47,837.60\nAs stated previously, Oran was advised of the mortgage in favour of Associated Investors Limited before he saw MacKrow. The charge against MacKrow was that in addition to the Associated Investors\u2019 mortgage there was also registered against the title to the property which Oran was buying a second mortgage given by Ideal Motels Limited to Issie Feldstein dated September 19, 1958, for the sum of $12,000 payable on or before March 25, 1959. Oran was not advised of the existence of this mortgage when he signed the offer to purchase (Exhibit 48) and did not learn of it until, in the month of September 1959, he had a call from Feldstein advising him of the mortgage and demanding payment and threatening foreclosure as the mortgage was then overdue. He immediately got in touch with MacKrow who he says assured him the matter would be taken care of. MacKrow communicated with Bennett who, after some delay and because neither he nor Hycrest Motels Limited were able to pay off the Feldstein mortgage, arranged along with solicitors for Oran to have Credit Foncier Franco\u2011Canadien take title and pay off the two mortgages. This left Oran to settle with Credit Foncier but the transaction resulted in an actual loss of $2,507.80 to Oran. The motel cost him that much more than he had agreed to pay for it in the first place. This loss was part of the unsatisfied judgment previously mentioned which he subsequently recovered against MacKrow and Bennett. The Crown alleged that MacKrow had knowledge of the existence of the Feldstein mortgage on May 15, 1959, both from the fact that he had prepared the mortgage in the first place in September 1958 and from the fact that he participated in a meeting on April 8, 1959, at which a document (Exhibit 35) was prepared by him and which dealt specifically with the Feldstein mortgage. Exhibit 35 reads as follows:\nVancouver, B.C.\nApril 8, 1959.\nHycrest Motels Ltd.,\n1120 Denman St.,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sirs:\nRe: Transfer to us of El Rancho\nColumbia, Fairlane, Triway\nMotels.\nThis is to confirm our agreement with you made this date with reference to the above transfer of motel properties, as follows:\u2014\n1. We are to have full possession and title to the above motels, together with all shares in companies owning any of the said properties.\n2. All adjustments between us with reference to the said transfers are to be taken as settled by the transfer to us of all shares in the company known as Ideal Motels Ltd., and by the transfer to us of the property known as Buena Vista Motel, White Rock, B.C. You agree to discharge at your expense \u201cby April 26, 1959\u201d the mortgage now on the Ideal Motel property in the approximate amount of $13,800.00 held by one Issie Feldstein.\n3. A full mutual release is to be executed by both you and us.\nYours very truly,\nPacific American Motel Corp. Ltd.\nPer: \u201cE.W. Ormheim\u201d\nPer: \u201cJ.W. Ambler\u201d\n\u201cEWO\u201d\n\u201cJPM\u201d\nThe Crown says that MacKrow\u2019s failure to bring to Oran\u2019s attention the fact of the existence on May 15, 1959, of the Feldstein mortgage was fraud within the meaning of s. 323(1) of the Criminal Code. There is no evidence that MacKrow said in so many words that the property was subject only to the Associated Investors\u2019 mortgage or that there was only one mortgage. Rather he inserted a clause in the Agreement for Sale (Exhibit 51) to safeguard Oran in respect of the Associated Investors\u2019 mortgage only of which Oran had knowledge. The Crown\u2019s position is that MacKrow\u2019s silence and failure to make known the existence of the Feldstein mortgage to Oran at that time was fraud on his part. MacKrow, while admitting that he knew of the Feldstein mortgage in September 1958 and that it was still unpaid as of April 8, 1959, said that his failure to inform Oran of it was due to inadvertence on his part, and while admitting negligence as a solicitor in failing to have a search made of the title which would have shown the mortgage still on the title, he insisted that it had been done innocently and in a hurry and without any intent to defraud. The issue, therefore, which the jury had to decide was whether the Crown had made out its case of fraud against MacKrow beyond a reasonable doubt.\nThe burden of proof was on the Crown to establish the fraud. It relied strongly on Exhibit 35 quoted above, but it must be noted that this exhibit specifically contained the statement that the Feldstein mortgage was to be discharged by April 26, 1959. There was no direct evidence that the appellant knew that this had not been done when he dealt with. Oran on May 15. The jury was asked to conclude that because this mortgage was registered against the property to MacKrow\u2019s knowledge in April that it was necessarily fraud on his part when he failed to communicate that fact to Oran on May 15 even though the document (Exhibit 35) relied on so strongly by the Crown itself provided for the mortgage being off the title by April 26. Much stress was placed by the Crown on a document (Exhibit 56) dated May 22, 1959, signed by one Ellen M. Rodgers, MacKrow\u2019s secretary, which accompanied the Agreement for Sale when it was tendered for registration in the Land Registry Office on May 27, 1959. This document in which Rodgers said she was the authorized agent of Oran stated that the Agreement for Sale was being registered subject to both mortgages and listed the registered numbers of the two mortgages. According to this witness, these numbers may have been typed in after the document was prepared between May 22 and May 27, 1959. Obviously by May 27, 1959, some one in MacKrow\u2019s office was or became aware that the Feldstein mortgage was still on the title because its registered number was inserted at or prior to the time the Agreement for Sale was being tendered for registration. MacKrow denied having prepared the document and there was no evidence of the source from which the witness Rodgers got the number of the Feldstein mortgage if, in fact, she was the one who actually typed in the number. She did not identify MacKrow as the source from which she got the number.\nThis summarizes the evidence relied on by the Crown to bridge the gap between the time the Feldstein mortgage should have been discharged according to Exhibit 35 and May 15 and upon which the Crown argued that the jury must infer that MacKrow knew the mortgage had not been discharged as of May 15 and that he fraudulently withheld that fact from Oran in order to get the $17,000 cash for his principal client Bennett. It was conceded that MacKrow did not personally profit from the alleged fraud.\nThis was the case which MacKrow had to answer. The defences open to him on the evidence included (1) the contention that he had made no false or any statement to Oran respecting the Feldstein mortgage and (2) that his failure to tell Oran of the Feldstein mortgage was due to inadvertence and was not deliberate or intended to mislead or defraud Oran. Ruttan J. put the case to the jury as follows:\nNow on the other hand in the second count, in the Oran count, there is, I suggest to you, no evidence of a promise to do something in the future. The evidence, if you accept it, on the part of Oran is that a false statement was made to him at that time. In fact, I do not think it is challenged that he was given false information. The defence is that it was by negligence, by inadvertence, but I do not think it is disputed that he was given false information, the false statement being once again, that there was only one encumbrance on the property when, in fact, there was a second encumbrance, once again a mortgage in the name of Issie Feldstein which was never revealed to Oran until Feldstein himself called him up some months later to warn him that he was going to foreclose.\n(The italics are my own.)\nIn my view this was misdirection. The case against the appellant was not that he had given false information but that he had fraudulently withheld material information from Oran in order to obtain the money which Oran paid to him on May 15, a situation essentially different in character from that put to the jury in the quotation set out above. See Regina v. Charters[1].\nI am unable to say that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred by reason of this misdirection. It follows that the conviction against the appellant on Count 2 cannot stand. There remains the question as to whether a new trial should be ordered. Crown counsel did not ask for a new trial in the event that the conviction was set aside. The conviction will, accordingly, be quashed and MacKrow acquitted on Count 2. His previous acquittals on Counts 1 and 3 completely dispose of the charges against him.\nAppeal allowed, conviction quashed and appellant acquitted.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Boyd, King & Toy, Vancouver.\n[1] (1957), 119 C.C.C. 223.\n"}

The company disputed this and on this issue the parties went to arbitration under art. VIII of the agreement. The union was successful in getting a declaration favourable to the interpretation which would give the employees their money, but the arbitration board did not state in its reasons how much each was entitled to because they were not parties to the grievance procedure under art. VIII.\nThe employees then sued in the Division Court for their unpaid guaranteed pay and were met with the defence that they had no remedy because they had not followed art. VI grievance procedure. The company submitted that if each employee had presented a grievance under art. VI within the specified time limits, they would have secured declarations that they were entitled to specific sums of money. Having secured these declarations, they could have filed them with the Supreme Court under s. 34(9) of The Labour Relations Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 202, and then they would have had a judgment instead of what they presently had\u2014useless declarations of right. The company further submitted that because the employees might have followed the grievance procedure under art. VI, secured these declarations and filed them as judgments, there was no jurisdiction in any court to consider the matter.\nThe Division Court judge and the Court of Appeal having rejected the company\u2019s contention, an appeal, with leave, was brought to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe collective agreement was not concerned with the non-payment of wages. These could be sued for in the ordinary courts. If, however, the right to be paid depended upon the interpretation of the collective agreement, this was within the exclusive jurisdiction of a board of arbitration appointed under the agreement, but whether this decision came under grievance procedure under art. VI, with the consequent registration of the equivalent of a judgment or a declaration at the instance of the union under art. VIII, made no difference. In the one case the individual employees got the equivalent of judgments; in the other case, they had declarations of right on which they could sue.\nWhere wages were concerned, if the employee let the specified time limit go by before he filed a grievance, the union could still pursue the matter under art. VIII as it did here.\nRe Grottoli v. Lock & Son.

Written reasons were to be given later.\nThe dispute is over the pay that a spare operator is guaranteed under the collective agreement between the union and the street railway during each regular fourteen-day period. The union says that if the spare operator works at all during this period, he is guaranteed a minimum of seventy hours\u2019 pay. The company disputes this and on this issue the parties went to arbitration under art. VIII of the agreement.\nThe union secured a decision favourable to the spare operators that they were entitled to their seventy hours\u2019 pay. The majority decision of the Board also held that the union was entitled to pursue its complaint under art. VIII of the agreement.\nThe company now says, and it has said throughout, that this procedure was wrong or if it is not wrong it is of no use to the employees because they cannot do anything with a mere declaration of entitlement. It says that each employee should have presented a grievance under art. VI dealing with grievance procedure. If they had followed this procedure within the time limits specified in the agreement, they would have secured declarations that they were entitled to specific sums of money. Having secured these declarations, they could have filed them with the Supreme Court under s. 34(9) of The Labour Relations Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 202, and then they would have had a judgment instead of what they have now\u2014useless declarations of right. The company further says that because the employees might have followed the grievance procedure under art. VI, secured these declarations and filed them as judgments, there is no jurisdiction in any court to consider the matter. The result, therefore, is a procedural dilemma.\nThe union has been successful in getting the declaration favourable to the interpretation which would give the employees their money, but the arbitration board did not state in its reasons how much each was entitled to because they were not parties to the grievance procedure under art. VIII. The employees\u2019 next step was to sue in the Division Court for their unpaid guaranteed pay. They were met with the defence that they had no remedy because they had not followed art. VI grievance procedure.\nBoth the Division Court judge and the Court of Appeal have rejected this contention. These men have a point conclusively settled in their favour by the arbitration board. They can go before a court and say, \u201cWe are entitled to this money. All that remains is a mere matter of calculation. These are the hours for which we are entitled to be paid\u2014seventy hours minus whatever hours we were paid for and which we actually worked.\u201d\nThis is all that has happened and, in my opinion, the courts have jurisdiction to determine this matter. This was the precise point decided by McRuer C.J., in Re Grottoli v. Lock & Son Ltd.[1]\nIf one follows the company\u2019s argument to its ultimate conclusion it means that no employee can ever sue for wages unpaid. He would have to follow the grievance procedure in the collective agreement and be bound by very stringent time limits. This would be so even though there is no dispute about the wages being due and owing. The collective agreement is not concerned with non-payment of wages. These may be sued for in the ordinary courts. If, however, the right to be paid depends upon the interpretation of the collective agreement, this is within the exclusive jurisdiction of a board of arbitration appointed under the agreement, but whether this decision comes under grievance procedure under art. VI, with the consequent registration of the equivalent of a judgment or a declaration at the instance of the union under art. VIII, makes no difference. In the one case the individual employees get the equivalent of judgments; in the other case, they have declarations of right on which they can sue.\nI would go further and say that where wages are concerned, if the employee lets the six days go by before he files a grievance, the union can still pursue the matter under art. VIII as it did here.\nThe Rights of Labour Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 354, has nothing to do with this case. Section 3(3) provides:\n3.(3) A collective bargaining agreement shall not be the subject of any action in any court unless it may be the subject of such action irrespective of any of the provisions of this Act or of The Labour Relations Act.\nThe citation of a conclusive arbitration award under a collective bargaining agreement as the foundation for a claim for wages is not the same thing as making the collective agreement the subject of any action in any court.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Mathews, Dinsdale & Clark, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: White, Paikin, Foreman & Grannum, Hamilton.\n[1] [1963] 2 O.R. 254, 39 D.L.R.

The other two persons had obtained a farmout agreement from Imperial Oil Ltd., which they had assigned to the company for 1,000 shares and a royalty. Four wells were to be drilled, and when the agreement with the appellant and his associate was made, three wells remained to be drilled and financed. Pursuant to the agreement, the shares were divided so that each of the four associates held a quarter interest, and the royalty was similarly divided. In return, the appellant and his associate agreed to guarantee the company\u2019s indebtedness to the bank up to a maximum of $62,500 each. The consideration received by the appellant (the shares and the royalty) was taxed in 1951 as income and valued by the Minister at $4,500.\nIn 1957, the appellant had to pay $62,500 to the bank in discharge of his guarantee. He subsequently recovered as a creditor of the company\u2019s bankruptcy $6,119 in 1959 and $3,200 in 1961. The appellant sought to deduct his $62,500 loss from his income. The Minister refused to allow the deduction. The Exchequer Court reversed the decision of the Income Tax Appeal Board and allowed the deduction. The Minister appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed. The transaction entered into by the appellant was a deferred loan to the company, part of which was recovered in the bankruptcy. The loss suffered by the appellant was a loss of capital, the deduction of which was prohibited by s. 12(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act.\nRevenu\u2014Imp\u00f4t sur le revenu\u2014Montant pay\u00e9 par contribuable en garantie d\u2019un emprunt de banque\u2014Perte de capital ou d\u00e9pense d\u00e9ductible\u2014Loi de l\u2019Imp\u00f4t sur le Revenu, S.R.C. 1952, c. 148, arts. 8, 4, 12(1)(a), (b).\nEn 1951, l\u2019appelant et un associ\u00e9 ont pass\u00e9 un contrat avec deux autres personnes pour acqu\u00e9rir un int\u00e9r\u00eat dans une compagnie p\u00e9trolif\u00e8re.

Elles avaient assign\u00e9 ce droit \u00e0 la compagnie en question sur r\u00e9ception de 1,000 actions du capital ainsi que des redevances. Quatre puits devaient \u00eatre creus\u00e9s, et lorsque l\u2019entente avec l\u2019appelant et son associ\u00e9 est survenue, il restait encore trois puits \u00e0 creuser et \u00e0 financer. En vertu de l\u2019entente, les actions furent divis\u00e9es de telle sorte que chacun des quatre associ\u00e9s en obtint le quart, et les redevances furent divis\u00e9es pareillement.

Appel maintenu.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of No\u00ebl J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], reversing a decision of the Income Tax Appeal Board. Appeal allowed. D.S. Maxwell, Q.C., and D.G.H. Bowman, for the appellant.\nH. Heward Stikeman, Q.C., and P.N. Thorsteinsson, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014This is an appeal by the Minister of National Revenue from the judgment of the Exchequer Court1 which allowed an appeal from the decision of the Tax Appeal Board. This decision had rejected the taxpayer\u2019s contention that he was entitled in computing his income for the year 1957 to deduct a sum of $62,500 paid by him to the Dominion Bank under a guarantee of the indebtedness of Locksley Petroleums Limited signed in 1951. My opinion is that the appeal should be allowed and that the decision of the Board confirming the Minister\u2019s assessment should be restored.\nIn February 1951, the respondent and R.M. Montague made an agreement with William Buechner and Sam Yeske to acquire an interest in a company known as Locksley Petroleums Limited. Buechner and Yeske had obtained a farmout agreement from Imperial Oil on a quarter section of land in Alberta. This they assigned to the Locksley company in return for 1,000 shares and a two and a half per cent gross royalty. They or the company were obligated to drill four wells on the property. In February 1951, when they made their agreement with the respondent and R.M. Montague, his associate, three wells remained to be drilled and financed.\nThe agreement is simple. The shares were divided so that each associate held a quarter interest and the gross royalty was similarly divided. The respondent and Montague also each received three-quarters of one Net Royalty Trust Unit. In return they agreed to guarantee the company\u2019s indebtedness to the Dominion Bank up to the sum of $125,000, the liability of each guarantor being limited to the sum of $62,500. The respondent and Montague also stipulated that the company should assign to the bank the lease which it held on the property as security for the money to be borrowed by the bank and the liability of the guarantors. The total consideration which the respondent received for becoming liable on a guarantee for $62,500 was 250 shares in the company, one-quarter of the gross royalty of two and one-half per cent and three-quarters of one Net Royalty Trust Unit. This consideration was treated as income on a valuation of $4,500 by the Minister of National Revenue and taxed accordingly.\nI have no difficulty in defining the character of this transaction. The company needed money for the drilling of three wells. The convenient way of supplying this money was by a bank loan with the respondent\u2019s guarantee to the extent of $62,500. The guarantee meant that at some time the respondent might have to step into the bank\u2019s shoes to this extent. This happened in 1957. He was then subrogated to the bank\u2019s position. He subsequently proved as a creditor in the company\u2019s bankruptcy and received two dividends\u2014one in 1959 for $6,119 and the other in 1961 for $3,200. The transaction was a deferred loan to the company, part of which was recovered in the bankruptcy. These bankruptcy dividends, contrary to the obiter dictum in the judgment of the Exchequer Court, were not income but a partial recovery of a capital loss. They are in no way analogous to the consideration received in 1951 as the respondent\u2019s remuneration for the guarantee, which I have characterized as a deferred loan.\nIt is enough therefore to decide this case to say that in my opinion the loss here is a loss of capital and that its deduction is prohibited by s. 12(1) (b) of the Act.\nI would allow the appeal with costs here and in the Exchequer Court and restore the assessment appealed from.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: E.S. MacLatchy, Ottawa.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Stikeman & Elliott, Montreal.\n[1] [1965] 2 Ex. C.R. 458, [1965] C.T.C. 181, 65 D.T.C. 5115.\n"}

The convictions were affirmed by a majority judgment in the Court of Appeal. The accused were granted leave to appeal to this Court. There was no appeal from the finding that the material was obscene. The accused submitted that the information was void for duplicity and multiplicity and further that it had been laid under the wrong subsection of s. 150 of the Code.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe gravamen of the offences charged in this case is possession of a quantity of obscene matter. Once possession is established it only remains for the Crown to lead evidence to prove one of the various purposes for which the possession was had, namely, publication, distribution or circulation. It is one offence only which may be committed in different ways. In the circumstances of this case it was not necessary to make each book or pamphlet the subject of a separate count. The various titles recited in the different counts constituted nothing more than particulars of the offences charged.\nOn the facts of this case, the submission that the offence defined in s. 150(1) (a) of the Code could have no application to retail booksellers, such as the appellants, and that the charges should have been laid, under s. 150(2)(a), could not be entertained. The evidence fully justified the inference that the distribution of obscene matter was a part of the business in which the appellants were engaged.\nDroit criminel\u2014Possession de mati\u00e8res obsc\u00e8nes aux fins de les publier, distribuer ou mettre en circulation\u2014Libraire\u2014Accusation port\u00e9e sous l\u2019art. 150(1)(a) du Code criminel\u2014L\u2019accusation contient-elle trios infractions\u2014L\u2019acte d\u2019accusation aurait-il d\u00fb \u00eatre port\u00e9 sous l\u2019art. 150(2)(a)\u2014Code criminel, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, art. 150.\nLa compagnie appelante, propri\u00e9taire de deux librairies et d\u2019un entrep\u00f4t servant \u00e0 l\u2019emmagasinage de livres, a \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9e coupable, ainsi que les autres appelants, d\u2019avoir eu ill\u00e9galement en leur possession des mati\u00e8res obsc\u00e8nes aux fins de les publier, distribuer ou mettre en circulation, le tout contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019art. 150(1) (a) du Code criminel. Le verdict de culpabilit\u00e9 fut confirm\u00e9 par un jugement majoritaire de la Cour d\u2019appel. Les accus\u00e9s ont obtenu permission d\u2019en appeler devant cette Cour. Aucun appel ne fut port\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du verdict que les mati\u00e8res \u00e9taient obsc\u00e8nes.

Il ne s\u2019agit que d\u2019une seule infraction qui peut \u00eatre commise de diverses mani\u00e8res. Dans les circonstances, il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire de faire de chaque livre ou pamphlet le sujet d\u2019un chef d\u2019accusation s\u00e9par\u00e9. Les titres \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s aux divers chefs d\u2019accusation ne constituaient autre chose qu\u2019une communication de d\u00e9tails sur les infractions reproch\u00e9es.\nEn se basant sur les faits de cette cause, la pr\u00e9tention que l\u2019infraction telle que d\u00e9finie \u00e0 l\u2019art. 150(1)(a) du Code ne peut s\u2019appliquer \u00e0 des libraires, tels que les appelants, et que l\u2019acte d\u2019accusation aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre port\u00e9 sous l\u2019art. 150(2)(a), ne peut pas \u00eatre admise.

Appels rejet\u00e9s. APPEALS from three judgments of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[2], affirming a conviction. Appeals dismissed\nJoseph Sedgwick, Q.C., and W.H. Deverell, for the appellants.\nW.G. Burke-Robertson, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from three judgments of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia1 rendered in accordance with a decision of the majority of that Court (Bull J.A. dissenting) which affirmed the convictions of the various appellants before Magistrate G.W. Scott on three separate informations each alleging that the various accused therein named \u201cunlawfully had in their possession\u2026 for the purpose of publication, distribution or circulation a quantity of obscene written matter and pictures\u2026\u201d and each containing separate counts wherein the titles of a number of allegedly obscene publications were recited.\nThe appellant Company, Fraser Book Bin Ltd., is the owner of two retail book shops and a warehouse for the storage of books at Vancouver and Ted Fraser, who is a Director and General Manager of that Company, was at all material times in charge of the Company\u2019s book shop at 1247 Granville Street where he was assisted by the appellant Harris while the appellant Poirier was in charge of the Company\u2019s other book shop at 6184 Fraser Street.\nThe first information relates only to the shop at 1247 Granville Street, the second to the shop at 6184 Fraser Street and the third to the warehouse at 1390 Granville Street. Ted Fraser and Fraser Book Bin Limited are charged in each of the informations but Harris is charged only in the first and Poirier only in the second.\nThe learned Magistrate found that all the publications referred to, except those specified in Count 3 of the first and second informations and Count 1 of the third information, were obscene within the meaning of s. 150(8) of the Criminal Code and Fraser, Harris and Fraser Book Bin Ltd. were found guilty on the first and fourth Counts of the first information on evidence which disclosed that the offending books referred to in those counts were found on the shelves of the shop at 1247 Granville Street at a time when customers were present. The Magistrate acquitted the accused on the second Count of this information on the ground that he had a doubt as to whether they had the motion pictures therein referred to in their possession \u201cfor the purpose of publication, distribution or circulation\u201d.\nWhen the second and third informations came on to be heard no evidence was given as counsel in both cases formally admitted that the accused had the publications and motion pictures therein referred to in their possession \u201cfor the purpose of publication, distribution or circulation\u201d and it was further admitted that the publications referred to in Counts 1 and 2 of the second information and Counts 2 and 3 of the third information were \u201cidentical in nature\u201d with publications which the learned Magistrate had found to be \u201cobscene\u201d at the trial of the first information.\nFraser, Harris and the Company appealed their conviction on the first information on the ground that the shop at 1247 Granville Street was a retail book store exclusively operated for the purpose of selling books to individuals and that the charges contained in that information, alleging as they did that they had the publications \u201cin their possession\u2026 for the purpose of publication, distribution or circulation\u201d were charges framed in the language of s. 150(1) (a) of the Criminal Code which section was intended to be reserved for the prosecution of makers, publishers and wholesale distributors of obscene material and had no application to the selling of such material by retail which is the subject of s. 150(2) (a) of the Code.\nThe two subsections in question read as follows:\n150 (1) Every one commits an offence who\n(a) makes, prints, publishes, distributes, circulates, or has in his possession for the purpose of publication, distribution or circulation any obscene written matter, picture, model, phonograph record or other thing whatsoever, or\u2026\n150 (2) Every one commits an offence who knowingly, without lawful justification or excuse,\n(a) sells, exposes to public view or has in his possession for such a purpose any obscene written matter, picture, model, phonograph record or other thing whatsoever,\u2026 The essence of the submission in this regard is that the accused in the first information were charged under the wrong subsection and the distinction between the two sub-sections is said to be reinforced by the fact that s. 150(6) provides that ignorance of the nature or presence of the material by means of or in relation to which the offence was committed is not a defence to a charge under s. 150(1) (a) whereas when a charge is laid under s. 150(2) (a) the burden rests upon the Crown to prove that the accused had knowledge of the nature and presence of the material in respect of which it was laid.\nIt was upon this latter ground that Bull J.A., in the course of his dissenting opinion in the Court of Appeal found that the first information should have been quashed. This ground of appeal was, however, not open to those convicted on the second and third informations because of the formal admissions hereinbefore referred to.\nThe second ground of appeal, which applies to all the informations, was unanimously dismissed by the Court of Appeal for British Columbia and was the subject of an order granting leave to appeal to this Court by which it was expressly confined to the issue raised by the contention:\nThat each of the counts in each of the said informations is bad and void for duplicity and multiplicity.\nThere is no appeal from the finding of the learned Magistrate with respect to obscenity which was unanimously affirmed by the Court of Appeal.\nThe appellants\u2019 submission that all the counts are void for \u201cduplicity and multiplicity\u201d is twofold. In the first place it is contended that the charge of having in their \u201cpossession\u2026 for the purpose of publication, distribution and circulation, a quantity of obscene written matter\u2026\u201d involves three separate charges each of which should be the subject of a separate count; and in the second place it is argued that possession of each publication constitutes a separate offence which should have been charged separately and that the counts each charging the accused with having a number of different publications in their possession are therefore void.\nI agree with the members of the Court of Appeal that the gravamen of the offences charged in these informations is \u201cpossession\u201d of a \u201cquantity of obscene matter\u2026\u201d and that the various titles recited in the different Counts constitute nothing more than particulars of the offences charged of the kind which the Court would have been justified in ordering to be delivered to the accused under the provisions of s. 497 of the Code. In this regard I can do no better than to adopt the language used by Maclean J.A., in the course of his reasons for judgment in the Court of Appeal where he said:\nIn my view the gravamen of the charge is \u2018possession\u2019. Once possession is established it only remains for the Crown to lead evidence to prove one of the various purposes for which the possession was had, namely, publication, distribution or circulation. In other words, it is one offence only which may be committed in different ways.\nI am fortified in this view by Couture v. The Queen, supra, where the charge of \u2018having in possession for sale, distribution or circulation\u2019 was regarded as one offence. Duplicity was found in that case only because the full charge alleged that the accused \u2018made, printed and had in possession for sale, distribution or circulation\u2019.\nDealing with the second branch of the appellants on duplicity, it is my view that the enumeration of a number of book titles is merely a particularization of the expression \u2018a quantity of obscene written matter\u2019. In my view, in the circumstances of this case it was not necessary to make each book or pamphlet the subject of a separate count.\nThe submission that the offence defined in s. 150(1) (a) as charged in the first information could have no application to retail booksellers such as the appellants named therein, was advanced with great force by Mr. Sedgewick. In this regard it was argued that a retail bookseller might well have acquired his stock in bulk and never have read any of the offensive books or, indeed, that he might be a blind man, and it was strenuously contended that Parliament could never have intended that such a person could be exposed to a charge under s. 150(1) (a) and thus, by virtue of s. 150(6), be deprived of the defence that he was ignorant of the presence or contents of such books which defence would have been open to him if he had been charged as a \u201cseller\u201d under s. 150(2) (a).\nHowever persuasive this argument may be thought to be, it does not appear to me to fit the circumstances of the present case. Here the appellant company, with the appellant Fraser as its General Manager, was proved to be operating a warehouse from which books were distributed to its two retail outlets one of which was referred to in the first information and was the place where the third appellant, Harris, was employed. This was, in my opinion, an organization for the distribution of books, a substantial number of which were found to be obscene.\nIn this regard the following excerpt from the evidence of the detective who supervised the seizure of the offending books appears to me to be revealing:\nI did go with Detective Matches to 1247 Granville Street, where I met Mr. Fraser and he told us at that time that he was the General Manager of Fraser Book Bin and that particular store. He took us to a warehouse at 1390 Granville and he told us he also had another store at 6184 Fraser, that they did a large volume of business in mail order as well as counter business, all over the world, both buying and selling.\nI agree with the view expressed by Maclean J.A. on behalf of the majority of the Court of Appeal that the word \u201cdistribution\u201d as used in s. 150(1) (a) \u201cis obviously a word of wider connotation than \u2018sale\u2019 as sale is only one of a number of means of distribution\u201d. The appellant submitted that this construction would mean that everyone who \u201csells\u201d within the meaning of s. 150(2) (a) would also be guilty of the offence defined in s. 150(1) (a) and that the provisions of the former section would thus be \u201creduced to a futility\u201d to employ the language used in the factum filed on behalf of the appellants. Like Mr. Justice Maclean, however, I can envisage cases of individual sales which would constitute an offence under s. 150(2) (a) and yet would not be a \u201cdistribution\u201d within the meaning of s. 150(1) (a), and I think also that there may well be cases of a bookseller who has in his shop a scattered few of these publications amongst a mass of inoffensive books, where a charge of possession for the purpose of sale contrary to s. 150(2) (a) would be more appropriate than one relating to \u201cdistribution\u201d under s. 150(1) (a).\nThere may, indeed, be many cases in which it is difficult to determine which of these two subsections should be invoked in a prosecution but, in my opinion, the present circumstances do not present any such difficulty. I am satisfied that the evidence called in respect of the first information fully justifies the inference that the distribution of obscene written matter was a part of the business in which the appellants Fraser and Fraser Book Bin Ltd. were engaged and that the appellant Harris was employed as an active participant in that business. For these reasons I would dismiss the appeals of all the appellants and affirm the convictions entered by the learned Magistrate.\nAppeals dismissed.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Macey, Dowding & Co., Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Cumming, Bird & Richards, Vancouver.\n[1] (1965), 52 W.W.R. 712, [1966] 1 C.C.C. 110.\n[2] (1965), 52 W.W.R. 712, [1966] 1 C.C.C. 110.\n"}

The defendants imported and sold in Canada products containing one of these substances. The plaintiffs brought an action for infringement of their patent and restricted their action to only one of the three processes, and relied upon the presumption contained in s. 41(2) of the Patent Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 203. Neither the plaintiffs nor the defendants had any knowledge as to the process by which the substance complained of was prepared or produced. The trial judge ruled that the plaintiffs could not rely upon the presumption and dismissed the action. He did not express any opinion as to the other defences, including an attack upon the validity of the patent. The plaintiffs appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the case referred back to the Exchequer Court for consideration of the other defences.\nThe trial judge erred in holding that s. 41(2) of the Patent Act was inapplicable where there was more than one process claimed and thus patented. It would place an impossible burden on a plaintiff and defeat the object of the subsection to rule that where a patent makes a claim to different methods of producing a substance, the presumption of infringement provided by s. 41(2) is inapplicable unless it can be shown that the substance is produced according to all the various processes set out in the claims.\nBrevets\u2014Contrefa\u00e7on\u2014Pr\u00e9paration chimique\u2014Revendication de trois proc\u00e9d\u00e9s\u2014Importation d\u2019un produit semblable\u2014Action en contrefa\u00e7on restreinte \u00e0 seulement un des proc\u00e9d\u00e9s\u2014Y a-t-il lieu d\u2019appliquer la pr\u00e9somption de l\u2019art. 41(2) de la Loi sur les Brevets, S.R.C. 1952, c. 203.\nLe brevet poss\u00e9d\u00e9 par lea demandeurs d\u00e9crit et revendique trois diff\u00e9rents proc\u00e9d\u00e9s pour produire certaines substances chimiques.

Appel maintenu.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Thurlow J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, dismissing an action for infringement. Appeal allowed.\nRussell S. Smart and Robert H. Barrigar, for the plaintiffs, appellants.\nI. Goldsmith and C.A.G. Palmer, for the defendants, respondents. The judgment of the Court was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014This is an action brought by Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Usines Chimiques Rhone-Poulenc and Ciba, S.A., for infringement of Patent No. 474,637 for improvements relating to substituted diamines. The patent was granted under s. 41(1) of the Patent Act, which reads:\n41. (1) In the case of inventions relating to substances prepared or produced by chemical processes and intended for food or medicine, the specification shall not include claims for the substance itself, except when prepared or produced by the methods or processes of manufacture particularly described and claimed or by their obvious chemical equivalents.\nThe patent disclosed and claimed not one but three processes. The plaintiffs restricted their action to only one of these\u2014claim 18. In these circumstances the learned trial judge[2] dismissed the action. The basis for his decision was that while s. 41(2) of the Patent Act might apply to raise the presumption that the alleged infringing substance was produced by some one or another of these three processes, the subsection cannot be read as raising the presumption that the substance was made by any particular one of them. Since there was no presumption to be applied, he consequently found that there was no basis for finding that the substance was made by the process of claim 18.\nIn so holding, in my respectful opinion, the learned trial judge was in error. Section 41 (2) reads:\n41. (2) In an action for infringement of a patent where the invention relates to the production of a new substance, any substance of the same chemical composition and constitution shall, in the absence of proof to the contrary, be deemed to have been produced by the patented process.\nThe plaintiffs proved a case by putting in patent No. 474,637 and an agreed statement of facts as follows:\nFor the purposes of this action the parties have agreed:\n1. That the process claimed in claim 18 of Canadian patent No. 474,637 consists in the application of methods which were known on June 22nd, 1943, to substances which were also known on the said date, though the said methods had never at the said date been applied to the said substances except by the inventor named in the said patent.\n2. That the substance referred to in paragraphs 6 and 7 of the reamended Statement of Defence was not manufactured in Canada and was imported from outside Canada.\n3. That none of the defendants has any knowledge as to the process by which the said substance was prepared or produced. They also proved the chemical composition of the substance and its sale by the defendants. They then relied upon the presumption set out in s. 41 (2).\nThe defence raised a number of issues on infringement and attacked the validity of the claim in suit. The learned trial judge deliberately refrained from expressing any opinion on these matters. For the purpose of his reasons he assumed the validity of the patent and said that the plaintiff could not rely upon the presumption. He therefore decided the case on very narrow grounds. The judgment means that where a patent makes a claim to different methods of producing a substance, the presumption of infringement provided by s. 41(2) is inapplicable unless it can be shown that it is produced according to all the various processes set out in the claims. This obviously places an impossible burden on a plaintiff and defeats the object of the subsection.\nThis s. 41(1) patent is for a substance produced by three methods or processes. This is permitted by s. 41(1). Section 41(1) does not make it necessary to have three separate applications for the same substance, one by each process. The action is brought for infringement and one of these processes is pleaded. There is no reason why when the plaintiff frames its action in this way that the presumption in s. 41(2) should not apply. We are all of the opinion that the learned trial judge was in error in holding that s. 41(2) is inapplicable where there is more than one process claimed and thus patented.\nThe appeal is allowed with costs and the judgment of the Exchequer Court dismissing the action with costs is set aside. The case is remitted to the Exchequer Court to be dealt with on the matters remaining to be considered.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, appellants: Smart & Biggar, Ottawa.\nSolicitors for the defendants, respondents: Duncan, Goldsmith & Caswell, Toronto.\n[1] [1966] Ex.

The breach of contract committed by the defendant was the withdrawal by it from a high school, which was under the jurisdiction of the plaintiff, of a number of students prior to the commencement of the school year 1963-1964 who under the terms of the contract should have been left to complete their secondary school education at the said school. The students concerned would, if the contract had been carried out, have continued at this school during the school years 1963-1964, 1964-1965 and 1965-1966 and the cost of their education would have been payable by the defendant.\nThe trial judge found that the plaintiff had suffered proven damages of $45,234 but held that the action should be dismissed on the ground that, while there was a parol contract made between the parties the breach of which by the defendant had caused the aforesaid damages, the contract could not be enforced because it was not made under seal. The Court of Appeal agreed with the views of the trial judge as to the construction of the contract and as to its having been breached by the defendant but held that it was enforceable notwithstanding the absence of the corporate seal, by virtue of the provisions of s. 293 of The Corporations Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 71.\nThe Court of Appeal was, however, of the view that in the circumstances of this case the damages should be assessed only down to the date of the judgment at trial and that, if they were to be assessed by the Court of Appeal, they should be assessed only down to the date of the judgment of that Court. Accordingly, the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and directed a reference to determine the damages to the end of the calendar year 1964, without prejudice to the plaintiff\u2019s right to take further proceedings to recover damages arising thereafter and accruing until the termination of the defendant\u2019s obligation.\nFrom this judgment the defendant appealed to this Court and the plaintiff cross-appealed on the question of the assessment of damages. At the conclusion of the argument for the appellant the Court, having retired to consider the matter, stated that, except in regard to the assessment of damages, it agreed with the reasons for judgment of the Court of Appeal and that consequently it would be necessary to hear consel for the respondent only on the question raised in the cross-appeal. A request that the damages should now be assessed once and for all was made by both parties.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed and the cross-appeal allowed.\nThe assessment of damages made by the trial judge should be accepted. The amount at which he assessed the damages was that set out in a statement prepared by a chartered accountant who had been for several years the auditor for the respondent. On the first of the two questions raised as to the accuracy of this statement, i.e., as to the starting figure, being the number of students who were wrongly taken away in September 1963, the Court found that the trial judge was right in accepting the plaintiff\u2019s figure of 39 students. As to the second question, i.e., as to the estimated \u201cretention factor\u201d used in calculating the loss for future years, the soundness of the estimates that were made was established by the evidence.\nAPPEAL and CROSS-APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], allowing an appeal from a judgment of Lieff J., whereby an action for breach of contract was dismissed. Appeal dismissed and cross-appeal allowed.\nC.F. MacKewn and G.T. Mitches, for the defendant, appellant.\nW.B. Williston, Q.C., and R.J. Rolls, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1 allowing an appeal from the judgment of Lieff J. pronounced on August 11, 1964, finding that the respondent had suffered proven damages of $45,234 but holding that the action should be dismissed.\nThe reasons of Lieff J. proceeded on the ground that, while there was a parol contract made between the parties the breach of which by the appellant had caused the damages mentioned above, the contract could not be enforced because it was not made under seal. The Court of Appeal agreed with the views of Lieff J. as to the construction of the contract and as to its having been breached by the appellant but held that it was enforceable notwithstanding the absence of the corporate seal, by virtue of the provisions of s. 293 of The Corporations Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 71, which had not been brought to the attention of the learned trial judge. The Court of Appeal was, however, of the view that in the circumstances of this case the damages should have been assessed only down to the date of the judgment at trial and that, if they were to be assessed by the Court of Appeal, they should be assessed only down to the date of the judgment of that Court. In the result the Court of Appeal gave judgment declaring \u201cthat the contract referred to in the pleadings herein is valid and binding upon the defendant and that the defendant has committed a breach thereof\u201d and directing a reference as to damages in the following terms:\n3. And this Court doth order and adjudge that the matter be referred to the Master of this Court at London to inquire into and to determine the damages sustained by the Plaintiff to the end of the calendar year 1964.\n4. And this Court doth further order and adjudge that the defendant do pay to the plaintiff such sum as the said Master may find the plaintiff entitled to as damages aforesaid forthwith after the confirmation of the said Master\u2019s Report according to the usual practice in that behalf.\n5. And this Court doth further order and adjudge that this Order be without prejudice to the plaintiff\u2019s right to take such further appropriate proceedings as it may be advised to recover damages arising from the defendant\u2019s breach of contract after the end of the calendar year 1964 and accruing until the termination of the defendant\u2019s obligation.\nAt the conclusion of the argument of counsel for the appellant the Court, after having retired to consider the matter, stated that, except in regard to the assessment of damages, we agreed with the reasons for judgment of the Court of Appeal, delivered by Schroeder J.A., which we desired to adopt as our own and that consequently it would be necessary to hear counsel for the respondent only on the question raised in the notice of cross-appeal, that is, as to whether the direction of the Court of Appeal as to the method of assessing the damages should be set aside and judgment entered for the amount of damages assessed by the learned trial judge.\nIn answer to questions put by the Court before counsel for the respondent opened his argument on the cross-appeal, counsel for both parties stated that they would prefer that damages should now be assessed once and for all and requested that this be done. This relieved us from the necessity of inquiring whether or not in the absence of such a request a reference as provided in its judgment should have been directed by the Court of Appeal and I express no opinion upon that question. The amount at which the learned trial judge assessed the damages was that set out in a statement, ex. 16, prepared by the witness Kime, a chartered accountant who had been for several years the auditor for the respondent. It was he who had calculated the amounts due under the contract in question for the year 1961, $172,739.36, and for the year 1962, $136,521.22, both of which were accepted as correct by the appellant and duly paid.\nIt is not necessary to set out ex. 16 in detail. It should be explained that the breach of contract committed by the appellant was the withdrawal by it from Medway High School, which is under the jurisdiction of the respondent, of a number of students prior to the commencement of the school year 1963-1964 who under the terms of the contract should have been left to complete their secondary school education at Medway High School. The students concerned would, if the contract had been carried out, have continued at Medway during the school years 1963-1964, 1964-1965 and 1965-1966 and the cost of their education would have been payable by the appellant.\nIt became clear during the course of the argument before us that only two, questions are raised as to the accuracy of ex. 16. The first was as to the starting figure, being the number of students who were wrongly taken away in September 1963. The figure used in the statement is 39. The appellant contends it should have been only 36. The second is as to the estimated \u201cretention factor\u201d used in calculating the loss for future years.\nI will deal first with the second of these questions. In calculating the loss for the 1964-1965 school year it was estimated that only 85 per cent of the students who had completed the 1963-1964 year would have attended and in calculating the loss for the 1965-1966 school year it was estimated that only 60 per cent of those who had completed the 1964-1965 year would have attended. While these were of necessity estimates their soundness was established by the evidence of the witness Mr. Hoople, Principal of Medway, which was neither contradicted by other evidence nor weakened on cross-examination.\nDealing next with the question whether the starting figure should have been 39 or 36, it appears that prior to the commencement of the 1963-1964 school year the appellant obtained the transfer from Medway High School of the records of 42 students who had been in regular attendance at Medway during the year 1962\u20111963. The names of these 42 students are set out in ex. 10. As to three of these Mr. Hoople, who appears to have acted throughout with exemplary fairness, said that he had reason to believe they would not have continued at Medway even if the appellant had continued to perform its part of the contract and thus the respondent\u2019s claim was reduced to 39.\nAt the trial counsel for the appellant claimed that in addition to the three students mentioned in the preceding paragraph three other students whose records had been transferred to it at its demand should not be included in calculating the respondent\u2019s claim, these being Jack Christianson, Jack Small and Charles Stock, but no evidence was given to show why they should not be included. No doubt on the pleadings the onus of proving its damages lay upon the plaintiff but when it had proved that the defendant had, in breach of its contract, withdrawn the records of 42 students and that those students had not returned to Medway it appears to me that the burden of adducing evidence shifted to the defendant if it sought to assert that these three named students would not in any event have returned to Medway. No such evidence was adduced and in my opinion the learned trial judge was right in accepting the plaintiff\u2019s starting figure of 39 students.\nI conclude therefore that the assessment of damages made by the learned trial judge should be accepted.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs, allow the cross-appeal without costs, set aside paras. 3, 4 and 5 of the formal judgment of the Court of Appeal and that part of para. 6 thereof which deals with the costs of the Reference and direct that judgment be entered in favour of the respondent against the appellant for the sum of $45,234.\nAppeal dismissed with costs; cross-appeal allowed without costs.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Mitches & MacKewn, London.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: Gillies, Saint & Paddon, London.\n[1] [1965] 2 O.R. 51, 49 D.L.R.

The collision occurred in mid-channel in a stretch of water known as Graham Reach, where, it is agreed, it constitutes a narrow channel within the meaning of the rules. The Unimak, which was proceeding in a southerly direction, was not steering by compass but was merely following the western shore line until it was thought to be too close whereupon an abrupt alteration was made to port. As to the Pacific Wind, it was proceeding in a northerly direction, on a course which was bringing the vessel to mid-channel. The collision ensued in spite of the fact that an order was given to alter the course of the Pacific Wind to starboard. No appeal was taken from the finding that the negligence of the Unimak had contributed to the collision. However, the Pacific Wind appealed to this Court from the trial judge\u2019s finding that it was equally negligent.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThere was no reason to disturb the finding of negligence against the Pacific Wind. It could not be said that in making the apportionment which he did the trial judge was in any way acting on a wrong ground of law or conclusion of fact. The Pacific Wind\u2019s negligence was such as to make it impossible to establish different degrees of fault between the vessels, within the meaning of s. 648(2) of the Canada Shipping Act.\nNavigation\u2014Collision entre deux bateaux\u2014Chenal \u00e9troit\u2014N\u00e9gligence des deux bateaux\u2014Impossibilit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9tablir le degr\u00e9 de faute de chacun\u2014Application de l\u2019art. 648(2) de la Loi sur la Marine marchande du Canada, S.R.C. 1952, c. 29. Le juge au proc\u00e8s a r\u00e9parti la responsabilit\u00e9 \u00e9galement entre le d\u00e9fendeur et les demandeurs quant aux dommages qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 subis par les demandeurs \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une collision dans les eaux c\u00f4ti\u00e8res de la Colombie-Britannique entre le bateau de p\u00eache Unimak appartenant aux demandeurs et le p\u00e9trolier Pacific Wind appartenant au d\u00e9fendeur. La collision a eu lieu au milieu du chenal dans une \u00e9tendue d\u2019eau connue sous le nom de Graham Reach. Les parties sont d\u2019accord que cet endroit constitue un chenal \u00e9troit dans le sens des r\u00e8gles. L\u2019Unimak, qui se dirigeait vers le sud, ne navigait pas au compas mais se contentait de longer la c\u00f4te ouest. Un ordre soudain de changer de route vers la gauche fut donn\u00e9 lorsqu\u2019il fut r\u00e9alis\u00e9 qu\u2019on \u00e9tait peut-\u00eatre trop pr\u00e8s de la c\u00f4te. Quant au Pacific Wind, il se dirigeait vers le nord et suivait une route qui devait \u00e9ventuellement l\u2019amener vers le milieu du chenal. La collision se produisit malgr\u00e9 le fait qu\u2019un ordre de changer la route du Pacific Wind vers la droite ait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9. Aucun appel ne fut interjet\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du verdict que la n\u00e9gligence du Unimak avait contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 la collision. Par contre, le Pacific Wind en appela devant cette Cour du verdict qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9gligent en proportion \u00e9gale.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9.\nIl n\u2019existe aucune raison pour changer le verdict de n\u00e9gligence port\u00e9 contre le Pacific Wind. On ne peut pas dire que le juge au proc\u00e8s a agi en vertu d\u2019un motif de droit erron\u00e9 ou d\u2019une conclusion de fait erron\u00e9e lorsqu\u2019il a r\u00e9parti la responsabilit\u00e9 \u00e9galement. La n\u00e9gligence du Pacific Wind \u00e9tait telle qu\u2019il \u00e9tait impossible d\u2019\u00e9tablir le diff\u00e9rent degr\u00e9 de faute entre les deux bateaux, dans le sens de l\u2019art. 648(2) de la Loi sur la Marine marchande du Canada.\nAPPEL d\u2019un jugement du Juge Gibson de la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier du Canada, si\u00e9geant dans le district d\u2019Amiraut\u00e9 de la Colombie-Britannique. Appel rejet\u00e9.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Gibson J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada, sitting in the British Columbia Admiralty District. Appeal dismissed.\nJ.I. Bird, Q.C., and W.O. Forbes, for the defendant, appellant.\nD.B. Smith and T.P. Cameron, for the plaintiffs, respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment rendered by Mr. Justice Gibson of the Exchequer Court of Canada, sitting with two nautical assessors in the British Columbia Admiralty District, whereby he apportioned liability equally between the appellant and the respondents in respect of damage alleged to have been sustained by the respondents as the result of a collision which occurred in the coastal waters of British Columbia at 5:15 a.m. on a clear November morning between the fishing vessel Unimak and the tanker Pacific Wind. The learned trial judge found that the two ships collided in about mid-channel in a stretch of water known as Graham Reach at a point therein about 8 cables north of its juncture with another stretch of water called Tolmie Channel which runs into it from the south. The learned trial judge fixed the approximate point of collision as being about 3 cables south of Quarrie Point on the western shore of Graham Reach where the Department of Transport has installed a flashing green light as an aid to navigation. All these matters appear with greater clarity by reference to the Department of Mines and Technical Surveys Chart No. 3758 entitled \u201cSarah Island to Swanson Bay\u201d and it is agreed between the parties that at the point where the collision took place Graham Reach constitutes a \u201cnarrow channel\u201d within the meaning of Rule 25A of the Regulations for the Prevention of Collisions at Sea.\nAs the events developed which finally culminated in the collision, the Unimak, a fishing vessel about 58 feet in length, with a gross tonnage of 57.23 tons, was proceeding in a southerly direction in Graham Reach at about 8 knots loaded with a catch of fish on her way from her fishing grounds to Vancouver, whereas the Pacific Wind, an oil tanker about 230 feet in length with a gross tonnage of 1560.56 tons, was proceeding down Tolmie Channel in a northerly direction at between 10 and 11 knots on a voyage from Shellburn to Kitimat, B.C., loaded with a full cargo of fuel oil. Both vessels were equipped with radar but it is apparent that the Unimak was making no effective use of this aid although radar \u2018fixes\u2019 taken aboard the Pacific Wind enabled the mate to determine the position of the Unimak when she was six miles away and at that time was showing her green light. As Pacific Wind proceeded down Tolmie Channel she held her course to 342 degrees magnetic and maintained her speed while the Unimak proceeding up Graham Reach was not steering by any compass course at all but was merely following the western shore line until it was thought to be too close whereupon an abrupt alteration was made to port and the vessel ran on its new course for about five minutes.\nThe learned trial judge has reviewed the contradictory evidence at some length and I do not propose to retrace the steps which he has taken with obvious care and with the expert assistance of the assessors who sat with him. I think it sufficient to say that he found that the crew in charge of the Unimak at all relevant times was incompetent, failed to keep an adequate lookout, took no adequate precautions to avoid collision when it became imminent and navigated just prior to the time of the collision in or about the center of the channel. This is a clear finding of negligence which contributed to the collision and subsequent damage and no appeal has been taken from it so that in my opinion the only question to be determined on this appeal is whether the Pacific Wind was also negligent and if so whether its negligence was such as to make it impossible to establish different degrees of fault between the vessels.\nIt is important to observe that if the course of 342 magnetic steered by the Pacific Wind had been maintained after entering Graham Reach from Tolmie Channel it would have brought the vessel well over to the west of mid-channel by the time it reached Quarrie Point. There is no doubt that an order to alter the course to starboard so as to bring the vessel to the eastward had been given very shortly before Pacific Wind entered Graham Reach but the learned trial judge found the evidence to be inconclusive \u201cas to precisely when the first order was given to manoeuver the vessel Pacific Wind to starboard\u201d and the fact of the matter is that she was in or about mid-channel at the time of collision so that, in my opinion, whenever the order was given it was not soon enough.\nThe actions of Pacific Wind are to be judged in light of the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, Rule 25A of which reads as follows:\nIn a narrow channel every power-driven vessel when proceeding along the course of the channel shall, when it is safe and practicable, keep to that side of the fairway or mid-channel which lies on the starboard side of such vessel.\nThis rule, like the other \u201cSteering and Sailing Rules\u201d is required to be obeyed in accordance with the preliminary paragraphs of Part C of the Regulations, the first of which provides that:\nIn obeying and construing these Rules, any action taken should be positive, in ample time, and with due regard to the observance of good seamanship.\n(The italics are my own).\nIt is to be remembered that Pacific Wind had first been alerted to the presence of an approaching vessel, which was then showing a green light, at a distance of 6 miles and it seems to me that it should have been possible to take steps to, ensure that the Pacific Wind was well in its own waters in time for the two vessels to pass safely notwithstanding the erratic and unpredictable manner in which the Unimak was being navigated.\nThe learned trial judge also found that the failure of Pacific Wind to reduce speed earlier than she did was a factor which contributed to the collision and I see no reason to disturb his finding.\nSection 648 of the Canada Shipping Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 29, reads, in part, as follows:\n648. (1) Where, by the fault of two or more vessels, damage or loss is caused to one or more of those vessels, to their cargoes or freight, or to any property on board, the liability to make good the damage or loss shall be in proportion to the degree in which each vessel was in fault.\n(2) Where, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, it is not possible to establish different degrees of fault, the liability shall be apportioned equally.\nIn the present case, after having seen and heard the evidence of those who were aboard the respective vessels at the time of the collision and having had the advantage of the advice of two nautical assessors, the learned trial judge found it impossible to establish different degrees of fault, and although Mr. Bird, in his very able argument on behalf of the appellant, cast some doubt on the learned trial judge\u2019s findings as to credibility, I am nevertheless satisfied that this is not a case where a court of appeal should interfere with his conclusions.\nThe difficult problem of measuring the degrees of fault in the navigation of two ships is one which, as Lord Buck-master said in the House of Lords in SS. Kitano Maru v. SS. Otranto[1]:\n\u2026is primarily a matter for the judge at the trial, and unless there is some error in law or fact in his judgment it ought not to be disturbed. The matter was put with perhaps greater force by Lord Justice Scrutton in The Luso[2], where he said at page 165 with respect to a finding at trial which had established different degrees of fault between two vessels:\n\u2026before the Court of Appeal ought to interfere with that finding they must be able to put their finger on something and say that the learned Judge has been wrong on some particular point and that that particular point is so substantial that if he had taken what we say is the right view of it he must have altered the proportion of damage.\nBoth these last quoted cases are referred to with approval in this Court by Davis J. in S.S. Benmaple v. Ship Lafayette[3], where he applied the same principle; saying of the trial judge in that case:\n\u2026we are not satisfied that in making the apportionment he did he was in any degree acting either on any wrong ground of law or conclusion of fact.\nThe decision of Lord Sumner in S.S. Hontestroom v. S.S. Sagaporack[4], which was cited with approval by Martland J. in Prudential Trust Co. Ltd. v. Forseth[5], is to the same effect.\nNotwithstanding the doubts suggested by Mr. Bird as to the accuracy of the reconstruction by the learned trial judge of certain of the movements of the two vessels immediately before and at the time of the accident, I am not satisfied that in making the apportionment which he did he was in any way acting on a wrong ground of law or conclusion of fact and I would accordingly dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Campney, Owen & Murphy, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, respondents: Bull, Housser & Tupper, Vancouver.\n[1] [1931] A.C. 194 at 204.\n[2] (1934), 49 LI.

In March 1960, and as required by the regulations, made under the provisions of the Radio Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 233, then in force, the company paid a licence fee of $6,000 for the period from April 1, 1960 to March 31, 1961. On October 28, 1960, the regulations were amended by an Order in Council which provided for a scale of licence fees calculated on a different basis than the one provided for in the earlier regulations. The effect of s. 5(5) of the new regulations was to increase the licence fee payable by the company for the year ending March 31, 1961. As a result, the company paid under protest a sum of $5,452.30 which had been claimed as additional licence fees.\nBy its petition of right, the company claimed a refund of the $5,452.30, and alleged that the new s. 5 of the regulations, as enacted by the Order in Council, was ultra vires on the following grounds: (1) that it does not prescribe a licence fee but imposes a tax without parliamentary sanction; (2) that it was unjust and discriminatory; (3) that it affects the rights of the company and others in a retroactive manner not authorized by the enabling legislation; (4) that it was beyond the authority of the governor in council and infringed on the exclusive authority of the Minister of Transport. The Exchequer Court held that the new s. 5 was invalid and ultra vires. The Crown appealed to this Court and the company cross-appealed.\nHeld (Taschereau C.J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the cross-appeal dismissed.\nPer Fauteux, Abbott and Ritchie JJ.: It could not be said that the new s. 5 of the regulations imposes a tax and not a licence fee. A licence issued by the Minister of Transport was required by the company to operate, and licence fees prescribed by the governor in council must be paid to hold such a licence. The changing of the tariff of such licence by the Order in Council in question in no way changed the character of the levy.\nNeither could it be said that the new s. 5 was discriminatory. In any event, since s. 3 of the Radio Act puts no limitation upon the powers of the governor in council to prescribe licence fees, the fact that they may be discriminatory affords no legal ground of attack upon the validity of the regulation.\nNeither could it be said that the new s. 5(5) was invalid because it purported to legislate on a matter over which the governor in council did not have authority, but only the Minister of Transport. Under the Radio Act, the Minister of Transport, as the minister responsible for the administration of the Act, is no doubt required to collect the licence fees prescribed by the governor in council but, except in his capacity as one member of the executive branch, he has no authority to determine what the tariff of such fees should be.\nThe contention that the new s. 5 was invalid because it had a retroactive effect, could not be sustained. If the order did have retroactive effect,\u2014as to which it was not necessary to express an opinion\u2014s. 3 of the Radio Act contains no limitation upon the power of the governor in council to make such an order. In view of the nature of the right held by a person licenced to operate a private commercial broadcasting station,\u2014being a privilege granted by the state\u2014the governor in council can validly increase or decrease the fees payable by such a licensee at any time during the currency of the licence. In this case the Order in Council clearly expresses an intention to affect the licence fees payable for the then current licence year.\nPer Hall J.: The Order in Council was retroactive legislation, however, it was validly enacted under the power given the governor in council by the Radio Act and it clearly expressed the retroactive effect it was intended to achieve.\nPer Taschereau C.J., dissenting: The Order in Council was illegal because it violated the principle of non-retro activity. In our juridical system there can be no retroactivity in a statute unless the text enacted by the legislator clearly expresses an intention to legislate not only for the future, but also for the past. This also applies in the case where the legislator delegates his powers to a subordinate body. Section 3 of the Radio Act, which gives to the governor in council the power to prescribe the tariff of licence fees, speaks only for the future and not for the past. The Order in Council went therefore beyond the powers of the governor in council when it purported to affect the licence fees payable for the current licence year.\nThe contention that only the Minister of Transport, and not the governor in council, could legislate in this matter, cannot be accepted. Under s. 3 of the Radio Act exclusive authority to prescribe the tariff of fees to be paid for the licence is given to the governor in council.

Le 28 octobre, les r\u00e8glements \u00e9taient amend\u00e9s par un arr\u00eat\u00e9 en conseil pr\u00e9voyant une \u00e9chelle de droits de licence calcul\u00e9e sur une base diff\u00e9rente de celle pr\u00e9vue dans la r\u00e9glementation ant\u00e9rieure. L\u2019art. 5(5) de la nouvelle r\u00e9glementation a eu pour effet d\u2019augmenter les droits de licence payables par la compagnie pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e se terminant le 31 mars 1961. Comme r\u00e9sultat de ce changement, une demande de paiement additionnel, au montant de $5,452.30, a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite \u00e0 la compagnie, et cette derni\u00e8re paya le montant sous prot\u00eat.\nLa compagnie a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 ce montant de $5,452.30 par p\u00e9tition de droit, et a attaqu\u00e9 la validit\u00e9 du nouvel art. 5 des r\u00e8glements, tel qu\u2019\u00e9dict\u00e9 par l\u2019arr\u00eat\u00e9 en conseil, pour les motifs qu\u2019il: (1) ne prescrit pas des droits de licence mais impose une taxe sans l\u2019autorit\u00e9 du parlement; (2) est injuste et discriminatoire; (3) affecte les droits de la compagnie et autres d\u2019une fa\u00e7on r\u00e9troactive et non autoris\u00e9e par la Loi sur la Radio; (4) va au-del\u00e0 de l\u2019autorit\u00e9 du gouverneur en conseil et empi\u00e8te sur l\u2019autorit\u00e9 exclusive du Ministre des Transports. La Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier a jug\u00e9 que le nouvel art. 5 \u00e9tait invalide et ultra vires. La Couronne en appela devant cette Cour et la compagnie a port\u00e9 un contre-appel.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel doit \u00eatre maintenu et le contre-appel rejet\u00e9, le Juge en chef Taschereau \u00e9tant dissident.\nLes Juges Fauteux, Abbott et Ritchie: On ne peut pas dire que le nouvel art. 5 des r\u00e8glements impose une taxe et non un droit de licence. Pour exploiter son commerce la compagnie doit avoir une licence \u00e9mise par le Ministre des Transports, et le d\u00e9tenteur d\u2019une telle licence doit payer les droits de licence prescrits par le gouverneur en conseil. Le fait de changer le tarif des droits \u00e0 payer pour les licences par l\u2019arr\u00eat\u00e9 en conseil en question ne change d\u2019aucune mani\u00e8re le caract\u00e8re du paiement.\nOn ne peut pas dire non plus que le nouvel art. 5 est discriminatoire. A tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, puisque l\u2019art. 3 de la Loi sur la Radio n\u2019apporte aucune limite aux pouvoirs du gouverneur en conseil de prescrire les droits de licence, le fait que ces droits peuvent \u00eatre discriminatoires n\u2019offre aucun motif l\u00e9gal pour attaquer la validit\u00e9 du r\u00e8glement.\nOn ne peut pas dire non plus que le nouvel art. 5(5) est invalide parce qu\u2019il pr\u00e9tend l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer sur une mati\u00e8re sur laquelle le gouverneur en conseil n\u2019a pas d\u2019autorit\u00e9, mais seulement le Ministre des Transports. Il n\u2019y a pas de doute que sous l\u2019empire de la Loi sur la Radio, le Ministre des Transports, comme \u00e9tant le ministre responsable de l\u2019administration du statut, doit percevoir les droits de licence prescrits par le gouverneur en conseil mais, except\u00e9 en sa qualit\u00e9 de membre de l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif, il n\u2019a aucune autorit\u00e9 pour d\u00e9terminer quel doit \u00eatre le tarif de ces droits.\nLa pr\u00e9tention que le nouvel art. 5 est invalide parce qu\u2019il a un effet r\u00e9troactif, ne peut pas \u00eatre soutenue.

La r\u00e9troactivit\u00e9 de la loi dans notre syst\u00e8me juridique ne peut \u00eatre admise \u00e0 moins que le texte \u00e9dict\u00e9 par le l\u00e9gislateur d\u00e9clare clairement une intention de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer non seulement pour l\u2019avenir, mais \u00e9galement pour le pass\u00e9. Ceci est vrai aussi dans le cas o\u00f9 le l\u00e9gislateur d\u00e9l\u00e8gue ses pouvoirs \u00e0 une organisme subordonn\u00e9. L\u2019article 3(1) de la Loi sur la Radio, qui donne au gouverneur en conseil le pouvoir de prescrire le tarif des droits \u00e0 payer pour les licences, ne parle que pour l\u2019avenir et non pas pour le pass\u00e9. L\u2019arr\u00eat\u00e9 en conseil va donc au-del\u00e0 des pouvoirs qui sont conf\u00e9r\u00e9s au gouverneur en conseil lorsqu\u2019il pr\u00e9tend affecter les droits de licence payables pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e de licence courante.\nLa pr\u00e9tention que ce n\u2019est pas le gouverneur en conseil, mais bien le Ministre des Transports qui seul peut r\u00e9glementer en la mati\u00e8re, ne peut pas \u00eatre accept\u00e9e. L\u2019article 3(1) de la Loi dit que c\u2019est le gouverneur en conseil qui prescrit le tarif des droits \u00e0 payer pour les licences.

Au mois de mars 1960, elle faisait parvenir un ch\u00e8que au montant de $6,000, \u00e0 l\u2019ordre du Receveur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, en paiement des droits de licence \u00e9mise en sa faveur par le Ministre des Transports, pour la p\u00e9riode du 1er avril 1960 au 30 mars 1961.\nCette licence est requise par le Ministre en vertu du r\u00e8glement g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u00e9dict\u00e9 sous l\u2019empire de la Loi sur la Radio, le 25 janvier 1958. L\u2019arr\u00eat\u00e9 en conseil mettant ce r\u00e8glement en vigueur d\u00e9cr\u00e8te que lorsque le revenu brut d\u2019un poste de radio exc\u00e8de le montant de $400,000 par an, le prix du permis annuel est de $6,000. Pour les fins de ce r\u00e8glement les mots \u00abrevenu brut\u00bb signifient le revenu brut du d\u00e9tenteur du permis provenant des op\u00e9rations du poste de radio pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e fiscale se terminant le 31 d\u00e9cembre pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent.\nC\u2019est donc le revenu brut de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 1959 qui doit servir de base pour le prix de la licence du 1er avril 1960 au 30 mars 1961.

Il s\u2019ensuit qu\u2019au lieu de payer $6,000 pour la p\u00e9riode du 1er avril 1960 au 30 mars 1961, l\u2019intim\u00e9e serait tenue de payer pour la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode la somme de $11,452.30. S\u2019autorisant de ce nouvel arr\u00eat\u00e9 en conseil, le minist\u00e8re des Transports a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 cette somme de $5,452.30, le 6 janvier 1961, et apr\u00e8s un \u00e9change de correspondance, o\u00f9 l\u2019intim\u00e9e niait la validit\u00e9 de cette r\u00e9clamation, elle a d\u00e9finitivement pay\u00e9 sous prot\u00eat le 10 mars 1961, quelques jours avant l\u2019expiration de la licence. Le 24 avril 1961, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 ce montant par p\u00e9tition de droit.\nCe litige s\u2019instruisit devant l\u2019honorable Juge Dumoulin de la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier[2], qui accueillit la r\u00e9clamation de la requ\u00e9rante jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence de $5,452.30 avec int\u00e9r\u00eats et d\u00e9pens. C\u2019est de ce jugement que se pourvoit l\u2019appelant devant notre Cour.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9e invoque trois raisons s\u00e9rieuses \u00e0 l\u2019appui de ses pr\u00e9tentions. Elle soutient, en premier lieu, que l\u2019arr\u00eat\u00e9 en conseil du 28 octobre 1960, modifiant l\u2019arr\u00eat\u00e9 en conseil ant\u00e9rieur du 25 janvier 1958, est ill\u00e9gal parce qu\u2019il viole le principe de la non-r\u00e9troactivit\u00e9, qui veut qu\u2019une ordonnance nouvelle ne peut porter atteinte aux droits r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement acquis sous l\u2019empire d\u2019une ancienne ordonnance. Il est certain qu\u2019une loi ne peut avoir d\u2019effet r\u00e9troactif \u00e0 moins que le statut le dise clairement. En droit fran\u00e7ais, comme aussi en droit anglais, on reconna\u00eet ce principe fondamental de justice et d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9. L\u2019article (2) du Code Napol\u00e9on consacre dans un texte cette proposition \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire: \u00abLa loi ne dispose que pour l\u2019avenir, elle n\u2019a point d\u2019effet r\u00e9troactif.\u00bb Dans Craies \u00abOn Statute Law\u00bb (6e \u00e9d., p. 386), et dans \u00abMaxwell on Interpretation of Statutes\u00bb (11e \u00e9d., p. 204), on cite Lord Lindley, Lauri v. Renad[3], qui disait: \u00abIt is a fundamental rule of English law that no statute shall be construed so as to have a retrospective operation, unless its language is such as plainly to require such a construction.\u00bb\nDans Pardo v. Bingham[4], Lord Hatherley disait avec raison:\nThe question is\u2026 secondly, whether on general principles the statute is in this particular section to be held to operate retrospectively, the general rule of law undoubtedly being, that, except there be a clear indication either from the subject matter or from the wording of the statute, the statute is not to receive a retrospective construction.\nMaxwell, vide supra, s\u2019exprime ainsi:\nUpon the presumption that the legislature does not intend what is unjust rests the leaning against giving certain statutes a retrospective operation. Nova constitutio futuris formant imponere debet, non pr\u0153teritis. They are construed as operating only in cases or on facts which come into existence after the statutes were passed unless a retrospective effect be clearly intended.\nLe Code Civil de la province de Qu\u00e9bec ne contient pas de semblable disposition, mais Mignault (vol. 1, p. 66) enseigne que ce principe a \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9 par la jurisprudence. L\u2019auteur s\u2019exprime ainsi: \u00abSi la loi r\u00e9glait le pass\u00e9, si un droit l\u00e9gitimement acquis pouvait \u00eatre ravi, si un acte accompli alors qu\u2019il \u00e9tait licite pouvait ensuite \u00eatre puni, il n\u2019y aurait plus ni libert\u00e9 civile ni s\u00e9curit\u00e9.\u00bb Et les commissaires du Code Civil, commentant l\u2019article (2) du Code Napol\u00e9on, disaient ce qui suit:\nCet article qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 copi\u00e9 du Code Napol\u00e9on (art. 2) a \u00e9t\u00e9 omis, non parce que la r\u00e8gle qu\u2019il consacre est incorrecte ou douteuse, mais parce que l\u2019enonciation en a paru inutile et m\u00eame dangereuse: inutile \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du l\u00e9gislateur, qui aurait toujours droit de ne s\u2019y pas conformer; dangereuse quant au juge, qui pourrait la regarder comme r\u00e9agissant sur le pass\u00e9 et influant sur les nombreuses lois de cette nature, auxquelles, sous cette impression, il refuserait, quoiqu\u2019\u00e0 tort, de donner effet.\nD\u2019apr\u00e8s les discussions qui ont eu lieu en France sur cet article, l\u2019on voit qu\u2019il n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 admis que parce que l\u2019on n\u2019avait pas \u00e0 craindre l\u00e0 le m\u00eame inconv\u00e9nient quant aux lois ant\u00e9rieures.\nIl ne peut donc y avoir de doutes qu\u2019en vertu des diff\u00e9rents syst\u00e8mes de droit, qui r\u00e9gissent les citoyens du pays, la r\u00e9troactivit\u00e9 des lois dans notre syst\u00e8me juridique ne peut \u00eatre admise \u00e0 moins que le texte \u00e9dict\u00e9 par le l\u00e9gislateur d\u00e9clare clairement une intention de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer non seulement pour l\u2019avenir, mais \u00e9galement pour le pass\u00e9. On peut ajouter aussi que le l\u00e9gislateur qui d\u00e9l\u00e8gue ses pouvoirs \u00e0 un organisme subordonn\u00e9 peut aussi autoriser, mais \u00e9galement sans ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 ni \u00e9quivoque, de se d\u00e9partir du principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la non\u2011r\u00e9troactivit\u00e9 et d\u2019affecter ainsi les droits ant\u00e9rieurs acquis. Ces principes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnus par Sir Lyman Duff dans l\u2019affaire de Spooner Oils Limited v. Turner Valley Gas Conservation Board[5]. Voici comment il s\u2019exprimait:\nA legislative enactment is not to be read as prejudicially affecting accrued rights, or an existing status, unless the language in which it is expressed requires such a construction. The rule is described by Coke as a law of Parliament, meaning, no doubt, that it is a rule based on the practice of Parliament; the underlying assumption being that, when Parliament intends prejudicially to affect such rights or such a status, it declares its intention expressly, unless, at all events, that intention is plainly manifested by unavoidable inference.\nDans le cas pr\u00e9sent, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a obtenu sa licence pour une p\u00e9riode de douze mois, soit du 1er avril 1960 au 30 mars 1961. Comme je l\u2019ai dit d\u00e9j\u00e0, elle avait ant\u00e9rieurement pay\u00e9 pour ce permis d\u2019exploitation la somme de $6,000 r\u00e9clam\u00e9e par le minist\u00e8re. C\u2019\u00e9tait le seul montant qu\u2019elle pouvait avec raison s\u2019attendre \u00e0 payer pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e courante et il est juste, je crois, de penser que son budget a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9 en cons\u00e9quence, et ce n\u2019est qu\u2019au d\u00e9but de janvier qu\u2019on a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 la somme additionnelle de $5,452.30, pay\u00e9e le 10 mars 1961, soit un an apr\u00e8s le paiement de la premi\u00e8re somme de $6,000.\nEn vertu de la Loi sur la radio au Canada,\n3.(1) Le gouverneur en conseil peut\na) prescrire le tarif des droits \u00e0 payer pour les licences et pour l\u2019examen relatif aux certificats de capacit\u00e9 d\u00e9tenus et \u00e9mis en vertu de la pr\u00e9sente loi;\nMais le gouverneur en conseil tient ses pouvoirs de la l\u00e9gislation sur la radio, adopt\u00e9e par le Parlement. Cette loi aurait pu, sans doute, d\u00e9cr\u00e9ter que le gouverneur en conseil serait investi de l\u2019autorit\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire pour d\u00e9clarer la r\u00e9troactivit\u00e9 de certains des r\u00e8glements qu\u2019il est autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9tablir. Cependant, nulle part voit-on dans la loi que le gouverneur en conseil peut r\u00e9glementer le pass\u00e9.\nDans son factum et \u00e0 l\u2019audition, le procureur de l\u2019appelant nous dit que les termes de l\u2019article 3(1), supra, de la Loi sur la radio ont une port\u00e9e tr\u00e8s vaste; il n\u2019y a, dit-il, aucune restriction impos\u00e9e \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence attribu\u00e9e au gouverneur en conseil, et le Parlement lui a d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 tous les pouvoirs qui \u00e9taient siens en ce domaine sp\u00e9cifique de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement d\u2019un tarif. L\u2019appelant fait observer que si le gouverneur en conseil a agi dans les limites des pouvoirs que lui a conf\u00e9r\u00e9s le Parlement, il n\u2019appartient pas aux tribunaux de consid\u00e9rer la sagesse ni m\u00eame l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 de la mesure qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise.\nJe ne peux m\u2019accorder avec cette proposition qui veut dire que la r\u00e9troactivit\u00e9 des r\u00e8glements existe, \u00e0 moins que le Parlement ait \u00e9dict\u00e9 que seul l\u2019avenir serait affect\u00e9. C\u2019est le contraire qui est vrai, et la r\u00e9troactivit\u00e9 n\u2019existe pas \u00e0 moins que l\u2019autorit\u00e9 comp\u00e9tente l\u2019autorise. Aucun texte de cette nature ne se trouve dans le cas qui nous occupe. Il me faut donc conclure que l\u2019article 3(1) ne parle que pour l\u2019avenir et non pour le pass\u00e9. L\u2019arr\u00eat\u00e9 en conseil va donc au\u2011del\u00e0 des pouvoirs qui sont conf\u00e9r\u00e9s au gouverneur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral en conseil quand, le 28 octobre 1960, il pr\u00e9tend augmenter les tarifs pour la p\u00e9riode du 1er avril 1960 au 30 mars 1961. Il s\u2019agit ici d\u2019un cas clair de d\u00e9l\u00e9gation de pouvoirs, et le subordonn\u00e9 doit donc demeurer dans les limites strictes de l\u2019autorit\u00e9 que le Parlement lui a conf\u00e9r\u00e9e.\nDevant la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier et devant cette Cour, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a pr\u00e9tendu que ce n\u2019est pas le gouverneur en conseil, mais bien le ministre des Transports, qui seul pouvait r\u00e9glementer ce qui fait l\u2019objet du pr\u00e9sent litige. Il est certain que le ministre des Transports a une grande autorit\u00e9 en ce qui a trait aux licences de radio en vertu de l\u2019article 4(1) de la Loi, mais l\u2019article 3(1) de la m\u00eame loi dit que c\u2019est le gouverneur en conseil qui prescrit le tarif des droits \u00e0 payer pour les licences. Si j\u2019acceptais la pr\u00e9tention de l\u2019intim\u00e9e sur ce point, il me faudrait mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 l\u2019article 3(1), ce que je ne peux certainement pas faire.\nSi la th\u00e9orie de l\u2019intim\u00e9e est fond\u00e9e, elle doit n\u00e9cessairement s\u2019appuyer sur l\u2019article 10 de la Loi sur la radio, qui voudrait dire que lorsqu\u2019il y a violation de la Loi, l\u2019\u00e9quipement peut \u00eatre confisqu\u00e9, et implicitement le retrait de la licence, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de paiement du prix, peut \u00eatre exig\u00e9. On pr\u00e9tend que l\u2019ill\u00e9galit\u00e9 na\u00eetrait du fait que l\u2019intervention du gouverneur en conseil mettrait un terme \u00e0 la dur\u00e9e de la licence, terme qui doit \u00eatre d\u00e9termin\u00e9 par le ministre des Transports seul.\nJe ne vois pas d\u2019empi\u00e8tement par le gouverneur en conseil sur les pr\u00e9rogatives du ministre des Transports. Le gouverneur en conseil tient son autorit\u00e9 de l\u2019article 3, et l\u2019article 10 est le texte de la loi qui impose la p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de paiement. C\u2019est la loi elle-m\u00eame qui limite les pouvoirs du ministre des Transports et non pas un acte arbitraire de la part du gouverneur en conseil.\nNous n\u2019avons qu\u2019\u00e0 d\u00e9terminer la question de savoir si le prix de la licence peut \u00eatre major\u00e9 pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 1960-61 comme il l\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9. La cons\u00e9quence de cette r\u00e9troactivit\u00e9 donn\u00e9e par le gouverneur en conseil \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat\u00e9 minist\u00e9riel du 28 octobre 1960 rend ce dernier inop\u00e9rant, et me dispense de discuter les autres questions qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9es. L\u2019appelant nous y invite d\u2019ailleurs lorsqu\u2019il dit dans son factum qu\u2019\u00e0 strictement parler l\u2019appel ne repose que sur cette partie du jugement qui, d\u00e9clarant que l\u2019arr\u00eat\u00e9 en conseil dont il s\u2019agit a un effet r\u00e9troactif que la loi n\u2019autorise pas, conduit \u00e0 la conclusion qu\u2019il y a empi\u00e8tement sur les pouvoirs du ministre des Transports.\nJe suis donc d\u2019opinion que cet appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nThe judgment of Fauteux, Abbott and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nABBOTT J.:\u2014The sole question at issue in this appeal is the validity of Order in Council P.C. 1960-1488, passed under the provisions of s. 3 of the Radio Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 233, as amended. That Order in Council rescinded s. 5 of the \u201cGeneral Radio Regulations\u201d then in force, and replaced it with a new section. The said section prescribed the fees payable by private commercial broadcasting stations licensed under the Radio Act.\nThe relevant facts are not in dispute. Respondent is a corporation which for many years has operated a private commercial radio broadcasting station in the city of Montreal whose call letters are CKAC with a power of 50,000 watts on a frequency of 730 kilocycles. It has been licensed to do so by a series of annual licences issued by the Minister of Transport under the provisions of the Radio Act. Unless otherwise provided, such licences are granted on an annual basis for a period running from April 1 to March 31. Licence fees payable by private commercial broadcasting stations have varied from time to time over the years, but for some time prior to October 1960 the fees payable by respondent were the maximum then provided for of $6,000 per year.\nOn October 28, 1960, Order in Council P.C. 1960-1488 was adopted, which amended the Regulations then in force, by repealing s. 5 of the said regulations which prescribed the licence fees payable by private commercial radio stations, and replacing it by a new s. 5 providing for a scale of licence fees calculated on a different basis than the one provided for in the earlier regulation.\nThe effect of the new regulation was to increase the licence fee payable by respondent for the then current licence year from $6,000 to $11,452.30.\nOn January 6, 1961, the Department of Transport claimed from respondent, as additional licence fees for the then current year, the sum of $5,452.30. Payment was refused by respondent, but after discussions which took place with officials of the Department, the amount claimed was paid under protest. By its petition of right filed April 24, 1961, alleging the invalidity of the said Order in Council of October 28, 1960, respondent claimed reimbursement of the said sum of $5,452.30 with interest and costs. In its petition of right and before this court, respondent submitted that s. 5 of the General Radio Regulations as enacted by Order in Council P.C. 1960-1488 was invalid and ultra vires in the following respects:\n1. That it does not prescribe a licence fee but in fact and in law creates and imposes a tax without Parliamentary sanction or approval. 2. That it is unjust and discriminatory between the respondent and other private commercial broadcasting stations and also between a group of private commercial radio broadcasting stations, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and other categories of broadcasting stations.\n3. That it affects the rights of respondent and others affected thereby in a retroactive manner not authorized by the enabling legislation.\n4. That it was beyond the authority of the Governor-in-Council and in the form in which it was passed infringed on the exclusive authority of the Minister of Transport.\nMr. Justice Dumoulin of the Exchequer Court[6] held that the said s. 5 was invalid and ultra vires in that it was beyond the power of the Governor in Council to increase licence fees during the currency of a licensing period since the exercise of this power infringed on authority reserved exclusively to the Minister of Transport under the Radio Act. He appears also to have been of opinion that the by-law illegally had a retroactive effect, but he rejected the other grounds of alleged illegality raised by respondent. He recommended repayment to respondent of the sum of $5,452.30 with interest.\nAppellant appealed from that judgment to this Court and respondent cross-appealed on the ground that the learned trial judge should have declared the Order in Council invalid on grounds 1, 2 and 3 which I have enumerated. As a result all the grounds of alleged invalidity raised in the Court of first instance were argued before this Court.\nThe relevant portions of Order in Council P.C. 1960-1488 read as follows:\n1. Section 5 of the General Radio Regulations, Part I is revoked and the following substituted therefore:\n5. (1) In this section,\n(a) \u201cgross revenue\u201d, in relation to any licensee, means the gross revenue of the licensee derived from the operation of the station, less agency commissions, and\n(b) \u201clicence year\u201d, as applied to any Private Commercial Broadcasting Station, means a twelve-month period commencing April 1st and ending March 31st following, during which the licence issued for that station is in force. (2) Subject to this section, the licence fee for a Private Commercial Broadcasting Station for each licence year is payable on or before the commencement of the licence year.\n(3) Subject to this section, the licence fee for a Private Commercial Broadcasting Station for each licence year shall be based upon the gross revenue of the licensee for the fiscal year of the station ending on or before the 31st day of December immediately preceding the commencement of the licence year as follows:\n(a) if the gross revenue is $200,000 or less, the fee is one per cent of the gross revenue, and\n(b) if the gross revenue exceeds $200,000, the fee is $2000 plus one and one-half per cent of the gross revenue in excess of $200,000.\n(4) Notwithstanding subsection (3) and subject to subsections (9) and (10), the minimum licence fee for each licence year for a Private Commercial Broadcasting Station is $100.\n(5) If the licence fee for the licence year 1960-61 for an existing Private Commercial Broadcasting Station, computed in accordance with subsection (3) exceeds that which would have been payable under the schedule of licence fees in force on March 31st, 1960, then the licence fee for the licence year 1960-61, is one-half the sum of\n(a) the amount of the licence fee which would have been payable under the said schedule of licence fees in force on March 31st, 1960, and\n(b) the amount computed in accordance with subsection (3).\nThe statutory authority for the adoption of such Order in Council is contained in s. 3 of the Radio Act, the relevant portions of which read\n3. (1) The Governor in Council may\n(a) prescribe the tariff of fees to be paid for licences and for examination for certificates of proficiency held and issued under this Act;\u2026\n(2) Any person who violates any regulation made under this section for which no penalty is provided is liable upon summary conviction to a penalty not exceeding fifty dollars and costs or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months.\nI shall deal first with the questions raised on cross-appeal. The learned trial judge held to be unfounded respondent\u2019s contentions that s. 5 of the Radio Regulations as enacted by the Order in Council was invalid because (1) it imposed a tax and not a licence fee and (2) was unjust and discriminatory. I am in agreement with that view and have little to add to what the learned trial judge has said on these two points. The operator of a private commercial broadcasting station is required under the Radio Act to be in possession of a licence issued by the Minister of Transport. The holding of such a licence involves the obligation to pay licence fees as prescribed by the Governor in Council. As I have stated, the tariff of such licence fees has been varied from time to time over the years. The tariff established under P.C. 1960-1488 abolished a previously existing maximum fee and provided for licence fees calculated upon the basis of gross revenues of the licencee. In my view this is no way changed the character of the levy. As to the alleged discriminatory character of the regulation, I am not satisfied that it is in fact discriminatory. In any event s. 3 of the Act puts no limitation upon the powers of the Governor in Council to prescribe licence fees. That such fees may in fact be discriminatory, in my opinion, affords no legal ground of attack upon the validity of the Order.\nDealing now with the appeal itself. The learned trial judge, although he referred to respondent\u2019s contention that the Order in Council was invalid because of its alleged retroactive effect, did not explicitly found his judgment upon that point. He held that subs. 5 of s. 5 of the Radio Regulations as enacted by Order in Council P.C. 1960-1488 was invalid for the following reasons:\nEn bref, le paragraphe (5) de l\u2019article 5 susdit me para\u00eet entach\u00e9 de nullit\u00e9 moins \u00e0 cause de sa r\u00e9troactivit\u00e9, que, parce qu\u2019il entend statuer en une mati\u00e8re sur laquelle son auteur, le gouverneur en conseil, n\u2019aurait pas autorit\u00e9, mais le ministre des Transports seulement.\nWith respect, I am unable to agree with that finding. Under s. 4 of the Radio Act, exclusive authority concerning the issue of licences is given to the Minister of Transport. Under s. 3 of the said Act exclusive authority to prescribe the tariff of fees to be paid for such licences is given to the Governor in Council. In the one case an administrative discretion has been granted and in the other case an authority to legislate. The Minister of Transport, as the minister responsible for the administration of the Radio Act, is no doubt required to collect the licence fees prescribed by the Governor in Council but, except in his capacity as one member of the executive branch of government, he has no authority to determine what the tariff of such fees should be.\nI shall now deal with respondent\u2019s contention that the Order in Council was invalid because of its alleged retroactive effect. The so-called rule of non-retroactivity is of course a well established rule of interpretation that generally speaking, a law is not to be interpreted as having a retroactive effect unless it contains express words or there is the plainest implication to the contrary effect\u2014see Maxwell v. Callbeck[7].\nIn the present case, as I have stated, respondent held a valid licence to operate for the licence year April 1, 1960 to March 31, 1961, a private commercial broadcasting station and to use a certain specified radio frequency for that purpose. As Lord Atkin stated in Shannon v. Lower Mainland Dairy Products Board[8], such a licence merely involves a permission to trade, subject to compliance with certain conditions. In the present case, there was no contractual relationship between the Crown and respondent, and the latter had no vested or property right in the licence which it held. What it did have was a privilege granted by the state, conferring authority to do something which without such permission would be illegal.\nThe Order in Council clearly was intended to affect the licence fees payable for the then current licence year. From the terms of subs. 5 of the new s. 5, however, it is also clear, that fees were calculated for that year on the old basis with respect to the first six months and on the new basis with respect to the last six months.\nIf the Order did have retroactive effect, (as to which I do not find it necessary to express any opinion) s. 3 of the Radio Act contains no limitation upon the power of the Governor in Council to make such an order. In view of the nature of the right held by a person licensed to operate a private commercial broadcasting station, I am of opinion that the Governor in Council can validly increase or decrease the fees payable by such a licensee at any time during the currency of the licence. As I have said, Order in Council P.C. 1960-1488 clearly expressed an intention to do so.\nFor the foregoing reasons, I would allow the appeal and dismiss the petition of right with costs here and in the Exchequer Court. The cross appeal should also be dismissed with costs.\nHALL J.:\u2014I agree with His Lordship the Chief Justice that the Order in Council in this appeal was retroactive legislation. The Order in Council, however, was validly enacted under the power given the Governor in Council by the Radio Act and it clearly expresses the retroactive effect it was intended to achieve. I concur, therefore, in the appeal being disposed of as proposed by my brother Abbott.\nAppeal allowed and cross-appeal dismissed, with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: R. B\u00e9dard, Ottawa.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Gowling, MacTavish, Osborne & Henderson, Ottawa.\n[1] [1964] Ex. C.R. 627.\n[2] [1964] Ex.

Dennision et al., [1967] S.C.R. 7\nDate: 1966-11-21\nVeatrice Kathleen Swain, Violet Irene Chadwick and Vivian Wilfred Woods (Petitioners) Appellants;\nand\nVimy Ridge Dennison and Victoria Margaret Hislop (Respondents) Respondents.\n1966: November 2, 3; 1966: November 21.\nPresent: Cartwright, Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nWills\u2014Applications made under Testator\u2019s Family Maintenance Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 378, to vary will\u2014Discretion of Court\u2014Whether Court of Appeal erred in substituting its own discretion for that of trial judge.\nThe testatrix, whose estate had a probable value of some $120,000, by her will bequeathed three legacies; namely, $300 to her daughter S, $200 to a friend B and $2,000 to a grandchild, the daughter of S. One third of the remainder was given to a daughter D, and one third to a daughter H. The remaining one third was to provide for the above legacies, and the balance to be held in trust as a life estate for the testatrix\u2019s son W, so long as such balance did not exceed one quarter of the whole estate. Any excess over such one quarter was to be divided equally among D, H and another daughter C. After the fulfilment of the life estate, the remainder of this one third was to be divided equally among the same three daughters.\nThe appellants, S and C, and the cross-appellant, W, made application under the Testator\u2019s Family Maintenance Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 378, for a larger provision in their mother\u2019s estate than they had been allowed under her will. The trial judge exercised his discretion by directing that, after providing for the legacies to B and the daughter of S, the estate should be divided equally among the five children of the testatrix.\nFrom this decision the present respondents appealed. The Court of Appeal, unanimously, directed that S and C should each receive the sum of $10,000 in addition to the benefits they received under the terms of the will. This total of $20,000 would be paid ratably out of the benefits received by each of the five children under the terms of the will.\nFrom this judgment the appellants S and C appealed and the other three parties cross\u2011appealed. S and C contended that the decision at trial should be restored; D and H sought restoration of the terms of the will. W supported the submission of the appellants, or, in the alternative the restoration of the will.\nHeld: The appeals and cross-appeals should be dismissed. The contention that the Court of Appeal had erred in substituting its own discretion for that of the trial judge failed. The entire jurisdiction of the trial judge under the Act in question was discretionary in character. Any person who considered himself prejudicially affected by the discretion exercised by the trial judge had a right to appeal. Consequently, the Act must have contemplated a review of that discretion by the Court of Appeal. It was held, therefore, that that Court had the power and the duty to review the circumstances and reach its own conclusion as to the discretion properly to be exercised.\nIn any event, in the present case the Court of Appeal was of the opinion that the trial judge had failed to give sufficient weight to relevant considerations and had disregarded principle. This Court agreed with the comments of the Court of Appeal in respect of the judgment at trial and, for that reason, would not restore that judgment.\nWith respect to the contention that the terms of the will should be restored, there were concurrent findings in the Courts below that the testatrix did not make adequate provision in her will for the maintenance and support of S and C. This Court would not, on the evidence, reverse that finding. No reason found to be persuasive was advanced to warrant this Court altering the order of the Court of Appeal in respect of the provision to be made for them in addition to what they each received under the terms of the will. Furthermore, the Court was not prepared to alter the findings of the Court of Appeal with respect to W.\nAppeals\u2014Judgment at trial and that on appeal involving exercise of judicial discretion\u2014Appeal brought without leave\u2014Jurisdiction of Supreme Court of Canada\u2014Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 259, ss. 41, 44.\nIn view of s. 44 of the Supreme Court Act, where it is provided by subs. (1) that no appeal \u201clies to the Supreme Court from a judgment or order made in the exercise of judicial discretion except in proceedings in the nature of a suit or proceedings in equity\u2026\u201d, this appeal was one which could only be brought with leave granted pursuant to s. 41. The submission that the proceedings were in the nature of a suit or proceedings in equity in view of the fact that s. 3(1) of the Testator\u2019s Family Maintenance Act empowered the Court to order such provision \u201cas the Court thinks adequate, just, and equitable in the circumstances\u201d was not accepted. The jurisdiction conferred upon the Court by s. 3(1) was a statutory jurisdiction giving the power to exercise a statutory discretion. When s. 44(1) referred to \u201ca suit or proceedings in equity\u201d it was referring to that kind of suit or proceedings which, in England, prior to the enactment of The Judicature Act, 1873, would have been commenced in a court of equity. (Carnochan v. Carnochan, [1955] S.C.R. 669, referred to.) Leave to bring the present appeal had not been obtained. However, counsel having relied on Walker v. McDermott, [1931] S.C.R. 94, and In re Jones, McCarvill v. Jones et al., [1962] S.C.R. 273, two cases where the Court had considered appeals from judgments made pursuant to the provisions of the Testator\u2019s Family Maintenance Act without prior leave having been granted, although the requirement for leave to appeal did not appear to have been raised or considered in either case, it was decided to grant leave to bring this appeal. APPEALS and CROSS-APPEALS from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia1, which set aside and varied the judgment of Nemetz J. in respect of certain applications made under the Testator\u2019s Family Maintenance Act. Appeals and cross\u2011appeals dismissed.\nFrank G.P. Lewis, for the appellant, V.K. Swain.\nRobert J. Brennan, for the appellant, V.I. Chadwick.\nDavid Sigler, Q.C., for the cross-appellant, V.W. Woods.\nB.W.F. McLoughlin, for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], which set aside and varied the judgment of the learned trial judge in respect of applications made under the Testator\u2019s Family Maintenance Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 378, in respect of the estate of Emma Woods.\nThe provisions of that statute, which are relevant, are as follows:\n3. (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of any law or Statute to the contrary, if any person (hereinafter called the \u201ctestator\u201d) dies leaving a will and without making therein, in the opinion of the Judge before whom the application is made, adequate provision for the proper maintenance and support of the testator\u2019s wife, husband, or children, the Court may, in its discretion, on the application by or on behalf of the wife, or of the husband, or of a child or children, order that such provision as the Court thinks adequate, just, and equitable in the circumstances shall be made out of the estate of the testator for the wife, husband, or children.\n* * *\n17. From any order made under this Act a party deeming himself prejudicially affected may appeal to the Court of Appeal within the same time and the same manner as from a final judgment of the Court in a civil cause.\nThe appeal was brought before this Court without leave having been obtained under s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 259, and at the commencement of the argument counsel were requested to make their submissions as to whether, without such leave, an appeal could be brought in view of the provisions of s. 44, which provides:\n44. (1) No appeal lies to the Supreme Court from a judgment or order made in the exercise of judicial discretion except in proceedings in the nature of a suit or proceedings in equity originating elsewhere than in the Province of Quebec and except in mandamus proceedings.\n(2) This section does not apply to an appeal under section 41.\nIt was not contested, in argument, that both the judgment at trial and that on appeal involved the exercise of judicial discretion, but it was contended by counsel for the appellants that the proceedings were in the nature of a suit or proceedings in equity, in view of the fact that s. 3(1) of the Testator\u2019s Family Maintenance Act empowered the Court to order such provision \u201cas the Court thinks adequate, just, and equitable in the circumstances\u201d. (The italics are mine.)\nI do not agree with this submission. The jurisdiction conferred upon the Court by s. 3(1) is a statutory jurisdiction giving the power to exercise a statutory discretion. When s. 44(1) refers to \u201ca suit or proceedings in equity\u201d it is referring to that kind of suit or proceeding which, in England, prior to the enactment of The Judicature Act, 1873, would have been commenced in a court of equity.\nThis question was considered by Cartwright J., who delivered the judgment of the Court, in Carnochan v. Carnochan[2], at p. 674:\nI conclude that the judgment of Schroeder J. in the case at bar was \u201ca judgment or order made in the exercise of judicial discretion\u201d.\nIt is next necessary to inquire whether it was made \u201cin proceedings in the nature of a suit or proceeding in equity\u201d. In my opinion it was not. The judgments of Kellock J.A., as he then was, and of Laidlaw J.A. in H. v. H., [1944] O.R. 438; 4 D.L.R. 173, set out the history of the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Ontario to grant alimony and shew that it was formerly exercised in the Court of Chancery; but in the case at bar the learned trial judge was not, I think, exercising the jurisdiction formerly exercised by that Court or one which he would have possessed, apart from statute, in a proceeding in equity, but rather a statutory jurisdiction conferred upon him by s. 12 calling upon him in the circumstances of this case, in the exercise of his discretion to make such order as he saw fit. That in making such order the learned judge was called upon to exercise his discretion judicially goes without saying and was fully recognized by him.\nFor these reasons I am of opinion that the judgment of the learned trial judge in regard to issue (a) was one as to which under the terms of s. 44 of the Supreme Court Act no appeal lies to this Court.\nThe present appeal is, therefore, one which could only be brought with leave granted pursuant to s. 41.\nIn the course of argument it was pointed out that this Court had considered two appeals from judgments made pursuant to the provisions of the Testator\u2019s Family Maintenance Act without prior leave having been granted (Walker v. McDermott[3] and In re Jones, McCarvill v. Jones et al.[4]). Counsel for the appellants, in preparing this appeal, had, quite naturally, relied upon these authorities in reaching the conclusion that leave to appeal was not necessary. The requirement for leave to appeal does not appear to have been raised or considered in either of those cases. However, in view of counsel\u2019s reliance upon those cases, it was decided to grant leave to bring the present appeal.\nThis case involves the will of Emma Woods, who had been the sole beneficiary under the will of her husband, who predeceased her, and who was at the time of her death enabled to dispose of the whole of the family estate, which, we were advised, would probably have a value of some $120,000. The parties to the proceedings are five of her children, four daughters and one son. Another son had been given a life estate under the will, but died during the course of the proceedings.\nUnder the will three legacies had been bequeathed; namely, $300 to the appellant daughter, Mrs. Swain, $200 to a friend of the testatrix, Mrs. Bradley, and $2,000 to Mrs. Swain\u2019s daughter, Virginia Nash.\nOne third of the remainder was given to the respondent Mrs. Dennison, and one third to the respondent Mrs. Hislop. The remaining one third was to provide for the legacies above mentioned, and the balance to be held in trust as a life estate for the son Vivian Woods, so long as such balance did not exceed one quarter of the whole estate. Any excess over such one quarter was to be divided equally among Mrs. Dennison, Mrs. Hislop and the appellant Mrs. Chadwick. After the fulfilment of the life estate, the remainder of this one third portion was to be divided equally among the same three daughters.\nThe proceedings under the Act were commenced by Mrs. Swain, and, subsequently, Vivian Woods and Mrs. Chadwick filed affidavits to support claims for benefits from the estate in excess of those provided for them by the will.\nThe learned trial judge exercised his discretion by directing that, after providing for the legacies to Mrs. Bradley and Virginia Nash, the estate should be divided equally among the five children of Mrs. Emma Woods. From this decision the present respondents appealed. The Court of Appeal, unanimously, directed that Mrs. Swain and Mrs. Chadwick should each receive the sum of $10,000 in addition to the benefits they received under the terms of the will This total of $20,000 would be paid ratably out of the benefits received by each of the five children under the terms of the will.\nFrom this judgment the appellants Mrs. Swain and Mrs. Chadwick have appealed and the other three parties have cross-appealed.\nThe only issue of law raised by the appellants and by Vivian Woods was that the Court of Appeal had erred in substituting its own discretion for that of the trial judge. It was contended, on the authority of Evans v. Bartlam[5], Charles Osenton & Co. v. Johnston[6], and Blunt v. Blunt[7], that an appellate court should not interfere with the exercise of a discretion by a trial judge unless clearly of the opinion that he had acted on a wrong principle; wrongly exercised his discretion, in the sense that no sufficient weight had been given to relevant considerations; or that on other grounds the decision might result in injustice.\nIn my opinion, in view of the special nature of the provisions of the Act in question and the specific right of appeal which it confers, it is not proper to impose any fetters on the powers of the Court of Appeal in considering appeals under this Act. The entire jurisdiction of the trial judge under this statute is discretionary in character. The relief which may be granted under it is completely dependent on his opinion, first, as to whether adequate provision for proper maintenance and support has been provided for the spouse and children under the will, and second, if adequate provision is not thought to be made, as to what provision should be made. Notwithstanding this, the Act, by s. 14, gives to any party deeming himself to be prejudicially affected, a right to appeal. I construe s. 14 as meaning that any person who considers himself prejudicially affected by the discretion exercised by the trial judge has a right to appeal, and, in consequence, the Act must contemplate a review of that discretion by the Court of Appeal. This being so, that Court has the power and the duty to review the circumstances and reach its own conclusion as to the discretion properly to be exercised.\nIn any event, in the present case the Court of Appeal was of the opinion that the learned trial judge had failed to give sufficient weight to relevant considerations and had disregarded principle. Bull J.A., who delivered, the judgment of the Court, said:\nWith respect, I am of the view that he was wrong in concluding that everyone\u2019s entitlements were equal. In my opinion he failed to give due consideration to the circumstances of the appellants and their claims in the estate. By failing so to do he disregarded the principle that so long as a proper and just provision is made for each, a testator may prefer one child or more over others: In re Testator\u2019s Family Maintenance Act; in re Dawson Estate (1945) 61 B.C.R. 481; here the testatrix had some very definite preferences and by treating all children alike, rather than to interfere only to the extent necessary to right the wrong found, comes very close indeed to the making of a new will for the testatrix rather than remedying the fault of the old: In re The Testator\u2019s Family Maintenance Act, In re Gill Estate [1941] 3 W.W.R. 888.\nMost of the argument before us, on behalf of each of the parties, was in respect of the merits of the case. The appellants Mrs. Swain and Mrs. Chadwick contended that the decision at trial should be restored. The respondents Mrs. Dennison and Mrs. Hislop sought the restoration of the terms of the will. Vivian Woods supported the submission of the appellants, or, in the alternative, the restoration of the will. The respective moral claims of each of the parties have been reviewed in the reasons for judgment of the Courts below. In view of the conclusions I have reached, it is unnecessary to review them here.\nI have already cited the comments of the Court of Appeal in respect of the judgment at trial. I agree with them and, for that reason, would not be prepared to restore that judgment.\nWith respect to the contention that the terms of the will should be restored, there are concurrent findings in the Courts below that the testatrix did not make adequate provision in her will for the maintenance and support of Mrs. Swain and Mrs. Chadwick. I would not, on the evidence, reverse that finding. No reason which I found persuasive was advanced to warrant this Court altering the order of the Court of Appeal in respect of the provision to be made for them in addition to what they each receive under the terms of the will. Furthermore, I am not prepared to alter the findings of that Court with respect to Vivian Woods.\nIn the result, therefore, I would dismiss each of the appeals, and each of the cross-appeals. In the circumstances, I think that each of the parties should be responsible for his or her own costs.\nAppeals and cross-appeals dismissed.\nSolicitors for the appellant, V.K.

(Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1966: November 3, 25.\nPresent: Cartwright, Abbott, Martland, Ritchie and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nGuarantee\u2014Promissory notes\u2014Whether notes covered by guarantee\u2014Knowledge of guarantor as to intent of guarantee.\nIn an action involving six promissory notes, the respondent company, which claimed against the appellant as guarantor, was awarded judgment for $19,844.99. An appeal to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia having been dismissed, a further appeal was brought to this Court. At the conclusion of the argument for the appellant, the Court stated that reply was required in reference only to the appellant\u2019s sixth submission which appeared in his factum in these words: \u201cThat alternatively if the guarantee is held to be valid that the promissory notes as transactions inter partes which are the subject of this action were not promissory notes contemplated by the guarantee.\u201d The trial judge had found that when the appellant executed the guarantee he knew that it covered the repayment of moneys advanced or credited by the respondent for new and used wholesale financing. The Court of Appeal supported that finding.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nWhether the word \u201cpurchased\u201d or the word \u201cdiscounted\u201d applied to the promissory notes in question, the phrase in the guarantee \u201cof any and all notes, bills of exchange, agreements, contracts or acceptances now held or which may hereafter be purchased or discounted by the corporation\u201d was broad enough to cover the said promissory notes and in the light of the concurrent findings of fact of the Courts below it was intended to cover the said notes.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Hutcheson J. Appeal dismissed.\nF.G.P. Lewis, for the defendant, appellant.\nG.T. Guest, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nSPENCE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia which dismissed with costs an appeal from the judgment of Hutcheson J. whereby he awarded the plaintiff the sum of $19,844.99 plus costs. That amount was the total due on six promissory-notes made by Steveston Motors Limited in favour of Imperial Investment Corporation Limited. The latter has now become the respondent Laurentide Financial Corporation Limited which claimed against the appellant as guarantor.\nAfter presentation of the argument by counsel for the appellant, the Court informed counsel for the respondent that reply was required in reference only to the sixth submission of the appellant. That submission appeared in the appellant\u2019s factum in these words:\nThat alternatively if the guarantee is held to be valid that the promissory notes as transactions inter partes which are the subject of this action were not promissory notes contemplated by the guarantee.\nThe guarantee upon which the plaintiff (here respondent) based its claim was one under date of November 19, 1956. The material part of the guarantee reads as follows:\nIn consideration of the purchase or discount of any note, bill of exchange, agreement, contract or acceptance bearing the signature in any capacity of Steveston Motors Ltd. of Steveston, B.C., hereinafter called the Dealer by the Imperial Investment Corporation Ltd., hereinafter called the Corporation, the undersigned do hereby jointly and severally unconditionally guarantee to the Corporation the payment at maturity or whenever by the terms of said note, bill of exchange, agreement, contract or acceptance, the same shall become or be declared to be due, of any and all notes, bills of exchange, agreements, contracts or acceptances, now held or which may hereafter be purchased or discounted by the Corporation, on which the Dealer is or may become liable as maker, drawer, acceptor, indorser, signatory or guarantor\u2026\n(The italics are my own.)\nThe learned trial judge made a specific finding of fact: \u201cI find that when the defendant executed the guarantee sued upon he knew that it covered the repayment of moneys advanced or credited by the plaintiff for new and used wholesale financing.\u201d\nDavey J.A., in giving the judgment for the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, said:\nThe learned trial judge found appellant knew when he signed the document that it was a guarantee of the dealer\u2019s obligations for wholesale financing\u2026. I am unable to say the learned Judge was wrong and this ground of appeal fails.\nTherefore, we have concurrent findings of fact that the guarantee was intended to cover new and used wholesale financing. As Davey J.A. points out in his reasons for judgment for the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, \u201cused wholesale financing, which the guarantee was intended to cover, consisted principally of money loaned directly to the dealer and the word \u2018discount\u2019 was undoubtedly intended to apply to that type of transaction.\u201d\nOn full consideration of the matter, we have come to the conclusion that whether the word \u201cpurchased\u201d or the word \u201cdiscounted\u201d applied to these promissory notes of Steveston Motors Limited, the phrase \u201cof any and all notes, bills of exchange, agreements, contracts or acceptances now held or which may hereafter be purchased or discounted by the corporation\u201d is broad enough to cover the said promissory notes and in the light of the concurrent findings of fact made by the Courts below upon the circumstances outlined in the evidence it was intended to cover the said promissory notes.\nThe appeal will be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Griffiths, McLelland & Co., Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: Robson, Macdonald & Guest, Vancouver.\n"}

T had arranged to buy the land in the name of a nominee. The owner of an abutting property and her husband brought an action for a declaration that the by-law and the sale of the closed road thereby authorized were null and void and for an order setting aside the sale. The trial judge dismissed the action. The Court of Appeal in reversing this judgment held that non\u2011compliance with s. 477 of The Municipal Act results in a void transaction. They also held that in this particular case the conduct of T was fraudulent. They set aside that part of the by\u2011law which authorized the sale and declared the deed of conveyance to be null and void. T appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe Court agreed with the judgment of the Court of Appeal that if the provisions of s. 477 of The Municipal Act are not observed, the council is without authority and a by-law authorizing sale is void and is open to attack notwithstanding that more than a year has elapsed from the date of its passing. The council was under no compulsion to sell, but if it determined to sell, it had to sell in accordance with the provisions of s. 477. It fixed no price and it made no offer to the abutting owners. Council had no authority whatever to make this sale to T. It was not within its competence to pass any by-law authorizing such a sale or the execution of a deed to T.\nNothing was found in the conduct of the plaintiffs which would indicate any waiver of their rights and they could not be deprived of these rights except by compliance with s. 477. There was nothing in this case but a by-law which was passed in bad faith at the instigation of the reeve and simply to subserve his interest as a private individual. Such a by-law was a nullity. T\u2019s claim that under s. 38(1) of The Conveyancing and Law of Property Act he was entitled to a lien of $30,600 upon the lands in question, this being the amount that the land and the improvements had cost him, was rejected. Section 38(1) did not apply to a case such as this. T acquired this land knowing that s. 477 had not been complied with and knowing that he had no right to purchase. He could have no honest belief that he was making improvements on land that was his own. He knew the weaknesses of his title and took his chance.\nJones v. Tuckersmith (1915), 33 O.L.R. 634, referred to.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], reversing a judgment of King J. Appeal dismissed.\nH.E. Manning, Q.C., for the defendants, appellants.\nF.M. Catzman, Q.C., and M.A. Catzman, for the plaintiffs, respondents.\nJ.H. Boland, Q.C., for the Corporation of the Township of York.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014The municipality closed a highway and sold part of it to a municipal official without compliance with s. 477 of The Municipal Act, now R.S.O. 1960, c. 249, which compels the municipality, if it decides to sell, to fix a price and offer it to the abutting owner or owners. The trial judge dismissed the action. The Court of Appeal1 reversed this judgment and the defendant Tonks now appeals. The municipality submits its rights to the Court.\nThe Court of Appeal held that non-compliance with s. 477 of The Municipal Act results in a void transaction. They also held that in this particular case the conduct of the municipal official was fraudulent. They set aside that part of the by-law which authorized the sale and declared the deed of conveyance to be null and void.\nIn 1955 the two plaintiffs, Hazel Doreen Reid and John Caird Reid, who are husband and wife, purchased No. 2 Paulson Road in the Township of York as joint tenants. In 1959, the husband conveyed his interest to his wife, who remains the sole owner. The defendants, Christopher A. Tonks and Anna Tonks, are husband and wife. Christopher Tonks was elected a member of the municipal council of the Township of York in 1951. He was elected as deputy reeve in 1952 and was appointed acting reeve on September 4, 1956. He was elected reeve in December 1956 and held this office until December 1960.\nNo. 2 Paulson Road was a corner lot before Myra Road was closed. It fronts on Paulson Road and its easterly boundary was Myra Road. Paulson Road runs east and west, Myra Road north and south. The property was on the northwest corner. There is no access for vehicles to the rear of No. 2 Paulson Road from Paulson Road. Before the closing there was access to the rear of the property from Myra Road. Myra Road had been dedicated as a highway in 1951 by by-law of the township and it was closed on August 13, 1956, by by-law 15396. There is no attack on the propriety of the closing.\nOn September 10, 1956, Reid wrote to the township clerk and solicitor to say that he wished to acquire part of the west side of Myra Road as closed by the by-law to enable him to gain access to the rear of his property. He received an acknowledgment of his letter from the clerk and solicitor telling him that it would be put before council at its next meeting and that he would be advised later. Reid\u2019s letter was put before the Committee of General Purposes of the township on September 17, 1956. Tonks was then acting reeve of the township and was present at the meeting of the committee, which referred the request to the Committee on Sale of Land. The report of the Committee of General Purposes referring Reid\u2019s request was approved by the township council at a meeting on October 9, 1956, at which Tonks was present as acting reeve. There is no record that Reid was advised that his request was being considered, or that the Committee on Sale of Land ever dealt with his application. His letter is missing from the file and has never been found. Reid heard nothing further about his application and assumed that nothing could be done.\nEarly in 1957, Tonks became interested in buying the southern half of Myra Road, which abutted on the plaintiff\u2019s property. He well knew as a member of council that he was disqualified from purchasing. He had consulted the township solicitor and had received this advice. Tonks discussed the matter with another deputy reeve and decided to buy the property in the name of a nominee. In June 1957, he had one Joseph Fraser, a friend and relative by marriage, submit an offer for $6,600. Fraser enclosed his own cheque for $1,320 with the offer as a deposit. This money was supplied by Tonks. The offer was made subject to a condition that the municipality as vendor would secure the approval of the Ontario Municipal Board to amend a restrictive by-law against building on a lot having a frontage of less than 70 feet. Myra Road was only 66 feet wide. Fraser\u2019s offer of June 10, 1957, was submitted to the Committee of General Purposes, which recommended directly to council that the offer be accepted. Tonks was then reeve and was present at the meeting. If it makes any difference, there is no evidence that Tonks declared his interest at the meeting, although he does say that he may have disclosed it to some of the members before the meeting. There is no reference to any disclosure in the minutes of the meeting.\nOn June 17, the report of the Committee of General Purposes was approved by council, which formally accepted Fraser\u2019s offer by enacting by-law 15649. On June 24, 1957, council enacted by-law 15656 permitting the erection of a house on these lands notwithstanding that they had a frontage of less than 70 feet. Tonks was present at that meeting and signed the by-law in his capacity as reeve. Again he made no disclosure of his interest in the by-law. He says that he assumed that everybody knew. The by-law was submitted to and approved by the Ontario Municipal Board without any disclosure of Tonks\u2019 interest.\nFraser, who was the first nominee of Tonks, did not take a conveyance of the property. He assigned his right to purchase to Marie Eunice Froman, another nominee of Tonks. She received a deed from the township on January 14, 1958, executed by Tonks, as reeve, and by the township clerk. On December 19, 1957, Fraser, the first nominee, had paid the balance of the purchase price with money supplied by Tonks.\nOn July 17, 1958, Marie Eunice Froman executed a deed to Tonks and his wife. This deed was registered on the following day, which was more than one year after the enactment of by-law 15649 which had approved the sale to Fraser.\nTonks applied for a building permit to erect a house on this property on December 20, 1957. His plans were approved on January 14, 1958 and he began building the house in April of 1958.\nThe learned trial judge found that the township had not complied with the provisions of s. 477 of The Municipal Act in selling this property. He was, however, of the opinion that the township by-law 15649, passed on June 17, 1957, approving the acceptance of Fraser\u2019s offer, was voidable only and could not be impeached except by an application to quash brought within one year of its passage. No such application having been made, the action failed and was dismissed with costs.\nThe Court of Appeal in reversing the judgment held that the by-law was a nullity for non\u2011compliance with s. 477 and should be set aside on that ground. They also found fraud on the part of Tonks. They further rejected a defence that the plaintiffs had waived their rights under s. 477 and had acquiesced in Tonks\u2019 purchase.\nI agree with the judgment of the Court of Appeal that if the provisions of s. 477 of The Municipal Act are not observed, the council is without authority and a by-law authorizing sale is void and is open to attack notwithstanding that more than a year has elapsed from the date of its passing. The provisions of s. 477 are set out here:\n477. (1) Where a highway for the site of which compensation was paid is established and laid out in place of the whole or any part of an original allowance for road, or where the whole or any part of a highway is legally stopped up, if the council determines to sell such original allowance or such stopped-up highway, the price at which it is to be sold shall be fixed by the council, and the owner of the land that abuts on it has the right to purchase the soil and freehold of it at that price.\n(2) Where there are more owners than one, each has the right to purchase that part of it upon which his land abuts to the middle line of the stopped-up highway.\n(3) If the owner does not exercise his right to purchase within such period as may be fixed by the by-law or by a subsequent by-law, the council may sell the part that he has the right to purchase to any other person at the same or a greater price.\nWords could not be plainer. The council was under no compulsion to sell, but if it determined to sell, it had to sell in accordance with these provisions. It fixed no price and it made no offer to the abutting owners. Council had no authority whatever to make this sale to Tonks. It was not within its competence to pass any by-law authorizing such a sale or the execution of a deed to Tonks. This is the effect of Jones v. Tuckersmith[2], and I agree with the analysis of that case in the reasons of the Court of Appeal[3].\nThe Court of Appeal stated a second ground for its reasons for judgment. They held that the reeve of this municipality fraudulently acquired this land in violation of the rights of abutting owners. A mere recital of the facts as I have outlined them leads irresistibly to this inference. No innocent construction is possible. Although Reid had enquired in good time about his right to purchase, he was ignored, and I think deliberately ignored, and the person who appeared on the scene as the ultimate purchaser was the reeve. There can be no doubt that he had determined to purchase this property when he well knew that his position forbade him to do so, and Reid had no notice of this until it was an accomplished fact. When he learned about it, instead of at once attacking the transaction, he tried to make a deal with Tonks which would give him access to the rear of his lot. From what Reid did it is argued that he renounced or waived his rights under s. 477. Reid\u2019s explanation is that he was confronted by the fact of acquisition and that he did the best he could. It is urged against him that he did not follow up his letter of 1956; that when he knew that Tonks had become the purchaser he signed consents on his own behalf and persuaded others to sign consents to have the restriction of 70 feet varied; that in March of 1958 he was not interested in buying more land. He had in fact separated from his wife and was not living in the house. I have already mentioned that he conveyed his interest to his wife in 1959. But he also said that he was promised access to the rear of his lot by Tonks\u2014Reid says 12 feet wide, Tonks says 8 feet\u2014but as a result of Tonks\u2019 building plans, which were perhaps dictated by the configuration of the ground, the space between the two houses was too narrow for vehicles to pass between them.\nI can find nothing in the conduct of the Reids which would indicate any waiver of their rights and I do not think that they can be deprived of these rights except by compliance with s. 477. There is nothing in this case but a by-law which was passed in bad faith at the instigation of the reeve and simply to subserve his interest as a private individual. Such a by-law is a nullity.\nThe final point raised by the appellant is that under s. 38(1) of The Conveyancing and Law of Property Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 66, he is entitled to a lien of $30,600 upon the lands in question. This is what the land and the improvements cost him. Section 38(1) reads:\n38. (1) Where a person makes lasting improvements on land under the belief that it is his own, he or his assigns are entitled to a lien upon it to the extent of the amount by which its value is enhanced by the improvements, or are entitled or may be required to retain the land if the court is of opinion or requires that this should be done, according as may under all circumstances of the case be most just, making compensation for the land, if retained, as the court directs.\nThis section does not apply to a case such as this. Tonks acquired this land knowing that s. 477 had not been complied with and knowing that he had no right to purchase. He could have no honest belief that he was making improvements on land that was his own. He knew the weaknesses of his title and he took his chance. His claim for a lien should be rejected.\nI would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal and dismiss this appeal with costs. The municipality submitted its rights to the Court. There should be no order for costs for or against it.\nAppeal dismissed with costs. No costs for or against the Township of York.\nSolicitors for the defendants, appellants: Manning, Bruce, Paterson & Ridout, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, respondents: Catzman & Wahl, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the Township, of York: J.H.

The appellants denied liability on the note, and counterclaimed for damages for fraudulent misrepresentations, which they claimed had been made to them by the respondent and had induced them to enter into the contract for the purchase of the shares.\nThe trial judge dismissed the respondent\u2019s claim and awarded to the appellants one half of the damages that they had claimed. On appeal, the respondent\u2019s claim on the note was allowed and the majority of the Court directed that the damages claimed by the appellants be referred back for assessment. The appellants appealed and the respondent cross-appealed from the judgment of the Appellate Division.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed and the cross-appeal allowed.\nThe appellants failed to establish that they were induced to enter the contract to purchase the shares by reason of fraudulent misrepresentation by the respondent. The Court agreed with the reasons of Porter J.A., in his dissenting judgment, for deciding that, accepting the findings of the trial judge as to certain statements made by the respondent to the appellant H, the evidence did not support the conclusion that it was their reliance upon those statements which led the appellants to enter into the contract to purchase the shares.\nThe following items of evidence were significant in this regard:\n1. It was not the respondent who first sought to effect the sale to the appellants. On the contrary, H, on learning that the respondent wished to dispose of the business, made the first approach.\n2. A statement by the respondent about not having to put his hand into his pocket was made, according to H, on an occasion when the respondent explained the daily cash register to him. This book clearly disclosed a $4,000 payment made to the company by another company controlled by the respondent in March 1959, which the trial judge said was not discovered by the appellants until 1962.\n3. In considering the impact of the respondent\u2019s representation that the restaurant was paying its way, it was significant that the agreement precluded the respondent from receiving payments for the shares (other than a $2,000 cash payment plus the value of the liquor on the premises) unless the business was earning a net profit.\n4. It was after the appellants had operated the business for seven months at a loss, and after they had received a balance sheet and a statement of liabilities of the company, prepared as of the date of the sale of the shares, that they agreed to execute the promissory note in favour of the respondent.\n5. Notwithstanding the lack of success in the operation of the restaurant business, the appellants made payments on the note until December 1960.\n6. No suggestion of misrepresentation on the part of the respondent was made until after the respondent had sued on the note in August 1962, more than three years after the agreement was made.\nAPPEAL and CROSS-APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division, allowing in part an appeal from a judgment of Manning J. dismissing the respondent\u2019s action under a promissory note and awarding damages to the appellants under a counterclaim for false misrepresentation in respect of the sale of certain shares. Appeal dismissed and cross-appeal allowed.\nWilliam B. Gill, Q.C., for the defendants, appellants.\nReginald J. Gibbs, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014This action was brought by the respondent against the appellants for the balance owing on a promissory note dated January 11, 1960, whereby the appellants promised to pay the respondent $10,727.09 with interest at 6 per cent per annum on the unpaid balance, computed from June 1, 1959. The note was payable at the rate of $350 per month from March 15, 1960, until February 15, 1963, when the balance was payable. It contained provision for acceleration of payment in the event of non-payment of any instalment. This note was given by way of payment of the balance owing by the appellants to the respondent for the purchase price of all the shares of Safari Restaurants Limited (hereinafter called \u201cthe Company\u201d), which had been owned by the respondent and his wife. The Company operated a restaurant in the City of Calgary. The appellants Gregg and Hopwood were members of a Calgary law firm which, prior to and for some time after the sale, acted for the respondent.\nThe appellants denied liability on the note, and counter-claimed for damages for fraudulent misrepresentations, which they claimed had been made to them by the respondent and had induced them to enter into the contract for the purchase of the shares.\nThe contract of sale, made on May 26, 1959, provided for the sale by the respondent and his wife to the appellants of their shares in the Company, for the sum of $40,000 plus the value of all stock-in-trade on the restaurant premises, less the amount of all the liabilities of the Company. If such liabilities exceeded $40,000 the excess was to be paid by the vendors of the shares. The agreement provided for the determination of the liabilities by the Company\u2019s auditor.\nThe respondent, and a company which he controlled, Western Store Fixtures Limited, agreed to cancel the Company\u2019s indebtedness to each of them. (In fact, at the time of the agreement, the Company was indebted to Western Store Fixtures Limited in the amount of $32,700, but the respondent owed the Company $7,525. By agreement, both of these debts were cancelled.)\nThe agreement provided for vendors\u2019 liens on the shares sold and for payment of the balance due under the agreement if the appellants resold the shares.\nThe appellants agreed to give a promissory note for the balance payable for the shares, on the terms and conditions in the agreement.\nThe purchase price was payable, in cash, as to $2,000 and the value of the liquor on the premises at invoice price. The balance was payable, with interest at 6 per cent per annum, in monthly payments of $1,542.98 less the monthly pay- ments payable by the Company under all its finance contracts, plus one half of the Company\u2019s net monthly profits (if any), after deduction therefrom of the said sum of $1,542.98.\nThe evidence is that the figure of $1,542.98 represented the monthly amount due, at the time of sale, by the Company under its finance contracts. For such time as those payments were required to be paid by the Company, in essence, the vendors were to be paid only out of the Company\u2019s net profits (if any).\nThe Company\u2019s auditor prepared a statement of liabilities and a balance sheet, as of May 31, 1959, which were received by the appellants early in January 1960. The former fixed the total of Company liabilities to be deducted from the purchase price of $40,000 at $26,445.81. The latter disclosed an indebtedness of $32,700 of the Company to Western Store Fixtures Limited, and a debt of the respondent to the Company of $7,525. It disclosed assets of $62,964 and liabilities (including capital stock equity of 15,050 shares of no par value at $15,050) of $79,329.41. The difference between these two figures, $16,365.41, was shown on the balance sheet as being:\nBalance at debit on September 30, 1958.................................................\n$ 12,293.94\nAdd loss per statement................................................................................\n4,071.47\n$ 16,365.41\nA footnote to the balance sheet stated:\nNote - Item of $7,525.00 due from H. Auld & $32,700.00 due to Western Store Fixtures Ltd. will not apply after May 31, 1959.\nIn the interval between the date of the sale of the shares, May 31, 1959, and the receipt of the statement of liabilities and balance sheet, in January 1960, there had been no net profits earned from the operation of the restaurant by the appellants.\nIt was subsequent to the receipt of this material from the Company\u2019s auditor that the appellants, on January 11, 1960, signed the promissory note in favour of the respondent on which the latter has sued. The effect of that note was to commit the appellants to make specific monthly payments to the respondent, not tied to the earning of net profits by the Company. At the same time, the respondent and his wife signed an agreement to accept the note in full satisfaction of all claims under the agreement, thereby relinquishing any lien on the shares, and freeing the appellants from the obligation to make full payment of the balance owing under the agreement in the event of a resale of the shares.\nDuring the year 1960 payments were made on the note by the appellants, the last being made in December of that year.\nIn February 1960, the restaurant was leased on a basis whereby the tenant paid as rent 10 per cent of the gross proceeds each month. This lease was terminated in July 1961. Early in 1962 an agreement was made by the appellants to sell the shares to one Haderer for $47,500, with a down payment of $15,000 in the form of restaurant equipment, which was subsequently distrained by Haderer\u2019s landlord.\nWhen Haderer was unable to complete the transaction, the shares were returned to the appellants who sold them to one Vogel at a price of $28,000 with a cash payment of some $7,500. No further payments were made and the Company went into liquidation, out of which the appellants recovered $4,000.\nIn July of 1962 the respondent demanded payment of his note, and the next month commenced action upon it. The appellants, for the first time, by their defence alleged fraudulent misrepresentation by the respondent, and counterclaimed for damages. The allegation was that, prior to the sale of the shares by the respondent and his wife, the respondent had represented that the restaurant was earning sufficient money to pay all current expenses in full, including rent and monthly instalments payable to finance companies.\nThe learned trial judge found that the respondent had told the appellant Hopwood, who conducted the negotiations for the appellants, that the business was \u201cpaying its way\u201d, and that the respondent had not had to put his hand \u201cin his own pocket\u201d for some time. He found that the appellants had relied on the respondent\u2019s statements, and that it was not until 1962 that Hopwood discovered from the records of the Company that it had always lost money and that the respondent had advanced $4,000 to the business in March 1959.\nIn the result, he dismissed the respondent\u2019s claim and awarded to the appellants one half of the damages they had claimed. Those damages represented all the moneys the appellants testified they had paid into the business of the Company. The 50 per cent reduction was on the basis that the respondent could not have reasonably anticipated that the appellants would continue to put money into the business for the length of time which they did. He gave the appellants judgment for $19,350.\nOn appeal, the Appellate Division allowed the respondent\u2019s claim on the note. The majority of the Court directed that the damages claimed by the appellants be referred back for assessment, to be confined to a period of one and one half years from May 31, 1959, with credit to be given for the amounts received by the appellants on the sales of their shares to Haderer and to Vogel. Porter J.A. dissented as to this direction and would have dismissed the counterclaim.\nFrom this judgment the appellants now appeal and the respondent has cross-appealed.\nDuring the course of the argument before us, counsel for the appellants was advised that the Court was unanimously of the view that, if the appellants were entitled to recover any damages based on the claim that they had been induced to purchase the shares by fraudulent misrepresentation, the measure of damages, in the circumstances of this case, was not the amount of money advanced by the appellants to the Company, but the difference between what the appellants had agreed to pay for the shares and their actual value at the time of purchase.\nI do not find it necessary to determine whether damages computed in that way have actually been established. I am in agreement with the reasons of Porter J.A., in his dissenting judgment, for deciding that, accepting the findings of the learned trial judge as to the statements made by the respondent to Hopwood, the evidence does not support the conclusion that it was their reliance upon those statements which led the appellants to enter into the contract to purchase the shares. The following items of evidence are significant in this regard:\n1. It was not the respondent who first sought to effect the sale to the appellants. On the contrary, Hopwood, on learning that the respondent wished to dispose of the business, made the first approach.\n2. The respondent\u2019s statement about not having to put his hand into his pocket was made, according to Hopwood, on the occasion when the respondent brought in the daily cash register. Hopwood also says that the respondent took him through the book, showed him the amount of the restaurant\u2019s sales and explained the book to him. This book clearly disclosed the $4,000 payment made to the Company by the respondent\u2019s company, Western Store Fixtures Limited, in March 1959, which the learned trial judge says was not discovered by the appellants until 1962.\n3. In considering the impact of the respondent\u2019s representation that the restaurant was paying its way, it is significant that the agreement precluded the respondent from receiving payments for the shares (other than the $2,000 cash payment plus the value of the liquor on the premises) unless the business was earning a net profit.\n4. It was after the appellants had operated the business for seven months at a loss, and after receiving the balance sheet and statement of liabilities, that they agreed to execute the promissory note in favour of the respondent.\n5. Notwithstanding the lack of success in the operation of the restaurant business, the appellants made payments on the note until December 1960.\n6. No suggestion of misrepresentation on the part of the respondent was made until after the respondent had sued on the note in August 1962, more than three years after the agreement was made.\nIn the light of these facts, and for the reasons given by Porter J.A., I am of the opinion that the appellants have failed to establish that they were induced to enter the contract to purchase the shares by reason of fraudulent misrepresentation by the respondent. I would, therefore, dismiss the appeal and allow the cross-appeal, both with costs. The respondent should be entitled to the costs of the trial and of the appeal to the Appellate Division.\nAppeal dismissed and cross-appeal allowed, both with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendants, appellants: Gill, Condrad & Cronin, Calgary.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: Prothroe, Gibbs, McCruden & Hilland, Calgary.\n"}

Comme prix de vente, \u00e0 une compagnie \u00e9tablie pour ces fins, l'appelant re\u00e7ut 5,896 actions sans valeur au pair de la compagnie et qui furent \u00e9valu\u00e9es \u00e0 $29,480. En plus, l'acheteur assumait une hypoth\u00e8que de $81,800 sur cet immeuble. Le m\u00eame jour, l'appelant vendait pour un prix de $121,700 les 5,896 actions, soit $92,220 de plus que la valeur qui leur avait \u00e9t\u00e9 attribu\u00e9e originalement. Le Ministre a cotis\u00e9 le profit sur les actions comme \u00e9tant un revenu imposable, mais a subs\u00e9quemment pris la position que le prix de vente de l'h\u00f4tel avait \u00e9t\u00e9 de $203,500 ($81,800 plus $121,700), et que des biens susceptibles de d\u00e9pr\u00e9ciation avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 vendus pour un montant exc\u00e9dant leur co\u00fbt en capital non d\u00e9pr\u00e9ci\u00e9.

The buyer, a company formed for that purpose, assumed a mortgage of $81,800 on the building and also gave 5,896 of its shares without par value and on which a value of $29,480 was placed. The same day, the appellant sold the 5,896 shares for $121,700, or $92,220 more than the value attributed to them in the first transaction. The Minister assessed the profit on the shares as income, but subsequently took the position that the sale price of the hotel had been $203,500 ($81,800 plus $121,700), and that depreciable assets had been disposed of for an amount exceeding their depreciated capital cost. The appellant was therefore subject to capital cost allowance recapture amounting to $71,922.14 pursuant to s. 20(1) of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148. The Minister's contention was maintained by the Tax Appeal Board and by the Exchequer Court.

Ce dernier accepta l'offre sous la r\u00e9serve qu'advenant le cas o\u00f9 il ne pourrait donner un titre clair, le contrat deviendrait nul ipso facto, sans indemnit\u00e9 de sa part, le ch\u00e8que de $4,000 qui accompagnait l'offre devant \u00eatre retourn\u00e9 \u00e0 la demanderesse. Plusieurs mois plus tard, la demanderesse, qui n'avait pas re\u00e7u les titres convenus, institua une action dans laquelle elle demandait la r\u00e9solution du contrat, une condamnation pour dommages de $66,750 et le retour du ch\u00e8que d\u00e9pos\u00e9 avec l'offre d'achat. La Cour Sup\u00e9rieure accueillit l'action mais r\u00e9duisit les dommages \u00e0 la somme de $5,775. La Cour d'Appel, par un jugement majoritaire, rejeta l'appel de la demanderesse quant au quantum des dommages et rejeta le contre-appel du d\u00e9fendeur sur la question de sa responsabilit\u00e9. La demanderesse en appela devant cette Cour, et comme il n'y a pas eu de contre-appel de la part du d\u00e9fendeur, le seul point \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer se limitait \u00e0 la question du quantum des dommages.\nArr\u00eat: L'appel doit \u00eatre maintenu.\nEn vertu de l'art. 1074 du Code Civil, le d\u00e9fendeur \u00e9tait tenu des dommages que le bon p\u00e8re de famille avait pu pr\u00e9voir. La preuve au dossier d\u00e9montrait qu'en raison des d\u00e9veloppements nombreux et consid\u00e9rables, des subdivisions de terres, dans la r\u00e9gion en question, la valeur r\u00e9elle de la terre devait s'appr\u00e9cier en fonction de la valeur commerciale des terres r\u00e9cemment vendues dans les environs, tenant compte du facteur de sp\u00e9culation, et non en fonction de la valeur que pouvait avoir cette terre pour exploitation agricole. Le bon p\u00e8re de famille pouvait noter ces facteurs et en pr\u00e9voir l'intervention, comme cause \u00e9trang\u00e8re, dans la r\u00e9alisation du dommage que causerait l'inex\u00e9cution de l'obligation, et que ce dommage pourrait, quant \u00e0 la quotit\u00e9, \u00eatre substantiellement \u00e0 la mesure de celui que la preuve justifiait ici, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque de la contravention. Dans l'esp\u00e8ce, cette preuve justifiait un dommage de $47,750, montant auquel s'est arr\u00eat\u00e9 le juge dissident en Cour d'Appel.\nImmovables\u2014Offer to purchase\u2014Acceptation provided clear title can be given\u2014Titles not given\u2014Action to annul contract and in damages\u2014Quantum of damages\u2014Civil Code, art. 1074.\nThe plaintiff offered to purchase from the defendant an immovable property for the sum of $31,000. The latter accepted the offer provided that if he could not give clear title, the contract would become null ipso facto, without indemnity on his part, the cheque for $4,000 which was deposited with the offer to be then returned to the plaintiff. Several months later, the plaintiff, who had not received the titles, instituted an action in which it asked for the annulment of the contract, a condemnation in demnation in damages in the amount of $66,750 and the return of the cheque deposited with the offer to purchase. The Superior Court maintained the action and awarded $5,775 in damages. The Court of Appeal, by a majority judgment, dismissed the appeal of the plaintiff as to the quantum of damages and dismissed the cross-appeal of the defendant on the question of his liability. The plaintiff appealed to this Court, and as there was no cross-appeal on behalf of the defendant, the only question to be considered was limited to the quantum of damages.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nUnder art. 1074 of the Civil Code, the defendant was liable for the damages which a prudent administrator might have foreseen. The evidence in this case established that by reason of the numerous and considerable developments, of the subdivision of properties, in the area, the real value of the property had to be appreciated in relation to the commercial value of the properties recently sold in the neighbourhood, taking into account the factor of speculation, and not in relation to the value which this property could have as a farm. The prudent administrator could note these factors and foresee their intervention, as an external cause, in the realization of the damages which would be caused by the non-execution of the obligation, and that this damage could be, as to the quantum, substantially such as was justified by the evidence in this case, at the time of the violation. In the present case, this evidence justified damages in an amount of $47,750, as found by the dissenting judge in the Court of Appeal.\nAPPEAL from a majority judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec[1], dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Caron J.

Yelin, C.R., pour la demanderesse, appelante.\nJacques Gu\u00e9rin, pour le d\u00e9fendeur, intim\u00e9.\nLe jugement de la Cour fut rendu par\nLE JUGE FAUTEUX:\u2014Suivant contrat form\u00e9 entre les parties, le 12 juin 1953, \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, l'appelante offrit d'acheter de l'intim\u00e9 qui accepta et offrit de lui vendre, au prix de $31,000, une terre situ\u00e9e, en banlieue de Montr\u00e9al, en la paroisse de St-Vincent-de-Paul, comt\u00e9 de Laval. L'offre d'achat sp\u00e9cifiait que les titres devaient \u00eatre clairs et nets. De plus, cette offre \u00e9tait accompagn\u00e9e d'un ch\u00e8que accept\u00e9, au montant de $4,000, fait par l'appelante \u00e0 l'ordre de l'intim\u00e9, pour \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9 en acompte sur le prix de vente ou devenir sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 suivant que l'appelante donnerait ou ne donnerait pas suite \u00e0 l'entente. D'autre part, l'acceptation de l'offre de vente fut consentie, par l'intim\u00e9, sous la r\u00e9serve qu'advenant le cas o\u00f9 il ne pourrait donner un titre clair, le contrat deviendrait nul ipso facto, sans indemnit\u00e9 de sa part, le ch\u00e8que de $4,000 devant alors \u00eatre retourn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'appelante.\nPar la suite plusieurs mois s'\u00e9coul\u00e8rent. Advenant d\u00e9cembre 1954, l'appelante, n'ayant pas re\u00e7u les titres convenus, s'adressa \u00e0 la Cour sup\u00e9rieure et, dans une action prise contre l'intim\u00e9, all\u00e9gua que celui-ci avait refus\u00e9 de lui livrer les titres en question et demanda la r\u00e9solution du contrat, la condamnation de l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 lui payer la somme de $66,750 pour dommages et une d\u00e9claration qu'elle \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire du ch\u00e8que de $4,000 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 avec son offre d'achat. En d\u00e9fense l'intim\u00e9 plaida qu'en raison d'une substitution affectant partie des biens faisant l'objet du contrat, il ne pouvait donner un titre valable et que dans cette \u00e9ventualit\u00e9, le contrat, en vertu de la r\u00e9serve sous laquelle il avait accept\u00e9 et promis vendre, devenait nul ipso facto, sans indemnit\u00e9 de sa part et le ch\u00e8que de $4,000 devait retourner \u00e0 l'appelante.\nLa Cour sup\u00e9rieure consid\u00e9ra que l'intim\u00e9 n'avait pas prouv\u00e9 l'impossibilit\u00e9 pour lui de livrer un titre clair et net, qu'il ne pouvait en cons\u00e9quence r\u00e9clamer le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de la clause de nullit\u00e9 par lui invoqu\u00e9e et qu'il \u00e9tait responsable des dommages que l'inex\u00e9cution de son obligation avait caus\u00e9s \u00e0 l'appelante. La Cour rejeta la d\u00e9fense et accueillit l'action et ses conclusions, en r\u00e9duisant, cependant, \u00e0 la somme de $5,775, le quantum des dommages r\u00e9clam\u00e9s.\nCe jugement donna lieu (i) \u00e0 un appel (n\u00b07246) de la part de la compagnie Remer, qui demanda que le jugement soit infirm\u00e9 en autant que le quantum des dommages \u00e9tait concern\u00e9 et qu'on lui accord\u00e2t le montant r\u00e9clam\u00e9 par son action, soit $66,750, et (ii) \u00e0 un contre-appel (n\u00b07266) de la part de Robin, qui demanda le rejet de l'action, soumettant qu'il lui \u00e9tait impossible de livrer un titre clair, qu'il n'avait commis aucune faute et ne pouvait, en cons\u00e9quence, \u00eatre tenu \u00e0 payer aucuns dommages. Disons imm\u00e9diatement que le contre-appel de Robin fut rejet\u00e9 par un jugement majoritaire. La majorit\u00e9, form\u00e9e de MM. les Juges Rinfret, Montgomery et Rivard, jugea que le Juge de premi\u00e8re instance avait eu raison de conclure \u00e0 la faute, la responsabilit\u00e9 et condamnation en dommages de l'intim\u00e9. Dissidents, MM. les Juges Hyde et Brossard auraient fait droit \u00e0 ce contre-appel et rejet\u00e9 l'action. Aucun appel n'ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 log\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour Supr\u00eame \u00e0 l'encontre de ce jugement, il y a d\u00e9sormais chose jug\u00e9e sur la faute, la responsabilit\u00e9 de l'intim\u00e9 et le fait que la compagnie appelante a subi des dommages imputables \u00e0 ce dernier.\nD'autre part, l'appel de la Compagnie Remer fut aussi rejet\u00e9 par un jugement majoritaire; pour MM. les Juges Hyde et Brossard, c'\u00e9tait l\u00e0 l'in\u00e9vitable cons\u00e9quence de leurs conclusions sur le contre-appel de Robin, et quant a MM. les Juges Rinfret et Rivard ce rejet est fond\u00e9 sur l'accord qu'ils donnent au Juge de premi\u00e8re instance tant sur le quantum des dommages que sur le raisonnement et la base suivis pour en faire la d\u00e9termination. Dissident, M. le Juge Montgomery, adoptant une base diff\u00e9rente, aurait maintenu l'appel de la Compagnie Remer et augment\u00e9 le montant des dommages \u00e0 la somme de $47,750.\nDe l\u00e0 le pr\u00e9sent appel de la Compagnie Remer. II n'y a pas de contre-appel de la part de l'intim\u00e9. Ainsi donc et \u00e0 ce stade des proc\u00e9dures, le seul point \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer et \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer se limite a une question de quantum.\nDans son action, la Compagnie Remer a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 $66,750, en adoptant, comme mesure de son pr\u00e9judice, la diff\u00e9rence entre, d'une part, le prix de vente arr\u00eat\u00e9 par les parties au contrat, soit $31,000, et, d'autre part, la somme de $97,750, dont $96,250 et $1,500 repr\u00e9sentent respectivement, suivant elle, la valeur r\u00e9elle de la terre et du roulant. Dans sa d\u00e9fense, l'intim\u00e9 n'a pas contest\u00e9, du moins sp\u00e9cifiquement, le montant des dommages r\u00e9clam\u00e9s; il s'est content\u00e9 d'all\u00e9guer qu'il n'avait commis aucune faute, pour conclure qu'il n'avait aucune responsabilit\u00e9 ou dommages \u00e0 payer.\nLa preuve au dossier est tr\u00e8s simple. Elle consiste dans le t\u00e9moignage d'un expert, produit par l'appelante, Maurice Giroux, et du relev\u00e9, fait par ce dernier, des ventes r\u00e9centes dans les environs de la terre en question. Les qualifications de Giroux, ing\u00e9nieur professionnel, expert en \u00e9valuation et agent d'immeubles, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 admises par l'intim\u00e9. Son t\u00e9moignage n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contredit. En raison des d\u00e9veloppements nombreux et consid\u00e9rables, des subdivisions de terres, dans la r\u00e9gion o\u00f9 se trouve la terre de l'intim\u00e9, l'expert a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que la valeur r\u00e9elle de cette terre devait s'appr\u00e9cier en fonction de la valeur commerciale des terres r\u00e9cemment vendues dans les environs, tenant compte du facteur de sp\u00e9culation et non en fonction de la valeur que pouvait avoir cette terre pour exploitation agricole. Pour ces raisons, il n'a tenu aucun compte des b\u00e2timents et roulant s'y trouvant. Se basant sur le relev\u00e9 des ventes, sur son exp\u00e9rience de la valeur des terres sur l'\u00eele J\u00e9sus et sp\u00e9cialement \u00e0 St-Vincent-de-Paul, il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9poque de son examen, ce qui correspond en somme \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque de la contravention de l'intim\u00e9, la valeur r\u00e9elle de cette terre \u00e9tait de $550 l'arpent donnant ainsi une valeur totale de $96,250 pour cette terre ayant 175 arpents. En contre-interrogatoire, l'expert a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'une ferme pour l'agriculture se vendait au prix de $150 a $200 l'arpent. Mais la valeur pour fins de subdivision, et voil\u00e0, a-t-il ajout\u00e9, ce qui se faisait surtout, dans la r\u00e9gion de la terre en question, est de $550 l'arpent.\nLe Juge de premi\u00e8re instance jugea que la terre devait \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9e comme terre d'exploitation agricole; il \u00e9carta ainsi l'opinion, reposant sur des consid\u00e9rations valables et non contredites, de l'unique expert entendu sur la question, voulant que la valeur r\u00e9elle de cette terre devait s'appr\u00e9cier en fonction du fait qu'elle \u00e9tait situ\u00e9e dans un milieu d\u00e9j\u00e0 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 des d\u00e9veloppements nombreux, consid\u00e9rables, et \u00e9conomiquement propre \u00e0 lotissement. Pour ainsi juger, le Juge au proc\u00e8s r\u00e9f\u00e9ra (i) au fait que l'appelante n'avait pas re\u00e7u sp\u00e9cifiquement, par ses lettres patentes, le pouvoir de se livrer \u00e0 des entreprises sp\u00e9culatives et (ii) \u00e0 certaines stipulations du contrat, d'o\u00f9 il inf\u00e9ra une intention de l'appelante d'acheter la terre pour fins d'exploitation agricole et non pour fins de sp\u00e9culation. Ayant d\u00e8s lors jug\u00e9 que la valeur r\u00e9elle devait s'appr\u00e9cier en fonction d'une exploitation agricole, il \u00e9tablit \u00e0 $210 l'arpent, la valeur de la terre, en s'inspirant du relev\u00e9 des ventes indiquant que certaines terres avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 vendues pour exploitation agricole \u00e0 un prix variant de $200 a $225 l'arpent. C'est par ce proc\u00e9d\u00e9 qu'il arriva \u00e0 une \u00e9valuation totale de $36,750 dont il d\u00e9duisit le prix de vente, soit $31,000, pour d\u00e9terminer \u00e0 $5,775 le montant des dommages subis par l'appelante. En Cour d'Appel, ces vues re\u00e7urent l'accord de MM. les Juges Rinfret et Rivard, mais non de M. le Juge Montgomery. A son avis, l'intention, que pouvait peut-\u00eatre avoir l'appelante en achetant la terre, n'est pas, en l'esp\u00e8ce, une raison pertinente ou suffisante pour \u00e9carter l'opinion non contredite de l'expert quant \u00e0 la valeur bas\u00e9e sur les ventes des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s avoisinantes. De plus, il consid\u00e9ra comme non pertinente et au surplus mal fond\u00e9e l'appr\u00e9ciation des pouvoirs de la Compagnie Remer. S'appuyant sur Bonanza Creek Gold Mining Co. v. R.[3], il d\u00e9clara que la Compagnie Remer, incorpor\u00e9e en vertu de la Loi des compagnies de Qu\u00e9bec, a les pouvoirs d'une personne naturelle et que, de plus, le pouvoir de faire des actes d'acquisition et de disposition en mati\u00e8re immobili\u00e8re lui est express\u00e9ment donn\u00e9 suivant le texte ci-apr\u00e8s de ses lettres patentes:\nTo buy, take, lease, sell and assign, hypothecate, exchange, transfer and otherwise deal in, and dispose of property immoveable, and assets generally, either absolutely as owner or by way of collateral security, or otherwise \u2026\nNotant, ensuite, que l'expert Giroux s'\u00e9tait appuy\u00e9 sur des ventes faites \u00e0 des prix variant de $437 \u00e0 $547 l'arpent et que l'intim\u00e9, lui-m\u00eame, avait fait produire par Giroux, en contre-interrogatoire, deux actes de ventes indiquant, l'un, un prix de $500, et l'autre, un prix de $511 l'arpent, il d\u00e9clara ne pouvoir justifier un prix unitaire inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 $450, soit un prix total de $78,750 pour la terre, somme dont il d\u00e9duisit le prix de vente, pour d\u00e9terminer \u00e0 $47,750 la quotit\u00e9 des dommages subis par l'appelante.\nEn toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence pour ceux qui sont d'opinion contraire, je dois dire, qu'\u00e0 mon humble avis la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle est arriv\u00e9 M. le Juge Montgomery est conforme avec les principes de droit r\u00e9gissant l'esp\u00e8ce telle qu'elle se pr\u00e9sente d'apr\u00e8s la preuve au dossier. Le d\u00e9biteur, dont la contravention n'est pas accompagn\u00e9e de dol, n'est tenu, suivant l'art. 1074 du Code Civil, qu'aux dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9vus ou qu'on a pu pr\u00e9voir au temps o\u00f9 l'obligation a \u00e9t\u00e9 contract\u00e9e. En l'esp\u00e8ce, le dommage de l'appelante est proportionnel au gain dont elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e par suite de la contravention et \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 la diff\u00e9rence entre le prix fix\u00e9 au contrat et le prix repr\u00e9sentant la valeur au march\u00e9 de cette terre, au temps de la contravention. L'entente n'indique pas et ne pouvait d'ailleurs difficilement indiquer, dans les circonstances, une date pr\u00e9cise \u00e0 laquelle l'intim\u00e9 devait ex\u00e9cuter son obligation de fournir les titres convenus. Ce qui est clair, c'est que sa contravention, devenue manifeste lors de la mise en demeure en ao\u00fbt 1954, persistait lors de l'expertise de Giroux en octobre, et lors de l'institution de l'action, en d\u00e9cembre de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e. La valeur au march\u00e9 \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque ne pouvait ad\u00e9quatement s'\u00e9tablir, sans tenir compte des d\u00e9veloppements nombreux et consid\u00e9rables, des subdivisions, dans la r\u00e9gion, et des fluctuations et hausses du march\u00e9 en r\u00e9sultant. Voil\u00e0 ce qui ressort de la seule preuve au dossier, de l'opinion non contredite de l'expert Giroux. Prenant tous deux ces faits en consid\u00e9ration, l'expert Giroux, d'une part, fixa la valeur \u00e0 $550 l'arpent en s'appuyant sur le plus haut prix unitaire du march\u00e9, alors que M. le Juge Montgomery, d'autre part, s'arr\u00eata \u00e0 une valeur de $450 l'arpent en s'inspirant plut\u00f4t de la moyenne des prix unitaires du march\u00e9. Et c'est ainsi que ce dernier d\u00e9termina a $47,750\u2014somme que l'appelante d\u00e9clara trouver \u00e9quitable, \u00e0 l'audition devant nous\u2014le gain dont celle-ci fut priv\u00e9e ou le dommage qu'elle a subi, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque et par suite de la contravention. Reste \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer si ce gain ou ce dommage de $47,750, que la preuve justifie, \u00e9tait pr\u00e9visible \u00e0 la formation du contrat, en juin 1953. La pr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9 du dommage, envisag\u00e9e au jour du contrat, doit s'appr\u00e9cier in abstracto. II ne s'agit pas, en effet, du dommage que le d\u00e9biteur a pu pr\u00e9voir, mais qu'on a pu pr\u00e9voir, dit l'art. 1074, du Code Civil, ce qui veut dire: que le type abstrait du bon p\u00e8re de famille, de l'homme prudent et avis\u00e9 a pu pr\u00e9voir.

A mon avis, un bon p\u00e8re de famille, un homme prudent et avis\u00e9 pouvait, d\u00e8s lors, noter ces d\u00e9veloppements, ces subdivisions, cette fluctuation, cette hausse des prix, et en pr\u00e9voir l'intervention, comme cause \u00e9trang\u00e8re, dans la r\u00e9alisation du dommage que causerait l'inex\u00e9cution de l'obligation et que ce dommage pourrait, quant \u00e0 la quotit\u00e9, \u00eatre substantiellement \u00e0 la mesure de celui que la preuve justifie ici, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque de la contravention.\nJe dirais donc\u2014et en tout respect pour l'opinion contraire, je ne puis voir, au dossier, aucune raison d'\u00e9luder la conclusion\u2014que les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats auxquels l'intim\u00e9 est tenu envers l'appelante sont de $47,750.\nPour ces raisons, je maintiendrais l'appel, infirmerais le jugement de la Cour du banc de la reine et, modifiant le jugement de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure en tant que le quantum des dommages est concern\u00e9, condamnerais l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 payer \u00e0 l'appelante la somme de $47,750, avec int\u00e9r\u00eats et les d\u00e9pens de toutes les Cours.\nAppel maintenu.\nProcureur de la demanderesse, appelante: M.

Some eighteen months later, the Province expropriated a strip of that land forming 1.172 arpents for the purpose of constructing the Trans-Canada Highway. The farm house was located on the strip expropriated and had to be moved and relocated. The appellant contended that other buildings, which were not situated on that strip, such as a barn, a piggery and a shed, would also have to be moved. The Minister of Highways offered a sum of $7,235, but the appellant claimed $23,865.90. The Public Service Board awarded $7,490.70 for the value of the strip expropriated and for all damages resulting from the expropriation. The Court of Appeal, by a majority judgment, confirmed the award. The expropriated party appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Taschereau C.J. and Spence J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Fauteux and Judson JJ.: There were no grounds of law or of fact in this appeal which would justify the modification of the award.\nPer Abbott and Judson JJ.: So far as the damages sustained as a result of the expropriation are concerned, the appellant was entitled to be fully compensated but not enriched thereby. It has not been shown that the Public Service Board has proceeded upon an erroneous view of the law, or that there was no evidence on which the award could properly be arrived at or any manifest error leading to the result. On the contrary, the appellant was more than adequately compensated for what was taken and for any damages resulting therefrom.\nPer Taschereau C.J. and Spence J., dissenting: The criterion to be applied in the determination of the amount which should be awarded is not the purchase price of the farm, but the amount which will have to be expended in order to put back the farm in the state in which it was before the expropriation. The amount awarded by the Board to compensate the appellant for the damages caused by the moving of the piggery and the shed was manifestly insufficient.

Goulet, pour l'appelant.\nAndr\u00e9 Vigeant et Marcel Nichols, pour les intim\u00e9s.\nLe jugement du Juge en chef Taschereau et du Juge Spence fut rendu par\nLE JUGE EN CHEF (dissident):\u2014Il s'agit dans cette cause de proc\u00e9dures en expropriation intent\u00e9es par le Ministre de la Voirie de la province de Qu\u00e9bec. Ce dernier, repr\u00e9sentant Sa Majest\u00e9 au droit de la province, veut faire d\u00e9terminer par les tribunaux le montant auquel a droit l'expropri\u00e9 pour la partie de terrain dont s'est empar\u00e9 le Gouvernement, et les dommages qui r\u00e9sultent de cette expropriation.\nLorenzo Jutras, l'appelant, dont une partie de la terre fut ainsi expropri\u00e9e, est un cultivateur de Ste-Eulalie, ct\u00e9 de Nicolet, o\u00f9 il est propri\u00e9taire d'une ferme portant le n\u00b0 P-92 de la paroisse ci-dessus mentionn\u00e9e. M. Jutras a acquis cette terre avec tous ses b\u00e2timents vers 1960, pour une somme d'environ $6,000. Ce prix ne comprenait pas le roulant, mais l'acqu\u00e9reur a fait des am\u00e9liorations dont la valeur ne nous est pas r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9e. Le vendeur \u00e9tait un M. Armand D\u00e9silets qui, malade, \u00e9tait incapable de cultiver la terre depuis quatre ou cinq ans, c'est-\u00e0-dire depuis 1954 ou 1955. Au cours du mois de septembre 1961, le Ministre de la Voirie, pour les fins de la construction de la Route transcanadienne de Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, a donn\u00e9 avis \u00e0 l'appelant qu'il voulait acqu\u00e9rir une partie de son terrain, soit 43,120 pieds carr\u00e9s, \u00e9quivalent \u00e0 un arpent et cent soixante-douze (1.172) milli\u00e8mes carr\u00e9s plus ou moins, mesure anglaise. La nouvelle route 9, pour la construction de laquelle \u00e9tait requise une partie de la terre de l'appelant, \u00e9tait grev\u00e9e d'une servitude de \u00ab sans acc\u00e8s \u00bb, mais on accordait \u00e0 la partie restante du lot 92 une servitude r\u00e9elle de passage sur le chemin de desserte longeant parall\u00e8lement la ligne de \u00ab sans acc\u00e8s \u00bb.\nLa maison de l'appelant est situ\u00e9e sur le terrain expropri\u00e9, mais la grange, la porcherie et le hangar sont situ\u00e9s au sud de la r\u00e9sidence de l'appelant \u00e0 une distance d'environ cinquante pieds de l'ancienne route. Il s'agit donc de d\u00e9terminer la valeur du terrain dont l'appelant est priv\u00e9, le co\u00fbt de d\u00e9placement de la maison d'habitation et l'indemnit\u00e9 \u00e0 laquelle l'appelant peut avoir droit pour les dommages ou inconv\u00e9nients qui r\u00e9sultent de la d\u00e9sorganisation de sa ferme et du d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement possible de certains de ses b\u00e2timents.\nDevant la R\u00e9gie des Services Publics l'expropri\u00e9 a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 la somme de $23,865.90 et le Ministre de la Voirie lui a offert $7,235, montant qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9. La R\u00e9gie lui a accord\u00e9 $7,490.70 en compensation de la valeur du terrain expropri\u00e9 et de tous les dommages r\u00e9sultant de cette expropriation. Voici le d\u00e9tail de l'indemnit\u00e9 accord\u00e9e:\nValeur du terrain expropri\u00e9 (1.172 arpents)\n$ 117.20\n3,600 pieds de gazon \u00e0 0.05 cts le pied carr\u00e9\n180.00\nParterre, jardin et jardinage\n353.00\nEntretien de deux entr\u00e9es\n50.00\nPerte de 5 \u00e9rables, 4 pommiers, 3 peupliers,\n2 ormes\n125.00\nCl\u00f4tures\n100.00\nTroubles et ennuis\n150.00\nD\u00e9placement des b\u00e2tisses\u2014\nMaison\n4,190.50\nPorcherie et hangar\n600.00\nGrange\n1,625.00\n$7,490.70\nExpertise\n300.00\n$7,790.70 La Cour du banc de la reine[3] a confirm\u00e9 cet arr\u00eat des r\u00e9gisseurs. MM. les Juges Badeaux et Rivard, qui ont enregistr\u00e9 leur dissidence, auraient maintenu l'appel et accord\u00e9 une somme additionnelle de $5,150.\nLa plupart des montants accord\u00e9s sp\u00e9cifiquement par la R\u00e9gie ne sont pas contest\u00e9s, et ne pouvaient pas l'\u00eatre s\u00e9rieusement. Ainsi, les indemnit\u00e9s dont b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie l'appelant expropri\u00e9, qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 justement accord\u00e9es et dont personne ne se plaint, sont les suivantes: Valeur du terrain expropri\u00e9; 3,600 pieds de gazon \u00e0 0.05 cts le pied carr\u00e9; parterre, jardin et jardinage; entretien de deux entr\u00e9es; perte de 5 \u00e9rables, 4 pommiers, 3 peupliers, 2 ormes; cl\u00f4tures; troubles et ennuis.\nIl reste done les frais de d\u00e9placement des b\u00e2tisses, soit la maison, r\u00e9sidence de M. Jutras, la grange, la porcherie et le hangar. Il est important de ne pas oublier que la terre de M. Jutras \u00e9tait une terre bien organis\u00e9e. Dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, comme ailleurs, l'harmonie, la coordination des constructions ne s'improvisent pas chez le cultivateur, et le hasard n'a rien \u00e0 voir \u00e0 la disposition des b\u00e2timents. On ne peut pas, sans causer de graves inconv\u00e9nients et de substantiels dommages, changer le site des b\u00e2timents que l'exp\u00e9rience a d\u00e9sign\u00e9. Avant d'organiser une ferme, il faut tenir compte de bien des facteurs: on doit prendre en consid\u00e9ration quels sont les vents dominants dans la r\u00e9gion, afin d'\u00e9viter \u00e0 la maison les odeurs f\u00e9tides et naus\u00e9abondes venant des granges et des porcheries; il faut \u00e9galement assurer aux r\u00e9sidents de la ferme un acc\u00e8s facile \u00e0 la route ainsi qu'au reste de la terre. Il faut que les animaux broutent sans \u00eatre trop pr\u00e8s des maisons, et les vaches doivent pa\u00eetre dans les endroits les plus favorables. Tout cela demande un plan, une vue d'ensemble, une disposition g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, qui, lorsque r\u00e9ussis, comme dans le cas qui nous occupe, donnent une valeur accrue \u00e0 un bien rural.\nA l'origine, lors de l'\u00e9tablissement de la ferme de M. Jutras, il a fallu tenir compte de la situation de la route, de l'endroit o\u00f9 devaient \u00eatre plac\u00e9s les b\u00e2timents, de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 faciliter l'exploitation efficace de la terre, et lui donner un meilleur rendement.\nL'expropriation cause \u00e0 l'appelant de s\u00e9rieux ennuis. Il est clair qu'il faudra d\u00e9placer la maison de l'appelant. Elle est situ\u00e9e sur l'assiette m\u00eame de la route transcanadienne, et il est n\u00e9cessaire de la reculer \u00e0 une distance de pr\u00e8s de cent pieds de l'endroit o\u00f9 elle se trouve actuellement. Pour accomplir ce travail la r\u00e9gie a accord\u00e9 la somme de $4,190.50, mais \u00e0 l'audience et dans son factum, l'appelant a dit qu'il ne contestait pas ce montant, et il s'en est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 satisfait.\nSur un plan parall\u00e8le \u00e0 la route, la grange, la porcherie et le hangar sont situ\u00e9s \u00e0 l'arri\u00e8re de la maison et ont \u00e9t\u00e9 dispos\u00e9s rationnellement en fonction de l'exploitation agricole. La R\u00e9gie a accord\u00e9 \u00e0 l'expropri\u00e9 la somme de $1,625 pour le r\u00e9am\u00e9nagement de la grange. La R\u00e9gie a cru que l'expropri\u00e9 en d\u00e9pensant ce montant offert par le minist\u00e8re de la Voirie pourrait rendre sa grange et son puits aussi avantageusement utilisables avant qu'apr\u00e8s l'expropriation. Ce montant accord\u00e9 n'est pas g\u00e9n\u00e9reux, mais, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que la Cour d'Appel a unanimement (m\u00eame les juges dissidents) cru que ce montant \u00e9tait satisfaisant, je pense qu'il n'y a pas lieu pour cette Cour d'intervenir.\nDu montant total accord\u00e9 par la R\u00e9gie, on ne trouve que la somme de $600 pour compenser l'expropri\u00e9 des dommages occasionn\u00e9s par le d\u00e9placement de la porcherie et du hangar. Les r\u00e9gisseurs croient que ces deux b\u00e2timents ont peu de valeur, mais je suis d'opinion que ce montant est manifestement trop bas, et sur ce point je m'accorde avec les deux juges dissidents de la Cour d'Appel, MM. les Juges Badeaux et Rivard.\nQuand le Ministre de la Voirie a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de prendre les pr\u00e9sentes proc\u00e9dures en expropriation, il s'est autoris\u00e9 de l'art. 1066 du Code de Proc\u00e9dure civile de la province de Qu\u00e9bec. Le paragraphe (x) de cet article dit que le Ministre peut, dans la description de l'immeuble expropri\u00e9 ou par avis \u00e9crit donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'expropri\u00e9, d\u00e9clarer qu'il n'entend pas acqu\u00e9rir certaines constructions se trouvant sur le terrain requis, mais obliger l'expropri\u00e9 \u00e0 les d\u00e9placer. L'expropri\u00e9 doit, en ce cas, effectuer le d\u00e9placement dans les trente jours de l'avis qui lui est donn\u00e9 par lettre recommand\u00e9e, \u00e0 moins que sur requ\u00eate, la R\u00e9gie n'en ordonne autrement. Si les travaux de d\u00e9placement ne sont pas entrepris dans les quinze jours de l'avis ou termin\u00e9s dans le d\u00e9lai voulu, le Ministre peut les faire effectuer et placer les constructions sur le terrain de l'expropri\u00e9 \u00e0 l'endroit le plus commode. Le Ministre n'a pas jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos d'exproprier la terre en totalit\u00e9, mais il a pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 ordonner le d\u00e9placement de certaines b\u00e2tisses, dont la maison avec annexes, et le hangar. Il doit donc payer les frais de d\u00e9placement m\u00eame s'ils sont sup\u00e9rieurs au co\u00fbt total de la terre. Ceci peut para\u00eetre un peu paradoxal, mais je n'y vois aucune contradiction. La R\u00e9gie, comme la Cour d'Appel, l'ont bien compris et ont admis le principe. L'expropri\u00e9 a pay\u00e9 pour l'ensemble de sa terre la somme d'environ $6,000 et la R\u00e9gie lui a accord\u00e9 au-del\u00e0 de $7,500 pour les dommages caus\u00e9s.\nMais, dans le cas qui nous occupe, le crit\u00e8re qu'il faut appliquer et qui permettra de d\u00e9terminer le montant qui doit \u00eatre accord\u00e9, n'est pas le prix pay\u00e9 pour la ferme, mais bien le montant qui devra \u00eatre d\u00e9pens\u00e9 pour la remettre dans l'\u00e9tat o\u00f9 elle \u00e9tait avant l'expropriation. Il est facile de voir que ce dernier chiffre peut \u00eatre sup\u00e9rieur au premier. En effet, il faut d\u00e9molir, transporter les mat\u00e9riaux et reconstruire de nouveau. Il faut r\u00e9organiser le syst\u00e8me d'aqueduc, le syst\u00e8me d'eau, niveler les terrains, d\u00e9placer les cl\u00f4tures pour les replacer ailleurs, etc. Il faut pratiquement faire le travail en double. Je ne puis donc accepter l'argument que l'expropri\u00e9 ne peut obtenir davantage parce qu'il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 obtenu plus qu'il n'a pay\u00e9 pour toute la terre.\nL'intim\u00e9 a choisi la fa\u00e7on dont devait s'engager et se plaider le litige. Par ses procureurs, il a, le 18 septembre 1961, fait d\u00e9poser au Bureau d'enregistrement du comt\u00e9 de Nicolet un plan g\u00e9n\u00e9ral montrant les terrains requis pour l'expropriation de la route transcanadienne \u00e0 Ste-Eulalie avec un estim\u00e9 global des indemnit\u00e9s. Cet estim\u00e9 comprend le prix des terrains requis, l'achat des b\u00e2tisses ainsi que tous les dommages r\u00e9sultant de l'expropriation, comme le mentionne le certificat du Registrateur.\nLe 27 septembre de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e, l'officier en loi du minist\u00e8re de la Voirie \u00e9crivait \u00e0 l'expropri\u00e9 pour l'informer que le d\u00e9p\u00f4t du plan fait au bureau du Registrateur avait pour effet de transporter au Ministre la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de partie de l'immeuble P-92, et pour l'aviser \u00e9galement qu'il recevrait dans un bref d\u00e9lai un nouvel avis disant quel \u00e9tait le montant que d\u00e9sirait lui offrir l'intim\u00e9 pour le terrain requis, ainsi que pour tous les autres dommages r\u00e9sultant de l'expropriation. On ajoutait dans cette lettre que s'il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9placer des b\u00e2tisses, M. Jutras en serait avis\u00e9 plus tard. Pr\u00e8s d'un an apr\u00e8s, soit le 19 juillet 1962, on \u00e9crivit de nouveau \u00e0 l'appelant pour lui dire qu'il lui faudra d\u00e9placer la maison avec annexes et le hangar.\nL'intim\u00e9, dans son factum, soutient que le Ministre ne peut \u00eatre tenu de payer les frais de d\u00e9placement que des b\u00e2timents dont il a requis le changement de site. (C.P.C. 1066x) (vide lettre du 19 juillet 1962). M. Nichols, avocat conseil du Ministre, a surtout insist\u00e9 sur ce point dans sa plaidoirie.\nCeci ne pourrait affecter que la porcherie, car l'intim\u00e9 a demand\u00e9 seulement le d\u00e9placement de la maison et du hangar. En ce qui concerne la grange, la R\u00e9gie n'a accord\u00e9 que des dommages au montant de $1,625, malgr\u00e9 que dans son offre d\u00e9taill\u00e9e du 17 avril 1963, l'intim\u00e9 n'offre rien pour la grange. La R\u00e9gie a accord\u00e9 un montant global de $600 pour la porcherie et le hangar, deux b\u00e2timents qu'il faut n\u00e9cessairement d\u00e9placer pour que cette terre soit exploit\u00e9e avec profit. La raison est facile \u00e0 comprendre, car si on d\u00e9place la maison, comme il est essentiel de le faire, et on la transporte au nord de la route nouvelle, il sera n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9placer plus au nord les b\u00e2timents qui se trouvent actuellement \u00e0 vingt-cinq ou trente pieds de la route transcanadienne.\nM. Dorval, expert entendu devant la R\u00e9gie, dit que la situation des lieux ne permet pas le d\u00e9placement de la maison r\u00e9sidentielle sans envisager forc\u00e9ment le d\u00e9placement de l'ensemble des autres b\u00e2tisses sur une distance d'environ cent pieds, afin de remettre M. Jutras dans le m\u00eame \u00e9tat qu'avant l'expropriation. \u00c9videmment, \u00e0 moins que ce recul ne soit effectu\u00e9, il n'y a aucune place pour reculer la maison vers le nord, mais l'intim\u00e9 a requis qu'on d\u00e9place le hangar seulement afin de trouver un endroit voulu pour y placer la maison. C'est bien M. Sylvio Hudon, expert de l'intim\u00e9 expropriant, qui nous dit dans son t\u00e9moignage que vu qu'il fallait d\u00e9placer la maison, le minist\u00e8re a pens\u00e9 de trouver un site convenable \u00e0 l'expropri\u00e9 et on a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de lui octroyer une indemnit\u00e9 pour le d\u00e9placement du hangar, et il ajoute que c'est en vue de trouver un endroit convenable pour la maison qu'il faut n\u00e9cessairement d\u00e9placer le hangar.\nAvec ce plan, con\u00e7u par les experts de l'intim\u00e9, la maison sera voisine de la porcherie avec ses habitants peu enviables et avec quarante b\u00eates \u00e0 cornes qui logent dans l'\u00e9table. Il est clair qu'on n'y a pas pens\u00e9 et qu'on n'a pas voulu sugg\u00e9rer \u00e0 M. Jutras de violer la loi, car aucune porcherie ne peut, en vertu d'un r\u00e8glement d'hygi\u00e8ne (Arr\u00eat\u00e9-en-conseil du 12 f\u00e9vrier 1944) \u00eatre construit \u00e0 moins de cent cinquante pieds d'une maison d'habitation au sous peine d'une amende de vingt dollars par jour. Il faudra donc reculer la porcherie et le hangar pour y placer la maison et pour effectuer ce travail la R\u00e9gie n'a accord\u00e9 que la somme de $600.\nA mon avis, ce montant est manifestement insuffisant. Il s'agit d'une porcherie de bonnes dimensions, construite sur des fondations en b\u00e9ton et sur lesquelles repose un plancher \u00e9galement en b\u00e9ton. Si l'indemnit\u00e9 pour reculer le hangar est de $200 environ, comme je crois qu'elle doit l'\u00eatre, il ne resterait que $400 pour reculer la porcherie. Ceci ne serait pas m\u00eame suffisant pour payer le ciment n\u00e9cessaire pour faire des fondations nouvelles \u00e0 cent cinquante pieds de la maison d'habitation.\nS'il est vrai que l'intim\u00e9 n'est pas tenu de payer les frais de d\u00e9placement de la porcherie, parce que le Ministre n'a pas requis qu'elle soit d\u00e9plac\u00e9e, il doit tout de m\u00eame payer les dommages qui r\u00e9sultent de l'expropriation, et ces dommages sont, \u00e0 mon avis, \u00e9gaux au co\u00fbt du d\u00e9placement. C'est ainsi qu'on l'a compris au proc\u00e8s. Les experts de l'intim\u00e9 ont reconnu que la porcherie subissait des dommages, de m\u00eame que la R\u00e9gie et la Cour d'Appel qui ont accord\u00e9 pour cet item et le hangar la somme de $600.\nJe crois donc que ce montant de $600 accord\u00e9 pour la porcherie et le hangar n'est pas suffisant. Qu'il s'agisse de d\u00e9placer la porcherie ou de dommages caus\u00e9s \u00e0 l'appelant par suite de l'expropriation, je suis d'opinion que le montant propos\u00e9 par l'expert Lemieux et accept\u00e9 par MM. les Juges Badeaux et Rivard devrait \u00eatre ajout\u00e9 \u00e0 l'indemnit\u00e9 accord\u00e9e par la R\u00e9gie.\nEn cons\u00e9quence, je maintiendrais l'appel et j'accorderais, en outre du montant fix\u00e9 par la R\u00e9gie, une somme additionnelle de $5,150. L'appelant aura droit aux frais encourus devant toutes les Cours.\nLe Juge Judson souscrit au jugement rendu par\nLE JUGE FAUTEUX:\u2014Le 23 mars 1960, Lorenzo Jutras acheta, dans la r\u00e9gion de Ste-Eulalie, comt\u00e9 de Nicolet, une ferme de 158 arpents, payant, pour le terrain et les modestes b\u00e2timents y \u00e9rig\u00e9s, un prix de $5,714.07. Dix-huit mois plus tard, le minist\u00e8re de la Voirie expropria, aux fins de la construction de la route transcanadienne, une lisi\u00e8re de ce terrain, ayant une superficie de moins de un pour cent de la superficie totale de la terre. \u00c9rig\u00e9e sur cette lisi\u00e8re, la maison de Jutras dut \u00e9videmment \u00eatre d\u00e9plac\u00e9e et d\u00e8s lors on envisagea comme cons\u00e9quence la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de r\u00e9am\u00e9nager ou d\u00e9placer les autres b\u00e2timents de la ferme, soit grange, porcherie et petite remise, tous situ\u00e9s \u00e0 une certaine proximit\u00e9 de la lisi\u00e8re expropri\u00e9e. Pour cette parcelle de terrain, r\u00e9am\u00e9nagement, d\u00e9placement et autres item de peu d'importance, le minist\u00e8re de la Voirie offrit \u00e0 l'expropri\u00e9 une indemnit\u00e9 de $7,235 alors que ce dernier r\u00e9clamait $23,865.90. La d\u00e9termination de l'indemnit\u00e9 fut donc r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 la R\u00e9gie des Services publics. Apr\u00e8s avoir vu et entendu les t\u00e9moins de part et d'autre, s'\u00eatre rendus sur les lieux et les avoir visit\u00e9s, les membres de la R\u00e9gie accord\u00e8rent \u00e0 l'appelant une indemnit\u00e9 de $7,490.70 \u00ab \u2026 pour lui tenir lieu de la valeur du terrain expropri\u00e9 et de tous les dommages r\u00e9sultant de l'expropriation\u2026 \u00bb. Jutras en appela. Il demanda \u00e0 la Cour d'Appel d'ajouter $5,750 \u00e0 la somme de $600 accord\u00e9e pour le d\u00e9placement de la porcherie et de la petite remise. Il demanda \u00e9galement d'ajouter $7,500 \u00e0 la somme de $1,625,\u2014somme qui lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e pour le r\u00e9am\u00e9nagement de la grange,\u2014pr\u00e9tendant que celle-ci devait \u00eatre d\u00e9plac\u00e9e plut\u00f4t que d'\u00eatre r\u00e9am\u00e9nag\u00e9e. Par une d\u00e9cision majoritaire,\u2014la majorit\u00e9 \u00e9tant form\u00e9e de messieurs les juges Hyde, Taschereau et Owen,\u2014la Cour d'Appel[4] confirma l'ordonnance de la R\u00e9gie. Dissidents, messieurs les juges Badeaux et Rivard furent d'avis que la r\u00e9clamation de l'appelant relative \u00e0 la porcherie \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e; ils auraient, quant \u00e0 cet item seulement, modifi\u00e9 l'ordonnance et accord\u00e9 un montant additionnel de $5,150. Jutras en appelle maintenant \u00e0 cette Cour.\nC'est la pr\u00e9tention de Jutras, bas\u00e9e particuli\u00e8rement sur l'opinion de son t\u00e9moin, Guy Hamel, qu'il ne suffit pas de faire des modifications \u00e0 la grange, mais qu'il faut la d\u00e9placer comme les autres b\u00e2timents. Et il invoque le t\u00e9moignage d'un autre de ses t\u00e9moins, soit George Lemieux, qui se d\u00e9crit comme \u00ab entrepreneur et sp\u00e9cialiste en d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement de maisons \u00bb, suivant qui, le co\u00fbt de d\u00e9placement de tous ces b\u00e2timents s'\u00e9l\u00e8verait \u00e0 $14,575 d\u00e9taill\u00e9 comme suit:\nPour la grange\n$ 7,500.00\nPour la porcherie\n5,300.00\nPour la remise\n450.00\nImpr\u00e9vus (10%)\n1,325.00\nTotal\n14,575.00\nUne lecture attentive des t\u00e9moignages de Guy Hamel et de Georges Lemieux justifie, je crois, le bien-fond\u00e9 des commentaires d\u00e9favorables faits \u00e0 leur \u00e9gard par les juges de la majorit\u00e9 en Cour d'Appel. A l'instar de ces derniers, je ne m'\u00e9tonne aucunement que les membres de la R\u00e9gie, qui, outre d'avoir eu l'avantage d'observer ces t\u00e9moins, ont subs\u00e9quemment visit\u00e9 les lieux, n'aient pr\u00eat\u00e9 peu d'attention, si aucune, \u00e0 leurs t\u00e9moignages. A cela on peut ajouter que les juges dissidents, eux-m\u00eames, ont refus\u00e9 d'accepter l'opinion du t\u00e9moin Hamel, jugeant contrairement \u00e0 celui-ci, qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9placer la grange. Comme leurs coll\u00e8gues de la majorit\u00e9, ils furent d'avis qu'il n'y avait pas lieu d'intervenir pour augmenter le montant accord\u00e9 par la R\u00e9gie pour y faire les changements requis et compenser l'expropri\u00e9 des inconv\u00e9nients qu'il pouvait subir quant \u00e0 ce chef de la r\u00e9clamation. Il est aussi remarquable, en ce qui concerne les frais de d\u00e9placement de la porcherie et de la petite remise, que le montant sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 par Lemieux, simplement pour d\u00e9placer la porcherie, soit presque neuf fois celui estim\u00e9 par la R\u00e9gie pour le d\u00e9placement de la porcherie et de la petite remise. C'est l\u00e0 un \u00e9cart consid\u00e9rable et, en soi, assez inexplicable. L'appelant, dans son factum, argumente que la porcherie est un b\u00e2timent important, construit sur une base de b\u00e9ton et poss\u00e9dant un plancher en b\u00e9ton. Cependant, le seul \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve auquel il nous r\u00e9f\u00e8re dans son factum pour justifier cette affirmation,\u2014et je n'en ai trouv\u00e9 aucun autre relatif \u00e0 ce point,\u2014est une photo montrant uniquement l'ext\u00e9rieur de ce b\u00e2timent et ne permettant, en cons\u00e9quence, d'en apercevoir le plancher. En tout respect pour les juges dissidents, qui font \u00e9tat du fait que la preuve \u00e9tablirait que la porcherie poss\u00e8de un plancher en b\u00e9ton, je dois dire qu'il y a l\u00e0 une m\u00e9prise car il n'y a aucune preuve au dossier \u00e0 cet effet. De plus et en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la porcherie et au hangar, voici ce qu'en disent les membres de la R\u00e9gie, en exprimant l'opinion qu'ils se sont form\u00e9e, sur l'am\u00e9nagement et le d\u00e9placement des b\u00e2timents, apr\u00e8s avoir entendu les t\u00e9moignages et visit\u00e9 les lieux:\nApr\u00e8s avoir entendu les t\u00e9moignages, \u00e9tudi\u00e9 les plans et visit\u00e9 les lieux, la R\u00e9gie croit que l'int\u00e9ress\u00e9, en d\u00e9pla\u00e7ant sa porcherie et son hangar, qui, incidemment, ont peu de valeur, pourra trouver un site convenable pour sa maison par rapport au chemin de service qui sera \u00e9ventuellement construit et qu'en effectuant certaines modifications \u00e0 sa grange, il placera sa ferme dans une position aussi avantageuse apr\u00e8s qu'avant l'expropriation.\nTenant compte de toute la preuve au dossier et des observations qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, aussi bien que des principes qui doivent guider les tribunaux d'appel appel\u00e9s \u00e0 reviser les d\u00e9cisions rendues par la R\u00e9gie dans l'exercice de sa juridiction arbitrale en mati\u00e8re d'expropriation, je dirais, qu'\u00e0 mon avis et en tout respect pour l'opinion contraire, il n'y a aucune raison de droit ou de fait justifiant, en l'esp\u00e8ce, de modifier l'ordonnance de la R\u00e9gie pour faire droit aux pr\u00e9tentions de l'appelant.\nJe renverrais l'appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nJudson J. concurred with the judgment delivered by\nABBOTT J.:\u2014This appeal is from a majority judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench[5], affirming a judgment of the Superior Court dated June 3, 1963, which homologated a decision of the Public Service Board awarding the appellant $7,490.70, as compensation for the expropriation of a small portion of a farm property owned by him and situated at Ste-Eulalie in the District of Nicolet.\nAs of September 18, 1961, the Government of the Province of Quebec notified appellant under the provisions of arts. 1066a and following of the Code of Civil Procedure that it intended to expropriate a small strip on the front of the said property (comprising 1.172 arpents out of a total area of 158 arpents) for the purpose of constructing the Trans-Canada Highway. The house in which appellant lived was located on the strip to be expropriated, but the provincial authorities notified appellant under art. 1066x C.C.P. that the government did not intend to acquire the house, which should be removed. Art. 1066x reads:\n1066x. The Minister may, in the description of the expropriated immoveable, or by written notice to the expropriated party, declare that he does not intend to acquire certain constructions which are on the land required, but intends to oblige the expropriated party to remove them. The expropriated party must, in such case, effect the removal within thirty days from the notice given to him by registered letter, unless, upon petition, the Board order otherwise. If the work of removal be not undertaken within fifteen days from the notice nor be terminated within the required delay, the Minister may cause it to be done and the constructions to be placed on the expropriated party's land at the place deemed most convenient.\nThe remainder of the farm buildings, consisting of a barn, piggery and shed, were not located on the property to be expropriated but are close to the new boundary line.\nOn March 23, 1960, some eighteen months prior to the notice of expropriation, appellant had purchased the entire property with the buildings in question, for $5,714,07. There was evidence, based on recent sales of similar farms in the vicinity, that the market value of the appellant's farm and buildings at the date of expropriation was approximately $7,000.\nThe Public Service Board fixed the indemnity payable to appellant under art. 1066L of the Code of Civil Procedure at the sum of $7,490.70.\nIn his appeal to this Court, appellant asked that the amount of the award be increased to $19,840.70, the principal justification for the increased amount claimed, being the alleged cost of moving the farm buildings (other than the farm-house itself) to a more suitable location.\nThe principles to be followed by appellate tribunals in a case of this kind, were authoritatively laid down by the Judicial Committee in Cedar Rapids Manufacturing and Power Company v. Lacoste[6], as follows:\nTheir Lordships now have to consider the main question, viz., was the Court below justified in setting aside the present awards and remitting the matter to the arbitrators?\nThe law and practice of the Province of Quebec governing the procedure of the Court in such matters appear to be in all essentials the same as in this country. Although the appeal is a rehearing, a verdict of a jury or an award of an arbitrator acting within his jurisdiction is not in general set aside unless it is shown that the jury or the arbitrator proceeded on an erroneous view of the law, or that there was no evidence on which the verdict or the award could properly be arrived at, or that there was some manifest error leading to the result. There might also, of course, be some other matter in the conduct of the proceedings such as the wrongful admission or rejection of evidence which might vitiate the result. But as a general rule the Court does not set aside a verdict or an award merely on the ground that it is against the weight of evidence.\nThe question of the amount of compensation is one peculiarly for the arbitrators\u2014in this case the Public Service Board. On such a question the arbitrators are entitled to form their own opinion and are not bound to accept any of the figures put before them in evidence; see Cedar v. Lacoste, supra, at pp. 284-285. Compensation for the relatively small portion of land taken is not in issue. So far as the damages sustained as a result of the expropriation are concerned, the appellant is entitled to be fully compensated but not enriched thereby.\nI agree with the conclusion reached by the majority in the Court below that it has not been shown that the Public Service Board proceeded upon an erroneous view of the law, or that there was no evidence on which the award could properly be arrived at or any manifest error leading to the result. On the contrary I share the view expressed by Hyde J. that with the cash award of the $7,490.70 and residue of his property after the taking of less than one per cent of his land, the appellant is more than adequately compensated for what was taken and any damages resulting therefrom.\nFor the foregoing reasons and as well as for those given by Taschereau and Owen JJ. with which I am in agreement, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppel rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens, le JUGE EN CHEF TASCHEREAU et le JUGE SPENCE \u00e9tant dissidents.\nProcureurs de l'appelant: Marquis, Marceau & Jessop, Qu\u00e9bec.\nProcureur des intim\u00e9s: A.

Le jour suivant, le d\u00e9fendeur a consenti \u00e0 un nomm\u00e9 Cobrin une option dans laquelle il s'engageait \u00e0 lui vendre le terrain en question. Cette option contenait une stipulation \u00e0 l'effet que l'option vaudrait en faveur de Cobrin ou de toute autre personne d\u00e9sign\u00e9e par lui. Subs\u00e9quemment, Cobrin a d\u00e9sign\u00e9 Germain comme \u00e9tant la personne pouvant exercer l'option. Deux promesses de vente sont alors intervenues le 23 octobre 1959, la premi\u00e8re du d\u00e9fendeur \u00e0 Germain pour un prix de $150,000 et la seconde de Germain \u00e0 Cobrin et associ\u00e9s pour un prix de $210,000. Finalement, le 12 d\u00e9cembre 1959, trois actes de vente ont \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9s devant le m\u00eame notaire: le premier du d\u00e9fendeur \u00e0 Ovide Jolicoeur Inc. pour un prix de $103,879.10, le second de Ovide Jolicoeur Inc. \u00e0 Germain pour un prix de $150,000 et le troisi\u00e8me de Germain \u00e0 Cobrin et associ\u00e9s pour un prix de $210,000. Le d\u00e9fendeur a refus\u00e9 de payer la commission pour le motif, entre autres, que le mandat avait pris fin lorsque la demanderesse, par le truchement de son repr\u00e9sentant, avait acquis les biens qu'elle avait charge de vendre. La Cour sup\u00e9rieure et la. Cour d'Appel ont maintenu l'action pour la commission. Le d\u00e9fendeur en appela devant cette Cour.\nArr\u00eat: L'appel doit \u00eatre maintenu, les Juges Cartwright et Fauteux \u00e9tant dissidents.\nLe Juge en chef 'Taschereau et les Juges Hall et Spence: En vertu des articles 1484 et 1713 du Code Civil, l'achat par Germain, tant qu'il \u00e9tait le mandataire du d\u00e9fendeur, ne pouvait avoir lieu. Germain n'\u00e9tait pas le pr\u00eate-nom de Cobrin mais agissait personnellement et comme repr\u00e9sentant de la demanderesse. De plus, lorsque Germain est devenu acqu\u00e9reur, le mandat a n\u00e9cessairement pris fin de m\u00eame que le droit \u00e0 la commission.\nLe Juge Cartwright, dissident: Les deux Cours inf\u00e9rieures en sont venues \u00e0 la conclusion que Germain, en achetant et revendant le terrain en question, n'avait pas agi personnellement ou pour son propre b\u00e9n\u00e9fice ou celui de la demanderesse, mais au contraire comme pr\u00eate-nom de Cobrin et seulement pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de Cobrin. Le d\u00e9fendeur n'a pas avanc\u00e9 de motifs ayant suffisamment de force pour que cette Cour change ces conclusions de fait.\nLe Juge Fauteux, dissident: Le jugement dont est appel \u00e9tait bien fond\u00e9.\nContracts\u2014Agency\u2014Real estate\u2014Commission\u2014Purchase of property by brokers\u2014Pr\u00eate-nom\u2014Civil Code, arts. 1484, 1706, 1713.\nBy contract dated October 6, 1959, the defendant agreed to pay to the plaintiff or its representative Germain a commission if Germain effected the sale of his property to the plaintiff's client for $150,000. The next day, the defendant gave to one Cobrin an option to purchase the property which contained a clause that the option could be exercised by Cobrin or by any other person designated by him. Subsequently, Cobrin designated Germain as the person to exercise the option. On October 23, 1959, two promises of sale were executed, the first from the defendant to Germain for a price of $150,000 and the second from Germain to Cobrin and his associates for a price of $210,000. Finally, on December 12, 1959, three deeds of sale were passed before the same notary: the first from the defendant to Ovide Jolicoeur Inc. for a price of $103,879.10, the second from Ovide Jolicoeur Inc. to Germain for a price of $150,000 and the third from Germain to Cobrin and his associates for a price of $210,000. The defendant has refused to pay the commission on the ground, inter alia, that the plaintiff had terminated the mandate when, through its representative, it acquired the property which it had undertaken to sell. The Superior Court and the Court of Appeal maintained the action for the commission. The defendant appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Cartwright and Fauteux JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.\nPer Taschereau C.J. and Hall and Spence JJ.: By virtue of articles 1484 and 1713 of the Civil Code, the purchase by Germain, as long as he was the mandatary of the defendant, could not take place. Germain was not the pr\u00eate-nom of Cobrin but was acting personally and as the representative of the plaintiff. Furthermore, when Germain became the purchaser, the mandate was necessarily terminated as well as the right to a commission.\nPer Cartwright J., dissenting: The Courts below have found that in taking the deed of the property and in reselling, Germain was acting not personally or for his own benefit or for that of the plaintiff but as pr\u00eate-nom of Cobrin and solely for Cobrin's benefit. No sufficient ground has been shown to warrant interfering with these concurrent findings of fact.\nPer Fauteux J., dissenting: The judgment of the Court below was well-founded.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec[1] , affirming a judgment of Marquis J.

Cobrin une option dans laquelle il s'engageait \u00e0 lui vendre le terrain ci-dessus mentionn\u00e9 au prix de $155,000. En vertu de cette option, l'appelant Jolicoeur s'engageait \u00e0 respecter la convention du 6 octobre 1959 (soit celle relative \u00e0 la commission qui devait \u00eatre pay\u00e9e). Par cette convention du 6 octobre la commission \u00e9tait payable \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e ou au mis-en-cause, Jacques Germain, et l'appelant a reconnu que si une commission est due, elle l'est \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e qui a agi par l'entremise du mis-en-cause. C'est pourquoi l'option mentionne la convention du 6 octobre 1959 intervenue avec M. Jacques Germain. II est important de ne pas oublier que cette option d'achat en faveur de Simon Cobrin stipule que cette option d'achat peut \u00eatre exerc\u00e9e par M.

J'agissais pour la Centrale d'Immeubles Ste-Foye Inc.\nII ne fait donc aucun doute quelconque que Germain, le vice-pr\u00e9sident de la compagnie intim\u00e9e et son agent autoris\u00e9, \u00e9tait le v\u00e9ritable repr\u00e9sentant de la compagnie intim\u00e9e.\nMais, il est arriv\u00e9 par les trois ventes suivantes, ce qui suit: Ovide Jolicoeur, l'appelant, a vendu, le 12 d\u00e9cembre 1959, \u00e0 Ovide Jolicoeur Inc. et, le m\u00eame jour, devant le m\u00eame notaire, il y a une vente de Ovide Jolicoeur Inc. \u00e0 Jacques Germain, et \u00e9galement le m\u00eame jour, soit le 12 d\u00e9cembre 1959, une vente de Jacques Germain \u00e0 Covin Development Corporation, repr\u00e9sentant les int\u00e9r\u00eats Cobrin. Je dois dire que ces ventes successives, et toutes ex\u00e9cut\u00e9es le m\u00eame jour, me paraissent \u00e9tranges. II r\u00e9sulte de tout ceci que l'appelant Jolicoeur, qui avait nomm\u00e9 l'intim\u00e9e ou Germain comme agents pour vendre cet immeuble, a re\u00e7u $150,000, et que l'intim\u00e9e et Germain ont touch\u00e9 $210,000, soit un profit de $60,000.\nOr, il me semble clair, en vertu des dispositions du Code Civil, arts. 1484 et 1713, qu'un semblable achat par Germain, tant qu'il est mandataire de Jolicoeur, ne peut avoir lieu. L'article 1484 se lit de la fa\u00e7on suivante:\n1484. Ne peuvent se rendre acqu\u00e9reurs, ni par eux-m\u00eames ni par parties interpos\u00e9es, les personnes suivantes, savoir:\nLes tuteurs et curateurs, des biens de ceux dont ils ont la tutelle ou la curatelle, except\u00e9 dans le cas de vente par autorit\u00e9 judiciaire;\nLes mandataires, des biens qu'ils sont charg\u00e9s de vendre;\nLes administrateurs ou syndics, des biens qui leur sont confi\u00e9s, soit que ces biens appartiennent \u00e0 des corps publics ou \u00e0 des particuliers;\nLes officiers publics, des biens nationaux dont la vente se fait par leur minist\u00e8re.\nL'incapacit\u00e9 \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans cet article ne peut \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9e par l'acheteur; elle n'existe qu'en faveur du propri\u00e9taire ou autre partie ayant un int\u00e9r\u00eat dans la chose vendue.\nL'article 1713 est ainsi r\u00e9dig\u00e9:\n1713. Le mandataire est tenu de rendre compte de sa gestion, et de remettre et payer au mandant tout ce qu'il a re\u00e7u sous l'autorit\u00e9 de son mandat, m\u00eame si ce qu'il a re\u00e7u n'\u00e9tait pas d\u00fb au mandant; sauf n\u00e9anmoins son droit de d\u00e9duire du montant, ses d\u00e9bours\u00e9s et son d\u00fb \u00e0 raison de l'ex\u00e9cution du mandat. Si, ce qu'il a re\u00e7u est une chose d\u00e9termin\u00e9e, il a droit de la retenir jusqu'au remboursement.\nDans Dalloz Hebdomadaire 1934, p. 511, on lit ce qui suit:\nAttendu qu'aux termes de l'article 1993 C.C. (notre article 1713), le mandataire est tenu de faire raison au mandant de tout ce qu'il a re\u00e7u en vertu de sa procuration, quand m\u00eame ce qu'il a re\u00e7u n'e\u00fbt point \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00fb au mandant; que ce principe trouve son application en l'esp\u00e8ce, les sommes pay\u00e9es en sus du tarif ayant, aux termes des constatations de l'arr\u00eat, \u00e9t\u00e9, en d\u00e9pit de l'erreur commise par les d\u00e9biteurs sur l'\u00e9tendue de leur dette, vers\u00e9es volontairement par Hartmann en sa qualit\u00e9 de mandataire et en vue de leur remise \u00e0 la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration; d'o\u00f9 il suit qu'en faisant application au pr\u00e9venu des dispositions de l'article 408 C. p\u00e9n., la Cour de Colmar n'a viol\u00e9 aucun des textes vis\u00e9s au moyen.\nBeaudry-Lacantinerie, Droit Civil, 'De la Vente et de l'\u00c9change', 3e \u00e9dition, \u00e0 la page 242, dit ceci:\n\u2026l est \u00e0 peine besoin de dire qu'il ne pourrait pas jouer \u00e0 la fois le double r\u00f4le de vendeur et d'acheteur\u2026 Il est incapable d'acheter les biens qu'il est charg\u00e9 de vendre. Dans la cause qui nous occupe, Jolicoeur avait confi\u00e9 un mandat \u00e0 Germain de vendre pour la somme finalement fix\u00e9e \u00e0 $150,000, et il s'est engag\u00e9 \u00e0 lui payer la commission mentionn\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment. Comme cons\u00e9quence de ventes successives Jacques Germain a vendu \u00e0 Covin Development Co. pour $210,000, et a fait un profit de $60,000 au d\u00e9triment de Jolicoeur. Il a donc \u00e9t\u00e9 l'acheteur, quand Jolicoeur lui a vendu, du lot 26 qu'il avait mission de vendre, et a r\u00e9alis\u00e9 le profit en question quand il a vendu \u00e0 Covin Development. Les articles 1484 et 1713 lui interdisent de faire de semblables transactions et de servir deux ma\u00eetres. Seul Jolicoeur pouvait invoquer l'interdiction prononc\u00e9e par l'article 1484. Enfin, je suis bien certain que Jolicoeur ignorait le profit que r\u00e9alisait ou devait r\u00e9aliser Germain.\nOn demande \u00e0 Germain, le vice-pr\u00e9sident de l'intim\u00e9e:\nD. Alors de qui \u00e9tiez-vous le pr\u00eate-nom ou le repr\u00e9sentant?\nR. De messieurs Cobrin.\nGermain admet qu'il est la personne d\u00e9sign\u00e9e pour exercer l'option, et cependant ailleurs dans son t\u00e9moignage, il affirme que lui ou la Centrale d'Immeubles Ste-Foye a re\u00e7u de l'appelant le mandat, moyennant le paiement d'une commission, de vendre le terrain en question. Il se trouve \u00e0 la fois l'agent du vendeur Jolicoeur et le repr\u00e9sentant des acheteurs Cobrin (C.C. 1706).\nIl est clair qu'il y a l\u00e0 conflit et que Germain, vice-pr\u00e9sident de l'intim\u00e9e, ne peut, dans ces conditions, servir avec fid\u00e9lit\u00e9 les int\u00e9r\u00eats de Jolicoeur. D'ailleurs, les \u00e9v\u00e9nements ont prouv\u00e9 que pour Germain, les int\u00e9r\u00eats des Cobrin et le sien, \u00e9taient sup\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 ceux de Jolicoeur. Ce dernier consent de payer une g\u00e9n\u00e9reuse commission si on vend son terrain, et, cependant, Germain lui fait r\u00e9duire son prix \u00e0 $150,000, alors qu'il devait recevoir $155,000. Germain se fait d\u00e9signer par les Cobrin pour exercer l'option, et revend \u00e0 ces derniers pour $210,000, soit un profit de $60,000 dont Jolicoeur a \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9. Germain n'a pas scrupuleusement rempli son devoir vis-\u00e0-vis Jolicoeur. Ce dernier peut donc dire avec raison qu'il n'aurait jamais accept\u00e9 la derni\u00e8re clause, s'il s'\u00e9tait dout\u00e9 que la personne d\u00e9sign\u00e9e par Simon Cobrin pour exercer l'option, serait son propre agent et mandataire.\nCeci est confirm\u00e9 par un fait r\u00e9v\u00e9lateur des intentions de Germain. Quand on a, le m\u00eame jour, sign\u00e9 plusieurs actes inutiles, Jolicoeur et Gendron (ce dernier secr\u00e9taire d'Ovide Jolicoeur Incorpor\u00e9e), ont assist\u00e9 \u00e0 la lecture de deux des actes, mais furent invit\u00e9s \u00e0 se retirer sans qu'on leur lise les autres contrats, et en particulier l'acte de vente de Germain \u00e0 Covin Development, o\u00f9 le prix de vente \u00e9tait fix\u00e9 \u00e0 $210,000, on voulait \u00e9videmment cacher \u00e0 Jolicoeur que, le 12 d\u00e9cembre, il avait vendu pour $150,000 et que, le m\u00eame jour, Germain revendait pour $210,000 le bien qui faisait l'objet de son mandat. Il r\u00e9alisait ainsi un profit de $60,000 dont Jolicoeur a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pouill\u00e9. Germain a mieux servi ses propres int\u00e9r\u00eats et ceux des Cobrin, que ceux de son mandant qui avait repos\u00e9 sa confiance en lui. Germain voulait hors la connaissance de Jolicoeur sp\u00e9culer sur l'acquisition d'un droit qu'il \u00e9tait charg\u00e9 de prot\u00e9ger et de vendre pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de l'appelant.\nGermain pr\u00e9tend qu'il \u00e9tait le pr\u00eate-nom ou le repr\u00e9sentant des Cobrin. Il l'affirme sous serment dans son t\u00e9moignage. Ces deux appellations n'ont pas la m\u00eame signification. Mais, quoi qu'il en soit, on ajoute qu'il n'a pas achet\u00e9 personnellement et n'a pas viol\u00e9 les dispositions de l'art. 1484 C.C. Admettre cette pr\u00e9tention c'est mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 l'art. 1030 C.C. qui veut qu'on est cens\u00e9 stipuler pour soi-m\u00eame et ses h\u00e9ritiers, \u00e0 moins que le contraire ne soit exprim\u00e9 ou ne r\u00e9sulte de la nature du contrat. Dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, les actes d\u00e9montrent que Germain a agi personnellement; il a sign\u00e9 de son nom tous les actes o\u00f9 il appara\u00eet, sans jamais d\u00e9voiler un principal, s'il en a un. Quand il a vendu \u00e0 Covin Development, il reconna\u00eet avoir re\u00e7u en acompte sur le prix de vente la somme de $90,000, pour laquelle il a donn\u00e9 quittance; quant \u00e0 la balance, elle est, en vertu de l'acte de vente, payable partie \u00e0 la compagnie intim\u00e9e, la centrale d'Immeubles Ste-Foye Inc., dont Germain est le vice-pr\u00e9sident, et partie \u00e0 Ovide Jolicoeur, pour compl\u00e9ter le prix de vente de $150,000 sur lequel il n'avait re\u00e7u qu'un acompte de $30,000.\nOn voit donc de toute \u00e9vidence que Germain n'\u00e9tait pas pr\u00eate-nom et ne repr\u00e9sentait pas les Cobrin, mais qu'il agissait personnellement et comme repr\u00e9sentant de l'intim\u00e9e, \u00e0 qui pr\u00e8s de $100,000 doivent \u00eatre pay\u00e9s. De plus, c'est lui qui se fait donner la promesse du 23 octobre 1959, et qui se fait consentir la vente du 12 d\u00e9cembre. Rien ne d\u00e9montre dans les actes que Germain n'a pas agi personnel- lement, et la nature du contrat ne d\u00e9truit pas la pr\u00e9somption cr\u00e9\u00e9e par l'art. 1030 C.C. En outre, l'art. 1210 C.C. est \u00e0 l'effet que les actes authentiques font preuve compl\u00e8te entre les parties de l'obligation qui y est exprim\u00e9e.\nQuand Germain dit qu'il est pr\u00eate-nom ou repr\u00e9sentant des Cobrin, il contredit tous les \u00e9crits re\u00e7us devant notaires, et par cons\u00e9quent authentiques, et il invite les tribunaux \u00e0 fermer les yeux sur les arts. 1030 et 1210 C.C. Je ne suis pas dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 suivre cette ligne de conduite. De plus, en se disant pr\u00eate-nom ou repr\u00e9sentant des Cobrin, il fonde sa pr\u00e9tention sur une ill\u00e9galit\u00e9 (C.C. 1484), car il n'a pas plus le droit d'acheter comme repr\u00e9sentant ou pr\u00eate-nom de l'acheteur que d'\u00eatre l'acheteur lui-m\u00eame. Qu'il soit acheteur ou repr\u00e9sentant, il y a conflit d'int\u00e9r\u00eat avec le vendeur dont il est le mandataire, et c'est ce que dans sa sagesse le l\u00e9gislateur a interdit. L'article 1484 C.C. est formel et imp\u00e9ratif. Il d\u00e9fend au mandataire du vendeur d'acheter personnellement ou m\u00eame par parties interpos\u00e9es, les biens qu'il est charg\u00e9 de vendre. Enfin, si Germain \u00e9tait v\u00e9ritablement le repr\u00e9sentant des Cobrin, pourquoi revendre aux Cobrin si, par son entremise, ces derniers avaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 achet\u00e9 de Jolicoeur.\nMais il y a davantage. Quand le 12 d\u00e9cembre 1959, Ovide Jolicoeur Incorpor\u00e9e, aux droits de Ovide Jolicoeur personnellement, a vendu \u00e0 Jacques Germain le lot n0 26, le mandat de l'appelant au mis-en-cause et \u00e0 la compagnie intim\u00e9e a n\u00e9cessairement pris fin, de m\u00eame que le droit \u00e0 la commission. L'intim\u00e9e, en effet, par son vice-pr\u00e9sident Germain, agissant pour elle, a alors d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de se porter partie au contrat et acqu\u00e9reur du lot dont l'appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 le vendeur. Si le vendeur vend \u00e0 son mandataire, comme la chose est arriv\u00e9e dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, le mandat est termin\u00e9. Il n'existe plus d'agence, et l'interdiction \u00e9dict\u00e9e \u00e0 l'art. 1484 C.C. n'existe plus. L'agent cesse d'\u00eatre agent; il n'est plus le mandataire du principal, mais il est l'acheteur.\nC'est que le mandant est intervenu alors pour relever le mandataire de son incapacit\u00e9 (1484 C.C.). Le mandant confie la gestion d'une affaire licite \u00e0 un mandataire (1701 C.C.), mais il peut mettre fin \u00e0 la mission qu'il a donn\u00e9e au mandataire de vendre l'immeuble \u00e0 un tiers, en permettant au mandataire d'acheter personnellement. Alors l'id\u00e9e de mandat, d'agence, dispara\u00eet de m\u00eame que le droit \u00e0 la commission. Un vendeur ne paye pas de commission \u00e0 son acheteur. La commission est due au mandataire. En outre, l'option stipule clairement que la commission n'est due que si Germain vend \u00e0 un client, et non pas s'il ach\u00e8te personnellement.\nOn a reproch\u00e9 \u00e0 l'appelant de ne pas s'\u00eatre pr\u00e9valu de l'art. 1713 C.C. et de ne pas avoir poursuivi son agent Germain pour lui r\u00e9clamer la somme de $60,000 qui lui serait due. \u00c9videmment ce recours \u00e9tait possiblement ouvert \u00e0 Jolicoeur, mais le d\u00e9faut de ne pas avoir poursuivi ne le prive en aucune fa\u00e7on de pr\u00e9tendre avec raison qu'il ne doit pas la commission qu'on lui r\u00e9clame.\nPour ma part, je ne puis sanctionner les transactions qui sont intervenues, qui, \u00e0 mon sens, lib\u00e8rent l'appelant de l'obligation de payer la commission r\u00e9clam\u00e9e.\nJe suis d'opinion de maintenir l'appel et de rejeter l'action, avec d\u00e9pens de toutes les Cours contre l'intim\u00e9e. Il n'y aura pas de frais contre le mis-en-cause, qui n'a pas contest\u00e9 l'action.\nCARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal from a unanimous judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench[4] affirming the judgment of Marquis J. in favour of La Centrale d'Immeubles Ste-Foye Inc., hereinafter referred to as \"the respondent\", for $15,581.86 with interest and costs.\nThe facts and the terms of the relevant documents are set out in detail in the reasons of Owen J. and a comparatively brief summary will be sufficient to indicate the reasons for the conclusion at which I have arrived.\nThe respondent is engaged in the business of a real estate agent. Jacques Germain, the mis-en-cause, hereinafter referred to as \"Germain\" is the vice-president of the respondent and in all of his dealings with the appellant with which we are concerned was agent of the respondent acting within the scope of his authority.\nThe action was brought for commission agreed to be paid by the appellant to the respondent for effecting a sale of a property, lot number 26, owned by the former.\nThe appellant denies any liability to the respondent but, if he is liable, there is no dispute as to the amount. By the terms of a contract dated October 6, 1959, as modified by a rider dated October 19, 1959, the appellant agreed to pay a commission, for the amount of which judgment has been given against him, in consideration of the respondent effecting a sale of his property to one Simon Cobrin for $150,000. This sale was carried out in the following manner. The appellant gave to Simon Cobrin an option, dated October 7, 1959, to purchase the property, which contained the following clause:\nLa pr\u00e9sente option d'achat vaudra en faveur dudit M. Simon Cobrin ou de toute autre personne par lui d\u00e9sign\u00e9e;\nThe rider of October 19, 1959, referred to above, provided:\nAttendu que monsieur Cobrin, a de par son option du 7 octobre 1959 le privil\u00e8ge de d\u00e9signer une autre personne et que cette personne d\u00e9sign\u00e9e est Jacques Germain;\nJe, Ovide Jolicoeur, consens et accepte que le prix de vente mentionn\u00e9 de ($155,000.00) soit r\u00e9duit \u00e0 $150,000.00, vu que monsieur Germain, consent \u00e0 r\u00e9duire sa commission d'un montant de $5,000.00 (Cinq-mille-dollars), le tout sans pr\u00e9judice aux droits des parties concern\u00e9es.\nOn October 23, 1959, two notarial deeds, each a promise of sale of lot 26, were executed, the first from the appellant to Germain for a price of $150,000 and the second from Germain to Sam Vineberg, Morton Vineberg, Frank Cobrin and Simon Cobrin for a price of $210,000. The first of these two deeds is signed by the appellant and its final paragraph reads as follows:\nLa pr\u00e9sente promesse de vente est en ex\u00e9cution d'une option sign\u00e9e par monsieur Ovide Jolicoeur, le 7 octobre 1959, en faveur de monsieur Simon Cobrin ou de toute personne d\u00e9sign\u00e9e par lui. Monsieur Simon Cobrin intervenant aux pr\u00e9sentes, d\u00e9clare accepter ledit monsieur Jacques Germain et l'autoriser \u00e0 se pr\u00e9valoir de ladite option.\nOn December 12, 1959, three deeds of sale of lot 26 were passed before the same notary, the first from the appellant to Ovide Jolicoeur Inc. for a price of $103,879.10, the second from Ovide Jolicoeur Inc. to Germain for a price of $150,000, and the third from Germain to Covin Development Corporation (a company formed by the Cobrins and the Vinebergs) for a price of $210,000. Each of these deeds was signed by the appellant, the first and third in his personal capacity and the second as president of Ovide Jolicoeur Inc. Up to this point it would appear that the respondent as agent of the appellant effected a sale of the latter's property at the price agreed upon and would prima facie be entitled to the commission.\nIn this Court, in answer to the respondent's claim the appellant puts forward two defences. His position is concisely stated in his factum in the following words:\nL'objet du litige peut \u00eatre r\u00e9sum\u00e9 comme suit:\nLa Compagnie \u00ab La Centrale d'Immeubles Ste-Foye Inc. \u00bb a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 paiement d'une somme de $15,581.86 avec int\u00e9r\u00eat pour une commission sur la vente d'un immeuble de l'appelant-immeuble qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectivement vendu. Cette demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9e. L'appelant retient deux moyens, qui sont les suivants:\nLe mandat de vendre s'est termin\u00e9 lorsque l'intim\u00e9e, par le truchement de son agent, a acquis les biens qu'elle avait charge de vendre.\nSi le mandat ne s'est pas termin\u00e9, un profit de $60,000.00 a \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenu au d\u00e9triment de l'appelant, par la revente des biens compensant ainsi la commission d'agent \u00e0 laquelle elle pr\u00e9tend.\nAs I read the reasons for judgment in the Courts below the validity of these two defences as a matter of law is not doubted. They have been rejected because it has been found as a matter of fact that neither the respondent nor its agent Germain became the purchaser of the appellant's property or made any profit on its resale. While on the face of the relevant documents Germain, who was acting throughout within the scope of his authority as agent of the respondent, appeared to become the purchaser and to make the profit referred to, the courts below have found that in taking the deed of the property and in reselling he was acting not personally or for his own benefit or that of the respondent but as pr\u00eate-nom of Cobrin and solely for Cobrin's benefit.\nThere are clear concurrent findings of fact on this point and there is evidence to support them. In my opinion no sufficient ground has been shewn to warrant our interfering with these findings.\nFor these reasons I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nLE JUGE FAUTEUX (dissident):\u2014L'appelant se pourvoit \u00e0 l'encontre d'une d\u00e9cision unanime de la Cour du banc de la reine[5]. Cette d\u00e9cision confirme un jugement de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure condamnant l'appelant \u00e0 payer \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e une somme de $15,581.86 \u00e0 titre de commission sur la vente d'un terrain.\nA mon avis, et soit dit en toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence pour ceux qui entretiennent l'opinion contraire, le jugement a quo est bien fond\u00e9 et ce pour les raisons donn\u00e9es par M. le Juge Owen avec l'accord de ses coll\u00e8gues, raisons auxquelles je ne puis utilement ajouter.\nJe rejetterais l'appel: avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppel maintenu, les JUGES CARTWRIGHT et FAUTEUX \u00e9tant dissidents.\nProcureur du d\u00e9fendeur, appelant: Guy Hudon, Qu\u00e9bec.\nProcureurs de la demanderesse, intim\u00e9e: Bouffard, Turgeon, Larochelle, Amyot, Dery, Choquette & Lesage, Qu\u00e9bec.\nNOTE DE LA R\u00c9DACTION: Une requ\u00eate demandant une nouvelle audition de cet appel fut pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 la Cour le 26 avril 1966 et fut refus\u00e9e le m\u00eame jour.\n[1] [1964] B.R. 79.\n[2] [1964] B.R. 79.\n[3] [1964] B.R. 79.\n[4] [1964] Que.

Ce terrain n\u2019\u00e9tait pas subdivis\u00e9 en lots \u00e0 b\u00e2tir, mais son usage commercial le plus efficace \u00e9tait la subdivision et la vente de lots \u00e0 b\u00e2tir. La R\u00e9gie des Services publics a \u00e9tabli la valeur de ces lots, une fois pourvus des services essentiels, \u00e0 $0.65 le pied carr\u00e9. Ce chiffre n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9 par l\u2019expropri\u00e9e devant cette Cour. La R\u00e9gie a alors fait une d\u00e9duction de 33 pour cent pour l\u2019am\u00e9nagement des services aux lots \u00e0 subdiviser, bas\u00e9e sur sa propre exp\u00e9rience des questions de ce genre, et a accord\u00e9 la somme de $60,000. La Cour d\u2019appel a jug\u00e9 que la R\u00e9gie ne pouvait, en l\u2019absence de preuve \u00e0 cet effet devant elle, faire cette d\u00e9duction, a cass\u00e9 le jugement homologuant la d\u00e9cision de la R\u00e9gie et a accord\u00e9 $96,920. La municipalit\u00e9 en appela devant cette Cour.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel doit \u00eatre maintenu et l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 de $60,000 accord\u00e9e par la R\u00e9gie, r\u00e9tablie.\nLa R\u00e9gie \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e de faire la d\u00e9duction de 33 pour cent pour l\u2019am\u00e9nagement des services aux lots \u00e0 subdiviser, en se basant sur son exp\u00e9rience. En donnant \u00e0 la R\u00e9gie la juridiction arbitrale de fixer l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 dans tous les cas d\u2019expropriation, la l\u00e9gislature a reconnu la qualit\u00e9 d\u2019expert, la comp\u00e9tence et l\u2019exp\u00e9rience particuli\u00e8re des membres qui la composent et a voulu l\u2019utilisation, la mise en \u0153uvre de ces qualifications sp\u00e9ciales dans l\u2019exercice de cette juridiction arbitrale. Il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que la R\u00e9gie a err\u00e9 en droit ou commis une erreur manifeste en fait, en accordant la compensation en question. Expropriation\u2014Property not subdivided\u2014Indemnity based on subdivision\u2014Deduction for cost of subdivision\u2014Code of Civil Procedure, art. 1066.\nThe municipality expropriated, for use as a public park, a property belonging to the respondent. This property was not subdivided in building lots, but its most effective commercial use was the subdivision and the sale of building lots. The Public Service Board found the value of these building lots, once provided with the essential services, to be $0.65 per square foot. This figure is not contested by the respondent before this Court. The Board then made a deduction of 33 per cent for the cost of subdivision, based on its own experience in these matters, and awarded a sum of $60,000. The Court of Appeal ruled that the Board could not, in the absence of evidence to that effect, make that deduction, quashed the judgment homologating the decision of the Board and awarded $96,920. The municipality appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the indemnity of $60,000 awarded by the Board restored.\nThe Board was justified in making the deduction of 33 per cent for the cost of subdivision, relying on its own experience. By conferring on the Board an arbitrary jurisdiction to fix the indemnity in all expropriation cases, the legislature has recognized the expert knowledge, the competence and the particular experience of the members of the Board and has sought the practicable application of these special qualifications in the exercise of that jurisdiction. It has not been shown that the Board erred in law or committed a manifest error in fact, in making the award in question.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec[1], in an expropriation matter.

Cette ordonnance maintient l\u2019offre de l\u2019expropriatrice-appelante et fixe \u00e0 $60,000 avec int\u00e9r\u00eat l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 qui doit \u00eatre pay\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019expropri\u00e9e-intim\u00e9e, chaque partie payant ses frais.\nLe jugement majoritaire de la Cour d\u2019Appel fixe l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 \u00e0 $96,920 avec int\u00e9r\u00eat, le tout avec d\u00e9pens des deux Cours et de la R\u00e9gie contre l\u2019expropriatrice-appelante. Messieurs les juges Taschereau et Choquette, dissidents, auraient confirm\u00e9 l\u2019ordonnance de la R\u00e9gie.\nCette expropriation est faite par l\u2019expropriatrice-appelante, dont le droit d\u2019expropriation n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9 en l\u2019instance, pour \u00abpermettre \u00e0 l\u2019expropriante d\u2019\u00e9tablir sur les \u00e9tendues de terrain\u00bb en question \u00abun parc de loisirs dans le cadre de l\u2019organisation des loisirs pour la paroisse Notre-Dame de Foy, situ\u00e9 sur le territoire de l\u2019expropriante\u00bb. Il \u00e9tait de notori\u00e9t\u00e9 publique, depuis pr\u00e8s d\u2019un an avant la date de l\u2019expropriation, que l\u2019expropriatrice-appelante avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d\u2019acqu\u00e9rir le terrain dont il est ici question pour y installer un terrain de jeux.\nIl convient d\u2019ajouter aussi, que le terrain expropri\u00e9, ayant une superficie de 227,535 pieds carr\u00e9s, n\u2019est pas subdivis\u00e9 en lots \u00e0 b\u00e2tir, mais que, advenant une telle subdivision, la superficie exploitable convenue entre les parties serait de 166,800 pieds carr\u00e9s.\nDans son ordonnance, la R\u00e9gie a discut\u00e9 les circonstances dans lesquelles l\u2019intim\u00e9e a acquis le terrain expropri\u00e9. Le passage de l\u2019ordonnance \u00e0 ce sujet se lit ainsi qu\u2019il suit:\nDe la preuve faite, il ressort que le 22 mars 1963, MM. Paul Racine, Guy Racine et Joseph-Henri Dussault ont acquis de M. Joseph Dussault, p\u00e8re de M. Joseph-Henri Dussault, une \u00e9tendue de terrain couvrant une superficie d\u2019environ 982,000 pieds carr\u00e9s faisant partie du lot non-subdivis\u00e9 n\u00b0 81 du cadastre officiel de la paroisse de Ste-Foy, Cit\u00e9 de Ste-Foy, division d\u2019enregistrement de Qu\u00e9bec. Cette vente a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite pour la somme de $150,000.00, dont $15,000.00 comptant et le solde payable en dix versements annuels \u00e9gaux et cons\u00e9cutifs de $13,500.00 en capital, dont le premier versement devenait d\u00fb et exigible dans un an de la date d\u2019achat. Le taux d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e9tait fix\u00e9 \u00e0 4% l\u2019an. Dans le contrat de vente du 22 mars 1963, \u00able vendeur transporte aux acqu\u00e9reurs, pour consid\u00e9ration comprise dans le prix de vente\u2026 tous droits aux indemnit\u00e9s qui peuvent \u00eatre actuellement dues et qui pourront le devenir \u00e0 la suite et comme cons\u00e9quence de l\u2019expropriation par le Minist\u00e8re de la Voirie de partie du lot quatre-vingt-un (81 Ptie) dudit cadastre appartenant auparavant au vendeur\u00bb. Le contrat mentionne \u00e9galement que \u00abl\u2019immeuble vendu est \u00e9galement sujet \u00e0 un jugement d\u2019homologation rendu en faveur de la Cit\u00e9 de Ste-Foy et enregistr\u00e9 \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec sous le n\u00b0 520752 le 30 janvier 1963 le vendeur transportant tous ses droits de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 relativement \u00e0 la lisi\u00e8re ainsi affect\u00e9e\u00bb.\nLe 22 mars 1963, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Paul Racine, Guy Racine et Joseph-Henri Dussault a vendu 235,245 pieds carr\u00e9s du terrain, qu\u2019elle avait acquis le m\u00eame jour de Joseph Dussault (un peu moins du quart) \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Immobili\u00e8re Enic Inc. dans laquelle sont int\u00e9ress\u00e9s Paul Racine et Guy Racine. Suivant le contrat de vente, le prix est de $125,000.00 dont $5,000.00 pay\u00e9s comptant et le solde de $120,000.00 payable en douze versements \u00e9gaux et cons\u00e9cutifs de $10,000. Le premier versement de capital devenait d\u00fb et exigible le premier janvier 1964 et le taux d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e9tait fix\u00e9 \u00e0 4% l\u2019an.\nLe terrain vendu \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Immobili\u00e8re Enic Inc. est pratiquement celui qui appara\u00eet \u00e0 la description technique produite au dossier et que la Cit\u00e9 de Ste-Foy exproprie. A ce sujet, il importe de signaler que les autorit\u00e9s de la Cit\u00e9 de Ste-Foy, ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 mises au courant de l\u2019achat projet\u00e9 par l\u2019expropri\u00e9e, faisaient parvenir \u00e0 M. Guy Racine, pr\u00e9sident de ladite soci\u00e9t\u00e9, une offre de $60,000.00 pour l\u2019acquisition de ce terrain. Cette offre, contenue dans une lettre du greffier de la Cit\u00e9 de Ste-Foy, en date du 19 mars 1963, a \u00e9t\u00e9 produite au dossier comme exhibit I-11. Cette offre d\u2019ailleurs suit d\u2019un jour la r\u00e9solution adopt\u00e9e par les autorit\u00e9s de la Cit\u00e9 de Ste-Foy \u00e0 l\u2019effet d\u2019autoriser son procureur, Me Louis N. LaRoche, \u00e0 exproprier si les offres d\u2019achat n\u2019\u00e9taient pas accept\u00e9es par les propri\u00e9taires des lots 81 partie, 76-17 et 82-14 (exhibit P-1 du dossier de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure). Devant une telle concordance de faits relativement au terrain sous examen, la R\u00e9gie en vient logiquement \u00e0 la conclusion que la transaction de Joseph-Henri Dussault, Paul et Guy Racine \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Immobili\u00e8re Enic Inc. ne peut repr\u00e9senter la valeur r\u00e9elle de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 expropri\u00e9e, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que les int\u00e9ress\u00e9s connaissaient l\u2019imminence de l\u2019expropriation.\nApr\u00e8s avoir discut\u00e9 la preuve faite devant la R\u00e9gie par des experts, quant \u00e0 la valeur de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 expropri\u00e9e, l\u2019ordonnance se lit ainsi qu\u2019il suit:\nLa r\u00e9gie en vient \u00e0 la conclusion que les ventes les plus repr\u00e9sentatives, pour des lots subdivis\u00e9s, sur lesquelles elle peut se baser pour \u00e9tablir l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 qui doit \u00eatre accord\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019expropri\u00e9e, sont la vente \u00e0 65 cents qui appara\u00eet sur l\u2019exhibit P-9 (vente lot 82-84 en 1963) et la vente effectu\u00e9e sur le lot n\u00b0 82-14 \u00e9galement au prix de 65 cents. La R\u00e9gie adopte donc comme base le prix de 65 cents le pied carr\u00e9 pour un lot subdivis\u00e9.\nIl importe de souligner que, pour subdiviser un terrain, il faut y am\u00e9nager des rues et qu\u2019une partie d\u2019environ 25 \u00e0 30% doit \u00eatre utilis\u00e9e \u00e0 cette fin. Dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, les parties ont convenu que sur les 227,535 pieds carr\u00e9s de terrain expropri\u00e9 une superficie nette d\u2019environ 166,800 pieds carr\u00e9s pouvait \u00eatre subdivis\u00e9e en lots, apr\u00e8s avoir enlev\u00e9 la superficie requise pour les rues. Dans ce cas, la perte pour les rues s\u2019\u00e9tablit \u00e0 27%\n(227,535-166,800 = 60,735; 60,735 X 100.)\n227,535\nEn plus, l\u2019exp\u00e9rience courante a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les frais de subdivision, de mise en forme des rues, de vente, de publicit\u00e9, d\u2019arpentage, etc., se chiffrent en moyenne \u00e0 33% de la valeur des lots vendus. Compte tenu de la perte de terrain pour les rues et des frais encourus, la valeur du terrain non-subdivis\u00e9, dans le pr\u00e9sent cas, s\u2019\u00e9tablirait \u00e0 40% de celle d\u2019un lot subdivis\u00e9, soit:\nPerte pour les rues\n27%\nFrais de subdivision, etc.\n33%\n60%\nValeur nette 100%-60% =\n40%\nComme le prix de base d\u2019un lot subdivis\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9 \u00e0 65 cents le pied carr\u00e9, le lot expropri\u00e9 non-subdivis\u00e9 aurait une valeur de 26 cents le pied carr\u00e9 (40% de 65 cents). L\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour le lot expropri\u00e9 s\u2019\u00e9tablirait donc \u00e0 la somme de $59,159.10 (227,535 X 26 cents). Toutefois, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 admis que pour subdiviser son terrain, l\u2019expropri\u00e9e aurait eu \u00e0 acheter un lot adjacent subdivis\u00e9 ayant une superficie de 7,200 pieds carr\u00e9s, ce qui, \u00e0 65 cents le pied carr\u00e9, aurait entra\u00een\u00e9 un d\u00e9bours\u00e9 de $4,680.00. Ce d\u00e9bours\u00e9 doit \u00eatre soustrait de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 de $59,159.10 laissant une indemnit\u00e9 nette de $54,479.10 ($59,159.10-$4,680.00).\nLa R\u00e9gie consid\u00e8re que l\u2019offre de l\u2019expropriante au montant de $60,000.00, qui est de l\u2019ordre de 10% sup\u00e9rieur aux chiffres \u00e9tablis ci-dessus, est tout \u00e0 fait \u00e9quitable.\nLa R\u00e9gie a constat\u00e9 que l\u2019usage commercial le plus efficace auquel le terrain expropri\u00e9 pourrait \u00eatre utilis\u00e9, \u00e9tait la subdivision et la vente de lots \u00e0 b\u00e2tir. Ainsi que je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9, les parties ont convenu que, sur les 227,535 pieds carr\u00e9s de terrain expropri\u00e9, il resterait une superficie de 166,800 pieds carr\u00e9s \u00e0 subdiviser en lots \u00e0 b\u00e2tir, apr\u00e8s avoir enlev\u00e9 la superficie requise pour les rues. La R\u00e9gie a \u00e9tabli la valeur de ces lots, une fois pourvus des services usuels, etc., \u00e0 65 cents le pied carr\u00e9. Ce chiffre n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9 par l\u2019expropri\u00e9e-intim\u00e9e devant cette Cour.\nEn \u00e9tablissant l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour l\u2019expropriation de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en bloc, la R\u00e9gie a fait une d\u00e9duction bas\u00e9e sur le passage de l\u2019ordonnance qui se lit ainsi:\nEn plus, l\u2019exp\u00e9rience courante a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les frais de subdivision, de mise en forme des rues, de vente, de publicit\u00e9, d\u2019arpentage, etc., se chiffrent en moyenne \u00e0 33% de la valeur des lots vendus.\nTous les juges de la Cour du banc de la reine sont d\u2019avis que, en l\u2019absence de preuve \u00e0 cet effet devant elle, la R\u00e9gie ne pouvait pas faire la d\u00e9duction qu\u2019elle a effectu\u00e9e, bas\u00e9e simplement sur sa propre exp\u00e9rience dans les questions de ce genre.\nEn tout respect, et pour les raisons que j\u2019\u00e9num\u00e9rerai dans un instant, je ne partage pas cet avis.\nLe prix de 65 cents le pied carr\u00e9, \u00e9tabli par la R\u00e9gie, a \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9 par les juges majoritaires de la Cour du banc de la reine. Apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9duit un montant de $7,000, repr\u00e9sen- tant le co\u00fbt de l\u2019am\u00e9nagement des services requis par le terrain une fois subdivis\u00e9 qui, selon eux, \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9 d\u2019apr\u00e8s la preuve, ils ont \u00e9tabli une indemnit\u00e9 de $96,920. Pour \u00e9tablir cette somme, cependant, on n\u2019a pas tenu compte de la valeur des 60,735 pieds carr\u00e9s qui, dans la subdivision, doivent \u00eatre utilis\u00e9s pour les rues. Les juges dissidents sont d\u2019avis qu\u2019aucune preuve satisfaisante n\u2019\u00e9tablit le co\u00fbt des services en question, mais soutiennent que, d\u2019apr\u00e8s la preuve devant la R\u00e9gie, l\u2019expropri\u00e9e-intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 \u00e9tablir que le montant \u00e9tait bas\u00e9 sur des principes erron\u00e9s. Ils auraient confirm\u00e9 le jugement.\nJ\u2019adopterais l\u2019expos\u00e9 qui suit de monsieur le juge Taschereau \u00e0 la Cour du banc de la reine:\nChallies, Law of Expropriation, p. 100, dit avec raison \u00e0 ce sujet:\nThe price at which the property or part of the property expropriated was acquired may and usually does constitute cogent evidence of value.\nOr, moins d\u2019un mois avant l\u2019avis d\u2019expropriation, chacun des pieds carr\u00e9s du terrain expropri\u00e9, pour lequel l\u2019appelante r\u00e9clame une indemnit\u00e9 de 0.75 cts, ne lui avait co\u00fbt\u00e9 qu\u2019environ 0.15 cts. Comme ce dernier chiffre doit servir de base \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9valuation de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et que, par ailleurs, la R\u00e9gie a allou\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appelante un montant 0.26 cts le pied carr\u00e9, je ne puis en arriver \u00e0 la conclusion que l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 est manifestement erron\u00e9e et qu\u2019il y a lieu pour cette cour d\u2019intervenir.\nComme je l\u2019ai dit, \u00e0 mon avis et en l\u2019absence de preuve que la R\u00e9gie trouve satisfaisante, elle \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e de faire une d\u00e9duction pour l\u2019am\u00e9nagement des services aux lots \u00e0 subdiviser, etc., bas\u00e9e sur sa propre exp\u00e9rience des questions de ce genre, une exp\u00e9rience qui en fait est consid\u00e9rable.\nL\u2019article 1066f du Code de proc\u00e9dure civile prescrit que dans une expropriation comme la pr\u00e9sente, la Cour sup\u00e9rieure doit d\u00e9f\u00e9rer le dossier \u00e0 la R\u00e9gie des Services Publics comme arbitre pour fixer l\u2019indemnit\u00e9. D\u2019une fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, c\u2019est la R\u00e9gie qui fixe l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 dans tous les cas d\u2019expropriation de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019il en soit autrement prescrit par des lois particuli\u00e8res. Je suis d\u2019avis qu\u2019en conf\u00e9rant cette juridiction arbitrale \u00e0 la R\u00e9gie, la L\u00e9gislature a reconnu la qualit\u00e9 d\u2019expert, la comp\u00e9tence et l\u2019exp\u00e9rience particuli\u00e8re des membres qui la composent et voulu l\u2019utilisation, la mise en \u0153uvre de ces qualifications sp\u00e9ciales dans l\u2019exercice de cette juridiction arbitrale. Des vues similaires paraissent applicables dans les provinces de droit commun. Dans \u00abRussell on Arbitration\u00bb, 17e \u00e9d., le savant auteur s\u2019en exprime ainsi \u00e0 la page 183:\nWhere the parties employ an arbitrator who has expert knowledge, and authorize him to make use of that knowledge, it is of course proper for him to do so; and it would seem that the court will tend to presume such authority from the mere fact of employment of a specially qualified person as arbitrator.\nIn such a case it will be no objection to an award that the evidence actually tendered by the parties is insufficient to support it, if there are materials upon which the arbitrator himself could have supplied the deficiency.\nLa compensation d\u00e9termin\u00e9e par la R\u00e9gie repose sur le principe que pour chaque pied carr\u00e9 de terrain expropri\u00e9, ayant une valeur de 65 cents le pied carr\u00e9 lorsque vendu comme lot \u00e0 b\u00e2tir, doit \u00eatre d\u00e9duit\n(1) 27% par pied carr\u00e9 pour la valeur du terrain utilis\u00e9 comme rues et\n(2) 33% par pied carr\u00e9 pour les d\u00e9penses de subdivision, vente, etc.\nCe qui laisse une valeur nette de 26 cents (40% de 65 cents). Je ne puis voir d\u2019objection en droit \u00e0 cette m\u00e9thode d\u2019\u00e9valuation pour \u00e9tablir la valeur de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 enti\u00e8re avant la subdivision.\nEn mati\u00e8re d\u2019expropriation, le montant de la compensation est une question qui rel\u00e8ve particuli\u00e8rement des arbitres\u2014en l\u2019occurrence la R\u00e9gie des Services Publics. Sur une telle question, les arbitres ont droit de faire leur propre opinion et ne sont tenus d\u2019accepter aucun des chiffres mentionn\u00e9s dans la preuve faite devant elle\u2014voir Cedar Rapids Manufacturing & Power Company v. Lacoste[2]. Comme le dit Lord Warrington of Clyffe \u00e0 la page 285 \u00abthe proper amount to be awarded in such a case cannot be fixed with mathematical certainty but must be largely a matter of conjecture\u00bb. Pareillement, le juge en chef Challies dans son ouvrage \u00abThe Law of Expropriation\u00bb, 2e \u00e9d., \u00e0 la page 94, dit ce qui suit:\nOne can lay down as many rules as one likes, but in the last analysis \u2018the value of any particular expropriated property still remains to a large extent a matter of opinion\u2019. It is impossible to fix the valuation with mathematical accuracy. Je suis d\u2019opinion qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 demontr\u00e9 que la R\u00e9gie des Services Publics a err\u00e9 en droit ou commis une erreur manifeste en fait.\nJe maintiendrais l\u2019appel avec d\u00e9pens devant cette Cour et devant la Cour du banc de la reine et r\u00e9tablirais la d\u00e9cision de la R\u00e9gie accordant \u00e0 l\u2019expropri\u00e9e-intim\u00e9e la somme de $60,000 avec int\u00e9r\u00eat au taux l\u00e9gal \u00e0 compter du 16 mai 1963.\nAppel maintenu avec d\u00e9pens.\nProcureur de l\u2019appelante: L.N.

II (Qu\u00e9.), c. 67, art. 36(13), (18)\u2014Loi de l\u2019adoption, S.R.Q. 1925, c. 196.\nLe fils adoptif du demandeur fut tu\u00e9 lorsque la motocyclette qu\u2019il conduisait de l\u2019ouest \u00e0 l\u2019est est venue en collision avec un camion appartenant au d\u00e9fendeur Lamontagne et conduit dans une direction oppos\u00e9e par son pr\u00e9pos\u00e9, le d\u00e9fendeur Carri\u00e8re. L\u2019accident est survenu \u00e0 l\u2019occasion d\u2019un virage \u00e0 gauche que1 le chauffeur du camion entendait faire. Le compagnon du fils du demandeur, qui \u00e9tait assis \u00e0 l\u2019arri\u00e8re de la motocyclette, n\u2019a rien vu de ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9; il \u00e9value de 30 \u00e0 35 milles \u00e0 l\u2019heure la vitesse de la motocyclette et d\u00e9clare n\u2019avoir rien constat\u00e9 d\u2019anormal jusqu\u2019au moment de la collision. Quant au chauffeur du camion, qui \u00e9tait seul, il raconte qu\u2019il s\u2019est approch\u00e9 de l\u2019intersection \u00e0 une vitesse de 8 \u00e0 10 milles \u00e0 l\u2019heure, qu\u2019il a quitt\u00e9 sa droite pour se placer \u00e0 gauche de la ligne blanche, qu\u2019il a vu venir la motocyclette \u00e0 une vitesse de 50 milles \u00e0 l\u2019heure et que pour en assurer le passage il a immobilis\u00e9 son camion qui \u00e9tait alors compl\u00e8tement \u00e0 gauche de la ligne blanche, pour attendre pendant plusieurs secondes que la motocyclette ait pass\u00e9. Il raconte que la motocyclette, \u00e0 environ 50 pieds du camion, commen\u00e7a \u00e0 louvoyer \u00e0 gauche et \u00e0 droite de la ligne blanche et \u00e0 environ 10 pieds du camion, glissa sur le c\u00f4t\u00e9 pour venir en frapper l\u2019avant gauche. Le juge au proc\u00e8s jugea que l\u2019accident \u00e9tait imputable au chauffeur du camion et rejeta la pr\u00e9tention de la d\u00e9fense \u00e0 l\u2019effet que les parents adoptifs n\u2019entrent pas dans la cat\u00e9gorie des personnes auxquelles l\u2019art. 1056 du Code civil accorde une action en indemnit\u00e9. En Cour d\u2019appel, on jugea que le fils du demandeur, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 le seul responsable de cet accident, et la Cour ne se pronon\u00e7a pas sur le quantum des dommages et sur la port\u00e9e de l\u2019art. 1056. Le demandeur en appela devant cette Cour.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel doit \u00eatre maintenu, le Juge en Chef Taschereau \u00e9tant dissident.\nLes Juges Fauteux, Abbott, Ritchie et Spence: C\u2019est \u00e0 bon droit que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a conclu \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 du chauffeur du camion. Ce dernier a viol\u00e9 le Code de la Route; il a cr\u00e9\u00e9 une situation propre \u00e0 jeter la confusion dans l\u2019esprit des personnes venant en sens oppos\u00e9, et en regard de toutes les circonstances r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9es par la preuve, il a cr\u00e9\u00e9 le danger que les dispositions du Code de la Route avaient pour objet de conjurer.\nIl n\u2019y a aucune raison justifiant cette Cour d\u2019intervenir pour modifier sur le quantum des dommages le jugement de la Cour de premi\u00e8re instance.\nIl ressort des dispositions de la Loi de l\u2019adoption, S.R.Q. 1925, c. 196, que par une fiction de droit on a cr\u00e9\u00e9 une filiation l\u00e9gitime entre les personnes de l\u2019adopt\u00e9 et des adoptants. Le l\u00e9gislateur a \u00e9lev\u00e9 et situ\u00e9 la famille adoptive au plan juridique de la famille l\u00e9gitime et a m\u00eame voulu couvrir les traits de la famille adoptive en lui donnant la physionomie de la famille l\u00e9gitime. Vu la r\u00e8gle de l\u2019art. 21 de la Loi de l\u2019adoption prescrivant, sauf exception, que dans toute autre loi le mot \u00abenfant\u00bb ou tout autre mot du m\u00eame sens\u2014par exemple le mot \u00abdescendant\u00bb dans l\u2019art. 1056 du Code\u2014comprend aussi un enfant adopt\u00e9, et vu aussi les dispositions de l\u2019art. 1056 o\u00f9 les dommages dont il est question r\u00e9sultent en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral presque exclusivement de la perte de cette cr\u00e9ance r\u00e9ciproque qu\u2019est la cr\u00e9ance alimentaire, il n\u2019est plus permis de justifier l\u2019exclusion de la famille adoptive du cadre de l\u2019art. 1056 du Code. On ne peut donc plus affirmer que les mots \u00abascendant\u00bb et \u00abdescendant\u00bb n\u2019ont jamais, dans l\u2019art. 1056, d\u2019autre sens que le sens g\u00e9n\u00e9alogique impliquant consanguinit\u00e9 et que ces mots ne r\u00e9f\u00e8rent toujours qu\u2019\u00e0 la famille l\u00e9gitime. Il s\u2019ensuit que les parents adoptifs, tout comme l\u2019enfant adopt\u00e9, b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient du droit d\u2019action conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par l\u2019art. 1056 du Code civil.\nLe Juge en Chef Taschereau, dissident: La Cour d\u2019appel a bien jug\u00e9 lorsqu\u2019elle est arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 la conclusion que le conducteur du camion n\u2019avait commis aucune faute engageant sa responsabilit\u00e9 ou celle de son patron. L\u2019art. 1056 du Code civil accorde un recours au p\u00e8re adoptif contre l\u2019auteur du d\u00e9c\u00e8s de son fils adoptif.\nMotor vehicle\u2014Fatal accident\u2014Collision between motorcycle and truck\u2014Liability\u2014Adopted child killed\u2014Whether adopting parents can bring action under art. 1056 of the Civil Code\u2014Highway Code, 8-9 Eliz. II (Que.), c. 67, s. 36(13), (18)\u2014Adoption Act, R.S.Q. 1925, c. 196.\nThe plaintiff\u2019s adopted son was killed when the motorcycle which he was driving in an easterly direction collided with a truck belonging to the defendant Lamontagne and driven in an opposite direction by his servant, the defendant Carri\u00e8re. The accident occurred as the driver of the truck was preparing to make a left-hand turn. A friend of the victim, who was riding on the back of the motorcycle, saw nothing of what happened; he estimates the speed of the motorcycle at 30 to 35 miles an hour and says that everything had been normal up to the time of the collision. The driver of the truck, who was alone, says that he approached the intersection at a speed of 8 to 10 miles an hour, that he drove his truck to the left side of the centre white line of the road, that he saw the on-coming motorcycle driven at a speed of 50 miles an hour and that he brought his vehicle to a stop on the left of the white line to allow the motorcycle to pass and waited a few seconds for the motorcycle to do so. He says further that the motorcycle, at about 50 feet from his truck, started to zigzag left and right of the white line and that, at about 10 feet from the truck, it skidded on its side until it finally struck the left front end of the truck. The trial judge held that the driver of the truck was solely to blame for the accident and dismissed the contention of the defendants to the effect that the adopting parents do not fall into the category of persons to whom art. 1056 of the Civil Code gives an action in indemnity. The Court of Appeal decided that the sole responsibility for the accident rested on the appellant\u2019s son and did not express an opinion as to the quantum of damages and as to the scope of art. 1056. The plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Taschereau C.J., dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.\nPer Fauteux, Abbott, Ritchie and Spence JJ.: The trial judge was right in his finding that the driver of the truck was solely to blame for the accident. The driver had violated the Highway Code; he created a situation liable to confuse the drivers coming from the opposite direction, and having regard to all the circumstances revealed by the evidence, he had created the very danger which the dispositions of the Highway Code were enacted to prevent.\nThere was no reason which could justify the intervention of this Court to modify the quantum of damages.\nIt appears from the provisions of the Adopting Act, R.S.Q. 1925, c. 196, that by a fiction of the law a legitimate filiation has been created between the person of the adopted and the person adopting. The legislator has elevated and placed the adopting family on a juridical level with the legitimate family and has even purported to cover the features of the adopting family by giving it the physiognomy of the legitimate family. Having regard to the rule contained in s. 21 of the Adopting Act providing, with certain exceptions, that in any other Act the word \u201cchild\u201d or any other words of the same meaning\u2014as for example the word \u201cdescendant\u201d in art. 1056 of the Code\u2014shall include also an adopted child, and having regard also to the provisions of art. 1056 where the damages in question are generally almost exclusively the result of the loss of that reciprocal debt which is the alimentary maintenance, it is impossible to justify the exclusion of the adopting family from art. 1056 of the Code. One cannot affirm any more that the words \u201cascendant\u201d and \u201cdescendant\u201d do not have, in art. 1056, any other meaning than the genealogical one implying consanguinity and that these words refer only to the legitimate family. It follows that the adopting parents, as well as the adopted child, have the benefit of the action given by art. 1056 of the Civil Code. Per Taschereau C.J., dissenting: The Court of Appeal has rightly found that the driver of the truck did not commit any fault involving his liability or, that of his master. Art. 1056 of the Civil Code gives to the adopting parents a right of action against the person causing the death of their adopted child.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec[1], reversing a judgment of Cot\u00e9 J.

Cet enfant a demeur\u00e9 avec le demandeur et son \u00e9pouse qui lui ont donn\u00e9 toute l\u2019affection, les soins et l\u2019\u00e9ducation voulus comme s\u2019il eut \u00e9t\u00e9 issu naturellement de leur mariage.\nCet enfant, Joseph Lucien Claude Latreille, est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 des suites d\u2019un accident d\u2019automobile survenu le 27 ao\u00fbt 1960, alors qu\u2019il \u00e9tait \u00e2g\u00e9 de dix-neuf ans. A cette date, vers les six heures p.m., cet enfant mineur du demandeur conduisait une motocyclette, la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de son p\u00e8re, sur la route N\u00b0 29 dans la municipalit\u00e9 d\u2019Oka, en direction de Montr\u00e9al. Le demandeur all\u00e8gue que son fils conduisait sa motocyclette \u00e0 sa droite de la route, mais que, lorsque arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intersection de ladite route avec la rue St-\u00c9douard, il entra en collision avec un camion, la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du d\u00e9fendeur Hubert Lamontagne, conduit par le co-d\u00e9fendeur, Jean-Paul Carri\u00e8re, employ\u00e9 et pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 du d\u00e9fendeur, qui \u00e9tait alors dans l\u2019exercice et l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de ses fonctions.\nLa Cour sup\u00e9rieure a maintenu l\u2019action du demandeur pour les dommages r\u00e9sultant de la mort de Claude Latreille et lui a accord\u00e9 la somme de $9,607. La Cour d\u2019Appel[2] a renvers\u00e9 ce jugement et en est arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 la conclusion que le conducteur du camion n\u2019avait commis aucune faute engageant sa responsabilit\u00e9 ou celle de son employeur, et a maintenu l\u2019appel et rejet\u00e9 l\u2019action.\nJe partage enti\u00e8rement l\u2019opinion et les vues exprim\u00e9es par M. le Juge en chef Tremblay et par MM. les Juges Rivard et Brossard. Comme eux, je crois qu\u2019aucune faute ne peut leur \u00eatre attribu\u00e9e.\nLe camion du d\u00e9fendeur circulait sur la route 29, entre Montr\u00e9al et Oka, sur la rive nord, dans une direction est-ouest, et le conducteur avait l\u2019intention de tourner \u00e0 gauche pour s\u2019engager dans la rue St-\u00c9douard, vers le sud. Au moment o\u00f9 il s\u2019appr\u00eatait \u00e0 faire ce virage, il aper\u00e7ut la motocyclette du jeune Latreille qui venait en sens inverse \u00e0 une vitesse d\u2019environ trente-cinq milles \u00e0 l\u2019heure. Le chauffeur du camion immobilisa alors son v\u00e9hicule \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s au centre du chemin, laissant de chaque c\u00f4t\u00e9 du camion l\u2019espace voulu pour permettre un passage libre o\u00f9 la motocyclette pouvait s\u2019engager en toute s\u00e9curit\u00e9.\nIl est clair, d\u2019apr\u00e8s la preuve, que le chauffeur du camion ne s\u2019est pas engag\u00e9 dans la rue St-\u00c9douard, et les t\u00e9moignages et l\u2019ensemble des circonstances r\u00e9v\u00e8lent qu\u2019il a tent\u00e9 d\u2019obliquer vers la droite afin de donner encore un espace plus large \u00e0 la motocyclette qui venait en sens inverse. C\u2019est ce qui explique que les dommages au camion ont \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9s sur le c\u00f4t\u00e9 gauche.\nLe seul t\u00e9moin qui a vu l\u2019accident est le conducteur du camion, Carri\u00e8re. C\u2019est lui qui nous raconte les faits que je viens de r\u00e9citer. Le jeune compagnon, qui accompagnait la victime sur le si\u00e8ge arri\u00e8re de la motocyclette, n\u2019a rien vu.\nLe juge au proc\u00e8s aurait exon\u00e9r\u00e9 Carri\u00e8re, mais il dit qu\u2019il ne le croit pas et la raison donn\u00e9e me para\u00eet d\u00e9pourvue de tout fondement juridique. Le juge refuse d\u2019accepter le t\u00e9moignage de Carri\u00e8re non pas \u00e0 cause de l\u2019attitude du t\u00e9moin, de sa fa\u00e7on de t\u00e9moigner, ni parce qu\u2019il y a contradiction dans son r\u00e9cit des faits. Il n\u2019y a rien dans son comportement qui d\u00e9montre de l\u2019hostilit\u00e9, mais la seule et unique raison invoqu\u00e9e par le juge au proc\u00e8s est qu\u2019il est invraisemblable qu\u2019un conducteur de camion attende cinq secondes \u00e0 l\u2019intersection d\u2019une route pour laisser libre passage \u00e0 un v\u00e9hicule venant en sens inverse. Le savant juge croit, en r\u00e9sum\u00e9, que les habitudes des chauffeurs modernes sont d\u2019\u00eatre imprudentes et que l\u2019on ne peut pas croire un t\u00e9moin qui affirme avoir fait preuve de prudence. Je ne puis accepter cette pr\u00e9tention nouvelle et \u00e9tonnante qui me para\u00eet totalement d\u00e9raisonnable.\nJ\u2019accepte de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence les conclusions de la Cour d\u2019Appel qui a fait une analyse minutieuse de la preuve et qui est arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 la conclusion que le d\u00e9fendeur Carri\u00e8re n\u2019avait commis aucune faute engageant sa responsabilit\u00e9 ou celle de son patron.\nBien que l\u2019opinion que j\u2019exprime sur la question de responsabilit\u00e9 me dispenserait de me prononcer sur la question de savoir si l\u2019art. 1056 du Code Civil accorde un recours au p\u00e8re adoptif contre l\u2019auteur du d\u00e9c\u00e8s de son fils, il me para\u00eet appropri\u00e9, cependant, de dire que sur cette question, je partage l\u2019opinion de M. le Juge Fauteux.\nL\u2019appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nLe jugement des Juges Fauteux, Abbott, Ritchie et Spence fut rendu par\nLE JUGE FAUTEUX:\u2014L\u2019appelant, tant personnellement qu\u2019en sa qualit\u00e9 de chef de la communaut\u00e9 de biens existant entre lui et son \u00e9pouse, a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 des intim\u00e9s les dommages r\u00e9sultant du d\u00e9c\u00e8s de Claude Latreille, leur fils adoptif. Ce dernier trouva la mort, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 19 ans, le 27 ao\u00fbt 1960, au cours et par suite d\u2019une collision entre la motocyclette qu\u2019il conduisait de l\u2019ouest \u00e0 l\u2019est sur la route 29, dans la r\u00e9gion d\u2019Oka, et le camion d\u2019Hubert Lamontagne conduit dans une direction oppos\u00e9e par son pr\u00e9pos\u00e9, Jean-Paul Carri\u00e8re, agissant alors dans l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des fonctions auxquelles il \u00e9tait employ\u00e9. Survenue \u00e0 l\u2019occasion d\u2019un virage \u00e0 gauche, que Carri\u00e8re entendait faire pour quitter la route 29 et s\u2019engager dans la rue St-\u00c9douard, cette collision r\u00e9sulte directement, suivant le demandeur, des fautes commises par Carri\u00e8re en la circonstance. En d\u00e9fense, les intim\u00e9s ont plaid\u00e9 que cet accident \u00e9tait exclusivement imputable au jeune Latreille, que le montant des dommages r\u00e9clam\u00e9s \u00e9tait exag\u00e9r\u00e9, qu\u2019en droit les parents adoptifs n\u2019entrent pas dans la cat\u00e9gorie des personnes auxquelles l\u2019art. 1056 du Code Civil accorde une action en indemnit\u00e9 et que partant il n\u2019y a aucun lien de droit entre eux-m\u00eames et l\u2019appelant.\nLa Cour sup\u00e9rieure rejeta la pr\u00e9tention voulant que les parents adoptifs n\u2019aient pas le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice du droit d\u2019action conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par l\u2019art. 1056 C.C., jugea que l\u2019accident \u00e9tait imputable \u00e0 Carri\u00e8re et, r\u00e9duisant le montant des dommages r\u00e9clam\u00e9s, condamna les intim\u00e9s \u00e0 payer \u00e0 l\u2019appelant la somme de $9,607 avec int\u00e9r\u00eats depuis la date de l\u2019assignation (juin 1961) et les d\u00e9pens.\nEn Cour d\u2019Appel[3], on jugea que le jeune Latreille, et non Carri\u00e8re, \u00e9tait responsable de cet accident et pour cette raison, on n\u2019eut pas \u00e0 se prononcer sur le quantum des dommages et sur la port\u00e9e de l\u2019art. 1056 C.C. L\u2019appel de Lamontagne et Carri\u00e8re fut accueilli et l\u2019action de Latreille rejet\u00e9e avec d\u00e9pens. D\u2019o\u00f9 le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi.\nSur la responsabilit\u00e9:\u2014Des trois voyageurs, impliqu\u00e9s dans cet accident, deux ont surv\u00e9cu: le jeune Ren\u00e9 Provin, compagnon de Latreille, et Carri\u00e8re qui \u00e9tait seul dans le camion. Assis \u00e0 l\u2019arri\u00e8re de Latreille sur la motocyclette, Provin, plus petit que Latreille, n\u2019a rien vu de ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019avant; il \u00e9value cependant de trente \u00e0 trente-cinq milles \u00e0 l\u2019heure la vitesse de la motocyclette et d\u00e9clare n\u2019avoir rien constat\u00e9 d\u2019anormal jusqu\u2019au moment de la collision. Quant \u00e0 la version de Carri\u00e8re, il convient, avant d\u2019en faire le r\u00e9cit, de d\u00e9crire les lieux de l\u2019accident et noter certains faits mat\u00e9riels que la preuve \u00e9tablit. Au moment de l\u2019accident, le temps \u00e9tait clair, le pav\u00e9 \u00e9tait sec et nul v\u00e9hicule, autres que la motocyclette et le camion, \u00e9tait engag\u00e9 sur les lieux. La rue St-\u00c9douard est une rue secondaire d\u2019une largeur d\u2019environ dix-sept pieds, allant du nord au sud, aboutissant et finissant au c\u00f4t\u00e9 sud de la route 29. La route 29 est une route provinciale, ayant une largeur de trente pieds pav\u00e9e d\u2019asphalte et dont le centre est indiqu\u00e9 par une ligne blanche. Au point de jonction avec la rue St-\u00c9douard, cette route accuse une \u00e9l\u00e9vation progressant en ligne droite de l\u2019est \u00e0 l\u2019ouest, sur une distance de six cents pieds. Au temps de l\u2019accident, il y avait, dans le pav\u00e9 d\u2019asphalte de la route, du c\u00f4t\u00e9 sud\u2011ouest de la jonction et pr\u00e8s de l\u2019accotement, une d\u00e9pression d\u2019une profondeur de six pouces et d\u2019un diam\u00e8tre de cinq pieds et demi, r\u00e9duisant ainsi \u00e0 quelque dix pieds la largeur de l\u2019espace libre permettant \u00e0 la motocyclette de passer sans danger \u00e0 droite de la ligne blanche. Avant et \u00e0 l\u2019instant m\u00eame de la collision, le camion se trouvait compl\u00e8tement \u00e0 gauche de la ligne blanche; et \u00e0 l\u2019instant m\u00eame de la collision, l\u2019avant en \u00e9tait presque en ligne avec le c\u00f4t\u00e9 est de la rue St-\u00c9douard. Ainsi conduit, ce camion, d\u2019une largeur de six pieds et demi, diminuait encore et d\u2019autant la largeur de l\u2019espace libre permettant le passage de la motocyclette, \u00e0 droite de la ligne blanche, largeur qui est ainsi finalement devenue r\u00e9duite \u00e0 quelque quatre ou cinq pieds. Apr\u00e8s l\u2019accident, on a constat\u00e9 une trace de freins, laiss\u00e9e par la motocyclette. Longue de dix-sept pieds, cette marque de freins commence \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s en ligne avec le c\u00f4t\u00e9 ouest de la rue St-\u00c9douard, pour se continuer en ligne droite, parall\u00e8lement et \u00e0 six pieds \u00e0 la droite, soit au sud, de la ligne blanche, jusqu\u2019au point de contact avec l\u2019avant gauche du camion. Outre les dommages qu\u2019on a constat\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019avant gauche du camion et qui ont permis de situer \u00e0 cet endroit le point de contact des deux v\u00e9hicules, on a observ\u00e9, apr\u00e8s l\u2019accident, que les deux roues d\u2019avant du camion \u00e9taient tourn\u00e9es vers la droite, tout comme si, avant l\u2019instant de la collision, Carri\u00e8re avait tent\u00e9 une man\u0153uvre pour reprendre sa droite afin de lib\u00e9rer la lisi\u00e8re dans laquelle venait la motocyclette. Carri\u00e8re, lui-m\u00eame \u00e2g\u00e9 de 24 ans, donne la version suivante sur la fa\u00e7on dont l\u2019accident s\u2019est produit. Ce jour-l\u00e0, il \u00e9tait engag\u00e9 \u00e0 faire de l\u2019annonce commerciale au moyen des huit haut-parleurs plac\u00e9s sur le toit du camion et permettant une diffusion dans une distance de un demi-mille. Il raconte que s\u2019\u00e9tant approch\u00e9 de l\u2019intersection \u00e0 une vitesse de huit \u00e0 dix milles \u00e0 l\u2019heure, il a quitt\u00e9 sa droite pour se placer \u00e0 gauche de la ligne blanche en vue du virage \u00e0 gauche qu\u2019il entendait faire pour s\u2019engager sur la rue St-\u00c9douard, qu\u2019il a vu venir la motocyclette au haut de la c\u00f4te, \u00e0 une vitesse de cinquante milles \u00e0 l\u2019heure, et que pour en assurer le passage, il a\u2014alors qu\u2019il \u00e9tait compl\u00e8tement \u00e0 gauche de la ligne blanche\u2014immobilis\u00e9 son camion, pour attendre pendant plusieurs secondes que la motocyclette ait pass\u00e9, les roues d\u2019avant \u00e9tant alors, d\u2019apr\u00e8s lui, tourn\u00e9es ou, suivant son expression, \u00abbarr\u00e9es pour virer vers la gauche\u00bb. Pendant qu\u2019il \u00e9tait ainsi \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat, dit-il, il surveillait la motocyclette qui, \u00e0 environ cinquante pieds du camion, commen\u00e7a \u00e0 louvoyer \u00e0 gauche et \u00e0 droite de la ligne blanche et \u00e0 environ dix pieds du camion, glissa sur le c\u00f4t\u00e9 pour venir en frapper l\u2019avant gauche. Il appara\u00eet clairement des raisons donn\u00e9es au soutien de son jugement, que le Juge de premi\u00e8re instance n\u2019a pas ajout\u00e9 foi \u00e0 Carri\u00e8re. R\u00e9f\u00e9rant particuli\u00e8rement \u00e0 l\u2019affirmation qu\u2019il aurait immobilis\u00e9 son camion pour attendre pendant plusieurs secondes le passage de la motocyclette, le Juge d\u00e9clare trouver invraisemblable que Carri\u00e8re ait pouss\u00e9 l\u2019esprit civique \u00e0 un point ne correspondant pas \u00abaux habitudes de la circulation moderne o\u00f9 l\u2019on tente \u00e0 tout br\u00fbler, feux de circulation, droits de passage, etc.\u00bb. Ce commentaire du Juge, dit le procureur des intim\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019instar de la Cour d\u2019appel, ne peut, en soi, justifier juridiquement l\u2019opinion que le Juge s\u2019est form\u00e9e sur la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de Carri\u00e8re. A mon avis, l\u00e0 n\u2019est pas, cependant, l\u2019unique raison de cette opinion. En fait, le Juge au proc\u00e8s qui a observ\u00e9, vu et entendu t\u00e9moigner Carri\u00e8re, n\u2019a certes pas \u00e9t\u00e9 sans \u00eatre impressionn\u00e9 de l\u2019insistance qu\u2019on a d\u00fb mettre en contre-interrogatoire, au cours duquel le Juge lui-m\u00eame dut intervenir, pour faire admettre \u00e0 Carri\u00e8re qu\u2019au moment du choc, son camion n\u2019\u00e9tait pas au centre de la route, comme il l\u2019avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans l\u2019interrogatoire principal, mais compl\u00e8tement \u00e0 gauche de la ligne blanche. Je crois qu\u2019il y a lieu d\u2019appliquer ici la r\u00e8gle bien connue que Lord Halstoury dans Montgomerie & Co. v. Wallace-James[4] formule comme suit \u00e0 la page 75:\nWhere a question of fact has been decided by a tribunal which has seen and heard the witnesses, the greatest weight ought to be attached to the finding of such a tribunal. It has had the opportunity of observing the \u2022demeanour of the witnesses and judging of their veracity and accuracy in a way that no appellate tribunal can have.\nEn toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence pour ceux qui ont l\u2019opinion contraire, je dirais, comme en a conclu le Juge de premi\u00e8re instance, \u00abapr\u00e8s avoir minutieusement consid\u00e9r\u00e9 tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis\u00bb que, contrairement \u00e0 ce qu\u2019a dit Carri\u00e8re, \u00able camion \u00e9tait encore en mouvement ou tout au moins venait-il de s\u2019arr\u00eater au moment du choc\u00bb. En droit, l\u2019intim\u00e9 qui voulait tourner \u00e0 gauche, devait, suivant le Code de la route, 8-9 Eliz. II, c. 67, art. 36, para. 18, s\u2019approcher de la ligne m\u00e9diane de la route 29, continuer en ligne droite jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la ligne m\u00e9diane de la rue St-\u00c9douard et effectuer le virage \u00e0 gauche d\u00e8s que la voie \u00e9tait libre. Il devait aussi, suivant le para. 13 du m\u00eame article, c\u00e9der le passage \u00e0 tout v\u00e9hicule venant en direction inverse et entrant dans l\u2019intersection ou qui en \u00e9tait si pr\u00e8s qu\u2019il pouvait y avoir danger de tourner devant ce v\u00e9hicule. Ce qui est certain, c\u2019est qu\u2019en quittant sa droite pour conduire \u00e0 gauche de la ligne blanche, avant d\u2019arriver au c\u00f4t\u00e9 est de l\u2019intersection, puis, \u00e9tant arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 ce point, en tentant de reprendre sa droite, comme semble fortement l\u2019indiquer la position des roues d\u2019avant du camion, ou en immobilisant, comme lui\u2011m\u00eame l\u2019a pr\u00e9tendu, son v\u00e9hicule compl\u00e8tement \u00e0 gauche de la ligne blanche, Carri\u00e8re a viol\u00e9 le Code de la route, il a cr\u00e9\u00e9 une situation propre \u00e0 jeter la confusion dans l\u2019esprit des personnes venant en sens oppos\u00e9, et au regard de toutes les circonstances r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9es par la preuve, il a cr\u00e9\u00e9 le danger que ces dispositions du Code de la route avaient pour objet de conjurer et dont l\u2019inobservance, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, eut l\u2019accident pour cons\u00e9quence. Aussi bien, soit dit avec respect pour ceux qui entretiennent l\u2019opinion contraire, est-ce \u00e0 bon droit que le Juge de premi\u00e8re instance a conclu \u00e0 sa responsabilit\u00e9 et partant \u00e0 celle de son patron, Lamontagne.\nSur le quantum des dommages:\u2014Le factum des intim\u00e9s n\u2019indique aucune raison justifiant cette Cour d\u2019intervenir pour modifier sur ce point le jugement de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure. D\u2019ailleurs, \u00e0 l\u2019audition, le procureur des intim\u00e9s n\u2019a pas insist\u00e9 sur la question.\nL\u2019article 1056 C.C. et la Loi de l\u2019adoption:\u2014L\u2019on sait que l\u2019art. 1056 tire son origine des Statuts Refondus du Canada de 1859, c. 78, qui reproduisent la Loi 10-11 Vict. (1847), c. 6, applicable au Bas-Canada comme au Haut-Canada et qui, sauf en ce qui a trait aux dispositions relatives au duel, est model\u00e9e, en substance sinon en expression, sur le statut imp\u00e9rial The Fatal Accidents Act, 9-10 Vict., c. 93, commun\u00e9ment connu sous le nom de Lord Campbell\u2019s Act. L\u2019on sait aussi que cet article a \u00e9t\u00e9 introduit au Code, sans avoir pass\u00e9 par les rapports des codificateurs et sans avoir figur\u00e9 parmi les amendements que la L\u00e9gislature du Bas- Canada a apport\u00e9s au projet de code, par la Loi 29 Vict. (1866), c. 41, mais qu\u2019il appara\u00eet \u00e0 cette \u00e9dition du Code Civil du Bas-Canada qui, sous l\u2019Union, fut imprim\u00e9e par l\u2019Imprimeur de la Reine de la province du Canada et qui a subs\u00e9quemment re\u00e7u de la L\u00e9gislature de la province de Qu\u00e9bec une reconnaissance officielle par la Loi 31 Vict. (1868), c. 7, o\u00f9 il est formellement d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9 que cette \u00e9dition a force de loi.\nLe premier alin\u00e9a de l\u2019art. 1056 est le seul qui nous int\u00e9resse en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Tel qu\u2019il se lit, depuis qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9 en 1930, par la Loi 20 Geo. V, c. 98, art. 1, afin de remplacer, dans la version fran\u00e7aise, les mots \u00abp\u00e8re, m\u00e8re et enfants\u00bb par les mots \u00abascendants et ses descendants\u00bb,\u2014assurant ainsi la concordance avec la version anglaise\u2014, ce premier alin\u00e9a prescrit que:\nArt. 1056. Dans tous les cas o\u00f9 la partie contre qui le d\u00e9lit ou quasi d\u00e9lit a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis d\u00e9c\u00e8de en cons\u00e9quence, sans avoir obtenu indemnit\u00e9 ou satisfaction, son conjoint, ses ascendants et ses descendants ont, pendant l\u2019ann\u00e9e seulement \u00e0 compter du d\u00e9c\u00e8s, droit de poursuivre celui qui en est l\u2019auteur ou ses repr\u00e9sentants, pour les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats r\u00e9sultant de tel d\u00e9c\u00e8s.\nL\u2019appelant ne pr\u00e9tend pas, et, me semble-t-il, il serait maintenant difficile de pr\u00e9tendre, que ce texte permet, per se et sans plus, d\u2019inclure comme b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de la disposition, la famille adoptive, i.e., l\u2019enfant adopt\u00e9 et les parents adoptifs. En effet, dans la cause de Town of Montreal West v. Hough[5], cette Cour ayant \u00e0 se prononcer sur la validit\u00e9 de Taction, prise en cette affaire avant l\u2019amendement de 1930, par le p\u00e8re et la m\u00e8re d\u2019un enfant naturel, d\u00e9clara que le droit d\u2019action conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par cet article \u00e9tait restreint \u00e0 la famille l\u00e9gitime. Dans ses raisons de jugement, le juge Rinfret, tel qu\u2019il \u00e9tait alors, d\u00e9clare que les mots \u00abp\u00e8re\u00bb, \u00abm\u00e8re\u00bb et \u00abenfants\u00bb, dans l\u2019art. 1056, ne pouvaient avoir pris, dans la pens\u00e9e du L\u00e9gislateur du Qu\u00e9bec, un sens diff\u00e9rent de celui qu\u2019ils ont dans les autres articles du Code et que, lorsque ces mots y sont employ\u00e9s sans qualificatif,\u2014except\u00e9 si le texte impose une interpr\u00e9tation diff\u00e9rente,\u2014ils r\u00e9f\u00e8rent exclusivement \u00e0 la paternit\u00e9, \u00e0 la maternit\u00e9 et \u00e0 la filiation l\u00e9gitimes. Ce raisonnement vaut aussi pour l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des mots \u00abascendants\u00bb et \u00abdescendants\u00bb, qui ont remplac\u00e9 mais comprennent les mots \u00abp\u00e8re\u00bb et \u00abm\u00e8re\u00bb et le mot \u00abenfants\u00bb respectivement. Et c\u2019est ainsi que dans Windsor Hotel Limited v. Dame Stadnicka et al[6], o\u00f9 il s\u2019agissait de la r\u00e9clamation faite de la part d\u2019enfants naturels, le juge Adjutor Rivard, adoptant une m\u00eame interpr\u00e9tation, concluait que\n\u2026l\u2019amendement de 1930 n\u2019a rien chang\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019article 1056 quant au caract\u00e8re l\u00e9gitime de la parent\u00e9 des personnes ayant droit de r\u00e9clamer et que, par cons\u00e9quent, les enfants naturels ne sont pas compris dans l\u2019\u00e9num\u00e9ration de ceux \u00e0 qui l\u2019article 1056 donne une action.\nEn fait, l\u2019appelant a conc\u00e9d\u00e9, qu\u2019ant\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 1924, alors que l\u2019adoption n\u2019\u00e9tait pas reconnue par la loi du Qu\u00e9bec, la famille adoptive n\u2019\u00e9tait pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9e, par la jurisprudence, comme b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de l\u2019art. 1056, ainsi qu\u2019en avait jug\u00e9 la Cour sup\u00e9rieure dans Dionne v. La Compagnie des Chars Urbains[7], o\u00f9 il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une r\u00e9clamation faite par le p\u00e8re adoptif de facto et non de jure. Cette d\u00e9cision, ant\u00e9rieure \u00e0 1924, pas plus d\u2019ailleurs que celle de Town of Montreal West v. Hough, supra, o\u00f9, tel que d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9, il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une action intent\u00e9e post\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 1924, mais non par des parents adoptifs, ne peuvent nous assister, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, pour d\u00e9terminer cette question, qui, tel que d\u00e9clar\u00e9 par les procureurs des parties, n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9e en cour d\u2019appel ou en cette Cour, savoir: l\u2019un des effets l\u00e9gaux du jugement d\u2019adoption n\u2019est-il pas d\u2019inclure la famille adoptive dans la cat\u00e9gorie des b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires de l\u2019article 1056? Il faut donc se r\u00e9f\u00e9rer \u00e0 la Loi de l\u2019adoption, S.R.Q. 1925, c. 196.\nL\u2019objet de la Loi de l\u2019adoption, tel que le r\u00e9v\u00e8lent l\u2019esprit, le sens et la fin v\u00e9ritables de ses prescriptions, est ainsi g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement d\u00e9crit par Trudel, Trait\u00e9 de Droit civil du Qu\u00e9bec, vol. 2., p. 153:\nToutes les dispositions de notre loi d\u2019adoption visent \u00e0 r\u00e9aliser, dans la famille adoptive, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019atmosph\u00e8re de la famille r\u00e9elle, dans l\u2019espoir que la premi\u00e8re remplira exactement le m\u00eame r\u00f4le que la seconde. Cette haute vis\u00e9e sociale fournira la raison et l\u2019explication de principes qui seraient autrement excessifs. Dans les conditions et dans les effets de l\u2019adoption nous apercevrons toujours ce d\u00e9sir imp\u00e9rieux de la loi.\nParmi les dispositions relatives aux effets du jugement d\u2019adoption, il importe de signaler et citer celles des arts. 16 et 21. Ces articles \u00e9tablissent ce que d\u00e9sormais, dans l\u2019\u00e9conomie du droit civil qu\u2019ils modifient fondamentalement en ce qui concerne les droits et obligations de la personne, doit \u00eatre la position juridique de la famille adoptive. Art. 16. A compter du jugement accordant la demande d\u2019adoption:\n1. Les parents, le tuteur ou les personnes charg\u00e9es de la garde et des soins de l\u2019enfant perdent tous les droits qu\u2019ils poss\u00e8dent en vertu du droit civil et sont dispens\u00e9s de toutes les obligations l\u00e9gales auxquelles ils sont tenus relativement \u00e0 cet enfant;\n2. L\u2019adopt\u00e9 est consid\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 tous \u00e9gards, relativement \u00e0 cette garde, \u00e0 l\u2019ob\u00e9issance envers ses parents et aux obligations des enfants envers leurs p\u00e8re et m\u00e8re, comme l\u2019enfant propre de ses parents d\u2019adoption;\n3. Les parents d\u2019adoption sont tenus de nourrir, entretenir et \u00e9lever l\u2019enfant comme s\u2019il \u00e9tait le leur propre.\nArt. 21. Le mot \u00abenfant\u00bb, ou tout autre mot de m\u00eame sens dans une autre loi ou dans un acte, comprend aussi un enfant adopt\u00e9, \u00e0 moins que le contraire n\u2019apparaisse clairement, mais il ne comprend pas l\u2019adopt\u00e9 lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit de substitution dans laquelle les enfants propres de l\u2019adoptant sont les grev\u00e9s ou les appel\u00e9s.\nCommentant plus particuli\u00e8rement sur les effets du jugement d\u2019adoption, Trudel, supra, aux pages 162 et suivantes, note comment le l\u00e9gislateur donne ainsi \u00e0 l\u2019enfant une famille l\u00e9gale, assimilable \u00e0 la famille l\u00e9gitime; comment les parents naturels perdent tout droit civil et sont dispens\u00e9s de toute obligation l\u00e9gale par rapport \u00e0 l\u2019enfant adopt\u00e9 et que le d\u00e9placement de la puissance paternelle entra\u00eene les cons\u00e9quences suivantes:\nEntre les personnes de l\u2019adopt\u00e9 et des adoptants il existe une filiation l\u00e9gitime: une fiction de droit en fait une r\u00e9alit\u00e9 juridique. Entre eux serait (sic) dus et exigibles tous devoirs et droits de famille; aliments et successibilit\u00e9 r\u00e9ciproques, garde, entretien, \u00e9ducation, correction. Outre ces pr\u00e9cisions de l\u2019article 16, l\u2019article 21 d\u00e9clare que le mot enfant, dans les lois et les actes, comprend toujours l\u2019enfant adopt\u00e9. Sauf deux exceptions: une indication contraire; dans les substitutions, si le grev\u00e9 ou l\u2019appel\u00e9 est l\u2019enfant propre de l\u2019adoptant. La jurisprudence a trait\u00e9 comme l\u00e9gitime l\u2019enfant adopt\u00e9. Une m\u00e8re adoptive, sans \u00eatre tutrice, peut r\u00e9clamer en son nom des aliments pour les besoins de son enfant d\u2019adoption (Flamand v. Corriveau, 73 C.S., 185). On lui \u00e9tend une pr\u00e9rogative accord\u00e9e en pratique aux m\u00e8res l\u00e9gitimes et refus\u00e9e aux filles-m\u00e8res. Autre exemple: l\u2019adopt\u00e9 a, comme les autres enfants l\u00e9gitimes, contribu\u00e9 de son salaire \u00e0 la caisse familiale, au budget g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des d\u00e9penses communes; il n\u2019a pas d\u2019action en recouvrement contre l\u2019adoptant. Il agissait \u00e0 titre d\u2019enfant, de d\u00e9biteur alimentaire (Bouchard v. Perron, 74 C.S., 141).\nDans une \u00e9tude intitul\u00e9e The Quebec Adoption Act and Domicile et publi\u00e9e dans la Revue du Barreau, tome 16, 1956, page 5, Fauteur, Walter S. Johnson, Q.C., r\u00e9f\u00e9rant particuli\u00e8rement \u00e0 l\u2019art. 16, indique, \u00e0 la page 6, une m\u00eame ligne de pens\u00e9e:\nSection 16, taking the child upon its adoption out of the custody and care of its parents, depriving them of all rights they possessed, and freeing them of all obligations, places the child instantly in the family of the adopter \u201cas the adopting parents\u2019 own child.\u201d Here the Code begins to apply. As their own child, he owes them honor and respect (art. 242), is subject to their authority during minority (art. 243), cannot leave the home without parental consent (art. 244), and takes the domicile of his adoptive father (art. 83); and so on. That is one group of \u201ceffects of adoption\u201d.\nSignalons aussi que dans d\u2019autres articles de la loi, on donne au fait de l\u2019adoption un caract\u00e8re strictement confidentiel. C\u2019est ainsi que, pour conjurer tout danger d\u2019indiscr\u00e9tion, on a prescrit la forme du certificat de naissance que doit, sur demande, livrer le d\u00e9positaire des registres de l\u2019\u00e9tat civil (S.R.Q. 1941, c. 324, art. 26). Aux m\u00eames fins, on a formellement d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9 confidentiels les dossiers de la cour relatifs aux jugements d\u2019adoption, dont on a prohib\u00e9 la consultation \u00e0 moins d\u2019une permission sp\u00e9ciale de la cour, que celle-ci ne peut accorder que dans des circonstances sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9es ou toute autre estim\u00e9e suffisamment grave ou importante par le juge pour justifier \u00abdans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de l\u2019adopt\u00e9\u00bb la consultation du dossier et qu\u2019\u00e0 la condition que, dans tous les cas, celui qui demande cette permission, \u00e9tablisse, \u00e0 la satisfaction du juge, \u00abun int\u00e9r\u00eat compatible avec le plus grand bien de l\u2019adopt\u00e9\u00bb (8-9 Elizabeth II, c. 10, art. 6).\nDe ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, il ressort, ainsi qu\u2019on s\u2019en exprime dans Trudel, supra, que par une fiction de droit qui en fait une r\u00e9alit\u00e9 juridique, on a cr\u00e9\u00e9 une filiation l\u00e9gitime entre les personnes de l\u2019adopt\u00e9 et des adoptants. Entre adopt\u00e9 et adoptants, on a cr\u00e9\u00e9\u2014particuli\u00e8rement quant aux aliments\u2014des droits et obligations qui, dans la famille l\u00e9gitime, sont respectivement ceux de l\u2019enfant vis-\u00e0-vis son p\u00e8re et sa m\u00e8re et ceux de ces derniers vis-\u00e0-vis leur enfant. Ainsi, peut-on affirmer que le L\u00e9gislateur a \u00e9lev\u00e9 et situ\u00e9 la famille adoptive au plan juridique de la famille l\u00e9gitime et m\u00eame voulu, en prescrivant la forme du certificat de naissance et d\u00e9cr\u00e9tant le caract\u00e8re confidentiel du dossier de l\u2019adoption, couvrir les traits de la famille adoptive en lui donnant, et lui assurant par des mesures fortifi\u00e9es de sanctions p\u00e9nales, la physionomie de la famille l\u00e9gitime.\nCette conclusion, conjugu\u00e9e (i) avec la r\u00e8gle de l\u2019art. 21, supra, prescrivant, \u00ab\u00e0 moins que le contraire n\u2019apparaisse clairement\u00bb et sauf l\u2019exception relative aux substitutions, que dans toute autre loi le mot \u00abenfant\u00bb ou tout autre mot du m\u00eame sens,\u2014tel le mot \u00abdescendants\u00bb, dans l\u2019art. 1056, qui, comme ci-dessus indiqu\u00e9, remplace mais implique le mot \u00abenfant\u00bb,\u2014comprend aussi un enfant adopt\u00e9 et (ii) avec les dispositions de l\u2019art. 1056, o\u00f9 les dommages, pour le recouvrement desquels le droit d\u2019action est conf\u00e9r\u00e9 aux b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires de la disposition, r\u00e9sultent, en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, presque exclusivement de la perte de cette cr\u00e9ance r\u00e9ciproque qu\u2019est la cr\u00e9ance alimentaire, ne permet plus de justifier l\u2019exclusion de la famille adoptive du cadre de l\u2019art. 1056. L\u2019intim\u00e9 ne conteste gu\u00e8re que l\u2019enfant adopt\u00e9 ait le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des dispositions de l\u2019art. 1056; l\u2019art. 21 suffit pour faire obstacle \u00e0 la pr\u00e9tention contraire. Il soumet, cependant, que toute autre est la situation en ce qui concerne les parents adoptifs. Le mot \u00abascendants\u00bb, argumente-t-il, employ\u00e9 au sens g\u00e9n\u00e9alogique, implique un lien du sang et ne saurait con-s\u00e9quemment comprendre les parents adoptifs. A mon avis, ce raisonnement fait abstraction de la r\u00e8gle pos\u00e9e par l\u2019art. 21 et de cette fiction de droit qui cr\u00e9e une filiation l\u00e9gitime entre adopt\u00e9 et adoptants, ce qui, d\u00e8s lors, ne permet plus d\u2019affirmer que les mots \u00abascendants\u00bb et \u00abdescendants\u00bb n\u2019ont jamais, dans l\u2019art. 1056, d\u2019autre sens que le sens g\u00e9n\u00e9alogique impliquant consanguinit\u00e9 et que ces mots ne r\u00e9f\u00e8rent toujours qu\u2019\u00e0 la famille l\u00e9gitime.\nA l\u2019instar du juge de premi\u00e8re instance, je dirais donc que les parents adoptifs, tout comme l\u2019enfant adopt\u00e9, b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient du droit d\u2019action conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par l\u2019art. 1056 et que partant, la pr\u00e9tention des intim\u00e9s qu\u2019il y a absence de lien de droit entre les parties ne peut \u00eatre accueillie.\nPour toutes ces raisons, je maintiendrais l\u2019appel et infirmerais le jugement de la Cour du banc de la reine, avec d\u00e9pens, et r\u00e9tablirais le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance.\nAppel maintenu avec d\u00e9pens, LE JUGE EN CHEF TASCHEREAU \u00e9tant dissident.\nProcureurs du demandeur, appelant: Pinard, Pigeon, Par\u00e9, Cantin & Thomas, Montr\u00e9al.\nProcureurs des d\u00e9fendeurs, intim\u00e9s: Bumbray, Carroll, Cardinal & Dansereau, Montr\u00e9al.\n[1] [1965] B.R. 624.\n[2] [1965] B.R. 624.\n[3] [1965] B.R. 624.\n[4] [1904] A.C. 73.\n[5] [1931] S.C.R. 113.\n[6] (1938), 64 B.R. 298 \u00e0 303.\n[7] (1895), 7 C.S. 449."}
