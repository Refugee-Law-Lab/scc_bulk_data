Ltd Appellant;\nand\nThe Labour Relations Board Of British Columbia And International Woodworkers Of America Local No. 1-405 Respondents.\n1964: October 26, 27; 1965: January 26.\nPresent: Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nLabour\u2014Arbitration\u2014Appointment of arbitrator by Labour Relations Board\u2014Application for writ of certiorari to quash appointment\u2014Labour Relations Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 205, s. 22(3)(a) [enacted 1961 (B.C.), c.S1,s.17(b)].\nIn the matter of the dismissal of one G, the respondent union by a letter of February 21, 1962, advised the appellant company that it was going to proceed to arbitration in compliance with the provisions of a collective agreement and in a further letter of February 27th it notified the company as to the name and address of its nominee on the arbitration board. On February 28th, upon instructions of the appellant, its solicitors wrote to the union taking the position that the union's letter of February 21st did not comply with the provisions of the collective agreement in that it neither set out the question to be arbitrated nor gave the name and address of the union's nominee as arbitrator.\nOn May 28th, the respondent Labour Relations Board notified the appellant of its contention that it had been requested to appoint an arbitrator to be the appellant's member of an arbitration board and that it intended to consider the matter at a Board meeting on June 12th. Despite the appellant's objections that the grievance had been abandoned pursuant to the provisions of the collective agreement, the Board determined that the dispute between the company and the union was arbitrable and on June 21st again requested the company to nominate its arbitrator. When the company did not do so the Board, purporting to act under s. 22(3) of the Labour Relations Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 205, nominated an arbitrator. An application by the company for a writ of certiorari to quash the appointment was dismissed and, on appeal, the judgment of the trial judge was affirmed by a majority decision of the Court of Appeal. The company then appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.: Section 22(3) (a) of the Labour Relations Act gave the Board power to appoint an arbitrator if in its opinion the question was arbitrable. The appellant's argument that the Board had to come to a correct decision on this question before it could make the appointment and that the correctness of the decision was reviewable by way of certiorari was rejected. The Board's jurisdiction did not depend upon whether or not a Court might think its opinion to be erroneous. There was nothing \"collateral\" or \"preliminary\" or \"jurisdictional\" about this question; it was \"of the very essence\" of the inquiry. Further, there could be no ground here for judicial review based on an opinion of error in statutory interpretation or an exercise of power beyond that conferred by the statute.\nThe Board made the decision which it alone had the power to make. It was made within the assigned area of the exercise of the power. It was final and not reviewable.\nPer Hall and Spence JJ.: The determination of the Labour Relations Board that the question was arbitrable was at least a quasi-judicial decision and such determination was reviewable on certiorari. Jarvis v. Associated Medical Services Inc. (1962), 35 D.L.R. (2d) 375, affirmed [1964] S.C.R. 497, referred to.\nUpon such a review, however, the conclusion was reached that the decision of the Board was correct. The appellant's argument that the grievance had been abandoned failed. The union's letter of February 27th was dispatched within the time limited by the provisions of the collective agreement, and reading the union's previous letter of February 21st together with a letter of G, dated February 12, 1962, in which he had set out his grievance, there was no doubt that the question to be arbitrated was sufficiently set out in writing.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], dismissing an appeal from an order of Maclean J. dismissing an application for certiorari to quash an appointment of an arbitrator. Appeal dismissed.\nD. McK. Brown, Q.C., for the appellant.\nH. E. Hutcheon, for the respondent Union.\nA. W. Mercer, for the respondent Board. The judgment of Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014Throughout these proceedings the appellant company has pressed two objections to the appointment of an arbitrator by the Labour Relations Board. First, it says that a complaint in writing from an employee that his dismissal is wrongful is not a notification of any cause to be arbitrated under the collective bargaining agreement because something equivalent to a bill of particulars ought to have been delivered. This is more than the technicalities of common law pleading ever required at any time in a case of this kind. The objection is entirely without merit.\nThe second objection that the grievance had been abandoned is equally technical. There was evidence on which the Board could act that the third step in the grievance was not completed until February 13, 1962. Then followed the union's letter of February 21st that they were going to arbitration, and the registered letter of February 27th naming their arbitrator. The collective agreement provides that the notice may be given by registered mail. There was, therefore, evidence before the Board on which it could find, as it must have done, that the union had complied with the grievance procedure. The company's submission of the truism that by contract law an offer is effective only when it is communicated to the offerer does not establish reviewable error under the terms of this agreement.\nBy s. 22(3) (a) of the Labour Relations Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 205, as amended by 1961 (B.C.), c. 31, the Board has power to appoint an arbitrator \"if in its opinion the question is arbitrable\". The company's argument before this Court was based on the dissenting reasons delivered in the Court of Appeal that the Board must come to a correct decision on this question before it can make the appointment and that the correctness of the decision is reviewable by way* of certiorari.\nWith respect, the Board's jurisdiction does not depend upon whether or not a Court may think its opinion to be erroneous. There is nothing \"collateral\" or \"preliminary\" or \"jurisdictional\" about this question. To continue with the established vocabulary in this branch of the law, it is \"of the very essence\" of the inquiry. Further, there can be no ground here for judicial review based on an opinion of error in statutory interpretation or an exercise of power beyond that conferred by the statute.\nIt is undisputed that there was a complaint of wrongful dismissal and a demand for the appointment of an arbitrator. Power to appoint an arbitrator in these circumstances belongs to the Board \"if in its opinion the question is arbitrable\". The company's argument wishes to change this language to read \"if in the opinion of the Board, which will be supported by a Court asserting a power of review, the question is arbitrable\". I happen to think that the Board's decision in this case was correct but that opinion has nothing to do with my task. The Board made the decision which it alone had the power to make. It was made within the assigned area of the exercise of the power. It is final and not reviewable.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs in favour of International Woodworkers of America, Local No. 1-405. There should be no award of costs to or against the Labour Relations Board in this Court.\nThe judgment of Hall and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nSPENCE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[2] pronounced on March 11, 1964, dismissing an appeal from the order of Maclean J. made on February 19, 1963, whereby the application of the appellant Galloway Lumber Co. Ltd. for a writ of certiorari was dismissed.\nBy a collective agreement between the appellant and the International Woodworkers of America, Local No. 1-405, made in August 1960, it was provided, inter alia:\nARTICLE XV\u2014GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE\nSection 1:\nThe Company and the Union mutually agree that, when a grievance arises in the plant or camp coming under the terms of this Agreement, it shall be dealt with without stoppage of work, in the following manner:\nStep 1:\nThe individual employee, with or without a job steward, shall first take up the matter with the foreman in charge of the work within fourteen (14) calendar days.\nStep 2:\nIf a satisfactory settlement is not then reached, it shall be reduced to writing by both parties, when the same employee and the Committee shall take up the grievance with the superintendent or the personnel officer, or both, as designated by the Company. If desired, the Union business agent shall accompany the Committee. Step 3:\nIf the grievance is not then satisfactorily solved, it shall be referred to an authorized representative of the Union and the Management.\nStep 4:\nIf a satisfactory settlement is not then reached, it shall be dealt with by arbitration, hereinafter provided.\nSection 2:\nIf a grievance has not advanced to the next stage under Step 2, 3 or 4, within fourteen (14) days after completion of the preceding stage, then the grievance shall be deemed to be abandoned, and all rights of recourse to the grievance procedure shall be at an end. Where the Union is not able to observe this time limit by reason of the absence of the Aggrieved Employee or the Committee from camp the said time limit shall not apply. The Union shall be bound to proceed in such a case as quickly as may be reasonably possible.\nSection 3:\nGrievance meeting shall, except in cases of emergency, and whenever possible, be held out of working hours.\nARTICLE XVII\u2014ARBITRATION\nSection 2:\n(a) In the case of a dispute arising regarding the discharge of an employee or the failure to re-hire an employee under this Agreement, which the Parties are unable to settle between themselves as set out in Article XV, the matter shall be determined by arbitration in the following manner:\nEither Party may notify the other Party in writing, by registered mail, of the question or questions to be arbitrated, and the name and address of its chosen representative for the Arbitration Board. After receiving such notice and statement the other Party shall, within five (5) days, appoint an Arbitrator and give notice in writing of such appointment and the name and address of its Arbitrator. If the two Arbitrators appointed by the Parties fail to agree upon a Chairman within five (5) days, they, or either one of them, shall forthwith request the Labour Relations Board of British Columbia to appoint a Chairman.\n(b) The decision of the Arbitration Board shall be by majority vote and all decisions regarding discharge or failure to rehire employees which have been referred to arbitration will be final and binding upon the Parties of the First and Second Parts.\n(c) If any Arbitration Board finds that an Employee has been unjustly suspended or discharged such Employee shall be reinstated with all his rights and privileges preserved under the terms of this Agreement. The Arbitration Board shall further make the determination of the amount of lost pay, if any, to be paid to the Employee.\nSection 3:\nThe Parties of the First and Second Parts will each bear the expense and charges of its representatives on any Arbitration Board, and shall bear in equal proportions the expenses and allowances of the Chairman or Sole Arbitrator, as the case may be, and the stenographic and secretarial expense, and rent.\nSection 4:\nAny arbitration to be held hereunder shall be held at such place as may be decided by the Board. Such grievance procedure was instituted by one Gorrie by his letter of February 12, 1962. On that day, a meeting in compliance with step 3, supra, was convened but the representatives of the appellant refused to reinstate Gorrie at such meeting.\nOn the next day, the representative of the respondent union telephoned to the president of the appellant company and sought to have the latter reconsider his decision of the previous day but his effort was in vain.\nOn February 21st, the respondent union forwarded to the appellant company a registered letter which read:\nMr. Henry Nelson,\nManager,\nGalloway Lumber Company Ltd.,\nGalloway, B.C.\nDear Sir:\nIn the matter of the discharge of Mr. Earl Gorrie, please be advised that Local 1-405 International Woodworkers of America, AFL-CIO-CLC are going to proceed to Arbitration, in compliance with ARTICLE XV STEP 4 and as provided for under ARTICLE XVII Section 2(a) of the 1960-1962 Master Agreement.\nYou will be notified shortly the name and address of the Union's chosen representative for the Arbitration Board.\nYours truly,\n\"Art Damstrom\"\nArt E. Damstrom,\nPresident,\nInternational Woodworkers\nof America,\nLocal 1-405.\nand on February 27th forwarded a further letter which read:\nMr. Henry Nelson,\nManager,\nGalloway Lumber Co. Ltd.,\nGalloway, B.C.\nDear Sir:\nFurther to my letter of February 21st, 1962, please be advised that Mr. John A. McNiven, 517 East Broadway, Vancouver, B.C., has been chosen as a Union nominee on the Arbitration Board in the matter of the discharge of Mr. Earl Gorrie.\nYours truly,\nLOCAL 1-405, I.W.A.,\n\"Art Damstrom\"\nA. Damstrom,\nPresident. This letter was received by the appellant company on February 28th. On the same day, upon the instructions of the appellant company, its solicitors wrote to the union taking the position that the union's letter of February 21st supra, did not comply with the provisions of art. XVII of the collective agreement in that it neither set out the question to be arbitrated nor gave the name and address of the union's nominee as arbitrator.\nOn May 28th, the respondent Labour Relations Board notified the appellant company of its contention that it had been requested to appoint an arbitrator to be its member of the arbitration board and that it intended to consider the matter at the Board meeting on June 12th. Despite the appellant company's objections that the grievance had been abandoned pursuant to art. XV of the collective agreement the Labour Relations Board determined that the dispute between the appellant company and the respondent union was arbitrable and on June 21st again requested the company to nominate its arbitrator. When the company did not do so the Labour Relations Board by its Notice of Appointment dated July 17, 1962, purporting to act under s. 22(3) of the Labour Relations Act, nominated George Haddad to act as a member of the arbitration board. This application for certiorari followed.\nSection 22(3) of the Labour Relations Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 205, as amended by 1961 (B.C.), c. 31, provides:\n22. (3) Where the provision required or prescribed under this section provides for the appointment of a board of arbitration or other body,\n(a) if either party to the collective agreement within five days of the written notice from the other party of the appointment of his member or members fails or neglects to appoint a member or members, the Labour Relations Board may, if in its opinion the question is arbitrable, appoint a person or persons it deems fit for such purpose, and such person or persons is or are deemed to be appointed by the said party; and\n(b) if the appointed members, within five days from the date of the appointment of the last appointed member, fail to agree upon a person to act as Chairman, and any one of the members has been appointed under clause (a), the Minister may appoint a Chairman.\nThe respondent Labour Relations Board submits that the finding by that Board that the question was arbitrable and the consequent appointment of an arbitrator when the company failed to do so were merely exercises of administrative power and neither judicial nor quasi-judicial acts so that no certiorari lay therefrom. This submission seems to be the one which found favour before the Court of Appeal of British Columbia. Davey J.A., giving the majority judgment in that Court, said:\nThe appointment of the arbitrator is not a matter of jurisdiction, but the exercise of a mere power. The appointment of the arbitrator only completes the membership of the arbitration board and enables it to function if it truly has jurisdiction. The appointment of the arbitrator is in effect no different from the appointment of a chairman of the Labour Relations Board under s. 22(3) (b) of the Act. The consequences end with the appointment; it does not clothe the arbitration board with jurisdiction to decide the question, if in law it has none. All counsel agree that the question of the jurisdiction of the arbitration board remains for the proper tribunal to determine, untrammelled by the Labour Relations Board's opinion; that is to say, in this case by the ordinary courts of law. That is my conclusion and the opinion expressed by Professor Carrothers in his work on \"Labour Arbitration in Canada\", p. 27.\nSince the opinion of the Labour Relations Board that the question is arbitrable binds no one, and decides nothing, but merely leads in the discretion of the Labour Relations Board to the appointment of an arbitrator so that the arbitration board may function if the question is truly arbitrable, it is not a judicial or quasi judicial act that can be reviewed by certiorari.\nWith respect, I am unable to agree. It may well be that the appointment itself is a purely administrative act. But before the Labour Relations Board may make the appointment it must determine \"if in its opinion the question is arbitrable\". This entails a consideration and interpretation of the collective agreement. If the grievance has not advanced to the next stage within 14 days after completion of the preceding stage the grievance was \"deemed to be abandoned\" by the terms of art. XV, s. 2, of the collective agreement. If the grievance were abandoned, then there could be no question to be arbitrated. The determination therefore was a judicial question not merely an administrative one.\nMoreover, the opinion of the Labour Relations Board that the question was arbitrable cannot be described as one which \"binds no one and decides nothing\". Section 2 of art. XVII of the collective agreement would become operative upon the Labour Relations Board's appointment, an arbitration would proceed, the decision in the words of s. 2(b) of the article would be final, and the parties to the arbitration by the provisions of s. 3 of the article would have to bear the cost equally. Even if it were open to the arbitration board to hold after a hearing that the question were not arbitrable, upon which I express no opinion, the determination by the Labour Relations Board that it were would have required the appellant company to engage in the arbitration proceedings and incur the necessary costs thereof.\nBeing of the opinion that the determination of the Labour Relations Board that the question was arbitrable was at least a quasi-judicial decision, I am strongly of the opinion that such determination may be reviewed in the Courts. I adopt the language of Aylesworth J.A. in giving the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in Jarvis v. Associated Medical Services Inc. et al[3]. at p. 379:\n\u2026it is trite to observe that the Board cannot by an erroneous interpretation of any section or sections of the Act confer upon itself a jurisdiction which it otherwise would not have.\nThat judgment was affirmed in this Court[4], and both Cartwright J. at p. 502 and I in my reasons at p. 520, although dissenting on another issue, expressed strongly the view that a judicial or quasi-judicial decision of an administrative board delimiting its field of jurisdiction was reviewable on certiorari.\nUpon such a review, however, I have come to the conclusion that the decision of the Labour Relations Board was correct. Article XV of the collective agreement in s. 2 provided that if the grievance had not advanced to the next stage within 14 days after completion of the preceding stage it should be deemed to have been abandoned.\nStep 3 of the said s. 1 of art. XV read as follows:\nIf the grievance is not then satisfactorily solved, it shall be referred to an authorized representative of the Union and the Management.\nCounsel for the appellant has proceeded throughout upon the basis that step 3 was completed when Mr. Damstrom, the president of the local of the union, and Mr. H. Nelson, the manager of the appellant company, met and conferred on February 12, 1962. At the close of that meeting there was, however, no formal entry made setting out the result thereof and I cannot see why the telephone conversation between the same two men on the next day, February 13, 1962, cannot be considered a continuation of step 3 so that step 3 did not terminate until the latter date. On the 14th day thereafter, i.e., the 27th of February, and within the time limited by s. 2 of art. XV, Mr. Damstrom dispatched to Mr. Nelson the letter which I have recited above. In that letter Mr. Damstrom gives the name and address of the union's nominee to the arbitration board. In my view, this disposes of one of the two bases of the appellant company's argument that the grievance had been abandoned. The second objection was that the registered letter dated February 21, 1962, which I have quoted above, did not contain the statement of the questions to be arbitrated. That letter read in part: \"In the matter of the discharge of Earl Gorrie \u2026\" Gorrie's first letter of February 12th had set out his grievance in writing as follows:\n\"That I was fired from my job without proper cause.\"\nReading those two documents together, I have no doubt that the question to be arbitrated was sufficiently set out in writing. I am of the opinion that in the matter of labour relations and arbitration thereon to take a narrow, technical and pedantic view of the procedure is to defeat the purpose for which the statute was enacted.\nFor these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal with costs in favour of International Woodworkers of America, Local No. 1-405. There should be no award of costs to or against the Labour Relations Board in this Court.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Russel & DuMoulin, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the respondent, Labour Relations Board of British Columbia: Paine, Edmonds, Mercer & Williams, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the respondent, International Woodworkers of America, Local No. 1-405: Shakespeare & Hutcheon, Vancouver.\n[1] (1964), 48 W.W.R. 78, 44 D.L.R.

Chartered Trust Co., [1965] S.C.R. 251\nDate: 1965-02-01\nJuris Benjamins (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nChartered Trust Company, Administrator with the Will annexed of the Estate of Antons Benjamins (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1964: October 8, 9; 1965: February 1.\nPresent: Cartwright, Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nWills\u2014Husband and wife domiciled in Latvia\u2014Joint will\u2014Bank accounts in Switzerland and England\u2014Whether separate property of wife and thus available for distribution amongst her heirs or whether joint property of herself and her husband so as to entitle his heirs to a one\u2011half interest therein.\nA B and his wife E B, who were separate as to property in accordance with a contract made at or before the time of their marriage, executed a joint will in 1937. By para. II of the will it was provided that, apart from certain specified property, all property should be the joint property of the spouses. Both testators were domiciled in Latvia where A B died in 1939 and from whence his wife was transported to Russia where she was presumed to have died in 1941. In 1926 E B had adopted her sister\u2019s son, the defendant in this case. A B, who had three children of a previous marriage, did not join in this adoption. In 1933 A B and E B deposited certain funds in a joint account in a bank in Zurich, Switzerland, and in 1939, some time before the death of her husband, E B alone opened an account in London, England. In 1948 the defendant obtained payment of the funds from the bank account in Zurich and in 1950, on probate of the will of E B, he obtained, as her executor, payment of the funds from the account in London.\nThe defendant came to Canada in 1952. On February 18,1960, the Surrogate Court of the County of York granted letters of administration with the will annexed of the estate of A B to the plaintiff trust company. In an action for an accounting and payment of moneys received by the defendant, the plaintiff claimed that one half of the proceeds of the bank accounts should have been paid to those entitled under the will of A B. The action was allowed and the Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal from the trial judgment, subject to a minor variation in the method of taking the accounts thereby directed. The defendant further appealed to this Court.\nThe appeal was argued on the assumption that under the law of Latvia an item of property which was owned jointly by the testator and testatrix would on the death of either of them belong one half to the survivor and one half to the estate of the deceased, and it was accepted by both the Courts below that the terms of a marriage contract providing that the husband and wife should be separate as to property could be validly revoked under Latvian law so as to make the property of each the joint property of both.\nHeld (Cartwright J. dissenting in part): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Spence JJ.: The moneys deposited in Zurich were placed in a joint account, and, notwithstanding the provisions of the \u201cContract Respecting a Joint Account Held Jointly and Severally\u201d entered into between the depositors and the bank, these moneys were to be treated as belonging to the testator and testatrix in equal shares.\nOn the death of A B his will became effective to control the disposition of a one-half interest in any property which was at that time jointly held by himself and his wife. In the Goods of Raine (1858), 1 Sw. & Tr. 144; Re Duddell, Roundway v. Roundway, [1932] 1 Ch. 582; Re Creelman, Mclntyre v. Gushue et al., [1956] 2 D.L.R. 494; Re Kerr, [1948] O.R. 543, referred to.\nThe question of whether the London bank account was so jointly held depended upon the construction to be placed on the second paragraph of the will. This paragraph was not only descriptive of the understanding existing between husband and wife at the time of preparing the will as to joint ownership of certain property therein referred to, but it also manifested the intention of both of them that on the death of each his or her will was to be treated as an effective disposition of one half of such property. The words \u201cas regards our estate\u2026\u201d which occurred at the beginning of the paragraph were to be construed as meaning \u201cas regards the estate hereinafter disposed of\u201d and the words \u201call other property except of course purely personal property such as clothes, jewellery, etc. is the joint property of both of us\u2026\u201d were sufficiently broad to include moneys on deposit in a bank in the names of either the testator or the testatrix or both of them.\nIn the absence of evidence of any Latvian law to the contrary the will was to be construed in accordance with the provisions of s. 26(1) of The Wills Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 433. The contention that the second paragraph of the will was concerned with the recital of facts rather than the disposition of property and that it should be construed without reference to the provisions of s. 26(1) of The Wills Act failed. The said paragraph was descriptive of the understanding of the husband and wife as to the nature of the interest of each of them in \u201cthe real and personal estate comprised in\u201d the dispositions which were the subject of the succeeding paragraphs, and unless a contrary intention could be found in the language of the will it was to be construed as though it had been executed immediately before the death of A B.\nLikewise, the contention that the second paragraph was to be treated as referable only to property owned at the date of the will because the provisions declaring the estate to be \u201cthe joint property of both of us\u201d were phrased in the present tense and that there were no words which expressly included the after-acquired property of either of the parties also failed. The employment of the present tense in conjunction with a general description of property did not of itself constitute evidence of a \u201ccontrary intention\u201d within the meaning of s. 26(1) of The Wills Act, and no language could be found in the will which limited the joint estate created by the second paragraph to personal property owned by the testator and testatrix at the date when the will was made.\nRe Ingram (1918), 42 O.L.R. 95, referred to.\nPer Cartwright J., dissenting in part: With regard to the moneys deposited with the bank in Zurich the conclusion arrived at in the Courts below was correct.\nAs to the ownership of the moneys in the bank account in London, E B had the sole legal title to this chose in action and the onus of proving that A B was entitled to any interest in it lay upon the plaintiff. The latter\u2019s claim was based upon the terms of para. II of the will. However, construed in the manner most favourable to the plaintiff which its words would bear para. II was an acknowledgement by each of the spouses that all property then standing in the names of either or both of them (with the exception of the property expressly excluded) was the joint property of both. No contract between the spouses as to the ownership of property acquired after the date of the will was established and there was no ground for holding that A B was entitled to any equitable interest in the London account. There was no room for the suggestion that the will of E B bequeathed any interest in this fund to A B.\nAt the date of the death of A B and at the date of the death of E B the latter was the person solely entitled both at law and in equity to the moneys in the London bank account.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Schatz J., subject to a minor variation in the method of taking accounts thereby directed.

(dissenting in part):\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1 dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Schatz J., subject to a minor variation in the method of taking the accounts thereby directed.\nThe questions raised on this appeal are as to the ownership of sums of money on deposit in two bank accounts, one of 743,000 Swiss francs which stood to the credit of Antons Benjamins and Emilija Benjamins in the Swiss Bank Corporation in Zurich, Switzerland, and the other of $110,000, U.S. funds, which stood to the credit of Emilija Benjamins in the Swiss Bank Corporation in London, England.\nBy the judgment in appeal it was declared that the respondent is entitled to one half of the amount in each of these bank accounts and the appellant was ordered to account accordingly.\nAntons Benjamins was born in 1861 in Latvia. He had three children of a first marriage, Marta, Anna and Janis. Janis died in Russia in 1942. Marta and Anna are living. Antons and his second wife, Emilija, were married in 1922. At that time both of them were domiciled in Latvia and they continued to be domiciled there until their deaths. At or before the time of their marriage public notice was given pursuant to the civil laws of Latvia that the parties had entered into a mutual marriage contract by which community of property was repealed. In consequence of this each spouse would be entitled to his or her separate property.\nAt the time of the marriage Antons Benjamins was an undischarged bankrupt and was employed by Emilija in a publishing business owned by her.\nIn 1926 Emilija Benjamins adopted the appellant who was the son of her sister and who was then eight years old. Antons Benjamins did not join in this adoption. Emilija Benjamins had no other children.\nThe business enterprises in which Antons and Emilija were engaged prospered and prior to the outbreak of war in 1939 they appear to have been possessed of considerable wealth.\nOn January 23, 1933, Antons and Emilija Benjamins executed a contract with the Swiss Bank Corporation in Zurich. This document is headed \u201cContract respecting a joint account held jointly and severally\u201d. It is signed by Antons Benjamins, Emilija Benjamins and the bank. The evidence is silent as to the source of the money deposited in this account. The contract provides inter alia that:\n2. Each of the aforementioned joint and several depositors and joint and several creditors is entitled to dispose, solely and without restriction, of the securities deposited and of the existing credit balances; the signature of one of the entitled parties is sufficient to give to the depository legally valid full and final discharge. In the event of the decease of one of the entitled parties, the disposal right of the deceased is extinguished: it does not, therefore, pass to his heirs or to his testamentary executors. The surviving entitled party\/parties is\/are exclusively empowered forthwith to dispose of the deposit and the accounts mentioned in the manner as afore-described and to give to the depository legally valid full and final discharge.\nOn May 5, 1937, Antons and Emilija signed a will contained in one notarial document. The document was executed in Riga, in the Latvian language. A translation into English accepted by the parties was marked as Exhibit 2 at the trial. The following statement is contained in this document:\nEmilija Benjamins acted without the assistance of her husband Antons Benjamins on the basis of the marriage contract regarding the separation of property, presented to me in the original, executed between the said married couple Benjamins at the office of A. Meike, Notary of Riga.\nIt will be necessary to refer to other provisions of this document hereafter.\nOn April 6, 1939, Emilija Benjamins deposited in the Swiss Bank Corporation in London, England, the sum of 110,000 United States dollars in her name alone.\nOn June 14, 1939, Antons Benjamins died. His will was not admitted to probate because of a contest between his surviving wife and the children of his first wife. In 1941 Emilija Benjamins was arrested during the occupation of Latvia by Russia and was deported to Russia. She is assumed to have died in a U.S.S.R. prison camp shortly thereafter.\nIn 1944 the appellant escaped from Latvia. He proceeded to England in 1947. In 1948 the appellant obtained payment of 743,000 Swiss francs out of the account in the Swiss Bank Corporation in Zurich, Switzerland. On January 16, 1950, probate of the will of Emilija Benjamins was granted to the appellant by the High Court of Justice (Probate Division) in England and as her executor he obtained payment of the sum of $110,000 in American funds from the account with the Swiss Bank Corporation in London, England. It has not been suggested that the Bank was not entitled to make payment of these amounts to the appellant.\nThe estate of Emilija has been administered by paying one third of the net proceeds of the two bank accounts to the appellant\u2019s mother and two thirds to himself in his personal capacity. The respondent claims that one half of the proceeds of the bank accounts should have been paid to those entitled under the will of Antons Benjamins.\nThe appellant came to Canada in 1952. On February 18, 1960, the Surrogate Court of the County of York granted letters of administration with the will annexed of the estate of Antons Benjamins to the respondent. On April 17, 1961, the respondent commenced this action.\nThe judgments below are based largely on the effect of the wills contained in one notarial document executed by Antons Benjamins and Emilija Benjamins on May 5, 1937.\nFollowing the opening recitals this document commences with the words:\nWe, the married couple Antons Benjamins and Emilija Benjamins, nee Simsons, hereby express our Last Will in the form of the following Testament. I, The life work of both of us is the publication of the daily newspaper \u201cJaunakas zinas\u201d and the weekly journal \u201cAtputa\u201d. Working jointly we have developed and equipped these publications so as to form large press establishments with many branch offices. It is our express wish that this our life\u2019s work shall be continued in the same manner and spirit as hitherto and also that it shall continue to be an undivided and united enterprise.\nThere follow elaborate provisions for the carrying on of this publishing enterprise during the life of the surviving spouse and thereafter, which do not appear to have any direct bearing on the questions raised on this appeal.\nThe next paragraph reads as follows:\nII. As regards our estate, we hereby verify that only the two villas which are situate at No. 15 Juras iela, Majori, in the town of Regas Jurmala, namely the original villa and the villa now added to it, bought from Elizabete Rozite, which form one unit for mortgage purposes, are the separate property of Emilija Benjamins nee Simsons. On the other hand, all other property, except of course purely personal property such as clothes, jewellery, etc. is the joint property of both of us, irrespective of whether this property is registered in the name of one or both of us, and irrespective of whether our various publishing undertakings, enterprises and subsidiary branches should have hitherto been managed, concessioned and registered in the name of one or both of us. This appears, inter alia, from the 4 agreements executed between us in 1922 before the Notary Meike, namely a) the agreement relating to the immovable property No. 29.L Kaleju iela, Riga, and the immovable property No. 12 Audeju iela, Riga; b) the agreement relating to the printing works and book-binding plant, situated at No. 29.L Kaleju iela, Riga; c) the agreement relating to the \u201cJaunakas zinas\u201d publishing undertaking and d) the agreement relating to the business premises at No. 12 Audeju iela, Riga, but we consider it expedient to state here the said facts in case the agreements should be lost, and to elucidate that the same applies to all our subsequent undertakings, that is to say, that each of us owns an undivided half of all the undertakings.\nParagraph III, which follows, reads:\nIII. I, Antons Benjamins, appoint as my heirs to my entire present and future estate immovable and movable, wheresoever the same be situated and of whatsoever it may consist; 1) My wife Emilija Benjamins nee Simsons, to whom upon my death pass a) the undivided half share belonging to me in the immovable property known as \u201cValdeki\u201d situated in the Kandava commune, together with the entire livestock and inventory, installations, equipments and all appurtenances, including the new farms acquired from various persons, parcelled off from the Aizdzire estate, which have not so far been registered in our\u2014Antons and Emilija Benjaminsnames, as well as my undivided half share in the furnishings and other movable property existing at \u201cValdeki\u201d, with the request that after my death, when Emilija Benjamins shall become the sole owner of \u201cValdeki\u201d the economic condition and form of \u201cValdeki\u201d shall be maintained as hitherto as a model agricultural farm; b) the undivided half share of the furnishings, works of art and household utensils in our joint flat at No. 12 Krisjana Barona iela, Riga, and generally all other movable property existing at the premises No. 12 Kr. Barona iela, Riga, and in additional all private motor cars; c) one undivided fourth share of the remaining property, movable and immovable, also including all our publishing undertaking, enterprises, etc. but subject to the reservation that this one undivided fourth share shall, upon the death of my wife Emilija Benjamins, nee Simsons, pass into the possession of the children of my own flesh namely in the first instance into the possession of my two daughters Anna Kuplais nee Benjamins, and Marta Cakste, nee Benjamins, but only if Anna Kuplais and Marta Cakste, or either of them separately, have by then resumed and maintained amicably polite relations with my wife Emilija Benjamins; in the opposite case, the said undivided one fourth share, or as the case may be, one undivided eighth share shall in their place devolve on my son Janis Benjamins.\nThere follow provisions for determining whether \u201camicably polite relations\u201d have been established and the paragraph continues:\n2) My son Janis Benjamins, to whom after my death passes a further two quarters share (See III, Section 1, clause c) of all my residuary estate after deduction of the bequests to Emilija Benjamins under III, Section 1, clauses a and b, and 3) my daughters Anna Kuplais, nee Benjamins, and Marta Cakste nee Benjamins, to whom passes after my death the last one quarter share (See III, Section 1, clause c and III, Section 2), namely to each fifty per cent of such one quarter share, that is, to each a one eighth share. Consequently on my death the children of my own flesh shall inherit a three quarter share in my entire estate after previous deduction of those objects which according to the aforesaid are bequeathed directly and unconditionally to my wife Emilija Benjamins, besides which in respect of this share I substitute the legal heirs of my children in accordance with the legal provisions regarding inheritance,\u2026 Paragraph IV opens with the words:\nIV. I, Emilija Benjamins, nee Simsons, appoint as my heirs in respect of my entire estate, both present and future, immovable and movable, wherever it may be situated and of whatever it my consist: 1) My adopted son Georgs, alias Juris Benjamins, to whom, upon my death passes: a) the immovable property known as \u201cValdeki\u201d\u2026\nThis clause continues in words similar to those in cl. III (1) (a) but has added at the end the sentence:\nAnd if I, Emilija Benjamins, should predecease my husband Antons Benjamins then this inheritance would be reduced to a half of what has been enumerated above.\nThe paragraph continues:\nb) The whole of the furnishings, works of art and household utensils of our joint flat at No. 12, Krisjana Barona iela, Riga, and, generally, all other movable property existing at the premises No. 12 Kr. Barona iela, Riga; and c) two thirds of the whole of my residuary estate, and 2) my sister Anna Aichers, nee Simsons, and her minor son Peteris Aichers, to whom upon my death passes jointly the remaining one third share of the whole of my estate, with the exception of the property mentioned under IV Section I clauses a and b, but subject to the following provisions:\nThere follow in this paragraph and in para. V directions as to the administration of the one\u2011third share given to Anna and Peteris Aichers which are not relevant.\nParagraph VI deals with the appointment of guardians and the revocation of earlier wills and contains the statement, quoted earlier in these reasons, as to the marriage contract regarding the separation of property.\nIt is common ground that as both Antons and Emilija Benjamins were at all times domiciled in Latvia, where Exhibit 2 was executed, the law of Latvia should govern the construction of this document.\nThe statement of claim contains no allegations as to what is the law of Latvia. The statement of defence makes reference to Latvian law in paras. 9, 11 and 13 which read as follows:\n9. From time to time, including the time of the opening of the above-mentioned account or accounts and depository, Emilija Benjamins transferred thereto monies from her deposit in Berlin and from her property in Latvia left to her separate control by her marriage agreement and the property reserved to her by Latvian law as the proceeds of her work.\n11. The creation and maintenance of the said accounts and depository in Switzerland and England and the addition of monies thereto were prohibited by Latvian law and no lawful transfer or assignment or disposition by will or otherwise in respect thereof was permitted by law either in Latvia or by Latvian citizens and the parties so doing subjected themselves to fines, imprisonment or in the alternative to loss of civil rights. Both Emilija and Antons Benjamins were Latvian citizens and therefore they did not intend the joint will referred to in paragraph 12 infra to embrace the Swiss bank accounts or depository or any other foreign property because a disclosure of their existence either to the Notary, by publication of the will or by the acts relating to probate required on the death of each testator, would subject the survivor or the estate of the deceased testator to the penalties mentioned above.\n13. The said will did not include within its terms the monies and securities of Emilija Benjamins outside Latvia, nor did it cause the transfer of any property of the wife to the husband because he predeceased her, nor did it include the account and depository in the Swiss Bank Corporation because it was regulated by its own special contract, nor did it cause any transfer inter vivos of the property abroad because it was the wife\u2019s separate property inalienable under Latvian law in favour of her consort by a declaration in the manner of this will.\nOn this state of the pleadings three experts, two called by the plaintiff and one by the defendant, were examined and cross-examined as to the law of Latvia and in both Courts below findings were made with regard to that law. The findings made in the Court of Appeal were stated by Aylesworth J.A. as follows:\nMuch evidence was given at trial in respect of the Latvian law relating to the questions in issue between the parties. I shall state in my own words the following propositions which would appear to emerge from that evidence:\n(1) Joint property is held in equal shares by the owners with no Tight in law by survivorship.\n(2) No evidence is admissible to alter or explain, the meaning of a will or the intention of the parties unless the will is ambiguous.\n(3) All dispositions which do not contradict law or common sense shall be interpreted in a manner so as to keep to the extent possible the testament in force.\n(4) Capacity of persons to contract is regulated by the law of the \u2022domicile. If as the result of a marriage contract the parties had separate property this could be altered by a later agreement or by a will.\n(5) Under the old Latvian code in force prior to January 1st, 1938, in the absence of an anti-nuptial contract to the contrary there was community of property between two married people.\n(6) Unless there was an agreement to the contrary the coming into force of the new code on January 1, 1938, did not alter the status of married people and the regime of separate property or community of property, whichever was the case, continued.\n(7) If as a result of marriage contract or otherwise, spouses have separate property, it may become joint by a term in the will to that effect.\n(8) The right of ownership of Antons Benjamins or Emilija Benjamins and their respective heirs to the moneys and assets deposited in the Swiss Bank Corporation in Zurich, Switzerland, and the Swiss Bank Corporation in London, England, did not depend upon the contracts entered into by the depositors with the banks and could be made the subject of contract between Antons and Emilija without the bank being a party thereto. I find it somewhat difficult to discover any sufficient basis in the pleadings to warrant the making of these findings; however, I did not understand either counsel to question the first of them and the appeal was argued on the assumption that under the law of Latvia an item of property which was owned jointly by Antons Benjamins and Emilija Benjamins would on the death of either of them belong one half to the survivor and one half to the estate of the deceased; in other words, that the result would be the same as if in Ontario the item of property had been owned by the spouses as tenants in common. For the purposes of this appeal I accept that assumption.\nWith regard to the moneys deposited with the bank in Zurich I agree with the conclusion arrived at in the Courts below. Those moneys were deposited in the joint names of the spouses. There is no evidence as to the source of the moneys and prima facie they would belong equally to both. I agree with the view of the learned trial judge that the document, Exhibit 4, quoted in part above, defines the rights of the depositors or the survivor of them to withdraw the funds deposited and the right of the bank to make payment and that it does not deal with the ownership of those funds as between the depositors. I agree with the learned trial judge that the decision of this Court in Niles v. Lake[2] is applicable. I base my judgment in this regard not on the terms of the will, Exhibit 2, but on the absence of evidence to rebut the presumption that the moneys belonged to the two depositors in equal shares. In my opinion the appeal in regard to this account fails.\nTurning now to the question of the ownership of the moneys in the bank account in London, as has already been stated, this account was opened in the name of Emilija Benjamins alone. The relationship between her and the bank was that of creditor and debtor. The bank knew no one else in the transaction and clearly it could pay the moneys on deposit to no one other than Emilija; she had the sole legal title to this chose in action and the onus of proving that Antons Benjamins was entitled to any interest in it lay upon the respondent.\nIn answer to a question put by the bench in the course of the argument in this Court counsel for the respondent stated that the plaintiff\u2019s claim was based upon the terms of para. II of the joint last will executed on May 5, 1937, which has already been quoted.\nThe learned trial judge held, on the evidence of the experts as to the law of Latvia, that the will contained no agreement express or implied that it should be irrevocable by either spouse. This finding was not challenged before us. It is in accordance with the law of Ontario, the applicable principles of which are clearly stated in the reasons of Schroeder J., as he then was, in Re Kerr[3].\nThe learned trial judge went on to hold that there was no ambiguity in the language of the will and that it was agreed \u201cthat the word \u2018joint\u2019 as used in connection with \u2018property\u2019 means \u2018equally\u2019, that is that each owns an individual half and with no right of survivorship\u201d.\nThe learned trial judge construed the words in para II, \u201call other property, except of course purely personal property such as clothes, jewellery, etc. is the joint property of both of us irrespective of whether this property is registered in the name of one or both of us\u201d as meaning \u201call the property of the parties of whatsoever kind and wheresoever situate\u201d.\nThe reasons of the learned trial judge dealing with the bank account in London conclude as follows:\nI am therefore finding that the intention of the testators was that the Will should refer to and dispose of all their property as it is described in paragraph III and IV of the Will in the following words:\n...my entire present and future estate immovable and movable, wheresoever the same be situated and of whatsoever it may consist.\nHaving reached this conclusion it is then necessary to determine whether the expression in this Will of such an intention is capable of overriding and revoking the separate property provisions of the marriage contract. The plaintiff\u2019s expert witness Liepins expressed the opinion that this word had \u201cconstitutive\u201d effect, that is, that it created rights, but he was unable to support this opinion by reference to any specific section of the Latvian Civil Code. However the evidence of the defence expert Rusis indicating that a verbal agreement when reduced to writing can create rights and that if the parties signed a written statement indicating their agreement as to ownership of property, it would create rights.\nFrom 1922, the date of the marriage contract, to 1937, the date of the Will, it is clear there had grown up a large and prosperous business enterprise, bringing a substantial improvement in the financial position of the parties. In 1933 a deposit account in both names was opened in a Swiss Bank. From these facts and the general intention throughout the Will, I conclude that there was an agreement between the husband and wife, reduced to writing in the Will, and that this was sufficient to and did override and revoke the marriage contract.\nI should refer to a submission by Mr. Weir that the issues here must be considered as of June, 1939, the date of the death of Antons Benjamins, this being the date when his Will took effect. I do not accept this view. The funds in question are those in existence after the death of both partiesand are subject to a disposition according to a document signed by the wife (as well as the husband) taking effect on her death. From the conclusions above mentioned, it therefore follows that the bank account in London, England is property to be disposed of according to the Will, namely equally between the testator\u2019s estates.\nThe effect of the evidence of the witness Rusis which the learned trial judge accepted is simply that if two parties make a binding oral contract and later sign a written acknowledgment or declaration that they have made such a contract the contract can be enforced. This does not appear to me to differ from the law of Ontario.\nAylesworth J.A., who gave the reasons of the Court of Appeal, was in substantial agreement with the learned trial judge. He construes para. II of the will, \u201ccoupled with the mutual intention to be derived from the whole contents of the will in respect of the estate and property embraced therein\u201d as indicating that there was a prior oral agreement between the spouses that, with the exception of the properties referred to in para. II as being the separate property of Emilija, all property owned by either of them should become the joint property of both and that this agreement applied not only to all property owned at the date of the will but to all property acquired by either thereafter.\nAylesworth J.A. agreed with the view of the learned trial judge that the words of the will were free from ambiguity and that extrinsic evidence of the intention of the parties was rightly excluded.\nIn rejecting the argument of counsel for the appellant that para. II contains no words of promise and that none should be implied, Aylesworth J.A. says:\nHowever, if it be necessary to read into clause II words of promise to make it effective by Latvian law to carry out the intention of the parties then I would not hesitate to do so and would give to the clause the same effect as though it had included an express promise on the part of each of the parties to transfer to the other an equal right, title and interest in all property then possessed or any time thereafter possessed by them or either of them with the exception only of property expressly excluded in the clause. With the greatest respect, I find myself unable to agree with this or with the effect which the Courts below have ascribed to para. II, on which alone is founded the respondent\u2019s claim to a share in the London account.\nI have already quoted, perhaps at undue length, from the provisions of the will.\nIn considering para. II it will first be observed that it is not of testamentary character, it contains no words of gift of anything to anyone. It is a recital of facts, and, in my view, of presently existing facts, as to the extent and ownership of items of property.\nThe first sentence states that two villas are the separate property of Emilija. The next sentence states that \u201call other property except of course purely personal property such as clothes, jewellery, etc. is the joint property of both\u201d irrespective of the name or names in which any particular item is registered. The third sentence states that the facts set out in the second sentence appear, inter alia, from four notarial agreements executed by the spouses in 1922, which are itemized, and concludes:\nbut we consider it expedient to state here the said facts in case the agreements should be lost and to elucidate that the same applies to all our subsequent undertakings, that is to say, that each of us owns an undivided half of all the undertakings.\nWere it not for the presence in the second sentence of para. II of the words \u201cexcept of course purely personal property such as clothes, jewellery, etc.\u201d I would have inclined to agree with the submission of counsel for the appellant that the second and third sentences have reference only to undertakings of a business nature and I am far from satisfied that this submission should be rejected, but, for the purposes of this appeal, I am prepared to accept the view of the Courts below that the meaning of the word \u201cproperty\u201d as used in para. II is not so limited. I cannot however accept the view that the paragraph refers to property to be acquired after the date of the will.\nThe words which I have italicized in the above summary of the provisions of para. II are all in the present tense. It is argued that this is of little significance because by the law of Ontario (and there was neither plea nor proof that the law of Latvia differs on this point) the will is to be construed with reference to the real estate and personal estate comprised in it, to speak and take effect as if it had been executed immediately before the death of the testator, unless a contrary intention appears by the will. With respect, it appears to me that this rule of construction is irrelevant to the question which we have to decide. The rule finds its usual application in determining whether a will disposes of property owned by the testator at the date of his death which he did not own at the date of the will. It does not assist in deciding whether the testator or some other person was the owner of a particular item of property. The question is not whether Antons\u2019 will disposed of his interest in the London account, it is, rather, whether Antons had any interest in that account to dispose of. The following observation in Hawkins on Wills, 2nd ed., at p. 22, is supported by the authorities:\nThe words \u201cwith reference to the real and personal estate comprised in it\u201d mean \u201cso far as the will comprises dispositions of real and personal estate\u201d.\nThere are no words of disposition in para. II; those used elsewhere in the will must be considered in due course.\nArgument was directed to the use of the word \u201csubsequent\u201d in the final sentence of the paragraph. It is used only in connection with the word \u201cundertakings\u201d. This adjective means \u201clater in time than\u201d and, in my view, the \u201csubsequent undertakings\u201d referred to are those entered into by the spouses since the agreements of 1922 up to the time of the signing of the will. To hold, as the Courts below appear to have done, that these words include all future undertakings would seem to require the insertion of the words, italicized below, so that the clause would read:\nand to elucidate that the same applies and shall apply to all our subsequent and future undertakings, that is to say, that each of us owns and shall own an undivided half of all the undertakings.\nThe absence of any words of futurity in para. II has added significance when it is observed that in the opening words of para. III, which follows immediately, future property is expressly referred to. The words are:\nI, Antons Benjamins, appoint as my heirs to my entire present and future estate\nThe opening words of para. IV are similar. When the testator and testatrix intended to deal with future property they said so. I am unable to find in para. II of the will, either standing alone or read as it must be in the context of the whole will, any words of promise as to property to be acquired thereafter by either of the spouses. The will was obviously prepared by a skilful draftsman and I find it difficult to suppose that if the parties had intended it to operate as a contract whereby each agreed to settle all property thereafter acquired by either of them upon both of them jointly plain words would not have been used to effect this result.\nConstrued in the manner most favourable to the respondent which its words will bear para. II is, in my opinion, an acknowledgement by each of the spouses that all property then standing in the names of either or both of them (except the two villas and \u201cpurely personal property\u201d) is the joint property of both. Proceeding on the assumption (which I make for the purposes of this appeal) that this is the correct construction of para. II, the facts from which the ownership of the bank account in London must be determined are the following: (i) in 1922 when the spouses were married the husband was an undischarged bankrupt and the wife was possessed of substantial property; (ii) on May 5, 1937, the spouses were possessed of numerous business enterprises, the farms making up \u201cValdeki\u201d and, no doubt, other properties including the moneys in the bank account in Switzerland and, subject to the exceptions mentioned above, acknowledged that all the property of either of them was the joint property of both; (iii) the terms of the will recognized, and proceeded on the basis, that the spouses were separate as to property, although at the date of the will the separate property of Emilija consisted only of the two villas and \u201cpurely personal property\u201d; (iv) on April 6, 1939, Emilija deposited $110,000 in the bank account in London in her name alone and that sum was standing to her credit when Antons died on June 14, 1939; (v) there is no evidence as to the source of the $110,000.\nI have used above the form of expression that Emilija Benjamins deposited the $110,000 in the bank in London. The evidence is silent as to how or by whom this deposit was made but the combined effect of para. 11 of the statement of claim and para. 10 of the statement of defence is to state that it was made by Emilija. I regard this fact as unimportant. Improper conduct is not presumed and there is nothing in the record to suggest that Emilija would or did take any money which belonged in whole or in part to Antons without his knowledge and consent. The evidence of Anna Aichers tendered at the trial on behalf of the appellant was to the effect that Antons had stated in her presence and that of Emilija that this account was to belong to Emilija but this evidence was rejected by the learned trial judge as inadmissible. Because of the view I take, upon the evidence that was admitted, as to the ownership of this fund, I do not find it necessary to decide whether this evidence of Anna Aichers was rightly rejected and I disregard it.\nNeither in the pleadings nor in the evidence is there anything to suggest that the answer to the question as to the ownership of the money in the London bank account would be different under the law of Latvia from that which should be given under the law of Ontario, which does not differ, in this regard, from the law of England.\nThe situation then is that Emilija, at the date of Antons\u2019 death, had the sole legal ownership of these moneys. There is no evidence that any of the moneys deposited belonged to Antons or were supplied by him or that they were the joint moneys of the spouses; but even had there been such evidence the presumption of a resulting trust, which, but for the relationship between them, would then have arisen from the fact that moneys belonging in whole or in part to Antons had been deposited in the name of Emilija, would be rebutted by the circumstance that the latter was the wife of the former; in the absence of further evidence the law would presume a gift by the husband to the wife. This presumption of gift would in turn be capable of being rebutted by evidence but there is no evidence in the record to rebut it. I have already given my reasons for holding that no contract between the spouses as to the ownership of property acquired after the date of the will was established and I can find no ground for holding that Antons was entitled to any equitable interest in this fund.\nIn the passage from his reasons, quoted above, the learned trial judge mentions as one of the grounds supporting the conclusion at which he arrived that the account opened in Switzerland in 1933 was in both names. With respect, this circumstance seems to me to point in the opposite direction as indicating that when the parties wanted an account to belong to them jointly they opened it in the names of both and not of one only. There is no room for the suggestion that the will of Emilija bequeathed any interest in the London bank account to Antons. Had it done so the benefit conferred would have lapsed on his death. In the clearest terms her will leaves her entire estate to the appellant and to Anna and Peteris Aichers.\nSince Emilija was the sole legal owner of the London bank account the onus of proving that Antons had some equitable interest in it lay upon him, or his personal representative, and it may be observed in passing that there is nothing in the record to shew that the money deposited in the account did not consist of the proceeds of the sale of the villas or of the jewellery, which in any view of the case, were the separate property of Emilija.\nI conclude that at the date of the death of Antons Benjamins and at the date of the death of Emilija Benjamins the latter was the person solely entitled both at law and in equity to the moneys in the London bank account.\nDuring the argument in this Court counsel for the appellant submitted that, if the respondent should be held entitled to a share in either bank account on the ground that Emilija in her lifetime and after her death the appellant were bound to pay the same to Antons or to his estate as a matter of contract, the appellant should be allowed to plead the Statute of Limitations, and asked leave to amend the statement of defence accordingly.\nSince in my view the respondent\u2019s action fails as to the London account it is necessary for me to consider this application in regard to the bank account in Switzerland only.\nAs appears from what I have said above, it is my view that Antons in his lifetime and after his death his estate were entitled to one half of the money in the bank account in Switzerland because Antons and Emilija were joint owners of it without any right of survivorship. When the whole fund came into the hands of the appellant he held one half of it as a constructive trustee for the estate of Antons and it is on that basis that he is liable to account. On this view the statute would not assist the appellant as he still retains or has converted to his own use the half of the fund which should have gone to Antons\u2019 estate. I would refuse the application to amend the statement of defence. I think it only fair to the appellant to add that the record indicates that he acted throughout in the bona fide belief, which turns out to have been mistaken, that on the death of Antons this account became the sole property of Emilija.\nIt remains to consider one further matter raised by counsel for the appellant. He submits that in taking the account directed by the judgment the Master should take into consideration any amounts which the appellant has been called upon to pay to any taxing authority in respect of the income received by him on that part of the fund which should have been paid over to the estate of Antons. In my opinion there is not sufficient evidence in the record to enable us to deal with this question and it should be left to be dealt with by the Master when the relevant facts and figures are before him.\nIn the result, I would dismiss the appeal as to the bank account in Switzerland and allow the appeal as to the bank account in London. I would direct that the formal judgment at the trial, as amended by the judgment of the Court of Appeal, be further amended so that para. I thereof shall read:\n1. This Court doth declare that the plaintiff is entitled to one-half of the amount standing to the credit of Antons Benjamins and Emilija Benjamins in an account in the Swiss Bank Corporation in Zurich, Switzerland, as of the date of the receipt of such moneys by the defendant, and doth order and adjudge the same accordingly.\nand so that cl. (a) of para. 2 thereof shall read:\n(a) The amount of the one-half share of the plaintiff in all moneys and assets received by the defendant in respect to the account referred to in paragraph 1 hereof, after deducting therefrom one-half of such amount as the Master may find to have been reasonably incurred by the defendant in getting into his hands all such moneys and assets, the resulting net amount of the one-half share of the plaintiff to be hereinafter referred to in this paragraph as the \u201cnet amount\u201d.\nAs my view as to the ownership of the London bank account is not shared by the other members of the Court, nothing would be gained by my stating what order as to costs I would have proposed had my view been accepted.\nThe judgment of Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014The circumstances giving rise to this litigation have been fully described in the reasons for judgment of my brother Cartwright which I have had the benefit of reading and I will endeavour not to repeat them to any greater extent than is necessary to make my meaning clear.\nThe late Antons Benjamins and his wife, Emilija, who were separate as to property in accordance with a contract made at or before the time of their marriage, executed a joint will on May 5, 1937, para. II of which reads in part as follows:\nAs regards our estate, we hereby verify that only the two villas which are situate at No. 15 Juras iela, Majori, in the town of Rigas Jurmala, namely the original villa and the villa now added to it\u2026 which form one unit for mortgage purposes, are the separate property of Emilija Benjamins nee Simsons. On the other hand, all other property, except of course purely personal property such as clothes, jewellery, etc. is the joint property of both of us, irrespective of whether this property is registered in the name of one or both of us, and irrespective of whether our various publishing undertakings, enterprises and subsidiary branches should have hitherto been managed, concessioned and registered in the name of one or both of us. This appears, inter alia, from the 4 agreements executed between us in 1922\u2026\nThere follows a description of the property to which these 4 agreements relate and the paragraph then concludes by saying:\n\u2026but we consider it expedient to state here the said facts in case the agreements should be lost, and to elucidate that the same applies to all our subsequent undertakings, that is to say, that each of us owns an undivided half of all the undertakings.\nBoth testators were domiciled in Latvia where Antons Benjamins died on June 14, 1939, and from whence his wife was transported to Russia where she is presumed to have died in 1941.\nThe question at issue in this appeal is whether certain moneys deposited in bank accounts in Zurich, Switzerland and London, England were the separate property of Emilija Benjamins and thus available for distribution amongst her heirs or whether they were the joint property of herself and her husband so as to entitle his heirs to a one-half interest therein.\nThe funds deposited in Zurich were placed in a joint account with the Swiss Bank Corporation on January 23 1933, more than four years before the will was drawn, and for the reasons stated by the Court of Appeal for Ontario as well as those stated by my brother Cartwright, I am of opinion that, notwithstanding the provisions of the \u201cContract Respecting a Joint Account Held Jointly and Severally\u201d entered into between the depositers and the bank, these moneys are to be treated as belonging to the testator and testatrix in equal shares.\nThe London account was opened in the name of the wife alone three months before the death of the husband and two years after the will was drawn and the question of whether or not the heirs of Antons Benjamins became entitled to a one-half interest in these funds in my opinion depends almost entirely upon the construction to be placed on the second paragraph of the will.\nAs has been pointed out by my brother Cartwright, this appeal was argued on the assumption that under the law of Latvia an item of property which was owned jointly by the testator and testatrix would on the death of either of them belong one half to the survivor and one half to the estate of the deceased, and it has been accepted by both the Courts below that the terms of a marriage contract providing that the husband and wife should be separate as to property could be validly revoked under Latvian law so as to make the property of each the joint property of both. The question to be determined is whether under the true construction of the present will the testator and the testatrix intended to achieve and did achieve this end with respect to the funds of unknown origin deposited in the wife\u2019s name in the London account.\nIn the course of the reasons for judgment which he delivered on behalf of the Court of Appeal, Alyesworth J.A. stated the issues in the following terms:\nThe rights of the respondent as administrator with the will annexed to the estate of Antons Benjamins depend primarily on the interpretation and effect in law of the will of the late Antons Benjamins and Emilija Benjamins made in 1937 and from that standpoint it is necessary for the Court initially to determine the rights of the late Antons Benjamins immediately following his death. Nevertheless the action brought by the respondent in form and in substance is for an accounting by the appellant of all assets of the estate of the late Antons Benjamins had and received by the appellant and for all profits derived by the appellant from the use of any and all such assets. Disposition of the issues thus raised is the realistic and far from simple task with which the court must concern itself. The italics are my own.\nThe effect to be given to such a will as this is described in Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England, 3rd ed., vol. 39 at p. 846 where it is said:\nA joint will is a will made by two, or more, testators contained in a single document, duly executed by each testator and disposing either of their separate properties or of their joint property. It is not, however, recognized in English law as a single will. It is in effect two or more wills; it operates on the death of each testator as his will disposing of his own separate property; on the death of the first to die it is admitted to probate as his own will and on the death of the survivor, if no fresh will has been made, it is admitted to probate as the disposition of the property of the survivor.\nThe italics are my own.\nThese observations are based on such authorities as In the Goods of Raine[4]; Re Duddell, Roundway v. Roundway[5]; they received the express approval of Doull J. in Re Creelman, Mclntyre v. Gushue et al.[6], and the acceptance of the principle so stated is implicit in the decision of Schroeder J. in Re Kerr[7].\nHaving regard to all the above and in the absence of any evidence of a contrary rule prevailing under Latvian law, I think it is to be accepted that on the death of Antons Benjamins his will became effective to control the disposition of a one-half interest in any property which was at that time jointly held by himself and his wife.\nThe question of whether the London bank account was so jointly held depends as I have indicated upon the construction to be placed on the second paragraph of the will. In my view this paragraph is not only descriptive of the understanding existing between husband and wife at the time of preparing the will as to joint ownership of certain property therein referred to, but it also manifests the intention of both of them that on the death of each his or her will is to be treated as an effective disposition of one half of such property.\nIn this regard I adopt the following passage from the reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice Aylesworth:\nThe facts that the parties had knowledge of the existence and effect of the marriage contract and the terms thereof at the time the will was made, and that they made the declaration appearing in clause II, coupled with the mutual intention to be derived from the whole contents of the will in respect of the estate and property embraced therein\u2014all these considerations afford sufficient evidence to infer that there was a prior oral agreement between the spouses; in other words it was understood and agreed between them that their respective estates including \u201call other property\u201d save as expressly excepted in clause II of the will, should be the joint property of both from and after the date of the will.\nI am of opinion also that the words \u201cas regards our estate\u2026\u201d which occur at the beginning of the second paragraph are to be construed as meaning \u201cas regards the estate hereinafter disposed of\u201d and that the words \u201call other property except of course purely personal property such as clothes, jewellery, etc. is the joint property of both of us\u2026\u201d are sufficiently broad to include moneys on deposit in a bank in the names of either the testator or testatrix or both of them.\nThe only question remaining to be determined is whether the language of the second paragraph is to be treated as relating only to the property owned by the Benjamins at the time when the will was made, or whether it is to be so construed as to include property thereafter acquired by either of them.\nI agree with my brother Cartwright that in the absence of evidence of any Latvian law to the contrary the will is to be construed in accordance with the provisions of s. 26(1) of The Wills Act, R.S.O.1960, c. 433 which read as follows:\n26(1) Every will shall be construed, with reference to the real estate and personal estate comprised in it, to speak and take effect as if it had been executed immediately before the death of the testator, unless a contrary intention appears by the will.\nThis section has been interpreted as applying only \u201cin so far as the will comprises dispositions of real and personal estate\u201d (see Hawkins on Wills, 2nd ed., p. 22, Re Karch[8], per Middleton J. at 511 and 512, In Re Chapman, Perkins v. Chapman[9], per Vaughan Williams L.J. at 435), and it is contended that the second paragraph of the present will is concerned with the recital of facts rather than the disposition of property and that it should accordingly be construed without reference to the statute. In my view, however, the paragraph in question is descriptive of the understanding of the husband and wife as to the nature of the interest of each of them in \u201cthe real and personal estate comprised in\u201d the dispositions which are the subject of the succeeding paragraphs, and unless a contrary intention can be found in the language of the will it is to be construed as though it had been executed immediately before the death of Antons Benjamins.\nIt is also contended on behalf of the appellant that the second paragraph is to be treated as referable only to property owned at the date of the will because the provisions declaring the estate to be \u201cthe joint property of both of us\u201d are phrased in the present tense and that there are no words which expressly include the after-acquired property of either of the parties, but the reference to \u201call other property except of course purely personal property\u2026\u201d is general rather than specific and the principle to be applied appears to me to be well summarized in the decision of Middleton J. in Re Ingram[10], at p. 97 where it is said:\nThe true principle is happily stated by Spragge, C.J.O. in Vansickle v. Vansickle (1884), 9 A.R. 352, 354: \u201cI take the proper course to be, to read the will assuming that the testator had read it immediately (using that word as meaning very shortly) before his death, and that, seeing nothing in it that he desired to change, and knowing that it would be read as the then expression of his will and intention, he had chosen to leave it as it was, although, if the rule of construction had been otherwise, and his will was to be read as expressing his intention at its date, he would, when reading it shortly before his death, have made alterations which\u2014the rule being as it is\u2014he judged not to be necessary. This of course can only be where a contrary intention does not appear by the will itself\u201d.\nFrom all the cases two other general principles can be deduced. First, when the words used to describe either real or personal property given are general, they will pass all property which falls within the words used, looking at the will as though executed immediately before death. Second, when the property given is specifically described, the specific description is not enlarged by the statutory rule of construction.\nThe italics are my own.\nIn my opinion, the employment of the present tense in conjunction with a general description of property does not of itself constitute evidence of \u201ca contrary intention\u201d within the meaning of s. 26(1) of The Wills Act, and with the greatest respect for those who may hold a different view, I am unable to find any language in the will which limits the joint estate created by the second paragraph to personal property owned by the testator and testatrix at the date when the will was made.\nFor these reasons as well as for those contained in the reasons for judgment of Aylesworth J.A. I agree with the conclusion which he expressed in the following language:\nI conclude that at the time of the death of Antons Benjamins he had the right to one-half of the moneys and securities on deposit in the Swiss Bank Corporation in Zurich, Switzerland and to one-half of the moneys on deposit in the name of Emilija Benjamins in the Swiss Bank Corporation in London, England. It is not suggested that subsequent to his death his rights changed in any way up to the date of the receipt by the appellant of all the moneys and securities in both bank accounts.\nWhen the funds in both bank accounts came into the hands of the appellant he held one half of them as constructive trustee for the estate of Antons Benjamins and I adopt the reasoning of my brother Cartwright with respect to the Statute of Limitations in this regard. It is on this basis that the appellant is liable to account, and I agree with Aylesworth J.A. that the accounts and inquiries should be taken in accordance with the directions given in the order granted by Mr. Justice Schatz subject to the amendment made by order of the Court of Appeal for Ontario. I agree also with Mr. Justice Cartwright that, in taking the accounts, the question of whether consideration should be given to any amounts which the appellant has been called upon to pay to any taxing authority in respect of the income received by him on the fund, is one which should be left to be dealt with by the master when the relevant facts and figures are before him.\nI would accordingly dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, CARTWRIGHT J. dissenting in part.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Mason, Foulds, Arnup, Walter, Weir & Boeckh, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: Taylor, Joy & Baker, Toronto.\n[1] [1964] 1 O.R. 47, 41 D.L.R.

During its 1958 fiscal year, it sold its assets to a \"successor corporation\" within the meaning of s. 83A (8a) of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148. In its income tax return for that year, the appellant claimed a deduction in respect of its drilling and exploration expenses as it would be normally entitled to do under s. 83A (3) of the Act. The Minister ruled that because of that sale, which brought into operation the provisions of subs. (8a), the deduction was not permissible. Both the Income Tax Appeal Board and the Exchequer Court upheld the Minister. The taxpayer appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nWhen subparagraphs (iii) and (iv) of paragraph (e) of subsection (8a) are read together the aggregate which is defined in paragraph (e) is to consist of expenses not deductible by the \"predecessor corporation\" in the taxation year in which the property was acquired by the \"successor corporation\", but which would have been deductible by the \"predecessor corporation\" in that taxation year but for the provisions of the subsection. In the present case the appellant, pursuant to subs. (3), would have been entitled to deduct the expenses in question had it not been for the words contained in the last paragraph of subs. (8a). Reading para. (8a) as a whole, it contemplates that only the \"successor corporation\" was entitled to claim a deduction in respect of the expenses in question, for the taxation year in which the transfer of assets occurred.\nRevenu\u2014Imp\u00f4t sur le revenu\u2014Compagnie de p\u00e9trole\u2014D\u00e9ductions\u2014D\u00e9penses de forage et d'exploration sont-elles d\u00e9ductibles par la \u00ab corporation remplac\u00e9e \u00bb pour la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e d'imposition durant laquelle elle a vendu ses biens \u00e0 une \u00ab corporation rempla\u00e7ante \u00bb\u2014Loi de l'imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, S.R.C. 1952, c. 148, s. 83A(3), (8a).\nLa compagnie appelante s'occupait principalement de la production du p\u00e9trole et de l'exploration pour la d\u00e9couverte du p\u00e9trole et du gas naturel.

Appel rejet\u00e9.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Dumoulin J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada[2] , affirming the decision of the Income Tax Appeal Board. Appeal dismissed.\nKenneth E. Meredith, for the appellant.\nE. S. MacLatchy, Q.C., for the respondent. The judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[3] , which confirmed the decision of the Income Tax Appeal Board that, for the taxation year 1958, the appellant was not entitled to deduct from its income the amount of $29,136 which it had claimed the right to deduct under the provisions of subs. (3) of s. 83A of the Income Tax Act.\nThe appellant is a public company incorporated in the Province of British Columbia. Its business, during the taxation year which ended on June 30, 1958, was the production of petroleum and the exploring for petroleum and natural gas. Prior to that date and after the calendar year 1952, it had incurred drilling and exploration expenses that were not deductible from its income in previous years in the amount of $95,614.57.\nDuring the fiscal year which ended on June 30, 1958, and prior to that date, the appellant sold its assets to Freehold Gas & Oil Ltd. (N.P.L.), hereinafter referred to as \"Freehold\". The appellant, in its income tax return for that fiscal year, claimed as a deduction $29,136, the equivalent of its net profit for that year, and relied upon subs. (3) of s. 83A of the Income Tax Act to justify such deduction.\nThe effect of subs. (3) is to enable an oil company to deduct, from its income for the taxation year, exploration and drilling expenses, incurred after the calendar year 1952, to the extent that they were not deductible in computing income for a previous taxation year, in an amount not exceeding its income for the taxation year in question.\nIt is conceded by the respondent that the appellant's claim for a deduction from income under this subsection would have been valid had it not been for the sale of its assets to Freehold in the taxation year involved. The respondent contends, however, that because of that sale, which brings into operation the provisions of subs. (8a), the deduction was not permissible. The portions of subs. (8a), as it existed at the times material to these proceedings and which are relevant to this appeal, are as follows:\n(8a) Notwithstanding subsection (8), where a corporation (hereinafter in this subsection referred to as the \"successor corporation\") whose principal business is\n(a) production, refining or marketing of petroleum, petroleum products or natural gas, or exploring or drilling for petroleum or natural gas, or\n(b) mining or exploring for minerals,\nhas, at any time after 1954, acquired from a corporation (hereinafter in this subsection referred to as the \"predecessor corporation\") whose principal business was production, refining or marketing of petroleum, petroleum products or natural gas, exploring or drilling for petroleum or natural gas, or mining or exploring for minerals, all or substantially all of the property of the predecessor corporation used by it in carrying on that business in Canada,\n(Paragraphs (c) and (d) not material.)\nthere may be deducted by the successor corporation, in computing its income under this Part for a taxation year, the lesser of\n(e) the aggregate of\n(i) the drilling and exploration expenses, including all general geological and geophysical expenses, incurred by the predecessor corporation on or in respect of exploring or drilling for petroleum or natural gas in Canada, and\n(ii) the prospecting, exploration and development expenses incurred by the predecessor corporation in searching for minerals in Canada,\nto the extent that such expenses\n(iii) were not deductible by the successor corporation in computing its income for a previous taxation year, and were not deductible by the predecessor corporation in computing its income for the taxation year in which the property so acquired was acquired by the successor corporation or its income for a previous taxation year, and\n(iv) would, but for the provisions of paragraph (b) of subsection (1), paragraph (b) of subsection (2), paragraph (d) of subsection (3) and paragraph (d) of subsection (8) or of any of those paragraphs or this subsection, have been deductible by the predecessor corporation in computing its income for the taxation year in which the property so acquired was acquired by the successor corporation, or\n(Paragraph (f) not material.) and, in respect of any such expenses included in the aggregate determined under paragraph (e), no deduction may be made under this section by the predecessor corporation in computing its income for the taxation year in which the property so acquired was acquired by the successor corporation or its income for any subsequent taxation year.\nThe submission of the appellant is that subpara. (iii) of para. (e) of this subsection clearly contemplates the deduction by the appellant of drilling and exploration expenses in the taxation year in which it sold its assets to Freehold because, in defining the \"aggregate\" which the successor corporation may deduct, it refers to expenses \"not deductible by the predecessor corporation in computing its income for the taxation year in which the property so acquired was acquired by the successor corporation.\" The appellant contends, on the basis of this wording, that the subsection contemplates that the successor corporation cannot include in its aggregate those expenses which the predecessor corporation may itself deduct in respect of its income for the taxation year in which the property was acquired by the successor corporation.\nThe respondent relies upon the words which follow para. (f) of the subsection: \"and, in respect of any such expenses included in the aggregate determined under paragraph (e), no deduction may be made under this section by the predecessor corporation in computing its income for the taxation year in which the property so acquired was acquired by the successor corporation.\" The respondent contends that these are the governing words to which meaning must be attributed. As was pointed out in the reasons for the decision of the Income Tax Appeal Board, the words quoted immediately above would have no effect if the contention made by the appellant were to be adopted.\nThe wording of subs. (8a) is complicated and its meaning is far from clear. I have, however, reached the conclusion that the contention of the appellant fails because, while relying on the wording of subpara. (iii) of para. (e), it does not take into account the wording of subpara. (iv). When the two subparagraphs are read together, it appears to me that the \"aggregate\" which is defined in para. (e) is to con- sist of expenses not deductible by the predecessor corporation in the taxation year in which the property was acquired by the successor corporation, but which would have been deductible by the predecessor corporation in that taxation year, \"but for the provisions of\u2026 this subsection.\"\nIn the present case the appellant, pursuant to subs. (3), would have been entitled to deduct the expenses in question in the taxation year in question had it not been for the words contained in the last paragraph of subs. (8a). They are, therefore, to be included in the aggregate in respect of which Freehold may claim a deduction for the taxation year in question and they may not be deducted by the appellant in computing its income for that year.\nIn my opinion, therefore, the appellant's argument, based upon the wording of subpara. (iii), fails and, reading subpara. (8a) as a whole, it is my view that it contemplates that only the successor corporation was entitled to claim a deduction, in respect of the expenses in question, for the taxation year in which the transfer of assets occurred. The appeal should, therefore, be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Meredith & Company, Vancouver.\nSolicitor for the respondent: E. S.

Retail Credit Co. et al., [1965] S.C.R. 297\nDate: 1965-03-01\nVictor M. Gaskin (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nRetail Credit Co., John Herbert and T.J. Kelly (Defendants) Respondents.\n1964: December 18; 1965: March 1.\nPresent: Cartwright, Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nLibels\u2014Credit reports on plaintiff requested by clients of defendant company\u2014Reports prepared and sent out to clients\u2014No evidence of letters having been mailed or received\u2014Whether burden of proving publication discharged\u2014Question for jury\u2019s determination.\nThe defendant company was in the business of furnishing credit reports to its clients. Three of those clients requested credit reports concerning the plaintiff and such reports were \u201csent\u201d by the defendant. The plaintiff brought an action for libel, claiming that the reports were defamatory. The trial judge upon motion made by counsel for the defendant for nonsuit withdrew the case from the jury and dismissed the action. The plaintiff\u2019s appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed by a majority of that Court. Both the trial judge and the majority of the Court of Appeal held that there was no evidence of publication fit for submission to the jury. A further appeal by the plaintiff was brought to this Court.\nHeld (Judson J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed; new trial directed.\nPer Cartwright, Martland, Ritchie and Spence JJ.: The question of whether or not the burden of proving publication had been discharged was one which should be left for the jury to determine, if there was any evidence from which it might reasonably be concluded to be more probable than not that a defamatory statement concerning the plaintiff had been made known to a third party or parties.\nThe defendant\u2019s contention that the authorities had established an exhaustive and closed category of circumstances from which publication could be inferred was not accepted. If the plaintiff proved facts from which it could reasonably be inferred that the words complained of were brought to the knowledge of some third person, a prima facie case was established.\nIn the present case there was no evidence of letters having been posted, or of their having been received by the addressees, but this did not mean that the jury should be deprived of the opportunity of drawing the inference, if they should see fit to do so, that credit reports sent by the defendant company to its customers were likely to have been received and read by them.\nPer Judson J., dissenting: As held by the trial judge and the majority of the Court of Appeal, the evidence of publication in this case was not enough. The plaintiff, in an action of this kind, had the advantage of the two presumptions of falsity and damage but not of a third presumption of publication. APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Kelly J. Appeal allowed and new trial directed, Judson J. dissenting.\nC.L. Dubin, Q.C., and P.J. Brunner, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nHon. D.J. Walker, Q.C., and J.W. Burridge, Q.C., for the defendants, respondents.\nThe judgment of Cartwright, Martland, Ritchie and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for the Province of Ontario1 whereby the majority of that Court, with MacKay J.A. dissenting, dismissed the appellant\u2019s appeal from an order made by Mr. Justice Kelly, who had directed that the case be taken from the jury and the action dismissed, pursuant to the granting of a motion for nonsuit made by counsel for the present respondent which was based on the contention that no evidence had been adduced by the plaintiff in proof of the publication of the libels alleged in the pleadings, or of the identity of the present appellant as the person defamed.\nThe members of the Court of Appeal were unanimously of the opinion, which I share, that the appellant had been shown to be the person defamed, but McGillivray J.A., with whose reasons for judgment Porter C.J.O. agreed, took the view that evidence of credit reports having been sent out by the respondent at the request of its clients did not constitute evidence of publication of the contents of those reports.\nThere can be no doubt that proof of publication is an essential element in an action for libel and that the burden of proving this element lies upon the plaintiff. The question of whether or not that burden has been discharged is, in my opinion, one which should be left for the jury to determine, if there is any evidence from which it might reasonably be concluded to be more probable than not that a defamatory statement concerning the plaintiff has been made known to a third party or parties. In this regard, I adopt the summary of the authorities, which is given in Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England, vol. 24, p. 39, where it is stated:\nIf publication is disputed by the defendant and there is any evidence of publication by him, it must be left to the jury to decide whether there was in fact publication of the libel by him.\nThe reasons for judgment, which were delivered by McGillivray J.A., on behalf of the Court of Appeal appear to me to be founded in large measure on a quotation from Button on Libel and Slander at p. 68 which reads in part as follows:\nIn the case of libel publication must be proved, as a rule by calling a witness to say that the libel was read; but in certain cases of libel the plaintiff is assisted by certain presumptions which are made in his favour, which it is for the defendant to rebut if he can.\nThe learned author goes on to cite certain circumstances which have been held by the Courts in England to give rise to a \u201cpresumption\u201d that a statement has been published and he concludes by saying:\nIn all other cases the plaintiff must establish affirmatively that there was publication to a third person. Where publication is denied, it is generally easily proved by means of interrogatories.\nFrom the language of this passage McGillivray J.A. concluded:\nThe exceptions to the rule that publication must be affirmatively established as they appear in the above abstract are the same or similar to those referred to in the other standard texts where similar statements of the law are made. The exceptions appear to fall into two groups\u2014the first is where it is established that a letter to the addressee has been properly posted and the second is when a communication has been sent by telegram or through the mail in open form or has remained posted on a wall or elsewhere where some members of the public may see it. The evidence in the present instance does not fall into either category and all affirmative evidence is lacking. Evidence that reports went, or were made, sent or forwarded (in the case of one witness he was not sure whether the reports had been sent to his office in London or forwarded to the parties for whom they were made) does not come within the exceptions mentioned and by no stretch of the imagination is it evidence of receipt by the parties concerned. The objection taken as to weight to be given this evidence may be called technical but it is by no means unimportant for if this requirement as to publication, which could have been readily satisfied by proper questions upon the examination for discovery or by calling the alleged recipient of the document or its representative, is not insisted upon in this case one is driven to inquire how far the principle is to be extended in other cases upon other sets of facts.\nIt was strongly contended by counsel for the respondent that the English cases referred to in Button on Libel and Slander and in other text-books established an exhaustive and closed category of circumstances from which publication could be inferred and it appears that McGillivray J.A. subscribed to this view.\nIn my opinion, however, the general principle is correctly stated in Gatley on Libel and Slander, at p. 89, where it is said:\nIt is not necessary for the plaintiff in every case to prove directly that the words complained of were brought to the actual knowledge of some third person. If he proves facts from which it can reasonably be inferred that the words were brought to the knowledge of some third person, he will establish a prima facie case.\nAs has been indicated, there is evidence in the present case to the effect that the respondent was in the business of furnishing credit reports to its clients, that some of those clients requested credit reports concerning the appellant and that such reports were \u201csent\u201d by the respondent.\nIt is true that there is no evidence of letters having been posted, or of their having been received by the addressees, but this does not, in my opinion, mean that the jury should be deprived of the opportunity of drawing the inference, if they should see fit to do so, that credit reports sent by Retail Credit Company to its customers are likely to have been received and read by them.\nI agree with MacKay J.A., when he says in the course of his dissenting judgment:\n\u2026I think it would have been open to the jury to draw the inference of publication or to reject the evidence as being insufficient to prove publication, but I think it should have been left to the jury.\nThe appellant contends that when respondent\u2019s counsel moved for a nonsuit, he elected to call no evidence and that he is now precluded from doing so, with the result that judgment should be entered in the plaintiff\u2019s favour and a new trial directed for the purpose of assessing the damages only. In this latter regard the leading cases in Ontario are summarized in the decision of Harvey C.J.A. in Hayhurst v. Innisfail Motors Ltd.[2], at p. 277, where he says:\n\u2026we see no reason why we should not apply the same rule of practice as that of Ontario. It is to be understood therefore that for the future when a defendant applies for a dismissal at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case he does so at the risk of not having the right to give any evidence on his own behalf for if the trial Judge grants his application and the Appellate Court comes to the conclusion that it was wrong it will feel itself at liberty to finally dispose of the case on the evidence already given and will do so unless in its own discretion it considers that in the interests of justice some other course should be taken.\nThis statement was cited with approval in this Court in Modern Construction Ltd. v. Maritime Rock Products Ltd.[3]\nIn my view, under the somewhat peculiar circumstances of this case, and having regard to the fact that the trial took place before a jury which was never given the opportunity of determining the issue of publication, I think there should be a new trial of the whole issue. I am, however, of opinion that the respondent should bear the costs of the first trial.\nFor these reasons, as well as for those stated in the dissenting opinion of MacKay J.A., I would allow this appeal and direct that there be a new trial. The appellant will also have his costs in this Court and in the Court of Appeal.\nJUDSON J. (dissenting):\u2014Both the learned trial judge and the majority of the Court of Appeal have held that there was in this case no evidence of publication fit for submission to the jury. The evidence on this subject was scanty in the extreme and consisted only of extracts from three examinations for discovery read into the record. It was set out in full in the majority reasons delivered in the Court of Appeal. I agree with the trial judge and the majority of the Court of Appeal that it was not enough.\nIt amounts to no more than this\u2014that the reports were ordered, prepared and sent out to three companies. It does not appear who sent them or when they were sent or to what address they were sent. There is no evidence that any particular third person read them at all. The plaintiff, in an action of this kind, has the advantage of the two presumptions of falsity and damage but not of a third presumption of publication.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs, new trial directed, JUDSON J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Young & Hutchinson, Woodstock.\nSolicitors for the defendants, respondents: Nesbitt & Burridge, Woodstock.\n[1] [1964] 1 O.R. 530, 43 D.L.R.

Dalrymple (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1964: December 14, 15, 16, 17; 1965: March 1.\nPresent: Cartwright, Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nSlander\u2014Qualified privilege\u2014Whether sufficient evidence of malice to warrant the question of malice or the absence of malice being put before the jury.\nThe plaintiff, a local manager of the defendant company, brought action against the company and three employees thereof for damages for alleged slander uttered by the three employees in the course of their duties for their employer. The plaintiff had been engaged in a dispute for some time with his head office concerning decisions made there in connection with the management of his district. Eventually the plaintiff submitted his resignation and at the same time told the company that he expected that a number of agents would be resigning with him. Subsequently the company sent men to persuade the agents not to resign.\nAt the close of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence at the trial, the defendants moved to dismiss the action on the ground that the alleged slanders were uttered on an occasion of privelege and that there was no evidence of express malice. The trial judge held that the alleged slanders were uttered on occasions of qualified privilege and that the plaintiff had failed to adduce sufficient evidence of express malice to justify sending the case to the jury. On an appeal by the plaintiff, the Court of Appeal in its judgment presumed without deciding that the trial judge had been correct in holding that the occasions were occasions of qualified privilege but differed with the trial judge in holding that there was both extrinsic and intrinsic evidence of express malice giving a sufficient probability to warrant the question of malice or not being put to the jury. The defendants appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Judson J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Cartwright and Ritchie JJ.: The trial judge was justified in concluding that the words complained of were spoken on occasions of qualified privilege, but he erred in holding that there was no evidence upon which a properly instructed jury could find that they were spoken maliciously. Whether the words were in fact spoken maliciously was a different question and one upon which the plaintiff was entitled to the verdict of a jury based upon evidence to be adduced at a new trial.\nPer Martland J.: There was sufficient evidence of malice to warrant the question of malice or the absence of malice being put before the jury. Consequently, even assuming, in favour of the defendants, that the occasions in question were occasions of qualified privilege, a new trial should be directed.\nPer Spence J.: On the question of whether the alleged slanders were or were not spoken on occasions of qualified privilege, the occasion advanced by counsel for the defendants was that the individual defendants as company officers were concerned with what they believed to be a wholesale resignation of agents in the local area. That situation was one with which they could validly be concerned. Statements which were fairly made by a person in the conduct of his own affairs in matters where his own interest was concerned were prima facie privileged. The plaintiff\u2019s contention that the occasion of privilege had been lost could not, on the evidence, be accepted.\nThere was the further question whether the statements made by the individual defendants were so irrelevant to the proper protection of their employer\u2019s interest that the privilege was lost. The comments could be described as being an attempt to show to the agents that their loyalty to the plaintiff was not justified in their own interests. It might well be said that these comments, if they were justified in evidence given by the defendants, or reasonable grounds for them found, would not be irrelevant to the attempt to retain the agents in the service of the company.\nThe alleged slanders, therefore, were all uttered on occasions of qualified privilege. However, there was both extrinsic and intrinsic evidence of express malice on the part of each of the individual defendants. Although upon an occasion held to be one of qualified privilege the court, in determining whether there is any evidence of malice fit to be left to the jury, will not look too narrowly on the language used in the alleged slander, the slander if utterly beyond and disproportionate to the facts may provide evidence of excess malice. Moreover, one piece of evidence tending to establish malice was sufficient evidence on which a jury could find for the plaintiff and therefore if more than a mere scintilla, it should be submitted to the jury for its finding of fact.\nToogood v. Spyring (1834), 1 Cr. M. & R. 181; Halls v. Mitchell, [1928] S.C.R. 125; Adam v. Ward, [1917] A.C. 309; Jerome v. Anderson, [1964] S.C.R. 291; Taylor et al. v.

Viscount Chelmsford et al., [1964] 3 All E.R. 406, referred to.\nPer Judson J., dissenting: There was no evidence of malice in this case fit to be considered by the jury. There was nothing in the evidence to indicate that the individual defendants did not believe in any of the statements that they made or that in the circumstances known to them, it would have been unreasonable to believe in these statements. Nor were the statements so disproportionate to the occasion as to provide evidence in themselves that they were using the occasion for an improper purpose.\nIn order to have the question of malice submitted to the jury, it was necessary that the evidence should raise a probability of malice and be more consistent with its existence than its non-existence. The problem did not arise here at all. It was a case of reasonable, honest persuasion in the protection of a clearly established reciprocal interest.\nArnott v. College of Physicians and Surgeons of Saskatchewan, [1954] S.C.R. 538; Adam v. Ward, supra; Taylor et al. v. Despard et al., supra, referred to.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario allowing an appeal from a judgment of Richardson J. and directing a new trial of the plaintiff\u2019s action for slander. Appeal dismissed, Judson J. dissenting.\nC.L. Dubin, Q.C., and P.J. Brunner, for the defendants, appellants.\nR.N. Starr, Q.C., for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of Cartwright and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014I agree that this appeal should be disposed of in the manner proposed by my brother Spence.\nOn the evidence before him the learned trial judge was in my view justified in concluding that the words complained of were spoken on occasions of qualified privilege, but he erred in holding that there was no evidence upon which a properly instructed jury could find that they were spoken maliciously. Whether the words were in fact spoken maliciously is a different question and one upon which the respondent is entitled to the verdict of a jury based upon evidence to be adduced at a new trial.\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014I am in agreement with the conclusion reached by my brother Spence and by the Court of Appeal of Ontario that there was, in this case, sufficient evidence of malice to warrant the question of malice or the absence of malice being put before the jury. Consequently, even assuming, in favour of the appellants, that the occasions in question were occasions of qualified privilege, I am of the opinion that a new trial should be directed. That being so, I prefer not to express any opinion as to whether or not the occasions in question were, in fact, occasions of qualified privilege.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs.\nJUDSON J. (dissenting):\u2014I agree with the learned trial judge that there was no evidence of malice in this case fit to be considered by the jury. The Court of Appeal directed a new trial on the ground that the evidence adduced by the plaintiff raised a sufficient probability of malice to warrant this question being put before the jury.\nThe plaintiff, a local manager of the defendant company at Peterborough, had been engaged in a dispute for some time with his head office concerning decisions made there in connection with the management of his district. The rights and wrongs of the dispute do not in any way determine the issues in this action. The plaintiff had one view, which he did not hesitate to express, and the company another. Eventually the plaintiff submitted his resignation and at the same time told the company that he expected that a number of agents would be resigning with him. This was a serious threatened disruption of the company\u2019s business in this district. They were justified in treating it seriously and they sent men to persuade the agents not to resign but to stay with the company.\nThere is nothing in the evidence to indicate that the individual defendants, who were head office employees of the company, did not believe in any of the statements that they made or that in the circumstances known to them, it would have been unreasonable to believe in these statements. Nor were the statements so disproportionate to the occasion as to provide evidence in themselves that they were using the occasion for an improper purpose.\nIn order to have the question of malice submitted to the jury, it is necessary that the evidence should raise a probability of malice and be more consistent with its existence than its non-existence. I cannot see that this problem arises here at all. My opinion at the end of four days\u2019 argument in this Court was that this was a case of reasonable, honest persuasion in the protection of a clearly-established reciprocal interest.\nThe learned trial judge showed by his ruling that he was of the same opinion. He was in the best position to judge. He had watched and heard from start to finish the unfolding of this case with all its emphasis on the spoken word and its exaggeration of the trivialities of discussion on both sides. I think that he ruled correctly in accordance with the judgment of Kerwin C.J., and Estey J., in Arnott v. College of Physicians and Surgeons of Saskatchewan[1], and its foundation in Adam v. Ward[2], and the judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal in Taylor et al. v. Despard et al.[3]\nI would allow the appeal with costs both here and in the Court of Appeal and restore the judgment at trial.\nSPENCE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario pronounced on November 5, 1964, on an appeal from the judgment of Richardson J. at trial dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s action.\nThis is an action against the Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada and three employees thereof, W.G. Attridge, the director of agencies, and A.G. Dennis and Blythe Moore, two supervisors of agencies, for damages for alleged slander uttered by the three employees on the 13th, 14th and 15th of January 1960 in the course of their duties for their employer.\nAt the close of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence at the trial, the defendant moved to dismiss the action on the ground that the alleged slanders were uttered on an occasion of privilege and that there was no evidence of express malice. After a very lengthy argument, the trial judge held that the alleged slanders were uttered on occasions of qualified privilege and that the plaintiff had failed to adduce sufficient evidence of express malice to justify sending the case to the jury.\nThe Court of Appeal for Ontario in an oral judgment given at the close of the argument, presumed without deciding that the trial judge had been correct in holding that the occasions were occasions of qualified privilege but differed with the trial judge in holding that there was both extrinsic and intrinsic evidence of express malice giving a sufficient probability to warrant the question of malice or not being put to the jury. The defendants appealed to this Court.\nConsiderable argument in this Court was concerned with the question of whether the alleged slanders were or were not spoken on occasions of qualified privilege. The occasion advanced by counsel for the appellant was that the individual defendants as company officers were concerned with what they believed to be a wholesale resignation of agents in the Peterborough branch territory including the district offices in Peterborough, Trenton and Oshawa. That situation was one with which they could validly be concerned as it was said in evidence that a very large sum of money must be expended to establish a branch agency of the company and train the agents. Statements which are fairly made by a person in the conduct of his own affairs in matters where his own interest is concerned are prima facie privileged: Toogood v. Spyring[4], at p. 193; Halls v. Mitchell[5], per Duff J. at p. 132; Gatley on Libel and Slander, 5th ed., p. 253.\nThe respondent\u2019s submission was that almost immediately upon the arrival of Messrs. Dennis and Moore at the branch office in Peterborough and the district office in Oshawa, respectively, they were re-assured upon the topic of the feared resignation of the agents and that therefore they knew the occasion for privilege did not exist in fact, yet they continued to utter and to repeat the alleged slanders. I am of the opinion that this is too cursory a view of the evidence.\nThe plaintiff in telephone conversation with the defendant Attridge on January 13 had informed Attridge that he, Dalrymple, was resigning and that others would follow, perhaps as many as 8 or 9. The plaintiff in conference with the defendant Dennis on the morning of January 14 in Peterborough had answered when the defendant Dennis read out a list of the names of the agents that a similar number might well resign. The individual defendants were surely justified in taking the view that these agents when purporting to disavow to them, the defendants, their intentions to resign were not altogether frank and that such intention to resign did exist, despite their declarations. There was considerable justification for this belief shown, inter alia, in two pieces of evidence. Firstly, Moore, in Oshawa, had attempted to have the various agents there \u201cmake a commitment\u201d, i.e., undertake that they would not resign, and failed to obtain this undertaking. Secondly, on January 15, when the agents met in Cobourg, and invited the defendants Dennis and Moore to attend this meeting, which invitation the defendants had refused, the agents passed a resolution the second part of which was a declaration that if the plaintiff were not reinstated they would all resign. It is true that the plaintiff insisted that this second part of the resolution should be eliminated as it might have been interpreted as a threat, but the incident does indicate that there was a real possibility of wholesale resignations continuing up to as late as January 15. On this evidence, I could not accept the view that the occasion of privilege had been lost.\nThere is a further grave question whether the statements made by the three individual defendants were so irrelevant to the proper protection of their employer\u2019s interest that the privilege was lost. Certainly, statements irrelevant to protecting the interests will result in loss of privilege: Adam v. Ward[6], per Lord Loreburn, at pp. 320-1, Lord Dunedin, pp. 326-7, and Gatley, op. cit., pp. 267ff.\nWere the comments irrelevant? The comments may be generally described as being an attempt to show to the agents that their loyalty to the plaintiff was one not justified in their own interests. The defendants Dennis and Moore attempted this by saying to the agents that this man whom they admired so much was one who had previously made a threat to resign and that then he had waited until his pension had vested so that he would suffer no financial loss upon his resignation, while they, on the other hand, having had much shorter employment, would, if they resigned, have no benefit from vested pensions and that in addition the plaintiff was a troublemaker not only within the company but in dealing with others outside the company. It might well be that if these comments were justified in evidence given by the defendants, or reasonable grounds for them found, these comments would not be irrelevant to the attempt to retain the agents in the service of the company. The agents\u2019 loyalty to the plaintiff was certainly a very moving factor. It was not the sole factor. The loyalty was inspired in a very material fashion by the plaintiff\u2019s resolute insistence of non\u2011interference with the opportunity for profit in the Peterborough branch and that, of course, was to the pecuniary advantage of the agents as well as the plaintiff. It was argued that these defendants coming to the Peterborough branch territory with the purpose of retaining in the organization the agents then on staff, could have carried out that purpose by assuring the staff proper co-operation of head office and the appointment of a new manager who would work for the interest of the company and of those agents. This argument, however, is not convincing. As I say, it was the loyalty of the agents to the manager who had just resigned which was the matter of prime importance and unless that loyalty were broken it would seem of little use to make rosy prophesies of what his successor would do.\nI am, in summary, of the view that the alleged slanders were all uttered on occasions of qualified privilege. However, it would seem that the Court of Appeal were, with respect, correct in their view that there was both extrinsic and intrinsic evidence of malice.\n\u201cMalice\u201d of course does not necessarily mean personal spite or ill-will; it may consist of some indirect motive not connected with the privilege: Jerome v. Anderson[7], per Cartwright J. at p. 299; Dickson v. Wilton (Earl)[8], per Lord Campbell at p. 427.\nFirstly, it must be determined what evidence of malice is sufficient to go to the jury. Whether the defendant was actuated by malice is, of course, a question of fact for the jury but whether there is any evidence of malice fit to be left to the jury is a question of law for the judge to determine: Gatley, op. cit. p. 272; Adam v. Ward, supra, per Lord Finlay L.C. at p. 318.\nRoach J.A. in Taylor et al. v. Despard et al.[9], at p. 978 said:\nThe law is well settled that in order to enable a plaintiff to have the question of malice submitted to the jury\u2014and I am of course dealing only with occasions of qualified privilege\u2014it is necessary that the evidence should raise a probability of malice and be more consistent with its existence than with its non-existence and that there must be more than a mere scintilla of evidence.\nThis would seem to be supported by other authorities. In Turner v. M-G-M Pictures, Ltd.[10], Lord Oaksey said at p. 470:\nDid the appellant prove that it was more probable than not that the respondents were actuated by malice?\nAnd Lord Porter said at p. 455:\nNo doubt, the evidence must be more consistent with malice than with an honest mind, but this does not mean that all the evidence adduced of malice towards the plaintiff on the part of the defendant must be set against such evidence of a favourable attitude towards him as has been given and the question left to, or withdrawn from, the jury by ascertaining which way the scale is tipped when they are weighed in the balance one against the other. On the contrary, each piece of evidence must be regarded separately, and, even if there are a number of instances where a favourable attitude is shown, one case tending to establish malice would be sufficient evidence on which a jury could find for the plaintiff.\nAlthough upon an occasion held to be one of qualified privilege the court will not look too narrowly on the language used in the alleged slander, Spill v. Maule[11]; Adam v. Ward, supra, at p. 334; Taylor et al. v. Despard, et al., supra, the slander if utterly beyond and disproportionate to the facts may provide evidence of excess malice: Spill v. Maule, supra, p. 236.\nMoreover, as Lord Porter pointed out in the judgment quoted and adopted by Cartwright J. in Jerome v. Anderson, supra, at p. 299, one piece of evidence tending to establish malice is sufficient evidence on which a jury could find for the plaintiff and therefore if more than a mere scintilla, it should be submitted to the jury for its finding of fact.\nExpress malice must be found against each one of the three defendants: Egger v. Viscount Chelmsford et al.[12], per Lord Denning M.R., at p. 412:\nIt is a mistake to suppose that, on a joint publication, the malice of one defendant infects his co-defendant. Each defendant is answerable severally, as well as jointly, for the joint publication: and each is entitled to his several defence, whether he be sued jointly or separately from the others. If the plaintiff seeks to rely on malice to aggravate damages, or to rebut a defence of qualified privilege, or to cause a comment, otherwise fair, to become unfair, then he must prove malice against each person whom he charges with it. A defendant is only affected by express malice if he himself was actuated by it: or if his servant or agent concerned in the publication was actuated by malice in the course of his employment.\nOf course, the express malice which actuated any of the three individual defendants will make the corporate defendant liable since the statement was made by the employee in the course of his employer\u2019s business. The Court of Appeal for Ontario in its judgment said, in part:\nBecause as a result of this unanimous view, there must, in the opinion of this Court, be a new trial, we refrain from more specific comment on the evidence so that the matter may in fairness to both parties be left at large for disposition in the new trial.\nI have come to the conclusion, with respect, that such a course is a proper one under the circumstances and, therefore, I shall only state that I am convinced that there is both extrinsic and intrinsic evidence of express malice on the part of each of the three individual defendants. In coming to this conclusion, I have not considered the many references to what would seem to be minor matters indicating express malice such as a certain occurrence during the course of the trial. The trial seems to have been a rather acrimonious contest between counsel and if the evidence of express malice were limited to such slight matters it might well be said that there was only a scintilla of evidence. I have preferred to rely on items of evidence which are not of such limited character having considered them in the manner outlined by Lord Porter, supra, and as approved by Cartwright J. in this Court in Jerome v. Anderson, supra, at p. 300.\nFor these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, JUDSON J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the defendants, appellants: Kimber & Dubin, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: Starr, Allen & Weekes, Toronto.\n[1] [1954] S.C.R. 538.\n[2] [1917] A.C. 309.\n[3] [1956] O.R. 963.\n[4] (1834), 1 Cr.

While his appeal was pending he was served in May 1962 with an application asking the Court to impose a sentence of preventive detention \u201cin addition to\u201d the sentence imposed on the ground that he was a habitual criminal. His appeal on the substantive offence was dismissed and this Court refused to grant leave to appeal in October 1962. In December 1962, the Crown\u2019s request to have the application for preventive detention traversed to the next Court of competent jurisdiction was granted. Because of lack of accommodation at the Court house, the application was not heard until June 1963 despite repeated efforts of Crown counsel to have it heard sooner. The application was quashed by a judge of the County Court Judges\u2019 Criminal Court on the grounds that the notice was defective to the extent of nullity and that the application had expired when it was not dealt with in January. The Court of Appeal held that the application could be amended and that the County Court Judges\u2019 Criminal Court was a continuing Court and adjournments from time to time were not necessary to keep the application alive. The application was ordered remitted to a judge of the County Court Judges\u2019 Criminal Court. The accused was granted leave to appeal to this Court.\nHeld (Cartwright J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Taschereau C.J. and Fauteux, Judson and Spence JJ.: Section 660(1) of the Criminal Code, as amended by 1960-61 (Can.), c. 43, s. 33(1), leaves no room for doubt that the only sentence of preventive detention which could be imposed is \u201cin lieu of\u201d any other sentence, not \u201cin addition to\u201d. The essence of the notice is that a sentence of preventive detention would be sought. This could only be under the existing law. The error in the notice was contained in something that was superfluous. The nullity was to be found in the error and not in the essential function of the notice. There was no need to amend the notice. The contention that the notice was given under a repealed section of the Code could not be accepted. The application had not come to an end because of repeated postponements and delay. The delays were justified in this case. The County Court Judges\u2019 Criminal Court is a continuing Court before which the application was pending until it was heard.\nThe fact that an accused may have unsuccessfully appealed against the sentence imposed upon him for a substantive offence could not operate as a bar to proceeding against him as a habitual criminal.\nAlthough the Court of Appeal had power under s. 667(2) (b) of the Code to impose a sentence of preventive detention, it could not take such action because the application had not been heard. It could, in these circumstances, only say that the quashing of the notice was erroneous.\nPer Cartwright J., dissenting: The notice served upon the appellant was fatally defective. The argument that the notice was sufficient and that the words \u201cin addition to\u201d were mere surplusage, could not be accepted. A notice that the Court will be asked to do something which is clearly illegal and beyond its powers could not form a valid foundation for a criminal proceeding of the most serious sort, in which it is sought to deprive a man of his liberty for the rest of his life. The amendment ordered by the Court of Appeal was ineffective as it was not made until long after the period of three months fixed by the s. 662 had expired. It has long been the settled policy of English criminal law that as against a prisoner every rule in his favour must be observed.\nDroit criminel\u2014Repris de justice\u2014Avis de demande pour imposer \u00e0 l\u2019accus\u00e9 une sentence de d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive \u00aben plus de\u00bb la sentence impos\u00e9e pour l\u2019offense originale\u2014L\u2019avis \u00e9tait-il d\u00e9fectueux jusqu\u2019au point de nullit\u00e9\u2014Code criminel, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, arts. 660(1), 662(1)(a), 667.\nDroit criminel\u2014Repris de justice\u2014Proc\u00e9dure\u2014County Court Judges\u2019 Criminal Court\u2014Demande pour imposer une sentence de d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive\u2014Demande remise \u00e0 la session suivante de la Cour en janvier\u2014Demande finalement entendue en juin\u2014Aucun ajournement durant cette p\u00e9riode\u2014Est-ce que les proc\u00e9dures avaient pris fin \u00e0 cause de ces retards et d\u00e9lais\u2014Est-ce que la County Court Judges\u2019 Criminal Court est une Cour continuelle.\nL\u2019appelant fut trouv\u00e9 coupable en f\u00e9vrier 1962 d\u2019avoir fait le trafic de stup\u00e9fiants et a \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 dix ans d\u2019emprisonnement. Alors que son appel \u00e9tait devant la Cour d\u2019Appel, il re\u00e7ut signification en mai 1962 d\u2019une demande demandant \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019imposer une sentence de d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive \u00aben plus de\u00bb la sentence d\u00e9j\u00e0 impos\u00e9e pour le motif qu\u2019il \u00e9tait un repris de justice. Son appel contre le verdict pour l\u2019offense originale fut rejet\u00e9 et cette Cour refusa permission d\u2019appeler en octobre 1962. La Couronne fit application en d\u00e9cembre 1962 pour remettre la demande de d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive \u00e0 la prochaine Cour de juridiction comp\u00e9tente. Cette demande fut accord\u00e9e. D\u00fb \u00e0 un manque d\u2019am\u00e9nagement au palais de justice, la demande ne fut pas entendue avant le 6 de juin 1963 malgr\u00e9 les efforts du procureur de la Couronne pour qu\u2019elle soit entendue plus t\u00f4t. La demande fut rejet\u00e9e par le juge de la County Court Judges\u2019 Criminal Court pour le motif que l\u2019avis \u00e9tait d\u00e9fectueux jusqu\u2019au point de nullit\u00e9 et que la demande avait expir\u00e9 lorsqu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 entendue au mois de janvier. La Cour d\u2019Appel jugea que la demande pouvait \u00eatre amend\u00e9e et que la County Court Judges\u2019 Criminal Court \u00e9tait une Cour continuelle et que des ajournements de temps \u00e0 autre n\u2019\u00e9taient pas n\u00e9cessaires pour que la demande demeure active. Il fut alors ordonn\u00e9 que la demande soit retourn\u00e9e \u00e0 un juge de la County Court Judges\u2019 Criminal Court. L\u2019appelant obtint permission d\u2019appeler devant cette Cour.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9, le Juge Cartwright \u00e9tant dissident.\nLe Juge en Chef Taschereau et les Juges Fauteux, Judson et Spence: L\u2019article 660(1) du Code criminel, tel qu\u2019amend\u00e9 par 1960-61 (Can.), c. 43, art. 33(1), ne laisse aucun doute que la seule sentence de d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive qui peut \u00eatre impos\u00e9e est une \u00abau lieu de\u00bb toute autre sentence, et non \u00aben plus de\u00bb. Qu\u2019une sentence de d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive serait recherch\u00e9e, telle \u00e9tait la qualit\u00e9 substantielle de l\u2019avis. Ceci ne pouvait avoir lieu que sous le r\u00e9gime de la loi alors existante. L\u2019erreur dans l\u2019avis \u00e9tait contenue dans quelque chose qui \u00e9tait superflu. La nullit\u00e9 portait sur l\u2019erreur et non sur la fonction essentielle de l\u2019avis. L\u2019avis n\u2019avait pas besoin d\u2019\u00eatre amend\u00e9. La proposition que l\u2019avis avait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 sous un article du Code abrog\u00e9 ne peut pas \u00eatre accept\u00e9e.\nLes retards et d\u00e9lais n\u2019avaient pas mis fin \u00e0 la demande; les d\u00e9lais \u00e9taient justifi\u00e9s dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. La County Court Judges\u2019 Criminal Court est une Cour continuelle devant laquelle la demande \u00e9tait en souffrance jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019elle soit entendue. Le fait que l\u2019accus\u00e9 pouvait avoir appel\u00e9 sans succ\u00e8s de la sentence impos\u00e9e pour l\u2019offense originale ne pouvait servir en fin de non-recevoir contre la poursuite prise contre lui comme repris de justice.\nQuoique la Cour d\u2019Appel avait le pouvoir en vertu de l\u2019art. 667(2) (b) du Code d\u2019imposer une sentence de d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive, elle ne pouvait le faire parce que la demande n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 entendue. Tout ce que la Cour pouvait faire, dans les circonstances, \u00e9tait de d\u00e9clarer que le rejet de l\u2019avis \u00e9tait erron\u00e9.\nLe Juge Cartwright, dissident: L\u2019avis qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait fatalement d\u00e9fectueux. L\u2019argument que l\u2019avis \u00e9tait suffisant et que les mots \u00aben plus de\u00bb \u00e9taient simplement du surplus, ne peut pas \u00eatre accept\u00e9. Un avis que la Cour sera requise de faire quelque chose qui est clairement ill\u00e9gal et au-del\u00e0 de ses pouvoirs ne peut pas former un fondement valide pour une poursuite criminelle de la plus s\u00e9rieuse nature, dans laquelle on cherche \u00e0 supprimer la libert\u00e9 d\u2019un homme pour le reste de sa vie. L\u2019amendement ordonn\u00e9 par la Cour d\u2019Appel est inefficace parce qu\u2019il n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait que longtemps apr\u00e8s l\u2019expiration de la p\u00e9riode de trois mois fix\u00e9e par l\u2019art. 662. Dans le droit criminel anglais la ligne de conduite qui est \u00e9tablie depuis longtemps est \u00e0 l\u2019effet que toutes les r\u00e8gles en faveur du prisonnier doivent \u00eatre observ\u00e9es.\nAPPEL d\u2019un jugement de la Cour d\u2019Appel de l\u2019Ontario, renversant une d\u00e9cision du Juge de comt\u00e9 Rogers qui avait rejet\u00e9 une demande pour sentence de d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive sous l\u2019art. 660 du Code criminel. Appel rejet\u00e9, le Juge Cartwright \u00e9tant dissident. APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], reversing an order of Rogers, Co. Ct. J., quashing an application for sentence of preventive detention under s. 660 of the Criminal Code. Appeal dismissed, Cartwright J. dissenting.\nMiss Vera L. Parsons, Q.C., for the appellant.\nD.H. Christie, Q.C., and J.H. Buntain, for the respondent.\nThe judgement of Taschereau C.J. and Fauteux, Judson and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014After the accused had been found guilty of trafficking in drugs contrary to s. 4(3) (a) of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 201, the Crown took proceedings against him as an habitual criminal. This application was quashed by a Judge of the County Court Judges\u2019 Criminal Court for the County of York for two reasons: first, that the notice was defective to the extent of nullity, and second, that the proceedings had come to an end because of delay. On appeal to the Court of Appeal1 both these reasons were rejected and the matter was remitted to a Judge of the same Court for enquiry and disposal. Leave to appeal was granted to this Court. In my opinion the appeal fails.\nThe grounds of appeal make it necessary to set out in some detail the proceedings that were taken against the accused. He was convicted on February 14, 1962, on the charge of trafficking and sentenced to ten years\u2019 imprisonment. His appeal against conviction and sentence was heard and dismissed on June 20, 1962. An application for leave to appeal to this Court was dismissed on October 2, 1962. This ended the proceedings for the offence itself.\nIn the meantime, on May 8, 1962, the Crown served the appellant with notice of intention to seek a sentence of preventive detention against him as an habitual criminal. On June 5, 1963, the appellant filed a notice of motion to quash the application. It was this motion which was granted on June 20, 1963.\nOn July 17, 1963, the Crown prepared a notice of appeal to the Ontario Court of Appeal from the order quashing the application. Time for service of this notice was extended by ex parte order made by Mr. Justice Hughes on July 24, 1963. It was served and filed on July 25, 1963. This appeal was heard in February, 1964, and judgment was given in March, 1964, referring the matter back to the County Court Judges\u2019 Criminal Court. Leave to appeal was granted to this Court in April 1964.\nThe main ground of appeal is that the notice of application, dated May 8, 1962, to have the appellant declared an habitual criminal, was a nullity because it asked for a sentence of preventive detention in addition to the sentence of 10 years. By s. 660(1) of the Criminal Code, enacted by 1960-61 (Can.), c. 43, s. 33(1), the only sentence of preventive detention which could be imposed in the circumstances of this case was one in lieu of the sentence that had been imposed. The statute leaves no room for doubt on this point. It reads:\n660. (1) Where an accused has been convicted of an indictable offence the court may, upon application, impose a sentence of preventive detention in lieu of any other sentence that might be imposed for the offence of which he was convicted or that was imposed for such offence, or in addition to any sentence that was imposed for such offence if the sentence has expired, if\n(a) the accused is found to be an habitual criminal, and\n(b) the court is of the opinion that because the accused is an habitual criminal, it is expedient for the protection of the public to sentence him to preventive detention.\nThe former law embodied in the 1953-1954 statute was that the sentence of preventive detention would be\u2019 in addition to any sentence that had been imposed. From this it is argued that the notice of application was given under a repealed statute and was therefore a nullity.\nI agree with the Court of Appeal that the essence of the notice is that a sentence of preventive detention will be sought. This could only be under the existing law. The error in the notice is contained in something that is superfluous. The nullity is to be found in the error not in the essential function of the notice. I do not think there was any need to amend by substituting \u201cin lieu of\u201d for \u201cin addition to\u201d.\nThese proceedings were authorized by the Attorney General in these terms:\nPursuant to section 662(1) (a)(1) of the Criminal Code, I consent to an application being made to have a sentence of preventive detention imposed upon Douglas Gordon. The consent itself is attacked on the ground that it cannot be applicable to a notice given under a repealed section of the Criminal Code. This objection presupposes the correctness of the first submission. What the Attorney General was consenting to was an application under the Code as it stood at the date of the consent.\nAll that the Crown\u2019s notice needed to say was that a sentence of preventive detention would be sought against the appellant. The Code would then have spoken. The appellant\u2019s sentence had not expired. Therefore, the sentence of preventive detention could only be imposed in lieu of the 10 year sentence that he was already serving. There could be no ambiguity or doubt about the situation. The words \u201cin addition to the sentence of 10 years\u201d which appear in the notice are, on the face of them, erroneous. But this does not mean that the Crown was seeking this sentence under the provisions of a repealed section of the Code or that the notice was given pursuant to a repealed section.\nThe other ground on which the application was quashed in the County Court Judges\u2019 Criminal Court was that because of the repeated postponements and delay, the application, even if it were ever a valid one, had come to an end.\nFirst of all, nothing could be done with this application until this Court had dismissed on October 2, 1962, the application for leave to appeal from the original conviction. The notice had been served on May 8, 1962. On December 10, 1962, counsel for the Attorney General of Canada asked that the application for preventive detention be traversed to the next Court of competent jurisdiction. This request was granted, counsel for the accused neither objecting nor consenting. Because of lack of accommodation at the Courthouse, the application was not heard in the spring of 1963 despite repeated efforts of Crown counsel to have it heard. It finally came on on June 20, 1963, when it was quashed. The second of the reasons given by the learned trial judge was that he was deprived of jurisdiction because the matter had not been dealt with by the County Court Judges\u2019 Criminal Court for the County of York in January, 1963, and that consequently, the application had expired. I agree with the Court of Appeal that the County Court Judges\u2019 Criminal Court is a continuing Court before which this application was pending until it was heard and that any reference to this Court in an unofficial guide as holding weekly sittings does not affect the question.\nUp to this point I have dealt with the first four grounds on which leave to appeal was sought. The fifth ground is that there could not be an application for preventive detention because the original conviction and sentence had been appealed to the Court of Appeal and confirmed by that Court. Therefore, no County Court Judge sitting in the County Court Judges\u2019 Criminal Court could do anything which would in any way modify what the Court of Appeal had done. This argument is contrary to the express provisions of s. 660. The fact that an accused may have unsuccessfully appealed against the sentence imposed upon him for the substantive offence cannot operate as a bar to proceeding against him as an habitual criminal.\nThe sixth ground of appeal has to do with the powers of the Court of Appeal under Part XXI dealing with preventive detention. Section 667 provides:\n667. (1) A person who is sentenced to preventive detention under this Part may appeal to the court of appeal against that sentence on any ground of law or fact or mixed law and fact.\n(2) The Attorney General may appeal to the court of appeal against the dismissal of an application for an order under this Part on any ground of law.\n(2a) On an appeal against a sentence of preventive detention the court of appeal may\n(a) quash such sentence and impose any sentence that might have been imposed in respect of the offence for which the appellant was convicted, or\n(b) dismiss the appeal.\n(2b) On an appeal against the dismissal of an application for an order under this Part the court of appeal may\n(a) allow the appeal, set aside any sentence imposed in respect of the offence for which the respondent was convicted and impose a sentence of preventive detention, or\n(b) dismiss the appeal.\nIn this case the County Court Judge quashed the notice of application. He took no evidence and did not embark upon any enquiry under s. 660. The Court of Appeal, although it has power under s. 667(2) (b) to impose a sentence of preventive detention, could not take any such action because the case had not been heard. It could, in the circumstances, only say that the quashing of the notice was erroneous. The consequence was that there was still an application pending before the County Court Judges\u2019 Criminal Court. The order of the Court of Appeal simply \u00ab tells this Court to proceed with the hearing.\nThe remaining grounds of appeal are concerned with technicalities. They were fully argued and I repeat them merely for the purpose of stating that I have considered and rejected them as having no merit. The remission of the matter to the County Court does not result in a new application which is out of time under s. 662(1)(a)(ii). The notice of application signed by the Special Crown Prosecutor was in order. It was addressed to the appellant and its validity is not affected by the fact that it is not headed \u201cHer Majesty The Queen, Applicant and Douglas Gordon, Respondent.\u201d Mr. Justice Hughes had jurisdiction to make the order of July 24, 1963, extending the time for service of the notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nCARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):\u2014This appeal is brought, pursuant to leave granted by this Court, from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[2] which allowed an appeal by the Attorney General of Canada from an order of His Honour Judge Rogers quashing an application for the imposition of a sentence of preventive detention upon the present appellant. The Court of Appeal ordered that the notice which had been served upon the appellant be amended and that the application for the imposition of a sentence of preventive detention be remitted to a Judge of the County Court Judges Criminal Court of the County of York for inquiry and disposal.\nThere is no dispute as to the facts which are relevant to the determination of this appeal.\nThe appellant was convicted at Toronto on February 14, 1962, before His Honour Judge Forsyth and a jury on a charge of trafficking in drugs contrary to s. 4(3) (a) of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 201. On February 16, 1962, he was sentenced to 10 years\u2019 imprisonment. By Notice of Appeal dated March 7, 1962, he appealed against his conviction and sentence to the Court of Appeal. This appeal was heard and dismissed on June 20, 1962. An application for leave to appeal to this Court was dismissed on October 2, 1962.\nOn May 8, 1962, the appellant was served with a notice of intention to ask that a sentence of preventive detention be imposed upon him on the ground that he is a habitual criminal. On June 5, 1963, the appellant filed a notice of motion to quash the application. This motion was allowed by His Honour Judge Rogers on June 20, 1963.\nOn July 17, 1963, the Attorney General for Canada prepared a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal from the order of His Honour Judge Rogers. On July 24, 1963, Hughes J., on an ex parte application, extended the time for serving and filing the notice until July 29, 1963. The notice was served and filed on July 25, 1963. The appeal came on for hearing before the Court of Appeal on February 24 and 25, 1964. Judgment was reserved until March 10, 1964, when the appeal was allowed. Leave to appeal to this Court was granted pursuant to s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act, on April 28, 1964.\nA number of grounds in support of the appeal to this Court were fully argued but I find it necessary to deal with only one of them, which is that the notice, dated May 8, 1962, served upon the appellant was fatally defective.\nThe notice, dated and served May 8, 1962, recited the conviction of the appellant before His Honour Judge Forsyth, his sentence to ten years\u2019 imprisonment and the giving of consent by the Attorney General of Ontario to the making of the application for the imposition of a sentence of preventive detention and continued:\nTAKE NOTICE, THEREFORE, that having been convicted on the aforesaid charge under Section 4(3) (a) of The Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, Revised Statutes of Canada 1952, Chapter 201 and amendments thereto, of unlawfully trafficking in a drug, to wit Diacetylmorphine, that an application will be made on June 11, 1962, before the Presiding Judge in the County Court Judge\u2019s Criminal Court for the County of York, at the City Hall, Toronto, at 10.00 o\u2019clock in the forenoon to impose upon you a sentence of preventive detention, in addition to the sentence of ten years imposed by His Honour Judge Forsyth on February 16, 1962, on the ground that you are an habitual criminal and that because you are an habitual criminal it is expedient for the protection of the public to sentence you to such preventive detention. The relevant provisions of the Criminal Code conferring jurisdiction on the County Court Judge to hear and determine the application and prescribing the procedure to be followed are s.660(1) and s.662(1) (a). These read as follows:\n660(1) Where an accused has been convicted of an indictable offence the court may, upon application, impose a sentence of preventive detention in lieu of any other sentence that might be imposed for the offence of which he was convicted or that was imposed for such offence, or in addition to any sentence that was imposed for such offence if the sentence has expired, if\n(a) the accused is found to be an habitual criminal, and\n(b) the court is of the opinion that because the accused is an habitual criminal, it is expedient for the protection of the public to sentence him to preventive detention.\n662(1) The following provisions apply with respect to applications under this Part, namely,\n(a) an application under subsection (1) of section 660 shall not be heard unless\n(i) the Attorney General of the province in which the accused is to be tried consents,\n(ii) seven clear days\u2019 notice has been given to the accused by the prosecutor, either before or after conviction or sentence but within three months after the passing of sentence and before the sentence has expired, specifying the previous convictions and the other circumstances, if any, upon which it is intended to found the application, and\n(iii) a copy of the notice has been filed with the clerk of the court or the magistrate, as the case may be;\nSection 660(1) in its present form was enacted by Statutes of Canada 1960-1961, c.43 and came into force on September 1, 1961. Prior thereto that part of the subsection preceding paragraph (a) had read as follows:\n660(1) Where an accused is convicted of an indictable offence the court may, upon application, impose a sentence of preventive detention in addition to any sentence that is imposed for the offence of which he is convicted if\nThe amendment made in 1961 brought about a substantial change in the law. Prior thereto a sentence of preventive detention commenced immediately upon the determination of the sentence imposed for the substantive offence; since the amendment it takes the place of the last mentioned sentence.\nIt appears therefore that the notice served upon the appellant stated that the Judge before whom the application would come was to be asked to do something which he had no power to do and which was contrary to law. It is argued for the appellant that this is a defect in substance and is fatal to the Attorney General\u2019s application.\nIt is clear from the wording of s. 662(1) (a), quoted above, that the giving of a sufficient notice within three months after the passing of sentence is a condition precedent to the hearing of the application. This is not disputed; but counsel for the respondent argues that the notice given was sufficient and that the words \u201cin addition to the sentence of ten years imposed by His Honour Judge Forsyth on February 16, 1962\u201d can and should be regarded as mere surplusage. This argument found favour with the Court of Appeal but I am unable to accept it.\nThe question is whether the notice, when it was served, constituted a sufficient compliance with the statutory condition precedent prescribed by s. 662. If it did not the amendment ordered by the Court of Appeal would be ineffective as it was not made until long after the period of three months fixed by the section had expired.\nNo special form of notice is required by the section but I have reached the conclusion that a notice that the Court will be asked to do that which is clearly illegal and beyond its powers cannot form a valid foundation for a criminal proceeding of the most serious sort, in which it is sought to deprive a man of his liberty for the rest of his life.\nIt is said, on behalf of the respondent, that no real prejudice has been caused to the appellant but it has long been the settled policy of English criminal law that as against the prisoner every rule in his favour is observed.\nIn R. v. Triffitt[3], the Court of Criminal Appeal quashed a finding that the appellant was a habitual criminal because of an irregularity of procedure although, in the words of Humphreys J. who gave the unanimous judgment of the Court, \u201cthe appeal has otherwise no merits whatsoever\u201d.\nIn Parkes v. The Queen[4], this Court set aside a finding that the appellant was a habitual criminal. At pages 773 and 774, Rand J. said:\nThere seems to be a tendency to treat a proceeding under the section as one in which strict compliance with the express requirements of the Code is not to be insisted on. That is altogether a mistake. Under such a determination a person can be detained in prison for the rest of his life with his liberty dependent on the favourable discretion of a minister of the Crown. The adjudication is a most serious step in the administration of the criminal law in relation to which it is well to recall the words of the Lord Chief Justice of England in Martin v. Mackonochie (1878) 3 Q.B.D. 730 at 775-6.\nIt seems to me, I must say, a strange argument in a court of justice, to say that when, as the law stands, formal proceedings are in strict law required, yet if no substantial injustice has been done by dealing summarily with a defendant, the proceeding should be upheld. In a court of law such an argument \u00e0 convenienti is surely inadmissible. In a criminal proceeding the question is not alone whether substantial justice has been done, but whether justice has been done according to law. All proceedings in poenam are it need scarcely be observed, strictissimi juris; nor should it be forgotten that the formalities of law, though here and there they may lead to the escape of an offender, are intended on the whole to insure the safe administration of justice and the protection of innocence, and must be observed. A party accused has the right to insist upon them as a matter of right, of which he cannot be deprived against his will; and the judge must see that they are followed. He cannot set himself above the law which he has to administer, or make or mould it to suit the exigencies of a particular occasion. Though a murderer should be taken red-handed in the act, if there is a flaw in the indictment the criminal must have the benefit of it. If the law is imperfect, it is for the legislature to amend. The judge must administer it as he finds it. And the procedure by which an offender is to be tried, though but ancillary to the application of the substantive law and to the ends of justice, is as much part of the law as the substantive law itself.\nHaving reached the conclusion, for the reasons stated above, that the notice served upon the accused was fatally defective, it becomes unnecessary for me to examine the other grounds in support of the appeal which were argued before us.\nI would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal and restore that of His Honour Judge Rogers quashing the application for the imposition of a sentence of preventive detention.\nAppeal dismissed, CARTWRIGHT J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Graham, Parsons & Liscombe, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the respondent: T.D.

On March 15, 1961, the action was inscribed for proof and hearing and was placed on the roll of ordinary cases to await its turn for hearing. It remained on the roll and in the ordinary course would have come up for hearing in the month of November 1963. Following the inscription, the plaintiff applied for a trial by jury and to have the case entered on the special roll of trials by jury. This application was granted on April 13, 1961. No further proceedings were made and in particular no application to strike a panel of jurors and fix a date for trial. On April 26, 1963, the respondents made a motion for peremption asking that the action be dismissed on the ground that no useful proceeding had been taken within two years. The motion was dismissed by the trial judge, but his judgment was reversed by a majority judgment in the Court of Appeal. The plaintiff appeals to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nWhen an action has been inscribed and is awaiting its turn for hearing, the period required for peremption runs only from the day on which it is struck from the roll. The inscription for proof and hearing filed in March 1961 did not lapse when the application for a trial by jury was made in April 1961. That inscription continued in full force and effect and the delays for peremption would not commence to run until the day the case had been struck from the roll.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec[1], reversing a judgment of Ouimet J. Appeal allowed.\nGilles Godin, Q.C., for the plaintiff, appellant.\nRoger Lacoste, Q.C., for the defendants, respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nABBOTT J.:\u2014Appellant, as tutor to his minor son Alain Filion, sued respondents for the sum of $67,055.59 as damages resulting from the amputation of the right leg of his son, then five years of age, alleging that the amputation was necessitated by reason of the fault and negligence of the respondents.\nThe respondent l'H\u00f4pital Sainte-Justine pleaded to the action and issue was joined between it and the appellant \u00e8s qualit\u00e9. The respondent Raymonde Magnan appeared but did not plead.\nOn March 15, 1961, appellant inscribed the action for proof and hearing on the merits against l'H\u00f4pital Sainte-Justine and for proof and hearing ex parte against Raymonde Magnan. The inscription was filed with the Master of the Rolls of the Superior Court on March 24, 1961, and the action was placed by him on the roll of ordinary cases to await its turn for hearing. It remained on the roll and in the ordinary course would have come up for hearing in the month of November 1963.\nFollowing this inscription appellant made option under arts. 421 et seq. of the Code of Civil Procedure for a trial by jury and applied under art. 423 C.C.P. to have the case entered on the special roll of trials by jury. That application was granted on April 13, 1961. Thereafter appellant took no further proceedings and in particular he did not apply under art. 433 C.C.P. to strike a panel of jurors and fix a date for trial.\nOn April 26, 1963, respondents served on appellant a motion for peremption under art. 282 C.C.P. asking that the action be dismissed on the ground that no useful pro- ceeding had been taken within two years. That motion was dismissed by Ouimet J. but his judgment was reversed by the Court of Queen's Bench[2], Bissonnette and Owen JJ. dissenting, and appellant's action was dismissed with costs. The present appeal is from that judgment.\nThe jurisprudence has established beyond question that when an action has been inscribed and is awaiting its turn for hearing the period required for peremption runs only from the day on which it is struck from the roll. Caron Signs Regd. v. Montreal Tramways Co.[3]; Commercial Acceptance Corporation v. Clark[4].\nThe sole question in issue here therefore is whether the inscription for proof and hearing filed on March 24, 1961, lapsed when in April 1961 appellant made application for a trial by jury. I share the opinion expressed by Bissonnette and Owen JJ. that it did not lapse.\nThe right to a trial by jury in civil matters is an exceptional right and is subject to special formalities. Like any other such right it can be renounced either expressly or tacitly. It may be that in failing to make the application called for under art. 433 C.C.P. appellant lost his right to a trial by jury but I do not find it necessary to express any view as to this.\nIn my opinion however the inscription for proof and hearing before a judge alone filed on March 24, 1961, continued in full force and effect and the delays for peremption would not commence to run until the day the case had been struck from the roll.\nI would allow the appeal and restore the judgment at trial. The appellant is entitled to his costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nAttorneys for the plaintiff, appellant: Chauss\u00e9 & Godin, Montreal.\nAttorneys for the defendants, respondents: Lacoste, Lacoste, Savoie & Laniel, Montreal.\n[1] [1964] Que.

Prior to the date fixed for sentence, an appeal against conviction was taken by way of a new trial to a higher Court. The judge at the trial de novo dismissed the appeal and imposed a sentence. The conviction was quashed by the Court of Appeal on the ground that there was no evidence to sustain the conviction. The Crown was granted leave to appeal to this Court pursuant to s. 41(3) of the Supreme Court Act.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThere was, as found by the Court below, no evidence to support the conviction.

Spector, Q.C., and M. N. Rosenstein, for the appellant.\nG. Beaupr\u00e9 and M. Trudeau, for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nFAUTEUX J.:\u2014In May 1961, respondents were found guilty, under Part XXIV of the Criminal Code, by Judge T. A. Fontaine of the Court of the Sessions of the Peace for the District of Montreal, of having, in Montreal, in violation of the provisions of s.367(a) Cr.C., on or about October 14, 1960,wrongfully and without lawful authority, dismissed from their employment four employees of the respondent company, to wit, Jean-Guy Chastenais, Rom\u00e9o Goulet, Armand Langlois and Jean-Pierre Cyr, for the reason only that they were members of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, a lawful trade union.\nPrior to the date eventually fixed for sentence, respondents appealed from their conviction to the Superior Court pursuant to ss. 719 et seq. Cr. C. Mr. Justice Roger Ouimet, who presided at the trial de novo, dismissed these appeals on November 26, 1962, and, on November 30, 1962, sentenced both respondents.\nRespondents then sought and obtained leave to appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal Side) [3] pursuant to s. 743 Cr.C., on the ground that there was no legal evidence supporting their conviction. The appeal of Cl\u00e9ment Alepin and the appeal of J. Alepin Fr\u00e9res Lt\u00e9e bear respectively No. 1838 and No. 1840 of the records of the latter Court. The Court of Queen's Bench (Hyde, Rinfret and Montgomery JJ.A.) maintained these appeals, quashed the convictions, acquitted the respondents and ordered the complainant, Genevi\u00e8ve Boss\u00e9, to pay each of the respondents one-quarter of the costs of the transcription of the evidence and the preparation of the joint case in appeal.\nAppellant then sought and obtained leave to appeal from these judgments to this Court pursuant to s. 41(3) of the Supreme Court Act, on the ground that the Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal Side) concluded in error that there was no evidence to sustain the convictions.\nAs accurately reviewed in the reasons for judgment of Montgomery J.A., the material facts giving rise to this case can be summarized as follows. At the relevant time, respondent company was manufacturing women's clothing, respondent Cl\u00e9ment Alepin, the company's Secretary-Treasurer, appearing to have been in sole charge of the operations. The work was carried out on two floors of the building, the larger number of employees working on the upper floor and the four above mentioned employees, on the floor below. The company's employees were not organized into a labour union before the Spring of 1960, at about which time the International Ladies Garment Workers Union established a local in the plant and was certified as bargaining agent for the employees. While conciliation and arbitration proceedings, which started in the Fall, were pending, the President of the local, one Mrs. Latour, was dismissed by respondents. This dismissal also lead to other charges against respondents which are the object of a separate appeal to this Court. On the morning following the dismissal of Mrs. Latour, Genevi\u00e8ve Boss\u00e9, working on the upper floor, there tried to force respondent Cl\u00e9ment Alepin to state in front of other employees his reasons for dismissing Mrs. Latour. Upon his refusal to do so, other employees intervened and a noisy demonstration then ensued. Being unable to cope with the situation, the management called the police. Upon arrival, the police, in order to restore the order, enjoined the demonstrators to leave, suggesting to them to go to their union hall. A number of employees, eventually followed by the four above mentioned who had taken no part in the demonstration, then left. Members of the union started to picket the plant that afternoon.\nIn his reasons for judgment, Montgomery J.A., with the concurrence of Hyde J.A., found that it was clear from the evidence of the four employees alleged to have been dismissed that, while they were also enjoined by an unidentified constable to vacate the employers' premises, there was no dismissal, within the meaning of the section, by the management, either directly or indirectly, through instructions it might have given but did not actually give to the police. Rinfret J.A., who wrote separate reasons, fully agreed with these views. At the hearing before us, counsel for the appellant strongly relied on certain statements made by Camille Alepin to some of the employees, during the demonstration. Camille Alepin had been jointly charged of the same offences with the two respondents but was acquitted in first instance by Judge T.A. Fontaine. From that acquittal, there was no appeal.\nHaving considered all that counsel for the appellant had to say, I am unable to find error in the opinion reached in the Court below that there was no evidence to support the convictions of respondents.\nI would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nAttorney for the appellant: J.J.

Alepin Fr\u00e8res Lt\u00e9e and Cl\u00e9ment Alepin Appellants;\nand\nHer Majesty The Queen Respondent.\n(Nos. 1839-1841 C.Q.B.)\n1964: November 27; 1965: January 26.\nPresent: Taschereau C.J. and Fauteux, Abbott, Ritchie and Spence JJ.\nAPPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nLabour\u2014Criminal law\u2014Wrongful dismissal from employment\u2014Appeal by way of trial de novo before sentence imposed\u2014Whether judge hearing trial de novo has jurisdiction to impose sentence\u2014Whether evidence to support conviction\u2014Criminal Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 367(a), 367(b), 719\u2014Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 259, s. 41(1) (3).\nThe respondents were convicted by a judge of the Court of the Sessions of the Peace of having, in violation of s. 367 of the Criminal Code, wrongfully dismissed an employee for the reason only that she was a member of a lawful trade union, and of having sought by intimidation and by causing actual loss of employment to compel other employees to abstain from belonging to a trade union. Prior to the date fixed for sentence, an appeal was taken by way of a new trial to a higher Court. By agreement of the parties, only the report of the original trial was submitted as evidence. The conviction was sustained and a sentence was imposed by the judge hearing the trial de novo. On a further appeal to the Court of Appeal, the conviction was maintained but the sentence was quashed on the ground that the judge at the trial de novo had no jurisdiction to impose a sentence.\nThe Crown was granted leave to appeal to this Court against the finding of the Court of Appeal on the question of jurisdiction to impose a sentence; and the respondents were granted leave to appeal with respect to the conviction.\nHeld: The appeal of the Crown should be quashed and the appeal of the respondents should be dismissed.\nIt is clear from the terms of s. 41(3) of the Supreme Court Act that, unless the judgment sought to be appealed is a judgment \"acquitting or convicting or setting aside or affirming a conviction or acquittal\", there is no jurisdiction in this Court to entertain the appeal. The judgment sought to be appealed here did not come within that description. It was related to sentence. The general proposition that matters which are not mentioned in s. 41(3) must be held to be comprised in s. 41(1) was ruled out in Goldhar v. R., [1960] S.C.R. 60 and Paul v. R., [1960] S.C.R. 452.\nAs to the appeal against conviction, the submission that there was no evidence to support it could not be accepted. The conviction was justified by the evidence. There was also no substance in the submission that the judge at the trial de novo was prejudiced by the reading of the reasons for judgment delivered by the trial judge.\nTravail\u2014Droit criminel\u2014Cong\u00e9diement ill\u00e9gal\u2014Appel par voie de proc\u00e8s de novo avant le prononc\u00e9 de la sentence\u2014Juridiction du juge entendant le proc\u00e8s de novo d'imposer une sentence\u2014Preuve supportant le verdict de culpabilit\u00e9\u2014Code criminel, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, arts. 367(a), 367(b), 719\u2014Loi sur la Cour supr\u00eame, S.R.C. 1952, c. 259, s. 41(1), (3).\nLes intim\u00e9s furent trouv\u00e9s coupables par un juge de la Cour des Sessions de la Paix d'avoir, en violation de l'art. 367 du Code criminel, cong\u00e9di\u00e9 ill\u00e9galement une employ\u00e9e pour la seule raison qu'elle \u00e9tait membre d'un syndicat ouvrier l\u00e9gitime, et aussi d'avoir cherch\u00e9 par l'intimidation et en causant la perte r\u00e9elle d'un emploi \u00e0 contraindre d'autres employ\u00e9s de s'abstenir d'\u00eatre membres d'un syndicat ouvrier. Avant la date fix\u00e9e pour le prononc\u00e9 de la sentence, les intim\u00e9s en appel\u00e8rent de ce verdict devant un juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure par voie de proc\u00e8s nouveau. Par une entente entre les parties, seul le dossier du proc\u00e8s original fut soumis comme preuve. Le verdict de culpabilit\u00e9 fut maintenu et le juge au proc\u00e8s de novo imposa une sentence. En appel devant la Cour d'Appel, le verdict de culpabilit\u00e9 fut maintenu mais la sentence fut mise de c\u00f4t\u00e9 pour le motif que le juge au proc\u00e8s de novo n'avait pas juridiction pour imposer une sentence.\nLa Couronne a obtenu permission d'en appeler devant cette Cour du jugement de la Cour d'Appel sur la question de juridiction pour imposer la sentence; et les intim\u00e9s ont obtenu permission d'en appeler du verdict de culpabilit\u00e9.\nArr\u00eat: L'appel de la Couronne doit \u00eatre cass\u00e9 et l'appel des intim\u00e9s doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9.\nIl est clair de par les termes de l'art. 41(3) de la Loi sur la Cour supr\u00eame qu'\u00e0 moins que le jugement en appel ne soit un jugement \u00abacquittant ou d\u00e9clarant coupable ou annulant ou confirmant une d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 ou un acquittement\u00bb, cette Cour n'a pas juridiction pour entendre l'appel. En l'esp\u00e8ce, le jugement en appel ne tombe pas sous cette description. Il se rapporte \u00e0 la sentence. La proposition que les mati\u00e8res qui ne sont pas mentionn\u00e9es dans l'art. 41(3) doivent \u00eatre comprises dans l'art. 41(1) a \u00e9t\u00e9 mise de c\u00f4t\u00e9 dans Goldhar v. R., [1960] R.C.S. 60 et Paul v. R., [1960] R.C.S. 452.\nPour ce qui est de l'appel contre le verdict de culpabilit\u00e9, la proposition qu'il n'y avait pas de preuve pour le supporter ne peut pas \u00eatre accept\u00e9e. Le verdict \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9 par la preuve. Le grief que le juge au proc\u00e8s de novo a \u00e9t\u00e9 influenc\u00e9 par les notes de jugement du juge au proc\u00e8s initial n'est pas fond\u00e9. APPEL de la Couronne et APPEL des intim\u00e9s du jugement de la Cour du banc de la reine, province de Qu\u00e9bec[1], maintenant le verdict de culpabilit\u00e9 mais cassant la sentence. Appel de la Couronne cass\u00e9 et appel des intim\u00e9s rejet\u00e9.\nAPPEAL by the Crown and APPEAL by the accused from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec[2], maintaining the conviction of the accused but quashing the sentence. Appeal of the Crown quashed and appeal of the accused dismissed.\nJ. J. Spector, Q.C., and M. N. Rosenstein, for the Crown.\nG. Beaupr\u00e9 and M. Trudeau, for the accused.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nFAUTEUX J.:\u2014In May 1961, respondents were found guilty, under Part XXIV of the Criminal Code, by Judge T. A. Fontaine of the Court of the Sessions of the Peace, for the District of Montreal, of having, in Montreal, on or about November 13, 1960, in violation of s.367 Cr.C., (i) dismissed from her employment with respondent company, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Latour, for the reason only that she was a member of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, a lawful trade union, and (ii) sought by intimidation and by causing actual loss of her employment to compel other employees of the company to abstain from belonging to a trade union to which they had a lawful right to belong. Jointly charged of the same offences, Camille Alepin was acquitted.\nPrior to the date eventually fixed for sentence, respondents appealed from their conviction to the Superior Court pursuant to ss. 719 et seq. Cr.C.; in the result, no sentence was pronounced by Judge Fontaine. The evidence submitted at the trial de novo was, by agreement of the parties through their respective counsel, the evidence adduced in the Court of Sessions of the Peace before Judge Fontaine. This appeal was heard by Ouimet J. who, having considered the matter, dismissed it in November 1962 and, a few days later, imposed sentence on each of the respondents.\nThe latter then sought and obtained leave to enter a separate appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench[3] from the conviction as well as from the sentence. As grounds of appeal against the conviction, they contended that there was no evidence in support thereof and also that Ouimet J. had illegally read and been prejudiced by the reading of the reasons for judgment delivered in the Court of Sessions of the Peace by Judge Fontaine. As grounds of appeal against the sentence, they submitted that, in the circumstances, the jurisdiction to impose sentence was exclusively vested in the Judge of the Court of Sessions of the Peace and not in the Judge of the Superior Court hearing the trial de novo. On these appeals of the company and Cl\u00e9ment Alepin, bearing respectively No. 1841 and No. 1839 of its records, the Court of Appeal (Hyde, Rinfret and Montgomery JJ. A.) rendered the following formal judgment:\nDOTH MAINTAIN THE APPEAL to the extent of quashing the order for the payment of costs by the Appellant and the sentence imposed upon him by the Superior Court (Hyde, J. dissenting as to the quashing of the sentence), DOTH order that the record be referred back to the Court of Sessions of the Peace for the District of Montreal for the imposition of sentence, and DOTH otherwise dismiss the appeal without costs (Rinfret, J. dissenting, would quash the conviction and return the record to the Superior Court).\n(SIGNED)\nG. MILLER HYDE\nG.-ED. RINFRET\nG. H. MONTGOMERY\nJJ. Q.B.\nThus in each of the appeals:\u2014(i) the conviction was maintained by a majority judgment (Hyde and Montgomery JJ.A.); Rinfret J.A., dissenting on the basis of the second ground of appeal, would have quashed the conviction and returned the record to the Superior Court for a fresh trial de novo; (ii) the sentence was quashed by a majority judgment, Rinfret J.A. because he would have quashed the conviction and Montgomery J.A. for the reason that, in his view, the ground raised as to jurisdiction to impose sentence, was well founded. Hyde J.A., dissenting, would have maintained the sentence. In each of the appeals, the Court ordered the record to be referred back to the Court of Sessions of the Peace for the District of Montreal for the imposition of sentence.\nHence, two appeals were launched in this Court with leave thereof granted under s.41 of the Supreme Court Act, to wit (i) the appeal of Her Majesty the Queen against the finding of the Court of Appeal on the question of jurisdiction to impose sentence and (ii) the appeal of J. Alepin Fr\u00e8res Lt\u00e9e and Cl\u00e9ment Alepin, with respect to the conviction.\nThe recital of the material facts giving rise to these proceedings appears in my reasons for judgment delivered this day in the case of Her Majesty the Queen v. J. Alepin Fr\u00e8res Lt\u00e9e and Cl\u00e9ment Alepin, Nos. 1838-1840 C.Q.B.[4].\nWith respect to the appeal of Her Majesty the Queen, I have reached the opinion that this Court has no jurisdiction. Any jurisdiction this Court might have must be found in s.41 of the Supreme Court Act, there being, in the Criminal Code, no provisions permitting, in summary convictions, an appeal to this Court. The relevant provisions of s.41 to be considered are:\n41. (1) Subject to subsection (3), an appeal lies to the Supreme Court with leave of that Court from any final or other judgment of the highest court of final resort in a province, or a judge thereof, in which judgment can be had in the particular case sought to be appealed to the Supreme Court, whether or not leave to appeal to the Supreme Court has been refused by any other court.\n41. (3) No appeal to the Supreme Court lies under this section from the judgment of any court acquitting or convicting or setting aside or affirming a conviction or acquittal of an indictable offence or, except in respect of a question of law or jurisdiction, of an offence other than an indictable offence.\nIt is clear from the terms of subsection (3) that, unless the judgment sought to be appealed is a judgment \"acquit- ting or convicting or setting aside or affirming a conviction or acquittal\" of either an indictable offence or an offence other than an indictable offence, there is no jurisdiction in this Court under that subsection to entertain this appeal. The judgment here sought to be appealed does not come within that description. It is not a judgment related to an acquittal or a conviction of an offence and, while an important question of jurisdiction is involved therein, this question does not relate to an acquittal or a conviction within the meaning of subsection (3) but to sentence. Neither can jurisdiction of this Court be found in subsection (1). The general proposition that matters which are not mentioned in s.41(3) must be held to be comprised in s.41(1), with the consequence that this Court would have jurisdiction to entertain an appeal from a judgment of a nature similar to the one here considered, is ruled out by what was said by this Court in Goldhar v. The Queen[5] and Paul v. The Queen[6]. It may be a matter of regret that this Court has no jurisdiction to decide the important question which gave rise to conflicting opinions in the Court below, but strong as my views may be with respect to that question, I am clearly of opinion that this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain this appeal.\nAs to the appeal of J. Alepin Fr\u00e8res Lt\u00e9e and Cl\u00e9ment Alepin, two submissions made by counsel for appellants are to be considered. The first one is that there was no evidence that Mrs. Latour was dismissed for the reason only that she was a member of a lawful trade union (s. 367 (a) Cr.C.) or that appellants wrongfully or without lawful authority sought, by intimidation and by causing actual loss of her employment, to compel other employees to abstain from belonging to the International Ladies Garment Workers Union (s. 367 (b) Cr.C.). In none of the three Courts below was this submission accepted and, in my view, rightly so. From the evidence, it is sufficient to point to the following statement made by Alepin to Mrs. Latour, in the afternoon of the 13th of October 1960:\nJe suis oblig\u00e9 de vous renvoyer, cela me fait de la peine; parce que vous \u00eates la pr\u00e9sidente de l'union.\nand to this other statement, also made by Cl\u00e9ment Alepin, to foreman Lebeau, apparently with reference to Mrs. Latour's dismissal:\nQuand on coupe la t\u00eate du chef, le restant, les membres se placent, \u00e7a s'\u00e9croule.\nThe second submission is that Ouimet J., seized with the trial de novo, illegally read and was prejudiced by the reading of the reasons for judgment delivered by Judge Fontaine of the Court of Sessions of the Peace. The judgment of Ouimet J. clearly indicates that, while he expressed his agreement with Judge Fontaine, he did form his own conclusions both as to the facts and the law, after due consideration of the evidence submitted by agreement of the parties as well as the written arguments made by their counsel in support of their respective submissions. With deference, I fail to see any substance in this submission which, as well as the first made in support of this appeal, cannot be accepted.\nI would therefore quash the appeal of Her Majesty the Queen, with costs, and dismiss the appeal of J. Alepin Fr\u00e8res Lt\u00e9e and Cl\u00e9ment Alepin, with costs.\nAppeal by the Crown quashed with costs; and appeal by the respondents dismissed with costs.\nAttorney for the Crown: J. J.

B. Eddy Company, Dominion Engineering Works Limited, John Inglis Company Limited, Spruce Falls Pulp & Paper Company Limited Respondents.\n1964: December 9, 10; 1965: March 1.\nPresent: Abbott, Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Hall JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nTaxation\u2014Customs and Excise\u2014Importation of high\u2014speed newsprint machine\u2014Whether of a class or kind made in Canada\u2014Customs Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 58\u2014Customs Tariff, R.S.C. 1952, c. 60, tariff items 427, 427a.\nThe respondent MacMillan & Bloedel Ltd. imported a 276-inch newsprint machine made in the United States, having a rated mechanical speed of 2,500 feet per minute. The respondent stated its intent to purchase by letter dated January 25, 1955, and became committed to purchase on February 1, 1955. The formal contract was dated August 25, 1955, and the machine was shipped in a knock-down condition between November 1956 and the end of June 1957. The machine was classified by the Port Appraiser as being of a class or kind made in Canada and attracting therefore Tariff Item 427 which provides a much higher rate of duty than if it were classified under Tariff Item 427a as of a class or kind not made in Canada. The classification under Item 427 was upheld by the Tariff Board, but this decision was reversed by the Exchequer Court. The Crown appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nThe time for determining tariff classification is at the time of entry into Canada of the goods, and having regard to the language of s. 43 of the Customs Act, as amended in 1955 by 3-4 Eliz. II, c. 32, there could be no justification for fixing any other date as the date upon which the duty, if any, was to be determined.\nThe contention that there was no evidence of newsprint machines being made in Canada prior to the period from November 1956 to the end of June 1957, was untenable. There was ample evidence to support the findings of fact made by the Tariff Board that newsprint machines had been and were being manufactured in Canada in the relevant period, and no error in law was made in arriving at those findings of fact. The argument that the Tariff Board erred in law in refusing to find that design speed should be the deciding factor in arriving at a conclusion as to whether or not the machine in question was of a class or kind not made in Canada, could not be sustained. The refusal of the Board to accept design speed as the criterion or determinant of class or kind was a finding of fact, and there was ample evidence before the Board to justify that finding. There being no error in law, that finding should not have been disturbed by the Exchequer Court.\nThe contention that the decision of the Tariff Board was invalid on the ground that the Board at the time it made it was not properly constituted, could not be upheld. In the absence of evidence to substantiate the allegation that Mr. Leduc was not a vice-chairman at the time of the rendering of the decision, and in the absence of any suggestion that the Board was not properly constituted at the time of the hearing, it must be presumed that the Board was properly constituted throughout at all relevant times.\nRevenu\u2014Douanes et accise\u2014Importation d'une machine \u00e0 grande vitesse pour fabriquer le papier journal\u2014Est-elle d'une classe ou esp\u00e8ce fabriqu\u00e9e au Canada\u2014Loi sur les douanes, S.R.C. 1952, c. 58\u2014Tarif des douanes, S.R.C. 1952, c. 60, item 427,427a.\nL'intim\u00e9 MacMillan & Bloedel Ltd. importa une machine pour fabriquer le papier journal de 276 pouces faite aux \u00c9tats-Unis et ayant une vitesse normale de 2,500 pieds par minute. L'intim\u00e9 d\u00e9clara son intention d'acheter par lettre en date du 25 janvier 1955 et s'engagea d\u00e9finitivement le premier f\u00e9vrier 1955. Le contrat formel est dat\u00e9 du 25 ao\u00fbt 1955 et la machine fut consign\u00e9e par pi\u00e8ces entre novembre 1956 et la fin de juin 1957. L'appr\u00e9ciateur du port d'entr\u00e9e classifia la machine comme \u00e9tant d'une classe ou esp\u00e8ce fabriqu\u00e9e au Canada et tombant alors sous l'item 427 qui pr\u00e9voit un taux de droits plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 que si elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 classifi\u00e9e sous l'item 427a comme \u00e9tant d'une classe ou esp\u00e8ce non fabriqu\u00e9e au Canada. Cette classification sous l'item 427 fut maintenue par la Commission du tarif, mais cette d\u00e9cision fut renvers\u00e9e par la Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier. La Couronne en appela devant cette Cour.\nArr\u00eat: L'appel doit \u00eatre maintenu.\nLa p\u00e9riode pour d\u00e9terminer la classification tarifaire est au moment de l'entr\u00e9e des marchandises au Canada, et si l'on tient compte du langage de l'art. 43 de la Loi sur les douanes, telle qu'amend\u00e9e en 1955 par 3-4 Eliz. II, c. 32, il n'y a aucune justification pour fixer une autre date comme \u00e9tant celle durant laquelle les droits \u00e0 payer doivent \u00eatre d\u00e9termin\u00e9s.\nLa proposition qu'il n'y avait aucune preuve que des machines pour fabriquer le papier journal \u00e9taient fabriqu\u00e9es au Canada avant la p\u00e9riode entre novembre 1956 et la fin de juin 1957, n'est pas soutenable. Il y avait d'abondantes preuves pour supporter les conclusions de fait de la Commission du tarif que de telles machines avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 et \u00e9taient fabriqu\u00e9es au Canada durant la p\u00e9riode pertinente, et aucune erreur de droit n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite pour arriver \u00e0 ces conclusions de fait.\nL'argument que la Commission du tarif a err\u00e9 en droit en refusant de prendre la vitesse pr\u00e9vue comme \u00e9tant le facteur d\u00e9cisif pour d\u00e9cider la question de savoir si la machine \u00e9tait d'une classe ou esp\u00e8ce non fabriqu\u00e9e au Canada, ne peut pas \u00eatre soutenu. Le refus de la Commission d'accepter la vitesse pr\u00e9vue comme le crit\u00e8re ou d\u00e9terminant de la classe ou esp\u00e8ce \u00e9tait une conclusion de fait, et il y avait d'abondantes preuves devant la Commission pour justifier cette conclusion. Comme il n'y avait aucune erreur en droit, cette conclusion n'aurait pas d\u00fb \u00eatre mise de c\u00f4t\u00e9 par la Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier.\nLa proposition que la d\u00e9cision de la Commission du tarif \u00e9tait invalide pour le motif que la Commission n'\u00e9tait pas validement constitu\u00e9e lorsqu'elle rendit cette d\u00e9cision, ne peut pas \u00eatre maintenue. En l'absence de preuve pour justifier l'all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que monsieur Leduc n'\u00e9tait pas vice-pr\u00e9sident lorsque la d\u00e9cision fut rendue, et en l'absence de toute suggestion que la Commission n'\u00e9tait pas validement constitu\u00e9e lors de l'audition, on doit pr\u00e9sumer que la Commission \u00e9tait validement constitu\u00e9e durant la p\u00e9riode pertinente.\nAPPEL d'un jugement du Juge Dumoulin de la Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier, maintenant un appel de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission du tarif.

Ltd.\nA. Forget, Q.C., for Dominion Engineering Works Ltd.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nHALL J.:\u2014This is an appeal by the Deputy Minister of National Revenue for Customs and Excise from the judgment of the Honourable Mr. Justice Dumoulin of the Ex-chequer Court of Canada dated January 18, 1963, allowing an appeal from a declaration made by the Tariff Board and dated April 29,1959.\nThe appeal relates to a Beloit 276 inch newsprint machine made by Beloit Iron Works of Beloit, Wisconsin, having a rated mechanical speed of 2,500 feet per minute. The respondent MacMillan & Bloedel stated its intent to purchase the newspaper machine from Beloit Iron Works by letter dated January 25, 1955. The said respondent became committed to purchase the newsprint machine on February 1, 1955. The formal contract was dated August 25, 1955. The newsprint machine was shipped to the said respondent in Canada from Beloit Iron Works in a knocked-down condition during the period from November 26, 1956 to June 24, 1957.\nThe Port Appraiser classified the newsprint machine as being of a class or kind made in Canada and applied Tariff Item 427 which provided for a rate of duty of 22 1\/2%. The said respondent requested that the newsprint machine be classified as of a class or kind not made in Canada and that Tariff Item 427a be applied. Tariff Item 427a provides for a rate of duty of 7 1\/2%. The classification of the Port Appraiser was affirmed by the Dominion Customs Appraiser. MacMillan & Bloedel requested the Deputy Minister of National Revenue for Customs and Excise to reconsider the classification made by the Dominion Customs Appraiser. The Deputy Minister on June 14, 1957 affirmed the classification made by the Dominion Customs Appraiser. It is from this decision that the said respondent appealed to the Tariff Board.\nThe appeal to the Exchequer Court from the declaration of the Tariff Board was upon the following ground.\n7. The imported newsprint machine was not of a class or kind made in Canada, and the imported mechanical differential drive was not of a class or kind made in Canada.\n8. The Tariff Board failed to make any positive findings of fact with regard to the classification of newsprint machines for customs purposes or to make a determination as to which classes or kinds of newsprint machines were made in Canada. In the alternative, if the Tariff Board included all newsprint machines in a single class it clearly erred in law in failing to define the class or kind with a reasonable degree of narrowness as required by law.\n9. The imported newsprint machine differed in physical characteristics in capacity and in other respects from machines made in Canada prior to the material time to such a degree that it could not be classified as a machine of a class or kind made in Canada. Only one newsprint machine has been made in Canada at any time which might, in any view of the case, be regarded as similar to the imported machine. Such machine was not made in Canada prior to any time material to these proceedings and in the alternative if it was made in Canada prior to a material time, one newsprint machine could not constitute \"substantial quantities\" within the meaning of section 6 of the said Customs Tariff.\n10. The Tariff Board erred in law in concluding that ability to manufacture in Canada a class or kind of newsprint machine without unreasonable delay after such newsprint machine of such class or kind had been made outside Canada constitutes the making of a newsprint machine of that class or kind in Canada.\n11. Willingness or ability to manufacture a newsprint machine of a particular class or kind does not constitue manufacture in Canada of a newsprint machine of that class or kind.\n12. The expression class or kind as found in tariff items 427 and 427a must be considered with a reasonable degree of narrowness in that only similar machines must be considered in a determination that a particular machine is of the same class or kind of machine.\n13. The Tariff Board erred in not classifying the imported news print machine under tariff item 427o.\n14. The Tariff Board gave no reasons to justify the conclusion reached as to the classification of the imported machine.\n15. That which purports to be a decision of the Tariff Board was not delivered in accordance with section 3 of the said The Tariff Board Act.\n16. The Tariff Board erred in failing to separately classify calendar rolls imported by the Appellant under Tariff Item 447a rather than Tariff Item 427 having regard to the fact that calendar rolls are dealt with in item 447a and are therefore more specifically defined in that item rather than in the basket item 427, and further in respect to the calendar rolls the Tariff Board failed to make any finding of factor or give any reasons to justify the conclusion reached.\n17. The mechanical differential drive imported by the Appellant constitutes machinery in its own right and accordingly the Tariff Board erred in not considering such mechanical differential drive as a class or kind of machinery not made in Canada and therefore classifiable under tariff item 427a.\nThe Tariff Items in question read as follows:\n427. All machinery composed wholly or in part of iron or steel, n.o.p.; and complete parts thereof. 427 a. All machinery composed wholly or in part of iron or steel, n.o.p., of a class or kind not made in Canada; complete parts of the foregoing.\nThe newsprint machine so imported is composed of iron or steel and is a large and complex piece of machinery composed of many parts. It was built to the specifications of the purchaser and cost approximately $3,000,000.\nAlthough the Notice of Appeal to the Exchequer Court referred specifically to the calendar rolls and the differential drive (Grounds 16 and 17), these grounds were not argued in this Court nor referred to in the respondents' factum.\nThe respondent MacMillan & Bloedel took the position that the design speed of the newsprint machine in question should have been taken by the Tariff Board as the determining factor in arriving at a finding as to whether or not the said newsprint machine was of a class or kind not made in Canada and it argued that the Tariff Board had erred in law in not so finding.\nIt was also urged on behalf of the said respondent that there was in fact no evidence that newsprint machines of the size or speed of the one imported were being made in Canada at any time material to the time when MacMillan & Bloedel contracted to purchase the newsprint machine in question and on the question of the relevant time urged that the date for the determination of the rights of the parties should be taken as the date that said respondent entered into the formal contract to purchase, namely, August 25, 1955. This latter point can, I believe, be disposed of by a reference to s. 43 of the Customs Act, as amended by 3-4 Eliz. II, c. 32, (1955), which appears to say very clearly that the time for determining tariff classification is at the time of entry into Canada of the goods subject to duty, and having regard to the language of this section there can be no justification for fixing any other date as the date upon which the duty, if any, is to be determined.\nThe contention that there was no evidence of newsprint machines being made in Canada prior to the period from November 26, 1956 to June 24, 1957, is untenable. There was considerable evidence upon which the Tariff Board could find that newsprint machines had been and were being manufactured in Canada in the relevant period and in particular there was the evidence that Dominion Engineering Company Limited had, during the period from December 5, 1955 and November 29, 1956, made in Canada and delivered to Powell River Company Limited a newsprint machine known as Powell River No. 9 which had a design speed of 2,500 feet per minute, and there was evidence that John Inglis Company Limited in the years 1954 and 1955 had rebuilt in Canada a number of newsprint machines upgrading those machines from design speeds of 1,800 feet per minute or less to design speeds of up to 2,500 feet per minute.\nThere was accordingly, in my opinion, ample evidence to support the findings of fact in this regard made by the Tariff Board and no error in law was made in arriving at those findings of fact.\nOn the main argument that the Tariff Board erred in law in refusing to find that design speed should be the deciding factor in arriving at a conclusion as to whether or not the said newsprint machine was of a class or kind not made in Canada, the respondent MacMillan & Bloedel relied strongly on the judgment of Judson J. in Dominion Engineering Works Limited v. Deputy Minister of National Revenue[1]. In that case a company known as A. B. Wing Limited had imported into Canada a certain power shovel described as having a nominal dipper capacity of 2 1\/2 cubic yards. It was undisputed that power shovels with a nominal dipper capacity of 2 1\/2 cubic yards or more were not made in Canada at the date of import. Power shovels with a nominal dipper ranging from 1\/2 cubic yard to 2 cubic yards were being made in Canada at that time. The Tariff Board found that a classification of power shovels by nominal dipper capacities was generally understood and accepted by the trade in both Canada and the United States and was probably the most practical single standard according to which these implements could be classified. \"Nominal dipper capacity\" defines a class of power shovel having certain specifications which indicate the work it is capable of doing. It de- fines the over-all capacity and performance of the machine and implies more than a mere difference in size. The submission made by the Deputy Minister of National Revenue in the Dominion Engineering case was that since machines ranging in size up to a nominal dipper capacity of 2 cubic, yards were made in Canada, the machine next larger in size could not, by reason only of the difference in size, be of a different class or kind. The Board held that where the capacities of machines are established in clearly defined sizes \"the least arbitrary and perhaps the best line of demarcation is in accordance with those sizes which are in fact made in Canada as opposed to those sizes which are not.\"\nJudson J. went on to point out that the Board's finding was one of fact and that the Board had heard evidence directed to the question whether these two machines were competitive, interchangeable or equivalent to such a degree as to outweigh the choice of classification by size and further that the Board did not adopt the trade classification automatically and without regard to the other evidence. Judson J. emphasized that it was not a case of a finding being made in the absence of evidence.\nItems 427 and 427a of the Customs Tariff are, as Judson J. points out, plain and unambiguous. Item 427 covers all machinery composed wholly or in part of iron or steel, n.o.p. Item 427a covers all machinery composed wholly or in part of iron or steel, n.o.p. of a class or kind not made in Canada. The machine in question in this action must fall within one or the other of these items according to findings of fact. The Tariff Board had been asked to hold that the newsprint machine in question in these proceedings, because it had a rated mechanical speed of 2,500 feet per minute, came within Item 427a as being of a class or kind not made in Canada, and MacMillan & Bloedel urged that this item of design speed should be the determining factor in classifying whether the newsprint machine in question came under Item 427 or 427 a. The Tariff Board dealt with that submission as follows:\nEvidence was presented to show, in considerable detail, the differences between machines rated at 2,000 feet per minute and more recently produced machines rated at 2,500 feet per minute. Some of these differences, such as the use of a vacum transfer, a longer four-drinier, more driers, a headbox designed to withstand higher pressure, and certain differences in the frames, bearings and rolls, are associated with the increase in design speed. Others, in the opinion of one of the Department's witnesses, are improvements which make for greater efficiency or convenience at any speed.\nDesign speed does appear in all the detailed specifications entered as exhibits; it does define one of the important characteristics of a newsprint machine; and it does convey information with respect to the construction and, given the width, the size and mechanical capacity of the machine. There is no overlapping of design speeds, though the design speed of one very wide machine described \"in the evidence is midway between 2,000 feet per minute and 2,500 feet per minute. However, as appears from the evidence, design speed indicates only one of the primary determinants of the construction and mechanical capabilities of the machine and it is not universally, or even commonly, recognized as a single measure by which the whole machine may be characterized when it is being bought, sold or advertised. We do not accept design speed as the criterion or determinant of class or kind.\nThis is a finding of fact and, in my opinion, there was ample evidence before the Board to justify the finding it made. It is not a case of finding having been made in the absence of evidence. I adopt the language of Judson J. in the Dominion Engineering case where at p. 656 he says:\nWhere are the errors in law asserted by the appellant in this case? I have already stated that in my opinion there was ample evidence before the Board to justify the finding made. This is not a case of a finding being made in the absence of evidence. Further, I am totally unable to discover that in making this classification the Board applied the wrong principle or failed to apply a principle that it should have applied. The task of the Board was to classify a piece of machinery\u2014to determine whether it was of a class or kind not made in Canada. This is a task involving a finding of fact and nothing more. It is not error in law to reject the classification by potential or actual competitive standards and to prefer classification according to a generally accepted trade classification based on size and capacity. I do not think there is any error in the Board's decision but if there were, it could only be one of fact.\nIn my view, Dumoulin J. erred in concluding that the Tariff Board was in error in not finding that the newsprint machine in question was machinery of a class or kind not made in Canada. The finding of the Tariff Board, being one of fact and there being no error in law, should not have been disturbed. The respondent MacMillan & Bloedel, in its Notice of Appeal to the Exchequer Court, raised a question as to the validity of the decision of the Board as follows:\nThat which purports to be a decision of the Tariff Board was not delivered in accordance with section 3 of the Tariff Board Act.\nSubsections (1), (2) and (8) of s. 3 of the Tariff Board Act were amended by 4-5 Eliz. II, c. 15, to read as follows:\n3. (1) There shall be a Board, to be called the Tariff Board, consisting of five members appointed by the Governor in Council.\n(2) The Governor in Council shall appoint one of the members to be Chairman and two members to be Vice-Chairmen; and at sessions of the Board the Chairman shall preside and in his absence one of the Vice-Chairmen.\n(8)With respect to an appeal to the Board under the provisions of the Customs Act or the Excise Tax Act three members, including the Chairman or in his absence one of the Vice-Chairmen, may exercise the powers of the Board.\nand a new subsec. (9) was added reading\n(9) A vacancy on the Board does not impair the right of the remaining members to act.\nIt was argued before the Exchequer Court but not decided by Dumoulin J. that the decision of the Tariff Board was invalid on the ground that the Board at the time it made its decision was not properly constituted. It was alleged that there was no Vice-Chairman at the time of rendering the decision and that Mr. Leduc's appointment as Vice-Chairman had expired after the hearing but before the decision was made and that his reappointment to the Tariff Board was as a member and not as a Vice-Chairman. It was not suggested that the Board was not properly constituted at the time of the hearing. The record, of the proceedings as contained in the case of appeal shows that the hearing commenced February 17, 1959, before Francois J. Leduc, Esq., Vice-Chairman, G. A. Elliott, Member, F. L. Corcoran, Member and J. C. Leslie, Secretary. The decision of the Tariff Board is contained in its declaration dated April 29, 1959, and is signed by J. C. Leslie as Secretary. There is no evidence in the case on appeal to substantiate the allegation that Mr. Francois Leduc was not a Vice-Chairman at the time of the rendering of the decision. In the absence of such evidence, it must be presumed that the Board was properly constituted throughout at all relevant times. See Brunei v. The King[2].\nThe appeal should accordingly be allowed with costs throughout, and it is declared that duty is payable under Tariff Item No. 427.\nAppeal allowed with costs.

(Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1964: October 29; 1965: February 1.\nPresent: Abbott, Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nMunicipal corporations\u2014Drainage ditch constructed by municipality\u2014Silt carried by ditch causing damage to plaintiff's property\u2014Action for damages and an injunction\u2014Statutory defence\u2014Municipal Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 255, ss. 527 and 529.\nThe defendant municipality, in order to drain certain highways, dug a ditch leading into a creek which in turn emptied into Burrard Inlet. The ditch, as originally constructed, caused erosion to adjoining property and in an attempt to remedy that defect the defendant by a fill and extension of the ditch, diverted it to a different arm of the creek. Material eroded by the waters of the ditch was carried along through the creek to build up a delta at its mouth extending some distance into the inlet. Silt from the delta was carried on to the plaintiff's water lot where the plaintiff operated a ship repair yard. The rails of two marine ways extended into the water and the plaintiff operated thereon a cradle on rollers to carry barges and scows above the water level. The plaintiff complained that the silt from the delta was deposited in such quantity as to interfere with the operation of the marine ways and also to decrease the depth of the water alongside the plaintiff's wharf so as to limit access thereto.\nThe plaintiff brought an action for damages and for an injunction, basing its claim upon both negligence and nuisance. The defendant relied upon the power granted to it by s. 527 of the Municipal Act, R.S.B.C 1960, c. 255, and particularly upon the provisions of s. 529 of that statute. The plaintiff was unsuccessful at trial, the judge holding that s. 529 was a bar to the action. The majority of the Court of Appeal, in allowing an appeal, founded liability on the defendant on the basis of its having created a private nuisance in respect of which the provisions of the Municipal Act did not provide any defence. The Court refused to grant an injunction and awarded damages to be assessed, such damages to relate only to what had transpired subsequent to January 27, 1961, when the plaintiff first gave notice to the defendant of the damage which it claimed it had sustained as a result of the defendant's actions. The defendant appealed to this Court and the plaintiff cross-appealed against the refusal of the Court of Appeal to grant the injunction and its refusal to award damages in respect of anything which had transpired prior to January 27, 1961.\nHeld (Spence J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the judgment at trial restored.\nPer Abbott, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.: In relation to the powers granted to the defendant by s. 527 of the Municipal Act, the principles established by such authorities as Groat v. The City of Edmonton, [1928] S.C.R. 522, Manchester Corporation v. Farnworth, [1930] A.C. 171, and Geddis v. Proprietors of the Bann Reservoir (1878), 3 App. Cas. 430, did not entitle the plaintiff to succeed in the present case. Statement of Jenkins L.J. in Marriage v. East Norfolk Rivers Catchment Board, [1950] 1 K.B. 284 at 305 and 306, approved and applied. In addition, in the present case there were the provisions contained in s. 529. That section, in terms, deprived any person, sustaining damage as a result of the exercise by a district municipality of the powers conferred upon it by s. 527, of any right to claim damages therefor by way of an action in a Court of law. This did not mean that there could never be a remedy available to a person whose land had been injuriously affected as a result of the construction, or operation, of a ditch made by a municipality under the powers conferred upon it by s. 527. A remedy for injurious affection of land necessarily resulting from the exercise of statutory powers by a district municipality was provided in s. 478(1).\nPer Spence J., dissenting: Despite the broad words of s. 529 of the Municipal Act, that section was meant to apply only to those cases where damages necessarily resulted from the proper construction of a work and it could not bar the well-established action of the plaintiff for damages caused by unnecessary nuisance or by negligence. However, even if s. 529 would protect the municipality from all damage actions arising out of the construction of a work permitted by s. 527 of the Municipal Act the actual work here constructed was not so permitted. The defendant had diverted the course of the ditch from its earlier line off on an angle to the top of the bank of a dry gully so that the water rushed out of the mouth of the ditch into the dry gully and then 150 feet down that gully to a branch of the creek. It was a matter of interpretation whether by taking the water to the edge of the gully some 150 feet away from any branch of the creek the defendant was conveying to and discharging in the watercourse of the creek.\nAs to the cross-appeal, the judgment of the Court of Appeal was in error in confining the damages to the period following January 27, 1961, and should be amended to provide that the reference as to damages to which the plaintiff was entitled should cover all damage occurring as a result of the construction complained of. The plaintiff's request for an injunction should not be granted. The cross-appeal was not one for which leave had been obtained, and in the circumstances this Court, under s. 44(1) of the Supreme Court Act, had no jurisdiction to grant an appeal against an order made in the exercise of judicial discretion.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], allowing an appeal by the plaintiff from the dismissal of its action at trial. Appeal allowed, Spence J. dissenting.\nB. E. Emerson and B. W. Williams, for the defendant, appellant.\nR. C. Bray and K. S. Fawcus, for the plaintiff, respondent. The judgment of Abbott, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[2], which, by a majority of two to one, allowed the plaintiff's appeal from the dismissal of its action at trial. The case involves the interpretation and application of the relevant sections of the Municipal Act, 1957 (B.C.), c. 42, now R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 255.\nThe facts are concisely stated in the reasons for judgment of Sheppard J.A., who dissented in the Court below, and I am substantially repeating his summary of them.\nIn March and April of 1958 the appellant, a district municipality, in order to drain the highways, Keith Road and Fairway Drive, dug a ditch leading into Taylor Creek, which, in turn, empties into Burrard Inlet. The waters of the ditch, as originally constructed, caused an erosion endangering adjoining property. Therefore, the appellant, in May of 1961, by a fill and extension of the ditch, directed the ditch in a northwesterly direction to a different arm of Taylor Creek. However, the water carried by the ditch, particularly during freshets, eroded the banks and bed of the ditch, and carried this material along through Taylor Creek to build up a delta at the mouth of Taylor Creek extending 300 to 400 feet into the inlet. There the ebb tides, at times, set up counter-eddies which caused silt from the delta to be carried on to the respondent's water lot situate 150 feet to the east. Occasionally a westerly wind would set up a current carrying silt from the delta on to the respondent's water lot. The respondent, on its land, was operating a ship repair yard which included two wharves, a machine shop and two marine ways. The rails of the marine ways extended into the water and the respondent operated thereon a cradle on rollers to carry barges and scows above the water level. The respondent's complaint is that the silt from this delta was deposited in such quantity as to interfere with the operation of the marine ways and also to decrease the depth of the water alongside the respondent's wharf so as to limit access thereto.\nThe appellant does not dispute that silt was carried down by the ditch to form the delta, and from the delta on to the respondent's land. The respondent's claim against the appellant was based on negligence in failing to take proper care in the design and construction of its ditch and also for the creation of a nuisance. The respondent sought damages and an order to compel the appellant to abate the nuisance.\nThe appellant, by its defence, relied upon the statutory powers which had been conferred upon it by the Municipal Act and in particular relied upon s. 529 of the Act.\nThe learned trial judge, who dismissed the respondent's action, concluded his reasons with the following findings:\nHere, in my finding the defendant is a \"district municipality\" (as yet undeveloped) lying at the foot of a mountain range and having frontage of some seven-eight miles on the sea, with some ten major creeks available to it into which to discharge run-off water from its highways. I find that the accretion complained of by plaintiff comes from the discharge of run-off water from Keith Road and Fairway Drive, both of which are highways; and that Taylor Creek is and was the most convenient natural waterway to which defendant could have conveyed such water and discharged it. In its manner of doing so the defendant, in my opinion and finding, fully discharged its obligation to plaintiff. As a district municipality it was and is under no obligation, I think, to construct anything in the nature of a \"Highbury Street Tunnel\" or other expensive artificial work for the purpose of collecting, conveying and discharging into the most convenient natural waterway, the water run-off from its highways.\nFor these reasons I hold that the protective provisions of the Municipal Act above quoted constitute a bar to the plaintiff's claim, which I accordingly dismiss with costs.\nThe majority of the Court of Appeal, in allowing the appeal, founded liability on the appellant on the basis of its having created a private nuisance in respect of which the provisions of the Municipal Act did not provide any defence. The Court refused to grant a mandatory injunction for abatement of the nuisance and awarded damages to be assessed, such damages to relate only to what had transpired subsequent to January 27, 1961, when the respondent first gave notice, by letter, to the appellant of the damage which it claimed it had sustained as a result of the appellant's actions.\nSheppard J. A. was of the opinion that, while the statute did not authorize a negligent or unreasonable construction, and the onus was on the appellant to bring itself within the statute, the appellant had obtained the finding of the learned trial judge in its favour on that point and there was no reason to vary it.\nThe appellant has appealed from the judgment of the Court of Appeal and the respondent has cross-appealed against the refusal of that Court to grant the mandatory injunction and its refusal to award damages in respect of anything which had transpired prior to January 27, 1961.\nIf the respondent was entitled to bring an action in Court in respect of the kind of damages which it has sustained, in my opinion the action should fail, on the basis of the findings made by the learned trial judge and for the reasons given by him and by Sheppard J. A. in the Court of Appeal. In this Court, however, the appellant raised, and I believe for the first time, the point that, when s. 529 of the Municipal Act is read in conjuction with not only s. 527, but also s. 478(1), it is to be construed as preventing any claim being made, by way of an action in a Court of law, in respect of any damage resulting from the construction, maintenance and operation of the ditch in question. It is contended that any claim to compensation for injury to land, resulting from the exercise by a district municipality of the powers given to it by s. 527, is limited to that remedy which is provided by s. 478(1).\nThe provisions of the Municipal Act which are relevant are as follows:\n478. (1) The Council shall make to owners, occupiers, or other persons interested in real property entered upon, taken, expropriated, or used by the municipality in the exercise of any of its powers, or injuriously affected by the exercise of any of its powers, due compensation for any damages (including interest upon the compensation at the rate of six per centum per annum from the time the real property was entered upon, taken, or used) necessarily resulting from the exercise of such powers beyond any advantage which the claimant may derive from the contemplated work; and a claim for compensation, if not mutually agreed upon, shall be decided by three arbitrators to be appointed as hereinafter mentioned, namely: The municipality shall appoint one, the owner or tenant or other person making the claim, or his agent, shall appoint another, and such two arbitrators shall appoint a third arbitrator within ten days after their appointment; but in the event of such two arbitrators not appointing a third arbitrator within the time aforesaid, one of the Judges of the Supreme Court shall, on application of either party by summons in Chambers, of which due notice shall be given to the other party, appoint such third arbitrator.\n***\n527. A district municipality has the right, and is deemed to have had the right since its incorporation, to collect the water from any highway by means of drains or ditches, and to convey to and discharge the said water in the most convenient natural waterway or watercourse.\n528. (1) A district municipality desiring to construct ditches or drains authorized by section 527 may deposit plans and specifications thereof with the Clerk and publish an advertisement once a week for four consecutive weeks in a newspaper published or circulating within the muni- cipality giving public notice that the municipality intends to undertake such works, that plans and specifications thereof may be inspected at the office of the Clerk, and that all claims for damages or compensation arising out of or by reason of the construction, maintenance, operation, or user thereof must be filed with the Clerk within one month from the date of the fourth advertisement.\n(2) No person has any claim for damages or compensation arising out of or by reason of the construction, maintenance, operation, or user of any such ditches or drains unless he has filed a claim as aforesaid. If the municipality proceeds with the said works or portion thereof, every claim shall be determined according to the provisions of Division (4) of Part XII.\n(3) If the construction of such drains or ditches is not commenced within one year from the date when the said advertisement last appeared, the construction shall not be proceeded with unless re-advertised according to subsection (1).\n(4) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to restrict the powers of the municipality which it may otherwise exercise under any other provision of this Act.\n529. No action arising out of, or by reason of, or in respect of, the construction, maintenance, operation, or user of any drain or ditch authorized by section 527, whether such drain or ditch now is or is here after constructed, shall be brought or maintained in any Court against any district municipality.\n530. The provisions of sections 527 to 529 shall be in addition to all provisions made by this or any other Act, and in case of any conflict arising the provisions of sections 527 to 529 shall govern.\nIt is admitted that the appellant did not follow the procedures which are described in s. 528, in respect of the construction of the ditch which is involved in this case.\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeal in favour of the respondent is based upon the proposition that the legal powers granted to the appellant under s. 527 were permissive only, that they could have been exercised by the appellant without the creation of a private nuisance and that s. 529 did not preclude the respondent from bringing action against the appellant. Reliance was placed upon the principles established by such authorities as Groat v. The City of Edmonton[3], Manchester Corporation v. Farnworth[4], and Geddis v. Proprietors of the Bann Reservoir[5].\nWith respect, I do not agree that, in relation to the powers granted to the appellant by s. 527 of the Municipal Act, the principles stated in those cases entitle the respondent to succeed in the present case. In Marriage v. East Norfolk Rivers Catchment Board[6], Jenkins L.J., at pp. 305 and 306, after citing the principles stated in the Geddis and Farnworth cases, goes on to say:\nThe general principle is thus well settled, but its application in any particular case must depend on the object and terms of the statute conferring the powers in question (including the presence or absence of a clause providing for compensation and the scope of any such clause), the nature of the act giving rise to the injury complained of, and the nature of the resulting injury. I venture to think that the questions which arise in any given case of this kind are substantially these: first, was the act which occasioned the injury complained of authorized by the statute?; secondly, did the statute contemplate that the exercise of the powers conferred would or might cause injury to others?; thirdly, if so, was the injury complained of an injury of a kind contemplated by the statute?; and, fourthly, did the statute provide for compensation in respect of any injury of the kind complained of sustained through the exercise of the powers conferred? If the answers to all these questions are in the affirmative then, I think, it must follow that the party injured is deprived of his right of action and left to his remedy in the form of compensation under the statute.\nI am in agreement with this statement and, in my opinion, each of the questions propounded by him would, in the present case, have had to be answered in the affirmative. In addition, in the present case we have the provisions contained in s. 529. That section, in terms, deprived any person, sustaining damage as a result of the exercise by a district municipality of the powers conferred upon it by s. 527, of any right to claim damages therefor by way of an action in a Court of law.\nI turn now to consider the relevant provisions of the Municipal Act previously cited. Section 527 does not merely give a permission for the construction of a specific work. It defines a statutory right of a district municipality to collect water from any highway, by means of drains or ditches, and to convey and discharge the same into the most convenient natural waterway or watercourse.\nAdmittedly the appellant did not comply with s. 528 and the respondent contends that ss. 527 to 530 inclusive constitute a complete code with which the appellant must comply if it is to seek whatever protection is afforded to it by s. 529. However, as was properly pointed out in the reasons of the majority in the Court of Appeal, the wording of s. 528 is permissive and I agree with the conclusion reached that failure to advertise, under s. 528, did not deprive the appellant of whatever protection was afforded by s. 529. In this connection it should be noted that, had the appellant complied with s. 528, the respondent would have had no right whatever to claim any compensation, unless it had filed a claim within one month from the date of the final advertisement; i.e., before the construction of the ditch had commenced and before the impact of that construction on the respondent's lands could have been foreseen or determined.\nIf ss. 527 to 530 inclusive are to be regarded as a complete code, for the application of which compliance with s. 528 is essential, then there seems to be no point whatever in the inclusion in this group of sections of s. 529, because then the whole matter would be governed by subs. (2) of s. 528. Section 529 stands separate and apart from that subsection. It is linked specifically, by its terms, to the exercise of powers under s. 527. In my opinion, the appellant's failure to follow the procedures described in s. 528, while it prevented the appellant from obtaining the protection afforded by subs. (2) of s. 528, did not preclude it from relying upon s. 529.\nThe wording of s. 529 is not limited to preventing legal action against the appellant, in respect of the construction and operation of its ditch, only in cases where the appellant was not negligent, or could not exercise its powers without creating what, at common law, would have been a private nuisance. If it were to be so limited, the section would have no practical effect whatsoever because, in either of such cases, an action could not succeed against the appellant even if s. 529 were not there at all. In my opinion, this section, coupled with the powers granted to the appellant by s. 527, prevented anyone from making any claim in damages, in a Court of law, against the appellant, in respect of any ditch which it constructed, pursuant to the powers granted to it by s. 527.\nThis does not mean that there can never be a remedy available to a person whose land has been injuriously affected as a result of the construction, or operation, of a ditch made by a municipality under the powers conferred upon it by s. 527. A remedy for injurious affection of land necessarily resulting from the exercise of statutory powers by a district municipality is provided in s. 478(1). What s. 529 was intended to accomplish, and, in my opinion, does accomplish, is to provide that such an owner is limited in his remedy to that which is provided in s. 478(1) and that he is precluded from enforcing, by action in a Court of law, any of those remedies which, apart from s. 529, would have been available to him at common law.\nIn my opinion, s. 529 affords a complete defence to the appellant in these proceedings and, accordingly, this appeal should be allowed and the judgment at trial should be restored. The appellant should be entitled to its costs throughout, including the costs of the cross-appeal.\nSPENCE J. (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[7] which, by a majority of two to one, allowed the plaintiff's appeal from the dismissal of his action at trial.\nIn the spring of 1958 the appellant, which is known in British Columbia as a district municipality, in order to drain the highways, Keith Road and Fairway Drive, dug a ditch leading toward Taylor Creek which in turn empties into Burrard Inlet. That ditch, as originally constructed, caused erosion to certain lots on a plan and in an attempt to remedy that defect the appellant, in the month of May 1961, filled in the course of the ditch and thereby diverted it by a trench in another direction leading, as was described in the evidence, to what was said to be another branch of Taylor Creek. It would appear, in fact, that the gully toward which the ditch, as constructed on this second occasion, led was of soft earth and that the force of the spring freshets coursing down this gully eroded to a very considerable extent the soils in the gully, carried them down the gully into Taylor Creek and out into the waters of Burrard Inlet where, by the force of wind and tide, they were swept against the ways of the respondent company causing the marine railway to be blocked and causing very considerable damage to the respondent. There is no dispute that the silt gathering around the marine railway of the respondent was silt carried down Taylor Creek in the freshets. Under these circumstances, the respondent took this action for damages and for an injunction. The respondent based its action upon both negligence and nuisance.\nThe appellant in defence relied upon the power granted to it by s. 527 of the Municipal Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 255, and particularly upon the provisions of s. 529 of that statute. The trial judge held that s. 529 was a bar to the respondent's action and dismissed the action with costs.\nThe majority of the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal finding that the appellant had created a private nuisance in respect to which the aforesaid provisions of the Municipal Act did not provide a defence. The Court of Appeal, however, refused to grant an injunction and limited its damages to those which had occurred after January 27, 1961, when the respondent had first given notice to the appellant of the damage which it claimed it had sustained as a result of the appellant's actions. From that judgment, the appellant appeals to this Court, having been granted leave by the order of the Court dated May 4, 1964. The notice of appeal of the appellant is dated May 11, 1964. The respondent served notice of cross-appeal dated June 19, 1964, in which respondent requested the judgment of the Court of Appeal be varied to permit the damages to be increased and that the injunction requested be granted. No leave was given for such cross-appeal.\nUnder the circumstances, it becomes necessary to interpret and determine the effect of certain sections of the Municipal Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 255, Those sections are as\nfollows:\n478. (1) The Council shall make to owners, occupiers, or other persons interested in real property entered upon, taken, expropriated, or used by the municipality in the exercise of any of its powers, or injuriously affected by the exercise of any of its powers, due compensation for any damages (including interest upon the compensation at the rate of six per centum per annum from the time the real property was entered upon, taken, or used) necessarily resulting from the exercise of such powers beyond any advantage which the claimant may derive from the contemplated work; and a claim for compensation, if not mutually agreed upon, shall be decided by three arbitrators to be appointed as hereinafter mentioned, namely: The municipality shall appoint one, the owner or tenant or other person making the claim, or his agent, shall appoint another, and such two arbitrators shall appoint a third arbitrator within ten days after their appointment; but in the event of such two arbitrators not appointing a third arbitrator within the time aforesaid, one of the Judges of the Supreme Court shall, on application of either party by summons in Chambers, of which due notice shall be given to the other party, appoint such third arbitrator.\n* * *\n527. A district municipality has the right, and is deemed to have had the right since its incorporation, to collect the water from any highway by means of drains or ditches, and to convey to and discharge the said water in the most convenient natural waterway or watercourse. 528. (1) A district municipality desiring to construct ditches or drains authorized by section 527 may deposit plans and specifications thereof with the Clerk and publish an advertisement once a week for four consecutive weeks in a newspaper published or circulating within the municipality giving public notice that the municipality intends to undertake such works, that plans and specfications thereof may be inspected at the office of the Clerk, and that all claims for damages or compensation arising out of or by reason of the construction, maintenance, operation, or user thereof must be filed with the Clerk within one month from the date of the fourth advertisement.\n(2) No person has any claim for damages or compensation arising out of or by reason of the construction, maintenance, operation, or user of any such ditches or drains unless he has filed a claim as aforesaid. If the municipality proceeds with the said works or portion thereof, every claim shall be determined according to the provisions of Division (4) of Part XII.\n(3) If the construction of such drains or ditches is not commenced within one year from the date when the said advertisement last appeared, the construction shall not be proceeded with unless readvertised according to subsection (1).\n(4) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to restrict the powers of the municipality which it may otherwise exercise under any other provision of this Act.\n529. No action arising out of or by reason of, or in respect of, the construction, maintenance, operation, or user of any drain or ditch authorized by section 527, whether such drain or ditch now is or is hereafter constructed, shall be brought or maintained in any Court against any district municipality.\n530. The provisions of sections 527 to 529 shall be in addition to all provisions made by this or any other Act, and in case of any conflict arising the provisions of section 527 to 529 shall govern.\nIt is the contention of the appellant that it was given power to construct the ditch by s. 527 of the Municipal Act and that all actions against it are barred by the provisions of s. 529. It is agreed that the appellant municipality did not deposit a plan with the Clerk and insert the adverisements required by s. 528 of the Municipal Act. The appellant further submits that the respondent was not deprived of its remedy as it could always have proceeded to arbitration under the provisions of s. 478 of the Municipal Act. It is the respondent's submission that s. 529 of the Municipal Act does not bar actions which are based upon either negligence or unnecessary nuisance caused in the construction of a work.\nThe appellant cites in support of this proposition, interalia, Groat v. The City of Edmonton[8]; Manchester Corporation v. Farnworth[9], at p. 88; Guelph Worsted Spinning Co. v. City of Guelph[10], at p. 82; and Fraser v. Vancouver[11], at pp. 730 and 735. Those authorities are examples of the well-established principle which may be gathered from a short statement by Duff J. at p. 527 of Groat v. The City of Edmonton:\nThat the municipality possesses authority under its charter to construct sewers and drains for carrying away water from its streets is beyond question. But it is only in respect of the authorized works and the necessary results of such works that the municipality is entitled to the protection of the statute; and that protection is not available where the nature of the specific work alleged to be authorized under the statute is not made to appear. In this case, no by-law or other instrument evidencing authority or defining the work alleged to be authorized was adduced; and there is no finding, either by the trial judge or by the Appellate Division, that the nuisance complained of was authorized, or was the necessary result of works authorized pursuant to the charter.\nMiddleton J. in the Guelph Worsted case at pp. 80 and 81 quotes from Lord Blackburn in the Metropolitan Asylum District Managers v. Hill et al.[12], at p. 203:\nWhere the Legislature directs that a thing shall at all events be done, the doing of which, if not authorized by the Legislature, would entitle any one to an action, the right of action is taken away\u2026 The Legislature has often interfered with the right of private persons, but in modern times it has generally given compensation to those injured; and if no compensation is given it affords a reason, though not a conclusive one, for thinking that the intention of the Legislature was, not that the thing should be done at all events, but only that it should be done, if it could be done, without injury to others.\nSurely, that the ditch was dug in both cases in a negligent fashion is established by the evidence of Douglas A. Welsh for the defendant who admitted that he did not examine the particular area from the point of view of the erosion factor of the soil at all and that he was not concerned with erosion. The nuisance is, of course, self-evident.\nThe submission of the appellant is that s. 529 of the Municipal Act requires those cases to be distinguished as in none of the aforesaid cases was there any counterpart of the present s. 529 of the Municipal Act.\nI have examined those authorities and others and I have found that in no case where this proposition was enunciated was there a bar of action similar to that contained in s. 529. It is, therefore, necessary to examine the said s. 529 and determine whether it was meant to apply to the circumstances present in this case. It is the contention of the respondent that ss. 527 to 530 of the Municipal Act composed a code, the sections are inter-related and that the appellant cannot rely upon s. 529 of the statute unless the appellant has complied with the requirements of s. 528, which, of course, the appellant had not complied with in the present case. Despite the fact that s. 528 is, by its terms, permissive, there would seem to be considerable weight to the contention of the respondent. In the statute, the heading above s. 527 is \"Subdivision (c)\u2014Special Provision for District Municipalities\", and that sub-division covers the sections from 527 to 530 inclusive. I am, however, impressed by the fact that under s. 528(2) no person had any claim for damages or compensation arising out of the construction or maintenance or operation or user of a ditch unless he had filed a claim as permitted by subs. (1), i.e., within one month from the date of the fourth advertisement, while the very damage with which this action is concerned could not have been discovered within that limited time and therefore no claim could be enforced by arbitration under s. 528 even if the advertisements had been properly inserted. The appellants answer by pointing out the provisions of s. 478 and submit that the arbitration under that section was always available to the respondent. A reference to s. 478 of the Municipal Act shows that it requires compensation to be made for injurious affection by the exercise of the corporation's powers for damages necessarily resulting from the exercise of such powers beyond any advantage which the claimant may derive from the contemplated work. It is here the contention of the respondent and it would seem to be confirmed by the evidence that the damage did not necessarily result from the construction of the ditch but only resulted from the improper construction of the ditch and that therefore the respondents would not have had a right to claim compensation under s. 478 of the Municipal Act.\nI am, therefore, of the opinion that despite the broad words of s. 529 of the Municipal Act, it was meant to apply only to those cases where damages necessarily resulted from the proper construction of a work and it cannot bar the well-established action of the respondent for damages caused by unnecessary nuisance or by negligence. It matters not under which head the cause of action be put. I, therefore, wish to adopt the words of Whittaker J. A. in his judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia when he said:\nIn my opinion sections 527 to 529 inclusive may be read together. Section 529 is a bar to any action for damage inevitably resulting from the carrying out of the authorized work. The Legislature did not, I think, intend to relieve the Municipality from liability for negligence or for the unjustifiable creation of a nuisance. That result could only be achieved by the use of explicit language, or by necessary implication.\nI have up until this point considered the appeal upon the basis that the work performed by the appellant corporation was work authorized by s. 527 of the Municipal Act. That section gave the district municipality the right \"to collect the water from any highway by means of drains or ditches and to convey it to and discharge the said water in the most convenient natural waterway or watercourse\". The evidence established that what the appellant corporation did was to divert the course of the ditch from its earlier line off on an angle to the top of the bank of a dry gully so that the water rushed out of the mouth of this ditch into the dry gully and then 150 feet down that gully to a branch of the Taylor Creek. It is the contention of the respondent that that was not conveying the water to and discharging the said water in the most convenient natural waterway or watercourse but was only conveying the water to a point where by the action of gravity it would eventually flow into the Taylor Creek. The appellant submits that the respondent is here met with concurrent findings of fact by the trial judge and the Court of Appeal. I am of the opinion, on examining the record, that this cannot be substantiated.\nSullivan J., at trial, said:\nI find that the accretion complained of by plaintiff comes from the discharge of run-off water from Keith Road and Fairway Drive, both of which are highways; and that Taylor Creek is and was the most convenient natural waterway to which defendant could have conveyed such water and discharged it. In its manner of doing so the defendant, in my opinion and finding, fully discharged its obligation to plaintiff.\nSheppard J.A., giving the minority judgment in the Court of Appeal, said:\nIn March and April of 1958 the defendant, a District Municipality, in order to drain the highways, Keith Road and Fairway Drive, dug a ditch leading into Taylor Creek which in turn empties into Burrard Inlet. Whittaker J.A., giving judgment for the majority in the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, said:\nIt is conceded that Taylor Creek is the most convenient natural waterway or watercourse in which to discharge the water from this particular drainage area. The appellant contended that respondent, by bringing the ditch to the edge of the gully rather than to the creek bed, did not discharge the water into the Taylor Creek \"waterway or watercourse\". I think the learned trial judge was right in refusing to give effect to this contention.\nI am of the opinion that in so far as those findings were findings that Taylor Creek was the most convenient watercourse they are findings of fact. I have no quarrel with such findings nor did the respondent in its argument in this Court. In so far as the findings are that the appellant conveyed to and discharged the water into Taylor Creek they are surely subject to the evidence which is only to the effect I have outlined above and it is a matter of interpretation whether by taking the water to the edge of the gully some 150 feet away from any branch of Taylor Creek it is conveying to and discharging in the watercourse of Taylor Creek. I am not ready to so interpret the statute and I am of the conclusion that even if s. 529 would protect the municipality from all damage actions arising out of the construction of a work permitted by s. 527 of the Municipal Act the actual work here constructed was not so permitted. For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal of the appellant municipal corporation.\nI now turn to the cross-appeal and, firstly, deal with the cross-appeal as to the limitation of the plaintiff's right to damages to those which occurred in the period after January 27, 1961.\nWhittaker J.A., in coming to the conclusion that the respondent's damages should be so limited quoted a passage from Salmond on Torts, 13th ed., at p. 200, and remarked that the words \"as when it is caused by a secret and unobservable operation of nature\" did not exist in the said passage in the 5th edition which had been approved by Lord Maugham and Lord Wright in Sedleigh-Denfield v. O'Callaghan et al.[13] That such a statement should not be taken to exclude the liability of the actual creator of the nuisance for any damage which occurred after the commencement of the nuisance is, in my opinion, confirmed by reference to the same learned author who, in the 13th edition at p. 204, states:\nHe who by himself or by his servants by a positive act of misfeasance (as opposed to a mere nonfeasance, such as an omission to repair) creates a nuisance is always liable for it, and for any continuance of it, whether he be the owner, the occupier or a stranger, and notwithstanding the fact that it exists on land which is not in his occupation, and that he has therefore no power to put an end to it.\nI am of the opinion that the learned justice in appeal was in error in confining the damages to the period following January 27, 1961, and I would amend the judgment of the Court of Appeal to provide that the reference as to damages to which the respondent is entitled should cover all damage occurring as a result of the construction complained of.\nAs to the respondent's cross-appeal in which it requests that the injunction prayed for in the original action should be granted, as was observed in the course of the argument, the provisions of s. 44(1) of the Supreme Court Act provide:\nNo appeal lies to the Supreme Court from a judgment or order made in the exercise of judicial discretion except in proceedings in the nature of a suit or proceedings in equity originating elsewhere than in the Province of Quebec and except in mandamus proceedings.\nIt is provided in subs. (2) that subs. (1) should not apply to an appeal under s. 41. The appeal in this case by the appellant municipality was an appeal under s. 41, i.e., with leave to appeal. The cross-appeal, however, was not one for which any leave had been obtained, the respondent as cross-appellant merely relying on its right under R, 100. Under such circumstances, I am of the opinion that this Court has no jurisdiction to grant an appeal against an order made in the exercise of judicial discretion and I would not provide that the injunction should issue.\nIn the result, the appeal of the appellant municipality is dismissed, the cross-appeal of the respondent is allowed only as to the aforesaid variation in the reference as to damages. The respondent is entitled to its costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed and judgment at trial restored with costs throughout to the appellant, Spence J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Andrews, Swinton, Emerson and Williams, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: Clark, Wilson, White, Clark and Maguire, Vancouver.\n[1] (1964), 47 W.W.R. 30, 44 D.L.R.

I960, c. 249, s. 206(1) (a) and (2)\u2014The Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 260, ss. 229(1), 230(1), (2) and (10).\nPursuant to the power conferred by subs. (2) of s. 116a of The Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 260, as enacted by 1961-62, c. 88, s. 10 and amended by 1962-63, c. 89, s. 8, the Council of the defendant adopted the recommendation of its Executive Committee that a subsidy of $2,500,000 be paid to the Toronto Transit Commission. For this expenditure a supplementary estimate was certified to the Council by the Executive Committee. The Metropolitan Council enacted by-law 1890 levying the additional sum of $2,500,000 upon the area municipalities, including the plaintiff, and requiring the treasurer of each municipality to pay to the treasurer of the defendant the amounts thereby levied. Prior to the passing of by-law 1890 the plaintiff had enacted a rating by-law and pursuant thereto had commenced sending out tax bills.\nThe plaintiff contended that by-law 1890 was invalid on the ground that since the Council had previously adopted its estimates for the year, enacted its rating by-law 1869 and set in motion the tax collecting procedures for the year its statutory power was exhausted and it was not competent thereafter to make a further tax levy for the same year. The plaintiff\u2019s action for a declaration that by-law 1890 was ultra vires and void and claiming consequential relief was dismissed by the trial judge. The trial judgment having been affirmed, on appeal, by the Court of Appeal, the plaintiff further appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nUpon the enactment of subs. (2) of s. 116a followed by the decision of the Metropolitan Council to contribute the sum of $2,500,000 to the cost of operating the transportation system during the year 1963 that amount became a sum \u201crequired during the year for the purposes of the Metropolitan Corporation\u201d within the meaning of s. 229(1) of the Metropolitan Act and part of the \u201cproposed expenditure of the year\u201d within the meaning of s. 206(1) (a) of The Municipal Act. There could be no doubt of the duty of the Executive Committee to include this sum in the estimates for the year 1963 or of the power of the Metropolitan Council to include it in the levy made upon the area municipalities pursuant to s. 230(1) of the Metropolitan Act were it not for the fact that estimates for the year had already been adopted and a levying by-law passed. The trial judge in rejecting the plaintiff\u2019s argument that once by-law 1869 had been passed the power of the Metropolitan Council to make a levy was exhausted for that year relied on cl. (j) of s. 27 of The Interpretation Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 191. Here it was held, even without having recourse to that clause, that the Courts below were correct in the unanimous view that on their true interpretation s. 206(1) (a) and (2) of The Municipal Act and ss. 229(1), 230(1), (2) and (10) of the Metropolitan Act empowered the Executive Committee to certify the supplementary estimate calling for the payment of $2,500,000 and empowered the Metropolitan Council to adopt that estimate and to pass by-law 1890.\nRobertson v.

Joy, Q.C., for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirming a judgment of Hughes J. dismissing an action brought by the appellant asking for a declaration that by-law no. 1890 passed by the respondent on May 7, 1963, is ultra vires and void and claiming consequential relief.\nThe matter was dealt with by Hughes J. on a motion 1 for judgment based on the pleadings and on an agreement by the parties as to the facts.\nThe agreement as to the facts is set out in full in the reasons for judgment of Hughes J.[1] The Township of Etobicoke which was also a plaintiff has not appealed to this Court and the appellant abandoned in the Court of Appeal the grounds of attack on the by-law based on alleged errors in procedure, consequently a comparatively brief statement of the facts will be sufficient to make clear the question raised for decision.\nThe ground on which the appellant argues that by-law 1890 is invalid is that since the Council of the respondent had on April 5, 1963, adopted its estimates for the year, enacted its rating by-law no. 1869 and set in motion the tax collecting procedures for the year its statutory power was exhausted and it was not competent thereafter to make a further tax levy in the same year.\nThe appellant is one of thirteen area municipalities which constitute the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto.\nUnder The Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 260, hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Metropolitan Act\u201d, the Council in each year fixes a metropolitan rate apportioned among the area municipalities. Upon the Metropolitan Clerk certifying to each of the area municipalities the particulars of the levy made against it, it becomes the duty of the area municipality to take the appropriate measures to see that the metropolitan levy and the levies within the control of the area municipality are put in hand for collection and collected. The metropolitan levy when properly made becomes a debt of the area municipality.\nThe assessment rolls upon which these levies are made are rolls of the area municipalities but are prepared by the Metropolitan Assessment Commissioner, who is also the assessment commissioner ex officio of each area municipality. The levy in each area municipality, based on the assessment roll of the year, is made by the council of that municipality by its own rating by-law (or by-laws) which form the basis upon which the proper officer of the area municipality prepares the collector\u2019s roll for the year, sends out the tax bills and looks after the collection of the taxes.\nOn April 26, 1963, subsequent to the passing of by-law 1869 but prior to the passing of by-law 1890, s. 116a of the Metropolitan Act, as enacted by s. 10 of 1961-62 (Ont.), c. 88, was amended by 1962-63, c. 89, s. 8, adding thereto the following subsection:\n(2) The Metropolitan Corporation may contribute to the cost of operating the transportation system operated by the Commission.\n(i.e. The Toronto Transit Commission).\nPursuant to the power conferred by this subsection, the Council of the respondent on May 3, 1963, adopted the recommendation of its Executive Committee that a subsidy of $2,500,000 be paid in 1963 to the Toronto Transit Commission, such payment to be conditional upon the revocation of an increase in fares recently instituted by the Commission. For this expenditure a supplementary estimate was certified to the Council on the same date by the Executive Committee.\nOn May 7, 1963, the Metropolitan Council enacted bylaw 1890 levying the additional sum of $2,500,000 upon the area municipalities, including the appellant, and requiring the treasurer of each municipality to pay to the treasurer of the respondent the amounts thereby levied. Prior to the passing of by-law 1890 the appellant had enacted a rating by-law and pursuant thereto had commenced sending out tax bills.\nIn my opinion by-law 1890 was validly enacted.\nIt is provided by subss. (1) and (2) of s. 12 of the Metropolitan Act that the Metropolitan Council may by by\u2011law provide for the appointment of an Executive Committee and authorize it to exercise with respect to the Metropolitan Corporation any or all of the powers of a board of control under subs. (1) of s. 206 of The Municipal Act and that in such case subss. (2) to (15) and (17) to (19) of that section apply mutatis mutandis. By by-law enacted on October 30, 1962, the respondent constituted an Executive Committee and authorized it to execute the powers so conferred. Subsections (1) and (2) of s. 206 of The Municipal Act so far as relevant are as follows:\n206. (1) It is the duty of the board of control,\n(a) to prepare estimates of the proposed expenditure of the year and certify them to the council for its consideration;\n* * *\n(2) The council shall not appropriate or expend, nor shall any officer thereof expend or direct the expenditure of any sum not provided for by the estimates or by a special or supplementary estimate certified by the board to the council, without a two-thirds vote of the council authorizing such appropriation or expenditure, but this prohibition does not extend to the payment of any debenture or other debt or liability of the corporation.\nSection 229(1) of the Metropolitan Act is as follows:\n(1) The Metropolitan Council shall in each year prepare and adopt \u2018estimates of all sums required during the year for the purposes of the Metropolitan Corporation, including the sums required by law to be provided by the Metropolitan Council for school purposes and for any local board of the Metropolitan Corporation, and such estimates shall \u2022set forth the estimated revenues and expenditures in such detail and \u2022according to such form as the Department may from time to time prescribe.\nSubsections (1) and (2) of s. 230 of the same Act are as follows:\n(1) The Metropolitan Council shall in each year levy against the area municipalities a sum sufficient\n(a) for payment of the estimated current annual expenditures as adopted;\n(b) for payment of all debts of the Metropolitan Corporation falling due within the year as well as amounts required to be raised for sinking funds and principal and interest payments or sinking fund requirements in respect of debenture debt of area municipalities for the payment of which the Metropolitan Corporation is liable under this Act.\n(2) The Metropolitan Council shall ascertain and by by-law direct what portion of the sum mentioned in subsection 1 shall be levied against and in each area municipality.\nSubsection (10) of s. 230 is as follows:\n(10) One by-law or several by-laws for making the levies may be passed as the Metropolitan Council may deem expedient.\nUpon the enactment of subs. (2) of s. 116a followed by the decision of the Metropolitan Council to contribute the sum of $2,500,000 to the cost of operating the transportation system during the year 1963 that amount became a sum \u201crequired during the year for the purposes of the Metropolitan Corporation\u201d within the meaning of s. 229 (1) of the Metropolitan Act and part of the \u201cproposed expenditure of the year\u201d within the meaning of s. 206(1) (a) of The Municipal Act. There could be no doubt of the duty of the Executive Committee to include this sum in the estimates for the year 1963 or of the power of the Metropolitan Council to include it in the levy made upon the area municipalities pursuant to s. 230(1) of the Metropolitan Act were it not for the fact that estimates for the year had already been adopted and a levying by-law passed. The appellant argues that once by-law 1869 had been passed the power of the Metropolitan Council to make a levy was exhausted for that year. Hughes J., in rejecting this argument, relied on cl. (j) of s. 27 of The Interpretation Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 191, which reads as follows:\n27. In every Act, unless the contrary intention appears,\n* * *\n(j) words importing the singular number or the masculine gender only include more persons, parties or things of the same kind than one, and females as well as males and the converse;\nEven without having recourse to that clause, I would agree with the unanimous view of the Courts below that on their true construction the sections which I have quoted above empowered the Executive Committee to certify the supplementary estimate calling for the payment of the $2,500,000 and empowered the Metropolitan Council to adopt that estimate and to pass by-law 1890.\nWhether or not it was strictly necessary to the decision of that case, I rely, as did Hughes J., on the following passage in the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal delivered by Middleton J.A. in Robertson v. City of Toronto[2], at pp. 44 and 45:\nIn cities where there is a board of control, sec. 221 governs, and it casts upon the board the duty of preparing estimates of the proposed expenditure for the year, and certifying these estimates to the council for consideration. It also contains a very important provision, found in subsec. 2, that the council shall not appropriate or expend any sum not provided for by the estimates \u2018or by a special or supplementary estimate certified by the board to the council, without a two-thirds vote of the council authorising such appropriation or expenditure.\u2019\nThis indicates that there is not a finality in the first estimates passed by the municipality, and this is emphasized by the provision of sec. 307(2), that \u2018one by-law or several by\u2011laws for assessing and levying the rates may be passed as the council may deem expedient.\u2019\nThe sections under consideration in that case did not differ in any material particular from those with which we are concerned. For the appellant reliance was placed upon the following passage in the unanimous judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Upper Canada delivered by J. Wilson J. in In re Hogg v. Rogers[3], at p. 419:\nThe general principle is, that levies for municipal purposes shall be made upon the revised assessment of the year in which they are made. It is true that one rate for the year is only struck by the municipal authorities; but suppose a sheriff got an execution either at a suit of the Crown or of a municipality in the month of January, would he be justified in delaying to levy until the revised assessment roll of that year was completed and a certified copy given to the municipality?\nWhat was actually decided in that case was that school trustees were not restricted by the applicable legislation to making one levy during a year but might levy at any time as need required it. The words which I have italicized in the passage quoted were, I think, a statement as to the prevailing practice rather than a decision as to the powers of the municipal authorities. It seems clear that the Court assumed that the answer to the rhetorical question with which the passage concludes would be in the negative.\nI share the view of the Court of Appeal that it is unnecessary to determine whether the decision of the Metropolitan Council to pay the sum of $2,500,000 created a \u201cdebt\u201d of the corporation within the meaning of that word as used in s. 206(2) of The Municipal Act or in s. 230(1)(b) of the Metropolitan Act; subject to this, I am in substantial agreement with the reasons of Hughes J. dealing with the construction and effect of the statutory provisions which I have quoted above and I agree with the conclusion at which he arrived.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Manning, Bruce, Paterson & Ridout, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Blake, Cassels & Graydon, Toronto.\n[1] [1964] 1 O.L.R. 507 at pp. 508 to 512.\n[2] [1930], 66 O.L.R. 38.\n[3] (1865), 15 U.C.C.P. 417.\n",

Boyd Builders Ltd., [1965] S.C.R. 408\nDate: 1965-03-18\nThe Corporation of the City of Ottawa and Michael C. Instance, Acting Building Inspector for the said City of Ottawa and Maxwell C. Taylor, Building Inspector for the said City of Ottawa (Respondents) Appellants;\nand\nBoyd Builders Limited (Applicant) Respondent.\n1965: February 16, 17; 1965: March 18.\nPresent: Cartwright, Abbott, Martland, Judson and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nMunicipal corporations\u2014Application for building permit refused\u2014Prima facie right to have permit granted\u2014Municipality seeking to defeat prima facie right by enactment of rezoning by\u2011law\u2014Application for mandamus\u2014Municipality failing to manifest that it was proceeding on a pre-existing clear intention to restrict lands in question and was acting in good faith in so doing.\nThe respondent company having been assured by officers of the appellant municipality that certain lands were zoned to permit apartment houses purchased the said lands and then immediately instructed its architects to draft plans for an apartment house and by the agency of the architects submitted an application for a building permit. The property had stood unaffected by building restrictions from July 1936 until March 1963, when, as a result of the enactment of a general zoning by-law, the lands were zoned in a category permitting the erection of apartments. Apart from certain minor modifications, the plans submitted were such as would justify the granting of a building permit and the acting building inspector admitted that if he had not been instructed by the Board of Control to refuse the permit he would have granted one.\nUpon it becoming known that an application had been made a clamour was raised by surrounding residents. The Ottawa Planning Area Board met on September 18, 1963, considered the objections of the surrounding residents and recommended that the lands in question be rezoned so as to prohibit the building of apartment houses. At a meeting of Council on the following day the report of the Planning Board was considered and approved and a by-law (No. 311\/63) making the recommended variations in zoning was passed. The respondent was given no notice of either the meeting of the Planning Board or of Council.\nThe city applied to the Ontario Municipal Board for approval of by-law 311\/63 and shortly thereafter the respondent made application for a mandatory order requiring the issue of a building permit. That application was adjourned pending the hearing of the city\u2019s application to the Municipal Board. On appeal, the Court of Appeal held that the application for the mandatory order should not have been adjourned and that upon the facts the respondent had a prima facie right to be granted a building permit and that the municipality was not acting in good faith and impartially when it enacted by-law 311\/63 thus defeating the respondent\u2019s prima facie right. The appellants appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nUnder the provisions of s. 30(9) of The Planning Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 296, by-law 311\/63 was not in effect unless and until approved by the Municipal Board. Therefore, when the respondent made application for a building permit and later when refused made application for a mandatory order that a building permit be issued, there was no valid by-law in existence prohibiting the grant of such permit. Therefore, the respondent had a prima facie right to the permit and upon its refusal a prima facie right to a mandatory order that it should be granted. This prima facie right might only be defeated if the municipality demonstrated that it had in existence a clear plan for zoning the neighbourhood with which it was proceeding in good faith and with dispatch.\nThe argument that the Courts in Ontario lacked power to grant the mandatory order on the ground that there was an alternative legal remedy, i.e., the right to move to quash the by\u2011law, or to be heard before the Board, was not accepted. Despite the provisions of s. 277(1) of The Municipal Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 249, which provided a procedure for an application by way of originating motion to quash a by-law, and s. 30(9) of The Planning Act, the respondent having, at the date when it filed its application for a building permit, the prima facie right to have that permit granted, could insist upon the hearing of the application for mandamus that the municipality manifest that it had a clear zoning plan upon which it was proceeding in good faith and with dispatch. In the circumstances, the appellant had failed to manifest that it was proceeding on a pre-existing clear intention to restrict the lands in question and was acting in good faith in so doing.\nHammond v.

Jennings, Q.C., for the appellants.\nG.F. Henderson, Q.C., and K. Radnofi, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nSPENCE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] dated April 23, 1964, which allowed an appeal from the order of Mr, Justice Schatz. By that latter order, Mr. Justice Schatz had adjourned, pending the hearing of the appellants\u2019 application for approval by the Ontario Municipal Board, an application by Boyd Builders Limited for a mandatory order requiring the City of Ottawa and its building inspector to issue a building permit as to certain lands on Sherwood Drive in the city upon which it was proposed to erect an apartment house.\nRoach J.A., giving judgment in the Court of Appeal, upon recital of the facts some of which will be referred to hereafter, held that the application for the mandatory order should not have been adjourned and that upon the facts the applicant Boyd Builders Limited had a prima facie right to be granted a building permit and that the municipality was not acting in good faith and impartially when it enacted by-law 311\/63 thus defeating the applicant\u2019s prima facie right.\nAn owner has a prima facie right to utilize his own property in whatever manner he deems fit subject only to the rights of surrounding owners, e.g., nuisance, etc. This prima facie right may be defeated or superseded by rezoning if three prerequisites are established by the municipality, (a) a clear intent to restrict or zone existing before the application by the owner for a building permit, (b) that council has proceeded in good faith, and (c) that council has proceeded with dispatch.\nCounsel for the appellants in this Court advanced a proposition which he states was fully argued in the Court of Appeal but which is not reflected in any way in the reasons of Roach J.A. giving the judgment of that Court. This argument is that the Courts in Ontario lack power to grant the mandatory order and for the following reasons. The Municipal Act, in s. 277(1) provided a definite procedure for an application by way of originating motion to quash a by\u2011law. The Planning Act in s. 30 provides in subs. (9) for approval of a zoning by-law by the Municipal Board and that the by-law would only be effective upon such approval. Mr. Jennings argued that the by-law was not illegal on its face and it could only be quashed because of bad faith or discrimination established in an application to quash. Mr. Jennings further submitted that the applicant had two courses available to it. It could make an application to the Court to quash or it could allow the application for approval required by s. 30(9) of The Planning Act to go before the Municipal Board and there appear to oppose. Counsel pointed out the provisions of The Ontario Municipal Board Act, particularly ss. 33 to 37, 53, 56, and 92 to 95, submitted that the Legislature had selected the Municipal Board to determine exclusively whether the by-law should be brought into effect and, inter alia, to decide all questions of fact including good faith.\nI am of the opinion that the approach of the Court of Appeal for Ontario is a sound one. Under the provisions of s. 30(9) of The Planning Act the by-law is not in effect unless and until approved by the Municipal Board. Therefore, when Boyd Builders Limited made application for a building permit and later when refused made application for a mandatory order that a building permit be issued, there was no valid by-law in existence prohibiting the grant of such permit. Therefore, Boyd Builders Limited had a prima facie right to the permit and upon its refusal a prima facie right to a mandatory order that it should be granted. This prima facie right may only be defeated if the municipality demonstrates that it has in existence a clear plan for zoning the neighbourhood with which it is proceeding in good faith and with dispatch.\nI see no necessity for the applicant for the permit taking on itself the task of proceeding to quash the by-law. It may well be that the by-law applies to a very large area and, of course, the building permit would apply to only a part thereof. It may be that in so far as the balance of the area is concerned, there is a valid plan of rezoning and that so far as the owners of such balance of the area are concerned council is proceeding in good faith and with dispatch.\nWhat the applicant seeks in these proceedings is the enforcement of his common law right, and that common law right should be viewed as of the date of the filing of its application for a permit subject to the common law right being superseded in the fashion I have outlined by events which may occur even after the date of the filing of the application for a permit and before the application for a mandatory order.\nThe series of cases in Ontario included examples both where the by-law, although non-existent at the time of the application for the permit was in existence at the time of the hearing of the application for a mandamus, and others where the by-laws were not in existence at such later date. Some of the applications for mandamus had been granted and some have been refused. Some have been refused and the matter adjourned even when no by-law existed at the time of the hearing of the application for mandamus: Re Marckity et al. and the Town of Fort Erie and Burger[2]. There are other cases and frequent cases where the by-law had been enacted between the date of the application for a building permit and the date of the hearing of the application for mandamus which followed the refusal of the permit, and where the mandamus had been granted. It is true that most of these cases are decisions of single judges, e.g., Re Bridgman and City of Toronto et al.[3], Re Greene and City of Ottawa[4], Re Beaver Lumber Co. Ltd. and Township of London[5], Re Skyway Drive-In Theatres Ltd. and Township of London[6], Re Cooksville Co. Ltd. and Township of York et al.[7] There were, however, several in the Court of Appeal. Although Hammond v. City of Hamilton[8] is a case where there had not yet been a by-law enacted at the time of hearing the application for mandamus, the proposition there enunciated and particularly that set out by Roach J.A. at p. 221, has been adopted both by single court judges and by the Court of Appeal in cases where a by-law was enacted during the intervening period: Sun Oil Co. Ltd. v. Town of Whitby[9], Re Markham Developments Ltd. and Township of Scarborough[10] These are cases where the prima facie right of the applicant to have a building permit has been held by the Court not to have been superseded because the municipality has not fulfilled the three requirements outlined by Roach J.A. in Hammond v. Hamilton, supra.\nI, therefore, am of the opinion that despite the provisions of The Municipal Act and The Planning Act, the applicant Boyd Builders Limited having, at the date when it filed its application for a building permit, the prima facie right to have that permit granted, could insist upon the hearing of the application for mandamus that the municipality manifest that it had a clear zoning plan upon which it was proceeding in good faith and with dispatch. In so far as the previous sentence puts the onus upon the municipality, I agree with counsel for the respondent that such is the effect of Sun Oil v. Whitby, supra, and the judgment of LeBel J. in Bolton v. Munro et al.[11] The judgment of this Court in Kuchma v. Rural Municipality of Tache[12], and that of the Appellate Division in Re Howard and City of Toronto[13], fixing the onus upon the applicant should be confined to the situation where the applicant seeks to quash a by-law. There, the applicant is in a position of a plaintiff and has the onus, and particularly has the onus of proving bad faith. On the other hand, where the applicant seeks a mandamus to which he has a prima facie right and the municipality seeking to defeat that prima facie right, alleges, inter alia, its good faith the onus should be on it to establish such good faith. However, in the particular case, I am of the opinion that onus is quite unimportant. The facts are not in dispute. For 26 years, these lands stood without building restrictions. They had been restricted by by-law 8214 passed in 1936 and then that restriction was removed by amending by-law 8255 of the same year. The property stood unaffected by building restrictions from July 1936 to March 1963. A general zoning by-law, No. 68\/63, was then enacted which provided that the lands in question here should be zoned R-5, a zoning category permitting the erection of apartments. Section 112 of that by-law provided that notwithstanding its enactment, when areas were covered by other by-laws set out in the schedule, the zoning provided by such other by-laws should remain in effect. The aforesaid by-law 8214 was set out in the schedule. That by-law, of course, must be considered in its amended form, i.e., that the lands here in question were excepted therefrom by 8255, so that the result of the general zoning by-law was to zone these lands as R-5. There was produced upon the hearing of the appeal, one of the zoning maps which formed part of the said by-law 68\/63 which map indicated in heavy dark print the zoning designation R-5 immediately over the lands in question.\nIn these circumstances, Boyd Builders Limited inquired carefully as to the restrictions covering the property and were correctly assured by municipal officers that the lands were zoned to permit apartment houses. Acting on that assurance, Boyd Builders Limited took options and have since completed the purchase of two pieces of land at a total cost of about $60,000 then immediately instructed its architects to draft plans for an apartment house and by the agency of the architects, on Sepember 9, 1963, submitted an application for a building permit. Apart from certain minor modifications, these plans were such as would justify the granting of a building permit and the acting building inspector, the appellant Instance, admitted that if he had not been instructed to refuse the permit he would have granted one on September 19, 1963. He did not do so, however, because upon it becoming known that the application had been made for such permit surrounding residents raised a clamour, the Ottawa Planning Board met on September 18, 1963, considered the objections of these surrounding property owners, and recommended that the lands in question be rezoned in such a fashion as to prohibit the building of apartment houses. No notice of this meeting of the Ottawa Planning Board was given to any representative of Boyd Builders Limited and no officer of that company had knowledge of it.\nAt the meeting of council on the very next day, September 19, 1963, the report of this Planning Board was considered and approved and by-law 311\/63 making the recommended variations in the zoning was given three readings. The meeting took place in the evening and again no notice whatsoever was given to Boyd Builders Limited of the intention to consider and rezone at such meeting, nor did any officer of Boyd Builders have any knowledge of it.\nImmediately thereafter, again, on the next day, September 20, 1963, an application was forwarded to the Municipal Board for the approval of the hastily enacted by-law, 311\/63. Although the City Clerk swears that he forwarded notice of such application for approval to \u201call owners of property in the City of Ottawa within the area affected by by-law 311\/63, and within 300 feet of such area\u201d, no such notice was received by the officers of Boyd Builders Limited. An officer of Boyd Builders Limited, however, heard of the enactment of this by-law and attending the municipal offices confirmed that fact. Boyd Builders Limited, therefore, prepared its application for the issue of mandamus. The application is dated September 30, 1963, and is supported by the affidavits of Joseph Liff sworn on September 27, 1963, and various affidavits of Ernest B. Colbert, the president, some sworn also on that date. On October 2, 1963, both H.M. MacFarland, an officer in the City Clerk\u2019s department, Mr. Hastey, the City Clerk, and W.J. Robertson, the secretary of the Ottawa Planning Board, refused to permit the applicant\u2019s representative to scrutinize or take copies of the minutes of either the meeting of the Planning Board or of council\nIn my view, a most telling circumstance occurred on September 19, 1963, when Mr. Colbert, the president of the respondent, conferred with the City Solicitor, Mr. Hambling, and delivered to him a letter of that date composed by his solicitor. Mr. Hambling conferred with Mr. McLean of the Building Inspector\u2019s office, and advised Mr. McLean that in his opinion a building permit could be issued. Nevertheless, Mr. McLean and Mr. Instance, the acting building inspector, refused to issue a permit because they had been instructed not to do so. Mr. Instance in the course of the cross-examination upon his affidavit, admitted that if by-law 311\/63 had not been enacted on September 19th and he had not received instructions from the Board of Control to withhold issuing a building permit he would have done so on that latter date.\nThe relevant cases may be summarized by stating the most important indicia of good faith in these matters are frankness and impartiality.\nWith respect, upon the circumstances outlined above, I adopt the conclusion of Roach J.A. in the Court of Appeal when he said:\nWhen on March 22, 1963, the City passed its zoning By-law 68\/63 it did not thereby prohibit the erection of an apartment building thereon; indeed it expressly permitted it. Accordingly when the appellant filed its application for the building permit it had a prima facie right to it. Up until then the Municipal Council had not manifested any intention of varying the then existing restrictions. In passing By-law 311\/63 the Council was not acting in good faith. It passed that by-law for the express purpose of defeating appellant\u2019s prima facie right to the permit. It yielded to the protests of some of the other owners in the immediate neighbourhood for whom the Planning Board was \u201csympathetic\u201d. It passed that by-law without any opportunity having been given to the appellant, which was so vitally interested, to make any representations concerning it. Everything that was done to defeat the appellant\u2019s prima facie right was done behind its back for the obvious purpose of avoiding embarrassment that the appellant\u2019s protestations on its own behalf might cause. It is difficult to think of any stronger evidence of bad faith, (The italicizing is my own.) I am, therefore, of the opinion that the appellant failed to manifest that it was proceeding on a pre-existing clear intention to restrict the lands in question and was acting in good faith in so doing.\nOne further matter should be referred to. The interesting question was proposed that if this appeal were dismissed and therefore the building inspector, in accordance with the judgment of the Court of Appeal, were required to and did issue the necessary building permit, and if hereafter the Ontario Municipal Board approved the by-law, No. 311\/63, then such approval would date back to the date of the by-law, i.e., September 19, 1963, and the result would be that the building inspector had been required by the court order to grant a building permit contrary to the provisions of the city by-law and moreover such permit might well be vain as the by-law, by virtue of s. 30(1) (ii) of The Planning Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 296, as amended, would not only prohibit the erection of the building but its use. There are two answers to such a submission. Firstly, it would not be expected that the Ontario Municipal Board would take such a course in light of the fact that on November 8, 1963, that board made an order directing that no further step should be taken in respect to the application for approval of the said by-law pending the final determination of Boyd Builders Limited application for a mandatory order. Therefore, one would expect the said Ontario Municipal Board to make no order approving the by-law in respect of the lands in question after the mandatory order requiring the issue of the building permit had been made by the Court of Appeal and confirmed by this Court.

This lease was still subsisting at the time of the hearing of the present appeal and during its term oil was discovered and production obtained. In 1951, one M, representing himself as an agent of the defendant company P, approached the plaintiff to discuss an option for another lease if the first lease should fall in. The plaintiff was induced to sign certain documents which he had not read. One was an agreement by which, inter alia, he purported to assign to P an undivided half interest in the petroleum, natural gas and related hydrocarbons in and under the lands, and further agreed to execute and deliver to the said company a registrable transfer of the said interest. Another document was a transfer under The Land Titles Act, R.S.S. 1953, c. 108, of an undivided half interest in all mines and minerals under the said land. The plaintiff also signed a receipt for $64. He admitted that he signed all three documents but denied any contemporaneous knowledge of the Land Titles transfer and also denied receipt of any money.\nM took all the documents away but did not ask for a certificate of title, without which the transfer could not be registered under The Land Titles Act. This certificate was not asked for until 1953 when another agent, one E, acting for the defendant company C, an assignee of the disputed interest, visited the plaintiff. The latter immediately consulted his solicitor and discovered what he had signed. Acting on his solicitor's advice, the plaintiff in 1954 executed another transfer under The Land Titles Act and made available his certificate of title for the purpose of registration of this transfer of an undivided half interest in all oil and gas. In 1958 the plaintiff brought an action for, inter alia, a declaration that everything that he had signed was null and void, and, in the alternative, for damages for deceit against the defendant P. The trial judge and a unanimous Court of Appeal held against both claims. The plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Spence J. dissenting in part): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Cartwright, Judson, Ritchie and Hall JJ.: At the time of signing the transfer in 1954 the plaintiff had full knowledge of what he had signed in 1951 and what he was then signing and why. As held by the Courts below, the second transfer, which was untainted by any fraud and was executed with full knowledge and by way of compromise of a real dispute, ruled out any declaration of nullity, rescission or any claim for damages.\nPer Spence J., dissenting: In so far as the action for rescission was concerned, the judgment of the Court of Appeal refusing such remedy was correct. It was unnecessary to determine whether the 1951 agreement was altogether void or simply voidable. Since the agreement could only be attacked by the plaintiff and unless so attacked always bound the defendant P, it would appear to have been voidable, although once the plaintiff established his plea of non est factum thereto, the contract was avoided as of its inception. Therefore, the plaintiff upon having been fully informed of the fraudulent representation which caused his execution of that contract, and fully advised by his solicitor of his rights when he chose to affirm the agreement rather than void it, was bound by that election and could not now obtain rescission. On the other hand, if the 1951 agreement were altogether void and not merely voidable, the plaintiff made a new agreement, for which there was consideration, in 1954 when all of the information as to the fraud and as to his rights had been furnished him by his solicitor.\nHowever, the right to take action for damages for deceit may still exist despite the loss of the right to take action for rescission. The issues upon which it was to be determined whether the plaintiff had lost this right were whether in executing the conveyance in 1954 and delivering the same to the defendant C he had entered into a compromise of that right or whether his conduct had estopped him from asserting it. On the evidence, it could not be concluded that any transaction between the plaintiff and the defendant C as represented by E and by its solicitors in 1953 and 1954 could have any effect as a compromise of a claim against P which arose in 1951 at the time the original documents were executed by the plaintiff.\nThe defendant P, when it permitted M to be armed with documents such as the assignment that he produced to the plaintiff, and when it undertook to have the titles to the petroleum and natural gas interest put in its name and caveats filed in its name, constituted M its agent for the purpose of obtaining such conveyances of petroleum and natural gas interests. Therefore, the defendant P was liable for the fraud or deceit of its agent.\n[Prudential Trust Co. Ltd. et al. v. Cugnet, [1956] S.C.R. 914; Clough v. London and North Western Railway Co.

Appeal dismissed, Spence J. dissenting in part.\nD. G. McLeod, Q.C., for the plaintiff, appellant.\nA. M. Nicol, Q.C., for the defendant, respondent, Prudential Trust.\nJ. L. McDougall, Q.C., for the defendant, respondent, Canadian Williston.\nJ. Stein, for the third parties.\nThe judgment of Cartwright, Judson, Ritchie and Hall JJ. was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014The plaintiff-appellant, James T. Pepper, seeks in this litigation to set aside certain transactions entered into in 1951 and 1954 the result of which was that he parted with an undivided one-half interest in all petroleum and natural gas under his farm. There is an alternative claim for damages for deceit against Prudential Trust Company Limited. The trial judge and a unanimous Court of Appeal have held against both claims.\nIn 1949, Pepper, as the owner of two quarter sections, had granted a lease of all petroleum, natural gas and related hydrocarbons to Rio Bravo Oil Company Limited, subject to payment of a royalty. This lease is still subsisting and during its term, oil was discovered and production obtained on the land.\nIn 1951, one Macdonald came to Pepper to discuss an option for another lease if the first lease should fall in. According to Pepper this was the only subject-matter of any discussion at any time with Macdonald. On the second visit, however, Macdonald came back with certain documents ready for signature. This time Pepper signed the following documents:\n(1) A document headed \"Assignment\". This document purported to\n(a) give an immediate assignment to Prudential Trust Company Limited of an undivided half interest in all petroleum, natural gas and related hydrocarbons in and under the lands; (b) promise that Pepper would execute a registrable transfer of this interest;\n(c) give an option for a new lease if the first lease should fall in.\n(2) A transfer under The Land Titles Act of an undivided half interest in all mines and minerals under the said land.\n(3) A receipt for $64.\nPepper admits that he signed all three documents but denies any contemporaneous knowledge of the Land Titles Transfer and also denies the receipt of any money. Macdonald took all the documents away but did not ask for a certificate of title, without which the transfer could not be registered under the Saskatchewan Land Titles Act.\nThis certificate was not asked for until 1953 when another agent, acting for Canadian Williston Minerals Ltd., an assignee of the disputed interest, visited Pepper. Pepper immediately consulted his solicitor and discovered what he had signed. On instructions from his solicitor, he searched his private papers at home and found that the first agent, Macdonald, had sent him back an executed copy of the assignment. It had been lying unopened among his papers for some time. After some discussion with his solicitor, and some delay, he executed in 1954 another transfer under The Land Titles Act and made available his certificate of title for the purpose of registration of this transfer of an undivided half interest in all oil and gas. It did not include \"related hydrocarbons\" and it departed from the terminology of \"all mines and minerals\" contained in the first transfer that he had signed for Macdonald. Pepper made this compromise on the advice of his solicitor, who did not think that the dispute was worth the risk of litigation.\nAt that time he had full knowledge of what he had signed in 1951 and what he was then signing and why. I wish it to be understood that I am not in any way criticising the solicitor. His client had signed a lot of documents and it is clear that at this time the oil and natural gas were not regarded as being of any significant value. The discovery of oil came later.\nIt should also be remembered that the case of Prudential Trust Co. Ltd. et al. v. Cugnet[2], had not been decided at that time. What the result would have been if Pepper had stood his ground in 1953 and resisted any further claim for the transfer, it is difficult to say. The transfer that he had first executed was not in accordance with the assignment. It was for an undivided half interest in mines and minerals. What he had apparently agreed to transfer was an undivided half interest in oil, gas and related hydrocarbons. Such a transfer would not be registrable under the practice of the Saskatchewan Land Titles Office. But he had agreed to execute a registrable transfer.\nPepper brought an action for a declaration that everything that he had signed was null and void. The trial judge would have held in his favour had it not been for his execution of the second transfer on his solicitor's advice. He held that this was an affirmance of the transaction and that it precluded him both from setting it aside and claiming damages.\nThe Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. They thought that the original documents were not a nullity, as found by the trial judge, but voidable on the ground of fraud. They were, however, in complete agreement with the trial judge that the second transfer ruled out any declaration of nullity, rescission or any claim for damages. With this I agree and I think that the appeal fails for the reasons given in both Courts on this aspect of the case.\nThe learned trial judge found that Pepper had established a plea of non est factum. The difference between the trial judge and the Court of Appeal concerned the consequences of such a successful plea\u2014the trial judge held that the transaction was a nullity whereas the Court of Appeal said that it was voidable at the option of plaintiff. I cannot see that this distinction governs the decision of this case. Both Courts held that the deciding factor was the second transfer, which was untainted by any fraud and was executed with full knowledge and by way of compromise of a real dispute. To them this was a complete settlement of every item of dispute. Pepper cannot now assert that notwithstanding the unimpeachable second transfer, he somehow held back a claim for damages if oil and gas should be subsequently discovered. As the Court of Appeal made clear, the claim for damages is precisely the same as the value of the property which he transferred by way of settlement.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs. SPENCE J. (dissenting in part):\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[3] affirming the judgment of Thomson J. at trial.\nThe plaintiff was the registered owner in fee simple of all mines and minerals within, upon and under a certain quarter section of land. By a petroleum and natural gas lease dated October 28, 1949, he had granted all petroleum, natural gas and related hydrocarbons to Rio Bravo Oil Company Limited subject to the payment of a gross royalty of one-eighth of the oil produced and saved from the said lands, one-eighth of the market value at the sale of gas sold or used off the premises and one-tenth in kind or value at the well on all other materials mined and marketed. This grant was for an indefinite term and was to continue for so long as production continued. Production of oil and gas was obtained in late 1957 and continued up to the time of the hearing of this appeal. By the provisions of the said petroleum and natural gas lease, either party had the right to assign his interest under the said lease.\nIn May of 1951, the plaintiff was approached by one Claude Macdonald. The plaintiff swore that Claude Macdonald stated to him that he represented the Prudential Trust Company, oil developers, and explained that the company he represented desired a first chance to obtain from the plaintiff a lease of his petroleum and natural gas on the same terms as those existing under the Rio Bravo Oils lease above mentioned except that the rental would be 25 cents per acre instead of 10 cents per acre and, of course, the proposed lease should only come into effect when the existing lease should lapse or expire.\nThe plaintiff testified that he agreed to give to Macdonald's principal such first chance and after further conversations he signed two documents, without reading the documents because, as he alleged, he trusted the said Macdonald who \"seemed to be a very nice man\". The documents so produced and signed by the plaintiff were, however, of a totally different kind and character from those which he testified he had agreed to sign. One was an agreement by which, inter alia, he purported to assign to Prudential Trust Company Limited an undivided one-half interest in the petroleum, natural gas and related hydrocarbons upon the lands, and further agreed to execute and deliver to the said company a registrable transfer of the said interest, and the other document was a transfer to the said company of an undivided one-half interest in all the mines and minerals within or upon the said lands except coal.\nThe trial judge found, as a fact, as follows:\nI am not overlooking his evidence, but after carefully reviewing all of the evidence I am convinced that when the plaintiff signed the documents which Mr. Macdonald produced to him for execution he had absolutely no idea that they were an agreement to sell or assign an interest in his petroleum, natural gas and related hydrocarbons and a transfer of an interest in his mines and minerals.\nI agree with the learned trial judge that if the matter had rested there the plaintiff's plea of non est factum would have been a good plea and the plaintiff would have been entitled to claim rescission of the agreement and transfer on the basis that the same were invalid as not having been his act and deed. I need quote no further authority for that proposition than the decision of this Court in Prudential Trust Co. Ltd. et al. v. Cugnet[4]. However, in 1953, one Marty Erickson who stated himself to be, and who evidently was, a representative of the defendant Canadian Williston Minerals Ltd., attended the plaintiff and demanded from him delivery of the duplicate certificate of title to his land so that the aforesaid transfer of the one-half interest could be registered. The plaintiff then took the position that he had never entered into any agreement doing more than granting to the Prudential Trust Company a right to lease the lands upon the Rio Bravo lease lapsing. The plaintiff told Mr. Erickson that he wished to confer with his solicitor, a Mr. N. R. McDonald, Q.C., of Weyburn, and obtain his advice as to what he should do. The plaintiff immediately attended Mr. McDonald, Q.C., and on his arrival at the latter's office found Mr. Erickson there ahead of him.\nThe learned trial judge has found that the situation was then fully explained to Mr. McDonald by Mr. Erickson and that the plaintiff in turn was fully advised as to the nature and effect of the documents which he had delivered to Claude Macdonald, purporting to represent the Prudential Trust Company Ltd. in 1951.\nMr. N. R. McDonald, Q.C., then advised the plaintiff, and he has so admitted, that he, the plaintiff, would save trouble and expense if he complied with the demand that was made upon him. Mr. N. R. McDonald, Q.C., however, pointed out that the assignment dated May 2, 1951, purported to assign a one-half interest in all oil and gas and related hydrocarbons, and that it was then the prevailing legal opinion in Saskatchewan that a document referring to \"related hydrocarbons\" could not be registered under the Land Titles System. Mr. N. R. McDonald, Q.C., further pointed out that the transfer executed in 1951 by the plaintiff was of an interest in all mines and minerals except coal, and that therefore it did not comply with the agreement to assign in the assignment dated May 2, 1951, and last referred to. After a considerable interval of time and some correspondence between Mr. N. R. McDonald, Q.C., and the legal representatives of the defendant Canadian Williston Minerals Ltd., Mr. N. R. McDonald, Q.C., caused the plaintiff to execute a transfer dated August 4, 1954, which transfer purported to convey an undivided one-half interest in all petroleum and natural gas on the said lands. This transfer Mr. McDonald, Q.C., delivered to the defendant Canadian Williston Company.\nThe affidavit of value attached to the said transfer sets out the sum of $80 but it is admitted by the defendant Canadian Williston Minerals Ltd. that no such payment was made and that this amount of $80 was one and the same amount that they were advised had been paid to the plaintiff on the original transaction. The plaintiff had testified that he received no money whatsoever from Claude Macdonald at the time he executed the documents in 1951. A receipt produced at trial as Exhibit D-1 was shown to him and he acknowledged that the signature in pencil thereon appeared to be his signature but he swore that he had never used a pencil to sign a document. Mr. Claude Macdonald, however, in giving his evidence, had sworn that he did make in cash the payment evidenced by such receipt.\nThe plaintiff commenced this action in May of 1958, claiming therein, inter alia, a declaration that the transfer was void and for an order vesting the petroleum and natural gas in the name of the plaintiff, an order removing the caveat filed against the lands by the defendant Prudential Trust Company, and in the alternative, for damages for deceit against the defendant Prudential Trust Company Limited. In so far as the action for rescission is concerned, I am of the opinion, with respect, that the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan refusing such remedy is correct. It would appear that it is unnecessary to determine whether the original agreement of May 2, 1951, was altogether void or simply voidable. Since the agreement could only be attacked by the plaintiff and unless so attacked always bound the defendant Prudential Trust Company, it would appear to have been voidable, although once the plaintiff established his plea of non est factum thereto, the contract was avoided as of its inception. Therefore, the plaintiff upon having been fully informed of the fraudulent representation which caused his execution of that contract, and fully advised by his solicitor of his rights when he chose to affirm the agreement rather than void it, is bound by that election and cannot now obtain rescission: Clough v. London and North Western Railway Company[5], at p. 34, and Barron v. Kelly[6], per Anglin J. at pp. 478-9, and Brodeur J. at p. 487.\nOn the other hand, if the agreement of May 2, 1951, were altogether void and not merely voidable, the plaintiff made a new agreement in 1954 when all of the information as to the fraud and as to his rights had been furnished him by his solicitor. The consideration for that new agreement may be found in the forbearance of the defendant Canadian Williston from engaging the plaintiff in litigation and further in the result of the new agreement that the plaintiff retained the related hydrocarbons and all mines and minerals except oil and natural gas. In so far as the mines and minerals except natural gas are concerned, it is probable that the transfer delivered in May 1951 not being in accordance with the assignment would have been subject to rectification but that in itself would have entailed litigation. The omission, however, of \"related hydrocarbons\" is a variation from the original alleged invalid assignment of May 1951 and even if a document containing those words had not been subject to registration under The Land Titles Act, the agreement, if valid, would have bound the parties thereto. We were informed during argument in this Court that there may well have been a value in such related hydrocarbons.\nThere is no doubt, however, that the right to take action for damages for deceit may still exist despite the loss of the right to take action for rescission: Barron v. Kelly, supra. The issues upon which it must be determined whether the plaintiff has lost this right are whether in executing the conveyance of August 1954 and delivering the same to the defendant Canadian Williston Company he has entered into a compromise of that right or whether his conduct has estopped him from asserting it. In Barron v. Kelly, the plaintiff's solicitor, in forwarding further payments to the defendant after the plaintiff had discovered the fraud, wrote:\nI have further to advise you that although Mr. Barron is completing his purchase rather than lose the money already paid on the purchase price before he learned of the false and fraudulent representations made to induce him to purchase, he does not waive his right to insist on reparation for the deceit practised upon him, and proposes to bring an action on account thereof.\nIt may be argued that the plaintiff represented as he was by his solicitor, Mr. N. R. McDonald, Q.C., in 1953 and 1954, upon executing the transfer of August 1954 and causing it to be forwarded to the defendant Canadian Williston Company, should have had his solicitor advise the defendant in terms to the same effect as those used above. It may, of course, also be argued that the defendant Canadian Williston was effectively represented by legal advisers and had it been intended that the plaintiff upon executing the transfer should release all his claims of any kind, it was quite within that defendant's power to require the execution of a release in proper form.\nNot only did the defendant Canadian Williston Company not require such release but the defendant Canadian Williston did not deliver to the plaintiff or to his solicitor the assignment of May 2, 1951, which had been acquired by the original alleged fraud. This document was produced by the defendant upon the examination de bene esse of the agent Claude Macdonald held in Toronto. It should be noted that that document had, in addition to the covenants granting a transfer of the mineral rights, i.e., the covenants which were alleged to have been fraudulently inserted, an option to the defendant Prudential Trust Company of a 99-year petroleum and natural gas lease upon the plaintiff's lands when the existing lease should lapse, i.e., the only covenant which the plaintiff has testified he thought he was executing. Although neither defendant has since 1954 asserted any right under that agreement of May 2, 1951, there has been no occasion to do so. I am of the opinion that counsel for the appellant (plaintiff) in this Court rightly argued that the failure to deliver that document to his client in August 1954 is evidence of considerable weight that no compromise was intended.\nThe evidence of Mr. N. R. McDonald, Q.C., on the question of a possible compromise or release of claims is enlightening Mr. McDonald, Q.C., testified that the only reason for the variation in the form of the transfer between that executed by the plaintiff in 1951 and the one executed in 1954, was because he had pointed out to the plaintiff that the term \"mines and minerals\" included more than the term \"petroleum and natural gas\" and that his purpose was to make the transfer conform with the original agreement to that extent. This question was put to him:\nQ. Well, specifically, was there any discussion of a release for any claim that Pepper might have against the companies or either of them?\nAnd Mr. McDonald replied: \"Oh no.\" And to a further question:\nAs I understand you then, Mr. McDonald, the sole purpose in executing and delivering a new transfer was to bring the transfer, the document of conveyance, in conformity with the original agreement, Exhibit P.2?\nMr. McDonald replied:\nThat is right, to enable Canadian Williston to effect registration.\nThe plaintiff testified in cross-examination that when he executed the document in 1954 he was not thinking about claiming damages and did not consider that subject until he found that many other persons were similarly involved. It would appear that the plaintiff came to this opinion in November 1956 when he joined an association known as the Mineral Owners' Protective Association.\nThese questions and answers are relevant:\nBy Mr. Nicol:\nQ. For better than two years you were sure that you had settled your own case? A. Yes, I knew I had settled that, I knew that, but then I wasn't satisfied with it after I had found out so many were in it.\nQ. When you talked to your friends in the Mineral Owners Protective Association, then you decided that the settlement you had made was no good, is that it? A. No, I didn't figure it was no good, but I didn't see that these men should go around through the country points and take what us old people had made during our lifetime. Upon the whole of the evidence, I am of the view that even as between the plaintiff and the defendant Canadian Williston there was no discussion of any compromise or mutual release and no intention by either that this transaction should constitute a compromise or mutual release. Moreover, although Claude Macdonald in 1951 had represented himself as being the agent of the defendant Prudential Trust Company Limited, Mr. Erickson in 1954 only represented himself as agent for the defendant Canadian Williston. Mr. N. R. McDonald, Q.C.'s dealings were with Canadian Williston alone and the Prudential Trust Company did not know of the existence of either the 1951 assignment and transfer or the 1954 transfer until it was called upon to execute a transfer of all petroleum and natural gas rights which it held as trustee for the defendant Canadian Williston. This document was dated September 22, 1955. Mr. George Douglas Ash, the manager of the defendant Prudential Trust Company, Calgary Branch, in cross-examination, was asked:\nQ. Yes. And was there any suggestion made to you that in some fashion there had been some kind of a settlement made on behalf of the Prudential Trust Company by somebody? A. Not to my knowledge, no.\nQ. No. So that as far as your Company is concerned, you have never had\u2014you had no knowledge of the matters in dispute in this action until the action was commenced? A. That's right.\nI, therefore, am unable to conclude that any transaction between the plaintiff and the defendant Canadian Williston as represented by Mr. Erickson and by its solicitors in 1953 and 1954 could have any effect as a compromise of a claim against the defendant Prudential Trust Company which arose in May 1951 at the time the original documents were executed by the plaintiff.\nThe alternative claim for the damages for deceit is made against the defendant Prudential Trust Company Limited alone. One of the defences against such claim as submitted by counsel for the defendant Prudential Trust Company was that Claude Macdonald was never its employee or agent. It would appear that a group of persons and probably the third parties Edward P. Lamar and Bueno Oils Ltd. had entered into a plan for acquiring interests in lands which might have in or under them oil or natural gas, and that for that purpose it sent around the countryside various agents including the said Claude Macdonald. Edward P. Lamar and the defendant Prudential Trust Company had entered into an agreement entitled Deed of Indemnity on November 1, 1950. This agreement was produced at trial as Exhibit D-3. Under that agreement the Prudential Trust Company covenanted to act as trustee for Lamar's interest and on Lamar's instructions and at his expense to file caveats in the name of a trustee to protect Lamar's interest and to take any and all proceedings necessary to protect or enforce his interests. Lamar covenanted in the said agreement to indemnify the Prudential Trust Company from all liability incurred by reason of its having acted on his behalf which might result from the filing of the caveats or accepting any registrable title or \"by reason of all actions, suits, proceedings whatsoever\". On September 22, 1955, when the Prudential Trust Company conveyed to Canadian Williston all the interests it had held as base trustee it obtained a similar covenant of indemnification from the latter. Although the Prudential Trust Company did not print the form of assignment which was tendered to the plaintiff for execution in May of 1951 by Claude Macdonald, it knew of the existence of that most deceptive form of document. It had had complaints prior to that date and in fact prior to that date had insisted on the drafting of a new form entitled not merely \"Assignment\" but \"Assignment of an undivided one-half interest in mines and minerals\". The form presented in May 1951, and produced at trial as Exhibit P-2, purports in the printed words to be an assignment to the \"Prudential Trust Company Limited of the City of Calgary in the Province of Alberta (hereinafter called the \"Assignee\")\".\nThe plaintiff swore that when Claude Macdonald came to him he said \"I am representing the Prudential Trust Company, Prudential Trust Oil Company \u2026\". Claude Macdonald was examined de bene esse and testified that he would purchase petroleum and natural gas rights in the name of the Prudential Trust Company and that the documents were always taken in the name of the Prudential Trust Company.\nI am ready to hold that the defendant Prudential Trust Company Limited, when it permitted Claude Macdonald to be armed with documents such as the assignment, Exhibit P-2, in form which I have outlined, and when it undertook to have the titles to the petroleum and natural gas interest put in its name and caveats filed in its name, constituted Claude Macdonald its agent for the purpose of obtaining such conveyances of petroleum and natural gas interests. Therefore, the defendant Prudential Trust Company is liable for the fraud or deceit of its agent.\nKerr on Fraud and Mistake, 7th ed., at p. 492, said:\nA principal is liable to third persons for frauds, deceits, concealments, torts, and omissions of duty of his agent, when acting in the course of his employment, although the principal did not authorise or justify or participate in, or indeed know of such misconduct, or even if he forbade the acts or disapproved of them.\nI have therefore come to the conclusion that despite the fact that the plaintiff's action for rescission is barred, he is entitled to recover damages against the defendant Prudential Trust Company Limited for deceit.\nTurning to the quantum of such damages, there is a sparsity of evidence in the record of the trial. A witness, Robert S. Blackett, was called by the plaintiff to give expert evidence as to the quantum of damages, and the defendant Prudential Trust Company Limited called another expert, Peter B. Watkins, for such purpose. It would appear from an examination of the evidence of each of them that they did not differ greatly in their estimate of the damages which, of course, must be the present value of the undivided one-half interest in the royalties payable under the Rio Bravo lease.\nTaking the evidence of Mr. Watkins, which cannot be viewed as being unfavourable to the defendant who called him, that sum would appear to be $140,100. Such amount includes the royalties which were payable from the commencement of the drilling by Rio Bravo Oil Company in 1957 up to the date of the trial. It does not appear in the record whether the plaintiff received the full 12 1\/2 per cent of the royalties during the whole or any part of that period, or whether he received only one-half, i.e., 6 1\/4 per cent.\nI therefore am of the opinion that there should be judgment for the plaintiff for the sum of $140,100 but subject to the proviso that the defendant Prudential Trust Company may, at its option to be exercised within two months from the date of this judgment, proceed to a reference before the proper officer of the Court of Queen's Bench for the Province of Saskatchewan, the costs of such reference to be paid by such defendant if it should result in an assessment of damages at or above the said sum of $140,100 but otherwise by the plaintiff.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, SPENCE J. dissenting in part.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Pedersen, Norman, McLeod, Miller & Bertram, Regina.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent, Prudential Trust: Nicol, Keith, Armstrong, MacDonald and Cruickshank, Regina.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent, Canadian Williston: McDougall, Ready & Hodges, Regina.\nSolicitors for the third parties: MacPherson, Leslie & Tyerman, Regina.\n[1] (1963), 45 W.W.R. 275, 41 D.L.R.

Appeals dismissed.\nC.L. Dubin, Q.C., and H.L. Morphy, for the appellants.\nJ.J. Robinette, Q.C., and L.S. Geiger, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014These two appeals, the first of which is brought pursuant to special leave granted by this Court, were argued together.\nThe first appeal arises out of an action in which the appellants as plaintiffs claimed in the endorsement on the writ of summons, as amended:\n(a) A declaration that the General Regulations 1963-64 made by The Ontario Flue-Cured Tobacco Growers\u2019 Marketing Board on May 6th, 1963, exceed the powers delegated to it by the Farm Products Marketing Board by Regulation 173 of the Revised Regulations of Ontario, 1960 as amended by Ontario Regulation 107\/63, Ontario Regulation 108\/63, and Ontario Regulation 125\/63, made pursuant to the Farm Products Marketing Act, R.S.O. 1960, Chapter 137, as amended by Statutes of Ontario, 1961-62, Chapter 41 and Statutes of Ontario 1962-63, Chapter 45,\n(b) Alternatively for a declaration that Sections 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9,10 and 13, either in whole or in part of General Regulations 1963-64 made by The Ontario Flue-Cured Tobacco Growers\u2019 Marketing Board on May 6th, 1963, exceed the powers delegated to it by the Farm Products Marketing Board by regulation 173 of the Revised Regulations of Ontario 1960 as amended by Ontario Regulation 107\/63, Ontario Regulation 108\/63, and Ontario Regulation 125\/63 made pursuant to the Farm Products Marketing Act, R.S.O. 1960, Chapter 137 as amended by Statutes of Ontario 1961-62 Chapter 41 and Statutes of Ontario, 1962-63 Chapter 45.\nThey also claimed consequential relief by way of interlocutory and permanent injunctions. A further claim set out in the endorsement alleging that the respondent Board was not duly constituted was abandoned. The second appeal arises out of an application made by the appellants by way of originating notice for an order by way of mandamus directing the respondent Board to:\n1. Issue a licence to produce tobacco to the applicants for the year 1963;\n2. Establish and record a 1963 basic tobacco acreage to the applicants;\n3. Fix and allot 1963 quotas for the marketing of tobacco to the applicants;\nand for such further and other relief as may seem just under the circumstances.\nAn application for an interlocutory injunction made in the action came on for hearing before Grant J. at the same time as the application for a mandamus and, with the consent of all parties, was turned into a motion for judgment. The two applications were argued together on July 30, and August 2, 1963, and judgment was reserved. On October 9, 1963, judgment was given dismissing the action and the application for mandamus.\nAppeals taken to the Court of Appeal for Ontario were dismissed at the conclusion of the argument on February 10, 1964[2].\nThe appeals to this Court from the judgments of the Court of Appeal were argued together on March 18 and 19, 1965. At the opening of the argument the question was raised whether the Court should entertain the appeals in view of the circumstances that the mandamus asked for could not now be effective as it related to matters to be done in the year 1963 and the regulations attacked in the action have been replaced by other regulations similarly, but not identically, worded. This preliminary question was reserved and counsel for the appellants and the respondent were heard on the merits of the appeals.\nHaving considered the arguments of counsel and the authorities to which they referred I find myself in agreement with the conclusion and the reasons of Grant J. and also with those of the Court of Appeal. I do not think that anything would be gained by attempting to summarize or re-state those reasons and am content to adopt them. Having reached this conclusion it becomes unnecessary to give further consideration to the preliminary objection.\nIn the result I would dismiss both appeals with costs but, in view of the appeals having been argued together, would direct, as did the Court of Appeal, that only one counsel fee be allowed to cover the two appeals.\nAppeals dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Weingust & Halman, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Fleming, Harris, Kerwin, Barr & Hildebrand, St. Catharines.\n[1] [1964] 1 O.R. 653, 43 D.L.R.

The defendant took the position that the deceased did not die from bodily injury caused by accident within the meaning of the terms of the policy as originally issued or as subsequently extended by a rider. The deceased had suffered a heart attack in the spring of 1961 and after a period of hospitalization and recuperation had returned to work with instructions to restrict his activities. On September 29, 1961, accompanied by a friend, he went on a hunting trip in his automobile. Blowing snow and ice were encountered and the car became stuck in a snowdrift. The friend shovelled and pushed while the deceased attempted to help by rocking the car, i.e., by shifting alternately from forward to reverse gear. While thus engaged, the deceased suffered a coronary thrombosis and occlusion causing his death. The trial judgment in favour of the deceased's widow was reversed by the Court of Appeal and an appeal was then brought to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe exertion of driving and handling the steering wheel of the automobile and, at the last, of rocking the automobile by alternately shifting from forward to reverse gear was not an accident but deliberate and, there- fore, the loss was not caused by accident as required by the policy.

Rees, Q.C., for the plaintiff, appellant.\nJ.L. Robertson, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nHALL J.:\u2014By a policy of accident insurance issued October 9, 1950, the respondent insured one Daniel Wilfred Smith in the principal sum of $1,000 against, inter alia, loss of his life by:\nloss resulting solely from Bodily Injury which is not caused by and does not arise out of nor in the course of any employment for compensation, wage, profit or gain, and which is sustained during the life of this policy through Accidental Bodily Injury (Suicide, or any attempt thereat, sane or insane, not included) \u2026..\nA rider to this policy effective July 1, 1959, insured Smith in the sum of $10,000 against loss of his life from:\nbodily injury caused by an accident occurring anywhere in the world while this rider and the policy to which it is attached are in force and resulting directly and independently of all other causes in death of the Insured within 90 days of the date of the accident provided the accident causing such injury of the insured is in consequence of the Insured:\nA. Riding as a passenger or operator in or on, boarding or alighting from, or being struck by an automobile\u2026..\nDaniel Wilfred Smith died on September 29, 1961, under the circumstances later set out. The respondent admitted that Smith's death occurred while the policy was in force and that the appellant, the widow of the deceased Smith is the beneficiary named in the policy. The respondent took the position that the deceased did not die from bodily injury caused by accident within the meaning of the terms of the policy as originally issued or as extended by the rider of July 1,1959.\nThe deceased who was 47 years of age at the time of his death was a welder by trade. For about 18 months prior to his death he was employed at the University of Saskatchewan. In April or May 1961 he suffered a heart attack. His condition was then diagnosed by Dr. Lewis Brand, who had been his physician for some eight to nine years, as a coronary occlusion. He was hospitalized for about two weeks and treated for this condition. After being discharged from hospital, he remained at home recuperating for about a month before returning to work. When he returned to work he did so with instructions from Dr. Brand not to do any heavy work such as lifting and not to climb flights of stairs except slowly one at a time with a rest between each step.\nThe events of September 29, 1961, prior to the death of the deceased are set out fully in the judgment of Maguire J.A. in his judgment as follows:\nOn the morning of September 29, 1961, Smith, accompanied by a friend Wright, left his home in Saskatoon by automobile, on a duck shooting expedition, for the area east of Cudworth, Saskatchewan. Some blowing snow and ice were encountered on the road which became progressively heavier towards Cudworth. In that area the deceased drove eastward on a municipal road, encountering snow drifts which at first caused no particular difficulty. Near the crest of a small hill a much deeper drift was run into, which stopped the car, but without any sudden jar or shock. The deceased found he was unable to proceed through the drift or to back out of it. He remained at the wheel and after Wright had shovelled and pushed for about three-quarters of an hour, they got the car out of the drift, but in so doing found it necessary to drive off of the road into the adjoining field. There they stopped for tea. Here the car again became stuck and it took about one or one and one-half hours of manoeuvring as well as further shovelling and pushing by Wright, to get the car back on the road. When the car was back on the road, it was facing west. The deceased then suggested to Wright, who had done all the shovelling and pushing, that he should take a rest. While Wright was resting, the deceased walked some distance east to view the road conditions. On his return to the car it was agreed it was not feasible to go any further east and that they should return home.\nIn order to proceed west there was about forty yards to go to get clear of the snow. Wright resumed shovelling and pushing and the deceased attempted to help by rocking the car, that is, rapidly changing gears from forward to reverse. In rocking the car the deceased moved his body back and forth in union with the movement of the car. It was while engaged in this activity that the deceased suffered a coronary thrombosis and occlusion causing his death. It is to be noted that the deceased during all this time, approximately, three hours, did no heavy work such as shovelling snow or pushing the car. Apart from the walk to ascertain the road conditions, all he did was drive the car.\nAn autopsy was performed on November 2, 1961, 34 days after death, and the pathologist, Dr. E. J. Andres, concluded:\nDeath was due to repeated coronary thromboses. The terminal thrombosis was initiated by haemorrhage into an atheroma which had ruptured into the lumen of the right coronary artery. This was the immediate cause of death. The medical testimony, based on the autopsy, was to the following effect:\n(1) that the heart showed that the deceased had suffered two previous coronary thromboses with resultant myocardial infarction;\n(2) that substantial recovery had been made from these earlier thromboses;\n(3) that the deceased suffered from atherosclerosis;\n(4) that said prior thromboses and the disease predisposed the deceased to further coronary thromboses;\n(5) that the sequence of development of the fatal occlusion was,\n(a) rupture of and haemorrhage into the atheroma;\n(b) rupture or breaking of the roof of the atheroma and haemorrhage into the lumen or passageway of the artery;\n(c) the forming of the thrombosis;\n(d) occlusion of the artery and death as a result.\nAll the medical witnesses called by the appellant were agreed that (b), (c) and (d) were probably sudden, involving little lapse of time; that (a), in point of time, could be relatively short but might take up to three hours before (b) occurred and with a possibility that it might have commenced early that morning before the deceased left his home.\nOther testimony by each of the three physicians was in substantial accord, and, in brief, to the following effect: the prior thromboses predisposed the deceased to further such attack or attacks and such could be produced spontaneously without apparent immediate cause or be induced by performing work; the disease of atherosclerosis was an underlying cause, the thrombosis being the end effect of the disease; that strain or stress in driving an automobile could induce the thrombosis.\nThe appellant's contention is that being stuck in the snow, the difficulties experienced in getting going and, finally, the rocking action in trying to free the automobile by shifting alternately from forward to reverse gear caused the deceased to become emotionally upset, resulting in a rise in his blood pressure which triggered the rupture or breaking of the roof of the atheroma and haemorrhage into the lumen or passageway of the artery; the forming of the thrombosis; occlusion of the artery and death as a result.\nAssuming that the deceased did become emotionally upset with a consequent rise in blood pressure with the results just mentioned, the question is, would that constitute an accident resulting directly and independently of all other causes in death within the meaning of the insuring clauses in the policy and in the rider.\nAn \"accident\" is defined in Welford on Accident Insurance, 2nd ed., p. 268, as:\nThe word \"accident\" involves the idea of something fortuitous and unexpected, as opposed to something proceeding from natural causes; and injury caused by accident is to be regarded as the antithesis to bodily infirmity caused by disease in the ordinary course of events.\nA like definition is found in Murray's Oxford Dictionary, vol. 1, p. 55.\nMany cases were cited by counsel, including a number of workmen's compensation cases. Workmen's compensation cases are not ordinarily applicable in the interpretation of a policy such as we have here: Fenton v. Thorley & Co., Ltd.[2]\nIn my opinion the judgment of Sheppard J.A. in Columbia Cellulose Co. Ltd. et al. v. Continental Casualty Co.[3] , which was affirmed without written reasons by this Court[4] , is conclusive against the position taken by the appellant. The facts in the Cellulose case were that one Eugene Bartlett, employed as plant manager by Columbia Cellulose Co. Ltd. at Prince Rupert, British Columbia and at their plant on Watson Island, British Columbia, left Prince Rupert on Friday, April 3, 1959, on an inspection tour of plants of the Cellulose Corporation of America in the vicinity of Charlotte, North Carolina, U.S.A. On Sunday, April 5, 1959, he arrived in Charlotte; on Monday, April 6, he inspected the Rockhill plant; on Tuesday, April 7, the plant at Charlotte and in the afternoon of that day he drove to the Narrows. On Wednesday, April 8, he inspected the Narrows plant, including the power house in which the temperature was as high as 120\u00b0-125\u00b0. That evening he returned to Charlotte, North Carolina. Later that evening Bartlett became ill, was taken to the hospital and at 12:30 a.m. the following morning he died. The plaintiff company, and Emerald Bartlett as executrix of the estate of the late Eugene Bartlett, brought action under a policy issued by the defendant to the plaintiff company insuring all eligible persons including Eugene Bartlett against\nbodily injury caused by an accident\u2026 and resulting directly and independently of all other causes. After trial, the learned trial judge dismissed the action and from that judgment the plaintiffs appealed.\nOn appeal the principal argument was whether or not the death of Bartlett was \"caused by an accident\" and therefore within the policy definition of \"injury\". The plaintiffs contended that Bartlett, unknown to himself, was suffering from fatty deposits in the coronary artery (atherosclerosis) producing a plaque or roughened elevation of the lining of the coronary artery, and that the exercise of the trip and the inspections caused a haemorrhage of the tissues under the lining of the artery, which haemorrhage raised the plaque thereby narrowing the bore of the artery and so affected the flow of blood as to have resulted in the formation of a clot or thrombosis. That blocking of the passage of blood to a portion of the heart so affected the heart that death followed.\nHaving reviewed the facts, Sheppard J.A. referred to the definition of \"accident\" quoted above, and proceeded to say at pp. 359-360:\nThe difficulty arises in applying the definition, that is, to determine whether \"accident\" under a particular policy relates to the cause or to the consequence. Under this policy the event insured against, namely \"a bodily injury caused by an accident\" consists of three parts: (1) A bodily injury; (2) An accident; and (3) That the accident cause the bodily injury. Under the policy there must be an accident which caused the bodily injury and therefore the accident must be distinct and separate from that bodily injury so as to be the cause thereof. On the literal meaning of the policy the accident must be the cause of the injury; it is not sufficient that the injury, that is the consequence, be an accident.\nThe plaintiffs' case is that the inspection of plants amounted to an over-exertion which caused a haemorrhage resulting in the raising of the plaque, the clot, the blocking of the artery and Bartlett's death. The evidence reads:\nMR WALLACE: I ask the Doctor to make that assumption that there was over-exertion.\nTHE COURT: And I just point out it is a very important assumption and it must be the premise upon which all of his evidence as to medical results must depend, is that not so, Doctor? A. Yes. I would respectfully say that that is for your lordship to say.\nQ. Yes, but I mean you are basing your opinion upon an assumption that the exertion described by the witness, Cotsford, was abnormal in the case of this particular patient? A. I am, sir.\nMR. WALLACE: Q. Now I want to deal with this question of exertion, Doctor. What relationship does it bear to this phenomena that you have described? A. Unusual exertion raises the blood pressure in the coronary arteries and intimal haemorrhage or subintimal haemorrhage-in other words, bleeding of a small capillary, small blood vessel which branches from the coronary artery in the wall of the heart. This characteristically occurs in people who have this underlying condition, as almost all males do in our civilization.\nThe exertion would be deliberate and not an accident; only the injury, that is the consequence, at the most would be an accident. Hence the plaintiffs' case is that the wilful act of exertion, which was no accident, has caused an unexpected consequence which is said to be an accident, but that is the reverse of what the policy requires.\nand at p. 366:\nThe injury complained of here is the haemorrhage and the consequences caused by the exertion, but the exertion was not an accident but deliberate and, therefore, the loss was not caused by accident as required by the policy.\nIn the present case the exertion of driving and handling the steering wheel of the automobile and, at the last, of rocking the automobile by alternately shifting from forward to reverse gear was deliberate and, in the words of Sheppard J.A. just quoted \"the loss was not caused by accident as required by the policy\".\nThe appeal should, therefore, be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Rees, Shmigelsky & Angene, Saskatoon.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Moxon, Schmitt, Estey, Robertson & Muzyka, Saskatoon.\n[1] (1964), 48 W.W.R. 25, 45 D.L.R.

(Defendants) Respondents.\n1965: March 4; 1965: April 6.\nPresent: Cartwright, Martland, Judson, Hall and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA, APPELLATE DIVISION\nMortgages\u2014Guarantee\u2014Mortgage on land and buildings\u2014Collateral mortgage on chattels\u2014Whether collateral chattel mortgage unenforceable as being an infringement of s. 34(17) of The Judicature Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 164\u2014Liability of guarantor\u2014The Guarantees Acknowledgment Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 136.\nThe plaintiff sued the defendant hotel company on two mortgages for foreclosure or sale. One mortgage was on the land and buildings and the other on chattels. The individual defendant S was sued as guarantor of these mortgages. The trial judge gave judgment against the corporate defendant for foreclosure or sale and against S for the full amount owing under the guarantee. The Appellate Division, by a majority, dismissed the appeal but varied the judgment against S to provide that he should only be liable for the deficiency after the security had been realized. The defendants appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe taking of security on chattels did not offend in any way against the restriction in s. 34(17) of The Judicature Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 164, of the right of the mortgagee to the land. He was seeking to enforce his security on chattels outside the terms of s. 34(17). He was enforcing his security on the land and he was enforcing his security on the chattels. In neither case was he attempting to get a personal judgment either directly or indirectly.\nThe submission that S was under no liability as guarantor since, under s. 34(17) (a), there was no debt owing by the principal debtor failed. There was a borrowing which was neither illegal nor ultra vires and there was an unenforceable debt which would not disappear by the terms of s. 34(18) until a vesting order was made. As to the ground that the certificate required by s. 4 of The Guarantees Acknowledgment Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 136, contained the name of the hotel company rather than that of S, the plain and unmistakable meaning of the certificate was that S knew and understood what obligations he was incurring in executing the guarantee of the recited mortgage and this was compliance with the Act. The defence that any guarantee of any mortgage indebtedness was void under the terms of s. 34(17) as an indirect method of attempting to impose personal liability under the mortgage also failed.\nThe guarantor was liable on his guarantee and his liability in no way depended upon the fact that his guarantee contained a waiver of the provisions of s. 34(17) of The Judicature Act. No opinion was expressed on the question whether a person entitled to the benefit of the Act could waive its provisions. A guarantor was not so entitled.\nSwan v. Bank of Scotland (1836), 10 Bli.

Judgment was given against both defendants in accordance with the claim. The Appellate Division[2] dismissed the defendants' appeal and they now appeal to this Court. We are not concerned here with the rights of certain lienholders who were brought into the litigation.\nSuperstein was the owner of a parcel of land and applied to Credit Foncier for a loan to assist in the construction of a hotel. The loan was to be for $300,000 with interest at 8 per cent, and was to extend over a period of 10 years. Edmonton Airport Hotel Co. Ltd. was to be incorporated to take title to the land and 10 per cent of the shares of the company were to be given to Credit Foncier. The hotel company was to give a charge under The Land Titles Act on the land and buildings and a chattel mortgage on all furnishings and equipment. Superstein was to give a personal guarantee of the loan. These securities were duly delivered, together with 15 per cent of the shares of the company, the extra 5 per cent being in consideration of an immediate advance of $50,000 to release the land from a charge held by a bank. Credit Foncier started its action after there had been default in payment of principal, interest, taxes and insurance premiums and failure to clear the property of mechanics' liens which had been filed. The company's defence was that the chattel mortgage was unenforceable as being an infringement of s. 34(17) of The Judicature Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 164. Superstein set up the same defence against the enforcement of his guarantee. In addition, he said that the guarantee was a nullity because it was not correctly certified in accordance with The Guarantees Acknowledgment Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 136. The trial judge gave judgment against the hotel company for foreclosure or sale and against Superstein for the full amount owing under the guarantee. The Appellate Division, by a majority, dismissed the appeal but varied the judgment against Superstein to provide that he should only be liable for the deficiency after the security had been realized. There is no appeal from this variation. The dissenting reasons of Johnson J.A., concurred in by Porter J.A., would have allowed the appeal and dismissed the action against both defendants.\nSections 34(17) (a) and 34(18) of The Judicature Act read as follows:\n34. (17) In an action brought upon a mortgage of land whether legal or equitable, or upon an agreement for the sale of land, the right of the mortgagee or vendor thereunder is restricted to the land to which the mortgage or agreement relates and to foreclosure of the mortgage or cancellation of the agreement for sale, as the case may be, and no action lies\n(a) on a covenant for payment contained in any such mortgage or agreement for sale.\n34. (18) \u2026and upon the making of any such vesting order or cancellation order, every right of the mortgagee or vendor for the recovery of any money whatsoever under and by virtue of the mortgage or agreement for sale in either case ceases and determines.\nThe first question that arises under this legislation is the company's defence that where a mortgage of land is involved, a collateral chattel mortgage for the same indebtedness or part of it is necessarily void because in an action upon a mortgage of land, the right of the mortgagee thereunder (i.e., the mortgage of land) is restricted to the land, and that to enforce the security of the chattel mortgage would be another way of enforcing personal liability on the covenant to pay. In my opinion, which coincides with that of the trial judge and the majority in the Appellate Division, this submission was rejected by this Court in Krook et al. v. Yewchuk et al.[3]\nI cannot accept the distinction drawn in the dissenting reasons in the Appellate Division between this case and Krook et al. v. Yewchuk et al. It is true that Krook et al. v, Yewchuk et al. was a vendor and purchaser situation. The vendor was selling a hotel property comprising land and chattels and he took back security on both, the chattel mortgage being expressed to be collateral to the land mortgage for the full amount. The present transaction is one between borrower and lender, mortgagor and mortgagee. The lender will not lend unless he gets certain security both on land and chattels. I can see no possible distinction between the vendor and purchaser and mortgagor and mortgagee relationships.\nIt is additional security that the lender wants. He would not lend without it. He is not interested in the personal covenant but in property. It is true that if the lender took security only on the land, he could not reach the chattel property by way of execution because he could not get a personal judgment. The lender is under no obligation to go into a transaction with these limitations and takes the security as part of the loan transaction. Under this legislation, he is and can only be interested in the taking of security. The taking of security on chattels does not offend in any way against the restriction in s. 34(17) of the right of the mortgagee to the land. He is seeking to enforce his security on chattels outside the terms of s. 34(17). He is enforcing his security on the land and he is enforcing his security on the chattels. In neither case is he attempting to get a personal judgment either directly or indirectly. The company's defence fails.\nAs to the guarantee, Superstein submitted that he was under no liability as guarantor since there was no debt owing by the principal debtor. He said that the effect of s, 34(17) (a) was to render it impossible that there should be any debt owing by the hotel company. The simple answer is that the hotel borrowed money from Credit Foncier on the security of land and chattels. This borrowing was neither illegal nor ultra vires and gave rise to a debt. Swan v, Bank of Scotland[4] does not apply. It was a case of illegality. But here, s. 34(17) is a procedural limitation. There was a borrowing and there was an unenforceable debt which will not disappear by the terms of s. 34(18) until a vesting order is made.\nThe second ground on which the guarantee is disputed is The Guarantees Acknowledgment Act. Section 4 provides:\n4 No guarantee executed after the first day of July, 1939, has any effect unless\n(a) the person entering into the obligation created thereby appears before a notary public and acknowledges his execution thereof, and\n(b) the notary public, being satisfied by examination of that person that the person is aware of the contents of the guarantee and understands it, issues a certificate under his hand and seal of office in the form set out in the Schedule.\nThere is no dispute over compliance with subs, (a). The dispute is over subs. (b). The certificate reads in full as follows:\nCANADA\nPROVINCE OF ALBERTA\nTHIS IS TO CERTIFY THAT JAKE SUPERSTEN of the City of Edmonton in the Province of Alberta, WHO IS KNOWN TO ME and is named as a party in a certain instrument in writing dated the 8th day of February, A.D. 1961, made between EDMONTON AIRPORT HOTEL CO. LTD. and CREDIT FONCIER FRANCO-CANADIEN this day appeared in person before me and acknowledged that he had executed the same and that I satisfied myself by examination that he was aware of and understood the contents of the said instrument.\nGIVEN at the City of Edmonton, in the Province of Alberta, this 8th day of February, A.D. 1961.\n(sgd) E. A. D. McCuaig\nA Notary Public in and for the Province of Alberta.\nThe certificate should have read that the instrument was made between Jake Superstein and Credit Foncier, and not between Edmonton Airport Hotel Co. Ltd. and Credit Foncier. The trial judge and the majority in the Appellate Division have held that as it stands, the certificate, in the circumstances of the case, is in compliance with the Act. As to Superstein's perfect understanding of the transaction there can be no doubt. Oral evidence of the Notary Public was admissible and relevant. If the certificate is questioned, that official is entitled to testify why he certified that he had satisfied himself by examination that he (Superstein) was aware of and understood the contents of the \"said instrument\". The \"said instrument\" was, of course, the mortgage. But the guarantee was attached to the mortgage and incorporated it by reference. It recites that in consideration of the advance of $300,000 made by the within named mortgagee (Credit Foncier) to the mortgagor (Edmonton Hotel) he, Superstein, guarantees payment of any money \"that shall be payable under the terms of the within mortgage\". I think that the plain and unmistakable meaning of the certificate is that Superstein knew and understood what obligations he was incurring in executing the guarantee of the recited mortgage and that this is compliance with the Act.\nSuperstein's third defence is that any guarantee of any mortgage indebtedness is void under the terms of s. 34(17) as an indirect method of attempting to impose personal liability under the mortgage. To me this defence cannot be distinguished from that put forward against the chattel mortgage. The guarantor is not and cannot be the mortgagor. Action is taken by the mortgagee to enforce the security. The enforcement of rights against a guarantor is another matter entirely. It is true, however, that before the decision of this Court in Krook et al. v. Yewchuk et al., there were Alberta decisions, which were reviewed in the reasons of Martland J. in Krook et al. v. Yewchuk et al. indicating that to enforce a guarantee of mortgage indebtedness was the same thing as enforcing a personal covenant. The origin of this theory seems to be in the judgment in Macdonald v. Clarkson et al.[5] The legislation, as it then stood, permitted a personal judgment against a mortgagor to the extent of a deficiency after realization of the security. The actual decision was that a covenant by a mortgagee, contained in an assignment of a mortgage, to indemnify an assignee in the event of failure by the mortgagor to pay the debt, involved an infraction of the predecessor of s. 34(17). With that I do not agree. Here was a mortgagee who wanted to realize on his security. To dispose of it to advantage he had to agree with an assignee of the mortgage that he would pay the mortgage debt. How could this affect a mortgagor who, under the legislation, was not so liable but only to the extent of the deficiency after realization of the security. The assumption of the mortgage indebtedness or covenant to pay if the mortgagor did not pay was a matter entirely between the mortgagee and the proposed assignee. If the mortgagor did not pay, the mortgagee could be compelled to take his mortgage back. His rights and those of the assignee of the mortgage against the mortgagor are throughout governed by the terms of the legislation and there could be no enlargement of these rights by the giving of this covenant between the mortgagee and assignee.\nThe case was a very insecure foundation for what was subsequently built upon it. It emphasizes the need for an examination of the particular facts in each case, but if the subsequent cases do say that s. 34(17) prevents a guarantee of a mortgage indebtedness, then they must be related, in turn, to Krook et al. v. Yewchuk et al., the reasoning of which, in my opinion, is directly contrary to any such proposition.\nI therefore think that the guarantor is liable on his guarantee and that his liability in no way depends upon the fact that his guarantee contains a waiver of the provisions of s. 34(17). I express no opinion on the question whether a person entitled to the benefit of the Act can waive its provisions. A guarantor is not so entitled.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendants, appellants: McLaws, Mc-Laws, Deyell, Dinkel, Floyd and Moore, Calgary.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: McCuaig, McCuaig, Desrochers, Beckingham and McDonald, Edmonton.\n[1] (1964), 48 W.W.R. 641. 47 D.L.R.

The trial judge had found the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. and its employees R and K to be solely responsible for the death of one G and the injuries sustained by his wife and daughter as the result of an accident in which the company's train, with the defendant R as its engineer and the defendant K as its conductor, struck a motor vehicle owned and operated by G while it was stationary with its front wheels on the company's railway line at a level crossing in the City of Calgary.\nIn July 1961 the City of Calgary applied for and obtained an order of the Board of Transport Commissioners authorizing the widening and paving of the street at the aforesaid crossing. It was provided in the order that: \"Within sixty days after completion of the said work the Canadian Pacific Railway Company shall install, and shall thereafter maintain, two flashing light signals and one bell on each dual lane at the said crossing.\" At the time of the accident the 60 days had not elapsed and the signals had not been installed.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed with variations from the trial judgment as against the defendant company and the defendant R; the appeal should be dismissed as against the defendant K and the defendant city.\nIt was provided by s. 312(1) (c) of the Railway Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 234, that: \"No train shall pass at a speed greater than ten miles an hour \u2026 over any highway crossing at rail level in respect of which crossing an order of the Board has been made to provide protection for the safety and convenience of the public and which order has not been complied with.\" The company's contention that these provisions should be interpreted as meaning that the company was not obliged to provide the public with the required protection against trains travelling in excess of 10 miles per hour until 60 days had elapsed after the city's work had been completed was not accepted. The combined purpose of the order of the Board and s. 312(1)(c) of the Railway Act was the protection of the safety and convenience of the users of the highway against the use of this crossing by trains travelling in excess of 10 miles per hour without the requisite lights and bells having been installed. This being the purpose of the legislation and the order, it followed that the language employed should, if possible, be interpreted so as to give effect to it. The language used was consistent with this interpretation.\nThe speed of the train in the present case was in excess of 30 miles an hour. Applying the standards expressed in the authorities, it could not be said that the trial judge was clearly wrong in concluding that under the circumstances the railway company was guilty of negligence which was causative of the collision in failing to comply with the provisions of s. 312(1) (c) of the Railway Act. Accordingly, this Court deferred to the trial judgment in that regard. Prudential Trust Co. Ltd. v. Forseth, [1960] S.C.R. 210, referred to.\nHowever, there was no evidence to justify a finding of negligence on the part of the conductor K. As to the engineer R, although the decision as to speed was not his, he did operate the train at a speed which constituted a breach of the provision of the Railway Act, and therefore, in the light of s. 392 of that Act, he, as well as the company, was technically liable for the damages which resulted.\nThe deceased was found negligent in that he failed to appreciate the existence of the railway crossing until his front wheels were on the track. Accordingly, it was held that the collision was caused by the combined fault of G on the one hand and the railway company and its employee on the other. In accordance with the provisions of s. 2 of The Contributory Negligence Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 56, the fault was apportioned equally.\nFor the reasons given in the Courts below, the appeal against the judgment in favour of the City of Calgary was dismissed.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], reversing a judgment of Manning J. Appeal allowed in part.\nW. J. Major, for the plaintiffs, appellants.\nH. M. Pickard, for the defendants, respondents, Canadian Pacific Railway Company, Russell and Kehough.\nW. R. Brennan, for the defendant, respondent, City of Calgary.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[2] dismissing the action of the present appellants and thereby reversing the judgment rendered by Manning J. at the trial of the action whereby he had found the Canadian Pacific Railway and its employees Russell and Kehough to be solely responsible for the death of George Olaf Gunderson and the injuries sustained by his wife and daughter as the result of an accident in which the railway company's train, with the respondent Russell as its engineer and the respondent Kehough as its conductor, struck a motor vehicle owned and operated by Gunderson while it was stationary with its front wheels on the company's railway line at a point where that line crosses 66th Avenue in the City of Calgary.\nThe accident happened on the afternoon of Sunday, October 1, 1961, when Gunderson, accompanied by his wife and family, was driving in an easterly direction on 66th Avenue and having stopped at a stop sign situate 24 feet 7 inches west of a railway crossing, he proceeded forward until his front wheels were on the western rail of the track and then saw a train approaching from the north at a speed in excess of 30 miles per hour and only about 50 feet away from him. Gunderson at once tried to reverse gears so as to get out of the way but was struck by the train before completing this operation. As has been indicated, Gunderson was killed and his wife and daughter, Gloria Ann, were injured as a result of the collision.\nUntil a few months before the accident, 66th Avenue W. in the vicinity of the railway crossing was a gravelled road and at the crossing itself the space between the rails was occupied by planks, but in July, 1961, the City of Calgary applied for and obtained an order of the Board of Transport Commissioners authorizing the widening and paving of the street at this crossing and by September 8, the work had been completed and the old gravel road had become a paved four-lane highway with the space between the rails no longer occupied by planks but covered with the same paved surface as the rest of the highway.\nIn the course of her evidence, Mrs. Gunderson described the appearance of the crossing when she and her husband had last been there and at the time of the accident in the following terms:\nQ. Mrs. Gunderson, it wasn't too clear to me whether you knew whether your husband had been over this crossing or not?\nA. Well, we\u2014both he and I were over the crossing, it must have been at least a year before that and it was all, you know, rough and weedy and everything. Q. It was a different type of crossing, was it?\nA. Yes.\nQ. It was paved at the time of the\u2014\nA. At the accident it was paved, but before it wasn't paved.\nQ. But it was along 66th Avenue, though?\nA. Well, yes, I remember but a long time back. I guess he expected it\nwould be still the same thing, you know, along there.\nQ. What was the condition of the crossing, do you know that, Mrs.\nGunderson?\nA. At the time of the accident?\nQ. Yes.\nA. Well, it was good, only there seemed to be kind of a little height on the road and then it went down, the tracks seemed to be hidden down there because they just sprung out all of a sudden like they came out of the ground.\nThe italics are my own.\nBefore the widening and paving of the crossing, the rough planks and grass would give motorists some indication that they were approaching a railway line and, under those conditions, the only additional visual warning consisted of a white post with cross arms, bearing the words \"Railway Crossing\", and a stop sign, erected by the City of Calgary. directly to the westward and about 11 feet distant from the cross. That this was not considered to be adequate protection for the public under the new conditions is evidenced by that part of the order of the Board of Transport Commissioners which authorized the widening and \"the installation of automatic protection at the said crossing\", and which provided that:\nWithin sixty days after completion of the said work the Canadian Pacific Railway Company shall install, and shall thereafter maintain, two flashing light signals and one bell on each dual lane at the said crossing.\nAt the time when this accident occurred the 60 days had not elapsed and the new signals had not been installed, so that the users of the highway were left with less than the maximum protection which the Board deemed necessary under the new conditions. Such a situation as this appears to me to have been contemplated by Parliament in passing s. 312(1) (c) of the Railway Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 234, which provides that:\n312. (1) No train shall pass at a speed greater than ten miles an hour\n***\n(c) over any highway crossing at rail level in respect of which crossing an order of the Board has been made to provide protection for the safety and convenience of the public and which order has not been complied with. The Appellate Division agreed with the submission made on behalf of the railway company that these provisions should be interpreted as meaning that the company was not obliged to provide the public with the required protection against trains travelling in excess of 10 miles per hour until 60 days had elapsed after the city's work had been completed. With the greatest respect for the reasoning of Macdonald J.A., expressed in the decision which he rendered on behalf of the Appellate Division, it appears to me that the combined purpose of the order of the Board and s. 312(1) (c) of the Railway Act is the protection of the safety and convenience of the users of the highway against the use of this crossing by trains travelling in excess of 10 miles per hour without the requisite lights and bells having been installed. This being the purpose of the legislation and the order, it follows that the language employed should, if possible, be interpreted so as to give effect to it. In my view the language used is consistent with this interpretation and I accordingly agree with the views expressed by the learned trial judge in the following paragraphs of his judgment:\nI am unable to accept this argument of the railway company. It would mean that for a period of sixty days after work was complete at this railway crossing the public were not entitled to be safe when crossing the railroad; that the public became entitled to safety only on the sixty-first day after the work was complete.\nIt appears to me that s. 312 was passed for the protection of people crossing railways and means that if the Board of Transport Commissioners makes an order, as it did in this case, that provides for warning signs on a railway crossing, the order is not complied with until the signs are installed. The fact that the railway company is allowed sixty days in which to comply with the order does not alter the fact that compliance had not yet taken place. I think that subs. (c) of s. 312 of the Railway Act as applied to this case means that during this sixty day period of \"grace\" when the railway company may continue to operate its trains without warning signs, it is required to operate them at the reduced speed of ten miles per hour.\nManning J. then proceeded to make the following finding of fact:\nThe speed of the train was over 30 miles an hour or more than three times as great as the ten miles per hour provided for by the Railway Act. I consider that there was negligence on the part of the railway company, the engineer who drove the train at this unlawful speed and the conductor who was in charge of the train and who could have had this speed reduced.\nApplying the standards expressed in the authorities which were reviewed and adopted in this Court in Prudential Trust Co. Ltd. v. Forseth[3], at p. 217, I am unable to say that the learned trial judge was clearly wrong in concluding that under the circumstances the railway company was guilty of negligence which was causative of the collision in failing to comply with the provisions of s. 312(1) (c) of the Railway Act and I accordingly defer to his judgment in that regard.\nI am, however, unable to find any evidence in the record to justify a finding of negligence on the part of the conductor Kehough. It is said that he was \"the conductor who was in charge of the train and who could have had this speed reduced\" but the only evidence in this regard is to be found in his own examination for discovery which he reaffirmed at the trial. That evidence was as follows:\nQ. How fast was the train going at this time?\nA. Well, up to there and about that time I would estimate the speed to be around 30 to 35 miles an hour.\nQ. Have you any control over the speed of the train?\nA. In what way, sir?\nQ. In any way?\nA. Well, we have what we call on the railroad a speed limit of 35 miles an hour on main tracks.\nQ. Is the conductor in charge of the train?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Can the conductor advise the engineer to slow down?\nA. Yes.\nQ. How would you advise the engineer to slow down if you thought it necessary when the train is going?\nA. Well, out of here the only way you can do that is if you were leaving Alyth, you would tell him there is a slow order here, or speed limit over so-and-so of so many miles an hour, but when the train is running the only way you are going to slow it down is to put the train into emergency, you come to a stop.\nQ. You have no communication with the engineer?\nA. No communication.\nQ. There is no way you can signal him?\nA. No.\nQ. And track speed on this day in this area was 35 miles an hour?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Even though it was within the City of Calgary?\nA. Yes.\nKehough was never asked whether or not he had told the engineer to slow down after leaving Alyth and the record is lacking in any affirmative evidence to prove that he was guilty of a breach of duty which caused or contributed to the accident. I would accordingly dismiss this appeal in so far as Kehough is concerned but without costs. The position of the respondent, Russell, is different. The only fault that can be attributed to him is that he was operating the train which, as we have now held, was travelling at a speed in excess of the permitted rate under s. 312(1) (c) of the Railway Act, and the decision to travel at that speed was not his. He was operating in accordance with his instructions. There is no evidence to show that he knew of the existence of the order of the Board of Transport Commissioners respecting the crossing in question. This is not a case in which the railway company employer is being made liable in respect of the negligent conduct of its employee. In this case the decision as to speed was that of the employer.\nHowever, notwithstanding this, Russell did operate the train at a speed which constituted a breach of the provision of the Railway Act, and therefore, in the light of s. 392 of that Act, he, as well as the company, is technically liable for the damages which resulted.\nIn reaching the conclusion that there was no contributory negligence on the part of Mr. Gunderson, Manning J. made certain assumptions based in large measure upon inferences which he drew from photographic exhibits which were before this Court as they were before him. I am unable to agree with this finding as I have formed the opinion that Mr. Gunderson was negligent in that he failed to appreciate the existence of the railway crossing until his front wheels were on the western rail. In this regard I accept the evidence of Mrs. Gunderson where she said in cross-examination:\nQ. Now, how long was the car, the automobile stopped at the stop sign?\nA. Oh, it just stopped and went, you know. Just enough to change it into the gears he had to change it into. You usually come to a stop, change gears and start it up.\nQ. And what happened after that, Mrs. Gunderson?\nA. Oh, all of a sudden the tracks just sprung up in front of me just like it came out from the ground in front of me and I said to my husband, \"Isn't that a dangerous crossing, dangerous tracks?\" probably I said, and he looked like that (indicating) and said, \"A train\".\nQ. And where was the car when he looked and he said, \"There is a train\"?\nA. I think almost on the track. By the time he got his mind set one way or the other it was on the tracks by that time. It takes a little while, you know, to get your mind working, I guess.\nQ. Yes, of course. How far would the train be when you first saw it?\nA. About fifty feet from me, I would say. Q. Did you look when your husband said, \"A train\", did you look?\nA. Yes, I looked when he said, \"A train\", I looked. I could see it.\nThis indicates to me that Mr. Gunderson having stopped at the stop sign and failed to see the railway crossing sign which was directly in front of it, moved forward into the path of the oncoming train. The learned trial judge, basing his conclusion in this regard on one photographic exhibit (ex. 14) thought that it could be assumed that while at the stop sign Gunderson's view of the train approaching from the north was blocked by a line of telegraph poles, but if this line of poles obscured the view of the tracks it was only at the one angle from which the photograph exhibited on behalf of the appellant (ex. 14) was later taken. It appears to me that even a slight movement of the driver's head would have brought his vision out of line with these poles and given him a clear view of the tracks, and in any event, the assumption that Gunderson looked at the tracks from this one position and that it was for this reason that he did not see the train, assumes also that he never looked again which he should, and no doubt would, have done if he had seen the railway crossing sign.\nI am accordingly of opinion that the collision was caused by the combined fault of Mr. Gunderson on the one hand and the railway company and its employee on the other.\nFrom the time that the front wheels of the Gunderson car touched the railway track the accident could not in my opinion have been avoided and in seeking to apportion degrees of fault, nothing is to be gained by attempting to reconstruct the actions of the people concerned during the last seconds before the impact, nor do I find it possible to establish with any reasonable degree of certainty whether one party was more to blame than the other in creating the position of danger which made the collision inevitable. In accordance with the provisions of s. 2 of The Contributory Negligence Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 56, I therefore find that the fault should be apportioned equally.\nAs was indicated at the hearing of this appeal, the appeal against the judgment in favour of the City of Calgary should be dismissed with costs for the reasons stated by both the learned trial judge and the Appellate Division.\nI see no reason to disturb the assessment of damages as awarded by the learned trial judge. In the result, I would allow this appeal as against the Canadian Pacific Railway Company and Robert Williamson Russell with costs in this Court to be recovered from the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, and I direct that the order of Mr. Justice Manning be varied so as to provide that Mrs. Mary Evelyn Gunderson as executrix of the estate of George Olaf Gunderson do recover from the respondents, except the City of Calgary, the sum of $40,000 to be apportioned $2,500 to Linda Darlene Gunderson, $3,000 to Gloria Ann Gunderson, and $34,500 to Mary Evelyn Gunderson; and that it be further varied to provide that Mary Evelyn Gunderson in her personal capacity do recover the further sum of $672.50, and that Gloria Ann Gunderson do recover the sum of $200.\nI would not interfere with the disposition of the costs in the Courts below.\nAppeal against Canadian Pacific Railway Company and Robert Williamson Russell allowed with costs in this Court to be recovered from Canadian Pacific Railway Company, and judgment at trial varied. Appeal against John Kehough dismissed without costs. Appeal against City of Calgary dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the plaintiffs, appellants: W. J.

Gilbert, [1965] S.C.R. 457\nDate: 1965-04-09\nGeorge David Corrie and Mabel Lillian Corrie (Plaintiffs) Appellants;\nand\nVernon Letton Gilbert (Defendant) Respondent.\n1965: March 2, 3; 1965: April 9.\nPresent: Abbott, Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Hall JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nDamages\u2014Motor vehicle accident\u2014Injury giving rise to phlebitis\u2014Preexisting disability\u2014Both award of jury and that of Court of Appeal rejected by Supreme Court.\nAs a result of a motor vehicle accident the female plaintiff suffered bruises to her right hip and her left shoulder, muscle injury to her neck and an injury to her left leg from which phlebitis developed. Some years before the accident the plaintiff had suffered from phlebitis of the left foot but this condition had cleared up and although she suffered from a vascular condition in this leg through the years it had been arrested, following an operation, to a point where she was able to lead a reasonably active life without discomfort. Liability for the accident was admitted by the defendant and the parties agreed upon the amount of the special damages. The trial and appeal were exclusively concerned with the assessment of general damages. The jury's award having been reduced by the Court of Appeal, the plaintiffs appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Abbott and Judson JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the Court of Appeal varied.\nPer Martland, Ritchie and Hall JJ.: The damages were to be assessed upon the basis of the injury suffered by the plaintiff as it manifested itself at the date of the trial, making due allowance for the probable future developments but excluding such matters as remained in the sphere of possibility. Upon that basis the verdict of the jury was inordinately high.\nIn treating the prospects of an increase in the plaintiff's pre-existing disability and the probability of her receiving such an injury as she did in any event, as matters to be considered in reduction of the damages to which she was entitled, the Court of Appeal was giving weight to factors which should have been left out of account and an award based on such considerations should not stand. Further, the Court of Appeal had fallen into the error of substituting its opinion as to the weight to be given to the evidence respecting the plaintiff's present disability for that of the jury.\nIt was unusual in this Court on an appeal such as this to reject both the award of the jury and that of the Court of Appeal, but there was no doubt that under s. 46 of the Supreme Court Act it was empowered to give the judgment that the Court whose decision was appealed against should have given. Reviewing the evidence as a whole, and having regard to the fact that the mild permanent disability from which the plaintiff suffered before the accident had, owing to the blow which she received through the fault of the defendant, become a serious permanent disability due to phlebitis, the opinion was reached that an award of $8,000 would afford a more realistic compensation than either the $20,000 awarded by the jury or the $3,000 to which the Court of Appeal reduced it.\nMarcroft v. Scruttons, Ltd., [1954] 1 Lloyd's Rep. 395, referred to.\nPer Abbott and Judson JJ., dissenting: The task of this Court was not to retry the issues but to determine whether there was any reversible error in the judgment of the Court of Appeal. No such error was found.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia allowing an appeal from a judgment rendered by Ruttan J. sitting with a jury and thereby reducing the general damages awarded by the jury in respect of injuries sustained by the appellant as a result of a motor vehicle accident. Appeal allowed and judgment of the Court of Appeal varied, Abbott and Judson JJ. dissenting.\nT. O. Griffiths, for the plaintiffs, appellants.\nF. U. Collier and J.M. Miller, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of Abbott and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nJUDSON J. (dissenting):\u2014The Court of Appeal has thought this an appropriate case for the review of a jury's award of $20,000 for damages for personal injuries. A unanimous judgment has reduced these damages to $3,000. I agree with the reasons of Sheppard J.A. in their entirety.\nI wish to repeat what I said in my dissenting reasons in Roumieu v. Osborne[1], that our task is not to retry the issues but to determine whether there is reversible error in the judgment of the Court of Appeal. I can find none.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nThe judgment of Martland, Ritchie and Hall JJ. was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia allowing an appeal from a judgment rendered by Ruttan J. sitting with a jury and thereby reducing from $20,000 to $3,000 the general damages which the jury had awarded in respect of injuries sustained by the appellant, Mabel Lillian Corrie, when the respondent backed his car into a stationary vehicle moving it backwards in such manner that its door struck Mrs. Corrie knocking her to the ground and causing bruises to her right hip and her left shoulder, muscle injury to her neck and an injury to her left leg from which phlebitis developed.\nThe defendant admitted liability for the accident and the parties agreed upon special damages at the sum of $543.17. The trial and appeal were exclusively concerned with the assessment of general damages.\nAlthough the injuries to Mrs. Corrie's hip, shoulder and neck caused her pain and discomfort for some time, the matter with which this appeal is chiefly concerned is the condition of her left leg.\nSome twenty years before the accident (i.e. in 1940) Mrs. Corrie had suffered from phlebitis of the left foot but this condition had cleared up and although she suffered from vascular disorders in this leg through the years they were confined to the superficial and communicating veins and an operation had been successfully performed in 1960 which, while not effecting a complete cure of this condition, had nevertheless arrested it to a point where Mrs. Corrie was able to lead a reasonably active life without discomfort.\nWithout reviewing the very lengthy medical evidence in detail, I adopt the following general description of the change in condition brought about by the accident which is contained in the reasons for judgment rendered on behalf of the Court of Appeal by Sheppard J.A. where he says:\nThe general medical evidence is that prior to the accident she had a mild permanent disability; following the accident she had a serious permanent disability due to phlebitis which had affected some of the valves and created some turgidity.\nFour doctors testified as to the condition of Mrs. Corrie's leg, only two of whom (Davis and Sutherland) had seen the leg before the accident, and although there is some difference between them as to the prognosis, they are all agreed that the phlebitis still present at the time of the trial was caused by the blow sustained in the accident.\nIn reducing the damage award, Mr. Justice Sheppard was clearly of the opinion that the jury had based its verdict in large measure upon the frightening \"possibilities\" attendant upon the post-traumatic phlebitis which Mrs. Corrie had developed as a result of the accident, and it was stressed on behalf of the respondent in this Court that in putting the case to the jury Mrs. Corrie's counsel had over-emphasized these \"possibilities\" and that the learned trial judge had failed to give sufficient direction as to the necessity of leaving them out of account in assessing the damages to be awarded.\nIn the course of his charge to the jury, Mr. Justice Ruttan, who presided at the trial, after having stated that the case was to be decided \"upon the balance of probabilities\" went on to say:\nFor example, in this case there has been a good deal of evidence given of the possibility of this poor lady's suffering loss of nutrition in her legs due to the disturbance of the flow of blood causing ulceration and eventually necessitating an amputation of the leg. I think I am fair in saying that both Dr. McConkey and Dr. Sutherland thought that such a development was only a possibility and a remote possibility at that. I think the evidence of both these doctors is that was not a probable development it has only a remote possibility. That is an illustration of possibility against probability. Furthermore there was another possibility that was suggested, of sudden death that might be occasioned this lady due to pulmonary embolism. I will not go through all the medical way in which pulmonary embolism develops and causes death; I think you are as well versed in that as I am now, but you will remember that was a possibility put forward and suggested by counsel, both to the doctors, and in argument to you of a possible future development of this case for this lady. Once again I think that both doctors agreed that the possibility of death from a pulmonary embolism is just that, \"a possibility\" and not a very reasonable possibility or a very obvious possibility at that. The probability is that the lady may continue to suffer from the embolism; indeed, the evidence is, and I think this is a probability to be drawn from the evidence, that she has suffered from embolisms this year in April and again in August, but that these were, I will not say \"minor embolisms\" because the doctors say no embolism is a minor difficulty, but they were not grave. They are serious, they are painful, but they are not grave.\nDealing with the possibility of embolism again a little later in the charge, the learned trial judge said:\nI just give that as another illustration of a possibility, but as I see it, not a probability in the opinion of the experts.\nIt is, however, noteworthy that the learned trial judge treated these \"possibilities\" as being a factor in increasing nervous tension and in this regard he suggested:\nMr. Griffiths did suggest to you, very properly, as he is entitled to, that even though these may be mere possibilities\u2014that is, the possibility of ulceration and amputation or death from a pulmonary embolism, and even though they may be remote, none the less he says they exist presently in the mind of Mrs. Corrie, with her day to day as possibilities which may happen, and to that extent, increase her present nervous tension. Well, as a factor in her continuing nervous tension, you may consider it. In my opinion the trial judge, having correctly instructed the jury that their verdict was to be based upon \"probability\", sufficiently illustrated the difference between \"probabilities\" and \"possibilities\" in relation to the present case and there was no misdirection in this regard. I do not, however, think that there was any evidence in the record to warrant the instruction to the jury that they might consider the serious \"possibilities\" as a factor contributing to the plaintiff's nervous tension. To so direct the jury was, in my view, having regard to the evidence, to invite speculation.\nIt is my opinion that the damages in the present case are to be assessed upon the basis of the injury suffered by Mrs. Corrie as it manifested itself at the date of the trial, making due allowance for the probable future developments but excluding such matters as remain in the sphere of possibility, and that upon this basis the verdict of the jury was inordinately high.\nIt is apparent, however, that the drastic reduction made by the Court of Appeal was also based upon other considerations because Mr. Justice Sheppard, having excluded from his reasoning all the more serious developments which might arise as a result of the phlebitis went on to say:\nFurther, her claim, for disability is reduced to the extent that her previous disability would have increased irrespective of the accident. The blow she suffered was not severe; the car in front had backed up only two or three feet and had had no great opportunity to accelerate. The plaintiff was not knocked flat on the sidewalk and her injuries did not at any time confine her to hospital or to bed. As the blow was so slight as not to confine her to hospital or to bed there must be estimated the probability of her receiving an equivalent injury in any event, had the accident not happened. Also, she had suffered from a varicose condition between 1942 and 1960 and this condition ordinarily requires a lifetime of treatment, that is, that it is liable to recur, according to Dr. Sutherland; and Dr. McConkey says that condition usually produces progressive trouble and some degeneration. Dr. Davis was unable to say whether her condition after the accident would have occurred in any event.\nUnder those circumstances the allowance of $20,000 as the difference between her disability before the accident and after is so inordinately high as to indicate an error within Nance v. B.C. Electric Railway Co. [1952] 1 W.W.R. 665.\nThe italics are my own.\nIt appears to me with all respect that Mr. Justice Sheppard's finding that the plaintiff's \"claim for disability is reduced to the extent that her previous disability would have increased irrespective of the accident\" is open to serious question. In the first place the \"previous disability\" while vascular in origin, was not at all the same thing as the disability which was caused by the accident, and in the second place, when the medical evidence is considered as a whole, the chance of her previous disability increasing is as much in the field of \"possibility\" as that of an embolism developing from phlebitis.\nFurthermore, it appears to me that in making allowance for the \"probability of her receiving an equivalent injury in any event, had the accident not happened\", Mr. Justice Sheppard was giving weight to a factor which should not have been taken into consideration.\nIn this regard I refer to the following sentence from Mayne & McGregor on Damages, para. 102, p. 94 where it is said:\nIt has never been seriously disputed that an admitted or established wrongdoer is liable for any increased injury to his victim by reason of an abnormal physical susceptibility.\nThe observations of Lord Justice Denning in Marcroft v. Scruttons, Ltd.[2], although obiter dicta in that case appear to me to be significant. He there said, at p. 401:\nThis man was injured in an accident which was not in itself very serious. He fell about 10 ft. while working on board ship. He did not break any bones, and was not even cut as far as we know, although he may have been bruised. But at the time he had, unbeknown to him, a constitutional weakness which made it very serious for him, because the accident operating on that weakness produced in him a very severe nervous shock, trembling from head to foot. He stammered, and was quite unable to do his work. His constitutional weakness was such that, apart from the accident, any other disturbing factor might have produced a similar result. Any illness or worry, or even loss of work, might do it. None the less, in assessing damages we must, I think, disregard this factor, because a wrongdoer must take his victim as he finds him, with all his weaknesses, whether it be a thin skull or any other constitutional weakness.\nIn treating the prospects of an increase in the plaintiff's pre-existing disability and the probability of her receiving such an injury as she did in any event, as matters to be considered in reduction of the damages to which she is entitled, the Court of Appeal was, in my respectful opinion, giving weight to factors which should have been left out of account and an award based on such considerations should not stand.\nIn the course of his evidence, upon which the jury were entitled to rely, Dr. Sutherland, having stated that varicose veins is a different condition from phlebitis, went on to describe the difference between the condition of the plaintiff's leg before and after the accident. As to her condition before the accident he said:\nMrs. Corrie had a mild permanent disability in her leg as a result of the condition that she had and the operation that was done. After all, we did interrupt some veins which may have been partly functioning, may not have been. So that she would have a small permanent disability which would reduce her effectiveness a very small amount over a normal person who had never had either the disease or the operation.\nAs to her condition after the accident he said:\nThe condition by the time of the second visit it was obvious that she had deep vein phlebitis \u2026And this has gone from acute phlebitis now to the chronic phlebitis, so that she has pain in her leg all the time, she has tenderness all over the veins, the deep veins in her leg, she has swelling of her ankle and foot chronic now.\nIn the course of his reasons for judgment, Mr. Justice Sheppard described the effect on the plaintiff of her present disability in the following terms:\nHer actual disability was a limitation in walking and in her housework to the extent that she would not cause her leg to be overtired.\nDr. Sutherland describes this condition as follows:\nYes. She has to pamper her left leg now. She can walk only so far and stand only so long until she has to get off her feet and get her foot up in the air \u2026 This is not what Mrs. Corrie told me. I am telling her this is what she must do. When she walks and gets pain in her leg and when she stands and gets pain in her leg she must get off it and get it elevated \u2026\nLater in his evidence Dr. Sutherland was asked:\nQ. \u2026Would you describe it in terms of a general description?\nA. I think she has a severe disability in her left leg, yes.\nQ. Can you give us any indication as to whether or not you consider\nit to be permanent?\nA. It is permanent, yes.\nQ. Can you give us any indication as to whether it will improve or\nworsen in the future?\nA. It will get gradually worse.\nRule 36 of the British Columbia Court of Appeal Rules provides that:\nWhere excessive damages have been awarded by a jury, if the Court is of the opinion that the verdict is not otherwise unreasonable, it may reduce the damages without the consent of either party instead of ordering a new trial.\nAnd it was pointed out to us by counsel for the respondent that R. 4(1) of The Court of Appeal Rules provides that:\nAll appeals to the Court shall be by way of rehearing . . .\nIn my opinion this does not mean that the Court of Appeal in reviewing an award of damages is at liberty to disregard evidence which the jury was entitled to take into account in reaching its award, and in my respectful opinion, Mr. Justice Sheppard has fallen into the error of substituting his opinion as to the weight to be given to the evidence for that of the jury.\nI am, however, as I have indicated, of opinion that no jury acting judicially, could have reached the verdict of $20,000 if they had confined themselves to the existing injury and its probable future development.\nIt is unusual in this Court on an appeal such as this to reject both the award of the jury and that of the Court of Appeal, but there is no doubt that under s. 46 of the Supreme Court Act it is empowered to give the judgment that the Court whose decision is appealed against should have given, and for the reasons which I have stated, I do not think the award made by either of the Courts below should be affirmed.\nAfter reviewing the evidence as a whole, and having regard to the fact that the mild permanent disability from which the plaintiff suffered before the accident has, owing to the blow which she received through the fault of the respondent, become a serious permanent disability due to phlebitis, I have reached the opinion that an award of $8,000 would afford a more realistic compensation than either the $20,000 awarded by the jury or the $3,000 to which the Court of Appeal reduced it.\nI observe that the formal judgments rendered at trial and in the Court of Appeal constitute an award of general damages to both of the appellants. As this award is made in respect of personal injuries sustained by the female appellant, I can see no ground upon which George David Corrie is entitled to share in it.\nI would allow this appeal with costs and direct that the judgment of the Court of Appeal be varied by increasing the damages awarded from $3,000 to $8,000 and awarding these damages to the female appellant, Mabel Lillian Corrie.\nAppeal allowed with costs, damages increased, ABBOTT and JUDSON JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, appellants: Griffiths, McLelland & Co., Vancouver.\nSolicitor for the defendant, respondent: G.

Act, 1867, ss. 91(27), 92(14).\nOn the same day that the coroner was holding an inquest into the death of one Thomas, the appellant and eight others were arrested and each of them was separately charged with the non-capital murder of Thomas. The coroner immediately closed the inquest. Subsequently, on the order of the Attorney-General, made pursuant to s. 8a of the Coroners Act, R.S.S. 1953, c. 106, as amended in 1960, the inquest was re-opened. On the fourth day of the inquest, counsel for the Crown stated his intention to call and examine as witnesses the appellant and the eight others who were present, they having been served with a subpoena. The coroner ruled that each of them was a compellable witness. The appellant applied for a writ of prohibition. The writ was refused by the trial judge, and his judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. The appellant was granted leave to appeal to this Court.\nHeld (Fauteux J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.\nPer Taschereau C.J. and Cartwright, Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Spence JJ.: The criminal law in force in Saskatchewan is that of England as it existed on July 15, 1870, except as altered, varied, modified or affected by the Criminal Code or any other Act of the Parliament of Canada. Under that law as it existed on that date, a person charged with murder and awaiting trial could not be compelled to testify at an inquest into the death of the deceased with whose murder he was charged. No alteration has been made in this state of the law by the combined effect of ss. 2, 4(1) and 5 of the Canada Evidence Act and ss. 448 and 488(3) of the Criminal Code. These sections of the Canada Evidence Act do not have the effect of rendering an accused a compellable witness at the coroner's inquest. It would require clear words to bring about so complete a change in the law as it existed in 1870. It would be a strange inconsistency if the law which carefully protects an accused from being compelled to make any statement at a preliminary inquiry should permit that inquiry to be adjourned in order that the prosecution be permitted to take the accused before a coroner and submit him against his will to examination and cross-examination as to his supposed guilt. In the absence of clear words in an Act of Parliament or other compelling authority, that is not the state of the law. The case of R. v. Barnes, 36 C.C.C. 40, not followed. By enacting s. 15 of the Coroners Act in its present form, the Legislature intended to change the law and to render a person charged with murder compellable to give evidence at the inquest on the body of his alleged victim. Such legislation trenches upon the rule expressed in the maxim nemo tenetur seipsum accusare. Any legislation purporting to make such a change in the law or to abrogate or alter the existing rules which protect a person charged with a crime from being compelled to testify against himself, is legislation in relation to the Criminal Law including the Procedure in Criminal Matters and therefore within the exclusive legislative authority of the Parliament under s. 91(27) of the B.N.A. Act.\nPer Fauteux J., dissenting. The proposition that the competency and compellability of a person to be called as a witness must be determined with reference solely to the particular proceeding in which it is proposed to call the person as a witness is a rule that receives an application even in criminal trials where several persons, though jointly indicted, are proceeded against separately. In such cases, it is the settled law that neither one is regarded as an accused person or a party in the trial against the others. Under our law, there is no party, no accused in a coroner's inquest and it is only at the conclusion of the inquest that may arise the possibility of a person being alleged to have committed murder and then compelled, by a coroner's warrant, to appear in the criminal Courts. The rule nemo tenetur seipsum accusare has, through the years, been modified or trenched upon by statute and the privileges to which it gave rise have, in certain cases, been conditioned or abrogated. The word \"charged\" in s. 4(1) of the Canada Evidence Act makes it clear that the privilege mentioned in that section is conferred to no other than a person charged with an offence, to whom it becomes available on no occasion and time other than when the prosecution against him for that offence is actually proceeded with in the criminal Courts. The provisions of s. 5(1) and (2) of the Canada Evidence Act are unqualified and of general application. Subject only to some exceptions which do not apply at a coroner's inquest, no one\u2014other than a person charged of an offence, on the occasion and at the time at which he is actually proceeded against for that offence\u2014is excused on the ground that the answers he might give may tend to incriminate him. If a co-accused, of which the prosecution is not actually proceeded with in the criminal Courts, is a compellable and competent witness when called to testify in the prosecution of another co-accused, a fortiori a person, whether charged or not with an offence is a compellable and competent witness at a coroner's inquest where no one is regarded by law as an accused.\nThe appellant could not be excused and was bound by s. 5(1) of the Canada Evidence Act, but was entitled to the protection of subs. 2.

Le coroner jugea que chacun d'eux \u00e9tait un t\u00e9moin contraignable. L'appelant fit une requ\u00eate pour l'obtention d'un bref de prohibition.

Ces articles de la Loi sur la preuve au Canada n'ont pas l'effet de rendre un accus\u00e9 un t\u00e9moin contraignable \u00e0 l'enqu\u00eate du coroner. Il faudrait des mots pr\u00e9cis pour apporter un changement aussi complet au droit tel qu'il existait en 1870. Ce serait une \u00e9trange inconsistance si la loi qui prot\u00e8ge soigneusement un accus\u00e9 contre la contrainte de faire une d\u00e9claration \u00e0 l'enqu\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire, permettait que cette enqu\u00eate soit ajourn\u00e9e pour que la poursuite ait l'opportunit\u00e9 d'amener l'accus\u00e9 devant un coroner et de la soumettre contre sa volont\u00e9 \u00e0 un interrogatoire et contre-interrogatoire sur sa pr\u00e9tendue culpabilit\u00e9. En l'absence de mots pr\u00e9cis dans une loi du parlement ou autre autorit\u00e9 irr\u00e9sistible, ceci n'est pas la loi. La cause de R. v.

Dans de tels cas, il est de r\u00e8gle bien arr\u00eat\u00e9e qu'aucune de ces personnes n'est consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une personne accus\u00e9e ou une partie au proc\u00e8s des autres. Sous le r\u00e9gime de notre droit, il n'y a aucune partie, aucun accus\u00e9 \u00e0 l'enqu\u00eate du coroner, et c'est seulement \u00e0 la conclusion de l'enqu\u00eate que peut survenir la possibilit\u00e9 qu'une personne soit accus\u00e9e d'avoir commis un meurtre et alors contrainte, par mandat du coroner, de se pr\u00e9senter devant les Cours criminelles.

Les dispositions de l'art. 5(1) et (2) de la Loi sur la preuve au Canada sont absolues et d'application g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.

On the same day the Coroner, J. E. Nunn, commenced the holding of an inquest into the death. Later on the same day the appellant and eight other men were arrested and each of them was separately charged with the non-capital murder of Thomas. The Coroner then discharged the jury and closed the inquest as he was required to do by the terms of s.8(a) (2) of The Coroners Act, R.S.S. 1953, c. 106, as amended by Statutes of Saskatchewan, 1960, c. 14. Subsequently, on a date not given in the record, the Attorney General for Saskatchewan directed, pursuant to the last mentioned sub-section, that the inquest be reopened. On May 18, 1963, the appellant and the eight others charged were granted bail. June 12, 1963, was set for the preliminary hearing of the charges against the appellant and the other eight persons also charged. The Coroner fixed the same date for the commencement of the reopened inquest. On June 12, 1963, at the request of the Attorney General, the preliminary hearings were adjourned until after the conclusion of the inquest.\nThe inquest opened on June 12, 1963, and continued on June 13 and June 14. During this time twenty-two witnesses were called and examined. The appellant and each of the other persons charged with the murder of Thomas had been served with a Coroner's subpoena requiring attendance at the inquest and all were present. On June 14, counsel appointed by the Attorney General to act for the Crown at the inquest stated that he intended to call the appellant and each of the other accused persons as witnesses at the inquest. Counsel for all of the accused objected that neither the Coroner nor the Crown could compel a person already charged with the murder of Thomas, whose death was being investigated, to be sworn as a witness at the inquest. After hearing argument the Coroner ruled that each of the accused was a compellable witness at the inquest and must give evidence. In his brief reasons the Coroner stated that he was bound to rule as he did by the Saskatchewan legislation. His reasons do not indicate whether the constitutional validity of that legislation had been questioned in argument before him.\nFollowing this ruling, at the request of counsel for the appellant, the Coroner adjourned the inquest sine die to permit the bringing of an application for prohibition. While this application was pending Mr. Nunn, the Coroner, died and the proceedings have been continued with the Attorney General for Saskatchewan substituted as respondent.\nThe application for prohibition came in due couse before Bence C.J.Q.B. and was dismissed. There is nothing in the material filed in support of the application or in the reasons of the learned Chief Justice to indicate that the validity of any provision of The Coroners Act was questioned.\nThe learned Chief Justice followed the decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in Rex v. Barnes[4] in which it was held, affirming the decision of Orde J., that Barnes who was charged with manslaughter in the death of one Rossiter was a compellable witness at an inquest being held to inquire into Rossiter's death. In the Court of Appeal Meredith C.J.C.P. expressed the opinion that while Barnes was compellable to be sworn as a witness at the inquest it would not be lawful to examine him in any way regarding the charge pending against him; this view was not shared by any other member of the Court of Appeal or by Orde J.\nHaving quoted ss. 8(a) and 15 of The Coroners Act and s. 5 of The Canada Evidence Act, Bence, C.J. Q.B. said in part:\nThe provisions of The Coroners Act, which I have quoted, and Section 5 of the Canada Evidence Act seem to me to be quite clear. The applicant herein is called as a witness to give evidence as to his knowledge of what took place. Authority to call him is contained in The Coroners Act and the Canada Evidence Act stipulates that he shall not be excused.\nIn my view there should be no such limitations on the questions put to him as were suggested by Meredith, C.J., in the Barnes case, which I have quoted.\nThe appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal; paragraph 2 of the notice of appeal reads as follows:\nThe Coroner's Court is a Criminal Court of Record and Sections 8a and 15 of The Coroners Act, R.S.S. 1953, as amended by chapter 14 of the Statutes of Saskatchewan, 1960, on which the said judgment is wholly, or partly, based, were and are ultra vires of the Province, being enactments dealing with Criminal Law and Procedure.\nThe unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal[5] was delivered by Culliton C. J. S. holding (i) that the impugned sections of The Coroners Act are intra vires of the legislature as being in relation to the administration of justice in the province rather than in relation to the criminal law or the procedure in criminal matters, (ii) that, even if the impugned sections were held to be invalid, the combined effect of ss. 2 and 5(1) of the Canada Evidence Act would render the appellant a compellable witness at the inquest; and (iii) that the provisions of the Canadian Bill of Rights were not contravened, because the appellant, although compelled to testify at the inquest, would be entitled to the protection afforded by s. 5(2) of the Canada Evidence Act. In the result the appeal was dismissed.\nIt will be convenient to consider first what the position of the appellant, when called upon to take the witness stand at the inquest in Saskatchewan, would be under the existing law apart from the provisions of the impugned sections of The Coroners Act.\nBy the combined effect of s. 7, of the Criminal Code, 1954, 2-3- Eliz. II, c. 51, s. 16 of the Saskatchewan Act, Statutes of Canada, 1905, 4-5- Ed. VII, c. 42 and s. 11 of the Northwest Territories Act, R.S.C. 1886, c. 50, the criminal law in force in Saskatchewan is that of England as it existed on July 15, 1870, except as altered, varied, modified or affected by the Criminal Code or any other act of the Parliament of Canada.\nIn 1870 a person accused of crime and the spouse of such person were incompetent to testify at trial either for or against the accused. This incompetency was done away with as to some offences by s. 216 of The Criminal Procedure Act, R.S.C. 1886, c. 174, but as to most offences, including that of murder, it was preserved by s. 217 of that Act and continued until the coming into force of The Canada Evidence Act, 1893, 56 Vict., c. 31. That Act came into force on July 1, 1893, and on the same day The Criminal Procedure Act was repealed.\nSection 4 of The Canada Evidence Act as originally enacted read as follows:\n4. Every person charged with an offence, and the wife or husband, as the case may be, of the person so charged, shall be a competent witness, whether the person so charged is charged solely or jointly with any other person. Provided, however, that no husband shall be competent to disclose any communication made to him by his wife during their marriage, and no wife shall be competent to disclose any communication made to her by her husband during their marriage.\n2. The failure of the person charged, or of the wife or husband of such person, to testify, shall not be made the subject of comment by the judge or by counsel for the prosecution in addressing the jury.\nIn Gosselin v. The King[6] , the majority of the Court expressed the opinion that the effect of this section, read with s. 5, was to render an accused and his spouse not merely competent but compellable. We need not pause to inquire whether this opinion was well-founded as the Act was amended by 1906, 6 Ed. VII, c. 10, s. 1, by the insertion of the words \"for the defence\" after the word \"witness\".\nThe present form of s. 4(1) is as follows:\n4 (1) Every person charged with an offence, and, except as in this section otherwise provided, the wife or husband, as the case may be, of the person so charged, is a competent witness for the defence, whether the person so charged is charged solely or jointly with any other person.\nSection 5 is as follows:\n5. (1) No witness shall be excused from answering any question upon the ground that the answer to such question may tend to criminate him, or may tend to establish his liability to a civil proceeding at the instance of the Crown or of any person.\n(2) Where with respect to any question a witness objects to answer upon the ground that his answer may tend to criminate him, or may tend to establish his liability to a civil proceeding at the instance of the Crown or of any person, and if but for this Act, or the Act of any provincial legislature, the witness would therefore have been excused from answering such question, then although the witness is by reason of this Act, or by reason of such provincial Act, compelled to answer, the answer so given shall not be used or receivable in evidence against him in any criminal trial, or other criminal proceeding against him thereafter taking place, other than a prosecution for perjury in the giving of such evidence. It is now clear that a person who is being tried on a criminal charge is a competent witness if he decides to testify but that he cannot be compelled by the prosecution to enter the witness box. If he decides to testify he is subject to cross-examination and compellable to answer any relevant questions put to him on cross-examination although his answers may tend to establish his guilt of the charge on which he is being tried.\nIt seems equally clear that where two or more persons are. either jointly or separately, indicted for one offence and are tried separately one of those indicted who is not on trial is a compellable witness, for either the prosecution or the defence, at the trial of any of his co-accused. On this point it is sufficient to refer to the case of Re Regan[7] where the history and reasons of the rule are fully covered in the arguments of counsel and in the judgments.\nIn the case at bar, it is clear that had the preliminary hearing of the charge against the appellant proceeded he could not have been compelled to testify, and that it would have been the duty of the presiding justice to warn him, in the terms prescribed by s. 454(1) of the Criminal Code, that he was not bound to say anything.\nWe have not been referred to any case in England in which an accused awaiting trial on a charge of the murder of the person whose death was under investigation was compelled to give evidence at the inquest. It is unlikely that such a case would arise after the passing of s. 20 of the Coroners (Amendment) Act 1926, 16 and 17 Geo. V, c. 59; but if the power to compel such an accused person to testify existed previously it would seem strange that it was never exercised. In Ex parte Cook[8] , an application was made to the Court of Queen's Bench at the instance of the Coroner who was conducting an inquest on the body of one Hannah Moore for a writ to bring before the Coroner and jury one Cook who was in custody in Newgate awaiting trial on a charge of having wilfully murdered her. His presence was stated to be required for two purposes, (i) to give evidence as to the deceased's state of mind, it being alleged that Cook and the deceased had entered into a suicide pact and that Cook was the only person who knew her and (ii) so that the witnesses called at the inquest could identify Cook. The writ was refused. In commenting on this case it is suggested in Jervis on Coroners, 4th ed., (1880), at page 214 that an order of the nature sought \"will generally be made if the prisoner is not the party under accusation; or, if he is accused or suspected, then when he is desirous of making a statement, and perhaps also when his presence is requisite for the purpose of identification\".\nIn the course of the argument Patteson J, at page 658, asked counsel the question:\u2014\"Have you an instance where a writ has been granted to bring up a prisoner before a Coroner?\" and the answer was \"None has been found\".\nEarlier in the argument, Coleridge J. had said at page 657:\nI think it is usual, on a motion of this nature, to state the readiness of the party to come: at all events when he is to come as a witness.\nWilliams J. said at page 660:\nNo case of inconvenience has existed in the Coroner's: Court for centuries, by reason of no such writ having been granted.\nIn each of the cases of The King v. Scorey[9] and Wakley v. Cooke[10] , referred to by counsel for the respondent, the Coroner was criticized for having refused to hear evidence tendered on behalf of a person suspected of being criminally responsible for the death of the person which was under investigation. In the latter case at page 518, Alderson B. said:\nThen comes the question whether the other part of the direction was correct. The direction had reference to the practice which prevailed in the examination of persons before inquests held in Middlesex, in refusing to examine parties whose conduct might afterwards become the subject of a criminal inquiry. I quite agree with what my Brother Parke has said upon the matter. I hope that the practice will be discontinued, for it is highly improper, and that persons will be permitted to make any statements they may wish, when they have any material information to communicate. The refusal to accept a person's testimony casts a gross imputation upon him. A person who comes before a coroner cannot be considered as being a party accused, and he is not so until after a verdict has been found. Such a practice is monstrous and most harassing, and I hope it will be discontinued for the future, and that people will be allowed to make statements. They are not bound to criminate themselves, and ought to be told so at the time.\nThere is nothing in the judgments in either of these cases to suggest that a person charged with the murder of a person into whose death an inquest was being held could be compelled to testify at such inquest. In Stephen's History of the Criminal Law of England, (1883), vol. 1, at pp. 440 and 441, the learned author after pointing out that soon after the revolution of 1688 the practice of questioning the prisoner died out continues at page 441:\n\u2026the statutes of Philip and Mary already referred to, repealed and re-enacted in 1826 by 7 Geo. 4, c. 64 authorized committing magistrates to \"take the examination\" of the person suspected. This examination (unless it was taken upon oath, which was regarded as moral compulsion) might be given in evidence against the prisoner.\nThis state of the law continued till the year 1848, when by the 11 and 12 Vic. c. 42, the present system was established, under which the prisoner is asked whether he wishes to say anything, and is warned that if he chooses to do so what he says will be taken down and may be given in evidence on his trial. The result of the whole is that as matters stand the prisoner is absolutely protected against all judicial questioning before or at the trial, and that, on the other hand, he and his wife are prevented from giving evidence in their own behalf. He is often permitted, however, to make any statement he pleases at the very end of the trial, when it is difficult for any one to test the correctness of what is said.\nOn a consideration of the cases and works of text-writers referred to above and of numerous others which were referred to in the full and helpful arguments of counsel I have reached the conclusion that under the law of England as of July 15, 1870, a person charged with murder and awaiting trial could not be compelled to testify at an inquest into the death of the deceased with whose murder he was charged and it is necessary to consider whether this state of the law has been altered by any Act of the Parliament of Canada.\nIt has been submitted that an alteration has been made by the combined effect of ss. 2, 4(1) and 5 of the Canada Evidence Act and ss. 448 and 488(3) of the Criminal Code.\nSections 4(1) and 5 of the Canada Evidence Act have already been quoted. Section 2 is as follows:\n2. This Part applies to all criminal proceedings, and to all civil proceedings and other matters whatsoever respecting which the Parliament of Canada has jurisdiction in this behalf.\nSections 448 and 488(3) of the Criminal Code are as follows:\n448. (1) Where a person is alleged, by a verdict upon a coroner's inquisition, to have committed murder or manslaughter but he has not been charged with the offence, the coroner shall\n(a) direct, by warrant under his hand, that the person be taken into custody and be conveyed, as soon as possible before a justice, or\n(b) direct the person to enter into a recognizance before him with or without sureties, to appear before a justice. (2) Where a coroner makes a direction under subsection (1) he shall transmit to the justice the evidence taken before him in the matter.\n488. (3) \u2026\nNo person shall be tried upon a coroner's inquisition.\nThe effect of the sections of the Canada Evidence Act, referred to above, was to give to a person charged with crime the right to be a witness in his own defence, it was not to enable the prosecution to call him as a witness. The choice as to whether or not he would give evidence was given to the accused alone and if he chose not to testify comment by the judge or by counsel for the prosecution was forbidden. None of this is challenged; but it is said that the sections have the effect of rendering the accused a compellable witness at the inquest into the death which he is charged with having caused by his criminal act.\nIf I am right in the view, which I have already expressed, that in 1870 the accused would not have been a compellable witness at such an inquest, it would, in my opinion, require clear words to bring about so complete a change in the law. Section 5 does not purport to say who shall or shall not be compelled to take the witness stand. It deals with the rights and obligations of a witness who is already on the stand. It does not protect him from the use against him of the answers he makes in the proceeding in which he makes them but only in \"proceedings thereafter taking place\". Let it be supposed that the only evidence given before the coroner which in any way implicated the accused was that of the accused himself; such evidence would warrant the jury in bringing in a verdict alleging that the accused had committed murder or manslaughter. It is true that such a verdict would not constitute an adjudication that the accused was guilty but equally the decision of the justice presiding at the preliminary hearing that the accused should be committed for trial is not such an adjudication. It would be a strange inconsistency if the law which carefully protects an accused from being compelled to make any statement at a preliminary inquiry should permit that inquiry to be adjourned in order that the prosecution be permitted to take the accused before a coroner and submit him against his will to examination and cross-examination as to his supposed guilt. In the absence of clear words in an Act of Parliament or other compelling authority I am unable to agree that that is the state of the law. The conclusion which I have reached necessarily involves the view that Rex v. Barnes, supra, was wrongly decided and ought not to be followed.\nAll that I have so far said is as to the applicable law apart from the provisions of the impugned sections of The Coroners Act. These are as follows:\n8a. (1) Where a person has been charged with a criminal offence arising out of a death, an inquest touching the death shall be held only upon the direction of the Attorney General.\n(2) Where during an inquest any person is charged with a criminal offence arising out of the death, the coroner shall discharge the jury and close the inquest, and shall then proceed as if he had determined that an inquest was unnecessary, provided that the Attorney General may direct that the inquest be reopened.\n***\n15. (1) The coroner and jury shall at the first sitting of the inquest view the body unless a view has been dispensed with under section 9 or 10, and the coroner shall examine on oath, touching the death, all persons who tender their evidence respecting the facts and all persons who in his opinion are likely to have knowledge of relevant facts.\n(2) Subject to subsection (3), no person giving evidence at the inquest shall be excused from answering a question upon the ground that the answer thereto may tend to criminate him or may tend to establish his liability to a civil proceeding at the instance of the Crown or of any person or to a prosecution under any Act of the Legislature, but if he objects to answering the question upon any such ground he shall be entitled to the protection afforded by section 5 of the Canada Evidence Act and by section 33 of the Saskatchewan Evidence Act.\n(3) Before a person gives evidence at the inquest subsection (2) shall be read to him by the coroner.\n(4) A person giving evidence at the inquest may be represented by counsel who may examine and cross-examine witnesses called at the inquest and may on behalf of his client take the objection mentioned in subsection (2).\n***\n20. Counsel appointed by the Attorney General to act for the Crown, at an inquest may attend thereat and may examine or cross-examine the witnesses called, and the coroner shall summon any witness required on behalf of the Crown.\nConsidered by themselves, without regard to the history of the Act, and bearing in mind the rule that the intention to legislate outside its allotted field is not lightly to be imputed to the legislature, these sections could, I think, be construed as not rendering a person charged with an offence arising out of the death compellable to give evidence at the inquest; but when s. 15 as it now reads is contrasted with its predecessor s. 15 which was repealed by Statutes of Saskatchewan, 1960, c. 14, s. 3, this construction scarcely seems possible. The earlier s. 15 read as follows:\nThe coroner and jury shall, at the first sitting of the inquest, view the body, unless a view has been dispensed with under section 9 or 10, and the coroner shall examine on oath, touching the death, all persons who tender their evidence respecting the facts and all persons whom he thinks it expedient to examine as being likely to have knowledge of relevant facts; provided that a person who is suspected of causing the death, or who has been charged or is likely to be charged with an offence relating to the death, shall not be compellable to give evidence at the inquest, and if he does so shall not be cross-examined and provided further that before such person gives any evidence this section shall be read to him by the coroner.\nI think the conclusion inescapable that by enacting s. 15 in its present form the legislature intended to change the law and to render a person charged with murder compellable to give evidence at the inquest on the body of his alleged victim. Such legislation trenches upon the rule expressed in the maxim nemo tenetur seipsum accusare which has been described (by Coleridge J. in R. v. Scott[11] ) as \"a maxim of our law as settled, as important and as wise as almost any other in it.\" This rule has long formed part of the criminal law of England and of this country. With great respect for the contrary view expressed in the Court of Appeal, I am of opinion that any legislation, purporting to make the change in the law referred to in the first sentence of this paragraph or to abrogate or alter the existing rules which protect a person charged with crime from being compelled to testify against himself, is legislation in relation to the Criminal Law including the Procedure in Criminal Matters and so within the exclusive legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada under head 27 of s. 91 of the British North America Act.\nQuestions other than those with which I have dealt above were raised in the course of the argument but I do not find it necessary to deal with them.\nI would allow the appeal, set aside the judgments in the courts below and direct that an order issue prohibiting any coroner in the Province of Saskatchewan from requiring the appellant to attend as a witness or to give evidence at any inquest or at the continuation of any inquest into the death of Allan Thomas. I would make no order as to costs.\nFAUTEUX J. (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal, with leave of this Court, from a unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan[12] dismissing the appeal of the appellant from the judgment of Bence C.J. Q.B. denying appellant's application for a Writ of Prohibition against Coroner J. E. Nunn of Saskatchewan.\nThe material facts may be summarized. One Allan Thomas died at Glaslyn, Saskatchewan, on May 12, 1963 and, on the same day, Coroner Nunn opened an inquest into his death. Later in the day, appellant and eight other persons were arrested and separately charged with the non-capital murder of Thomas. The Coroner then discharged the jury and closed his inquest, as he was required by s. 8a(2) of the Coroners Act, R.S.S. 1953, c. 106, as amended by c. 14 of the 1960 Statutes of Saskatchewan. The following day, May 13, each of the accused was separately arraigned and remanded in custody to await Preliminary Inquiry which, contrary to s. 451(b) of the Criminal Code, was then set at a time exceeding eight clear days, to wit, to June 12, 1963. On May 18, each of the accused was admitted to bail by an order of Disbery J. On the date fixed for the Preliminary Inquiry, June 12, 1963, the Coroner's inquest was reopened by direction of the Attorney General for Saskatchewan and, on the same day, the Preliminary Inquiry was adjourned to an undetermined date, to wit, to the date following the conclusion of the inquest, which, because of the present proceedings, was and now stands adjourned sine die. Whether, in the circumstances, jurisdiction to proceed with the particular \"information\" laid against appellant on May 12, 1963, has been lost as a result of these adjournments of the Preliminary Inquiry, is a question which remains open and one which, if answered affirmatively, destroys the very basis upon which the application for Prohibition is predicated However, and in view of the conclusion I have reached on the other aspects of the case, it is unnecessary to determine this particular question of jurisdiction.\nThe Coroner's inquest, reopened on June 12, 1963, had proceeded for three days during which twenty-three witnesses were examined when, on the fourth day, counsel then acting for the Crown, declared his intention to call and examine as witnesses, pursuant to s. 20 of the Coroners Act, appellant and the other accused who, having been summoned as witnesses, were present before the Coroner. Counsel acting for appellant and the other accused objected to the right of the Coroner or the Crown to compel appellant or any of these persons to give evidence, in view of the fact that each of them had been accused of the murder of Thomas. Having heard the argument related to the merits of this submission, the Coroner eventually ruled that each of them was a compellable witness at his inquest. Hence the application for Prohibition which, as above indicated, was dismissed by Bench C. J. Q.B., as was the appeal entered against this dismissal.\nBence C.J. Q.B. relied mainly on Rex v. Barnes[13]. This case being the leading case in the matter, it is pertinent to consider its circumstances and the views expressed in the various reasons for judgment.\nBarnes was charged with manslaughter in the death of one Rossiter and, after Preliminary Inquiry, was committed to trial by a magistrate. Shortly thereafter,\u2014and not prior to any committal or even the beginning of a Preliminary Inquiry, as in the present case where there was only an \"information\" laid against appellant\u2014,Barnes was subpoenaed to attend a Coroner's inquest into Rossiter's death. Appearing at the inquest, he refused to give evidence or to hold himself bound by the subpoena, on the ground that he was neither a competent nor compellable witness at the inquest at the instance of the Crown, there being pending against him a charge of manslaughter upon which he had been committed to trial. He applied for an Order prohibiting the Coroner from issuing any further process or warrant to compel him to give evidence at the inquest. Orde J., to whom this application was directed in first instance, wrote a considered judgment. He noted particularly the admission made by counsel for Barnes that had the latter been called upon to give evidence before the criminal charge had been laid against him, he would have been bound by reason of the provisions of s. 5 of the Canada Evidence Act to answer any questions put to him, notwithstanding that his answers might tend to criminate him, the only protection afforded him being that his answers could not be used or received in evidence against him in any criminal trial or criminal procedure. Orde J. then said he could find no ground to support the submission that the fact that Barnes was not a compellable witness in the criminal proceedings pending against him exempted him from being compelled to give evidence at the inquest of the Coroner. He said:\nThe competency or the compellability of a person to be called as a witness must be governed by the nature of the proceeding in which that question arises. There is here no real connection between the proceedings before the coroner and those before the Magistrate or the Supreme Court of Ontario in the criminal proceedings.\nThe proceedings therein are entirely distinct. If a civil action were now proceeding, in which the question of the responsibility for the accident in which Rossiter was killed was involved, Barnes could be compelled to give evidence and to answer even though his answers tended to criminate him: Re Ginsberg (1917), 38 D.L.R. 261, 40 O.L.R. 136. And I am unable to see how the fact that he is a defendant in certain criminal proceedings, in which he is not a compellable witness, can entitle him to exemption in all other proceedings. The question of competency or compellability must be determined with reference to the particular proceeding in which it is proposed to call the person as a witness, and not with reference to some other proceeding. And I can see no distinction in principle between the coroner's Court and any other Court in this respect. I cannot, therefore, discover any ground upon which Barnes is entitled to claim exemption from giving evidence upon the inquest now pending.\nWith this view of the law, I am in respectful agreement. The proposition that the competency and compellability of a person to be called as a witness must be determined with reference to the particular proceeding in which it is proposed to call the person as a witness, and not with reference to some other proceeding, is a rule that receives an application even in criminal trials where several persons, though jointly indicted, are proceeded against separately. In such cases, it is settled law that neither one is regarded as an accused person or a party in the trial against the others. This question was particularly considered by the Nova Scotia Supreme Court (in banco) in Re Regan[14] . At page 598, the Court said:\nRegan is not an accused person in the proceedings against Tanner, and the provisions of the Common Law and statute rendering an accused person on his trial not compellable as a witness for the prosecution against himself are therefore not applicable to him. Insofar as any prosecution against Regan himself is concerned, he can avail himself of the provisions of sec. 5 of The Canada Evidence Act R.S. Can., 1927, C. 59) and thus any evidence given by him on the proceedings against Tanner cannot be used against him in the proceedings against himself.\nA similar matter was recently considered by the Court of Appeal in England in William Gerald Boal, Roger John Cordrey[15] . B. and C. were jointly indicated for, inter alia, conspiracy to stop and rob a mail train and for robbery with aggravation. On both counts, B. pleaded not guilty, and C. pleaded guilty to the count of conspiracy but not guilty to the count of robbery. The Court directed that the count of robbery should not be proceeded with with respect to C. without leave of the Court. B. was found guilty on both counts. In appeal, B. sought leave to call what was alleged to be \"fresh evidence\", to wit, the evidence of C. who was said to be then prepared to testify that B. had played the minor part in the affair. The submission that C. would have been a competent but not a compellable witness at the trial of B. under the Criminal Evidence Act, 1898, was rejected. The ratio of the decision is formulated as follows at page 345:\nThis court takes the view that Cordrey was a competent and compellable witness at the trial and that, not being charged with an offence actually within the consideration of the jury at the time, he was not to be regarded as a \"person charged\" within the meaning of section 1 of the Act of 1898.\nThe italics are mine.\nThat this has long been the law in England is shown in Winsor v. The Queen[16] , where it was said that where two prisoners are jointly indicted for felony and plead not guilty, but one only is \"given in charge\" to the jury, the other is an admissible witness although his plea of not guilty remains in the record undisposed of. Thus it appears that, under these provisions of the Criminal Evidence Act and of the Canada Evidence Act which deal with the question of compellability and of competency of a witness, a person \"charged\" is no other than a person who, being accused of an offence, is, at the time when the question arises, actually proceeded against for the offence. In England, a Coroner's inquisition is a mode of criminal prosecution, the finding of a Coroner's inquest accusing a person of causing the death of another, when held by a jury, is equivalent to the preferment and signing of a bill of indictment and the prisoner may be prosecuted upon such inquisition. Archbold, Criminal Pleading Evidence and Practice, Thirty-fifth edition 314. Such is not the case in Canada; and this, with respect to the compellability and competency of a witness, is a fundamental difference. Sections 488 and 448 of the Criminal Code provide:\n488. (1) Except as provided in this Part no bill of indictment shall be preferred.\n(2) No criminal information shall be laid or granted.\n(3) No person shall be tried upon a coroner's inquisition.\n448. (1) Where a person is alleged, by a verdict upon a coroner's inquisition, to have committed murder or manslaughter, but he has not been charged with the offence, the coroner shall\n(a) direct, by warrant under his hand, that the person be taken into custody and be conveyed, as soon as possible, before a justice, or\n(b) direct the person to enter into a recognizance before him with or without sureties, to appear before a justice.\n(2) Where a coroner makes a direction under subsection (1) he shall transmit to the justice the evidence taken before him in the matter.\nThe predecessor to s. 448 was s. 667, the opening words of which were:\n667. Every coroner, upon any inquisition taken before him whereby any person is charged with manslaughter or murder \u2026\nIt is significant that in the 1955 Revision of the Criminal Code, the word \"charged\" appearing in the former section has been replaced in the new by the words \"alleged \u2026 to have committed manslaughter or murder.\" Under our law, there is no party, no accused in a Coroner's inquest and it is only at the conclusion of the inquest that may arise the possibility of a person being alleged to have committed murder or manslaughter and then be compelled, by a Coroner's warrant, to appear in the Criminal Courts. Notwithstanding these fundamental differences between the Coroner's inquest in Canada and in England, it is interesting to note the decision rendered in England in Re Cook[17] . In that case, an application was made to the Court of Queen's Bench, at the instance of the Coroner who was conducting an inquest on the body of one Hannah Moore, for a writ to bring Cook before a Coroner and a jury so that the latter could be identified and give evidence before the Court. At the time of this application, Cook stood committed upon a charge of having wilfully murdered Hannah Moore. The writ was refused. However, this refusal was not founded on the reason that Cook was not a compellable or competent witness, but on the inconveniences attending upon his removal from the place of custody and the lack of sufficient ground being shown for his attendance before the Coroner. Coleridge J., as he then was, said:\nI presume the Court decides that it has power to grant the writ but that no necessity is made out on the present occasion.\nHad the Court been of opinion that Cook was not a compellable and a competent witness, this would have been a peremptory reason and there would have been no occasion to rest the decision on the two grounds of inconvenience or lack of necessity for Cook's appearance at the inquest.\nThe appeal in Rex v. Barnes, supra, was heard by Meredith C.J. C.P. and Riddell, Latchford, Middleton and Lennox JJ. Meredith C.J. C.P. said, at page 51:\nOn principle, therefore, it is not lawful, or proper, to examine the appellant in the coroner's Court in any way regarding the charge which is pending against him, as long as he is in jeopardy in respect of it. But he may, in my opinion, be examined as a witness in regard to the guilt of any other person, so long as the examination does not touch in any way the charge against him.\nand at page 52:\nThe result is that the appellant was wrong in disobeying his subpoena: he may be examined as to the guilt of others so long as the examination does not encroach upon his rights as a person charged with crime.\nWith the exception of Lennox J., who left the question open, none of the other Judges accepted the limitation of the examination suggested by Meredith C.J. C.P. Riddell J., at page 53, stated:\nI can find nothing in our legislation preventing the calling of any one as a witness before the coroner\u2014had Parliament intended to make an exception in the case of one accused or supposed to be accused in some other Court or thought to be guilty of causing the death, no doubt such a provision would have been made in the Code.\nAnd, at page 56, he added:\nMuch has been said as to the alleged hardship upon Barnes' in being compelled to give evidence\u2014it is, however, to be hoped that we have not yet arrived at the point that one accused of crime has so many and so high rights that the people have none. The administration of our law is not a game in which the cleverer and more astute is to win, but a serious proceeding by a people in earnest to discover the actual facts for the sake of public safety, the interest of the public generally. It is the duty of every citizen to tell all he knows for the sake of the people at large, their interest and security, and I am not inclined to stretch in any way rules which are directed to permitting any one to escape from the duties which all others admit and perform\u2014it is for Parliament to frame rules and exceptions, not for the Court. Middleton J., with the concurrence of Latchford J., dealing particularly with s. 5 of the Canada Evidence Act, said at page 57:\nSection 5 deals with this common law privilege and changes the Law, and now no witness shall be excused from answering any question put to him upon the ground that his answering might tend to criminate him. He is, however, granted some degree of protection, for the evidence that he may give shall not be used or receivable in evidence against him. That this protection is by no means as wide as that under the common law rule is obvious, and the change in our law no doubt shocks those whose mental inclination and training leads them to regard the common law privilege as a sacred thing. See, for example, the statement of the late Chief Justice of the King's Bench in Re Ginsberg, (1917) 27 Can. Cr. Cas. 447 where he points out that the protection afforded by the Legislature does not in his view, afford sufficient immunity, as the prosecutors are enabled to get information from the accused which would enable them to get convicting evidence aliunde without using his own evidence against him at all\u2014that in fact the proceedings amount to an examination for discovery in a criminal case, \"which cannot be\". The Appellate Division, 38 D.L.R. 261, did not agree with this view, and in very fully considered judgments upheld not only the validity but the effectiveness of the change in the law.\nFinally Lennox J., having said particularly, at page 59, that he had no right to advise or comment upon the action or attitude of the Crown, concluded that he saw no reason to doubt the correctness of the order appealed against.\nRelying on these various excerpts from the reasons of the Court of Appeal in the Barnes case, supra, Bence C. J. Q.B., who heard the present case in first instance, added that the authority to call the appellant and the other accused as witnesses to give evidence as to their knowledge of what took place was contained in s. 8 (a) and s. 15 of the Coroners Act and also that s. 5 of the Canada Evidence Act stipulated that they should not be excused. He also expressed his disagreement with the limitation suggested by Meredith C. J. C.P. in the Barnes case, supra.\nThe appeal in the Court of Appeal of the Province of Saskatchewan was heard by Culliton C.J.A. and Brownridge, Hall and Maguire JJ. A. At that stage of the proceeding, appellant questioned the validity of ss. 8(a), 15 and 20 of the Coroners Act of Saskatchewan submitting that they were beyond the powers of the provincial legislature in that such sections related to criminal law and procedure. Chief Justice Culliton rendered the judgment for the Court. With respect to the words \"Procedure in Criminal Matters\" appearing in s. 91(27) of the B.N.A. Act, he adopted the meaning ascribed thereto by Macdonald C.J.A., at page 238, in In Re Public Inquiries Act[18] , to wit:\n\"Criminal Matters\" are, in my opinion, proceedings in the criminal Courts, and \"procedure\" means the steps to be taken in prosecutions or other criminal proceedings in such Courts.\nand he concluded:\nIn my opinion, the impugned sections do not relate to steps to be taken in a prosecution or other criminal proceeding, but rather, in pith and substance, relate to the administration of justice within the province and are thus within the competence of the Provincial Legislature.\nHe then said:\nEven if I should be wrong in this conclusion, the position of the appellant would not be improved. The Coroner's Court being a criminal court, the provisions of the Canada Evidence Act apply to its proceedings.\n***\nWhile the Coroner's Court is a criminal Court of record, it is a court of inquiry, not of accusation, and the verdict of a coroner's jury does not bind any person whose conduct may be involved in its findings and does not, in any way, constitute any adjudication of rights affecting either person or property. There is no accused and there are no parties. Wolfe v. Robinson (supra). Notwithstanding that the accused has been charged of an offence arising out of the death being investigated, he appears at the inquest as a witness and, as such, is bound by the provisions of s. 5(1) of the Canada Evidence Act. Rex v. Barnes (supra). In giving evidence he is entitled to the protection given to him by subsection 2 of section 5 and by the corresponding provision of the Saskatchewan Evidence Act.\nWolfe v. Robinson[19] was decided by Wells J. in a very fully considered judgment.\nFinally and with respect to the submission of counsel for the appellant that an application of the law such as the one contended for by respondent would be in contravention of s. 2(e) of the Canadian Bill of Rights, Culliton C.J.A. said that the foregoing section had no application and that s. 2(d) of the Canadian Bill of Rights recognizes the right to compel a person to give evidence if he is represented by counsel and given protection against self-incrimination and that, inasmuch as appellant was represented by counsel at the inquest, he was given the protection envisaged by the Canadian Bill of Rights.\nThe rule nemo tenetur seipsum accusare, invoked on behalf of appellant, has, through the years, been modified or trenched upon by statute and the privileges to which it gave rise have, in certain cases, been conditioned or abrogated. This is illustrated particularly in Walker v. The King[20] and in Re Frilegh[21]. In the Walker case, supra, the Court had to consider the validity of a provincial enactment compelling the person in charge of a vehicle, directly or indirectly involved in an accident, to give certain informations in relation thereto. Sir Lyman Duff C.J., relying particularly on Rex v. Coote[22] , considered the impugned enactment as\na measure for securing information which may be employed for the purposes of legal proceedings, instituted either privately or ad vindicatam publicam\nand stated that\nthere was no rule of law that statements made by an accused under compulsion of statute are, because of such compulsion alone, inadmissible against him in criminal proceedings. Generally speaking, such statements are admissible unless they fall under the scope of some specific enactment or rule excluding them.\nIn Re Frilegh, supra, a debtor objected to submit to an examination, as any questions to be answered might tend to incriminate him on a criminal charge preferred against him for an offence under the Bankruptcy Act. The objection was rejected. The Court relied on an amendment made in 1933, c. 31, s. 33(2), adding subs. (9), and added that even prior to this amendment, a debtor was not entitled to object on the alleged ground in view of Re Ginsberg[23] and in view of the provisions of ss. 2 and 5 of the Canada Evidence Act.\nThe relevant sections of the Canada Evidence Act to be here considered are s. 4(1) and s. 5(1) and (2).\n4. (1) Every person charged with an offence, and, except as in this section otherwise provided, the wife or husband, as the case may be, of the person so charged, is a competent witness for the defence, whether the person so charged is charged solely or jointly with any other person.\nThe words of s. 4(1), here italicized, make it clear that the privilege therein mentioned is conferred to no other than a person charged with an offence, to whom it becomes available on no occasion and time other than when the prosecution against him for that offence is actually proceeded with under the Criminal Code, in the criminal Courts. 5. (1) No witness shall be excused from answering any question upon the ground that the answer to such question may tend to criminate him, or may tend to establish his liability to a civil proceeding at the instance of the Crown or of any person.\n(2) Where with respect to any question a witness objects to answer upon the ground that his answer may tend to criminate him, or may tend to establish his liability to a civil proceeding at the instance of the Crown or of any person, and if but for this Act, or the Act of any provincial legislature, the witness would therefore have been excused from answering such question, then although the witness is by reason of this Act, or by reason of such provincial Act, compelled to answer, the answer so given shall not be used or receivable in evidence against him in any criminal trial, or other criminal proceeding against him thereafter taking place, other than a prosecution for perjury in the giving of such evidence, R.S., c. 59, s. 5.\nBy these provisions, the Canada Evidence Act removes the safeguard a person had at Common Law to refuse to answer any questions that might criminate him. He is now obliged to do so but such evidence may not be used against him if he claims the protection of the Act. The provisions of s. 5 (1) and (2) are unqualified and of general application. Subject only to some specific statutory exceptions of which none applies at a Coroner's inquest, no one\u2014other than a person charged of an offence, on the occasion and at the time at which he is actually proceeded against for that offence\u2014is excused from being called to give evidence on the ground that the answers he might give may tend to incriminate him. If a co-accused, of which the prosecution is not actually proceeded with, under the Criminal Code, in the criminal Courts, is a compellable and competent witness when called to testify in the prosecution of another co-accused, a fortiori a person, whether charged or not with an offence, is a compellable and competent witness at a Coroner's inquest where no one is regarded by law as an accused, at and for the purpose of that inquest, prior to the very time of its conclusion. Being present and represented by counsel before the Coroner when called to the witness stand, appellant's objection to testify could not obtain.\nWith deference to those who entertain a contrary opinion, I am in respectful agreement with the conclusion reached by Orde J. and the Court of Appeal for Ontario in the Barnes case, supra, and with the conclusion reached by Bence C.J. Q.B. and the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan, in the present case, with respect to the application and effect of s. 5 of the Canada Evidence Act. I also agree with the opinion expressed in this case, in the Court below, as to appellant's submission based on the Canadian Bill of Rights; and as to this, I only want to add the following statement of our brother Ritchie, then speaking for the majority of the Court, in Robertson and Rosetanni v. The Queen[24] :\nIt is to be remembered that the human rights and fundamental freedoms recognized by the Courts of Canada before the enactment of the Canadian Bill of Rights and guaranteed by that statute were the rights and freedoms of men living together in an organized society subject to a rational, developed and civilized system of law which imposed limitations on the absolute liberty of the individual.\nIn these views, it is unnecessary to consider the arguments related to the constitutionality of the impugned sections of the Coroners Act of Saskatchewan.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nAppeal allowed, no order as to costs, Fauteux J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellant.

Act, 1867, ss. 91, 92, 96, 101\u2014Supreme Court Act Amendment Act 1964,1964 (B.C.), c. 56\u2014Constitutional Questions Determination Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 72\u2014Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 259, s. 37.\nPursuant to the Constitutional Questions Determination Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 72, the Lieutenant Governor in Council of British Columbia referred to the Court of Appeal the question of determining the validity of part of s. 3 of the Supreme Court Act Amendment Act 1964, 1964 (B.C.), c. 56, which purports to confer jurisdiction in divorce and matrimonial causes upon County Court Judges sitting as local judges of the Supreme Court. By a unanimous judgment, the Court of Appeal held that the impugned legislation was ultra vires. The Attorney General for British Columbia appealed to this Court pursuant to s. 37 of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 259.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nPer Taschereau C.J. and Cartwright, Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ.: The Dominion parliament has not seen fit to pass any legislation pursuant to its power under s. 101 of the B.N.A. Act providing for the establishment of Courts for the administration of the law of marriage and divorce in British Columbia. It was therefore within the legislative competence of the legislature of that province to pass laws relating to the constitution, maintenance and organization of such Courts. By virtue of s. 91(26) of the B.N.A. Act the provincial legislature is precluded from making substantive changes in the law of divorce as it existed in British Columbia at Confederation, but the impugned legislation does not create any substantive right or make any changes in the law or jurisdiction in that regard. The right to grant a divorce in British Columbia remains vested in the Supreme Court as previously, and the effect of the new legislation is limited to reorganizing the administration of justice in that Court by allocating jurisdiction to Courts presided over by local judges of the Supreme Court. It cannot be said that this constitutes provincial legislation purporting to appoint judges of a Superior Court. It can only be characterized as a valid exercise of provincial power under s. 92(14) of the B.N.A. Act. The present legislation is not concerned with conferring jurisdiction \"upon persons\", but with defining the jurisdiction of the Courts. The provisions of s. 92(14) empower the provincial legislature when reorganizing the Courts of the province to allocate jurisdiction in divorce and matrimonial causes to a Court presided over by a judge appointed by the Governor General. This is not a case in which the province has sought to regulate the exercise of the Dominion authority in relation to judicial appointments, it is rather a case in which the legislature has sought to regulate the administration of justice within a province by prescribing the jurisdiction to be exercised by provincial Courts presided over by federally appointed judges. There is no conflict between the impugned legislation and ss. 96 to 101 of the B.N.A. Act.\nPer Judson J.: All County or District Judges are by the terms of their appointment ex officio local judges of the Superior Court in the province in which they are appointed. In British Columbia in that capacity they have long exercised functions assigned to them by provincial legislation, but never as trial judges with complete control over the trial. The present legislation gives them this control in divorce actions but in their capacity as local judges. It is still the Supreme Court that is functioning. Furthermore the province of British Columbia is competent to empower the County Courts to exercise this jurisdiction and no constitutional limitation would arise from s. 96 of the B.N.A. Act if the province were to choose to frame its legislation in this way.\nDroit constitutionnel\u2014Validit\u00e9 d'un statut provincial\u2014Statut conf\u00e9rant aux juges locaux de la Cour supr\u00eame juridiction en mati\u00e8res de divorce\u2014Statut est-il ultra vires\u2014Acte de l'Am\u00e9rique du Nord britannique, 1867 , arts. 91, 92, 96, 101\u2014Supreme Court Act Amendment Act 1964, 1964 (B.C.), c. 56\u2014Constitutional Questions Determination Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 72\u2014Loi sur la Cour supr\u00eame, S.R.C. 1952, c. 259. s. 37.\nConform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la loi intitul\u00e9e Constitutional Questions Determination Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 72, le lieutenant-gouverneur en conseil de la Colombie-Britannique a r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour d'Appel la question de d\u00e9terminer la validit\u00e9 de la partie de l'art. 3 de la loi, intitul\u00e9e Supreme Court Act Amendment Act 1964, 1964 (B.C.), c. 56, dont le but est de conf\u00e9rer la juridiction en mati\u00e8res de divorce aux juges de la Cour de Comt\u00e9 si\u00e9geant comme juges locaux de la Cour supr\u00eame. Par un jugement unanime, la Cour d'Appel jugea que le statut attaqu\u00e9 \u00e9tait ultra vires. Le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la Colombie-Britannique en appela devant cette Cour, en vertu de l'art. 37 de la Loi sur la Cour supr\u00eame, S.R.C. 1952, c. 259.\nArr\u00eat: L'appel doit \u00eatre maintenu.\nLe Juge en Chef Taschereau et les Juges Cartwright, Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Ritchie, Hall et Spence: Le parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral n'a pas jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos d'adopter une l\u00e9gislation en vertu de son pouvoir sous l'art. 101 de l'Acte de l'Am\u00e9rique du Nord britannique pour pourvoir \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ation de Cours pour l'administration de la loi du mariage et du divorce en Colombie-Britannique. La l\u00e9gislature de cette province avait donc la comp\u00e9tence l\u00e9gislative d'adopter des lois concernant la cr\u00e9ation, le maintien et l'organisation de telles Cours. En vertu de l'art. 91(26) le l'Acte de l'Am\u00e9rique du Nord britannique la l\u00e9gislature provinciale ne peut pas faire des changements substantiels dans la loi sur le divorce telle qu'elle existait en Colombie-Britannique lors de la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration, mais la l\u00e9gislation attaqu\u00e9e ne cr\u00e9e aucun droit substantiel ou ne fait aucun changement dans la loi ou la juridiction sur ce sujet. Le droit d'accorder un divorce en Colombie-Britannique demeure investi dans la Cour supr\u00eame tel qu'auparavant, et l'effet de la nouvelle l\u00e9gislation est limit\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9organisation de l'administration de la justice dans cette Cour en conf\u00e9rant la juridiction aux Cours pr\u00e9sid\u00e9es par les juges locaux de la Cour supr\u00eame. On ne peut pas dire que cela constitue une l\u00e9gislation provinciale ayant pour but de nommer des juges \u00e0 une Cour sup\u00e9rieure. On peut caract\u00e9riser cette l\u00e9gislation seulement comme \u00e9tant un exercice valide du pouvoir provincial sous l'art. 92(14) de l'Acte de l'Am\u00e9rique du Nord britannique. La pr\u00e9sente l\u00e9gislation ne vise pas \u00e0 conf\u00e9rer la juridiction \u00ab \u00e0 des personnes \u00bb mais \u00e0 d\u00e9finir la juridiction des Cours. Les dispositions de l'art. 92(14) donnent le pouvoir \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislature provinciale, lorsqu'elle r\u00e9organise les Cours de la province, de conf\u00e9rer la juridiction en mati\u00e8res de divorce \u00e0 une Cour pr\u00e9sid\u00e9e par un juge nomm\u00e9 par le Gouverneur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Il ne s'agit pas ici d'un cas o\u00f9 la province tente de r\u00e9glementer l'exercice de l'autorit\u00e9 f\u00e9d\u00e9rale concernant les nominations judiciaires, mais c'est plut\u00f4t un cas o\u00f9 la l\u00e9gislature a tent\u00e9 de r\u00e9glementer l'administration de la justice dans la province en prescrivant la juridiction \u00e0 \u00eatre exerc\u00e9e par les Cours provinciales pr\u00e9sid\u00e9es par des juges nomm\u00e9s par le f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. Il n'y a aucun conflit entre la l\u00e9gislation attaqu\u00e9e et les arts. 96 \u00e0 101 de l'Acte de l'Am\u00e9rique du Nord britannique.\nLe Juge Judson: Tous les juges de comt\u00e9 ou de district sont de par les termes de leur nomination ex officio des juges locaux de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure dans la province o\u00f9 ils sont nomm\u00e9s. En Colombie-Britannique, en cette capacit\u00e9, ils ont depuis longtemps exerc\u00e9 les fonctions que la l\u00e9gislation provinciale leur a attribu\u00e9es, mais jamais comme juges de premi\u00e8re instance avec contr\u00f4le complet du proc\u00e8s. La pr\u00e9sente l\u00e9gislation leur donne ce contr\u00f4le en mati\u00e8res de divorce mais en leur capacit\u00e9 de juges locaux. C'est toujours la Cour supr\u00eame qui agit. De plus, la province de la Colombie-Britannique est comp\u00e9tente pour donner le pouvoir aux Cours de comt\u00e9 d'exercer cette juridiction, et aucune limite constitutionnelle ne se soul\u00e8verait sous l'art. 96 de l'Acte de l'Am\u00e9rique du Nord britannique si la province d\u00e9cidait de fa\u00e7onner sa l\u00e9gislation de cette mani\u00e8re.\nAPPEL d'un jugement de la Cour d'appel de la Colombie-Britannique[1], d\u00e9clarant que partie de l'art. 3 de la loi intitul\u00e9e Supreme Court Act Amendment Act 1964 \u00e9tait ultra vires.

(1) Judges of the several County Courts are Judges of the Court for the purposes of their jurisdiction in actions in the Court, and in the exercise of such jurisdiction may be styled \"Local Judges of the Supreme Court of British Columbia\", and have in all causes and matters in the Court, subject to Rules of Court, power and authority to do and perform all such acts and transact all such business, in respect of causes and matters in and before the Court, as they are by statute or Rules of Court in that behalf from time to time empowered to do and perform.\n(2) Without thereby limiting the generality of the provisions of subsection (1), it is declared that the jurisdiction of the Judges of the several County Courts as Local Judges of the Supreme Court extends to the exercising of all such powers and authorities, and the performing of all such acts, and the transacting of all such business as may be exercised, performed, or transacted by the Supreme Court or any Judge thereof under the provisions of\n(a) the Administration Act, or by virtue of any Statute or of any law in force in the Province in respect of matters or causes relating to the grant or revocation of probate of wills or letters of administration; (b) the Bills of Sale Act;\n(b1) the Adoption Act;\n(c) the Companies Act;\n(d) the Creditors' Relief Act;\n(d1) the Divorce and Matrimonial Causes Act as amended by the Divorce Jurisdiction Act and by the Marriage and Divorce Act of Canada;\n(e) the Equal Guardianship of Infants Act;\n(f) the Infants Act;\n(g) the Land Registry Act;\n(h) the Quieting Titles Act;\n(i) the Trustee Act;\n(j) the Water Act.\nThe constitutional validity of clause (d1) of the amended subsection is challenged on the grounds that it is legislation in relation to \"marriage and divorce\", a field which is assigned to the exclusive legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada by s. 91(26) of the British North America Act, and that it purports to authorize judicial appointments which by the terms of s. 96 of that Act are required to be made by the Governor-General.\nThe Court of Appeal phrased these questions in the following terms:\n(1) Whether the Province may legislate in respect of Divorce and Matrimonial Causes.\n(2) Whether such legislation is an appointment within the power of the Governor\u2014General in Council under Section 96 of the B.N.A. Act.\nThe well known provisions of s. 96 read as follows:\nThe Governor General shall appoint the Judges of the Superior, District and County Courts in each Province, except those of the Courts of Probate in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.\nMr. Justice Tysoe, with whose conclusions the other members of the Court of Appeal agreed, held the impugned legislation to be ultra vires on the second of the above grounds and accordingly found it unnecessary to express a final opinion with respect to the contention that the amendment constituted legislation in relation to \"marriage and divorce\". Mr. Justice Sheppard however, having discussed the historical origins of the divorce jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, proceeded to hold:\n\u2026that the Legislature of British Columbia under Section 92(14) of the British North America Act has legislative jurisdiction to constitute a Court having original jurisdiction in divorce, and in creating the organization of the Court, to designate the offices within the Court and their jurisdiction in divorce equally as in other matters; Watts v. Watts, 1908 A.C. 573; Walker v. Walker, 1919 A.C. 947; Board v. Board, 1919 A.C. 956. That would enable the legislature to create the office of Local Judge and to define the jurisdiction thereof, subject always to any Dominion legislation under Section 101 of the British North America Act by reason of divorce coming within Section 91 ss. 26.\nThe case of Watts v. Watts[4] clearly recognized the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of British Columbia in matters of divorce as having been acquired by virtue of the pre-Confederation adoption in that Province of the Divorce and Matrimonial Causes Act passed in England in 1857. In the course of the opinion delivered by Lord Collins on behalf of the Privy Council in that case, express approval is given to the judgment of Martin, J. In Sheppard v. Sheppard[5], where the following passage occurs:\nMoreover, while on the one hand it is true that the Legislature of a Province has no power to legislate in divorce matters so far as expending or contracting the jurisdiction in that respect possessed by its Courts before the Union, yet on the other hand it is equally true that the Court itself has inherent power to make rules regulating its procedure, and that power the Provincial Legislature can take from it in divorce matters as it has in all other matters in this Court, and therefore may, in this sense, legislate by rules of court or otherwise, respecting the regulation of the procedure by which the unalterable Ante-Union jurisdiction may be exercised. Under section 92(14) of the British North America Act the Provincial Legislatures have the exclusive power to constitute, maintain, and organize Courts for the purpose of exercising all jurisdictions whether acquired before or after the Union\u2014Regina v. Bush (1888), 15 Ont. 398; In re Small Debts Act (1896), 5 B.C. 246. This view is indeed in effect that which is expressed by Clement, J., in his Canadian Constitution (1904), p. 235, note:\nIt is submitted that, given a law permitting divorce, the administration of that law would prima facie fall to Provincial Courts, constituted under Provincial legislation\u2014subject always, of course, to the power of the Dominion Parliament to constitute additional Courts, under s. 101, and to regulate procedure in divorce cases, if so disposed.\nThe Dominion Parliament has not seen fit to pass any legislation pursuant to its power under s. 101 of the British North America Act providing for the establishment of courts for the administration of the law of \"marriage and divorce\" in British Columbia and I am accordingly in agreement with Mr. Justice Sheppard that it is within the legislative competence of the Legislature of that Province to pass laws relating to the constitution, maintenance and organization of such courts. The Provincial Legislature is by virtue of the provisions of s. 91(26) of the British North America Act precluded from making substantive changes in the law of divorce as it existed in British Columbia at the time when that Province entered into Confederation, but the impugned legislation does not in my opinion create any substantive right or make any changes in the law or jurisdiction in that regard. The right to grant a divorce in British Columbia remains vested in the Supreme Court as it previously did and the effect of the new legislation is limited to reorganizing the administration of justice in that Court by allocating jurisdiction under the Divorce and Matrimonial Causes Act (as amended by federal legislation) to courts presided over by Local Judges of the Supreme Court appointed by the Governor-General, and unless it can be said that this constitutes provincial legislation purporting to appoint judges of a superior court, it appears to me that it can only be characterized as a valid exercise of provincial power under s. 92(14) which reads as follows:\n92. In each Province the Legislature may exclusively make Laws in relation to Matters coming within the Classes of Subjects next herein-after enumerated; that is to say, \u2026\n14. The Administration of Justice in the Province, including the Constitution, Maintenance, and Organization of Provincial Courts, both of Civil and of Criminal Jurisdiction, and including Procedure in Civil Matters in those Courts.\nThe reasoning which led Tysoe J.A. to the conclusion that the legislation in question constitutes an attempt by the Province to exercise the power of appointing superior court judges which is vested in the Governor-General under s. 96 of the British North America Act, is summarized in the following excerpt from his reasons for judgment:\nThe effect of the legislation in question is to confer upon County Court Judges, acting as Local Judges of the Supreme Court, power to fully and finally adjudicate upon the rights of the parties in Supreme Court actions for divorce and judicial separation as fully and effectually as Supreme Court Judges can do. This jurisdiction given to the County Court Judges is to be exercised in the Supreme Court and their judgments will be judgments of the Supreme Court. In my opinion this is a clear case of constituting Judges of the County Court Judges of the Supreme Court. What else are they, notwithstanding their designation as Local Judges, if they can and do exercise the jurisdiction, powers and functions and all their actions and judgments are those of Supreme Court Judges. It is true that the jurisdiction is limited to one branch of law; but it is unlimited within that sphere, and is subject only, with respect to their final judgments, to appeals to the Court in the same way as final judgments of any ordinary and properly appointed judges of the Supreme Court. In my opinion this limitation does not affect the position. It is also my opinion that the Provincial Legislature has no more power to confer such a jurisdiction upon persons who have been appointed by the Dominion to the County Courts and as Local Judges of the Supreme Court with the powers set out in their Letters Patent, than it has to confer it upon provincially appointed Masters, Magistrates or other persons.\nThe italics are my own.\nWith the greatest respect, it appears to me that the present legislation is not concerned with conferring jurisdiction \"upon persons\" but with defining the jurisdiction of courts. The distinction between a provincial legislature conferring jurisdiction upon courts presided over by provincially appointed officials on the one hand and upon courts to which the Governor-General has appointed judges on the other hand, is that in the former case the provincially appointed official is excluded by reason of the origin of his appointment from exercising jurisdiction broadly conforming to the type exercised by superior, district or county courts, (see In re The Adoption Act[6], In re Labour Relations Board of Saskatchewan v. John East Iron Works[7] and Attorney General for Ontario and Display Services Company Limited v. Victoria Medical Building Limited[8] ), whereas it is within the exclusive power of the provincial legislature to define the jurisdiction of provincial courts presided over by federally appointed judges, and as Strong J. observed in In re County Courts of British Columbia[9] :\n\u2026if the jurisdiction of the courts is to be defined by the provincial legislatures that must necessarily also involve the jurisdiction of the judges who constitute such courts.\nSee also A. A. Dupon v. Inglis[10] , per Rand J. at 542.\nSince 1891 (Statutes of British Columbia 1891, c. 8) the provincial legislation has provided for \"Local Judges of the Supreme Court of British Columbia\" to preside over courts transacting business in causes and actions in the Supreme Court of British Columbia to such extent \"as they are by statute or rules of court in that behalf from time to time empowered to do \u2026\" and although these judges are judges of the County Courts they are specifically appointed as Local Judges under a patent issued by the Governor-General in Council which reads as follows:\nKNOW YOU that, reposing trust and confidence in your loyalty, integrity, and ability, we did, on the day of, in the year of Our Lord One thousand nine hundred and, and in the year of Our Reign, constitute and appoint you the said to be\nA LOCAL JUDGE OF THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA\nTO HAVE, hold, exercise and enjoy the said office of a Local Judge of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, unto you the said with all and every the powers, rights, authority, privileges, profits, emoluments and advantages unto the said office of right and by Law appertaining during your good behaviour and your tenure of office as a Judge of the County Court of , in the Province of British Columbia.\nThe form of the Minute of the Privy Council authorizing such appointment reads as follows:\nThe Committee of the Privy Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice, advise that of the City of in the Province of British Columbia, Barrister at Law, be appointed a Judge of the County Court of in the said Province, effective February 1st, 1965.\nThe Committee further advise that the said be appointed a Local Judge of the Supreme Court of British Columbia during his tenure of office as a Judge of the said County Court.\nThere can thus be no doubt that \"Local Judges of the Supreme Court of British Columbia\" are appointed by the Governor-General in Council, but it is contended that under the impugned legislation Judges of the County Court in their capacity as \"Local Judges of the Supreme Court\" are empowered to exercise jurisdiction formerly reserved to Judges of the Superior Court, to whom, unlike the Judges of the County Courts, security of tenure is guaranteed in accordance with s. 99 of the British North America Act which reads as follows:\nThe Judges of the Superior Courts shall hold Office during good Behaviour, but shall be removable by the Governor General on Address of the Senate and House of Commons.\nThe complaint is that the legislation has the effect of authorizing persons to preside over Courts exercising the jurisdiction of superior courts who have not been appointed in accordance with this section. In the present case, however, the patents issued to Local Judges by the Governor-General expressly appoint them to that office \"during good behaviour\" although the term of the appointment is limited to the period during which the appointee remains a Judge of the County Court. In my opinion the provisions of s. 92(14) empower the provincial legislature when reorganizing the courts of the Province to allocate jurisdiction in divorce and matrimonial causes to a court presided over by a judge who is so appointed.\nIt is contended also that the impugned legislation is in excess of the powers of the provincial legislature in that it restricts the persons eligible to be \"Local Judges of the Supreme Court\", with power to exercise the jurisdiction of a Superior Court Judge, to \"Judges of the several County Courts\" and thus curtails the unlimited right of selection of judges of the Superior Court which is vested in the Governor-General in Council under s. 96 of the British North America Act. The latter proposition is forcefully stated by Davey J.A. in the last paragraph of his reasons for judgment in the Court of Appeal where he says:\nThe letters patent of the Governor-General appointing the several County Court judges to be local judges of the Supreme Court are not valid appointments of superior court judges under section 96, since the Supreme Court Act passed by the provincial legislature specifies who the local judges shall be and thereby in effect requires the Governor-General to appoint the County Court judges to be the local judges, or to make no appointment at all, instead of leaving the Governor-General free to exercise his power at large, subject only to the provisions of the Judges Act, as section 96 intends.\nIn support of this contention reliance is placed on the decision of the Privy Council in Attorney General for Ontario v. Attorney General for Canada[11] , dismissing an appeal from the decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario which is reported as Re Judicature Act[12]. By the legislation there in question, the Lieutenant-Governor in Council was directed to assign the judges of the Supreme Court who were to constitute the Appellate Division of that Court and it was provided that one of their number was to be designated by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council as President of that division and to be called Chief Justice of Ontario and that the judges not so assigned were to be judges of the High Court Division, one of whom was to be designated by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council as Chief Justice of that division. This legislation was found to be ultra vires on the ground that it constituted a colourable attempt to vest in the Lieutenant-Governor in Council the powers reserved to the Governor-General in Council by s. 96, and in a very short judgment in the Privy Council Lord Cave said, at page 753:\nWhat is the effect of these provisions? It can hardly be doubted that the result of them is to authorize the Lieutenant-Governor of the province to assign\u2014that is to say, to appoint\u2014certain judges of the High Court to be judges of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, and also to designate\u2014that is to say, to appoint\u2014certain judges to hold the offices of Chief Justice of Ontario and Chief Justice of the High Court Division. If that is the real effect of the statute, as it appears to be, there can be no doubt that the effect of the statute, if valid, would be to transfer the right to appointment of the two Chief Justices and the judges of Appeal from the Governor-General of Canada to the Lieutenant-Governor of Ontario in Council; and if so, it must follow that the statute is to that extent inconsistent with s. 96 of the Act of 1867 and beyond the powers of the Legislature of Ontario.\nIn my view there is a fundamental difference between the question dealt with in that case and the one which is raised by the present appeal; it is the difference between the power to designate or appoint individual judges of the Superior and County Courts which is vested in the federal authority and the power to define the jurisdiction of the courts over which those judges are to preside, which in civil matters is exclusively within the provincial field. This is not, in my opinion, a case in which the province has sought to regulate the exercise of the dominion authority in relation to judicial appointments by prescribing the class of persons from whom the appointments to judicial office shall be selected, it is rather a case in which the legislature has sought to regulate the administration of justice within a province by prescribing the jurisdiction to be exercised by provincial courts presided over by federally appointed judges.\nI see no conflict between the legislation here in question and ss. 96 to 101 of the British North America Act and I would accordingly allow this appeal and direct that the question referred to the Court of Appeal of British Columbia be answered in the affirmative.\nJUDSON J.:\u2014British Columbia legislation has conferred upon local judges of the Supreme Court of British Columbia jurisdiction in divorce concurrent with that of the Supreme Court of British Columbia. Since the questions raised by Clement J., in the first instance in 1907, were settled in the Privy Council in Watts & A.G.B.C. v. Watts[13] , there has been no doubt that the Supreme Court of British Columbia has this jurisdiction. The question here for determination is whether the province under s. 92(14) can confer concurrent jurisdiction on local judges of the Supreme Court. It is apparent and the reasons delivered in the British Columbia Court of Appeal recognize this, that the only possible constitutional limitation arises from s. 96 of the British North America Act.\nAll the judges in British Columbia[14] have held that there does exist such a limitation and that the legislation is invalid. Their reason is that the legislation offends s. 96 of the British North America Act because it makes a local judge of the Supreme Court, who is in reality a County Court Judge, into a Judge of the Supreme Court of British Columbia. I do not think that it does. The case is widely different from Ontario legislation considered in the Reference in 1924, which attempted to limit the Governor General's power under s. 96 to appointing judges generally to the Supreme Court of Ontario and purported to reserve to the province the power to assign those judges to the High Court of Justice for trial work and to the Appellate Division and to appoint the Chief Justices. It is also widely different from Display Services[15] , where provincial legislation attempted to confer upon a judicial officer not appointed under s. 96 the jurisdiction of a judge in Mechanics Lien actions.\nThe Attorney General for British Columbia and the Attorney General for Canada both support the legislation but on different grounds. The Attorney General for British Columbia says that the province can redistribute this item of jurisdiction within s. 96 courts generally and that this power is all the more plain where the recipient of the jurisdiction is a local judge of the Supreme Court. The Attorney General for Canada says that because of the Dominion power over divorce and because jurisdiction is now in the Supreme Court of British Columbia, it is the fact that the county judge is a local judge of the Supreme Court by Dominion appointment that saves the legislation. The divorce will still be granted in the Supreme Court of British Columbia with the local judge presiding. There is really no problem here. All county or district judges are by the terms of their appointment ex officio local judges of the Superior Court in the province in which they are appointed. In British Columbia in that capacity they have long exercised functions assigned to them by provincial legislation, but never as trial judges with complete control over the trial. The present legislation does give them this control in divorce actions but in their capacity as local judges. It is still the Supreme Court that is functioning.\nI would go further and hold, contrary to the submission of the Attorney General of Canada, that the Province of British Columbia is competent to empower the county courts to exercise this jurisdiction and that no constitutional limitation would arise from s. 96 of the British North America Act, if the province were to choose to frame its legislation in this way.\nI would allow the appeal.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: M.

Default having occurred in a payment of the instalments of indebtedness due by R to the credit union, the credit union notified his employer (E Co.) on November 27, 1962, of the assignment of wages. On January 8, 1963, R made an assignment in bankruptcy to the respondent company and its position as trustee was subsequently confirmed by a meeting of creditors. The credit union was notified by the trustee of the fact of the assignment and was supplied with a proof of claim form but never filed any proof of claim or appeared in the bankruptcy.\nOn March 14, 1963, the trustee notified E Co. that it required the said company to pay to it the funds deducted from R\u2019s wages up till that date. E. Co. took the position that it would hold the money pending an order of the Court declaring the assignment of wages to be void and unenforceable. An application for that declaration was made on behalf of the trustee on March 29, 1963, and it was so declared on May 6, 1963. The judgment of the lower Court was confirmed, on appeal, by the Court of Appeal, and the credit union by special leave further appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and judgment should issue dismissing the application of the trustee for a declaration that the assignment of wages made by the bankrupt to the appellant was unenforceable against the trustee of the estate.\nUnder s. 39(a) of the Bankruptcy Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 14, the property of the bankrupt did not comprise property held by the bankrupt in trust for any other person. So soon as the after-acquired wages were due to the bankrupt then the assignment operated in equity to transfer the property therein to the assignee. Lundy v.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, affirming a judgment of Smily J. Appeal allowed.\nL.W. Houlden, Q.C., and D.E. Baird, for the appellant.\nR.H. Frayne, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nSPENCE J.:\u2014This is an appeal by special leave from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario pronounced on September 12, 1963. The judgment of that Court confirmed that of the Honourable Mr. Justice Smily pronounced May 6, 1963, in which he declared\nthat the assignment of wages made by the said bankrupt, Herbert L\u00e9ger Robitaille, to the Holy Rosary Credit Union dated the 10th of April 1962, and presently filed with the Empire Rug Mills Limited, employer of the said bankrupt, on the 27th day of November 1962, is void and unenforceable as against the said The Premier Trust Company, Trustee of the estate of the said bankrupt, and it is ordered and adjudged accordingly.\nOn April 10, 1962, the said Herbert L\u00e9ger Robitaille borrowed certain funds from the Holy Rosary (Thorold) Credit Union Limited and on that date gave to the Credit Union an assignment of 30 per cent of all the wages, salary, commission, or other moneys owing to him or thereafter to become owing to him, or earned by him in the employ of the Empire Rug Mills Limited, or any other person, firm or corporation by whom he might thereafter be employed. Default having occurred in a payment of the instalments of indebtedness due by the said Robitaille to the Credit Union, the Credit Union notified his employer, Empire Rug Mills Limited, on November 27, 1962, of the assignment of wages.\nOn January 8, 1963, the said Robitaille made an assignment in bankruptcy to the Premier Trust Company Limited and its position as trustee was confirmed by a meeting of creditors held on January 22, 1963. The appellant Credit Union was notified by the trustee of the fact of the assignment and was supplied with a proof of claim form but never filed any proof of claim or appeared in the bankruptcy.\nOn March 14, 1963, the trustee by letter notified the Empire Rug Mills Limited that it required the said company to pay to it the funds deducted from Robitaille\u2019s wages up till that date. The Empire Rug Mills Limited took the position that it would hold the money pending an order of the Court declaring the assignment of wages dated April 10, 1962, to be void and unenforceable. An: application for that declaration was made on behalf of the trustee on March 29, 1963, and Smily J. so declared on May 6, 1963.\nOn May 23, 1963, the bankrupt Robitaille applied for and obtained his unconditional discharge from the bankruptcy.\nNo reasons in writing were delivered by the Court of Appeal but Smily J. in giving judgment said:\nI am, of course, bound by the judgment in the Lundy v. Niagara Falls Railway Employees Credit Union case, [1960] O.W.N. 539, 1 C.B.R. (N.S.) 201, 26 D.L.R. (2d) 47.\nThere are two distinctions between that decision and the present case. In the first place, in the Lundy v. Niagara Falls case, the only notice of the assignment to the employer was given after the bankruptcy. This was relied upon by the Credit Union in the present case in the argument before Smily J. but in this Court counsel for the Credit Union placed no reliance at all on such distinction. Secondly, in the Lundy v. Niagara Falls case, the creditor filed a claim in bankruptcy and although it did not value its security its manager was nominated as the sole inspector of the estate and actively engaged in the administration of the bankruptcy. As I shall point hereafter, that circumstance might well have determined the action in favour of the trustee as it would appear that in so doing the Credit Union had released its security.\nThe only other authority in Canada dealing with the issue as between the assignee of future wages and the trustee in bankruptcy which was cited to us or which I could discover would seem to be In re Hunt[1], in which Graham J. held in the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench of Saskatchewan that such assignment was valid as against the trustee despite the creditor\u2019s failure to notify the employer until after the bankruptcy occurred, and despite the fact that the creditor had filed a claim in the bankruptcy. In re Hunt does not seem to have been referred to in the consideration in the Court of Appeal of the Lundy v. Niagara Falls case, supra. The definition of \u201cproperty\u201d in s. 2(o) of the Bankruptcy Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 14, reads as follows:\n(o) \u201cproperty\u201d includes money, goods, things in action, land, and every description of property, whether real or personal, movable or immovable, legal or equitable, and whether situate in Canada or elsewhere and includes obligations, easements and every description of estate, interest and profit, present or future, vested or contingent, in, arising out of, or incident to property.\nDisregarding for the moment the assignment of the wages, there is no doubt that in Canada after-acquired wages or salaries of a bankrupt, subject to a fair and reasonable allowance to the debtor for maintenance of himself and his family, go to the trustee as property of the bankrupt: In re Tod, Clarkson v. Tod[2], and Industrial Acceptance Corporation and T. Eaton Co. Ltd. of Montreal v. Lalonde[3].\nIn my opinion, it is equally well established that an assignment for valuable consideration of property to be obtained in the future is a valid equitable assignment and one which is enforceable in equity so soon as the property comes into the possession of the assignor: Tailby v. Official Receiver[4].\nIn re Lind, Industrial Finance Syndicate v. Lind[5], Swinfen Eady L.J. said at p. 895:\nIt is clear from these authorities that an assignment for value of future property actually binds the property itself, directly if it is acquired, automatically on the happening of the event, and without any further act on the part of the assignor, and does not merely rest in and amount to a right in contract giving rise to an action. The assignor, having received the consideration, becomes in equity, on the happening of the event, trustee for the assignee of the property devolving upon or acquired by him, and which he had previously sold and been paid for.\nPhillimore L.J., said at p. 897:\nBut, notwithstanding these allusions to the specific performance of contracts, it is, I think, well and long settled that the right of the assignee is a higher right than the right to have specific performance of a contract, that the assignment creates an equitable charge, which arises immediately upon the property coming into existence. Either then no further act of assurance from the assignor is required, or, if there be something necessary to be done by him to pass the legal estate or complete the title, he has to do it, not by reason of a covenant for further assurance, the persistence of which, through bankruptcy, it is unnecessary to discuss, but because it is due from him as trustee for his assignee. Bankes L.J., said at p. 902:\nIt appears to me to be manifest from these statements of the law that equity regarded an assignment for value of future-acquired property as containing an enforceable security as against the property assigned quite independent of the personal obligation of the assignor arising out of his imported covenant to assign. It is true that the security was not enforceable until the property came into existence, but nevertheless the security was there, and the assignor was the bare trustee of the assignee to receive and hold the property for him when it came into existence.\nThe Lind case was not one of an assignment of wages to be earned in the future but it was an assignment of property to be acquired in the future, and a bankruptcy did follow the assignment.\nIndeed, the valid and enforceable character of the assignment as an equitable assignment was upheld by the Court of Appeal for Ontario in Niagara Falls Railway Employees Credit Union v. International Nickel Co. Ltd[6] In that Court, the argument that such an assignment was contrary to public policy was also disposed of. Such an argument was suggested in this Court upon the present argument but it was not relied upon. If the assignment of the wages to be acquired thereafter is a valid, equitable assignment and creates a valid, equitable security, there is no reason why the property of the debtor in those after-acquired wages should not pass to the trustee subject to such security. In my view, such result is not affected materially by the decisions in a series of cases exemplified by Re Jones, Ex. p. Nichols[7]. In those cases, the debtor with the permission of the trustee continued to carry on a business after his bankruptcy. Of course, it is trite law that any property acquired in the conduct of that business becomes the property of the trustee in bankruptcy.\nThere are two interesting decisions in the English Courts in fairly late years. The first is King v. Michael Faraday and Partners Ltd.[8], which was a decision of Atkinson J. There the debtor had been the managing director of a company under agreement which assured him a very large salary until 1941. In 1933 a judgment for \u00a334,000 odd was awarded against him and to avoid proceedings upon the judgment he assigned certain insurance policies to his creditor and also assigned to him \u00a31,000 per annum to be paid out of his salary for a period of ten years. To effect the latter assignment, the debtor signed an irrevocable request and authority to the company to make such payments to the creditor. In 1938, after payment had been made for five years, the company was obliged to reduce the debtor\u2019s salary to \u00a31,000 per annum and at about the same time a receiving order was made against the debtor. The trustee in bankruptcy allowed the debtor to retain his salary of \u00a31,000 per annum for the maintenance of himself and his family. The personal representative of the original creditor proved in the bankruptcy for the whole amount of the debt without ever giving credit for or without valuing any security. The creditor\u2019s solicitor was a member of the committee of inspection, attended meetings and voted in respect of the full amount of \u00a324,000 for which she had filed her proof of claim. The creditor then took action to enforce as an equitable assignment the claim against the debtor\u2019s salary. The case was set down to be argued as a preliminary issue of law under Ord. 25, r. 2, in English Practice. Atkinson J. gave effect to what he described as \u201cthree much more formidable defences\u201d. The first of these was frustration by the reduction of the debtor\u2019s salary to \u00a31,000 per year which, at any rate, in the opinion of the trustee, was merely sufficient to permit him to maintain himself and his family. The second was that by proving in the bankruptcy for the full amount of her judgment the plaintiff, the creditor, had elected to take her remedy in the bankruptcy rather than by the enforcement of her security. The third was that the assignment was, under the circumstances, contrary to public policy. It may be noted that the second defence to which Atkinson J. gave effect was sufficient to dispose of the case of Lundy v. Niagara Falls Railway Employees Credit Union, supra, and that no such situation maintains in the present case where the creditor has not proved in the bankruptcy. It should be further noted that the respondent in the present case could, by virtue of s. 10S of the Bankruptcy Act, have required the secured creditor to file his claim, and by virtue of s. 87(1) of the same statute have demanded that the secured creditor value his security. Had the secured creditor done so, it would have been subject to having the claim redeemed by the trustee. The third defence to which Atkinson J. gave effect, i.e., the bar of public policy, has been disposed of in Niagara Falls Railway Employees Credit Union v. International Nickel Co. Ltd., supra. Moreover, by s. 7(6) of The Wages Act, R.S.O.1960, c. 421, effective on March 29, 1961, any contract made thereafter which provided for the assignment by the debtor to the creditor of a portion of not more than 30 per cent of the wage earner\u2019s wages to be earned in the future was not invalid. The assignment of wages in the present case was made on April 10, 1962. However, in King v. Faraday Ltd., supra, Atkinson J., before dealing with those three defences, all of which he sustained, considered the question of whether an assignment of after-acquired wages was valid as against a trustee in bankruptcy. At p. 484, he said:\nThe next point which was made was this. It was argued that a man cannot charge his personal earnings to be made during a bankruptcy, because such earnings become, so it was said, due not merely to the debtor, but also to the trustee in cases like Re Jones, Ex. p. Nichols (1883), 22 Ch. D. 782, and Wilmot v. Alton, [1897] 1 Q.B. 17, and that class of case, upon which reliance was placed. If those cases are analysed, it will be seen that in all of them the earnings in dispute were made, not by the bankrupt, but by the trustee. If a trustee permits a debtor to carry on his business, he carries it on as agent for the trustee, and it is true to say that the earnings are really the earnings of the trustee, and not of the debtor. In this case, however, the debtor is carrying on under a personal agreement. He is not carrying on in any sense as agent for the trustee. At any rate, so far as I am concerned, I am not prepared to hold that a man cannot before bankruptcy charge his personal earnings under a personal agreement over and above what is required for the maintenance of himself and his family so as to give good title against his trustee. Therefore, I think that the argument based on Re Jones, Ex. p. Nichols, supra, fails as well.\nIn Re De Marney, Official Receiver v. Salaman[9], Farwell J., in the Chancery Division, considered this situation. A debtor by a deed made before bankruptcy undertook to pay to the trustee under the arrangement one-half of all earnings less income tax. Thereafter, he was adjudged bankrupt. The question to be determined was whether the trustee in bankruptcy was entitled to the bankrupt\u2019s earn- ings after the date of adjudication, having regard to the terms of the deed of arrangement. Farwell J., in a very brief judgment, stated:\nThe question is whether the trustee in bankruptcy is entitled to be paid the moneys earned by the bankrupt since the date of the adjudication, having regard to the terms of the deed. If this was a charge of future profits of a business, there would, I think, be no doubt that the trustee in bankruptcy would be entitled to them. It is said, however, that this is not a case of the future profits of a business, but a charge upon the future proposed earnings of the bankrupt and that in this case different considerations arise. I have looked at the various cases which were cited to me and have considered them with care, and I am quite unable to find sufficient justification for saying that the principle applicable to future earnings of a business does not apply to the present case.\nI am unable to accept this terse decision and I prefer the very carefully reasoned judgment of Atkinson J. in King v. Faraday Ltd., supra, based as the latter judgment is on the authority of Tailby v. Official Receiver, supra, and Re Lind, supra.\nLaidlaw J.A., in giving the judgment for the Court of Appeal in Lundy v. Niagara Falls Railway Employees Credit Union, supra, quoted Williams on Bankruptcy, 17th ed., at p. 75, as follows:\nAt common law a document purporting to be an assignment of property thereafter to be acquired by the assignor passes no property to the assignee unless and until there be, besides the acquisition of the property by the assignor, some actus interveniens, such as seizure by the assignee; but in equity, although a contract engaging to transfer property not in existence as the property of the assignor cannot operate as an immediate alienation, yet, if the assignor afterwards becomes possessed of property answering the description in the contract, it will transfer the beneficial interest to the purchaser immediately upon the property being acquired, provided it appear therefrom that such is the intention of the parties; but not if it appear that the intention of the parties is that there shall be merely a power to seize after-acquired property as distinguished from an interest therein on its acquirement.\nAnd continued:\nThat statement of law must be read with s. 39 of the Bankruptcy Act, quoted supra. I can find no ambiguity in the relevant language of that section and no doubt arises therefrom in my mind. The wages earned and falling due to the appellant after he made an assignment in bankruptcy did not form part of his property at the date of the assignment in bankruptcy. He acquired the right to those wages after his bankruptcy and before his discharge. In my opinion, that right became property of the bankrupt appellant and vested in the trustee in bankruptcy by virtue of s. 39 of the Bankruptcy Act. But by the very terms of s. 39(a), the property of the bankrupt shall not comprise property held by the bankrupt in trust for any other person. And the whole import of the cases which I have cited, supra, is to the effect that so soon as those after-acquired wages are duo to the bankrupt then the assignment operates in equity to transfer the property therein to the assignee.\nI am, therefore, of the opinion that the appeal should be allowed and that judgment should issue dismissing the application of the trustee for a declaration that the assignment of wages made by the bankrupt to the Holy Rosary Credit Union dated April 10, 1962, is unenforceable against the trustee of the estate. The effect of the discharge of the bankrupt upon the appellant\u2019s right to obtain a portion of the wages earned by the bankrupt after his discharge is not an issue in this appeal, and I express no view thereon. Pursuant to the terms imposed when leave to appeal to this Court was granted there will be no order as to costs in the Courts below and the appellant will pay to the respondent its party and party costs in this Court.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Young & McNamara, Thorold.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Freeman & Frayne, St. Catharines.\n[1] (1954), 34 C.B.R. 120, 12 W.W.R.

Metropolitan Corporation of Greater Winnipeg, [1965] S.C.R. 512\nDate: 1965-04-09\nGordon Blanchard Wiswell, William Arthur Johnston and Geraldine Mary Wilson, suing on behalf of themselves and of all other members of the Crescentwood Home Owners Association (Plaintiffs) Appellants;\nand\nThe Metropolitain Corporation of Greater Winnipeg (Defendant) Respondent.\n1964: November 10,12, 13; 1965: April 9.\nPresent: Cartwright, Martland, Judson, Hall and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR MANITOBA\nMunicipal corporations\u2014Zoning by-law\u2014Failure to comply with Council's procedural resolution\u2014Action for declaration of invalidity of by-law\u2014Whether action barred by limitation period\u2014The Metropolitan Winnipeg Act, 1960 (Man.), c. 40, s. 206(4) [am. 1962, c. 97, s. 29(a)] (5) [en. 1962, c. 97, s. 29(b)].\nThe appellants were successful at trial in an action asking for a declaration that an amending zoning by-law passed by the respondent was invalid. The trial judgment was reversed on appeal, two members of the Court dissenting. The Metropolitan Council's procedural resolution for amendments to zoning by-laws required that notices of hearings be advertised in at least two newspapers and that notices be posted by the applicant for an amendment on the premises which were the subject-matter of the proposed amendment. The required notice was published in two newspapers but no notices were posted on the premises. A home owners association to which the appellants belonged and which was known by the respondent to be opposed to the application did not see the newspaper advertisements and had no notice or knowledge of the application.\nThe majority in the Court of Appeal held that even if the notice was defective for lack of posting, the most that could have been made of this omission was to find that the by-law was voidable only and not void, that under s. 206(5) of The Metropolitan Winnipeg Act, 1960 (Man.), c. 40, it had to be attacked within a three months' limitation period, and that, no such attack having been made, the by-law must stand. The trial judge and the dissenting judges in the Court of Appeal held that the by-law was void and could be attacked in an action for a declaration of invalidity even after the three months' limitation period had elapsed.\nHeld (Judson J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the judgment at trial restored.\nPer Cartwright and Spence JJ.: Subject to the reservation that it was not necessary to decide whether the attacked by-law was void, agreement was expressed with the reasons of Hall J. On the assumption that the by-law was merely voidable, the appellants' action was not barred by s. 206(5) of The Metropolitan Winnipeg Act. Re Gordon and De Laval Co. Ltd., [1938] O.R. 462, referred to.\nPer Martland and Hall JJ.: In enacting the amending zoning by-law the respondent was engaged in a quasi-judicial matter and was in law required to act fairly and impartially. It was obliged to act in good faith and fairly listen to both sides. St. John v. Fraser, [1935] S.C.R. 441; Board of Education v. Rice, [1911] A. C. 179; Re Howard and City of Toronto (1928), 61 O.L.R. 563, referred to.'\nIn the particular circumstances of this case the by-law was void. It was not merely the failure to post the placards but the manifest ignoring of the fact that the home owners association would oppose the by-law. A body with power to decide was obliged not to act until it had afforded the other party affected a proper opportunity to be heard. Ridge v. Baldwin, [1932] 2 AII E.R. 66, referred to.\nHowever, even if the by-law was voidable only, s. 206 of The Metropolitan Winnipeg Act would not bar the action for a declaratory judgment declaring the by-law invalid. The section appeared to provide a summary procedure to quash by-laws of the Metropolitan Council but it did not apply to an action such as this. There was nothing in the section depriving the appellants of their right to bring an action to have the by-law declared invalid. Wanderers Investment Co. v. City of Winnipeg, [1917] 2 W.W.R. 197, referred to.\nPer Judson J., dissenting: However one might characterize the form of activity in which the Metropolitan Council was engaged when it passed the amending by-law, it was a function which involved private rights in addition to those of the applicant and the municipality could not act without notice to those affected. But they gave clear, reasonable and adequate notice and the failure to direct the posting of notices pursuant to their own internal regulations, which were subject to their own control, did not affect the validity of their bylaw. This by-law was within the municipal function. The failure to post notices did not go to the question of jurisdiction nor was posting a condition precedent to the exercise of the statutory power. The by-law was validly enacted and was not open to any successful attack either by way of motion to quash or by way of action.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1], allowing an appeal from a judgment of Smith J. in which it was held that an amending zoning by-law of the Metropolitan Council of Greater Winnipeg was invalid. Appeal allowed, Judson J. dissenting.\nD. J. Jessiman, Q.C., and A. K. Twaddle, for the plaintiffs, appellants,\nD. C. Lennox and J. D. McNairnay, for the defendant, respondent. The judgment of Cartwright and Spence JJ. was delivered dy\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014In this appeal I agree with the conclusion of my brother Hall and subject to one reservation with his reasons.\nI do not find it necessary to decide whether the by-law which is attacked was void and propose to deal. with the appeal on the assumption that it was merely voidable. On that assumption, I agree with the reasons of my brother Hall for holding that, even if the by-law was voidable only, the appellants' action was not barred by s.206(5) of The Metropolitan Winnipeg Act, 1960 (Man.), c. 40.\nI wish to add a reference to the decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in Re Gordon and De Laval Co. Ltd[2]. in which Middleton J. A., with whose reasons all the other members of the Court agreed, said at p. 468:\nThe Municipal Act, R.S.O. 1937, ch. 266, provides machinery for summarily determining the validity or invalidity of municipal by-laws. This machinery had not been invoked within the time limited by the statute. This did not deprive the Supreme Court of its jurisdiction to set aside the by-law or to pronounce a declaratory decree concerning its validity \u2026\nIn my opinion this passage, whether or not it was strictly necessary to the decision, correctly states the law and is applicable to the circumstances of the case at bar.\nI would dispose of the appeal as proposed by my brother Hall.\nThe judgment of Martland and Hall JJ. was delivered by\nHALL J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[3] allowing the appeal of the respondent from the judgment of Smith J. of the Court of Queen's Bench in which he held that By-law No. 177 of the Metropolitan Corporation of Greater Winnipeg was invalid.\nOn April 13, 1962, the Council of the Metropolitan Corporation of Greater Winnipeg passed By-law No. 177 rezoning from \"Rl\" Single-Family District to \"R4A\" Multiple-Family District the following land:\nIn the City of Winnipeg, in the Province of Manitoba, being in accordance with the Special Survey of the said City and being Lots Forty to Forty-five, both inclusive, which lots are shown on a plan of survey of part of Lot Forty-five of the Parish of Saint Boniface registered in the Winnipeg Land Titles Office as No. 308, excepting out of said Lots Forty-four and Forty-five all that portion coloured pink on Plan 5262 taken for a road diversion by the City of Winnipeg.\nThis land is situate at the northwest corner of the intersection of Academy Road and Wellington Crescent and comprises approximately 3.4 acres. It is bounded on the north by the Assiniboine River, on the east by Academy Road and the approach to the Maryland Bridge, on the south by Wellington Crescent on which it fronts, and on the west by the easterly boundary of the Shrine Hospital property. The site is located immediately to the west of and adjacent to the south end of Maryland Bridge. Wellington Crescent up to Academy Road, and Academy Road itself, are both designated as major thoroughfares under the Draft Development Plan of the Metropolitan Corporation of Greater Winnipeg. Lots Forty-three, Forty-four and Forty-five comprising approximately 1.8 acres were at all times relevant to this action owned by the late Dr. B. J. Ginsburg. Lots Forty, Forty-one and Forty-two comprising the most westerly three lots of the area rezoned and forming an area of approximately 1.6 acres were at all times relevant to this action owned by Mr. Joseph Harris.\nThe appellants who are members of an unincorporated association known as the Crescentwood Home Owners Association brought action on their own behalf and on behalf of all other members of the Association to have said By-law No. 177 of the respondent declared invalid. The Crescentwood Home Owners Association is comprised of residents of the Crescentwood area in the City of Winnipeg which includes the tract covered by By-law No. 177. The overall objective of the Association has been to maintain the area in question as a single-family dwelling area. The Association had consistently opposed any attempts to have the area or any part of it rezoned or used for any purpose other than for single-family units.\nIn 1956 Dr. Ginsburg obtained two orders from the Zoning Board of the City of Winnipeg permitting him to erect on his property an 8-storey 64-suite apartment block. The granting of these orders was opposed by the Association which also unsuccessfully appealed both orders to the Municipal and Public Utility Board. The orders were for one year and were renewed from year to year ex parte and without notice to the Association and were in force and effect on April 1, 1961, when the Metropolitan Corporation of Great Winnipeg succeeded the City of Winnipeg in jurisdiction over zoning matters.\nOn November 22, 1961, Messrs. Johnston, Jessiman, Gardner & Johnston, as solicitors for the appellants, wrote the respondent as follows:\nThe Metropolitan Corporation of Greater Winnipeg,\n100 Main Street,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nAttention: Mr. John Pelletier\nDear Sirs:\nRe: City of Winnipeg Zoning Board Orders\nWe act on behalf of the Crescentwood Home Owners Association.\nAs you know, the City of Winnipeg Zoning Board granted one year extensions to many of the orders made by it just prior to all zoning functions being taken over by Metro in April, 1961. We are interested in what our client's position is in respect to two such orders, namely, Z46\/56 and Z113\/57. The particulars of these two orders are as follows:\n(1) Z46\/56\u2014on February 14th, 1956, the City of Winnipeg Zoning Board granted this order varying the Z. 1 restrictions applicable to the land commonly known as 3 Academy Road and 387 Wellington Crescent, being lot 43 and part of lots 44 and 45, D.G.S. 43\/45 St. Boniface, plan 308, to permit the construction and maintenance of an eight storey apartment building containing sixty-four suites and twelve maids' rooms. The said order stipulated that it would automatically expire one year from February 14th, 1956, unless satisfactory operations to construct the said apartment building were completed or an extension of time granted by the Board.\n(2) Z113\/57\u2014On April 23rd, 1957, the Board granted order No. Z113\/57 varying the R. 1 restrictions applicable to a triangular portion of land at the north-west corner of Wellington Crescent and Academy Road to permit the said land to be used in conjunction with adjoining land, being the land described in\nthe preceding paragraph, for the construction and maintenance of the said apartment building in accordance with plans filed with the Board. This order was likewise to expire within one year unless construction was commenced or an extension granted within that period.\nThe said orders have been extended by the Board from year to year. The last extension granted in respect to Z46\/56 expired on February 14th, 1962, while that granted in respect to Z113\/57 expires on April 23rd, 1962. On behalf of our client we opposed both applications which were granted by the Board on the dates as indicated and appealed both orders to the Municipal and Public Utility Board which were dismissed.\nOur understanding is that the Board extended its orders upon an ex parte application being made to it for renewal. Orders Nos. Z46\/56 and Z113\/57 have been renewed four and three times respectively, without any notice of such application for renewal being given to our client.\nSubsection 3 of section 82 of the Metropolitan Winnipeg Act appears to provide that the Metro Council has all the rights and powers possessed by the Winnipeg Zoning Board.\nIt would be much appreciated if you would send us a letter advising what policy the Metro Council is adopting towards applications to renew the validity of zoning orders of the Winnipeg Zoning Board such as Z46\/56 and Z113\/57. We submit that under the circumstances relating to these two orders, no further extension should be granted by the Council. If this policy were followed it would mean that unless satisfactory operations to construct the said apartment building have been completed before the last extensions granted by the Board expire then a new application to vary the R. 1 restrictions applying to the said land will have to be made to the Board of Adjustment. Such a policy would ensure that our client would have an opportunity to make representations against such an application if it felt it was in its interest to do so.\nIn the alternative, if the Council decides to entertain applications to renew such orders then we ask that notice be given to our client so that it will have the opportunity to be heard at the hearing of such an application.\nYours truly,\nJOHNSTON, JESSIMAN, GARDNER & JOHNSTON,\nPer: \"W. P. Riley\"\nWPR:dm\nOn or about December 22, 1961, Dr. Ginsburg applied to the Metropolitan Corporation of 'Greater Winnipeg to further extend these Zoning Board orders to April 30, 1963. The application was first heard by the Committee on Planning on January 4, 1962, at which time Mr. D. J. Jessiman, Q.C., representing the Association, opposed the granting of the proposed extension of time on the Zoning Board orders. The Planning Committee recommended that the orders be extended until April 30, 1963. The application with the recommendation of the Director of Planning was dealt with by the Metropolitan Council on January 11, 1962. Mr. Jessiman again appeared to oppose the granting of the extension of time being asked for. The Metropolitan Council overruled the objection and extended the time to April 30, 1963.\nMeanwhile, Dr. Ginsburg had requested the Metropolitan Corporation by letter dated December 27, 1961, to rezone his land from \"R1\" to \"R4A\". On January 29, 1962, the Director of Planning, after a meeting of the Technical Committee, composed of staff members of the Corporation, had considered the application, recommended to the Planning Committee that both the Ginsburg and Harris land be rezoned to an appropriate multiple-family dwelling category.\nAt its meeting of February 1, 1962, the Committee on Planning concurred in the recommendation of the Director and instructed the Director to proceed with the usual publication of a notice of public hearing. Subsequently, on March 1 and March 8, 1962, a notice appeared in the Winnipeg Free Press and the Winnipeg Tribune advising of the meeting to be held on March 12th.\nAt the Committee on Planning meeting on March 12th, no one appeared in opposition to the application for rezoning. The Committee recommended to Council that all six lots, i.e., the\nGinsburg and the Harris property, be rezoned to \"R4A\" classification, a multiple-family district. Council accepted the recommendation of the Planning Committee and subsequently By-law No. 177 was passed on April 13, 1962. In the meantime, Dr. Ginsburg had died.\nOn November 28, 1963, the appellants issued a statement of claim asking for a declaratory judgment to the effect that By-law No. 177 was invalid.\nOn December 18, 1963, the respondent issued a building permit to Welbridge Holdings Limited of Winnipeg who had taken over the Ginsburg interests to erect on the lands in question a 12-storey high-rise apartment block to contain 166 suites, the dimensions of the building being 166' * 198'9\". The appellants amended their statement of claim on January 20, 1964, claiming a declaration that the said building permit was invalid and should be cancelled.\nThe Crescentwood Home Owners had no notice or knowledge of Dr. Ginsburg's application to rezone from \"R1\" to \"R4A\".\nThe appellants contended (1) that the Association should have had notice of the application to rezone as aforesaid and, not having been notified or given an opportunity to oppose the application to rezone, By-law No. 177 was null and void; (2) that By-law No. 177 was not passed in good faith and in the public interest, but was, in fact, passed for Dr. Ginsburg's benefit only and was void.\nThe appellants rely on para. 10 of the Metropolitan Council's resolution which it adopted as the procedure to be followed in connection with applications to amend zoning by-laws and town planning schemes. Para. 10 of that resolution reads:\n10. Public notice shall be given by advertising in at least two newspapers having a general circulation in the Metropolitan Area each week for at least two weeks before the hearing. The Director of Planning shall notify the municipality in which the land is situated of the proposed amendment and the time and place when the Committee on Planning will consider the amendment. The Director of Planning shall give to the applicant notices to be posted by the applicant on the premises which are the subject of the proposed amendment. Such notices must be erected by the applicant not less than 14 days before the date set for the hearing and shall be in such form as the Director of Planning may from time to time prescribe \u2026.\nNotice of Dr. Ginsburg's application to rezone was published in two newspapers having a general circulation in the metropolitan area, the Winnipeg Tribune and the Winnipeg Free Press in the issues of March 1 and March 8, 1962. The size of the advertisements was criticized, but it must be accepted that the advertisements were in the type and format usually used for legal notices of various kinds. The notice in question dealt with four applications, two in the City of Winnipeg, one in the Rural Municipality of Assiniboia and one in the Rural Municipality of St. Vital. Insofar as it dealt with the area in question in this appeal, the notice read:\nTHE METROPOLITAN CORPORATION\nOF GREATER WINNIPEG\nZONING NOTICE\nTAKE NOTICE that the Planning Committee of the Metropolitan Corporation of Greater Winnipeg will hold a public hearing at 2:00 p.m., Monday, March 12, 1962, in the Council Chambers, 100 Main Street, for the purpose of considering a re-zoning of the following areas and permitting certain specific uses on particular properties:\n1. City of Winnipeg\n***\n(b) Northwest corner Wellington Crescent and Academy Road. From \"R1\" (One-family) District to \"R4A\" (Multiple-family) District property situated on the Northwest corner of Wellington Crescent and Academy Road more particularly described as Lots 40 to 45 inclusive, Plan 308, D.G.S. 45 Parish of St. Boniface except that portion of Lot 45 shown on Plan 5262 reserved for a road diversion by the City of Winnipeg. It is proposed to erect a multi-storey luxury apartment block on this property.\nHowever, the second requirement of para. 10 above as to notices to be posted by the applicant on the premises was not compiled with. No notices were posted on the premises. No reason for this omission or explanation therefor was given and it appears that the Metropolitan Council proceeded to deal with the application on the basis that the requirements of said para. 10 had been complied with.\nThe respondent took the position that in enacting By-law No. 177 it was engaged in a legislative function and not in a quasi-judicial act and that it had the right to proceed without notice to interested parties despite its own procedure resolution before mentioned. I agree with Freedman J. A. when, on this aspect of the matter, he says:\nBut to say that the enactment of By-law No. 177 was simply a legislative act is to ignore the realities and the substance of the case. For this was not a by-law of wide or general application, passed by the Metropolitan Council because of a conviction that an entire area had undergone a change in character and hence was in need of re-classification for zoning purposes. Rather this was a specific decision made upon a specific application concerned with a specific parcel of land. Metro had before it the application of Dr. Ginsburg, since deceased, for permission to erect a high-rise apartment building on the site in question. Under then existing zoning regulations such a building would not be lawful. To grant the application would require a variation in the zoning restrictions. Many residents of that area, as Metro well knew, were opposed to such a variation, claiming that it would adversely affect their own rights as property holders in the district. In proceeding to enact By-law No. 177 Metro was essentially dealing with a dispute between Dr. Ginsburg, who wanted the zoning requirements to be altered for his benefit, and those other residents of the district who wanted the zoning restrictions to continue as they were. That Metro resolved the dispute by the device of an amending by-law did indeed give to its proceedings an appearance of a legislative character. But in truth the process in which it was engaged was quasi-judicial in nature; and I feel I must so treat it.\nThen counsel argues as well that the governing statute does not call for notice. Hence, he says, notice was not required. I am unable to accept this contention. A long line of authorities, both old and recent, establish that in judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings notice is required unless the statute expressly dispenses with it. The mere silence of the statute is not enough to do away with notice. In such cases, as has been said, the justice of the common law will supply the omission of the legislature. Some of the authorities dealing with this subject are referred to by Kirby J. in the recent case of Camac Exploration Ltd. v. Oil and Gas Conservation Board of Alberta, (1964), 47 W.W.R. 81.\nThe fact is that the Association did not see the notice which was published in the Winnipeg Tribune and the Winnipeg Free Press on March 1 and 8, 1962. An explanation as to why the Association did not see the advertisement published in the Winnipeg Tribune and the Winnipeg Free Press is that Mr. S. Greene who was secretary of the Association at the relevant time and who died prior to the trial was out of Winnipeg on holidays at that period in March 1962. Metro could not, of course, be expected to know this. However, it was stated in evidence by Mr. Johnston who was president of the Association at the time in question that if the placards contemplated by para. 10 of the procedure resolution had been erected on the premises for the 14-day period before the date set for the hearing he would certainly have seen them. He testified further that if he or some other member of the Association had seen the placards the Association would have taken certain action to oppose the application on March 12th. It may be worth observing that on March 1, 1962, Metro notified Messrs. Keith & Westbury, solicitors for Dr. Ginsburg that the application to rezone the property would be considered by the Planning Committee of Metro at a public hearing to be held at 2:00 p.m., Monday, March 12, 1962, and the letter concluded with this paragraph: \"You or an accredited representative should attend this meeting in accordance with section 80 of the Metropolitan Winnipeg Act.\" No similar or any notice was sent to the Association and as it was no one from the Association appeared to oppose the application when it came before Metro Council on March 12, 1962. It is manifest that had the Association received notice of the hearing or had it been aware that the application was to be dealt with on March 12, 1962, it would have had counsel present to object to the rezoning. The Association had on January 11, 1962, opposed extending the Zoning Board orders which Dr. Ginsburg had obtained in 1956 and which had been renewed from year to year until 1961. Although Metro knew of the Association's pronounced interest in any rezoning of the property in question, it did not communicate with it when Dr. Ginsburg applied on December 27, 1961 to rezone from \"R1\" to \"R4A\", nor did Metro, when all the interested parties were before it, make any reference to that new application when on January 4, 1962, and on January 11, 1962, council for the Association opposed further extending the 1956 orders permitting Dr. Ginsburg to erect a 64-suite apartment building. Moreover, Metro, on January 23, 1962, wrote Messrs. Johnston, Jessiman, Gardner & Johnston as follows:\nMessrs. Johnston, Jessiman, Gardner & Johnston,\nBarristers,\n3rd Floor, Natural Gas Bldg.,\n265 Notre Dame Avenue,\nWINNIPEG 2, Manitoba.\nAtt: Mr. D. J. Jessiman.\nDear Sirs:\nPlease be advised that at its meeting held on January 11th, 1962, the Metropolitan Council granted an extension of Winnipeg Zoning Board Orders Z46\/56 and Z113\/57 in favour of Dr. B. J. Ginsburg, insofar as they affect No. 3 Academy Road and No. 587 Wellington Crescent, and more particularly described as Lot 43 and part of Lots 44 and 45, D.G.S. 43\/45, St. Boniface, Plan 308 to April 30th, 1963, the said orders allowing the applicant to construct a 64 suite apartment block in the above noted site.\nYours truly,\n\"D. C. Lennox\"\nD. C. Lennox,\nSecretary.\nRGP\/nm\nThis letter refers to the orders permitting a 64-suite apartment building without in any way referring to the new application to rezone and to erect a 12-storey 166-suite apartment building which was then actually under consideration. Metro was aware at this time that Dr. Ginsburg did not intend proceeding with the 8-storey 64-suite project.\nWhat are the legal consequences of the manner in which Dr. Ginsburg's application to rezone was dealt with by the respondent? The matter being, as I have stated, a quasijudicial one, Metro was in law required to act fairly and impartially: See St. John v. Fraser[4], at p. 452. In the language of Lord Loreburn in Board of Education v. Rice[5], at p. 182: \"\u2026 they must act in good faith and fairly listen to both sides, for that is a duty lying upon everyone who decides anything.\"\nThe obligation of a municipal body in carrying out its responsibilities is aptly and correctly stated by Masten J. A. in Re Howard and City of Toronto[6], at p. 576:\nIn dealing with a proposed by-law which involves a conflict of interests between private individuals who are affected, the council, while exercising a discretion vested in it by statute, acts in a quasi-judicial capacity \u2026 and its preliminary investigations and all subsequent proceedings ought to be conducted in a judicial manner, with fairness to all parties concerned.\nAnd, at p. 579:\nThe council is empowered in cases like this to adjudicate between conflicting interests.\nIn performing that duty councils are bound, like courts of justice, to see that every person interested is afforded full opportunity of presenting his views and contentions. The powers conferred on the council carry with them an obligation to see that every one affected gets British fair play, not only from the council itself when passing the by-law, but from its officers and committees in the preliminary steps leading up to the final result. Guy J.A., (Schultz J.A. concurring) after referring to these quotations, went on to say:\nThe evidence disclosed so much correspondence and discussion over such a lengthy period of time, that it is not open to the Metro Council to rely on the argument that this was a legislative by-law for the good of the community, in the public interest, in good faith, and initiated by Metro Council itself in an attempt to \"better the lot of\" the inhabitants of the Metropolitan area as a whole. In the light of all of the evidence, it is clear that the passage of this by-law was simply the end result of a plan conceived and carried forward by Dr. Ginsburg and his solicitors.\nThis in turn indicates that the by-law was passed in the interest of one person directly and would only indirectly benefit the Metropolitan area as a whole. This, of course, goes to the matter of public interest.\nThe fact that written notice, of a hearing of February 1, 1962 and March 12, 1962, was sent to Dr. Ginsburg's solicitors and not to the Home Owners, despite the fact that the opposing interests of the Home Owners were known to Metro, not only places Metro in an untenable position from the standpoint of equitable justice, but emphasizes the argument that the passage of this by-law was indeed to benefit one person and had little if any regard for the public interest as a whole.\nThe point to be decided is whether the failure to post the placards on the premises and proceeding to hold hearings on Dr. Ginsburg's application to rezone in the absence of the Association when Metro knew that the Association would oppose any such application and was actually opposing the extension applications at that very time, vitiated By-law No. 177 and rendered it a nullity.\nI am of opinion that the by-law was void in the particular circumstances of this case. It was not merely the failure to post the placards but the manifest ignoring of the fact known to it that the Association would oppose the by-law and that the Association had been advised by the letter of January 23, 1962 (Ex.1) that the orders of 1956 had been extended to April 30, 1963 for the 8-storey 64-suite apartment block, leaving the Association with no reason to believe or expect that the concurrent application to rezone was at that very time being processed without its knowledge.\nThe obligation on a body with the power to decide not to act until it has afforded the other party affected a proper opportunity to be heard is aptly stated by Lord Reid in Ridge v. Baldwin1[7], at p. 81 as follows:\nThen there was considerable argument whether in the result the watch committee's decision is void or merely voidable. Time and again in the cases I have cited it has been stated that a decision given without regard to the principles of natural justice is void and that was expressly decided in Wood v. Wood, (1874) L.R. 9 Exch. 190. I see no reason to doubt these authorities. The body with the power to decide cannot lawfully proceed to make a decision until it has afforded to the person affected a proper opportunity to state his case.\nHaving arrived at the conclusion that the by-law was void, there remains for determination the question whether the appellant's action was barred by the provisions of s. 206 of The Metropolitan Winnipeg Act, 1960 (Man.), c. 40, which reads as follows:\n206. (4) Any resident of the metropolitan area may apply to a judge of the Court of Queen's Bench in chambers to quash a by-law of the metropolitan council in the manner in which, and for the reasons for which, a by-law of a municipal council may be quashed under sections 390 to 391 and 393 to 395 of The Municipal Act and those sections and subsection (2) of section 290 of that Act apply, mutatis mutandis, to an application made under this subsection and in particular, substituting the expression \"metropolitan corporation\" for \"municipal corporation\" and \"secretary\" for \"clerk\".\n[am. 1962, c. 97, s. 29(a)]\n(5) No application under subsection (4) shall be entertained unless it is made within three months from the passing of the by-law. [enacted 1962, c. 97, s. 29(b)]\nThis section cannot be invoked as a bar to the action. The law in this regard is stated by Rogers in The Law of Canadian Municipal Corporations, vol. 2, p. 893, as follows:\n\u2026 if a by-law is within the power of the council and remains unimpeached within the time limited, it is validated by the effluxion of time.\nIt must be stressed, however, that the curative effect of a failure to quash a by-law is limited to by-laws which are merely voidable and not void. The courts have made a distinction between these two classes of illegal by-laws. A voidable by-law is one that is defective for non-observance or want of compliance with a statutory formality or an irregularity in the proceedings relating to its passing and is therefore liable to be quashed whereas a void by-law is one that is beyond the competence to enact either because of complete lack of power to legislate upon the subject matter or because of a non-compliance with a prerequisite to its passing.\nEven if the by-law was voidable only as argued by the respondent, I do not think that s. 206 of The Metropolitan Winnipeg Act, supra, would bar the action for a declaratory judgment declaring the by-law invalid. The section in question appears to provide a summary procedure to quash bylaws of the Metropolitan Council but it does not apply to an action such as this. There is nothing in the section depriving the appellants of their right to bring an action to have the by-law declared invalid: Wanderers Investment Co. v. The City of Winnipeg[8], at p. 205. In view of my finding that the by-law was void for want of notice and for failure to give the appellants an opportunity to oppose the application to rezone, I do not find it necessary to deal with the second ground that By-law No. 177 was not passed in good faith and in the public interest.\nI would accordingly allow the appeal and restore the judgment of Rhodes Smith J. with costs throughout.\nJUDSON J. (dissenting):\u2014In spite of the wide range of the argument on this appeal, the issue is very narrow. The trial judge quashed an amending zoning by-law for want of notice. This judgment was reversed on appeal, Guy and Schultz JJ. A., dissenting. The sole question is whether adequate notice was given. There is no statutory requirement that any notice be given. The requirements are to be found in the Metropolitan Council's own procedural resolution for amendments to zoning by-laws. Without setting out the section in full, it provides for advertising in at least two newspapers and by the posting of notices by the applicant for the amendment on the premises which are the subject-matter of the proposed amendment. The criticism of the newspaper advertising by counsel for the appellant is, in my opinion, without foundation. It was clear and prominent and should have come to the notice of the appellants. They left the task of perusing advertising to a paid official of their association. He was away at the time of the advertising and his office assistants failed to see it. It is not disputed that there was no posting of notices on the property and that there was no resolution of Council dispensing with this, as there could have been.\nThe majority in the Court of Appeal held that even if the notice was defective for lack of the posting, the most that could have been made of this omission was to find that the by-law was voidable only and not void, that it had to be attacked within a three months' limitation period, and that, no such attack having been made, the by-law must stand. The trial judge and the dissenting judges in the Court of Appeal held that the by-law was void and could be attacked in an action for a declaration of invalidity even after the three months' limitation period had elapsed. Both the trial judge and the majority in the Court of Appeal found that the by-law was passed in good faith and in the public interest.\nI do not think that it helps one towards a solution of this case to put a label on the form of activity in which the Metropolitan Council was engaged when it passed this amending by-law. Counsel for the municipality wants to call it legislative and from that he argues that they could act without notice. The majority of the judges prefer the term quasi-judicial. However one may characterize the function, it was one which involved private rights in addition to those of the applicant and I prefer to say that the municipality could not act without notice to those affected. But I think that they gave clear, reasonable and adequate notice and that failure to direct the posting of notices pursuant to their own internal regulations, which were subject to their own control, does not affect the validity of their by-law. This by-law was within the municipal function. The failure to post notices does not go to the question of jurisdiction nor is posting a condition precedent to the exercise of the statutory power. I think that this by-law was validly enacted and was not open to any successful attack either by way of motion to quash or by way of action.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs, JUDSON J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, appellants: Johnston, Jessiman, Gardner, Twaddle & Johnston, Winnipeg.\nSolicitor for the defendant, respondent: D.

The action was dismissed at trial. On appeal, the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and directed a new trial. In answers to questions submitted by the trial judge the jury held that the defendant K used excessive force but that the excessive force did not cause the plaintiff\u2019s injuries. In the judgment of the Court of Appeal the second answer was regarded as perverse. The Court of Appeal also held that the trial was defective in that the trial judge did not explain to the jury what \u201ccorroborated\u201d meant, or what was \u201cmaterial evidence\u201d, or the application of s.15 of the Ontario Evidence Act, R.S.O. 1960, c.125, to the evidence of the defendants.\nHeld (Cartwright J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the judgment at trial restored.\nPer Fauteux, Martland, Judson and Spence JJ.: By implication the jury in its answers found that there was no excessive force until K had brought the plaintiff within the second set of doors of the police station. Their answer that there was excessive force from that latter point to the sergeant\u2019s desk was one unsupported by the evidence.\nAs to the issue with respect to corroboration, it was true that the trial judge did not define \u201ccorroboration\u201d or, at any rate, did not give dictionary definitions for that word. He did, however, read to the jury s.15 of The Evidence Act and in his remarks there were references which dealt with the test of Hodgins J.A. in McGregor v. Curry, (1914), 31 O.L.R. 261, that the evidence tends to prove that the evidence relied on is true or probably true in some material particular. In addition, the trial judge gave to the jury specific examples of evidence which he deemed capable of corroboration if the jury believed such items of evidence and gave to them the probative effect which he suggested they were capable of having.\nPriestman v. Colangelo et al., [1959] S.C.R. 615, referred to.\nPer Cartwright J., dissenting: From the medical evidence read with the answers of the jury it appeared that the plaintiff\u2019s injury resulted from some or all of a series of acts of the defendant K some of which were tortious and some justified. In these circumstances, the trial judge should have told the jury that it was for the defendant to satisfy them that, on the balance of probabilities, the injury to the plaintiff was not caused or contributed to by those of the defendant\u2019s actions which were wrongful. The failure to give such direction was a sufficient ground for upholding the order of the Court of Appeal that there should be a new trial at all events as to the defendant K.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, allowing an appeal from a judgment of Fraser J. Appeal allowed and judgment at trial restored, Cartwright J. dissenting.\nJ.R. Barr, Q.C., and H.J. Daniel, for the defendants, appellants.\nJ.J. Robinette, Q.C., and A. Maloney, Q.C., for the plaintiff, respondent. CARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):\u2014 The facts out of which this action arises and the course of the proceedings in the Courts below are set out in the reasons of my Brother Spence.\nI have reached the conclusion that we ought not to interfere with the decision of the Court of Appeal in so far as it directs a new trial of the action against Kirkpatrick.\nI am unable to agree that we should set aside the answer made by the jury to question 4. It is only in unusual circumstances that a second appellate court will set aside a finding of fact made by a jury and adopted in the unanimous judgment of the first appellate court. It is not without significance that the suggestion that the finding should be set aside appears to have been made for the first time in the course of the opening argument of counsel for the appellants in this Court.\nThere is no difficulty in stating the rule by which the Court should be guided. It is succinctly stated by Duff C.J. giving the unanimous judgment of the Court in McCannell v. McLean[1], at p. 343:\nThe principle has been laid down in many judgments of this Court to this effect, that the verdict of a jury will not be set aside as against the weight of evidence unless it is so plainly unreasonable and unjust as to satisfy the Court that no jury reviewing the evidence as a whole and acting judicially could have reached it. That is the principle on which this Court has acted for at least thirty years to my personal knowledge and it has been stated with varying terminology in judgments reported and unreported.\nLater in the judgment, at p. 345, Duff C.J. points out that the application of the rule to the facts of a particular case will often involve \u201ca question of not a little nicety\u201d and concludes the passage with the observation: \u201cit belongs, moreover, to a class of questions in the determination of which judges will naturally differ, and, as everyone knows, such differences of opinion do frequently appear.\u201d\nNothing would be gained by my reviewing in detail the evidence bearing on the matters raised in question 4. It appears to me that it would have justified the jury in find- ing that the transition from reasonably necessary force to force that was unreasonable occurred at a point in time somewhat earlier than that at which their answer fixed it. Their finding that it was reasonable up to a certain point is no more sacrosanct than their finding that it was unreasonable thereafter.\nIf the answer to question 4 stands, as in my opinion it should, it is obvious that the respondent would be entitled to, at least, nominal damages against Kirkpatrick and to this extent the judgment given at the trial would be erroneous. However, this alone would not justify the granting of a new trial; the proper course would be for this Court to fix the amount of damages and consider what order as to costs would be appropriate.\nA more serious question arises in regard to the answer given by the jury to question 5(a), that the excessive force did not cause the blood clot which accounts for the plaintiff\u2019s present condition.\nThe plaintiff\u2019s action was framed as one for damages for assault. The defence pleaded was a denial of the assault and a plea that the defendant Kirkpatrick arrested the plaintiff, that he had reasonable grounds to believe that the plaintiff was guilty of an offence, that the plaintiff endeavoured to escape and that Kirkpatrick used no more force than was necessary to effect the arrest and prevent the plaintiff\u2019s escape.\nIt was established in evidence that during the period of a few minutes between the time when Kirkpatrick placed the plaintiff under arrest and the time when the latter collapsed in the police station Kirkpatrick, on several occasions, applied such force to the person of the plaintiff as would constitute an assault unless it was justified.\nThe medical evidence taken as a whole leads to the irresistible inference that it was what occurred in that period of a few minutes which directly caused the plaintiff\u2019s injury.\nThe result of this medical evidence read with the answers of the jury is that the plaintiff\u2019s injury was caused by a closely connected series of acts of force exerted by Kirkpatrick some of which were justified and some of which were not. It may well be that the learned trial judge was not called upon to anticipate this result but when it appeared from the answers of the jury it was, in my opinion, essential that he should have directed the jury to re-consider their answer to question 5(a) and given them a further direction as to the incidence of the burden of proof.\nUp to this point the learned trial judge had instructed the jury that the onus was on the plaintiff to establish not only that one or more of the defendants assaulted him but also that the assault was the cause of his injury. No doubt this was a correct direction as to where the burden lay on the state of the pleadings. The question is, however, what was the necessary direction when it appeared that the plaintiff\u2019s injury resulted from some or all of a series of acts of the defendant Kirkpatrick some of which were tortious and some justified. After a consideration of the arguments of counsel and of the authorities on which they relied I have reached the conclusion that the learned trial judge should have told the jury that in these circumstances it was for the defendant to satisfy them that, on the balance of probabilities, the injury to the plaintiff was not caused or contributed to by those of the defendant\u2019s actions which were wrongful.\nI do not think this is an undue extension of the principle on which Cook v. Lewis[2] was decided. To adapt the words of Rand J., at p. 832, to the facts of this case, Kirkpatrick by commingling wrongful acts with justifiable conduct has, in effect, destroyed the victim\u2019s power of proof.\nIt is not for us to weigh the evidence, but, in my opinion, the medical evidence taken as a whole would have warranted the jury in finding that the violence inflicted on the plaintiff which was nearest in point of time to his collapse, and which they have found to be wrongful, was a contributing cause of that collapse. On this vital issue the plaintiff was entitled to the verdict of a properly instructed jury. The failure to give the direction which I have indicated should have been given is, in my opinion, a sufficient ground for upholding the order of the Court of Appeal that there should be a new trial at all events as to the defendant Kirkpatrick and I would dismiss his appeal.\nIf my view had been shared by the other members of the Court it would have been necessary to consider whether the appeal should be allowed as to Dawson and Fraser and what order should be made as to costs, but as the decision of the majority is that the appeal of all three defendants succeeds I do not pursue these questions.\nThe judgment of Fauteux, Martland, Judson and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nSPENCE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario pronounced on June 6, 1963, which allowed an appeal from the judgment of Fraser J. at trial, pronounced on February 8, 1962, upon the jury\u2019s answers to questions as set out hereunder.\nThe learned trial judge dismissed the action and the Court of Appeal directed a new trial.\nThe action was one for damages for injuries received by the plaintiff on July 29, 1960, when the defendants Kirkpatrick and Fraser, constables on the St. Catharines police force, acting on instructions of the defendant Dawson, the sergeant thereof, arrested the plaintiff and brought him in to the police station at St. Catharines.\nThe learned judge, in his charge to the jury, submitted to the jury certain questions, those questions and the jury\u2019s answers thereto are as follows:\n1. At the time of the plaintiff\u2019s arrest:\n(a) Was there a smell of alcohol on his breath? Answer: \u201cYes\u201d.\n(b) Did he admit he had been drinking? Answer: \u201cYes\u201d.\n(c) Was his speech thick? Answer: \u201cYes\u201d.\n(d) Did he have difficulty in getting his driver\u2019s licence from his wallet? Answer: \u201cYes\u201d.\n(e) Were his eyes glassy or bloodshot? Answer: \u201cYes\u201d.\n(f) Was he unsteady on his feet? Answer: \u201cYes\u201d.\n2. At the time of the arrest were the facts such as to create a reasonable suspicion in the mind of a reasonable man that Lament had the care and control of his automobile while his ability was impaired? Answer: \u201cYes\u201d. 3. Did the defendants, or any of them, use more force than was necessary to effect an arrest and keep the plaintiff in custody? Answer: \u201cYes\u201d.\n4. If your answer to question 3 is \u201cyes\u201d, of what did such excessive force consist? Give full particulars of when, where and by whom such force was used. Answer: \u201cThe excessive force consisted of the continued headlock, from when they (Kirkpatrick & Lament) entered the second set of doors to the counter, after they entered the main lobby. (By whom)\u2014By Constable Kirkpatrick.\u201d\n5. (a) If your answer to question 3 is \u201cyes\u201d, did the excessive force cause the blood clot which accounts for the plaintiff\u2019s present condition? Answer: \u201cNo\u201d.\n(b) If your answer to question 5(a) is \u201cyes\u201d, by what defendant or defendants was such force used? Not answered.\n(c) If your answer to question 3 is \u201cyes\u201d and your answer to question 5(a) is \u201cyes\u201d, which act or acts of excessive force caused the blood clot in the plaintiff\u2019s brain? Not answered.\n6. Regardless of your answer to any of the preceding questions, at what amount do you assess the plaintiff\u2019s damages resulting from the blood clot in the plaintiff\u2019s brain which formed on July 29th, 1960?\n\u201cOut-of-pocket\n$ 7,529.79\nDerived from Ford employment until now\n4,003.50\nFuture income at 2,000 per year for 28 years expectancy\n56,000.00\n25 years of incapacity and care\n32,500.00.\u201d\n7. If your answer to question 3 is \u201cyes\u201d, at what amount do you assess the plaintiff\u2019s damages, excluding all damages resulting from the blood clot which formed in the plaintiff\u2019s brain. And the answer to that is\u2014appears to be nil, in brackets.\nUpon the presentation of the appeal in this Court, many issues were argued very ably by counsel for the appellants and the respondents. I am of the opinion, however, that the appeal may be disposed of by considering only a very few issues.\nIn the judgment of the Court of Appeal, the jury\u2019s answer to question 5(a), supra, was regarded as perverse, as it will be seen that that is an answer which held that the excessive force found by the jury in their answer to question 4, did not cause the plaintiff\u2019s injuries. Upon the argument here, counsel for the appellants (defendants) took the position that there was no evidence upon which the jury could come to their answer to question 4. After careful consideration, I have come to the conclusion that I agree with that contention. There was evidence and, as I shall show hereafter, evidence sufficiently corroborated to support the jury\u2019s answers to questions 1 and 2. The jury\u2019s answer to question 4, supra, implies a holding that no excessive force was used until the defendant Kirkpatrick and the plaintiff entered the second set of doors in the police station. In the evidence it is recounted that the plaintiff, when apparently impaired and in the control of an automobile vehicle, first resisted arrest on Church Street in St. Catharines, and then at the corner of Church and James Streets in that city attempted to leap from the moving police car, requiring the defendant Kirkpatrick to grasp him firmly by the right arm and then pull him pack into the automobile by the use of a headlock. Constable Fraser arrived to assist only by lifting the plaintiff\u2019s feet back into the car. The evidence further shows that the plaintiff, upon Constable Kirkpatrick stopping at the police station and leaving the car by the left door to walk around the back of the car, opened the right hand door and attempted to escape. He was again grasped by Constable Kirkpatrick who again put a headlock on the plaintiff and forced him to enter, still held by a headlock, through the front door of the police station, along a short corridor and through the second door into the main front office of the police station. During the whole of this, the plaintiff was still held in a headlock.\nFrom the first or outer doorway to the police station, a 4-foot corridor led 5 feet 6 inches to a second set of doors then a space of 21 feet intervened between the second set of doors and the sergeant\u2019s desk surrounded by a counter which stood in the lobby of the police station.\nOn this warm, summer evening both sets of doors stood open. There is no evidence that Constable Kirkpatrick knew how far behind him was Constable Fraser who followed in the plaintiff\u2019s car. The plaintiff had twice tried to escape and there is not the slightest reason why Kirkpatrick should not have thought that if he should have loosened his grip on the plaintiff as he crossed the room the plaintiff would not again try to escape. If the force applied outside the police station was not excessive, and the jury have found it was not in their answers, then the application of the same force up to the moment Kirkpatrick let the plaintiff go and he stood up was no more excessive.\nThere is, therefore, no evidence of any change in the circumstances which would make the application of exactly the same degree of force during the few seconds it took to traverse the space between the second set of doors and the sergeant\u2019s desk excessive I am, therefore, of the opinion that the jury having found that there was no excessive force until the passing through that second set of doors by the plaintiff and the defendant Kirkpatrick their answer that there was excessive force from that latter point to the sergeant\u2019s desk is one unsupported by the evidence. It must be remembered that in deciding whether, in any particular case, a police officer had used more force than it is reasonably necessary to prevent an escape by flight within the meaning of s. 25 of the Criminal Code, general statements as to the duty to take care to avoid injuries to others derived from negligence cases must be accepted with reservation and only upon giving full weight to the fact that the act complained of is one done under statutory powers and in pursuance of a statutory duty: Locke J. in Priestman v. Colangelo et al.[3], at p. 622. Cartwright and Martland JJ. dissented in view of the fact that the persons injured were not the persons whom the police sought to apprehend, a circumstance not applicable to the present case.\nMcLennan J.A., in giving reasons in the Court of Appeal, held that the trial was defective in that the learned trial judge did not explain to the jury what \u201ccorroborated\u201d meant, or what was \u201cmaterial evidence\u201d, or the application of the section to the evidence of the defendants. The corroboration referred to is required by s. 15 of the Ontario Evidence Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 125, which reads as follows:\nIn an action by or against a mentally incompetent person so found, or a patient in a mental hospital, or a person who from unsoundness of mind is incapable of giving evidence, an opposite or interested party shall not obtain a verdict, judgment or decision on his own evidence, unless such evidence is corroborated by some other material evidence. The learned trial judge, at the commencement of the trial, had found as a fact that the plaintiff was a mentally incompetent person. Requirement of corroboration in a court action was considered by this Court in Smallman v. Moore[4]. There, the Court considered the corroboration required by what are now ss. 13 and 14 of the Ontario Evidence Act, i.e., the section applicable to actions by or against the heirs, next-of-kin, executors, administrators or assigns, of a deceased person. In the latter case, the relevant provision reads:\n\u2026an opposite or interested party shall not obtain a verdict, judgment or decision on his own evidence in respect of any matter occurring before the death of the deceased person, unless such evidence is corroborated by some other material evidence.\nIt will, therefore, be seen that the two sections, 14 and 15, are in para materia.\nKellock J. gave a judgment dissenting for other reasons but on the issue of corroboration his judgment was adopted by the majority. In the course of that judgment, he quoted from various authorities including McGregor v. Curry[5], where Hodgins J.A. said:\nAs the statute has been construed in the cases upon the subject, corroborative evidence is not required as to every fact necessary to enable the opposite party to recover. It is enough if sufficient relevant facts and circumstances appear, which tend to prove that the evidence relied on for recovery is true, or probably true, in some material particular. But the respondent\u2019s whole testimony, both in proof of his claim and in disproof of the defence, is the evidence upon which he recovers. Applying the cases referred to, if any part of that whole evidence is corroborated the statute is satisfied. This appears to follow as a proper conclusion.\nAnd stated the principle as follows, at p. 301:\nHowever that may be, the section here does not say that every fact necessary to be proved to establish a cause of action must be corroborated by evidence other than that of the interested party but that the evidence of the interested party itself is to be corroborated by some other material evidence. I do not think that the word \u201cmatter\u201d in the section is to be taken as synonymous with every fact required to be proved in establishing a cause of action and it has never, as far as I am aware, been so construed. Applying that standard to the corroboration required by the statute, I must, with respect, differ with the learned judge in the Court of Appeal. It is true that the learned trial judge did not define \u201ccorroboration\u201d or, at any rate, did not give dictionary definitions for that word. He did, however, read to the jury the section of the statute and said:\nSpeaking particularly and not technically, it must be some evidence corroborating the defendants\u2019 testimony on some material point, and one of the defendants in this case, as there are three parties to the action, the evidence of each requires corroboration, and one of them cannot corroborate the evidence of the other or others.\nAnd further:\n\u2026you may, if you see fit, regard that as some corroboration of the\u2026making the defendant\u2019s story seem more probable\u2026\nAnd further:\n\u2026as a corroborative fact or circumstance bearing on the probability or otherwise of the defendant Kirkpatrick\u2019s evidence being true.\n(The italicizing is my own.)\nIt will be seen that although those references do not include an exact definition of \u201ccorroboration\u201d, they do deal with the test of Hodgins J.A. that the evidence tends to prove that the evidence relied on is true or probably true in some material particular.\nIn addition, the learned trial judge gave to the jury five specific examples of evidence which he deemed capable of corroboration if the jury believed such items of evidence and gave to them the probative effect which he suggested they were capable of having. Counsel for the respondent here took the position that some of those items of evidence could not, in law, be corroboration. The first group of items of evidence given by the learned trial judge, that by the witnesses indicating that the plaintiff had some alcoholic beverages in the day, counsel objects to on the ground that it was completely equivocal in relation to the issue of whether there was reasonable and probable cause for the arrest. I do not find it equivocal. It is one of the factors which bear on the reasonableness of the belief of the defendant Kirkpatrick that the plaintiff should have been placed under arrest, and in addition it supplies an element of probability that the plaintiff should have engaged in such foolish attempts to escape from custody as his attempt to leap from the moving car and to escape from Constable Kirkpatrick outside the police station.\nThe third piece of evidence cited by the learned trial judge as possible corroboration was the bruise on the upper arm of the plaintiff. This was suggested as corroborating the evidence of the defendant Kirkpatrick that he had grasped that arm as the plaintiff attempted to leap from the moving police cruiser. The objection is that there is no evidence as to whether the plaintiff\u2019s arm had been bruised previously.\nMiss Orshinsky described the bruises which she observed when the plaintiff was brought into the hospital as follows:\nFrom its appearance, there were 4 small bruises fairly close together, on the inner aspect. On the inner aspect of his left arm above the elbow.\nQ. And would those bruises be consistent with a man reaching out and grabbing his left upper arm with his right hand? A. Very consistent.\nThose marks, in my view, are so typical of the injury which would have been caused by the grabbing as testified to by the defendant Kirkpatrick that the objection goes more to the weight of the evidence than to the admissibility thereof.\nThe fifth group of items of corroboration which counsel for the respondent objected to as being inadmissible was the evidence of one Lyle Staff as to the very short time that lapsed between the time he saw the police cruiser on James street and the time he went into the police station. This evidence was adduced by the defendants in a denial of an alleged assault which had occurred subsequent to the plaintiff having fallen to the floor in the police station. For the reason which I shall outline hereafter, it is quite irrelevant to the issues in the present appeal.\nCounsel for the respondent submitted that inadmissible evidence was permitted at the trial and that such inadmissible evidence went strongly to corroborate the evidence of the police officers and to contradict the evidence of four employees of the post office who swore that they had observed some of the events when standing in an open window some 100 to 150 feet away from the police station. No ruling was made on this subject in the Court of Appeal although McLennan J.A. said:\nA perusal of much of the evidence clearly indicates either ill-advised attempts to introduce inadmissible evidence or captious subjections to admissible evidence.\nThe evidence to which particular objection may be made may be summarized as follows. The various employees swore that they witnessed a police officer throw the plaintiff down on the floor of the police station so forcefully that at the very considerable distance away from the scene at which they stood they could hear and hear plainly the thud of the plaintiff\u2019s head on the floor. However, neither the admitting nurse, who saw the plaintiff when he arrived at the hospital, nor Dr. Dolan, the neurosurgeon who examined the plaintiff very carefully before operating on July 31st, found any trace of bump or bruises on the plaintiff\u2019s scalp. The defendants introduced as further evidence to contradict the evidence of the postal employees, inter alia, the evidence given by a Sgt. Gayder that he had caused another officer to stand in that same open window in the post office with his back to the window and then he, Gayder, had struck the floor of the police station with a hammer with blows of increasing force and yet it was only on the 15th and 16th blows that the listening officer indicated he could hear any sound, and that those blows had then become so forceful that he, Gayder, feared that he would break the floor. There is much, of course, to be said against that kind of evidence. It is absolutely impossible to duplicate all the elements affecting audibility on the night in question. But it would seem that that objection goes more to the weight of the evidence than to the admissibility and the learned trial judge, in his charge, said:\nNow, in connection with that incident, you have had some evidence of demonstration with the hammer performed by two of the\u2014or test, rather, made by the police as to whether the sound could be heard across the street. It was admitted, but I suggest to you\u2014that evidence was permitted, but I suggest to you that you should scrutinize quite carefully any evidence of that kind made by interested parties, without independent control, and a matter such as the loudness of a sound, or the amount of strength used, or the strength of a smell, are all things which are difficult to measure, and to define with any exactness, and you have the evidence before you of that, for what it is worth but you should scrutinize it very closely for that reason.\nI am of the opinion that there is a more convincing answer to this objection. That evidence went to contradict the evidence of the postal employees as to hearing the thud of the plaintiff\u2019s head when they alleged he was thrown to the floor. On all of the evidence, the plaintiff suffered his injuries when he stood erect in front of the sergeant\u2019s desk after Constable Kirkpatrick had released his headlock and then the plaintiff\u2019s eyes rolled and he slumped down. This all occurred prior to the alleged throwing of the plaintiff to the floor and, therefore, this evidence was quite irrelevant upon the issue of whether alleged excessive force caused the injury. It was said that these postal employees had also witnessed the events which occurred outside the police station before the headlock was put on the plaintiff by Constable Kirkpatrick. I have reviewed the evidence in extenso and quote resumes of those witnesses\u2019 evidence given in the respondent\u2019s factum:\nWilliam Fyfe\u2014heard tires squealing down the street, heard Lament say \u201cLet me go\u2014I will go in by myself\u201d. Kirkpatrick had Lament in headlock. Kirkpatrick and Lament were going in through the door of the police station and Kirkpatrick took Lament and threw him to the counter of the police station.\nJames Andrews\u2014they heard a man shout and holler. They ran to the window and saw Kirkpatrick bringing Lament in with a headlock around his neck.\nEdward Makse\u2014. they looked out the window and saw Kirkpatrick take Lament in with a headlock. He was about the front steps of the police station by then.\nHarry Stevens\u2014he saw Kirkpatrick holding Lament in a secure headlock. Lament appeared to be complaining about the headlock. He did not see Lament resist Kirkpatrick. Therefore, not one of these four persons saw the alleged attempt to escape by Lament outside the police station. Their observations all commenced after that, and therefore, their evidence cannot contradict the evidence of Kirkpatrick on the subject of the alleged escape and the contradiction of their evidence by the alleged inadmissible evidence in reference to the hammer test is irrelevant.\nHaving come to the conclusion that it was not open to the jury upon the evidence to answer questions 3 and 4 in the fashion which they did answer when they must have concluded that no excessive force was used up to the time the defendant Kirkpatrick brought the plaintiff within the second set of doors, then I am of the opinion that the action should have been dismissed as the trial judge did dismiss it.\nTherefore, I would allow the appeal with costs both here and in the Court of Appeal, and restore the judgment at trial.\nAppeal allowed, judgment at trial restored with costs, CARTWRIGHT J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the defendants, appellants: Fleming, Harris, Kerwin, Barr & Hildebrand, St. Catharines.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: Moloney & Hess, Toronto.\n[1] [1937] S.C.R. 341.\n[2] [1951] S.C.R. 830.\n[3] [1959] S.C.R. 615.\n[4] [1948] S.C.R. 295.\n[5] (1914), 31 O.L.R. 261.\n",

The medical evidence attributed the death to a blow or blows on the head. The only direct evidence to connect the appellant with the death consisted of an alleged confession made by her to her friend S, and of three statements she is alleged to have made to her friend K. During the three and a half years between the death and the trial, S gave several statements to the police and gave evidence under oath at the inquest, but each of her accounts differed as to her own activities on the night of the murder. It was not until three years after the night in question that she first told the police about the alleged confession. The accused was said to have been intoxicated when she made these statements. The Court of Appeal affirmed the conviction. The accused appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Abbott J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and a new trial directed on the charge of manslaughter.\nPer Cartwright, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ.: The trial judge said enough to indicate that in weighing the evidence of K and S the jury should give serious consideration to the inconsistencies in the statements made by S and to the failure of both women to come forward with their stories at an earlier date. The theory of the defence that these two witnesses were unworthy of belief was expressed by the trial judge with sufficient clarity to comply with the authorities. Deacon v. R. [1947] S.C.R. 531.\nThere was however a total absence of any direction on the question of whether, if the appellant did make the incriminating statements attributed to her by the two women, those statements were in fact true. The evidence of the appellant's intoxication was such as to make it desirable for the trial judge to tell the jury that it was a factor to be taken into consideration in assessing the value of her confession and statements as evidence against her. Assuming that the inconsistencies between the alleged confession and the autopsy as to how the victim met her death was not raised by way of defence, and notwithstanding the fact that defence counsel did not object to the trial judge's failure to comment on it, the charge to the jury should nevertheless have contained specific direction to the effect that the truth of the appellant's alleged admission was to be considered in light of this discrepancy and in light also of her intoxication at the time when the admission was alleged to have been made.\nPer Abbott J., dissenting: The objections to the trial judge's charge made by the appellant did not, as found by the Court of Appeal, constitute sufficient grounds to allow the appeal.

La seule preuve directe contre l'appelante comprenait un pr\u00e9tendu aveu qu'elle aurait fait \u00e0 son amie S, et trois d\u00e9clarations qu'elle est suppos\u00e9e avoir faites \u00e0 son amie K. Durant les trois ann\u00e9es et demie entre le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de la victime et le proc\u00e8s, S fit plusieurs d\u00e9clarations \u00e0 la police et t\u00e9moigna sous serment \u00e0 l'enqu\u00eate du coroner, mais chacun de ses r\u00e9cits diff\u00e9rait quant \u00e0 ses propres activit\u00e9s la nuit du meurtre. Ce n'est que trois ans apr\u00e8s la nuit en question qu'elle fit part \u00e0 la police pour la premi\u00e8re fois du pr\u00e9tendu aveu.

Deacon v. R. [1947] R.C.S. 531.\nIl y a eu cependant une absence totale de directive sur la question de savoir si, admettant que l'appelante ait fait les d\u00e9clarations qui lui \u00e9taient imput\u00e9es par les deux femmes, ces d\u00e9clarations \u00e9taient en fait vraies. La preuve se rapportant \u00e0 l'intoxication de l'appelante \u00e9tait telle qu'il \u00e9tait d\u00e9sirable que le juge au proc\u00e8s avertisse le jury que c'\u00e9tait un facteur qui devait \u00eatre pris en consid\u00e9ration dans l'\u00e9valuation de la valeur comme preuve contre elle de sa confession et de ses d\u00e9clarations. En prenant pour acquis que les variances entre le pr\u00e9tendu aveu et le r\u00e9sultat de l'autopsie d\u00e9montrant comment la victime avait succomb\u00e9 n'avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9es comme moyen de d\u00e9fense, et malgr\u00e9 le fait que l'avocat de la d\u00e9fense ne s'\u00e9tait pas object\u00e9 au d\u00e9faut du juge de commenter ce point, l'adresse du juge au jury aurait d\u00fb quand m\u00eame contenir une d\u00e9claration sp\u00e9cifique \u00e0 l'effet que la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 de la pr\u00e9tendue admission faite par l'appelante devait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e en regard de cette variance et aussi en regard de son intoxication au temps o\u00f9 cet aveu \u00e9tait suppos\u00e9 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 fait.\nLe juge Abbott, dissident: Les griefs contre l'adresse du juge au proc\u00e8s soulev\u00e9s par l'appelante ne constituaient pas, tel que la Cour d'Appel l'a d\u00e9clar\u00e9, des motifs suffisants pour maintenir l'appel.\nAPPEL d'un jugement de la Cour d'Appel de la Colombie-Britannique[1], confirmant un verdict de culpabilit\u00e9 pour homicide involontaire coupable. Appel maintenu et nouveau proc\u00e8s ordonn\u00e9, le juge Abbott \u00e9tant dissident. APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[2], affirming the conviction of the appellant for manslaughter. Appeal allowed and new trial directed, Abbott J. dissenting.\nH. A. D. Oliver, for the appellant.\nW. G. Burke-Robertson, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Cartwright, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014This is an appeal brought with leave of this Court from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[3] by which that Court dismissed the appellant's appeal from her conviction for manslaughter on an indictment charging her with the non-capital murder of her mother-in-law, Mrs. Thrine Rustad on June 10, 1960.\nIt is apparent that the appellant was on very bad terms with her 80-year old mother-in-law who was her next door neighbour and who was found lying dead on the floor of her own house on June 10, 1960, and it is also clear that the old lady had come to a violent end which the medical evidence attributed to a blow or blows on the head, but the only direct evidence to connect the appellant with the death consisted of a confession which she is alleged to have made to her one-time friend, Mrs. Shannon. The prosecution contends that this confession finds some support in the story told by a young girl named Koronko of three statements made to her by the appellant and it is contended also that the evidence of fingerprints found on the back door by police sergeant Davies is consistent with the appellant having broken into her mother-in-law's house on the night of 9th-10th of June.\nAt the trial the appellant's counsel based the defence in large measure on the contention that the evidence of Mrs. Shannon and Miss Koronko was not worthy of belief and that without that evidence there was no case for the Crown.\nMrs. Shannon had spent the evening of the 9th of June at the appellant's house where she had dinner and where she and the appellant had a number of drinks together. She did not leave the house until the early hours of the morning of the 10th of June and on the following day made a statement to the police which reads, in part, as follows:\nShortly after at about 9:30 p.m. Mr. Rustad packed some of his things and left the house. I didn't see him going in his car as I wasn't paying attention. During this time a policeman came and spoke to Mrs. Rustad. At this time I was feeling quite sleepy as a result of my drink and lied on the couch in the living room and fell asleep. When I woke up it was about 3:00 a.m., and I saw Mrs. Rustad walking around \u2026 She was ranting and raving about something but I don't know what. At this time Mrs. Rustad was drinking rye and was very excited and drunk. I then got up and made her a cup of tea. While she was drinking her tea I washed the dishes. Shortly thereafter Mrs. Rustad went to bed and she fell asleep right away.\nIn the course of the more than three and a half years which elapsed between the death and the trial, Mrs. Shannon made three additional statements to the police and gave evidence under oath at the inquest, but each of the accounts which she gave differed as to her own activities on the night in question and it was not until August 24, 1963, that she first told the police about a confession saying:\nWhen I awoke on the couch Olive Rustad was standing in the middle of the living room and she came over to me and it was then she said: 'I killed the old lady'.\nAt the trial Mrs. Shannon described the conversation which she had with the appellant after she woke up in the following terms:\nWell, she came in and then she told me that she had been over to Mrs. Rustad \u2026And she had words with her and then she said that she had killed her, and I said, 'Oh' or something like that. And then I said, 'Oh, no. You didn't'. And then she said that she had killed her with her own panties.\nQ. With what?\nA. Her own underwear.\nQ. Her own panties; that is, underwear. Yes?\nA. Oh, she said, 'You wouldn't like to have a murderess for a friend,' She said that to me. So I got sick and I left\u2014and I went out, right out the back door. It was a warm night and the doors were open so I went right out to the fence and I got sick over the fence.\nMiss Koronko, who was 20 years old at the date of the trial, recounted three isolated conversations which she had had with the appellant. The first was in July 1960 when they were alone together and Mrs. Rustad brought up the subject of her mother-in-law's death saying \"that she hated the old lady but she could never kill her.\" Although Miss Koronko went to live with the appellant in the same house in May 1961, she does not appear to recall any other references to the matter until one night in December 1961, at about midnight when she says that the appellant had been drinking and was \"tight\" and while \"tight\", was discussing her mother-in-law and then she began to cry very badly and she had her head down on her arms, on the table, and she said, \"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do it. I didn't mean to go that far.\"\nThe only other statement having any bearing on the matter to which Miss Koronko testified was allegedly made in February 1962 on an occasion when her boy friend, Len Soloway, was in the house and was talking about the trouble that his sister had with her mother-in-law. Miss Koronko says that the appellant at that time said \"that she knew that mothers-in-law caused a lot of trouble and that Bernice, Len's sister, should do something about it before it was too late because Mrs. Rustad knew what it was like and she had to do something about hers\". It is noteworthy that Soloway, who gave evidence, stated of this conversation, \"I never thought it meant anything at that time\".\nMiss Koronko went on living with the appellant until November 1962 but does not appear to have made any mention of these conversations to anyone in authority until May 1963.\nThe first ground upon which leave to appeal to this Court was granted complained of the failure of the trial judge \"to instruct the jury that it was dangerous and unsafe to put much reliance upon the evidence of Mrs. Shannon because of her numerous prior inconsistent statements both verbal and in writing and one prior statement that she testified to under oath\".\nI do not think that the differences in detail between the various accounts given by Mrs. Shannon of her own activities on June 9 justify the accusation of perjury which was so strongly urged against her by appellant's counsel, but if she was telling the truth at the trial about the appellant having confessed to the killing on the morning of the death, it is singular to say the least of it that when giving evidence at the inquiry into the same death only fifteen days after the alleged confession was made, she did not mention it at all and could only explain her failure to do so by saying, \"I always felt that you could not tell about a murder or a killing unless you were an eye witness\". This was undoubtedly a circumstance bearing directly upon the weight to be attached to Mrs. Shannon's evidence and constituting a weakness in the Crown's case which the learned trial judge was bound to draw to the attention of the jury, and the same considerations apply, although in a lesser degree, to Miss Koronko whose evidence must be viewed in light of the fact that the statements which she alleged to have been made by the appellant were withheld by her from the authorities for nearly three years.\nMr. Justice Mclnnes, who presided at the trial, pointed out to the jury that there were inconsistencies in the various statements made by Mrs. Shannon and stressed particularly the fact that in making three of these statements and in giving evidence at the inquest she had said nothing about the appellant's confession. In dealing with the evidence of both these witnesses, the learned trial judge said:\nYou saw these two women, Mrs. Shannon and Miss Koronko, under lengthy cross-examination by defence counsel. You have the fact that neither of them revealed what the accused told them for a long period afterwards. You will have to decide how they impressed you as witnesses and whether they are worthy of belief or not. It would be well for you in considering what degree of credibility you attach to their evidence to recall the evidence of Sergeant Davies as to the fingerprints and the manner in which they were put on the door according to Davies' evidence. Of course if you do not believe the women, then there is no necessity to consider Davies' evidence.\nAlthough it is true that Mr. Justice Mclnnes would have been justified in using stronger language to describe the weaknesses inherent in the evidence of both these witnesses, I am none the less of opinion that he said enough to indicate that in weighing their evidence the jury should give serious consideration to the inconsistencies in Mrs. Shannon's statements and to the failure of both women to come forward with their stories at an earlier date. I think that the theory of the defence that these two witnesses were unworthy of belief was expressed in the judge's charge with sufficient clarity to comply with the requirements indicated by this Court in Deacon v. The King[4] , and in the other cases referred to in the reasons for judgment delivered by Sheppard J.A. on behalf of the majority of the Court of Appeal. I would not quash the conviction on this ground, but there are more serious omissions which require consideration.\nThe whole tenor of the charge of the learned trial judge is to the effect that if the jury believed the evidence of Mrs. Shannon and Miss Koronko they would be justified in convicting, but there is a total absence of any direction on the question of whether, if the appellant did make the incriminating statements attributed to her by these women, those statements were in fact true.\nAt the trial Mrs. Shannon gave it as her opinion that the accused was intoxicated at the time of the alleged confession and in one of her previous statements she had said that she knew the appellant to be drunk and thought that she had lost her senses. Although the learned trial judge referred to these comments in instructing the jury as to the defence of drunkenness, he at no time gave them any instructions as to the effect of her having been intoxicated on the truth or falsity of what the appellant was alleged to have said. It is significant also that the nearest thing to an incriminating statement alleged to have been made to Miss Koronko was that made in December, 1961, when she says that the appellant was \"tight\". In my opinion in the present case the evidence of the appellant's intoxication was such as to make it desirable for the trial judge to tell the jury that it was a factor to be taken into consideration in assessing the value of her confession and her December 1961 statement to Miss Koronko as evidence against her.\nCounsel for the appellant also complained that the learned trial judge had omitted to tell the jury that they should consider the question of the truth or falsity of the appellant's alleged admission to the killing of her mother-in-law in light of the fact that Mrs. Shannon represented her as saying that she had \"killed her with her own panties\" whereas in fact according to the medical evidence the old lady met her death as a result of a blow or blows on the head and there was no suggestion that she could have been killed \"with her own panties\". In this regard it appears to me that the case of Kelsey v. The Queen[5] is particularly pertinent. That was a case of murder in which the accused was alleged to have confessed nearly two years after the event to killing the murdered man by striking him with a hammer and using an icepick \"to finish him\". The medical evidence was that the death had been caused by blows inflicted on the head by a blunt instrument and that there was also evidence of blows by a rigid, round and pointed instrument. Fauteux, J. in discussing non-direction by a trial judge as a ground of appeal had this to say:\nThe allotment of any substance to an argument or of any value to a grievance resting on the omission of the trial Judge from mentioning such argument must be conditioned on the existence in the record of some evidence or matter apt to convey a sense of reality in the argument and in the grievance. Had the autopsy, for instance, revealed poisoning instead of fracture of the skull as the cause of death, this undoubtedly would have, in this case, been a point of substance relevant to the theory of the defence. Far from conflicting with the appellant's admissions, independent proof of certain facts in the case tends to support his material admission, i.e. his participation in the commission of the murder.\nThe italics are my own.\nIn the present case the autopsy revealed that death was caused by blows on the head instead of the method to which the appellant allegedly confessed. In my view this was undoubtedly a point of substance relevant to the theory of the defence upon which the appellant was entitled to have the jury directed.\nI am in agreement with the views expressed in the reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice Davey in the Court of Appeal in so far as he says that:\nIf the statement that appellant killed the victim with her own panties clearly implied that appellant strangled her with them, the inconsistency of that statement with the absence of any evidence of strangulation or that the panties played any part in the cause of death, would cogently suggest that either Shannon's evidence or appellant's admission was untrue. In that case I would have had difficulty in supporting the verdict in the absence of a specific direction to the jury to consider the truth of the appellant's admission in the light of that discrepancy and the appellant's intoxication.\nThe italics are my own.\nMr. Justice Davey, however, took the view that defence counsel had not raised the defence that the statements made by Mrs. Shannon were untrue and he accordingly went on to say:\nMy difficulty is that the significance of the words 'with her own panties' in this context did not occur to either counsel at the trial and was not canvassed in the evidence. They might have meant something quite different from strangulation, and in my opinion it would be quite wrong to attach that meaning to the words when it was not suggested below or explored on the evidence. With the greatest respect, I do not share the difficulty expressed by Davey J.A. because I think that the contentention that the appellant's confession was false was implicit in the denial of guilt and I am also satisfied that the significance of the words \"with her own panties\" did occur to both counsel. While it is true that the references made to these words by defence counsel were primarily directed towards showing that Mrs. Shannon was not telling the truth, they none the less illustrate in the clearest terms the inconsistency between the method of killing described in the alleged confession and the cause of death as revealed by the medical evidence. On the other hand, it appears to me that Crown counsel invited the jury to consider that the evidence was consistent with the use of \"panties\" having produced strangulation or some other neck injury and having been a factor in the killing. I refer to the passage in which Crown counsel, after quoting the words \"\u2026 and she said that she had killed her with her own panties\" went on to say:\nNow may I just stop there for a moment while the thought crosses my mind. You might remember that bit of evidence in connection with the evidence of Dr. Harmon in which he testified as to the injuries to the neck of the deceased and the fingernail marks or scratches that appeared on the neck of the deceased woman.\nAs I have indicated, Dr. Harmon's evidence contained no suggestion that any neck injury caused or contributed to the death and he was not asked whether such injury as there was to the neck could have been caused by \"panties\", nor was such a thing suggested anywhere in his evidence.\nI am of opinion that even assuming that the inconsistency between the alleged confession and the autopsy was not raised by way of defence and notwithstanding the fact that defence counsel did not object to the learned trial judge's failure to comment on it, the charge to the jury should nevertheless have contained specific direction to the effect that the truth of the appellant's alleged admission was to be considered in light of this discrepancy and in light also of the appellant's intoxication at the time when the admission was alleged to have been made.\nThe case of McAskill v. The King[6] was one of murder in which the question of whether the appellant was so affected by drink as to be incapable of having the intent to kill was not directly raised by defence counsel and was not made the subject of direction by the learned trial judge. In considering the effect of the failure to put this issue before the jury, Duff J. said at page 335:\nThe able and experienced judge who presided at the trial properly directed the attention of the jury to the defence as it was put before them by counsel for the prisoner; and, having done this, he did not ask them to apply their minds to the further issue we have just defined. It was the prisoner's right, however, notwithstanding the course of his counsel at the trial, to have the jury instructed upon this feature of the case. We think, therefore, that there must be a new trial.\nI respectfully adopt this language as having direct application to the circumstances disclosed in the present case.\nIn view of all the above, I would allow this appeal, quash the conviction and direct that there be a new trial on the charge of manslaughter.\nABBOTT J. (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal, brought pursuant to leave, from the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia[7] pronounced on August 5, 1964, dismissing the appeal of the appellant from her conviction on December 5,1963, by the Honourable Mr. Justice McInnis and a jury at the Court of Assize in the City of Vancouver on a charge of manslaughter reduced from non-capital murder, on which charge the appellant was, on December 16, 1963, sentenced to eight years in prison.\nThe appellant was convicted on the said charge as a result of the death of her mother-in-law. The principal evidence identifying the appellant as the one who caused the death consisted of statements made in conversations which took place on a number of occasions between the appellant and her friend, Helena A. Shannon and between the appellant and her friend, Roberta Dale Koronko. The appellant did not give evidence at the trial.\nSince I have the misfortune to differ from the conclusion arrived at by the other members of this Court that a new trial should be ordered, and as it is not usual to discuss the details of the evidence when that course is followed, I shall simply state briefly the reasons for my dissent.\nThe contentions of the appellant upon which leave to appeal was granted are as follows:\n1. That the learned trial judge failed to instruct the Jury that it was dangerous and unsafe to accept or put much reliance upon the evidence of Helena C. Shannon because of her numerous prior inconsistent statements, both verbally and in writing and one prior inconsistent statement that was testified to under oath.\n2. That the learned trial judge misdirected the Jury, or alternatively failed to direct the Jury so as to be a misdirection in law in omitting to leave with them the fact that the admissions were capable of more than one inference, and in coupling the conversation as testified to by Dale Koronko of July 1960, with that of December 1961, so as to give the statement of the December 1961, an inference of guilt that the words standing alone would not naturally and normally bear.\n3. That the learned trial judge failed to instruct the Jury that even though they believed the evidence of Helena Shannon, they must still consider whether they would place any reliance on the admissions of the accused having regard to her state of sobriety at the time of making the same.\n4. That the learned trial judge failed to instruct the Jury that even though they believed the evidence of Dale Koronko, they must still consider whether they would place any reliance on the admissions of the accused having regard to her state of sobriety and her emotional condition at the time of said statement was made.\n5. That the learned trial judge erred in failing to direct the attention of the Jury to the fact that the admission alleged to have been made by the appellant indicated that the victim had been killed in a certain manner and that it was established that the victim had not been killed in that manner.\nThe principal argument made before us by Counsel for appellant related to the first ground, namely, that the learned trial judge failed to instruct the jury that it was dangerous and unsafe to put much reliance upon the evidence Helena Shannon because of what he contended were numerous prior inconsistent statements made by her, both verbally and in writing, and of one prior inconsistent statement under oath.\nCounsel submitted that there is a duty in law resting upon a trial judge to give such a warning concerning incriminating evidence of a person who has previously given contradictory evidence under oath; and that such a warning ought to be given concerning contradictory statements not under oath when the defence sets up the unreliability of the evidence given by that witness at the trial.\nThis contention was fully dealt with by Davey J.A. in the Court below with whose reasons and conclusions I am in complete agreement. After carefully reviewing the authorities from Re Harris[8]\u2014which decision he points out cannot be taken to correctly set forth the law of Canada\u2014 up to and including the decisions of this Court in Deacon v. The Queen[9],Binet v. The Queen[10] and Lucas v. The Queen[11] , he said:\nFrom these authorities it seems to me that the obligation to give such a direction arises not from a distinct rule of law or of practice, but from the obligation resting upon the trial Judge under Azoulay v. The Queen (1952) 2 S.C.R. 495, and Kelsey v. The Queen (1953) 1 S.C.R. 220, to review the substantial parts of the evidence, and to give the jury the theory of the defence, so that they may appreciate the value and effect of the evidence, and how the law is to be applied to the facts as they find them; and to present clearly to the jury the pivotal questions upon which the defence stands.\nAfter a further discussion of the nature of this obligation and a reference to certain authorities, he continued:\nIn the present case the learned trial judge charged most carefully upon the series of conflicting statements given by Shannon and Koronko, and left it to the jury to consider their effect, and the long delay in revealing the facts as they gave them in the box, upon their credibility and the weight of their evidence. In my opinion the defence was in this respect properly put to the jury without giving a warning that it would be dangerous to convict on such evidence considering the explanations and the amount of other confirming evidence.\nThe serious discrepancies in the earlier statements were the omission of the incriminating statements made by the appellant, and some of the surrounding detail. Shannon said she did not tell the full story in her earlier statements, because she was afraid of the appellant, and because she was not asked the appropriate questions to bring it out. But over and above that, both Shannon and Koronko were friends of the appellant and might well have withheld the incriminating information to help the appellant. So far as Shannon is concerned, there is no submission that she bore any enmity or ill will to the appellant that would lead to Shannon giving false evidence against her. There was no close connection or association between Shannon or Koronko, although they knew each other, that would cause Shannon to give false evidence against the appellant to favour Koronko. In view of the whole of the Crown's case, it would have been wrong for the learned trial judge to tell the jury that it would be dangerous to convict upon the evidence of Shannon and Koronko.\nAs to the other grounds raised by appellant relating to the truth of the statements made to Shannon and Koronko, drunkenness and the like, these too were fully dealt with in the Court below. I am in general agreement with what was said by Davey and Sheppard JJ.A. as to these grounds and have nothing to add.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nAppeal allowed and new trial directed, ABBOTT J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Oliver, Millar & Co., Vancouver.\nSolicitor for the respondent: G.

Martland, Judson and Hall JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nCrown\u2014Indian lands\u2014Right of Indian Band to possession of Reserve Land\u2014Right of lawful possessee to give by devise possession to non-Indian\u2014Action by Crown for possession on behalf of Band\u2014Indian Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 149, ss. 20, 82, 31(1), 50.\nThe Crown claimed, under s. 31(1) of the Indians Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 149, on behalf of the Six Nations Band of Indians possession of a farm which was part of the Band's Reserve Land in Ontario. In 1950, at the request of the defendant, who was not an Indian, and the widow of a member of the Band, who was lawfully in possession of the farm, a lease of the farm was granted by the Crown to the defendant for a term of ten years. Two years before the expiration of that lease, the widow died. By her will she devised her rights in the farm to the defendant who continued in possession for the balance of the term of the lease. The right in the land was then put up for sale, and the Crown, at the request of the purchaser who was a member of the Band, granted the defendant two successive permits for one year each. At the expiration of the second permit, the defendant refused to give up possession and the council of the Band moved to gain possession of the farm. The action by the Crown on behalf of the Band was dismissed by the Exchequer Court. The Crown appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Cartwright J. dissenting)': The appeal should be allowed.\nPer Taschereau C.J. and Martland, Judson and Hall JJ.: The rights of the defendant after the expiration of his second permit were governed by s. 50 of the Indian Act. Under that section, where a right to possession or occupation of land in a Reserve passes by devise to a person who is not entitled to reside on a Reserve, that right shall be offered for sale to the highest bidder among the persons who are entitled to reside on the Reserve and the proceeds of the sale shall be paid to the devisee. The procedure laid down by this section has been followed and the only rights of the defendant were to receive the proceeds of the sale of the right to possession. Section 31 does not require that an action to put a non-Indian off a Reserve can only, in respect of lands allocated to an individual Indian, be brought on behalf of that particular Indian. The action may be brought by the Crown on behalf of the Indian or the Band, depending upon who makes the allegation of wrongful possession or trespass.\nAn agreement entered into by the defendant and the purchaser which would have enabled the defendant to remain in possession at a rental which would have made it possible for the purchaser to make his instalment payments was void as the Department had not consented to any further lease or permit. The defendant must give up possession.\nPer Cartwright,' dissenting: The action could not succeed. Possession of the land was claimed on behalf of the Band, and on the evidence it was shown that the right to possession of the land in question was vested in an individual Indian and not in the Band. There is nothing in the Indian Act to alter the well-settled rule that to entitle a plaintiff to bring an action for the recovery of possession of land he must have a right of entry either legal or equitable.\nCouronne\u2014Terre appartenant aux Indiens\u2014Droit de la Bande \u00e0 la possession\u2014Terre situ\u00e9e sur la r\u00e9serve\u2014Droit du possesseur l\u00e9gal de donner par testament possession \u00e0 une personne qui n'est pas un Indien\u2014Action prise par la Couronne au nom de la Bande pour possession\u2014Loi sur les Indiens, S.R.C. 1952, c. 149, arts. 20, 28, 31(1), 50.\nSe basant sur I'art. 31(1) de la Loi sur les Indiens, S.R.C. 1952, c. 149, la Couronne a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 au nom de la Bande d'Indiens appel\u00e9e Six Nations possession d'une ferme qui faisait partie de la R\u00e9serve de la Bande en Ontario. En 1950, \u00e0 la demande du d\u00e9fendeur, qui n'\u00e9tait pas un Indien, et de la veuve d'un membre de la Bande, qui \u00e9tait en possession l\u00e9gale de la ferme, la Couronne a accord\u00e9 au d\u00e9fendeur un bail de la ferme pour un terme de dix ans. La veuve d\u00e9c\u00e9da deux ans avant I'expiration de ce bail. Par son testament elle l\u00e9gua ses droits dans la ferme au d\u00e9fendeur qui continua en possession pour la balance du terme du bail. Le droit \u00e0 cette terre fut alors offert en vente, et la Couronne, \u00e0 la demande de I'acheteur qui \u00e9tait un membre de la Bande, accorda au d\u00e9fendeur deux permis successifs d'une ann\u00e9e chacun. \u00c0 I'expiration du second permis, le d\u00e9fendeur refusa d'abandonner la possession et le conseil de la Bande commen\u00e7a des d\u00e9marches pour obtenir possession de la ferme.

En vertu de cet article, lorsqu'un droit \u00e0 la possession ou \u00e0 l'occupation de terres dans une R\u00e9serve passe par legs \u00e0 une personne non autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 y r\u00e9sider, ce droit doit \u00eatre offert en vente au plus haut ench\u00e9risseur entre les personnes habiles \u00e0 r\u00e9sider dans la R\u00e9serve et le produit de la vente doit \u00eatre vers\u00e9 au l\u00e9gataire. La proc\u00e9dure impos\u00e9e par cet article a \u00e9t\u00e9 suivie et les seuls droits du d\u00e9fendeur \u00e9taient de recevoir le produit de la vente du droit \u00e0 la possession. L'art. 31 ne requiert pas qu'une action, pour faire expulser une personne qui n'est pas un Indien de la R\u00e9serve, peut, quant \u00e0 une terre qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 allou\u00e9e \u00e0 un Indien en particulier, \u00eatre institu\u00e9e seulement au nom de cet Indien.

Appel maintenu, le Juge Cartwright \u00e9tant dissident.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Thurlow J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada[2] dismissing an action by the Crown on behalf of a Band of Indians to recover possession of land. Appeal allowed, Cartwright J. dissenting.\nN. A. Chalmers, for the appellant.\nP. A. Ballachey, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Taschereau C. J. and of Martland, Judson and Hall JJ. was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014The judgment of the Exchequer Court1 from which this appeal is taken rejects the Crown's claim for possession of a farm of 225 acres which is part of the Six Nations Indian Reserve in the County of Brant, Ontario. The action was brought under s. 31(1) of the Indian Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 149, which reads:\n31. (1) Without prejudice to section 30, where an Indian or a band alleges that persons other than Indians are or have been (a) unlawfully in occupation or possession of,\n(b) claiming adversely the right to occupation or possession of, or\n(c) trespassing upon\na reserve or part of a reserve, the Attorney General of Canada may exhibit an Information in the Exchequer Court of Canada claiming, on behalf of the Indian or the band, the relief or remedy sought.\nThe defendant, Harry Devereux, is not an Indian. He has assisted in the working of this farm since 1934, when he entered into a leasing agreement with Rachel Ann Davis, the widow of a member of the Six Nations Band. This private arrangement was void under s. 34(2) of the Indian Act , R.S.C. 1927, c. 98 , now R.S.C. 1952, c. 149, s. 28(1), but at the request of Mrs. Davis and the defendant, the Crown granted to the defendant a lease of the farm for a term of ten years commencing December 1, 1950. This lease expired on November 30, 1960. On the expiry of the lease, two successive permits were granted to the defendant under s. 28(2) of the Indian Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 149, allowing him to use and occupy the lands for agricultural purposes. The second of these permits expired on November 30, 1962. The defendant nevertheless still remains in possession of the lands. He claims his rights by devise under a will of Rachel Ann Davis, dated November 19, 1953, and admitted to probate in the Surrogate Court of the County of Brant on May 30, 1958. Rachel Ann Davis died on April 25, 1958.\nIn November 1962, the band council notified the defendant to vacate the property at the expiration of his permit, and in January, 1963, the Indian Superintendent at Brant-ford notified him to vacate on or before January 31, 1963.\nOn July 4, 1963, the band council passed a resolution alleging that the defendant was still unlawfully in possession of the lands and asking that the Attorney General of Canada bring this action.\nIt is clear that subsequent to November 30, 1962, the defendant can point to no applicable provision of the Indian Act which gives him the right to possess or use the lands in question.\nWhen Mrs. Davis died in 1958, her title was that of locatee under s. 20, subs. (1), of the Indian Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 149. She held a certificate of possession dated February 28, 1954, issued under s. 20, subs. (2) of the Act. The rights of the defendant after the expiry of his permit on November 30, 1962, which was four years after the death of Mrs. Davis, are governed by s. 50 of the Act:\n50. (1) A person who is not entitled to reside on a reserve does not by devise or descent acquire a right to possession or occupation of land in that reserve.\n(2) Where a right to possession or occupation of land in a reserve passes by devise or descent to a person who is not entitled to reside on a reserve, that right shall be offered for sale by the superintendent to the highest bidder among persons who are entitled to reside on the reserve and the proceeds of the sale shall be paid to the devisee or descendant, as the case may be.\n(3) Where no tender is received within six months or such further period as the Minister may direct after the date when the right to possession or occupation is offered for sale under subsection (2), the right shall revert to the band free from any claim on the part of the devisee or descendant, subject to the payment, at the discretion of the Minister, to the devisee or descendant, from the funds of the band, of such com pensation for permanent improvements as the Minister may determine.\n(4) The purchaser of a right to possession or occupation of land under subsection (2) shall be deemed not to be in lawful possession or occupation of the land until the possession is approved by the Minister.\nThe procedure laid down by this section has been followed and the only rights of the defendant are now to receive the proceeds of the sale. This sale is not a cash transaction. The proceeds will be payable over a period of years.\nThe Exchequer Court, in dismissing the action, held, in effect, that in respect of land allocated to an individual Indian, an action under s. 31 above quoted would lie only at the instance of the individual Indian locatee and not at the instance of the band. In so holding I think there was error. I do not think that s. 31 requires that an action to put a non-Indian off a reserve can only, in respect of lands allocated to an individual Indian, be brought on behalf of that particular Indian. The terms of the section to me appear to be plain. The action may be brought by the Crown on behalf of the Indian or the band, depending upon who makes the allegation of wrongful possession or trespass.\nThe judgment under appeal involves a serious modification of the terms of s. 31(1). Instead of reading \"Where an Indian or a band\" alleges unlawful possession by a non-Indian, it should be understood to read \"Where an Indian in respect of land allocated to him or a band in respect of unallocated land\" makes the allegation of unlawful possession. I think that this interpretation is erroneous and that its acceptance would undermine the whole administration of the Act by enabling an Indian to make an unauthorized arrangement with a non-Indian and then, by refusing to make an individual complaint, enable the non-Indian to remain indefinitely.\nThe scheme of the Indian Act is to maintain intact for bands of Indians, reserves set apart for them regardless of the wishes of any individual Indian to alienate for his own benefit any portion of the reserve of which he may be a locatee. This is provided for by s. 28(1) of the Act. If s. 31 were restricted as to lands of which there is a locatee to actions brought at the instance of the locatee, agreements void under s. 28(1) by a locatee with a non-Indian in the alienation of reserve land would be effective and the whole scheme of the Act would be frustrated.\nReserve lands are set apart for and inalienable by the band and its members apart from express statutory provisions even when allocated to individual Indians. By definition (s. 2(1) (o)) \"reserve\" means\na tract of land, the legal title to which is vested in Her Majesty, that has been set apart by Her Majesty for the use and benefit of a band.\nBy s. 2(1) (a), \"band\" means a body of Indians\n(i) for whose use and benefit in common, lands, the legal title to which is vested in Her Majesty, have been set apart \u2026\nBy s. 18, reserves are to be held for the use and benefit of Indians. They are not subject to seizure under legal process (s. 29). By s. 37, they cannot be sold, alienated, leased or otherwise disposed of, except where the Act specially provides, until they have been surrendered to the Crown by the band for whose use and benefit in common the reserve was set apart. There is no right to possession and occupation acquired by devise or descent in a person who is not entitled to reside on the reserve (s. 50, subs. (1)).\nOne of the exceptions is that the Minister may lease for the benefit of any Indian upon his application for that purpose, the land of which he is lawfully in possession without the land being surrendered (s. 58(3)). It was under this section that the Minister had the power to make the ten-year lease to the defendant which expired on November 30, 1960.\nUnder this Act there are only two ways in which this defendant could be lawfully in possession of this farm, either under a lease made by the Minister for the benefit of any Indian under s. 58(3), or under a permit under s. 28(2). Evidence was given of attempted arrangements between the defendant and the purchaser and the assignee of the purchaser under s. 50(2) which would have enabled the defendant to remain in possession at a rental which would have made it possible for the purchaser to make his instalment payments. The Crown took the position that these attempted arrangements were irrelevant, the Department not having consented to any further lease or permit. This objection was properly taken and the attempted arrangements do not assist in any way the defendant's claim to remain in possession. He also says that as an unpaid vendor who has not contracted to give up possession, he is entitled to remain in possession until he receives the full proceeds of the sale by the Superintendent made under s. 50 of the Act. He has no such right. He must give up possession and his right is limited by s. 50 to the receipt of the proceeds.\nThere should, therefore, be judgment for Her Majesty on behalf of the Six Nations Band of Indians that vacant possession of the lands be delivered with costs in this Court and in the Exchequer Court.\nCARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):\u2014The facts and statutory provisions relevant to the solution of the questions raised on this appeal are set out in the reasons of my brother Judson and in those of Thurlow J.\nOn the argument of the appeal we were told by counsel that the respondent is still in actual occupation of the lands in question. For the purposes of the appeal I am prepared to assume that the respondent has not shewn any right to remain in possession of these lands.\nThe action was commenced by an Information in which \"Her Majesty the Queen on the Information of the Deputy Attorney General of Canada\" is plaintiff and the respondent is defendant. The Information does not in terms allege that the Six Nations Band of Indians, hereinafter sometimes referred to as \"the Band\" is entitled to possession of the lands but does state that the Band has demanded vacant possession of the lands from the defendant and that he has refused to vacate the same. The prayer for relief so far as relevant reads:\nThe Deputy Attorney General of Canada, on behalf of Her Majesty, claims-as follows:\u2014\n(a) vacant possession of the said lands on behalf of the Six Nations Band of Indians. It will be observed that possession is not claimed by Her Majesty in her own right but only on behalf of the Band. This is in accordance with the provisions of s. 31 of the Indian Act which so far as relevant reads:\n31. (1) Without prejudice to section 30, where an Indian or a band alleges that persons other than Indians are or have been\n(a) unlawfully in occupation or possession of \u2026a reserve or part of a reserve, the Attorney General of Canada may exhibit an Information in the Exchequer Court of Canada claiming, on behalf of the Indian or the band, the relief or remedy sought.\nI can find no ambiguity in this section. It contemplates, as do many other provisions of the Act, that the right to possession of a parcel of land in a reserve may belong to the Band or to an individual Indian. The claim for possession is to be made either on behalf of the Band if it is entitled to possession or on behalf of the individual Indian if he is so entitled.\nI agree with Thurlow J. that the evidence shews that the right to possession of the lands in question is vested in Hubert Clause or in Arnold and Gladys Hill, all of; whom are Indians and members of the Band, and not in the Band.\nI also agree with Thurlow J. when he says:\nWhen a member of a band obtains lawful possession of land in a reserve the right which the band would otherwise have to possession of that land is at an end, though circumstances may arise in which the band may once again have a right of possession either by purchase of the individual members' right or on reversion of the right to the band under ss. 25(2) or 50(3). The statutory scheme accordingly in my opinion contemplates a statutory right of possession of any part of a reserve being vested in an individual member of a band, or in the band itself, but not in the band when it is vested in the individual member.\nThe applicable principle of law is accurately stated in the passage from Williams and Yates on Ejectment, 2nd ed., page 1 et seq, quoted and adopted by Thurlow J., and particularly the following sentences:\nTo entitle a plaintiff to bring an action for the recovery of possession of land he must have a right of entry either legal or equitable. A right of entry means a right to enter and take actual possession of lands, tenaments, or hereditaments, as incident to some estate or interest therein.\n***\nThe right of entry must be a right to the immediate possession of the property. A reversionary or other future estate is not sufficient until it has become an estate in possession.\nI can find nothing in the Indian Act to alter these well settled rules as to actions for the possession of the land. For the reasons briefly stated above and for those given by Thurlow J., with which I am in full agreement, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed, CARTWRIGHT, J. dissenting.\nSolicitor for the Appellant: E. A. Driedger, Ottawa.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Ballachey, Moore & Hart, Brantford.\n[1] [1965] 1 Ex. C.R. 602.\n[2] [1965] 1 Ex. C.R. 602.\n",

The Commissioner had refused the patentee's request that it be allowed an oral hearing or to cross-examine the licensee on the supporting affidavits filed with the application. The Exchequer Court found that the Commissioner's refusal was not a denial of justice as contended by the patentee. The latter appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe Commissioner was correct when he said that, there being no regulations governing the practice under s. 41(3), he was entitled to set the procedures and was not bound to hold a hearing on demand by one of the parties. It was for the Commissioner to decide whether or not the circumstances required an oral hearing, cross-examination upon affidavits, or oral submissions. His decision not to require any of these things could not be considered to be a denial of natural justice. Furthermore, the patentee had failed to establish any valid ground for disturbing the Commissioner's decision. The patentee had submitted what it contended were good reasons not to grant the licence. These were considered by the Commissioner and rejected. The patentee has not established that the Commissioner had acted on a wrong principle or that, on the evidence, his decision was manifestly wrong.

Le Commissaire avait refus\u00e9 au titulaire du brevet de lui accorder une audition ou de lui permettre de contre-interroger le porteur de la licence sur les affidavits produits au soutien de la demande. La Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier a jug\u00e9 que le refus du Commissaire n'\u00e9tait pas un d\u00e9ni de justice tel que le pr\u00e9tendait le titulaire du brevet. Ce dernier en appela devant cette Cour.\nArr\u00eat: L'appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9.\nLe Commissaire avait raison lorsqu'il a dit que, puisqu'il n'existait aucun r\u00e9glement r\u00e9gissant la proc\u00e9dure sous l'art. 41(3), il avait droit d'\u00e9tablir la proc\u00e9dure et n'\u00e9tait pas oblig\u00e9 de tenir une audition sur la demande d'une des parties. Il appartenait au Commissaire de d\u00e9cider si les circonstances requ\u00e9raient une audition, un contre-interrogatoire sur affidavits, ou des soumissions orales. Sa d\u00e9cision de ne requ\u00e9rir aucune de ces choses ne pouvait pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant un d\u00e9ni de la justice naturelle. Bien plus, le titulaire du brevet n'a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 \u00e9tablir aucun motif valide pour faire changer le d\u00e9cision du Commissaire. Le titulaire du brevet avait soumis ce qu'il pr\u00e9tendait \u00eatre des bonnes raisons pour que la licence ne soit pas accord\u00e9e. Ces raisons furent consid\u00e9r\u00e9es par le Commissaire et rejet\u00e9es. Le titulaire du brevet n'a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 \u00e9tablir que le Commissaire avait agi en vertu d'un mauvais principe ou que, en se basant sur la preuve, sa d\u00e9cision avait \u00e9t\u00e9 manifestement erron\u00e9e.\nAPPEL d'un jugement du Juge Thurlow de la Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier du Canada[1], maintenant en partie une d\u00e9cision du Commissaire des Brevets. Appel rejet\u00e9.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Thurlow J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada[2] , maintaining in part a decision of the Commissioner of Patents. Appeal dismissed.\nGordon F. Henderson, Q.C., and R. G. McClenahan, for the appellant.\nD. J. Wright and W. L. Hayhurst, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the Exchequer Court of Canada[3] against the judgment of Thurlow J., who dismissed, in part, an appeal by the present appellant from a decision made by the Commissioner of Patents which, pursuant to s. 41(3) of the Patent Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 203, had granted to the respondent a licence to use, for the purpose of the preparation or production of medicine, the invention patented by Canadian Patent No. 612,497, dated January 10, 1961, held by the appellant. The Commissioner settled the royalty to be payable by the respondent to the appellant. The learned trial judge directed that that issue be referred back to the Commissioner for reconsideration and there is no appeal from that direction. The sole issue before us is as to whether the granting of the licence by the Commissioner was a valid exercise of his powers under s. 41(3).\nThe respondent's application for a licence under s. 41(3) was dated March 20, 1962. It was supported by the affidavit of its president. The patent in question is described in that application as follows:\nPatent No. 612,497 is governed by section 41(3) since the invention claimed is intended for and capable of being used for the preparation and production of 1, 4\u2014benzodiazepine 4\u2014oxides and acid addition salts thereof, and these products are medicines within the meaning of the section, being useful as sedatives and tranquilizers for humans. Generic names of the products are methaminodiazepoxide and chlordiazepoxide. The patentee sells the products under the trade mark LIBRIUM.\nThe respondent described its own capacities in the application as follows:\nThe applicant and its predecessor Delmar Chemical Company have, since, 1941, been engaged in the synthesis and manufacture of many pharmaceutical fine chemicals, most of them organic synthetics, used as medicines within the meaning of section 41(3). The applicant is a substantial and reputable company with the facilities and technical know-how for manufacturing the product claimed in Patent No. 612,497 by the process claimed therein and is ready, willing and able to manufacture it by such process in its own premises in Canada and with its own equipment and personnel.\nOn April 2 the Commissioner wrote to the appellant advising of the application and that the respondent had been requested to serve on the appellant a copy of the application and affidavit. The letter went on to say:\nYou will have sixty days within which to file with me your counter-statement supported by affidavit and serve a true copy on the representative of the applicant Ridout & Maybee, 111 Richmond Street, West, Toronto 1, Canada.\nThe applicant will have thirty days to file a reply with me and serve a copy thereof upon you.\nOn the same date the Commissioner wrote to the respondent advising as to the steps to be taken regarding notice of its application, by way of advertising and notice to the appellant, and the times fixed for filing the appellant's counterstatement and the respondent's reply.\nOn May 25 appellant's solicitors wrote to the Commissioner requesting additional time for filing the counterstatement, because most of the technical information required to formulate it would have to be obtained from the office of the appellant's parent company in Switzerland. The Commissioner granted an extension of two months, until August 8.\nThe counterstatement was dated July 25 and supported by the affidavit of a vice-president of the appellant. It described the invention as belonging to a new class of compound not theretofore employed in medical therapeutics. It described the advantageous purposes of \"Librium\" and stated that the manufacturing process involved the use of highly volatile solids, dangerous to inhale. It stated that the respondent's described production facilities were not adequate to cope with the manufacture of Librium. It pointed out that if the licence were granted the quality of manufacturing, storage and capsulating treatment accorded the drug would no longer be subject to control, and urged that public interest would not be served by making the drug open and available to the public free from control.\nAlong with the counterstatement the appellant's solicitors filed a \"demand for hearing\" in respect of the application.\nOn August 8 the Commissioner wrote to the appellant's solicitors pointing out that there were no regulations governing the practice under s. 41(3), that he was entitled to set the procedure and that he was not bound to hold a hearing on demand by one of the parties. He pointed out that the respondent had thirty days to file a reply and that after that time he would decide whether a hearing was warranted or not.\nA reply, dated August 13, was filed by the respondent.\nOn September 7 solicitors for the appellant wrote to the Commissioner in support of a request for a hearing, or, alternatively, a request to cross-examine the president of the respondent on his affidavits supporting the respondent's application and reply. The letter contended that issues of public safety and matters of public concern were involved in the application. With respect to the matter of public safety, stress was laid upon risks involved in connection with the manufacture of the product. The appellant also urged that the manufacture of a product of inferior quality could destroy the reputation of Librium and have a detrimental effect upon the reputation of the appellant. It was suggested that the Commissioner inspect the respective plants of the appellant and the respondent.\nOn September 14 respondent's solicitors wrote a letter to the Commissioner in reply to this letter.\nOn November 19 the Commissioner wrote to the appellant's solicitors advising that he need not inspect the plants, and that he would decide, within a few weeks, whether a hearing would be held.\nOn November 23 appellant's solicitors again wrote to the Commissioner, stating that the respondent was not considered competent to produce a safe product and that improper control in the manufacture and handling of the product would create dangers to those handling it and to the consumers. A further demand for a hearing was made.\nOn February 6, 1963, the Commissioner made his decision. After reciting the provisions of s. 41 (3) of the Patent Act he went on to say:\nThe Commissioner has no choice but to grant a licence, unless he sees good reason to the contrary. There being no regulations governing his inquiry, he is at liberty to use his judgment in any individual case in order to arrive at a just and fair conclusion.\nIn the present case the patentee has forcefully objected to the grant of a licence mainly on the grounds that the process is one which involves a great deal of care on account of some volatile and unstable substances used therein or obtained therefrom.\nOn the other hand the applicant claims that he was aware of the process having verified experimentally, on an adequate scale, that he can produce the products economically. Again in his reply to the counterstatement which stresses the dangers contingent with the process and the instability of some of the products involved the applicant reaffirms his awareness of the difficulties. He then goes on to name some of the hazardous substances and unstable chemical compounds which he handles.\nI have no reason to believe that the applicant has not the ability to make the compound. He is a well known manufacturer of synthetic organic compounds.\nI therefore decide that no hearing is necessary in this case and that the petition should be granted.\nI have recited the various steps which occurred prior to the Commissioner's decision in some detail because the appellant contends that there was, in this case, a denial of natural justice.\nThe appellant's appeal from the Commissioner's decision to the Exchequer Court was dismissed, and the appellant now appeals to this Court.\nThe relevant provision of the Patent Act, s. 41(3), provides as follows:\n(3) In the case of any patent for an invention intended for or capable of being used for the preparation or production of food or medicine, the Commissioner shall, unless he sees good reason to the contrary, grant to any person applying for the same, a licence limited to the use of the invention for the purposes of the preparation or production of food or medicine but not otherwise; and, in settling the terms of such licence and fixing the amount of royalty or other consideration payable the Commissioner shall have regard to the desirability of making the food or medicine available to the public at the lowest possible price consistent with giving to the inventor due reward for the research leading to the invention.\nThis subsection does not lay down any procedure to be followed by the Commissioner before reaching his decision and, in this respect, differs materially from proceedings under ss. 67 to 72 of the Act in respect of allegations of an abuse of patent rights. Under s. 71(2) any of the parties in such proceedings may demand a hearing.\nIn my opinion the Commissioner was correct when he said in the present case, in his letter to the appellant's solicitors, dated August 8, 1962, that, there being no regulations governing the practice under s. 41(3), he was entitled to set the procedures and was not bound to hold a hearing on demand by one of the parties.\nCounsel for the appellant did not contend that a party to a proceeding under s. 41(3) could demand a hearing, but he did urge that the failure of the Commissioner to permit cross-examination upon the affidavits filed by the respondent to support its application and its reply and to permit oral argument was a denial of justice in the circumstances of the present case.\nVarious authorities were cited by the appellant regarding the subject of natural justice, including the decision of the 'House of Lords in Ridge v. Baldwin[4] . It is, however, unnecessary to embark on a discussion of the principles laid down in that and other similar, cases because, in the circumstances of this case, whether he was obligated to do so or not, the Commissioner did cause the respondent to serve the appellant with a copy of the application and affidavit; he did furnish to the appellant ample opportunity to present its case in writing, and the appellant did make written submissions to the Commissioner.\nI have already referred to the substantial difference which exists between an application under s. 41(3) and one made under s. 67 or 68 in respect of the procedural requirements. As the Commissioner correctly pointed out in this case, he was entitled to set the procedures, and he did so. It was for him to decide whether or not the circumstances required an oral hearing, cross-examination upon affidavits, or oral submissions. In my opinion, his decision not to require any of these things cannot be considered to be a denial of natural justice to the appellant.\nI am also of the opinion that the appellant has failed to establish any valid ground for disturbing the decision which the Commissioner has reached. Section 41(3) required him to grant to the respondent the licence applied for by it, unless he saw good reason to the contrary. The appellant submitted to him what it contended were good reasons to the contrary, and these were considered by him. As was pointed out in Parke, Davis & Company v. Fine Chemicals of Canada, Limited[5] , the decision was his to make. While an appeal lies from that decision, in order to succeed it is for the appellant to show that he acted on a wrong principle or that, on the evidence, the decision was manifestly wrong. In my opinion the appellant has not established either of these things in the present case.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Gowling, MacTavish, Osborne & Henderson, Ottawa.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Ridout & Maybee, Toronto.\n[1] [1965] 1 Ex.

The taxpayer moved for an order quashing the appeal or, alternatively, for an order striking from the notice of appeal all passages alleging misrepresentation or fraud. Both motions were dismissed by the Exchequer Court. The taxpayer applied for leave to appeal to this Court. The substantial question to be debated on the appeal would be whether an appeal from the Income Tax Appeal Board to the Exchequer Court was in the nature of a trial de novo.\nHeld: The application for leave to appeal should be refused.\nIt has already been decided in Campbell v. M.N.R., [1953] 1 S.C.R. 3, that an appeal from the Tax Appeal Board to the Exchequer Court was a trial de novo.\nThe striking out of parts of the notice of appeal deals with a procedural matter. S. 99(2) of the Income Tax Act gives the Court or a judge a discretionary power to do so, and it was never intended that decisions in the Exchequer Court on ordinary questions of practice or procedure should be subject to revision by this Court.\nAppels\u2014Revenu\u2014Imp\u00f4t sur le revenu\u2014Permission d'appeler\u2014Un appel \u00e0 la Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier d'un jugement de la Commission d'Appel de I'Imp\u00f4t sur le Revenu est-il un proc\u00e8s de novo\u2014La d\u00e9cision de la Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier sur une mati\u00e8re de proc\u00e9dure est-elle sujette \u00e0 revision par la Cour supr\u00eame\u2014Loi de l'Imp\u00f4t sur le Revenu, S.R.C. 1952, c. 148, arts. 91, 99(2).\nLa Couronne appela \u00e0 la Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier d'un jugement de la Commission d'Appel de l'Imp\u00f4t sur le Revenu.

Johnston, Q.C., for the applicant.\nD. S. Maxwell, Q.C., contra.\nThe following judgment was delivered by\nHALL J. (in Chambers):\u2014The application for leave to appeal to this Court from the judgment of the learned President of the Exchequer Court dismissing an application by the applicants for an order quashing the respondent's appeal from the judgment of the Tax Appeal Board dated August 20, 1964, with respect to an income tax assessment for the 1953 taxation year and which also dismissed a motion by the applicants for an order striking out from the respondent's Notice of Appeal in respect of the assessment for the 1953 taxation year all those parts thereof alleging misrepresentation or fraud should be refused. The substantial question, namely, whether an appeal from the Tax Appeal Board to the Exchequer Court of Canada is or is not in the nature of a trial de novo which the applicants contend should be dealt with by the Supreme Court of Canada has already been decided by the Court in Campbell v. Minister of National Revenue.[1]\nIn that case, Locke J., speaking for the Court, said: The proceedings on an appeal in such matters to the Exchequer Court are in the nature of a trial de novo and the appellant again gave evidence in that Court (1951) Ex. C.R. 290 and was cross-examined at length, and further evidence was given by his wife as to the reasons which had led her husband to sell certain of the properties.\nand at p. 6:\nWhile the proceedings before the Income Tax Appeal Board under the provisions of the Income Tax Act are by way of appeal from decisions of the Minister, the proceedings in the present matter are indistinguishable from those upon the trial of issues in other courts of record. By subsection 2 of section 91 of the Act, upon completion of the steps required by the statute on an appeal to the Exchequer Court, the matter is to be deemed as an action in that Court and the proceedings are conducted in the same manner as in other actions.\nMr. Johnston argued that these extracts from Campbell v. Minister of National Revenue, supra, were obiter dicta. I am unable to agree with that submission. In Goldman v. Minister of National Revenue;[2] the Honourable Mr. Justice Thorson, then President of the Court, went very fully into the point in issue here and concluded with this statement with which I agree:\nThere are, I think, several reasons for accepting the submission of counsel for the appellant that the appeal to this Court from a decision of the Income Tax Appeal Board, whether by the taxpayer or the Minister, is a trial de novo of the issues involved therein. While there are several descriptions of the proceedings as an appeal and while it is true that on the appeal the Registrar of the Income Tax Act Appeal Board is required by section 91(1) of the Income Tax Act to transmit to the Registrar of this Court \"all papers filed with the Board on the appeal thereto together with a transcript of the record of the proceedings before the Board\" there is no provision that the appeal must be based on such record. On the contrary, section 89(3) requires the appellant to set out in the notice of appeal a statement of the allegations of fact, the statutory provisions and reasons which he intends to submit in support of his appeal and section 90(1) calls upon the respondent to serve and file a reply to the notice of appeal admitting or denying the facts alleged and containing a statement of such further allegations of fact and of such statutory provisions and reasons as he intends to rely on. There is nothing in these provisions to restrict the parties to the allegations of fact made before the Board. Additional facts or even different facts may be alleged. Then section 91(2) provides that upon the filing of the material referred to in section 91(1) or 91A and of the reply required by section 90, \"the matter shall be deemed to be an action in the court and, unless the Court otherwise orders ready for hearing\". This section is almost identical with section 63(2) of the Income War Tax Act. Its purpose is to give the parties the benefits of the proceedings in an action to establish their respective allegations which would not be available in an ordinary appeal. There would be no purpose in these provisions if Parliament intended that the appeal should be heard on the basis of the record before the Income Tax Appeal Board. They contemplate that the issues as defined by the statement of facts and the reply should be tried by this Court according to the processes of an action in this Court. This necessitates a trial de novo. While this view lends itself to the possibility that the taxpayer or the Minister may make a different case or defence in this Court from that made before the Board and it may seem anomalous that Parliament should permit this there is nothing in the Act to bar it. The freedom of the Court to deal with the issues raised before it, without regard to the proceedings before the Board, is further indicated by the provision in section 91(3) that any fact or statutory provision not set out in the notice of appeal or reply may be pleaded or referred to in such manner and upon such terms as the Court may direct and by the power given to the court by section 91(4) of disposing of the appeal by dismissing it, vacating or varying the assessment or referring it back to the Minister.\nAll these considerations lead to the conclusion that the appeal to this Court from a decision of the Income Tax Appeal Board, whether by the taxpayer or by the Minister, is a trial de novo of the issues involved, that the parties are not restricted to the issues either of fact or of law that were before the Board but are free to raise whatever issues they wish even if different from those raised before the Board and that it is the duty of the Court to hear and determine such issues without regard to the proceedings before the Board and without being affected by any findings made by it.\nThe second branch of the application, namely, to strike out certain parts of the Notice of Appeal with respect to the 1953 taxation year clearly deals with a procedural matter. Section 99(2) of the Income Tax Act gives the Court or a judge the discretionary power to strike out a Notice of Appeal or any part thereof. The learned President, Mr. Justice Jackett, in exercising his discretion, refused to strike out the parts of the Notice of Appeal objected to.\n\u2026it was never intended that decisions in the Exchequer Court on ordinary questions of practice or procedure should be subject to revision by this Court.\nKerwin C.J. in Coast Construction Company v. The King.[3] The application for leave to appeal will therefore be dismissed with costs.\nApplication dismissed.\nSolicitors for the applicants: Lash, Johnston, Sheard. & Pringle, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the respondent: E. S. MacLatchy, Ottawa.\n[1] [1953] 1 S.C.R. 3, [1952] C.T.C. 334, [1952] D.T.C. 1187.\n[2] [1951] Ex. C.R. 274 at 279, [1951] C.T.C. 241.\n[3] [1951] S.C.R. 759 at 762.\n",

Cundy, [1965] S.C.R. 586\nDate: 1965-04-06\nWeldwood - Westply Limited (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nDouglas N. Cundy (Defendant) Respondent.\n1965: March 3, 4; 1965: April 6.\nPresent: Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA, APPELLATE DIVISION\nContracts\u2014Novation\u2014Agreement to assume third party liability to extent of specific amount\u2014Covenant to continue to do business with third party\u2014Further extension of credit later refused\u2014Whether failure of consideration\u2014Justification in withholding further credit.\nOn May 11, 1962, the plaintiff company entered into an agreement with the defendant whereby the defendant agreed to assume $20,000 of the liability owing by company B to the plaintiff in consideration of certain covenants and in particular in consideration of the plaintiff continuing to do business with B. The defendant undertook to pay the $20,000 on or before August 11, 1962, and, following the execution of the agreement, he had B issue in his favour forty $500 post-dated cheques. The defendant endorsed and delivered these cheques to the plaintiff. After ten cheques were paid, three were dishonoured by nonpayment when presented. The plaintiff then refused to extend further credit to B. It credited the defendant with the $5,000 received and after August 11, 1962, brought action for the balance of $15,000. The trial judge held that the plaintiff was justified in refusing to continue to extend credit after the three cheques were dishonoured. The Appellate Division reversed the trial judge on the basis that there had been an entire failure of consideration, thus relieving the defendant of his liability for the balance of the $20,000. An appeal was brought to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the judgment at trial restored.\nPer Curiam: It was beyond question that the defendant assumed the liability of B to the extent of $20,000 and the plaintiff released B to the extent of this amount. That constituted a novation. Commercial Bank of Tasmania v. Jones, [1893] A.C. 313, referred to.\nIt was held that there was no failure of consideration. Business was carried on as usual after May 11th and credit was extended until it became apparent on the three cheques being dishonoured that B was finding it impossible to pay its liabilities as they became due. The plaintiff was justified in withholding further credit in the situation as it then developed. Royal Bank of Canada v. Salvatori, [1928] 3 W.W.R. 501, discussed; Royal Bank of Canada v. Mills, [1932] 3 W.W.R. 283, applied.\nPer Spence J.: The defence that there could not be a novation of only part of the old debt failed. Re Abernethy-Lougheed Logging Co., Attorney-General for British Columbia v. Salter, [1940] 1 W.W.R. 319, distinguished; Hodgson v. Anderson (1825), 3 B. & C. 842; Fairlie v. Denton and Barker (1828), 8 B. & C. 395, referred to. The further defence that the plaintiff's covenant to continue to do business with B was a condition precedent to the defendant's covenant to pay to the plaintiff the sum of $20,000, and that the plaintiff in breach of that covenant failed to continue to do business with B and freed the defendant from his covenant was also rejected. In the circumstances, there was no breach of the condition precedent.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta allowing an appeal from a judgment of Kirby J. Appeal allowed.\nG. H. Steer, Q.C., for the plaintiff, appellant.\nW. K. Moore, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Hall JJ. was delivered by\nHALL J.:\u2014On May 11, 1962, an agreement was entered into between the appellant and the respondent as follows:\nWHEREAS Four Square Lumber (Buildings) Ltd., hereinafter referred to as \"Four Square\" a body corporate carrying on business in the City of Calgary, in the Province of Alberta, is indebted to Weldwood for an amount exceeding $20,000.00.\nAND WHEREAS Weldwood is concerned at the amount of the indebtedness of Four Square and has asked Four Square and Cundy for further and better security as a consideration of Weldwood continuing to do business with Four Square.\nAND WHEREAS Cundy has agreed to assume $20,000.00 of the liability owing by Four Square to Weldwood.\nNOW THIS AGREEMENT WITNESSETH that in consideration of the covenants herein expressed and in particular in consideration of Weldwood continuing to do business with Four Square which will be to your direct advantage as Cundy being an officer and\/or shareholder thereof, it is mutually agreed between the parties hereto as follows:\n1.\u2014CUNDY hereby agrees to assume and promises to pay to Weldwood $20,000.00 of the indebtedness owing by Four Square to Weldwood.\n2.\u2014WELDWOOD hereby releases and discharges Four Square from any liability on the present indebtedness in the sum of $20,000.00.\n3.\u2014CUNDY promises to pay to Weldwood the sum of $20,000.00 on or before the 11th day of August, A.D. 1962 at the offices of Weldwood at 5707\u20143rd Street South East, Calgary, Alberta, to bear interest at the rate of 6% on the unpaid balance.\n4.\u2014Paragraph 3 hereof shall be considered a Promissory Note payable by Cundy in which the consideration is presumed.\n5.\u2014The parties hereto agree to execute such further documents and assurances to give effect to this Agreement.\nThis Agreement shall be binding on the parties hereto, their executors and successors or assigns. The circumstances leading up to the execution of this agreement may be summarized as follows. Between September 1957 and June 1962 Western Plywood Company Limited and its successor, Weldwood-Westply Limited, the appellant, supplied lumber and other building materials on a large scale to Four Square (Alberta) Lumber and its successor, Four Square Lumber (Buildings) Ltd. Throughout the most of this period the latter companies enjoyed and were allowed from sixty (60) to ninety (90) days to pay for the materials supplied, and at times enjoyed credit to the extent of $48,223.\nIn the fall of 1961 Western Plywood Company Limited was taken over by American interests and the company name emerged as Weldwood-Westply Limited. Immediately following the takeover by American interests, Allan H. Young, the manager of Weldwood-Westply Limited, the appellant herein, expressed concern to the respondent, a director and substantial creditor of Four Square Lumber (Buildings) Ltd., about the indebtedness of such company to Weldwood-Westply Limited. Young requested the respondent to guarantee the indebtedness of Four Square Lumber (Buildings) Ltd. The respondent refused to execute a guarantee.\nIn the spring of 1962, Four Square Lumber (Buildings) Ltd. decided to expand its business and was desirous of enjoying the same credit facilities with the appellant as they had in the past. The appellant, through its manager Young, indicated that such credit would be extended, if the respondent Cundy personally undertook to assume some responsibility for the Four Square Lumber (Buildings) Ltd. account. Cundy agreed to pay on or before August 11, 1962, the sum of $20,000 at the offices of the appellant in Calgary, the said payment to be credited to the account owing by Four Square Lumber (Buildings) Ltd. to the appellant, provided that the appellant extended the same credit facilities to Four Square Lumber (Buildings) Ltd. as it had done in the past. Accordingly, the foregoing agreement was executed. It is beyond question that the respondent Cundy assumed the liability of Four Square Lumber (Buildings) Ltd. to the extent of $20,000 and the appellant released Four Square Lumber (Buildings) Ltd. to the extent of the said amount. That constituted a novation (see Commercial Bank of Tasmania v. Jones[1]. The respondent became indebted to the appellant in the sum of $20,000. At that time the appellant could not have brought action against Four Square Lumber (Buildings) Ltd. for the $20,000. The account of Four Square Lumber (Buildings) Ltd. was actually credited with the payment of $20,000 as of the date of the agreement, leaving the sum of $2,322.92 owing by Four Square Lumber (Buildings) Ltd. to the appellant at that time.\nSo far the transaction appears as a simple one. However, the respondent alleges that the said agreement was subject to the condition precedent that the respondent would become liable for the $20,000 on August 11, 1962 only if the appellant continued to do business and to extend credit to Four Square Lumber (Buildings) Ltd. as had been done in the past and he relies on the paragraph of the agreement which reads:\nNOW THIS AGREEMENT WITNESSETH that in consideration of the covenants herein expressed and in particular in consideration of Weldwood continuing to do business with Four Square which will be to your direct advantage as Cundy being an officer and\/or shareholder thereof, it is mutually agreed between the parties hereto as follows:\u2014\nThe appellant did continue to do business with Four Square Lumber (Buildings) Ltd. and extended credit for such materials as were ordered by Four Square Lumber (Buildings) Ltd. during the balance of the month of May and throughout the month of June 1962, but on or about July 1,1962, the appellant refused to extent further credit to Four Square Lumber (Buildings) Ltd. At that time credit to the extent of some $7,600 had been extended. The reason credit was refused on and after July 1st was because three cheques of Four Square Lumber (Buildings) Ltd. for $500 each in the hands of the respondent had been dishonoured on being presented for payment during the last days of June 1962. These cheques came into being in the following circumstances. The respondent, having made himself liable to the appellant for the $20,000 which he undertook to pay on August 11, 1962, had Four Square Lumber (Buildings) Ltd. issue to him 40 $500 cheques post-dated four to five days apart. He endorsed and delivered them to the appellant. These cheques, if honoured on presentation, would have relieved him of the liability he had personally assumed, though in a much longer period than to August 11, 1962. In this manner the respondent was actually having Four Square Lumber (Buildings) Ltd. use its working capital to discharge the liability that he had assumed to the appellant and this in May and June 1962 which was a slack time for Four Square Lumber (Buildings) Ltd. Ten of these $500 cheques were honoured prior to the first of the three cheques being dishonoured. The appellant credited the respondent with the $5,000 thus received and after August 11, 1962, brought this action for the balance of $15,000. The respondent defended, alleging:\n6. The Defendant states that it was expressly understood and a condition precedent to the Agreement of the 11th day of May, A.D. 1962 that the Plaintiff would extend credit to Four Square Lumber (Buildings) Ltd. in the same manner as credit had previously been extended to Four Square (Alberta) Lumber Ltd. but that the Plaintiff repudiated the Agreement by calling off credit as agreed, thereby releasing the Defendant from any obligation to the Plaintiff.\n7. In the alternative, the Defendant states that the Plaintiff persuaded the Defendant to sign the Agreement dated the 11th of May, A.D. 1962 conditional upon the Plaintiff continuing to do business with and extend credit to Four Square Lumber (Buildings) Ltd. and as the Plaintiff failed to satisfy this condition the Plaintiff is now estopped from claiming against the Defendant, Cundy.\nThe appellant claims that it had the right to refuse to extend further credit when the three $500 cheques were dishonoured and were not taken care of.\nThe action was tried by Kirby J. in the Supreme Court of Alberta who held that the appellant was justified in refusing to continue to extend credit after the three cheques were dishonoured. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta reversed the trial judge on the basis that there had been an entire failure of consideration, thus relieving the respondent of his liability for the balance of the $20,000. The Appellate Division purported to follow Royal Bank of Canada v. Salvatori[2]. I am unable to see that this case assists the respondent. In it their Lordships of the Privy Council held that there was a total failure of consideration in that the bank failed to perform the covenant to continue to deal with the debtors, Antoni Brothers, and that the guarantor, Salvatori, had not received the whole of the consideration upon which his covenant was based. In my view, a case much more in point is Royal Bank of Canada v. Mills[3], where on a guarantee identical with the document in the Salvatori case the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta held that there was no such failure of consideration where the bank continued to carry on a normal banking business with the debtor after the guarantee had been given. In the present case business was carried on as usual after May 11th and credit was extended until it became apparent on the three cheques being dishonoured that Four Square Lumber (Buildings) Ltd. was finding it impossible to pay its liabilities as they became due. In my view the appellant was justified in withholding further credit in the situation as it then developed.\nI would allow the appeal with costs in this Court and in the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta and restore the judgment of Kirby J.\nSpence J.:\u2014I have had the opportunity of reading the reasons for judgment of my brother Hall and I agree with both his reasons and the conclusions set out thereunder.\nI desire, however, to add some comments in reference to two defences advanced by the respondent. Firstly, that there was no novation because the old debt was not extinguished. Certainly, the old debt was extinguished as to $20,000 thereof and therefore the defence must be that there could not be a novation of only part of the old debt. I have been unable to find any authority for that proposition and Re Abernethy-Lougheed Logging Company, Attorney-General for British Columbia v. Salter[4], cited by counsel for the respondent, is not in my view such an authority, as in that case the whole of the debt was subject to novation and the word \"complete\" used by Sloan J.A. at p. 326 had no reference to a purported novation of part of the debt. I have found that Williston in vol. 6 of the revised edition of his authoritative work on contracts, at p. 5241 states:\nNovation necessarily involves the immediate discharge of an old debt or duty, or part of it, and the creation of a new one.\nthereby implying that the novation may be of part only of the original debt. In my view, Hodgson v. Anderson[5], and Fairlie v. Denton and Barker[6], are authorities for that proposition. Secondly, the respondent urged as a defence that the appellant's covenant to contine to do business with Four Square Lumber (Buildings) Limited was a condition precedent to the respondent's covenant to pay to the appellant the sum of $20,000, and that the appellant in breach of that covenant failed to continue to do business with Four Square Lumber (Buildings) Limited and freed the respondent from his covenant.\nThis argument was successful in the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta. Macdonald J. A., giving judgment for the Court, said:\nIt is clear that the cheques given by the appellant Cundy were not substituted for his covenant in the agreement of May 11th, 1962. We are satisfied that such cheques were voluntary payments in advance of the due date of the covenant to pay.\nOn the evidence it seems clear to us that the appellant has not received the consideration, that is, the whole of the consideration, upon which his covenant is based as the respondent breached the agreement by refusing and thereby failing to continue to do business with Four Square Lumber (Buildings) Ltd.\nBy reason of that failure, the appellant is not bound to perform his covenant. See Royal Bank of Canada v. Salvatori [1928] 3 W.W.R. 501 at 509.\nOn the evidence we are satisfied that the appellant did not instruct the respondent to desist from supplying goods to Four Square Lumber (Buildings) Ltd.\nWe would allow the appeal with costs.\nI am in agreement with my brother Hall that Royal Bank of Canada v. Mills[7] is applicable to the situation. On the evidence, the appellant did continue thereafter to do business with Four Square Lumber (Buildings) Limited as before. As Harvey C.J. said in that case at p. 286:\nIts \u2026business \u2026was carried on after the guaranty exactly as \u2026before.\nAlthough it is true that the orders given by Four Square to the appellant in the months which followed the delivery to the appellant of the agreement of May 11, 1962 were much smaller than had been delivered previously, what caused the appellant to refuse to continue to do business further with Four Square was the fact that three cheques of the said Four Square company for $500 each made in favour of the respondent, and by him endorsed and delivered to the appellant, were dishonoured in the space of a few weeks. These cheques were delivered to the appellant by the respondent in the fashion and for the purpose set out by my brother Hall and in fact were prepayments, had they been honoured, of the respondent's convenant under the agreement. The appellant would not have been justified in refusing further to do business with Four Square because such cheques in prepayment had been dishonoured. But the appellant by the fact that such cheques, being cheques of the Four Square debts, were dishonoured had notice that that company was ceasing to do business and to pay its creditors in the ordinary fashion. The covenant to continue to do business cannot be interpreted as requiring the appellant to continue to supply credit to an insolvent purchaser. As Kirby J. said in his judgment at trial:\nIn my mind, it has just boiled down to that, and I would think that Weldwood-Westply would be very poor businessmen if they continued to do business.\nThere was, therefore, no breach of the condition precedent and the refusal under these circumstances of the appellant to continue to do business with Four Square Lumber (Buildings) Limited cannot be relied upon as a defence freeing the respondent from his covenant.\nFor these reasons, and those given by my brother Hall, I would allow the appeal with costs in this Court and in the Court of Appeal, and restore the judgment at trial.\nAppeal allowed with costs and judgment at trial restored.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Woolliams, Kerr, Korman & Moore, Calgary.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: MacDonald, Cheeseman, Moore & Atkinson, Calgary.\n[1] [1893] A.C. 313.\n[2] [1928] 3 W.W.R. 501.\n[3] [1932] 3 W.W.R. 283, 4 D.L.R. 574.\n[4] [1940] 1 W.W.R. 319.\n[5] (1825), 3 B & C. 842, 107 E.R. 945.\n[6] (1828), 8 B & C. 395, 108 E.R. 1089.\n[7] [1932] 3 W.W.R. 283.\n",

This action was defended by all defendants. After the completion of the work, the defendant instituted in the district of Saguenay an action against the original plaintiff for work done, materials furnished and damages. The original plaintiff filed a cross-demand in the second action for damages arising from the collapse of one of the warehouses built under the contract. The exception of lis pendens asking that the cross-demand be struck out was dismissed by the trial judge. This judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeal. The original plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nIt is clear that lis pendens exists only if in both actions the parties, the cause and the object of the action are the same. There is no doubt that in the present case there was identity of parties and of cause. There was also identity of object. The damages claimed in the Montreal action were identical in character to those claimed by the plaintiff in its cross-demand. The mere fact that the amounts claimed might differ did not alter the nature of the object. Under art. 215 of the Code of Civil Procedure, additional damages cannot be claimed in a different action, but by incidental demand.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec[1], reversing a judgment of Beaudoin J. Appeal dismissed.\nJohn J. Ahearn, Q.C., for the plaintiff, appellant.\nPeter Laing, Q.C., for the defendant, respondent. The judgment of the Court was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014I am of the opinion that this appeal fails and that it should be dismissed. A short r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the facts is essential for the better understanding of this case.\nIn 1958, the Cargill Grain Company, Limited, Cross-Plaintiff-Appellant, planned the construction, in Baie Comeau, District of Saguenay, Province of Quebec, of a grain export and storage elevator on the St. Lawrence River, with a capacity in excess of eleven million bushels of grain and high-speed loading and unloading facilities. The appellant entered into a series of separate contracts, each for a different phase of the work.\nThe Foundation Company of Canada, Limited, submitted bids which were the lowest, and was awarded on or about November 5, 1958, Contract No. 3, on March 17, 1959, Contract No. 4, and on July 23, 1959, Contract No. 14, for the execution of part of the work required.\nCargill Grain was dissatisfied with the work done by Foundation Company and on July 21, 1960, took action in the Superior Court of the District of Montreal against Foundation Company, Cross-Defendant-Respondent in the present case, and Davie Shipbuilding Limited, Cobra Industries Inc., and Hennessy Riedner & Associates Inc., who were all contractors on the Baie Comeau construction, jointly and severally for the sum of $2,451,586.60 damages and further against the Cross-Defendant-Respondent alone for the sum of $170,851.50. The conclusions of the action further asked that the invoiced claims of Cross-Defendant-Respondent against Cross-Plaintiff-Appellant in the amount of $1,096,119.65 be annulled. This action was contested by all defendants, including, of course, Foundation Company.\nThe Cargill Grain Company alleges that it has sustained damages as a result of the completion of the Baie Comeau facility beyond its scheduled completion date and that\n\u2026moneys obtained by Cross-Defendant-Respondent as a result of fraud, duress and mistake of fact and law; and payments made to other contractors to correct Cross-Defendant-Respondent's faulty work. In short, Cross-Plaintiff-Appellant claimed in its Montreal action that the facility was completed late and that Cargill was forced to pay excessive sums of money due to Cross-Defendant-Respondent\u2019s dishonesty and the necessity to correct certain bad work. After the institution of this action in Montreal, construction was completed in Baie Comeau, but during the first loading of grain on August 19, 1960, part of Warehouse No. 1 perished.\nOn December 20, 1960, the Foundation Company launched an action in the District of Saguenay to preserve its privilege, and claimed against Cargill Grain Company the sum of $964,774.88 for work done, material furnished in execution of its contracts, and damages. After contesting this action on the merits, and some two and one-half years later, in May 1963, the appellant asked leave in the Saguenay action to file a cross-demand, in which it claimed cost of reconstruction of Warehouse No. 1 and damages, totalling $1,986,216.10. The respondent, Foundation Company, met this cross-demand by a Preliminary Exception of Lis Pendens, which was dismissed by the Superior Court, but the judgment of the learned trial judge was reversed by the judgment of the Court of Appeal.[2]\nThe Exception reads as follows:\nWHEREAS by Writ of Summons issued out of the Superior Court for the District of Montreal under No. 511763 of the records of that Court, the Cross-Plaintiff has sued the Cross-Defendant for damages arising out of inter alia the alleged improper construction by Cross-Defendant of Warehouse No. 1 at Baie Comeau; and\nWHEREAS the said action is still pending between the parties; and\nWHEREAS the present Cross-Demand is between the same parties acting in the same qualities, has the same object and is founded on the same cause, as can be seen by a copy of the Writ and Declaration, Particulars and Further Particulars and, more particularly, paragraph 32(4) of the said Declaration, and the Particulars, and Further Particulars thereto, in the Montreal action aforesaid; copies of said Writ and Declaration, Particulars and Further Particulars, being filed herewith as Cross-Defendant's Exhibits CD-1, CD-2, and CD-3 respectively.\nTHAT Cross-Plaintiff's present Cross-Demand be dismissed with costs.\nUnder art. 173 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the defendant may, in case of lis pendens, ask, by a Preliminary Exception, that the action be dismissed. Here, what is asked is not that the action be dismissed, but that the cross-demand in the Murray Bay action be dismissed. It is clear that lis pendens exists only if in both cases (Montreal and Murray Bay) the parties, the cause and object of the case are the same. If these three conditions exist, the Exception must be allowed and the cross-demand of Cargill Grain claimed in the Murray Bay action must be dismissed.\nI have no doubt that in the present case there is identity of parties and of cause. I am also of the opinion that there is identity of object. The damages claimed by the Cargill Company in the Montreal action are identical in character to those claimed by the same company in its cross-demand in the Murray Bay action.\nThe amount may be different but the object remains the same. The mere fact that the amounts claimed in the two litigations may differ does not alter the nature of the object. Arsenault v. Monette[3] .\nThe rules that have to be applied in matters of lis pendens are the same that are to be applied in res judicata and they have to be applied here. These rules rest on the presumption of res judicata which is a bar to any further litigation on the same matter. This excludes the possibility of contradictory decisions on the same matter. Lacoste, de la chose jug\u00e9e, nos 14, 251; Langevin v. Raymond[4] .\nIn the case of Arsenault v. Monette, supra, the Court of Appeal said:\nAn exception of lis pendens should be maintained if it appears that the plaintiff took an action in the Magistrate's Court for damages to his automobile and that he instituted a second action in the Superior Court claiming a greater amount as damages resulting from the same accident. The issue whether an exception of lis pendens lies is governed by the principles of chose jug\u00e9e.\nLaurent, Droit civil vol. 20, p. 81 says:\nQuand la nouvelle demande est fond\u00e9e sur la m\u00eame cause, on peut la repousser par l'exception de chose jug\u00e9e, car elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e; si l'on admettait une nouvelle action, il pourrait y avoir contrari\u00e9t\u00e9 de d\u00e9cisions et, par suite, atteinte \u00e0 l'autorit\u00e9 que la loi attache aux jugements. Dans ce cas, on peut dire que le proc\u00e8s doit avoir une fin, car il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9, et on ne peut pas permettre que cette d\u00e9cision soit remise en question. Celui qui forme une nouvelle demande, fond\u00e9e sur la m\u00eame cause, n'a pas le droit de se plaindre si on le repousse par une fin de non-recevoir; il n'\u00e9prouve pas un d\u00e9ni de justice, car il a pu soutenir son droit, et il l'a soutenu devant le premier juge.\nIn the Montreal action, Cargill Grain claims in para. 6 of its statement of claim, damages for the improper construction of Warehouse No. 1, the foundation and preparation of the ground, causing the failure of the warehouse. This is an abstract of the particulars furnished by Cargill on January 3, 1962, following the action instituted in Montreal on July 21, 1960.\nIn defence to the action taken by Foundation Co. in 1963 Cargill made its cross-demand and alleged that the negligence and error of cross-defendant caused the perishing in part of Warehouse No. 1 on August 19, 1960.\nThe main claim by Cargill in its Montreal action appears to me to be the same as what is claimed in the Murray Bay action by the cross-demand. It should not be forgotten that a cross-demand is equivalent to an action. I have stated before that in such cases art. 173 applies and that the defendant may, in case of lis pendens, ask by a preliminary exception that the action be dismissed.\nIt is also trite law in the Province of Quebec that if additional damages have occurred since the first action was instituted, these additional damages cannot be claimed in a different action, or in a cross-demand in a different action, but by incidental demand by virtue of art. 215 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Under that section the plaintiff may, in the course of the suit, make such an incidental demand in order to claim a right accrued since the service of the principal action and connected with the right claimed originally.\nOn the whole, I concur with the reasons of Mr. Justice Rivard, and I would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs throughout.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nAttorneys for the plaintiff, appellants Hyde, Ahern, de Brabant & Nuss, Montreal.\nAttorneys for the defendant, respondent: Chisholm, Smith, Davis, Anglin, Laing, Weldon & Courtois, Montreal.\n[1] [1964] Quebec Q.B. 400.\n[2] [1964] Que.

The defendant conceded that it was guilty of infringement if the patent was found to be valid. The invention related to a removable sealing device for vehicle marking lights, which are used to outline trucks at night. The defendant contended that the invention was an obvious workshop improvement. The Exchequer Court held that the plaintiffs had a valid patent and that it had been infringed by the defendant. The latter appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe Exchequer Court was correct in finding that the claim of the letters patent had not been anticipated, that it defined an invention and that it was not an obvious workshop improvement.\nBrevets\u2014Contrefa\u00e7on\u2014Validit\u00e9 du brevet\u2014Anticipation\u2014Perfectionnement d'atelier\u2014Loi sur les Brevets, S.R.C. 1952, c. 203.\nLes demandeurs ont poursuivi le d\u00e9fendeur pour contrefa\u00e7on d'un brevet.

Appel rejet\u00e9. APPEAL from a judgment of No\u00ebl J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada[2], maintaining an action for infringement of a patent. Appeal dismissed.\nDonald F. Sim, Q.C., for the defendant, appellant.\nGordon W. Ford, Q.C., and David M. Rogers, for the plaintiffs, respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nHALL J.:\u2014This is an appeal by the appellant from the judgment of the Honourable Mr. Justice No\u00ebl in the Exchequer Court of Canada[3] dated October 23,1963, holding the respondents' Patent No. 522,093 to be valid and to have been infringed by the appellant.\nThe action was for infringement of a patent, issued on February 28, 1956, to Joseph H. DeFrees, now owned by the respondent Barbara B. DeFrees, and licensed exclusively to the respondent Betts Machine Company, a United States corporation with head office in Warren, Pennsylvania.\nThe only question in issue is the validity of the respondents' patent. The appellant concedes that it has infringed the patent if the patent if found to be valid.\nThe invention relates to a \"REMOVABLE SEALING DEVICE FOR VEHICLE MARKING LIGHT\". Vehicle marking lights are used primarily on tanker trucks that travel on a highway and indicate at night the bounds of the truck, its edges and corners so as to indicate to other drivers the limits of the vehicle for the purpose of avoiding accidents. Some of these lights are also used to show the height of the vehicle. The lights on the side of the trucks are termed \"coloured lights\" whereas those at the front and at the rear are called \"clearance lights\".\nThe patent in suit is described at length in the judgment under appeal, but in short the claim covers a vapour-proof vehicle lamp consisting of a cup-shaped housing, a slightly cupped lens and a means of securing the two together; the lens goes into the housing telescopically and the housing is shaped to accept that telescope. The sealing of both parts is effected by means of O-rings and two mating grooves, one on the housing and the other on the lens so that when they come together in the proper relationship they snap into position. When the grooves are in alignment and the O-ring is seated between them to effect a seal the flange on the outside of the lens abuts against the flange on the housing which is the snap seal effect.\nThe appellant argued that the judgment of No\u00ebl J. was erroneous in the following respects:\n1. In finding Canadian Letters Patent No. 522,093 valid.\n2. In finding that the claim of the said Letters Patent had not been anticipated.\n3. In finding that the claim of the said Letters Patent defined an invention and was not an obvious workshop improvement.\nThe learned trial judge fully reviewed all the prior art, and concluded by saying:\nThis exhaustive review of all the prior art enables me to say without hestitation that in none of the patents cited would the patentee in suit have found the solution that he solved by his patent and, consequently, the attack on the patent in suit on the basis of anticipation or lack of novelty must fail.\nHe then dealt fully with the matter of inventiveness or inventive ingenuity, and following an exhaustive review of the relevant law and of prior patents and devices, he rejected the claim that the device described in the patent was merely a workshop improvement and said:\nThere is, therefore, here, in my opinion, impressive evidence of inventiveness and of a want in the fuel tanker trade that remained unfulfilled until the DeFrees patent came along and, consequently, the defendant's attack on the patent in this respect must fail.\nHaving considered the evidence, the arguments of counsel and the authorities to which they referred, and having the advantage of the exhaustive review of both the prior art and on the question of inventiveness so fully gone into by the learned trial judge, I find myself wholly in agreement with his conclusions and reasons and I am content to adopt them.\nThe appeal must, therefore, be dismissed with costs and the judgment of No\u00ebl J. affirmed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: McCarthy & McCarthy, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, respondents: Rogers & Bereskin, Toronto.\n[1] [1964] Ex.

The Board also directed a contribution of 50 per cent of the cost from the Railway Grade Crossing Fund. The balance was to be paid by the Department of Roads. Contending that the Board had erred in determining the amount to be paid by it, the railway company obtained leave to appeal to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nSections 39 and 262 of the Railway Act give the Board very wide discretionary powers to order any construction, alterations, substitution or reconstruction of any railway crossing structure or subway and to apportion the cost of any such works between the railway company, municipal or other corporation or person.

It is within the jurisdiction of the Board under s. 39(2) of the Act to determine by whom and in what proportions the cost and expense of the construction should be borne.

Paradis, Q.C., for the appellant.\nJean Turgeon, Q.C., for the respondents.\nJ. J. Frawley, Q.C., for the intervenant.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nHALL J.:\u2014On June 22, 1962, the Minister of Roads of the Province of Quebec applied under s. 260 of the Railway Act to the Board of Transport Commissioners for Canada for an Order requiring the construction of an overhead bridge to replace an existing subway at mileage 100.54 Sherbrooke Sub-Division near the Village of South Stukely which had been constructed in 1908 pursuant to an Order of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada dated April 10, 1908, as No. 4593. Between the years 1908 and 1962 changes in the character and speed of highway traffic and size and number of highway vehicles had made the 1908 subway inadequate in dimensions and hazardous to modern highway traffic. The highway served by this subway had become Provincial Highway No. 1 between the Cities of Montreal and Sherbrooke. The new bridge over the railway line was to be built at mileage 100.36 and the subway at mileage 100.54 closed and the cost of closing the subway was to be included in the cost of construction of the overhead bridge at mileage 100.36.\nWith the consent of all parties and to enable the work to proceed, the Board of Transport Commissioners issued. Order No. 109763 dated December 7, 1962, authorizing the constructing of the bridge, directing a contribution of 50 per cent of the cost of the construction from the Railway Grade Crossing Fund, reserving for further consideration the question of further apportionment of the balance of the cost of construction and assessing the cost of maintenance of the new structure to the Department of Roads of the Province of Quebec. On May 5, 1964, the Board of Transport Commissioners held a public hearing in the City of Quebec to determine the question reserved under its Order No. 109763 as to apportionment of the remaining 50 per cent of the cost of construction. The Board, on June 18, 1964, by Order No. 114746, directed that of the balance remaining to be allocated after the contribution of 50 per cent previously directed to be paid from the Railway Grade Crossing Fund 25 per cent (or 12 1\/2 per cent of the total) should be paid by Canadian Pacific Railway Company and the remainder by the Department of Roads of the Province of Quebec. This meant a contribution of approximately $42,000 by Canadian Pacific Railway Company. The Railway company had maintained that it should not be assessed any amount exceeding $15,000 which amount it argued represented the value of the only benefit that the Railway company would receive from the reconstruction project. The Railway company applied under s. 53(2) of the Railway Act and was given leave to appeal to this Court upon the following question of law:\nDid the Board of Transport Commissioners, by its judgment of June 18, 1964, fail to exercise its discretion validly under section 262 of the Railway Act to determine the portion to be borne by the appellant of the cost of a highway bridge across the railway, when it acted on the view that section 267 of the Railway Act imposed upon the railway company an obligation to replace a subway constructed in 1908 with a structure such as to afford safe and adequate facilities for present-day highway traffic?\nSection 267 of the Railway Act reads as follows:\nEvery structure by which any railway is carried over or under any highway or by which any highway is carried over or under any railway, shall be so constructed, and, at all times, be so maintained, as to afford safe and adequate facilities for all traffic passing over, under or through such structure.\nThe contention of the Railway company before this Court was that the Board of Transport Commissioners erred in law in taking into consideration at all the provisions of s. 267 of the Railway Act and that, having given some weight to a continuing obligation on the part of the Railway company under s. 267 the Board had not properly or validly exercised the discretion which it had under s. 262 of the Railway Act to determine the portion to be borne by the appellant.\nThe question as framed by the appellant and the argument of counsel for the appellant would appear to suggest that the Board founded its judgment solely on s. 267. That such was not the case will be seen from the judgment of the Board which reads:\nIn trying to establish the value of its contribution, the Company makes the assumption that its obligation is limited to the maintenance or the replacement of the old structure. Yet, according to section 267 of the Railway Act, these structures \"shall be so constructed and at all times be so maintained as to afford safe and adequate facilities for all traffic passing over, under or through them.\"\nI believe that this can only be interpreted as meaning that the obligation of the Railway are related to the adequate facilities required, rather than to only the old structure, where it is no longer adequate for the traffic offering.\nIn the case of replacement of a level crossing by a grade separation, the Railway is asked to contribute on a percentage basis towards the cost of the grade separation. The Board has established a formula of apportionment of costs of construction whereby the Railway usually contributes 5 per cent, which has been generally accepted as representing the responsibility of the Railways with respect to such improvements. As the Board contributes 80 per cent of the cost of such works, the Railway's share is the equivalent of one-quarter of the remainder of the cost.\nI believe that the responsibility of the Railway is no less in respect of the replacement of a grade separation which is inadequate for present day traffic. The fact that the Railway Act limits the contribution from The Railway Grade Crossing Fund to 50 per cent of the cost of the new structure is no reason why the proportion to be paid by the Company should be less than one-quarter of the remainder, as is the case for new grade separations.\nI cannot agree with the position taken by the Company that its obligation to contribute towards the cost of grade separations to replace inadequate structures should be limited to the value of the improvement in its net financial position that would result from discontinuance of its commitments to maintain its existing structure. On the other hand, I consider that the suggestion of the Department that the Company should contribute 20 per cent of the cost of the structure is not well founded. There is no doubt that it will be difficult to assess, in dollars and cents, the value of the advantages that will accrue to the highway traffic as a result of \"this improvement. It is not difficult to see, however, that the benefits are greater to the highway than they are to the Railway.\nI consider that it is fair and reasonable in this case to require the Company to contribute one-quarter of the remainder of the cost of construction, after the 50 per cent grant from The Railway Grade Crossing Fund, or 12 1\/2 per cent of the total cost, the remainder to be paid by the Quebec Department of Roads.\nI am unable to see any error in law in the judgment of the Board in relation to s. 267.\nSections 39 and 262 of the Railway Act read as follows:\n39. (1) When the Board, in the exercise of any power vested in it, in and by any order directs or permits any structure, appliances, equipment, works, renewals or repairs to be provided, constructed, reconstructed, altered, installed, operated, used or maintained, it may, except as otherwise expressly provided, order by what company, municipality or person, interested or affected by such order, as the case may be, and when or within what time and upon what terms and conditions as to the payment of compensation or otherwise, and under what supervision, the same shall be provided, constructed, reconstructed, altered, installed, operated, used and maintained.\n(2) The Board may, except as otherwise expressly provided, order by whom, in what proportion, and when, the cost and expenses of providing, constructing, reconstructing, altering, installing and executing such structures, equipment, works, renewals, or repairs, or of the supervision, if any, or of the continued operation, use or maintenance thereof, or of otherwise complying with such order, shall be paid.\n262. Notwithstanding anything in this Act or any other Act, the Board may order what portion, if any, of the cost is to be borne respectively by the company, municipal or other corporation or person in respect of any order made by the Board under section 259, 260 or 261, and such order is binding on and enforceable against any railway company, municipal or other corporation or person named in such order.\nThese sections give the Board very wide discretionary powers to order any construction, alteration, substitution or reconstruction of any railway crossing structure or subway and to apportion the cost of any such works between the Railway Company, municipal or other corporation or person. The discretionary powers so exercised are not subject to review by this Court. It is within the jurisdiction of the Board under s. 39(2) to determine by whom and in what proportions the cost and expense of the construction should be borne: Toronto Transportation Comm. v. C.N.R.[1]\nThe appellant relied strongly on Sharpness New Docks and Gloucester and Birmingham Navigation Co. v. Attorney-General[2], and Attorney-General v. Great Northern Rail- way Co.1. These cases which were decided in the House of Lords in 1915 and 1916 were considered by the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada in City of Hamilton v. Canadian Pacific and Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway Companies2. Chief Commissioner Carvell there held that the principle followed in these two cases was not applicable to the situation in Canada where the jurisdiction and discretion of the Board were to be found in the provisions of the Railway Act. I am in agreement with this view and do not think that the two cases in question assist the appellant.\nThe appeal should accordingly be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: K.

Casey (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nAutomobiles Renault Canada Limited (Defendant) Respondent;\nand\nGeorge Coleman and Maurice Myrand (Defendants).\n1964: November 13, 16, 17, January 27; 1965: May 17.\nPresent: Cartwright, Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA\nMalicious prosecution\u2014Defendant laying information and withdrawing same at later date\u2014Nothing done during interval by magistrate before whom information sworn\u2014Whether a prosecution commenced so as to entitle plaintiff to claim against defendant for malicious prosecution.\nOne C, the general sales manager of the defendant company, was instructed to lay a charge of theft against the plaintiff. In the information it was stated that the informant had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the plaintiff did unlawfully steal twenty-six Renault Dauphine automobiles of a value exceeding fifty dollars, the property of the defendant company, contrary to the provisions of s. 280(a) of the Criminal Code. Following the laying of the information, on November 19, 1960, it remained in the office of the magistrate before whom it was sworn, and nothing further was done about it until December 13, when the magistrate received a letter, dated December 7, from C. In this letter C requested that the charge be withdrawn. The magistrate then wrote on the face of the information, \"Withdrawn Dec. 13\/60 at request of informant\".\nIn an action for damages for malicious prosecution, judgment was given in favour of the plaintiff. On appeal, this decision was reversed. The Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, in banco, allowed the appeal after hearing argument on only one of the points raised by the defendant company, namely, that, in law, the prosecution upon which the action was based was never instituted or commenced. From this judgment the plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Judson J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.\nPer Cartwright, Martland, Ritchie and Spence JJ.: The mere presentation of a false complaint would not necessarily be a basis for a suit for malicious prosecution, but, if a complaint was made which disclosed an offence with which the magistrate had jurisdiction to deal and he took cognizance of it, that was a sufficient foundation for the action.\nMohamed Amin v. Bannerjee, [1947] A.C. 322, followed.\nUnder s. 439 (1) of the Criminal Code, the magistrate could only receive the information provided it alleged those matters which would bring it within his jurisdiction, but, if it did, he was obligated to receive it. Having received the information, the magistrate was obliged to carry out the duties imposed upon him by s. 440(1) of the Code. In the present case, the magistrate received the information. It was obvious that he must have heard and considered the allegations made by the informant. He proceeded no further because the informant asked to withdraw the information. As in Mohamed Amin v. Bannerjee, supra, the essence of the matter here was the filing of an information to deal with which was within the magistrate's jurisdiction. At that point, in each case, the informant had done all he could do to launch criminal proceedings against the accused.\nAs the defendant had caused everything to be done which could be done unlawfully to set the law in motion against the plaintiff on a criminal charge, an action for malicious prosecution lay against the defendant, the other required elements of that tort having been established.\nYates v. The Queen (1885), 14 Q.B.D. 648; Thorpe v. Priestnall, [1897] 1 Q.B. 159, distinguished; Quartz Hill Consolidated Gold Mining Co. v. Eyre (1833), 11 Q.B.D. 674, referred to.\nPer Judson J., dissenting: For the reasons given by the Court below, the appeal should be dismissed.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, in banco[1], allowing an appeal from a judgment given by Coffin J., following a trial by jury, whereby damages were awarded to the plaintiff for malicious prosecution. Appeal allowed, Judson J. dissenting.\nJ.J. Robinette, Q.C., and L.O. Clarke, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nJ.H. Dickey, Q.C., and L.J. Hayes, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of Cartwright, Martland, Ritchie and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014This case is concerned with an action for damages for malicious prosecution brought by the appellant against the respondent. It was tried by a judge and jury. On the basis of the answers given by the jury to questions submitted by the learned trial judge, judgment was given in favour of the appellant awarding him damages in the amount of $28,000 and costs. On appeal, this decision was reversed. The Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, in banco, allowed the appeal after hearing argument on only one of the points raised by the defendant company, namely, that, in law, the prosecution upon which the action was based was never instituted or commenced.\nFrom this judgment the appellant has appealed to this Court. In argument before us the respondent submitted additional grounds upon which it was submitted the appellant's action ought to have been dismissed, and these points were fully argued.\nThe facts which gave rise to the action are as follows. Maritime Import Autos Limited (hereinafter referred to as \"Maritime\"), a Nova Scotia corporation, with its principal place of business in Amherst, in that province, was the distributor for the Maritime Provinces for the respondent, a Canadian corporation, with its head office in Montreal, which is engaged in the sale and distribution of Renault automobiles in Canada. The appellant resides at Amherst and is engaged in the automobile business. He organized various companies which distributed automobiles, including Maritime. At the times material to this action the appellant was the principal shareholder of Maritime, but was not an officer or director of that company.\nIn the spring of 1960 a meeting was held at Moncton by representatives of the respondent and of Maritime. The latter company was represented by the appellant, and by Mr. L. J. Kiley, its president, and Mr. T. A. Giles, its solicitor. At that meeting it was agreed that Maritime would store in Amherst some 120 Renault automobiles provided by the respondent, under a bailee agreement.\nThat agreement, which is dated June 2, 1960, acknowledges receipt from the respondent in good order and condition for storage at Maritime's premises in Amherst of a number of automobiles each individually described in the agreement.\nIt concluded with a paragraph reading:\nI\/we, as Bailee, agree (a) to hold and store safely the Chattels free of charge for the Company which is the sole and absolute owner thereof (b) on demand of the Company to promptly deliver the Chattels, or any of them as may be specified by the Company to it or to its order, and (c) that the Chattels are not in my\/our possession for purpose of sale and that I\/we have no authority to encumber sell, operate or in any way dispose the Chattels and (d) to have the cars insured against the risks of fire, theft and damages directly caused by person acting maliciously.\nUnder the heading \"Signature of Bailee\" appeared the signature \"L. J. Kiley\". Below his signature appeared the words \"Dealer Name\" and beneath that appeared the stamped name \"Maritime Import Autos Ltd. Amherst, N.S.\"\nGiles testified at the trial that :\nMaritime Import Autos were told that they could use the cars from the bailee stock provided they notified Montreal Head Office so that they could be invoiced for them. As a matter of fact, I know from my examination of the records of the company, Maritime Import Autos Limited, that cars were taken from the bailee stock, were reported to Montreal, and were paid for by the company prior to the 26 that were taken sometime in October.\nIt appears that, subsequent to the meeting in Moncton, three cars were removed from storage by Maritime and sold and an invoice was sent by the respondent to Maritime for these. Later, in October, a further 10 cars were removed and sold, and by letter dated October 7, 1960, Maritime requested the respondent to send invoices for the same. Following this, a further 26 cars were removed. Maritime was unable to pay for the cars which had been removed.\nMr. Giles was sent to Montreal in November 1960, armed with a cheque for $3,000 and instructed to discuss arrangements for payment of the balance owing by Maritime to the respondent. On November 16 he met with Mr. LeBouedec, the general manager of the respondent, and with other officers of that company. He was told that the respondent insisted on the appellant's personal guarantee of payment of the amount owing by Maritime.\nGiles testified that at this meeting LeBouedec said to him: \"This man Casey is nothing but a common thief and we are going to put him in his place.\" Giles replied to this by saying that the appellant knew nothing about the sale of the cars until after they were sold and that he was acting in good faith in trying to settle the matter.\nMr. Clement, the secretary-treasurer of the respondent, called as a witness for the defence, heard LeBouedec say that this was a technical theft committed by Casey.\nThis witness said that after Giles' departure, the meeting continued with LeBouedec and himself present and Mr. MacKay, the respondent's solicitor. They discussed the matter of payment for the 26 missing cars, and Clement said, in evidence:\nAnd, according to the discussion that had just happened with Mr. Giles, we had the impression that we will never get paid, and Mr. MacKay immediately suggested that an information be laid immediately against Mr. D. A. Casey.\nNeither LeBouedec nor MacKay gave evidence at the trial.\nFollowing this, George Coleman, the general sales manager of the respondent, was instructed to proceed to Amherst to lay a charge of theft against the appellant, which he did. He attended upon a stipendiary magistrate there, Mr. Alfred C. Milner. Apparently upon the basis of what Coleman told him the magistrate drafted the information, which was signed by Coleman and sworn before the magistrate. That information was as follows:\nCANADA\nPROVINCE OF NOVA SCOTIA\nMAGISTERIAL DISTRICT OF THE\nPROVINCE OF NOVA SCOTIA\nCOUNTY OF CUMBERLAND\nThis is the information and complaint of George F. Coleman of Montreal in the Province of Quebec, General Sales Manager, hereinafter called the Informant.\nThe informant says that he has reasonable and probable grounds to believe and does believe that D. A. Casey of Amherst in the County of Cumberland at or near Amherst in the County of Cumberland in the Magisterial District of the Province of Nova Scotia between the 8th day of October, A.D. 1960 and the 25th day of October, A.D. 1960, did unlawfully steal twenty-six Renault Dauphine automobiles of a value exceeding fifty dollars, the property of Automobiles Renault Canada Limited, contrary to the provisions of Section 280 (a) of the Criminal Code.\nSworn before me this 19th day of\nNovember, A.D. 1960, at Amherst in the\nCounty of Cumberland\n(Sgd.) Geo. F. Coleman\nInformant\n(Sgd.) Alfred C. Milner\nA Stipendiary Magistrate in and for the\nCounty of Cumberland.\nThe magistrate testified that he did not instruct Coleman to lay the information. Following the laying of the information, on November 19, 1960, it remained in his office, and nothing further was done about it until December 13, when the magistrate received a letter, dated December 7, from Coleman, reading as follows:\nI wish to inform you that it is my desire to withdraw the charge which was against D. A. Casey on November 19th, 1960.\nWhen the charge was laid, the evidence, on the basis of facts then known, appeared to be sufficient. However the information now available and the correspondence have been carefully reviewed and, on advice of counsel, it appears that at the present time there is insufficient evidence available to proceed with the complaint against Mr. Casey.\nI request therefore that the charge be withdrawn.\nThe magistrate then wrote, on the face of the information, \"Withdrawn Dec. 13\/60 at request of informant\".\nPrior to the withdrawal of the information, on November 23, Giles was visited by Mr. Myrand, the administrative secretary of the Toronto branch of the respondent. Giles' evidence as to his meeting with Myrand is as follows:\nI then asked him if he was authorized to act for Automobiles Renault Canada Limited in settling this problem over the payment for the cars. He said that he was. I asked him if he was in a position to withdraw the information if we would pay\u2014by \"we\" I mean Mr. Casey\u2014would pay them a certain number of dollars, and I said to him again \"If we will pay you X number of dollars\u201410\u2014$20,000.00, or thereabouts, you will withdraw the information?\" and he said \"Yes\". I then said to him, \"It is true, is it not, that the only reason you laid this information against Casey was to try and extract from him a certain amount of money?\" and his answer was \"Yes, just a little more pressure. Ha! Ha!\". I then asked him if he would confirm by telephone with Montreal that he was actually authorized to act. A phone call was put through to Montreal, and, as a result of the phone call, or following it, he again reiterated he was in a position to act and that if we would pay him for the cars, or a certain amount of money, and $20,000.00 was a figure that was used quite a lot, that he would then withdraw the information immediately. There was evidence that, following the laying of the information, the fact that the appellant had been charged with theft became widely known among people in the automobile business in Nova Scotia. Three witnesses testified that they had been advised that Casey had been charged with theft by persons employed by the respondent.\nThe learned trial judge submitted questions to the jury, in two series, the jury being charged in relation to the second set of questions after they had answered the first ones. The relevant questions and answers are as follows:\n(1) Did the Defendants during 1960 look to the Plaintiff, D. A. Casey, as the person with whom they dealt in matters of importance in their dealings with Maritime Import Autos Ltd.? \"No\".\n(2) Did the Defendants believe that Maritime Import Autos Ltd. had no right to sell any of the cars listed in the Bailee Receipt? \"No\".\n(1) Was there a prosecution of the Plaintiff, Douglas A. Casey, by the Defendants? \"Yes\".\n(2)(a) Did the Defendant, Automobile Renault (Canada) Ltd., act maliciously? \"Yes\".\n(3) What damages did the Plaintiff, Douglas A. Casey, suffer?\n\"Twenty-eight thousand dollars ($28,000.00)\".\nOn the basis of the answers given to the first series of questions the learned trial judge found that there was not reasonable and probable cause for the prosecution. On the basis of the answers given to the second series of questions he gave judgment in favour of the appellant.\nI have not reviewed the evidence in great detail, and have set out mainly the evidence which was favourable to the appellant. The reason for this is that, apart from the main issue of law on which the appeal was allowed by the Court below, nearly all of the points urged by the respondent were on the basis of there being no evidence to support the findings of the jury. On the issue of law dealt with in the reasons below, there is no conflict as to the evidence.\nIn my opinion there was evidence upon which the jury could give the answers which it made to the questions put to it, and, on the basis of the first two answers given, the learned trial judge properly found lack of reasonable and probable cause for the laying of the information.\nThe instruction given to the jury by the learned trial judge regarding the respondent's contention that the respondent had acted on the advice of counsel in laying the charge and that this was strong evidence that it did not act maliciously, was sufficient. As has already been pointed out, the respondent's officer chiefly responsible in the matter of laying the information, LeBouedec, and the solicitor who was consulted, MacKay, did not give evidence.\nI would not be prepared, in the circumstances of this case, to interfere with the jury's assessment of damages.\nIt was not contended before us that there had been no termination of the proceedings in favour of the appellant. In this connection we were referred to the proposition stated in Salmond on Torts, 13th ed., p. 726:\nIf the prosecution has actually determined in any manner in favour of the plaintiff it matters nothing in what way this has taken place. There need not have been any acquittal on the merits. What the plaintiff requires for his action is not a judicial determination of his innocence but merely the absence of any judicial determination of his guilt. Thus it is enough if the prosecution has been discontinued, or if the accused has been acquitted by reason of some formal defect in the indictment, or if a conviction has been quashed, even if for some technical defect in the proceedings.\nThe important issue of law raised in this appeal is that which was decided in the respondent's favour in the Court below, as to whether a prosecution had been commenced against the appellant so as to entitle him to claim against the respondent for malicious prosecution.\nThe question thus raised is a difficult one. There is certainly authority in support of the position taken by the Court below, which is well summarized in para. 654 of vol. III of Restatement of the Law of Torts promulgated by the American Law Institute. That paragraph states, in relation to the tort of wrongful prosecution, that criminal proceedings are instituted when\nprocess is issued for the purpose of bringing the person accused of a criminal offense before an official or tribunal whose function is to determine whether the accused\n(i) shall be held for later determination of his guilt or innocence, or\n(ii) is guilty of the offense charged.\nMacDonald J. in the Court below quotes an excerpt from Stephen on Malicious Prosecution (published in 1888), at p. 5:\nIn order to be liable to an action for malicious prosecution a defendant must have prosecuted the plaintiff, and it therefore becomes necessary to determine what constitutes a prosecution.\nThe only definition which, so far as I know, has been explicitly suggested, is that given by Mr. Justice Lopes in Danby v. Beardsley, 43 L.T. 603 (1881):\u2014\"\u2026this might be a definition of a prosecutor\u2014a man actively instrumental in putting the criminal law in force.\" (This, however, requires to be qualified by the observation, that not merely the ministerial but the judicial functions of the criminal law must be put in motion, that is, some judicial officer must be made to act in his judicial capacity.)\nI feel, however, that the starting point in considering this issue must be the leading case of Mohamed Amin v. Bannerjee[2], a decision of the Privy Council, on appeal from the High Court of Calcutta. In that case the respondents, who had been involved in a dispute of a civil character with the appellant, caused a petition of complaint to be filed against the appellant in a Police Magistrate's Court, which was registered as a charge of cheating under s. 420 of the Indian Penal Code. The magistrate, having taken cognizance of the case, subsequently held an inquiry, in open court, pursuant to s. 202 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, of which notice was given to the appellant, who attended and who was represented by counsel. After completion of the inquiry, the magistrate dismissed the complaint under s. 203 of that Code.\nThe relevant sections of the Code of Criminal Procedure provided as follows:\nSection 200. A Magistrate taking cognizance of an offence on complaint shall at once examine the complainant upon oath, and the substance of the examination shall be reduced to writing and shall be signed by the complainant, and also by the magistrate:\nSection 202. (1.) Any Magistrate, on receipt of a complaint of an offence of which he is authorized to take cognizance, or which has been transferred to him under s. 192, may, if he thinks fit, for reasons to be recorded in writing, postpone the issue of process for compelling the attendance of the person complained against, and either inquire into the case himself or, if he is a Magistrate other than a Magistrate of the third class, direct an inquiry or investigation to be made by any Magistrate subordinate to him, or by a police-officer, or by such other person as he thinks fit, for the purpose of ascertaining the truth or falsehood of the complaint:\nProvided that, save where the complaint has been made by a court, no such direction shall be made unless the complainant has been examined on oath under the provisions of s. 200.\n(2a.) Any Magistrate inquiring into a case under this section may, if he thinks fit, take evidence of witnesses on oath.\nSection 203. The Magistrate before whom a complaint is made or to whom it has been transferred, may dismiss the complaint, if, after considering the statement on oath (if any) of the complainant and the result of the investigation or inquiry (if any) under s. 202, there is in his judgment no sufficient ground for proceeding. In such case he shall briefly record his reasons for so doing. These sections were contained in Chapter 16, headed \"Of complaints to Magistrates\". Chapter 17, which followed, was headed \"Of the commencement of Proceedings before Magistrates\" and laid down the procedure when the magistrate decided to issue process on the complaint.\nThe appellant sued for damages for malicious prosecution. The respondents contended that the stage of prosecution had not been reached, and that it would not be reached until the magistrate said he was satisfied that there was a prima facie case and that a summons would issue for the attendance of the accused. They relied upon Yates v. The Queen[3].\nThe appeal was allowed by the Privy Council, holding that the proceedings had reached a stage sufficient to found an action for malicious prosecution.\nIn the judgment, there were reviewed two conflicting lines of authority, one of which commenced with the case of Golap Jan v. Bholanath Khettry[4], in which, in an action for malicious prosecution, it appeared that a complaint before a magistrate had been referred by him to the police for inquiry, and had been dismissed by the magistrate following receipt of the police report. It was held that no prosecution had been commenced and that the action failed. Reliance was placed on Yates v. The Queen, supra. The other line of authority included the case of Bishun Persad Narain Singh v. Phulman Singh[5], which stated the proposition that the prosecution commenced when the prosecutor had taken the initial step; namely, making the complaint to the magistrate.\nThe judgment then proceeds as follows:\nThe action for damages for malicious prosecution is part of the common law of England, administered by the High Court at Calcutta under its letters patent. The foundation of the action lies in abuse of the process of the court by wrongfully setting the law in motion, and it is designed to discourage the perversion of the machinery of justice for an improper purpose. The plaintiff must prove that the proceedings instituted against him were malicious, without reasonable and probable cause, that they terminated in his favour (if that be possible), and that he has suffered damage. As long ago as 1698 it was held by Holt C.J. in Savile v. Roberts, (1698) 1 Ld. Raym. 374, that damages might be claimed in an action under three heads, (1.) damage to the person, (2.) damage to property, and (3.) damage to reputation, and that rule has prevailed ever since. That the word \"prosecution\" in the title of the action is not used in the technical sense which it bears in criminal law is shown by the fact that the action lies for the malicious prosecution of certain classes of civil proceedings, for instance, falsely and maliciously presenting a petition in bankruptcy or a petition to wind up a company (Quartz Hill Consolidated Gold Mining Co. v. Eyre, (1883) 11 Q.B.D. 674). The reason why the action does not lie for falsely and maliciously prosecuting an ordinary civil action is, as explained by Bowen L.J. in the last mentioned case, that such a case does not necessarily and naturally involve damage to the party sued. A civil action which is false will be dismissed at the hearing. The defendant's reputation will be cleared of any imputations made against him, and he will be indemnified against his expenses by the award of costs against his opponent. The law does not award damages for mental anxiety, or for extra costs incurred beyond those imposed on the unsuccessful party. But a criminal charge involving scandal to reputation or the possible loss of life or liberty to the party charged does necessarily and naturally involve damage, and in such a case damage to reputation will be presumed.\nFrom this consideration of the nature of an action for damages for malicious prosecution emerges the answer to the problem before the Board. To found an action for damages for malicious prosecution based on criminal proceedings the test is not whether the criminal proceedings have reached a stage at which they may be correctly described as a prosecution; the test is whether such proceedings have reached a stage at which damage to the plaintiff results. Their Lordships are not prepared to go as far as some of the courts in India in saying that the mere presentation of a false complaint which first seeks to set the criminal law in motion will per se found an action for damages for malicious prosecution. If the magistrate dismisses the complaint as disclosing no offence with which he can deal, it may well be that there has been nothing but an unsuccessful attempt to set the criminal law in motion, and no damage to the plaintiff results. But in this case the magistrate took cognizance of the complaint, examined the complainant on oath, held an inquiry in open court under s. 202 which the plaintiff attended, and at which, as the learned judge has found, he incurred costs in defending himself. The plaint alleged the institution of criminal proceedings of a character necessarily involving damage to reputation and gave particulars of special damage alleged to have been suffered by the plaintiff. Their Lordships think that the action was well founded, and on the findings at the trial the plaintiff is entitled to judgment.\nBefore dealing with the effect of this judgment, MacDonald J., in the Court below, made reference to Yates v. The Queen, supra, and, in particular, the following extracts from the judgments in that case:\nFor my own part I consider that laying the information before the magistrate would not be the commencement of the prosecution, because the magistrate might refuse to grant a summons, and if no summons, how could it be said that a prosecution against any one ever commenced? (Per Brett M.R., at p. 657.)\nOn behalf of the plaintiff in error it has been said that the first application for the rule nisi is such commencement, but how can it be said that a prosecution is commenced before a person is summoned to answer a complaint. (Per Cotton LJ. at p. 661.) However, as is pointed out in the Mohamed Amin case, Yates v. The Queen was not concerned with an action for malicious prosecution, but with the question as to whether the fiat of the Director of Public Prosecutions was required before commencing a prosecution by information for libel in a newspaper by virtue of s. 3 of the Newspaper Libel and Registration Act, 1881.\nReference was then made to, and considerable reliance placed upon, Thorpe v. Priestnall[6], and, in particular, a passage from the judgment of Wills J., at p. 162. I quote from the reasons for judgment of MacDonald J., including his quotation from that case. The insertion of the capital letters and of the italics was made by MacDonald J., for greater ease of reference.\n(A) On looking at the words of the (Statute) it is clear that the institution of a prosecution is something which may be done by the chief constable as well as with his consent. The chief constable cannot grant a summons, nor when a summons is once granted has he any discretion to exercise as to whether it shall be served or not. Neither of those things, therefore, is the institution of the prosecution, which is a matter within his discretion. The institution of the prosecution must, therefore, be the laying of the information \u2026 (B) The passages in the judgment in Yates v. Reg., supra, only amount to dicta, \u2026 (C) It may be that the magistrate does not act upon the information, and in that case no prosecution follows, and there is nothing to which the phrase \"commencement of a prosecution\" is applicable. (D) But where there is a prosecution, I cannot see any reason why the laying of the information (which started it) is not the commencement of the prosecution; and I certainly think this has been the meaning of the phrase commonly accepted in the profession.\nConcerning these passages four points are important in this case. Passage (A) holds that for the purposes of the statute in question the laying of the information was the institution of the prosecution which resulted in the conviction; for the reason specified in passage (D). As to passage (B), it is to be noted that though the passages quoted earlier from Yates v. Reg. are referred to correctly as amounting only to dicta, they do form the substance of proposition (C) relating to a case which stopped at the information stage (as did the case before us); and that a distinctly different proposition (D) was enunciated as to the commencement of a prosecution which continued beyond that stage, as it had in the case itself.\nIt would appear, therefore, that many of the decisions, relating to limitation and other statutes, have been in error in the uncritical acceptance of Thorpe v. Priestnall as implying that in all cases the institution of a prosecution is to be equated with the laying of the information, whereas cases in which nothing followed from that bare fact are to be excepted from that broad proposition. In my view the distinction drawn therein is one upon which this case may well turn. That distinction is (D) that when there has been a prosecution (beyond the information) the laying of the information, which started that prosecution, is to be held to be \"the commencement of the prosecution\" and that this is the meaning commonly accepted by the profession as to this most common situation; but (C), if the magistrate does not act upon the information there has been no such commencement.\nAgain it is pertinent to observe that this case was not concerned with an action for malicious prosecution. The question in issue was as to when a prosecution had been instituted within the meaning of the Sunday Observance Prosecution Act, 1871, which provided that no prosecution should be instituted for any offence under the Sunday Observance Act, 1676, except with the written consent of the chief officer of police of the police district in which the offence was committed. The appellant had been convicted under the Sunday Observance Act, but the written consent had not been given until after the information was laid. The case held that the prosecution was instituted when the information was laid and therefore the conviction was bad. The argument in support of the conviction relied upon Yates v. The Queen.\nWith great respect, I cannot regard the passages from the judgment of Wills J., marked by MacDonald J. as (C) and (D), as being anything more than an attempt to reconcile the dicta in the Yates case with the conclusion he himself had reached on the issue involved in the case before him. Both cases involved the interpretation of specific statutes, and the judgments were not directed to the point in issue here.\nMacDonald J. suggests that the Privy Council, in Mohamed Amin, inferentially adopted passage (C) from the judgment of Wills J. when it was said:\nTheir Lordships are not prepared to go as far as some of the courts in India in saying that the mere presentation of a false complaint which first seeks to set the criminal law in motion will per se found an action for damages for malicious prosecution.\nWith respect, I do not agree that this is so. In Mohamed Amin the complaint was dismissed by the magistrate, and no prosecution followed the making of the complaint. It is true that the magistrate made an inquiry under s. 202 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, but the result of that was the dismissal of the complaint. No process was ever issued to bring the accused before the magistrate. I think it is important to read the passage from the Privy Council, just quoted, together with the sentence which immediately follows it:\nIf the magistrate dismisses the complaint as disclosing no offence with which he can deal, it may well be that there has been nothing but an unsuccessful attempt to set the criminal law in motion, and no damage to the plaintiff results.\n(The italics are mine.)\nRead together, they would appear to mean that the mere presentation of a false complaint will not necessarily be a basis for a suit for malicious prosecution, but that, if a complaint is made disclosing an offence with which the magistrate has jurisdiction to deal and he takes cognizance of it, that is a sufficient foundation for the action.\nI turn now to consider s. 439(1) of the Criminal Code. It provides as follows:\n439.(1) Any one who, upon reasonable and probable grounds, believes that a person has committed an indictable offence may lay an information in writing and under oath before a justice, and the justice shall receive the information where it is alleged that\n(a) the person has committed, anywhere, an indictable offence that may be tried in the province in which the justice resides, and that the person\n(i) is or is believed to be, or\n(ii) resides or is believed to reside, within the territorial jurisdiction of the justice;\n(b) the person, wherever he may be, has committed an indictable offence within the territorial jurisdiction of the justice;\n(c) the person has anywhere unlawfully received property that was unlawfully obtained within the territorial jurisdiction of the justice; or\n(d) the person has in his possession stolen property within the territorial jurisdiction of the justice.\nThe magistrate could only receive the information provided it alleged those matters which would bring it within his jurisdiction, but, if it did, he was obligated to receive it.\nHaving received the information, the magistrate is obliged to carry out the duties imposed upon him by s. 440(1) of the Code:\n440.(1) A justice who receives an information shall\n(a) hear and consider, ex parte,\n(i) the allegations of the informant, and\n(ii) the evidence of witnesses, where he considers it desirable or necessary to do so; and\n(b) issue, where he considers that a case for so doing is made out, a summons or warrant, as the case may be, to compel the accused to attend before him. In the present case, the magistrate received the information. He obviously must have heard and considered the allegations which had been made by Coleman. According to his own evidence, he had not taken any further steps before he received the letter which requested the withdrawal of the information, following which he made a notation upon the information to the effect that it had been withdrawn at the request of the informant. It is clear that he had not taken any further steps thereafter because of the request made in the informant's letter asking for such withdrawal.\nIn Mohamed Amin, the magistrate postponed the issue of process until he had made an inquiry, following which he dismissed the complaint. MacDonald J. distinguishes the Mohamed Amin case from the present one on the basis that, in the former, the magistrate had performed a judicial function, comparable to what would have occurred, in the present case, if the magistrate had elected to hear evidence under s. 440(1) (a) (ii), but it is significant that the inquiry to be conducted under s. 202 of the Code of Criminal Procedure could, on the direction of the magistrate, have been made by a police officer.\nWith respect, though recognizing the factual difference between the two cases, I do not see any valid distinction in principle. In neither case did the matter proceed to the stage of issuing process to compel the attendance of the accused. In the one case, the matter stopped before that point because the magistrate, after an inquiry as to the truth or falsehood of the complaint, dismissed it. In the other, if he was fulfilling his duty, which in the absence of evidence to the contrary we must assume he did, the magistrate considered the allegations of the informant, and proceeded no further, not because he considered no case had been made out, but because the informant asked to withdraw the information.\nIn my opinion, the essence of the matter, in each case, was the filing of an information to deal with which was within the magistrate's jurisdiction. At that point, in each case, the informant had done all he could do to launch criminal proceedings against the accused.\nI do not interpret the Mohamed Amin case as authority for the proposition that a case of malicious prosecution can never be founded on the laying of an information, but rather as establishing that the information must be one which discloses an offense with which the magistrate can deal. The essence of the matter, in that case, was not that the magistrate acted \"judicially\" by conducting an inquiry, but that, on the evidence, the magistrate had taken cognizance of the complaint. The proceedings in the present case had progressed just as far, so far as the accused was concerned, as they had in the case of Mohamed Amin.\nI find support for the view which I have taken in the case of Quartz Hill Consolidated Gold Mining Company v. Eyre[7], which is referred to in the judgment in Mohamed Amin, but which was not discussed in the Court below. The issue in that case was as to whether the presentation, falsely and maliciously, of a petition to wind up a trading company would justify an action for damages by the company. The Court of Appeal held that it would. In that case, the petition had been presented, and the required advertising done, but it had never been served upon the company prior to its withdrawal by the petitioner. One of the judgments is written by Brett, M.R., who sat in the Yates case, two years later.\nIt is true that, in determining whether the proceedings instituted by the petitioner were akin to ordinary civil proceedings (in respect of which, though malicious, no action would lie) or to a bankruptcy petition, stress was laid upon the publicity attendant upon the petition because of the requirement of public advertising before the petition was heard. This, however, only went to the issue of whether an action would lie at all in relation to malicious proceedings for winding up. The important feature of the case is that it was the institution of proceedings which were never served which gave rise to the action.\nThe real principle involved in the case was stated by Bowen L.J., at p. 692:\nIn the present instance we have to consider whether a petition to wind up a company falls upon the one side of the line or the other\u2014whether, as the Master of the Rolls has said, it is more like an action which does not necessarily involve damage, and therefore will not, however maliciously and wrongfully brought, justify an action for malicious prosecution, or whether it is more like a bankruptcy petition. I do not see how a petition to wind up a company can be presented and advertised in the newspapers without striking a blow at its credit. I suppose that most of the lawyers of the present day have seen a great increase of three kinds of abuses, all of which are indulged in for the purpose of extorting the payment of some debt, which ought to be the subject of some civil redress. There is the abuse of the police courts when their process is used to extort money; there is the abuse of the bankruptcy law; and there is the abuse of the provisions in the Companies Act, 1862, for winding up companies. In all these three forms of abuse the aim is to wreck credit, and I should be sorry to think that since they all involve a blow at the credit of those against whom they are instituted, the law did not afterwards place in the hands of the injured and aggrieved persons who have been wrongfully assailed, a means of righting themselves and recouping themselves, as far as can be, for the mischief done to them.\nThat publicity attended the laying of the information in this case is clear. The evidence established that employees of the respondent were not only aware of it, but passed the information on to others.\nI am therefore of the opinion, with great respect to the views expressed in the Court below, that, as the respondent had caused everything to be done which could be done wrongfully to set the law in motion against the appellant on a criminal charge, an action for malicious prosecution lay against the respondent, the other required elements of that tort being established.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be allowed and the judgment at trial restored, with costs to the appellant in this Court and in the Court below.\nJUDSON J. (dissenting):\u2014I would dismiss this appeal. I agree completely with the reasons delivered by the Nova Scotia Supreme Court, in banco[8].\nAppeal allowed, judgment at trial restored, with costs, Judson J. dissenting.\nSolicitor for the plaintiff, appellant: L.

The defendant paid $6,600 for the land and spent over $25,000 in building a house. The plaintiffs, as adjoining owners, instituted an action to set aside the sale and to quash the by-law purporting to approve it. The action was dismissed by the trial judge. This judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeal which declared that the by-law was invalid and that the transfer to the defendant should be set aside. The defendants appealed to this Court. The plaintiffs moved to quash on the ground that the amount of the matter in controversy in the appeal did not exceed $10,000 and that consequently there was no appeal under s. 36 of the Supreme Court Act.\nHeld: The motion to quash should be dismissed.\nThe amount or value of the matter in controversy in an appeal is the loss which the appellant will suffer if the judgment in appeal is upheld. In the present case the validity of the by-law was not all that was involved in this appeal, since the judgment under appeal deprived the defendants of their title. Consequently, if the appeal fails the defendants will have no title to a property on which they have expended over $30,000.\nAppels\u2014Juridiction\u2014Proc\u00e9dure\u2014Appel \u00e0 la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada\u2014Montant en litige\u2014Fermeture d'un chemin par une municipalit\u00e9\u2014Terrain non mis \u00e0 la disposition des propri\u00e9taires contigus\u2014Terrain vendu \u00e0 un pr\u00eate-nom d'un conseiller municipal\u2014Terrain acquis et construit par le conseiller\u2014Demande pour faire rejeter l'appel\u2014Loi sur la Cour supr\u00eame, S.R.C. 1952, c. 259, art. 36.

Diplock, Q.C., for the Township.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This is a motion to quash the appeal on the ground that the amount or value of the matter in controversy in the appeal does not exceed $10,000 and that consequently no appeal lies under s. 36 of the Supreme Court Act.\nThe action commenced by the respondents Hazel Doreen Reid and John Caird Reid arises out of the following facts. The respondents were the owners of a property which was bounded on one side by Myra Road in the Township of York. The Township decided to close the road and under the terms of the Municipal Act on doing so was under an obligation to give to the owners of the properties adjoining the closed road the right to purchase the same. Instead of offering the property as required the Township sold it to a pr\u00eate-nom of the appellant Christopher Tonks who is the Reeve of the Township. Tonks paid $6,600 for the land and has since spent over $25,000 in building a house on it.\nThe prayer for relief in the statement of claim asks inter alia:\n(a) a mandamus requiring the council of the defendant Corporation to fix the price at which the lands described in paragraph 5 hereof are to be sold, which lands comprised a highway which was legally stopped-up;\n(b) a declaration that the plaintiff Hazel Doreen Reid as the owner of the land which abuts on the lands therein described has the right to purchase the soil and freehold of the lands therein described for the sum of $6,600.00 or at the price fixed as aforesaid or, in the alternative of the Westerly half of the said lands for the sum of $3,300.00 or at one-half of the price fixed as aforesaid;\n(c) an order quashing section 2 of by-law number 15649 purported to have been passed by the Council of the defendant Corporation on the ground that the same is ultra vires and in contravention of the provisions of Sections 36 and 477 of the Municipal Act being Revised Statutes of Ontario 1960, Chapter 249 and setting aside all and any deeds executed or delivered or purported so to be by the defendant Corporation in pursuance thereof;\n(d) an order setting aside the purported sale of the lands described in paragraph 5 hereof and any by-law insofar as it purports to approve, ratify and confirm such purported sale of the lands described in paragraph 5 hereof and the authorization of the execution and delivery by the reeve and clerk of the defendant Corporation of a deed purporting to convey the lands therein described to the said Marie Eunice Froman;\n(e) an order setting aside and declaring null and void the deed from Mary Eunice Froman to the defendants Christopher A. Tonks and Anna Tonks;\nThe action was defended by the Tonks and by the Township who asked that it be dismissed with costs. The action was tried by King J. without a jury and was dismissed without costs. On appeal to the Court of Appeal the appeal was allowed and it was declared that the by-law of the Township in so far as it approved the sale of the land in question is invalid and should be set aside and that the deed to the pr\u00eate-nom of the Tonks and the deed from such pr\u00eate-nom to the Tonks are null and void and should be set aside.\nThe appeal seeks to restore the judgment at the trial. If the appeal succeeds the result will be that the Tonks are the owners of the land and the building upon it. If the appeal fails the result is that they have no title to this land. It seems to me that under these circumstances the amount in controversy in the appeal is the value of the land and building which exceeds $30,000.\nIt is said on behalf of the respondents that all that is really involved is the validity of the by-law but I cannot accept this argument. The judgment in appeal expressly declares the conveyance to the Tonks void and deprives them of their title.\nIt was submitted on behalf of the respondents that although the appellants are deprived of their title they would have a right to claim a lien on the lands for the money they have expended. Even if this were so I doubt whether it would be relevant; but it seems clear that if the judgment of the Court of Appeal stands the Tonks would have no such right. The judgment proceeds on the basis that Tonks was acting fraudulently throughout and if that be so he could not be said to have been acting under a bona fide mistake of title when he made the improvements.\nSince the case of Orpen v. Roberts[1], it has been settled that the amount or value of the matter in controversy is the loss which the appellant will suffer if the judgment in appeal is up-held\u2014see Fallis v. United Fuel Investments Limited[2], where it was said in the unanimous judgment of the Court:\nIn my opinion the test to be applied in determining whether there is an amount involved in the proposed appeal exceeding $2000 is that set out in the judgment of this Court in Orpen v. Roberts et al, upholding the judgment of the Registrar affrming jurisdiction. The action was for an injunction to restrain the defendant from erecting a building nearer to the street line than 25 feet and to restrain the municipality from granting a permit for the erection of the proposed building. The report at page 367 reads as follows:\nThe Court said the subject matter of the appeal is the right of the respondent to build on the street line on Carlton street in the city of Toronto. \"The amount or value of the matter in controversy\" (section 40) is the loss which the granting or refusal of that right would entail. The evidence sufficiently shows that the loss\u2014and therefore the amount or value in controversy\u2014exceeds $2,000.\nApplying this test to the facts of the case at bar, the evidence shows that if the winding-up proceeds the appellant Fallis will suffer a loss greatly in excess of $2000. In the case at bar if the appeal fails the appellants will have lost a property on which they have expended over $30,000, of which property under the judgment at the trial they were held to be the owners.\nI would dismiss the motion with costs.\nApplication dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendants, appellants: Smart & Biggar, Ottawa.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, respondents: Gowling, Mac-Tavish, Osborne & Henderson, Ottawa.\nSolicitors for the Township of York: Honeywell, Baker, Gibson, Witherspoon, Lawrence & Diplock, Ottawa.\n[1] [1925] S.C.R. 364, 1 D.L.R. 1101.\n[2] [1962] S.C.R. 771 at 774, 34 D.L.R.

The testator disposed of three parcels of real estate. He devised a cottage property absolutely to his daughter. No question of dower was raised in connection with this devise. The wife was given the right to continue to reside in the testator's house as long as she wished, and also $150 per month from the residue of the estate during her lifetime with the proviso that if she did not wish to continue in occupation of the house, and so notified the trustees in writing, she was to have an additional $150 per month. It was held, and there was no appeal on the point, that the right to reside in the house was a devise of a life estate. Consequently no question of dower arose with respect to this disposition. The third parcel of real estate was an apartment building which contained eight suites.\nThe trustees were given powers to postpone conversion or sale and to retain the estate in the form in which it stood at the date of death. The balance of the income and the whole of the residue were to go to the daughter. The widow claimed dower in the apartment building in addition to the interest given to her by the will.\nHeld (Spence J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Cartwright, Abbott, Judson and Hall JJ.: In order to raise a case for election under a will, there must be on the face of the will a disposition by the testator of something belonging to a person who takes an interest under the will. This means that where dower is involved, unless the widow is expressly put to her election, it must be found from the will itself and not from parol evidence that the testator intended to dispose of his property in a manner inconsistent with the widow's right to dower.\nAn implied power to lease was given in the will. However, the cases where a widow must elect because of the power to lease all involved express powers. Parker v. Sowerby (1854), 4 De G. M. & G. 321; Patrick v. Shaver (1874), 21 Gr. 123; Re Hunter, Hunter v. Hunter (1904), 3 O.W.R. 141, referred to. But this principle did not extend to implied powers. Laidlaw v. Jackes (1878), 25 Gr. 293, referred to.\nAlso, the division of income did not raise a case for election. The widow was given nothing but income. She had no interest in the residue. Her interest in the income was a specified monthly sum subject to increase in a certain contingency. There was nothing on the face of the will when this disposition was made inconsistent with her right to dower.\nRe Hill, [1951] O.R. 619, referred to.\nPer Spence J., dissenting: The testator had carefully outlined a scheme of division which was compact and complete and left no room for the widow's claim for dower carving out of the estate such an amount as might well defeat the operation of the scheme.\nHere it was not only the trustees' right but their duty to lease the suites, and the cases which held that an express power to lease puts the widow to her election applied equally to the situation in this estate. The realization that his trustees might have to hold the apartment house a few years before they could profitably realize upon it would cause the testator to give them the broad power to postpone conversion and to expect them to use it requiring them to lease and so in effect making a provision in his will inconsistent with his wife's taking dower from his estate.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, allowing an appeal from a judgment of Landreville J. Appeal dismissed, Spence J. dissenting.\nM. J. Galligan, for the appellant. Adrian T. Hewitt, Q.C., for the respondent, Mary Ann Grant.\nM. M. Kertzer, for the Executors.\nS. M. McBride, Q.C., for the Official Guardian.\nThe judgment of Cartwright, Abbott, Judson and Hall JJ. was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014The question in this appeal is whether the testator has put his widow to an election between the gifts to her under the will and her dower right in certain real property in the city of Ottawa. In order to raise a case for election under a will, there must be on the face of the will a disposition by the testator of something belonging to a person who takes an interest under the will. This means that where dower is involved, unless the widow is expressly put to her election, it must be found from the will itself and not from parol evidence that the testator intended to dispose of his property in a manner inconsistent with the widow's right to dower. The Court of Appeal has held, contrary to the judgment of the judge of first instance, that the widow was not put to her election. In my opinion, the judgment of the Court of Appeal is correct.\nThe contest here is between the widow and a daughter of a prior marriage. The testator disposed of three parcels of real estate. He devised a cottage property in the province of Quebec absolutely to his daughter. No question of dower has been raised in connection with this devise. He gave his wife the right to reside in 189 Acacia Road, Rockcliffe Park, in the province of Ontario, as long as she wished, and also $150 per month from the residue of the estate during her lifetime with the proviso that if she did not wish to continue in occupation of the house, and so notified the trustees in writing, she was to have an additional $150 per month. It has been held, and there is no appeal on this point, that the right to reside in 189 Acacia Road is a devise of a life estate. Consequently no question of dower arises with respect to this disposition. The third parcel of real estate is a small apartment building in the city of Ottawa which contains eight apartments. The wife claims dower in this apartment building in addition to the interest given to her by the will.\nThe dispositions of chattel property have no relevancy in this case. The testator made an elaborate list of the contents of 189 Acacia Road which the wife was permitted to use as long as she wished. The will contains a long list of chattels left absolutely to the daughter. The daughter is the residuary beneficiary.\nThe testator gave the whole of his estate to trustees on trusts of which the following are relevant to these reasons:\n(e) To use their discretion in the realization of my estate, with power to my trustees to sell, call in and convert into money any part of my estate not consisting of money at such time or times, in such manner and upon such terms, and either for cash or credit or for part cash and part credit as my said trustees may in their uncontrolled discretion decide upon, or to postpone such conversion of my estate or any part or parts thereof for such length of time as they may think best, or to reinvest any portion of the capital of my estate for such length of time as they may think best, and I hereby declare that my said trustees may retain any portion of my estate in the form in which it may be at my death (Notwithstanding that it may not be in the form of an investment in which trustees are authorized to invest trust funds, and whether or not there is a liability attached to any such portion of my estate) for such length of time as my said trustees may in their discretion deem advisable, and my trustees shall not be held responsible for any loss that may happen to my estate by reason of their so doing.\n(g) To keep invested the residue of my estate and subject as hereinafter provided, to pay the sum of One Hundred and Fifty ($150.00) dollars per month to or for my said wife during her lifetime, provided that if during such time my said wife shall relinquish possession of the house referred to in sub-paragraph (b) of this paragraph, my said trustees shall pay to my said wife an additional sum of One Hundred and Fifty ($150.00) dollars in lieu of the benefit granted under the said sub-paragraph (b).\n(h) To pay to my said daughter, Marjorie E. Abbott, for her own use absolutely the balance of the income from my estate.\n(i) Upon the death of the survivor of me and my said wife to deliver the residue of my estate to my daughter, Marjorie E. Abbott, or in the event that she shall have pre-deceased the survivor of me and my said wife, to divide the residue of my said estate among her issue in equal shares per stirpes.\nThe appellant's first submission is that there is an implied power to lease and that this is enough to put the widow to her election. With the trustee's powers to postpone conversion or sale and to retain the estate in the form in which it stood at the date of death, I have no difficulty in finding an implied power to lease. However, the cases where a widow must elect because of the power to lease have all involved express powers. Parker v. Sowerby[1] was such a case. So also were Patrick v. Shaver[2] and Re Hunter, Hunter v. Hunter[3]. But it is clear that this principle does not extend to implied powers for the reasons given by Proudfoot V.C. in Laidlaw v. Jackes[4], at pp. 297-8.\nAll the cases, where powers of leasing have been held to raise a case of election, have been cases of express powers, and proceeded upon the ground that they indicated an intention in the testator that his executors or trustees should exercise them, not only over his estate, but also over that of his wife. It is difficult to understand why any greater efficacy should be given to a power of this description than to a power of sale, which does not exclude dower: Patrick v. Shaver (21 Gr. 123); but at all events the reasoning does not apply to this implied power, which is only an incident to the implied estate, and that, I think, is subject to dower. It will not be presumed under these circumstances that the testator intended to confer a power over property which was not his, the wife's dower; but only intended that the executors should deal with his property, that is the land subject to the dower.\nProblems arising from dower were comparatively few in England because of the Dower Act, (1833) 3 & 4 Will. 4., c. 105, according to which a widow was not entitled to dower out of any land which had been absolutely disposed by the husband in his lifetime or by his will (32 Hals., 3rd ed., p. 304). But in Ontario the old law continued that when dower had once attached to the land, the husband could not get rid of it by act inter vivos or by will. Litigation in Ontario on problems of election was frequent during the second half of the 19th century and there is no doubt that the Courts applied very technical rules. But they were needed by the technicalities of the law of property and we ca'nnot modify them by judicial decision without adding to the confusion. It may well be that the whole problem of dower should be dealt with by the legislature in view of the present existence of legislation for the relief of dependants and the decreasing importance of real property in a modern estate as compared with earlier times.\nI am also of the opinion that the division of income does not raise a case of election. The trustees are to keep invested the residue of the estate and to pay the widow $150 per month, to be increased by another $150 per month if she gives up the residence, and to pay the balance of the income to the daughter. If real and personal estate are blended, not for the purpose of its equal division but in order to obtain an income out of which payments of stated amounts are to be made annually to the wife, the division of the corpus not being made until after the wife's death, this is not inconsistent with the right to dower. (Re Biggar, Biggar v. Stinson[5]; Leys v. Toronto General Trust Co.[6]; Re Urquhart[7]; Re Williamson[8]; Re Taylor[9].)\nOn the other hand, if the widow is given not a fixed annual sum out of the income of the blended fund but a percentage of the whole net income so that it is clear that the payments to her must depend upon actual net revenue received from the estate from time to time, the provision is inconsistent with dower.\nThe cases where there has been a direction to establish a blended fund from which periodical payments are to be made to the widow, are most recently reviewed in the judgment of McRuer C.J.H.C. in Re Hill[10]. I agree with these reasons in their preference for the judgment of Middleton J. in Re Williamson[11], as contrasted with the reasons in Re Hendry[12], and Re Williamson[13].\nThe present case is comparatively simple. The widow is given nothing but income. She has no interest in the residue. Her interest in the income is a specified monthly sum subject to increase in a certain contingency. There is nothing on the face of the will when this disposition is made inconsistent with her right to dower.\nI would dismiss the appeal and direct that the costs of all parties be payable out of the residue of the estate, those of the executors as between solicitor and client.\nSPENCE J. (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal by the daughter of the late James Duncan Grant from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario pronounced on April 16, 1964, by which that Court, reversing the judgment of Landreville J. pronounced on June 3, 1963, held that the testator's widow, the respondent Mary Ann Grant, was not required to elect between her dower and the gifts to her under the will. Leave to appeal was granted by the order of this Court made on October 6, 1964.\nThe basic principle for the determination of the question whether the widow is required to make her election as to dower is that given by Lord Cranworth in Parker v. Sowerby[14]:\nIt is not, I think, quite correct to state the general rule of law as being, that, to raise a case of election against the wife, the will must show that the Testator had in his mind her right to dower, and that he meant to exclude it; the rule rather is that it must appear from the Will that the Testator intended to dispose of his property in a manner inconsistent with his wife's right to dower. (The italicizing is my own.)\nIt is permissible to consider the circumstances in which the will was executed in so far as those circumstances appear in the record and I think I should outline those circumstances so that the words of the will may be considered in the light of the circumstances.\nThe testator was domiciled in Ottawa but executed his will in Regina, Saskatchewan, on November 17, 1959. He made a codicil on March 3, 1960.\nThe testator had been married previously and had one daughter, the appellant Marjorie E. Abbott. He married the defendant Mary Ann Grant who survived him and who is, therefore, his widow and it is a question of whether Mrs. Grant must elect her dower with which this appeal is concerned.\nSchedule \"A\" to the affidavit of John Fraser shows household goods and furniture at the Rockcliffe Park property\u2014$418, household goods and furniture at 125 Somerset St. West, Ottawa\u2014$50, 8-unit apartment house at 125 Somerset St. West\u2014$50,000, 189 Acacia Avenue, Rockcliffe Park\u2014$25,300, cash\u2014$325.\nThe estate consisted of those amounts plus a cottage property at Norway Bay, in the province of Quebec, and a very large number, some 44, of \"items of household use and ornaments\". It will be seen that the only income bearing property is the 8-unit apartment house on Somerset St. West. That apartment house is referred to in the affidavits of Monk, Beckett, Fraser and Hodginson, filed upon the application for interpretation of the will. Referring particularly to the last affidavit, the property is an 8-unit apartment house on a lot with 70' frontage and 103' depth and was a 3-storey, detached residence which has been converted. There is a 2-storey garage and storage building to the rear. Mr. Hodginson swore that he understood the buildings were from 50 to 60 years old. The property, therefore, has reached the age which, according to Mr. Hodginson, has resulted in a need for very extensive repairs both outside and inside. Mr. Fraser swore that the stoves and refrigerators were quite old and it would be necessary to replace them in the near future.\nThe net rental in the year ending June 30, 1961, as adjusted, amounted to $4,918.90, and in the year ending June 30,1962, amounted to $4,649.49.\nThose net rentals make no allowance for depreciation on the buildings or the stoves or refrigerators.\nIt must be presumed that the testator realized that the sole income bearing property in his estate was this apartment house and that the apartment house was one which if it was to be retained for any lengthy period was going to require a great deal of expenditure which could not help but affect seriously the net rental income. Now, under those circumstances, let us look at what he did in his last will and testament.\nIt would seem that the testator determined first the objects of his bounty and then carefully divided his estate between his widow and his daughter. Considering the bequests in the order he would think of them, he first set aside from his estate his cottage property in the province of Quebec and a carefully chosen list of personalty and gave them to his daughter absolutely. He then looked at the balance of his estate and determined how it should be utilized to discharge the claims on his bounty, firstly, the support of his widow, and then the enrichment of his daughter. It was apparent his widow would need adequate housing. He could provide that as he owned the residence at 189 Acacia Road, Rockcliffe Park, where she then resided, and so he provided that she should have the right to continue to reside there during her lifetime or until she gave notice in writing of her intention to abandon it. Of course, his widow needed furnishings therein and so he provided that she could have the use of those furnishings, which he carefully listed, during the period of occupancy and that thereafter they should go to his daughter absolutely. I realize that the specific devise of a piece of real estate alone will not require a widow to make her election: Re Hurst[15]; Leys v. Toronto General Trusts Co[16].\nI cite the devise of the cottage only as an incident of his careful division of his whole estate and therefore as an indication of his intent that the scheme should not be fractured by his widow requiring dower to be carved out.\nRealizing that his widow required more than a furnished home he then dealt with his remaining assets again with the purpose of first providing her with support and thereafter benefiting his daughter. The balance of his estate he put into a blended fund\u2014I shall deal with the powers given his executors in reference thereto hereafter\u2014and from that blended fund he directed payments as follows:\n(1) There should be paid all taxes, insurance, repairs, mortgage interest and any sums necessary for the upkeep of the residence which he permitted his widow to occupy. Although the premises would appear to be free of mortgage, the executors appear to have expended $831.05 for such purpose in the first year and $638.58 in the second year.\n(2) To his widow the sum of $150 per month for life and should she in writing relinquish her possession of the residence at 189 Acacia Road that sum was to be increased by a like amount.\n(3) To his daughter, the balance of the income of the estate.\n(4) Upon the death of his widow the need for her support having terminated the whole residue of his estate could be devoted to the enrichment of his daughter and the testator, therefore, so provided.\nUpon this analysis, I am inclined to conclude that the testator carefully outlined a scheme of division which covered his whole estate and distributed the whole of it so that the first claim on his bounty, i.e., the support of his widow, would be taken care of by providing her with a home, maintained at the cost of the estate, the necessary furnishings therefor so long as she chose to occupy it, and an allowance which he deemed sufficient to cover her other living expenses. Having accomplished such end, he was free to recognize the other claim to his bounty, his daugher. He did so by giving her those assets not required to assure the discharge of the first claim\u2014the cottage and the items of personalty\u2014outright, and any income not necessary to assure that first purpose and then accomplished his second purpose in full by giving all the residue to his daughter after his widow's death. It would appear to me that this scheme was compact and complete and left no room for the widow's claim for dower carving out of the estate such an amount as might well defeat the operation of the scheme.\nIt should be noted that the widow makes no claim for dower out of the cottage property in Quebec. Her estate in the property at 189 Acacia Road given by this will exceeds any dower right and therefore dower if taken would have to come from the Somerset St. West apartment. I have described that property, both its income and its condition. I do not think it can be said with certainty, and the testator could not have assumed, that if one-third of the income were taken out of that property to pay dower there would be enough left to maintain the expenses on the Acadia Road residence and pay the widow her monthly allowance. As I have pointed out, the apartment house would seem to be in imminent need of expensive and extensive repairs and the residence itself may require the expenditure of money\u2014such an expenditure is charged on the estate by the will.\nCounsel for the widow agrees that when a specific power to lease is given in a will, the widow is put to her election as to dower, but submits that such election has never been held to result from a mere implied power to lease. There are, as I have pointed out, specific powers to postpone, for as long as the trustees deem fit, conversion of assets in this will and certainly a power to lease is therefore implied. But when one considers that the sole income bearing real property was an apartment house, it is difficult to regard the power to lease as merely implied and permissive. If the trustees retain unconverted this asset then it is their duty to obtain an income from it and the only method whereby such income may be obtained is by leasing the suites. I am, therefore, of the opinion that it is not only the trustees' right but their duty to lease, and the cases which hold that an express power to lease puts the widow to her election apply equally to the situation in this estate.\nThe testator, evidently a careful and thoughtful man with sound business sense, would realize that Somerset St. West was close to the commercial centre of Ottawa but, at any rate, in November 1959 the commercial centre had not yet reached out to encompass it and that his trustees might have to hold the apartment house a few years before they could profitably realize upon it. Such realization would cause him to give his trustees the broad power to postpone conversion and to expect them to use it requiring them to lease and so in effect making a provision in his will inconsistent with his widow's taking dower from his estate.\nFor these reasons and upon considering the will as a whole, I have come to the conclusion that its provisions are inconsistent with the widow's right to dower and that she is put to her election. I would allow the appeal and restore the judgment of Landreville J. The costs of all parties should be paid out of the estate, those of the executors as between solicitor and client.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, SPENCE J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Mcllraith, Mcllraith, McGregor and Johnston, Ottawa.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Hewitt, Hewitt and Nesbitt, Ottawa.\nSolicitors for the executors and trustees: Kennedy, Sweet, Lepofsky and O'Neil, Ottawa.\nThe Official Guardian, Toronto.\n[1] (1854), 4 De G.

The plaintiff abandoned the car and ran off through a rocky, open, snow-covered field. He was not armed and had given no reason to suppose that he was. The defendant and the other police officer who was with him gave chase on foot. Several warning shots were fired by the two policemen. Owing to the rough terrain, the defendant fell twice while in pursuit. As the defendant prepared to fire another shot into the air, he fell again, striking his right elbow on the ground, and the shot was discharged accidentally. The plaintiff was struck in the back and seriously injured. Through his tutor, he sued both the defendant and the City of Montreal. The action against the City was dismissed at trial and it was no longer a party to this appeal. The action was tried by a judge and jury. The jury found against the defendant for 60 per cent, and this verdict was affirmed by the trial judge. The Court of Appeal reversed the judgment and dismissed the action.\nThe plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Fauteux, Martland and Judson JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the judgment at trial restored.\nPer Taschereau C. J. and Cartwright, Abbott, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ.: There was evidence upon which the jury could based its finding that the defendant was at fault for carrying a revolver with finger on the trigger while running over rough and stony ground after having previously fallen a number of times. This finding should not have been disturbed.\nPer Ritchie J.: It is apparent that the defendant himself did not consider the circumstances to be such as to make it necessary to fire at the fugitive. In fact these circumstances were not such as to justify his taking the risk of firing at him accidentally. The case of Priestman v. Colangelo, [1959] S.C.R. 615, was distinguishable.\nPer Ritchie and Spence JJ.: This case was not concerned with the provisions of s. 25 of the Criminal Code and the issue of justification. The defence was made upon the allegation that the plaintiff was shot accidentally. The matter was reduced to a pure question of negligence. On that question, the jury was entitled and probably should have made the inference that the defendant had his finger on the trigger throughout.\nPer Fauteux, Martland and Judson JJ., dissenting: The defendant was entitled, by reason of s. 25(4) of the Criminal Code, to use as much force as was necessary to prevent the plaintiff's escape, unless the escape could be prevented by reasonable means in a less violent manner. Force was not intentionally applied, and, apart from the firing of warning shots, it was difficult to see how, on the evidence, the plaintiff's escape could have been prevented by any means less violent than actually shooting at him. Moreover the trial judge was wrong in law when, charging the jury as to the use of force within the meaning of s. 25(4), he suggested that it did not matter whether the shot was fired intentionally or by accident.\nOn the question of negligence, the finding of the jury that the discharge of the revolver, though accidental, occurred through improper handling by the defendant, was not supported by the evidence. At best, it was an inference drawn from an answer given by the defendant which was only partially translated to them. The real issue as to whether the defendant was negligent was never determined at the trial. To hold the defendant to have been negligent would be erroneous. He was properly entitled to have his revolver in his hands. It was proper to seek to prevent the escape, without the use of any force, by the firing of warning shots into the air. It was not negligent to fire those shots while running, for, if the defendant had a duty to stop before firing into the air, the chances of the plaintiff's escape were enhanced, if he failed to heed the warning, and the likelihood of an arrest being made without actually shooting at him was thereby diminished.

Le demandeur abandonna la voiture et se mit \u00e0 courir \u00e0 travers un terrain rocailleux, ouvert, et recouvert de neige. II n'\u00e9tait pas arm\u00e9 et n'avait donn\u00e9 aucune raison de laisser supposer qu'il l'\u00e9tait. Le d\u00e9fendeur et l'autre policier qui \u00e9tait avec lui se mirent \u00e0 sa poursuite \u00e0 pied. Les deux policiers tir\u00e8rent plusieurs coups de revolver en l'air. Le d\u00e9fendeur tomba deux fois sur ce terrain raboteux. Comme le d\u00e9fendeur se pr\u00e9parait \u00e0 tirer un autre coup en l'air, il tomba une autre fois, heurta son coude droit sur le sol, et le coup partit accidentellement. La balle frappa le demandeur dans le dos et lui causa des blessures tr\u00e8s s\u00e9rieuses. Par l'entremise de son tuteur, il poursuivit le d\u00e9fendeur et la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al. L'action contre la cit\u00e9 fut rejet\u00e9e et elle n'est plus une partie dans cet appel. L'action fut entendue par un juge et jury. Le jury a tenu le d\u00e9fendeur responsable pour 60 pour cent, et ce verdict fut confirm\u00e9 par le juge au proc\u00e8s. La Cour d'Appel renversa ce jugement et rejeta l'action. Le demandeur en appela devant cette Cour.\nArr\u00eat: L'appel doit \u00eatre maintenu et le jugement rendu au proc\u00e8s r\u00e9tabli, les Juges Fauteux, Martland et Judson \u00e9tant dissidents.\nLe Juge en Chef Taschereau et les Juges Cartwright, Abbott, Ritchie, Hall et Spence: La preuve permettait au jury de trouver que le d\u00e9fendeur \u00e9tait en faute pour avoir eu un doigt sur la d\u00e9tente de son revolver alors qu'il courait sur un terrain raboteux et rocailleux, apr\u00e8s qu'il eut tomb\u00e9 nombre de fois auparavant. Cette conclusion n'aurait pas d\u00fb \u00eatre mise de c\u00f4t\u00e9.\nLe Juge Ritchie: Il est \u00e9vident que le d\u00e9fendeur lui-m\u00eame ne consid\u00e9rait pas que les circonstances \u00e9taient telles qu'il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire de tirer sur le fuyard. En fait, ces circonstances n'\u00e9taient pas telles qu'elles le justifiaient de prendre le risque de tirer accidentellement sur lui. La cause Priestman v. Colangelo, [1959] R.C.S. 615, pouvait \u00eatre diff\u00e9renci\u00e9e.\nLes Juges Ritchie et Spence: Cette cause ne porte pas sur les dispositions de l'art. 25 du Code criminel et la question de justification. La d\u00e9fense \u00e9tait bas\u00e9e sur l'all\u00e9gation que le demandeur avait \u00e9t\u00e9 atteint accidentellement. L'affaire \u00e9tait r\u00e9duite \u00e0 une pure question de n\u00e9gligence. Sur cette question, le jury avait le droit et probablement devait inf\u00e9rer que le d\u00e9fendeur avait eu tout le temps son doigt sur la d\u00e9tente.\nLes Juges Fauteux, Martland et Judson, dissidents: En vertu de l'art. 25(4) du Code Criminel, le d\u00e9fendeur \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9 d'employer la force n\u00e9cessaire pour emp\u00eacher la fuite du demandeur \u00e0 moins que l'\u00e9vasion puisse \u00eatre emp\u00each\u00e9e par des moyens raisonnables d'une fa\u00e7on moins violente. La force n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9e intentionnellement, et, \u00e0 part des coups tir\u00e9s en l'air, il est difficile de voir comment, en se basant sur la preuve, l'\u00e9vasion du demandeur aurait pu \u00eatre emp\u00each\u00e9e par des moyens moins violents que de faire feu directement sur lui. En plus, le juge au proc\u00e8s a err\u00e9 en droit lorsque, alors qu'il s'adressait au jury sur l'emploi de la force dans le sens de l'art. 25(4), il a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 qu'il n'importait pas que le coup ait \u00e9t\u00e9 tir\u00e9 intentionnellement ou par accident. Sur la question de n\u00e9gligence, le verdict du jury que le revolver s'\u00e9tait d\u00e9charg\u00e9, quoique accidentellement, parce que le d\u00e9fendeur l'avait mani\u00e9 improprement, n'\u00e9tait pas support\u00e9 par la preuve. Tout au plus, c'\u00e9tait une inf\u00e9rence tir\u00e9e d'une r\u00e9ponse donn\u00e9e par le d\u00e9fendeur et qui n'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 traduite que partiellement au jury. La v\u00e9ritable question de savoir si le d\u00e9fendeur avait \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9gligent n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9termin\u00e9e au proc\u00e8s. Il serait erron\u00e9 de dire que le d\u00e9fendeur avait \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9gligent. Il \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9 d'avoir son revolver \u00e0 la main. Il \u00e9tait en droit d'essayer d'emp\u00eacher l'\u00e9vasion, sans l'emploi de force, en tirant des coups dans l'air. Ce n'\u00e9tait pas une n\u00e9gligence que de tirer ces coups alors qu'il courait, parce que, si le d\u00e9fendeur avait un devoir d'arr\u00eater avant de tirer dans l'air, les chances que le demandeur puisse s'\u00e9chapper \u00e9taient augment\u00e9es si ce dernier ne s'occupait pas des avertissements, et les probabilit\u00e9s qu'il soit arr\u00eat\u00e9 sans qu'il soit n\u00e9cessaire de tirer directement sur lui \u00e9taient par cons\u00e9quent r\u00e9duites.\nAPPEL d'un jugement de la Cour du banc de la reine, province de Qu\u00e9bec[1], infirmant le verdict d'un jury. Appel maintenu, les Juges Fauteux, Martland et Judson \u00e9tant dissidents.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, province of Quebec[2], reversing the verdict of a jury. Appeal allowed, Fauteux, Martland and Judson JJ. dissenting.\nS. Leon Mendelsohn, Q.C., and Manuel Shactor, Q.C., for the plaintiff, appellant.\nPhilippe Beauregard, Q.C., and Joseph St-Laurent, Q.C., for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and of Cartwright, Abbout and Hall JJ. was delivered by\nABBOTT J.:\u2014On July 9, 1957, appellant, then a minor and acting through his tutor, sued the respondent and the City of Montreal claiming damages for injuries sustained by appellant as a result of a shot fired by respondent, a constable of the City of Montreal.\nThe action was tried before Charbonneau J. assisted by a jury. He rendered judgment affirming the verdict of the jury, dismissed the action as against the city and maintained the action as against respondent for an amount of $32,036.80.\nOn appeal[3] the dismissal of the action against the city was confirmed and there is no appeal to this Court from that judgment. However the respondent's appeal was allowed and the action against him was dismissed, Montgomery J. dissenting. The present appeal is from that judgment. The quantum of damages is not now in issue.\nThe facts, which are fully set out in the judgments below, are not seriously in dispute. I need not recite them in detail.\nThe appellant, who in 1957 was 14 years of age, was driving a stolen car the wrong way on a one-way street. Stopped by two City of Montreal policemen, Roland M\u00e9nard and the respondent Joseph Goyer, he abandoned the car and ran off through a rocky, open, snow-covered field, pursued by the police. He was not armed and had given no reason to suppose that he was. After several warning shots had been fired by the two policemen, the respondent Goyer stumbled and fell, at the same time firing another shot which hit appellant in the neck, seriously injuring him.\nThe sole question in issue before this Court is whether the respondent was at fault, in failing to exercise proper care in the use of firearms when pursuing the appellant.\nThe jury found that he was at fault for the following reason: \"Carrying revolver with finger on trigger while running over rough and stony ground after having previously fallen a number of times.\" There was evidence upon which the jury could base this finding and in my opinion it should not have been disturbed.\nEach of the decided cases dealing with the use of firearms by peace officers, which were cited to us, turns largely on its own facts. Having considered the evidence, the arguments of counsel and the authorities to which they referred, I find myself in agreement with the conclusion and reasons of Montgomery J. I do not think that anything would be gained by attempting to summarize or restate those reasons and I am content to adopt them.\nI would allow the appeal with costs here and below and restore the judgment at trial.\nThe judgment of Fauteux, Martland and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nMARTLAND J. (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal from the Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal Side) for the Province of Quebec[4], which, by a majority of four to one, allowed an appeal by the defendant, the present respondent, from a judgment which had been given at trial in favour of the plaintiff, the present appellant, for damages for personal injuries in the amount of $32,036.80, with interest and costs. The judgment at trial was based upon answers given to specific questions by a jury.\nThe appellant's injuries were sustained on January 22, 1957, when he was fourteen years of age. There is evidence that, in appearance, he looked considerably older. One independent witness who observed him on that date believed he was a young man of 22 or 23 years. The appellant was struck by a bullet fired from the revolver of the respondent, a police constable, who was pursuing him in order to effect his arrest. The respondent had been a member of the Montreal Police force since 1935.\nThe circumstances leading up to the shooting were as follows. Between eleven o'clock and noon on the morning of that day the respondent, with another police constable, M\u00e9nard, was driving in a police vehicle toward the north on Wilderton Street, in Montreal. The respondent was in uniform. Before leaving the police station they had been advised regarding certain automobiles reported stolen. As they approached the intersection with Goyer Street (a one way thoroughfare) they observed a Pontiac automobile travelling in the wrong direction on that street. The driver of that car, on seeing the police vehicle, effected a U turn at the intersection of Goyer and Wilderton and headed west along Goyer Street. The respondent was able to note the licence number of the Pontiac, and realized that it was one of the automobiles reported stolen. The respondent set off in pursuit.\nThe appellant ignored the respondent's signal to stop, proceeded at a high rate of speed, bumped into a stationary vehicle, and finally stopped to the left of and off the street, after mounting the sidewalk. He then leaped out of the car and ran across a rough, rocky field, partially covered with snow, where there were no roads or buildings.\nThe police car stopped and M\u00e9nard was the first to commence the pursuit. He ran after the appellant, calling out to him, in both French and English, to stop. When this had no effect, he fired four shots in the air from his revolver. He ceased the chase when he was out of breath.\nThe respondent, for a time, was able to follow, in his automobile, the course taken by the appellant. He then left the car and ran in pursuit of the appellant. He also called to him, in both French and English, to stop, and he fired two warning shots in the air from his revolver. The appellant continued to run. Owing to the rough terrain, the respondent fell twice while in pursuit.\nThe respondent than prepared to fire a third shot into the air, but fell again, striking his right elbow on the ground, and a shot was discharged accidentally. This shot struck the appellant in the back, fracturing his spine. As a consequence the appellant suffered partial paralysis.\nThe appellant, through his tutor, sued both the respondent and the City of Montreal, of whose police force the respondent was a member. The action against the City was dismissed at the trial and it is no longer a party to the appeal before this Court.\nThe questions submitted to the jury at the trial, which are relevant to this appeal, and the answers given are as follows:\nQuestion Number One:\nWas the minor Ralph Biem, on January 22nd, 1957, hit by a bullet fired by the Defendant Joseph Goyer?\nAnswer: Yes.\nQuestion Number Two:\nWas the said Ralph Beim then in flight in fear of arrest?\nAnswer: Yes.\nQuestion Number Three:\nIf you have answered the preceding question in the affirmative, was Ralph Beim then in flight in fear of arrest because:\n(a) he had contravened municipal bylaws; or\n(b) he knew that he had been driving a stolen automobile?\nAnswer: (a) no and (b) yes.\nQuestion Number Four:\nDid the said Defendant Joseph Goyer shoot at the said Ralph Beim voluntarily, or was his revolver discharged accidentally?\nAnswer: Accidentally.\nQuestion Number Five:\nIf you have come to the conclusion that the revolver was on that occasion discharged accidentally, state if that discharge occurred;\n(a) by pure accident?\n(b) through improper handling by Defendant Joseph Goyer?\nAnswer: (a) by pure accident? No.\n(b) through improper handling by Defendant Joseph Goyer?\nAnswer: Yes.\nAnd in the affirmative, give all details as to how the said handling was improper or negligent? Answer: Carrying a revolver with finger on the trigger while running over rough and stony ground, after having previously fallen a number of times.\nQuestion Number Six:\nWas constable Joseph Goyer then attempting to arrest the said Ralph Beim,\n(a) because the latter may have contravened a municipal by-law, e.g., by driving too fast or in the wrong direction or making a U turn?\nAnswer: No.\nor (b) because he had reason to believe that the said Ralp Beim was committing a criminal offence driving an automobile which had been stolen?\nAnswer: Yes.\nQuestion Number Seven:\nIf you have come to the conclusion either that the revolver was discharged voluntarily or accidentally through neglect or want of skill of Defendant Joseph Goyer, was the said constable using an excess of force, and could the escape of Ralph Beim have been prevented by reasonable means in a less violent manner?\nAnswer: Yes.\nQuestion Number Eight:\nWas the said Ralph Beim wholly responsible for the injury he suffered, and in the affirmative state in detail what fault or faults he committed?\nAnswer: No.\nQuestion Number Nine:\nWas the said Ralph Beim responsible in part for the injury he suffered, and in the affirmative state what fault or faults he committed and the proportion you ascribe to his fault?\nAnswer: Yes, with qualifications. Aside from traffic violations, knowingly driving a stolen car and failing to stop when called upon to do so by a police officer; Beim fault 60%.\nOn the basis of these answers, the learned trial judge gave judgment in favour of the appellant against the respondent in the amount assessed by the jury and applying the percentage of fault attributed by the jury to the respondent. The respondent's appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal Side) was successful.\nThe only issue seriously contested in this Court was that of liability.\nIn considering that question, attention must first be given to the provisions of s. 25(4) of the Criminal Code, which provides:\n(4) A peace officer who is proceeding lawfully to arrest, with or without warrant, any person for an offence for which that person may be arrested without warrant, and every one lawfully assisting the peace officer, is justified, if the person to be arrested takes flight to avoid arrest, in using as much force as is necessary to prevent the escape by flight, unless the escape can be prevented by reasonable means in a less violent manner.\nThe effect of that provision was considered by this Court in Priestman v. Colangelo[5]. In that case two police officers in a patrol car were pursuing the driver of a stolen vehicle. On three occasions, when trying to pass the stolen car, the driver of it cut off the police car. Thereafter one of the officers, after firing a warning shot into the air, which went unheeded, took aim at a rear tire of the stolen car. As he fired, the police car struck a bump in the road and the shot hit the driver of the stolen car. He lost control of the vehicle, which struck and killed two persons standing on the sidewalk. The issue in this Court was as to the liability of the police officer who fired the shot to the administrators of their estates.\nUnlike the present appeal, in the Priestman case the shot was deliberately fired, on a city street, in a populated area, and set in motion events which resulted in the deaths of two innocent people. Nonetheless, the claim against the police officer failed.\nLocke J., who delivered the judgment of Taschereau J., as he then was, and himself, said, at p. 620:\nActionable negligence has been defined in a variety of manners. In Vaughan v. the Taff Vale Railway Company, (1860), 5 H. & N. 679 at 688, 157 E.R. 1351, Willes J. said that the definition of negligence is the absence of care according to the circumstances. The concluding words of this short definition are at times lost sight of and are those which must be kept most clearly in mind in considering an action such as the present, which is based on what is said to have been a negligent manner of discharging the duty which rested upon the constables.\nAt p. 624 he said:\nThe difficulty is not in determining the principle of law that is applicable but in applying it in circumstances such as these. In Rex v. Smith, (1907), 13 C.C.C. 326, 17 Man. R. 282, Perdue J.A., in charging a jury at the trial of a police officer for manslaughter, is reported to have said that shooting is the very last resort and that only in the last extremity should a police officer resort to the use of a revolver in order to prevent the escape of an accused person who is attempting to escape by flight. With all the great respect that I have for any statement of the law expressed by the late Chief Justice of Manitoba, in my opinion this is too broadly stated and cannot be applied under all circumstances. Applied literally, it would presumably mean in the present case that, being unable to get in front of the escaping car, due to the criminal acts of Smythson, the officers should have abandoned the chase and summoned all the available police forces to prevent the escape. This would have involved ignoring their obligation to endeavour to prevent injury to other members of the public at the intersections which would be reached within a few seconds by the escaping car.\nPolice officers in this country are furnished with firearms and these may, in my opinion, be used when, in the circumstances of the particular case, it is reasonably necessary to do so to prevent the escape of a criminal whose actions, as in the present case, constitute a menace to other members of the public. I do not think that these officers having three times attempted to stop the fleeing car by endeavouring to place their car in front of it were under any obligation to again risk their lives by attempting this. No other reasonable or practical means of halting the car has been suggested than to slacken its speed by blowing out one of the tires.\nFauteux J., who also decided in favour of the appellant police officer, adopted the reasons of Laidlaw J.A. in the Court of Appeal[6]. At page 11 Laidlaw J.A. said:\nIf this Court cannot properly regard the conclusions of the learned trial Judge as including an inference of fact that the respondent Priestman was not negligent, and can properly reach its decision on the basis that no such inference was drawn from the evidence by the learned trial Judge, neverthless, I am not willing to draw that inference. I subscribe without reservation to the view expressed by the learned trial Judge that \"it is easy now to sit and speculate in the calm of the Courtroom and say the defendant Priestman might have continued the chase and that eventually Smythson would have been apprehended and no one hurt, but this is not helpful.\" It is extremely difficult, if not impossible, after an unfortunate happening to blot out from one's mind the wisdom and sense of good judgment acquired from that happening. The tendency by reason of the happening, to criticize or find fault with one or more of the parties involved in it is natural and hard to overcome. A judicial finding as to whether or not there was negligence or misconduct of one or more parties involved in a happening of the kind in question in the instant case, requires that the happening and the unfortunate results therefrom be erased from one's mind as completely as possible. The judicial mind must be carefully directed to the time and place of the happening and the conduct of the parties in the circumstances then existing must be measured by comparing it with the conduct of that fictitious creature of the law,\u2014the reasonable man. With that approach to the question I ask myself, what would a police constable, exercising reasonable care and placed in the position of the respondent Priestman, have done or omitted in the particular circumstances existing at the time of the happening in question?\nAt page 15 he also said:\nAgain, it appears to me that if Priestman's arm holding the revolver had not been jolted at the very instant he fired the revolver, by the uneven road surface, there would be no ground of complaint whatsoever as to his conduct. In order to find that he was negligent I think it would be necessary to find that he ought reasonably to have foreseen that his arm might be jolted at the instant he fired, and that the injuries that resulted were such as a reasonable man would contemplate. I am not willing to make that finding. I refer to Bolton v. Stone, (1951) A.C. 850 at p. 856, referred to also by my brother Schroeder J.A. The dissenting reasons in the Priestman case, delivered by Cartwright J., were based mainly on the fact that the claims involved were by innocent parties, not by the wrongdoer, and that s. 25(4) would not serve as a defence to their claims.\nIn the present case the respondent was entitled, by reason of s. 25(4), to use as much force as was necessary to prevent the appellant's escape, unless the escape could be prevented by reasonable means in a less violent manner. He was equipped, for the carrying out of his duties, with an offensive weapon, which, within the limits defined in s. 25(4), he was lawfully entitled to use. In fact, as found by the jury, he did not voluntarily shoot at the appellant, but fired his weapon accidentally. As was pointed out by Rinfret J., in the Court below, there was no question of force being applied in the circumstances of this case, let alone excessive force, since the element of intention was wholly lacking.\nThis being so, I do not see how the jury's answer to question 7 can properly stand. The question, as framed, was a double-barrelled question, but, as pointed out above, force was not intentionally applied, and, apart from the firing of warning shots, it is difficult to see how, on the evidence, the appellant's escape could have been prevented by any means less violent than actually shooting at him.\nIn connection with this question it should be noted that there was what, in my opinion, was an error in law in the charge to the jury. When dealing with question 7, the learned trial judge read to the jury the headnote in the case of Robertson v. Joyce[7], which dealt with the meaning and intention of s. 41 of the old Code, the predecessor of s. 25(4). He went on then to say:\nThis was also a case in which the officer claimed that he had stumbled and that his revolver had been discharged accidentally. But the liability, the civil liability would be the same whether he had shot intentionally or by accident through negligence. The criminal liability would be different but civilly the liability for damage done voluntarily or on account of negligence or mishandling of a firearm would be the same.\nI think the learned trial judge was wrong, when charging the jury as to the use of force within the meaning of s. 25(4), in suggesting that it did not matter whether the shot was fired intentionally or by accident.\nI now turn to consider the issue of negligence and the answer of the jury to question 5, in which the jury found that the discharge of the revolver, though accidental, occurred through improper handling by the respondent. When asked to give details, the answer was:\nCarrying a revolver with finger on the trigger while running over rough and stony ground, after having previously fallen a number of times.\nWhen charging the jury in respect of this question, the only instructions given by the learned trial judge were as follows:\nAll I can say on this is that in my opinion\u2014and again you do not have to follow it\u2014in my opinion if the revolver was discharged accidentally it would be through the fault and negligence of Defendant Goyer. He had tripped twice before. He was running with a cocked revolver. That is my opinion. Do not follow me if you do not agree.\nAt the end of his charge, a question was asked by one of the jurors:\nIs there any way of establishing whether a gun can discharge itself accidentally with the finger not on the trigger of the gun?\nThe respondent was then recalled to the stand, and the following questions were asked by the learned trial judge and answers given by the respondent, all in the French language:\nD. Monsieur Goyer, le Jury veut savoir si votre revolver n'\u00e9tait pas parti accidentellement, auriez-vous tir\u00e9 volontairement sur le jeune homme? R. Non.\nD. Combien d'ann\u00e9es d'exp\u00e9rience avez-vous avec des revolvers? R. Depuis mil neuf cent trente-cinq (1935), Votre Seigneurie.\nD. Quelle sorte de revolver aviez-vous? R. Un Colt trente-huit (38), Votre Seigneurie.\nD. Ce revolver-l\u00e0 peut-il partir si vous n'avez pas le doigt sur le chien? R. Il faut avoir le doigt sur la g\u00e2chette pour le partir; lorsque le coup a parti l\u00e0, j'avais le doigt sur la g\u00e2chette; en tirant en l'air \u2026\nThe charge to the jury was all delivered in English and the learned trial judge interpreted the questions and the respondent's answers to the jury as follows:\nQ. How many years experience have you had with a revolver? A. Since 1935.\nQ. What kind of revolver did you have? A. A Colt 38.\nQ. Can that revolver go off if your finger in not on the trigger? A. I must have my finger on the trigger before it can go off.\nIt will be noted that the latter portion of the last answer was not translated, and this omission is of importance. The respondent was testifying that the shot which struck the appellant was being fired into the air. There was no evidence that the respondent had his finger on the trigger while running over the rough ground. The evidence shows that he had his finger on the trigger when about to fire into the air when he fell and the revolver discharged on his elbow hitting the ground.\nIn order to find liability on the part of the respondent, on the basis of this evidence, it was necessary to find that it was negligence, on his part, to carry his revolver in his hand when pursuing the appellant and to use it to fire warning shots into the air in the course of that pursuit. In considering whether or not that conduct was negligent, it is essential to consider the nature of the duty owed by the respondent to the appellant, and to bear in mind the relationship between them.\nThis is not a case of an ordinary citizen being struck by a bullet fired from a revolver carried by another ordinary citizen. It might well be negligent for an ordinary citizen to run with a loaded revolver in his hand when another person might be in the vicinity. This, however, is the case of a person seeking to escape arrest being pursued by a police officer fixed with a legal duty to arrest him and empowered by law to use as much force as necessary to prevent his escape, unless the escape could be prevented by reasonable means in a less violent manner.\nThe finding made by the jury in its answer to question 5 was not supported by the evidence. At best, it was an inference drawn from an answer given by the respondent which was only partially translated to them. The learned trial judge himself misunderstood this evidence, because, in his judgment given after the jury had answered the questions, he said:\nin addition, this point was later cleared by the constable, when he was reexamined at the request of the jurors and stated that he was carrying the revolver with his finger on the trigger while running over rough and stony ground, and it was precisely that fault which was found by the jurors.\nThe issue which the jury should have been asked to determine was whether the conduct of the respondent, during his pursuit of the appellant, was negligent, and, in determining that issue, they should have been instructed that such conduct had to be considered in light of the fact that the appellant was seeking to escape arrest, and that the respondent was a peace officer, with the rights defined in s. 25(4) of the Criminal Code. They should have been asked to determine whether, under those circumstances, it was negli- gent for the respondent to carry his revolver in his hand, and whether it was negligent for him to fire a warning shot in the course of pursuit without coming to a halt. Instead of this, the jury was told, in terms, that, in the opinion of the learned trial judge, if the revolver discharged accidentally, it would be through the respondent's fault and negligence.\nThe real issue in this case was never determined at the trial, and, for that reason, at best, in my opinion the appellant should be entitled to no more than an order for a new trial. No request for a new trial was made by the appellant in this appeal.\nIn my opinion, however, a decision on the substantial issue holding the respondent to have been negligent would have been erroneous.\nWhen pursuing the appellant, the respondent was properly entitled to have his revolver in his hand. Further, it was proper to seek to prevent the escape, without the use of any force, by the firing of warning shots into the air. I do not think it was negligent to fire those shots while running, for, if the respondent had a duty to stop before firing into the air, the chances of the appellant's escape were enhanced, if he failed to heed the warning, and the likelihood of an arrest being made without actually shooting at him was thereby diminished.\nI agree with the views expressed by Rivard J. in the Court below when he said:\nGoyer avait le droit et le devoir de poursuivre le jeune Beim. Il avait \u00e9galement le droit d'\u00eatre arm\u00e9. Il avait le droit et le devoir de prendre les moyens n\u00e9cessaires pour op\u00e9rer son arrestation. Il avait le droit de tirer en l'air pour lui communiquer le s\u00e9rieux de ses avertissements. La poursuite de Beim par Goyer, les coups de feu que ce dernier a tir\u00e9s vers le ciel demeurent dans les limites des droits reconnus par l'article 25 du Code Criminel, \u00e0 un constable lance \u00e0 la poursuite d'un fugitif.\nOn lui reproche d'avoir couru sur un terrain glissant, rocailleux et partiellement recouvert de neige avec le revolver dans sa main. Si Goyer avait le droit de poursuivre Beim, il fallait n\u00e9cessairement qu'il emprunte le chemin que Beim avait lui-m\u00eame choisi. Beim se dirigeait vers un endroit o\u00f9 il y avait une voie ferr\u00e9e et o\u00f9 il lui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 certainement facile de dispara\u00eetre. Il n'y avait personne dans les environs que Goyer pouvait appeler \u00e0 son aide. Rien dans la preuve ne sugg\u00e8re un autre moyen de r\u00e9aliser l'arrestation de Beim. Si Goyer avait le droit de tirer en l'air, en poursuivant Beim, il fallait n\u00e9cessairement qu'il ait son arme \u00e0 la main. On ne peut pr\u00e9tendre qu'il devait s'arr\u00eater chaque fois qu'il tirait en l'air, remettre son revolver dans sa gaine et repartir \u00e0 courir. C'eut \u00e9t\u00e9 assurer la fuite certaine du fugitif.\nDans les circonstances, je suis convaincu que Goyer n'a pas us\u00e9 de force excessive et a utilis\u00e9 les seuls moyens qu'il pouvait prendre pour tenter d'op\u00e9rer l'arrestation de Beim. Beim a \u00e9t\u00e9 le malheureux artisan de son infortune.\nLes faits rapport\u00e9s par le Jury n'\u00e9tablissent aucune faute chez Goyer, et je crois qu'en cons\u00e9quence, la motion pour jugement rejetant l'action, malgr\u00e9 le verdict, aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre accord\u00e9e.\nFor these reasons I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014The facts of this case have been thoroughly discussed in the reasons for judgment of other members of the Court and it would be superfluous for me to reiterate them.\nI am in agreement with my brothers Abbott and Spence that this appeal should be allowed and only wish to add that the case of Priestman v. Colangelo[8] which is referred to in the reasons for judgment of my brother Martland is, in my view, distinguishable on the ground that in finding that under the circumstances there disclosed it was reasonably necessary for the policeman to fire at the tire of a fleeing car, Locke J. predicated his judgment on the fact that the person who had taken flight to avoid arrest was prepared, in order to escape, to jeopardize the lives of two policemen. In the course of his reasons for judgment, Locke J. said:\nIn considering whether the action of Priestman in firing the second shot was a reasonable attempt by him to discharge his duty, it is to be borne in mind that, as the constables were both aware Smythson was a thief and he had demonstrated that he was prepared, in order to escape, to jeopardize both of their lives.\nThe italics are my own.\nNo such danger existed in relation to Beim who was unarmed and running away on foot. The standard adopted by Laidlaw J. A. in the Priestman case in the Court of Appeal of Ontario[9], appears to me to be appropriate in the present case. Mr. Justice Laidlaw there said of the policeman:\nIn order to find that he was negligent I think it would be necessary to find that he ought reasonably to have foreseen that his arm might be jolted at the instant he fired, and that the injuries that resulted were such as a reasonable man would contemplate. I am not willing to make that finding.\nIn the present case, the fact that Goyer had already fallen twice in running over the rough ground in pursuit of the appellant in my opinion created a situation in which he \"ought reasonably to have foreseen that his arm might be jolted at the instant he fired\u2026\" if he should fall again as he was likely to do, and that if he did so while firing a shot he might hit Ralph Beim. It is apparent that Goyer himself did not consider the circumstances to be such as to make it necessary to fire at the fugitive and I do not think they were such as to justify his taking the risk of firing at him accidentally.\nSPENCE J.: I have had the advantage of reading the reasons of my brothers Abbott and Martland and agree with those of the former. I wish to add, however, reference to certain submissions made to this Court.\nThis is an appeal by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal Side) for the Province of Quebec[10] whereby that court by a majority allowed the respondent's appeal from a judgment given by Charbonneau J. after trial by jury. In the judgment at trial, the plaintiff Beim was allowed $32,036.80 against the respondent Goyer and the action was dismissed against the City of Montreal. The defendant Goyer appealed to the Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal Side) and the plaintiff appealed from the dismissal of the claim against the City of Montreal and against the quantum of the damages allowed but both the latter appeals were dismissed and the plaintiff has not further appealed from such dismissals.\nThe judgment at trial was rendered upon the findings of the jury in answer to certain questions. The important questions and answers are Nos. 5 and 7.\nQuestion 5:\nIf you have come to the conclusion that the revolver was on that occasion discharged accidently, state if that discharge occurred, (a) by pure accident, or (b) through improper handling by defendant Joseph Goyer?\nThe jury answered \"No\" to sub-part (a) and \"Yes\" to sub-part (b), and then added this explanation: \"Carrying revolver with finger on trigger while running over rough and stony ground after having previously fallen a number of times\".\nQuestion 7 read as follows:\nIf you have come to the conclusion either that the revolver was discharged voluntarily, or accidentally through neglect or want of skill of defendant Joseph Goyer, was the said constable using an excess of force, and could the escape of Ralph Beim have been prevented by reasonable means in a less violent manner?\nThe jury answered \"Yes\".\nIn argument in this Court, counsel for the respondent took the position that the answer to question No. 5 could not have been made by a jury properly instructed as there was no evidence that the defendant kept his finger on the trigger of the revolver as he ran across this rough and stony field with the revolver in his hand. Counsel for the respondent objected to Question No. 7 having been put on the ground that the allegation that the arrest of the plaintiff could have been accomplished in a less violent manner was not made by the plaintiff in his pleading.\nTo deal with the latter objection, I am of the view that the issue dealt with in question No. 7 was sufficiently brought into the plaintiff's pleadings in paragraph 5 of the Declaration, and further that the defendant actually put that point in issue in his particulars to the defence, particularly paras. 29 to 31 of the Particulars.\nI am of the opinion that there is a much more effective reply to the defence submission. We are not really concerned at all with the provisions of s. 25 of the Criminal Code and the issue of justification. The defendant has always sworn and made his whole defence upon the allegation that the plaintiff was shot accidentally and there was no question of justification for the use of any degree of force. The matter is reduced to a pure question of negligence.\nThe objection to question No. 5 and its answer seems to be base upon the submission that the trial judge mistranslated to the jury some questions and answers made by the defendant.\nWhat occurred was this: When the judge finished his charge to the jury, juror No. 2 requested that a hypothetical question be put to the defendant. The defendant was asked to re-enter the witness box and was sworn in and asked that hypothetical question. Then juror No. 7 asked the question of the judge, \"Is there any way of establishing whether a gun can discharge itself accidentally with a finger not on the trigger of the gun?\" By the Court, \"As to that I can tell you that there are many hunting accidents\u2014how the gun goes off\u2014if the bullet is in the gun there, a gun must be locked if you walk or run. I can ask the constable. Do you want me to ask the constable as to that particular gun?\" By juror No. 7, \"If he can give us an authoritative answer\".\nThe questions of the Court to the defendant in the French language and his answers in the French language are set out in the record as follows: D. Monsieur Goyer, le Jury veut savoir si votre revolver n'\u00e9tait pas parti accidentellement, auriez-vous tir\u00e9 volontairement sur le jeune homme? R. Non.\nD. Combien d'ann\u00e9es d'exp\u00e9rience avez-vous avec des revolvers? R. Depuis mil neuf cent trente-cinq (1935), Votre Seigneurie.\nD. Quelle sorte de revolver aviez-vous? R. Un Colt trente-huit (38), Votre Seigneurie.\nD. Ce revolver-l\u00e0 peut-il partir si vous n'avez pas le doigt sur le chien? R. Il faut avoir le doigt sur la g\u00e2chette pour le partir; lorsque le coup a parti l\u00e0, j'avais le doigt sur la g\u00e2chette; en tirant en l'air.\nIn the transcript of the charge, there is inserted the comment \"here there were questions and answers in the French language which were then interpreted by the Court as follows:\nQ. How many years experience have you had with a revolver? A. Since 1935.\nQ. What kind of revolver did you have? A. A Colt 38.\nQ. Can that revolver go off if your finger is not on the trigger? A. I must have my finger on the trigger before it can go off.\nCounsel in argument in this Court pointed out that the actual questions put to the witness and his answers should be properly translated as follows:\nQ. Mr. Goyer, the jury wish to know if your revolver had not gone off accidentally would you have fired voluntarily on this young man? A. No.\nQ. How many years of experience have you with revolvers? A. Since 1935, Your Lordship.\nQ. What sort of revolver had you? A. A Colt 38, Your Lordship.\nQ. That revolver there, could it go off if you had not your finger on the trigger? A. It is necessary to have one's finger on the trigger for it to go off; when the shot went off there, I had my finger on the trigger; in firing in the air.\nIt will be seen that the learned trial judge failed to translate the last part of the witness's answer, i.e., \"when the shot went off there, I had my finger on the trigger; in firing in the air\". We are assured by counsel for the respondent, and counsel for the appellant does not suggest otherwise, that there was no evidence that as the constable ran across the field he had kept his finger on the trigger throughout, only that he had his finger on the trigger when the shot was accidentally fired.\nCounsel for the respondent adds that if Goyer had admitted that he had his finger on the trigger as he ran across this rocky field then \"he would not be here\" which must mean that he would not have appealed to the Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal Side) as, of course, he is in this court as a respondent. I am of the opinion that there is no weight to the contention. Even granting that there was no evidence that the defendant constable kept his finger on the trigger as he ran across the rocky field, there was evidence that on two occasions as he ran across the field he fired shots in the air. There was evidence that he twice fell while running across that field before the fall which caused the injuring shot. There is no evidence that on the occasion of either of the previous falls the gun went off. However, a jury certainly was entitled and probably even should have made the inference that the defendant constable had his finger on the trigger throughout. There certainly was no evidence that he stopped on either occasion when he fired a shot in the air and therefore he would have had to have been running with his finger on the trigger when both of those previous shots were fired in the air. It would be foolish to imagine that he took his finger off the trigger and then, continuing to run, on three occasions, put his finger on the trigger and fired the fun. Further, even if the evidence had been that he did not put his finger on the trigger until he actually shot twice purposely in the air and the third time accidentally hitting the plaintiff, there was evidence, and the strongest evidence, of negligence. To have run across that field and then shot in the air while continuing to run was negligence even if he only put his finger on the trigger at the moment he fired the shot. The same result could have occurred on either of those first shots in the air as that which occurred on the third occasion, i.e., he might have fallen and the bullet which he had intended to fire into the air might have hit the plaintiff.\nI would allow the appeal with costs against the respondent throughout and restore the verdict of the jury giving the plaintiff the damages as fixed by the jury, $32,036.80 with interest from the 27th of November 1958, the date of the trial.\nAppeal allowed, Fauteux, Martland and Judson JJ. dissenting.\nAttorneys for the plaintiff, appellant: L.

Following his conviction for the offence of having possession of instruments for house-breaking, the appellant gave notice of his intention to appeal on a printed form in which he expressly stated his wish to be present and to present oral argument. When the matter came before the Court of Appeal, the appellant was not present; he was still in custody; he was not represented by counsel and had not been notified of the date on which the appeal was to be heard. The Court of Appeal nevertheless dismissed his appeal from conviction and increased his sentence from two to five years. He was granted leave to appeal to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the record should be referred back to the Court of Appeal for a hearing in accordance with the Criminal Code.\nUnder s. 594(1) of the Code, the appellant had a statutory right to be present and to submit his case by oral argument. When it appeared that he had expressed his desire to be present, that he was not present and that he had received no notice of the date of the hearing, the Court of Appeal had no right to enter upon the hearing and should have adjourned the case to enable the appellant to be present.

APPEAL from a judgment from the Court of Appeal for Ontario, affirming the appellant's conviction. Appeal allowed.\nB.Carter, for the appellant.\nC.Powell, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario is brought pursuant to leave granted by this court on April 27, 1965, on the following question of law:\nHad the Court of Appeal jurisdiction to enter upon the hearing of the application to that Court when the appellant, who had given notice that he desired to be present at the hearing of his appeal, was in custody, was not represented by counsel, was not present at the hearing of the appeal and had not been notified of the time of the hearing of his appeal?\nThe appellant was convicted before His Honour Judge Moore at Toronto on April 16, 1964, of the offence of having possession of instruments for house-breaking, without lawful excuse, contrary to s. 295 of the Criminal Code, and was sentenced on the same day to two years imprisonment.\nThe appellant who was then in custody in the Toronto jail gave a notice dated May 7, 1964, on a printed form headed: \"Form of Notice of Appeal or Application for leave to Appeal.\"\nFollowing the heading giving the appellant's name and particulars of the conviction and sentence as contemplated by the printed form, the notice reads as follows:\nI hereby give you notice that I desire to appeal (or apply for leave to appeal, as the case may be) to the Court of Appeal against my conviction (or against my sentence) on the grounds following:\u2014\nSee Attached sheets.\nI desire to present my case and argument \"By Oral Argument\" (Fill in either \"in writing\" or \"by oral argument,\" as the case may be)\nIf a new trial is directed I \"Desire\"\n(\"desire\" or \"do not desire\" as the case may be)\nthat such new trial be before a jury.\nMy address for service is 550 Gerrard Street East, Toronto, Ontario.\n(Fill in carefully, as this is important)\nDated this 7th day of May, 1964.\nBradford L. Smith\n(Signature of the appellant or of his solicitor or counsel) The \"Attached sheets\" referred to in the notice set out eleven numbered grounds none of which involves a question of law alone.\nThe matter came before the Court of Appeal on June 23, 1964. The appellant was not present; he was still in custody; he was not represented by counsel and he had been given no notice of the date on which the appeal was to be heard. That this is so was stated before us by counsel for the appellant and by counsel for the Attorney General.\nAt the conclusion of the hearing the Court of Appeal delivered oral reasons in which no reference is made to the absence of the accused. The formal judgment of the Court reads as follows:\nThis is to certify that the application for leave to appeal and the appeal in writing of the above named Bradford Leonard Smith against his conviction and sentence, having come on to be heard before this Court this day in the presence of Counsel for the Crown, and upon having read the Notice of Application for leave to appeal and Judge's Report, and upon hearing what was alleged by Counsel for the Crown, aforesaid,\nThis Court did order that the said appeal against conviction should be and the same was thereby dismissed as frivolous.\nAnd this Court did further order that the application for leave to appeal against sentence should be and the same was thereby granted, and that the sentence of two (2) years be set aside and a sentence of five (5) years in penitentiary substituted therefor.\nRule 16 of the Criminal Appeal Rules in force in Ontario at the time the matter was dealt with by the Court of Appeal, read as follows:\n16. If it is not the intention of the appellant to present his case before the Court orally he shall be at liberty to make his argument in writing, in which case notice of his intention shall be embodied in the notice of appeal or notice of application for leave to appeal, and a copy of the written argument shall be left with the Registrar when the appeal is set down or within seven days thereafter.\nThe appellant's notice quoted above made it clear that he intended to present his case before the Court orally and not to make his argument in writing.\nRule 17 of the same rules read as follows:\n17. When the appeal or application for leave to appeal is ready for hearing the Registrar shall give notice to the appellant and to the Attorney General of the date that has been fixed for the hearing of the application and shall place the case upon the list for hearing upon that date.\nThe Registrar did not give to the appellant the notice required by this rule. Section 594 of the Criminal Code reads as follows:\n594 (1) Subject to subsection (2), an appellant who is in custody is entitled, if he desires, to be present at the hearing of the appeal.\n(2) An appellant who is in custody and who is represented by counsel is not entitled to be present\n(a) at the hearing of the appeal, where the appeal is on a ground involving a question of law alone,\n(b) on an application for leave to appeal, or\n(c) on any proceedings that are preliminary or incidental to an appeal,\nunless rules of court provide that he is entitled to be present or the court of appeal or a judge thereof gives him leave to be present.\n(3) A convicted person who is an appellant may present his case on appeal and his argument in writing instead of orally, and the court of appeal shall consider any case or argument so presented.\n(4) The power of a court of appeal to impose sentence may be exercised notwithstanding that the appellant is not present.\nIn the circumstances of this case we are concerned only with subs. (1). Subsection (2) has no application because the accused was not represented by counsel.\nUnder this section the appellant had a statutory right to be present and to submit his case to the Court by oral argument. When it appeared (i) that he had expressed his desire to be present (ii) that he was not present and (iii) that he had received no notice of the date of the hearing, I think it clear that the Court had no right to enter upon the hearing and should have adjourned the case to enable the appellant to be present. To proceed in his absence was, in my opinion, error in law.\nA similar situation arose in England in the case of The King v. Dunleavey[1].\nSection 11(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, (1907),7 Edward VII, c.23, read as follows:\nAn appellant, notwithstanding that he is in custody, shall be entitled to be present, if he desires it, on the hearing of his appeal, except where the appeal is on some ground involving a question of law alone, but, in that case and on an application for leave to appeal and on any proceedings preliminary or incidental to an appeal, shall not be entitled to be present, except where rules of Court provide that he shall have the right to be present, or where the Court gives him leave to be present.\nThe appeal involved questions of fact. The prisoner was unable to be present owing to illness but had stated he desired to be present. The report at pages 200 and 201 reads as follows: F. T. Bingham, for the prisoner. Sect. 11, sub-s. 1, of the Criminal Appeal Act, 1907(1) appears to place a difficulty in the way of the appeal being heard in the absence of the prisoner who desires to be present, unless the Court think that the discretion of the prisoner as to whether he should be present passes to counsel. The presence of the prisoner would not aid the conduct of the appeal. The question is whether counsel can, on behalf of the prisoner, waive the right to be present.\nThe judgment of the Court (Lord Alverstone C.J. and Phillimore and Walton JJ.) was delivered by\nLord Alverstone, C.J.\u2014The case must stand over. Sect. 11, sub-s. 1, of the Criminal Appeal Act is imperative; the prisoner has a right to be present unless the ground of appeal is on law alone, and in the present case the appeal involves questions of fact.\nI agree with this decision and the case for the present appellant is even stronger as he was without counsel.\nUnder s. 600(1) of the Criminal Code this Court may on this appeal make any order that the Court of Appeal might have made. I have already expressed the view that the order it should have made was that the case should stand over to permit the appellant to be present.\nI would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal of June 23, 1964, and direct that the record be returned to that Court to set a date for the hearing and to hear and determine the application of the appellant in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Code.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: R. J. Carter, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the respondent: C. Powell, Toronto.\n[1] (1909), 1 K.B. 200, 1 Cr. App. R. 212.\n",

The county was responsible for her care under The Homes for the Aged Act, 1947 (Ont.), c. 46. Under an agreement between the County of Carleton and the County of Lanark, B was committed to an institution in the latter county at the expense of the former. B remained in this home until December 11, 1960, when she was removed to a home which had been constructed within the County of Carleton.\nThe annexation took effect on January 1, 1950, and by an agreement between the City of Ottawa and the Township of Gloucester the city assumed responsibility for welfare cases in that part of the township which was annexed. However, through an oversight, the case of B was not placed on a list of these cases and it was not until some time in December 1960 that the County of Carleton became aware that it had been paying for the maintenance of B from January 1, 1950, while throughout the whole of the period she had been a resident of that part of Gloucester which had become a part of Ottawa. The county took the position that the city was responsible for the payments made by the county on B\u2019s behalf from the date of annexation and for maintenance in the home established by the county for such time as she might be left there by the city. The city refused to acknowledge any responsibility for the maintenance or care of B or for the moneys paid out by the County of Carleton to the County of Lanark in the 10-year period from 1950 to 1960 nor for what it had cost to maintain B since December 1960 or would cost in the future. The county\u2019s claim was allowed by the trial judge. On appeal, the city was successful and the action was dismissed.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nThe county was responsible for the care of B prior to January 1, 1950, when the area in question was annexed by the city. The city by the act and fact of annexation and by the agreement between it and the township had assumed responsibility for the social service obligations of the county to the residents of the area annexed. The fact that one welfare case was inadvertently omitted from the list of such cases could not permit the city to escape the responsibility for that case. It was against conscience that it should do so. Brook\u2019s Wharf and Bull Wharf Ltd. v. Goodman Brothers, [1937] 1 K.B. 534; Fibrosa Spolka Akcyjna v.

Appeal allowed.\nMrs. Eileen M. Thomas, Q.C., and W.D. Baker, for the plaintiff, appellant. R.D. Jennings, Q.C., and James Reid, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nHALL J.:\u2014On January 1, 1950, the City of Ottawa annexed certain parts of the Township of Gloucester as well as the Township of Nepean, both areas being in the County of Carleton. The annexation was pursuant to an Order of the Ontario Municipal Board dated December 9, 1949, the opening paragraphs of which read:\nUpon the application of the Corporation of the City of Ottawa and of the Corporation of the Township of Gloucester in the presence of counsel for the Applicants, counsel for the Corporation of the County of Carleton, counsel for the Ottawa Public School Board, counsel for the Ottawa Separate School Board, counsel for Uplands Bus Line Limited, counsel for Eastview Bus Service Limited and counsel for certain owners of property within the area proposed to be annexed and of certain property owners and residents of the Township of Gloucester who appeared in person and upon reading By-law Number 138-49 of The Corporation of the City of Ottawa and By-law Number 46-49 of the Corporation of the Township of Gloucester, filed with the Board, authorizing this application and upon hearing evidence adduced at a public hearing held at Ottawa on Thursday, the 10th day of November, 1949 pursuant to notice given in accordance with the direction of the Board, and upon hearing what was alleged by counsel aforesaid and by the said property owners and residents.\nTHE BOARD ORDERS under and pursuant to section 23 of The Municipal Act (R.S.O. 1937, Chapter 266) (as re-enacted by O.S. 1939, Chapter 30, Section 2 and as amended and re-enacted by O.S. 1947, Chapter 69, Section 2) that that part of the Township of Gloucester described in Schedule \u201cA\u201d hereto be and the same is hereby annexed to the City of Ottawa.\nBy-law No. 138-49 of the Corporation of the City of Ottawa referred to above reads as follows:\nBY-LAW NUMBER 138-49\nA By-law of The Corporation of the City of Ottawa respecting annexation of part of the Township of Gloucester.\nThe Council of The Corporation of the City of Ottawa enacts as follows:\nAn application to The Ontario Municipal Board pursuant to section 23 of The Municipal Act (R.S.O. 1937, chapter 266 and amendments thereto) for an order annexing to the City of Ottawa on the 1st day of January, 1950, or on such other date as may be named by The Ontario Municipal Board or by Act of the Legislature of Ontario in accordance with the provisions of subsection 14 of said section 23, that part of the Township of Gloucester in the County of Carleton described as follows: (description follows).\nGIVEN under the Corporate Seal of the City of Ottawa this 3rd day of October, 1949. By-law No. 138-49 had been preceded by negotiations between the Corporation of the City of Ottawa and the Corporation of the Township of Gloucester. An agreement had been reached between the two corporations which was embodied in a Minute of the Ottawa City Council dated September 19, 1949, being Exhibit 11, which shows that the Council of the Corporation of the City of Ottawa approved of Report No. 23 of the Ottawa Board of Control, setting out the terms of the annexation about to be consummated. Exhibit 11 contains in part the following reference:\n10. Social Service:\nThe area of the Township under discussion does not present a particularly difficult or serious problem from the point of view of social service, the population being engaged chiefly in the three categories of civil servants, farmers and market gardeners. However, it is quite likely that expenditures under this heading, including payments to Children\u2019s Aid Society and other Institutional costs, will amount to approximately $55,000.00 per year, as compared to a 1948 expenditure in the Township of $22,364.34, to which would be added Children\u2019s Aid Society costs now payable through the County.\nIt may be pointed out that, generally speaking, the expansion of the City\u2014to the extent that it results in the construction of additional low cost housing\u2014will favorably influence the local social service problem.\nOn July 31, 1948, one Norah Baker, then 42 years of age who was an indigent person incapable of supporting herself because of imbecility, was a resident at Billings Bridge in the Township of Gloucester. She had been a resident there for the preceding seven or eight years. The Billings Bridge area was in that part of Gloucester Township annexed by the City of Ottawa as aforesaid. At that time, the County of Carleton was responsible for her care under The Homes for the Aged Act, 1947 (Ont.), c. 46. The County of Carleton, having no institution for indigents of its own, had entered into an agreement on December 27, 1904, whereby the Corporation of the County of Carleton was to be at liberty to send to the institution which had been established in the County of Lanark then known as a House of Refuge all poor and indigent persons of the County of Carleton and the Corporation of the County of Lanark undertook to receive all such persons so sent and to provide them with board, lodging and medical attendance of the same quality and extent as furnished to and for inmates received from the County of Lanark. The agreement provided that the Corporation of the County of Carleton should pay to the Corporation of the County of Lanark for the maintenance of any person so sent and so received. The agreement was renewed periodically and was in force at the time Norah Baker was committed to the institution. The name of the home was changed from House of Refuge to Home for the Aged by The Homes for the Aged Act, supra, but apart from changing the amount which was to be paid for the maintenance of an inmate there were no substantial changes in the basic agreement. Norah Baker became an inmate of the home in Lanark County and the County of Carleton was billed for her maintenance and the County of Carleton paid the County of Lanark the amounts billed as provided for in the said agreement. Norah Baker remained in the home until December 11, 1960, when she was removed to a home which had been constructed that year for the care of patients within the County of Carleton.\nAt the time of the annexation a list of the welfare cases contemplated by para. 10 of Exhibit 11 previously quoted was prepared by the solicitor for the County of Carleton and delivered to the solicitor for the City of Ottawa. No question arises as to any of these cases. The City of Ottawa assumed responsibility therefor pursuant to the said agreement. However, through an oversight, the case of Norah Baker was not on the list. It was overlooked that Norah Baker had come from the area in Gloucester Township which had been annexed by the City of Ottawa on January 1, 1950, and it was not until some time in December 1960 that the County of Carleton became aware that it had been paying for the maintenance of Norah Baker from January 1, 1950, while throughout the whole of the period she had been a resident of that part of the Township of Gloucester which had become a part of the City of Ottawa. On becoming aware of the true situation as to the residence of Norah Baker, the County of Carleton immediately notified the City of Ottawa and took the position that the City of Ottawa was responsible for the payments made by the County on her behalf from the date of annexation and for maintenance in the home established by the County for such time as she might be left there by the City of Ottawa. The City of Ottawa refused to acknowledge any responsibility for the maintenance or care of Norah Baker or for the moneys paid out by the County of Carleton to the County of Lanark in the 10-year period from 1950 to 1960 nor for what it has cost to maintain the said Norah Baker since December 1960 or will cost in the future.\nThe amounts claimed by the County of Carleton from the City of Ottawa totalling $9,833.01 for the period from January 1, 1950, until October 31, 1962, are not disputed and if the City of Ottawa is liable the County is entitled to judgment for the amount claimed plus the cost for care and maintenance subsequent to October 31,1962.\nIt appears to have been clearly established that as between the County of Carleton and the County of Lanark the County of Carleton was under contractual obligation to pay for the maintenance of Norah Baker throughout the period in issue here, namely, from January 1, 1950, until December 11, 1960, and it was established that for that period the County of Carleton paid to the County of Lanark $6,489.65.\nThe County of Carleton bases its claim against the City of Ottawa on the doctrine of restitution. Lord Wright in Brook\u2019s Wharf and Bull Wharf Ltd. v. Goodman Brothers[2] discussed this doctrine at p. 544 as follows:\nThe principle has been applied in a great variety of circumstances. Its application does not depend on privity of contract. Thus in Moule v. Garratt, L.R.7 Ex. 101, which I have just cited, it was held that the original lessee who had been compelled to pay for breach of a repairing covenant was entitled to recover the amount he had so paid from a subsequent assignee of the lease, notwithstanding that there had been intermediate assignees. In that case the liability of the lessee depended on the terms of his covenant, but the breach of covenant was due to the default of the assignee, and the payment by the lessee under legal compulsion relieved the assignee of his liability.\nThat class of case was discussed by Vaughan Williams L.J. in Bonner v. Tottenham and Edmonton Permanent Investment Building Society, [1899] 1 Q.B. 161, where Moule v. Garrett, L.R. 7 Ex. 101, was distinguished. The essence of the rule is that there is a liability for the same debt resting on the plaintiff and the defendant and the plaintiff has been legally compelled to pay, but the defendant gets the benefit of the payment, because his debt is discharged either entirely or pro tanto, whereas the defendant is primarily liable to pay as between himself and the plaintiff. The case is analogous to that of a payment by a surety which has the effect of discharging the principal\u2019s debt and which, therefore, gives a right of indemnity against the principal.\nAnd, at p. 545:\nThese statements of the principle do not put the obligation on any ground of implied contract or of constructive or national contract. The obligation is imposed by the Court simply under the circumstances of the case and on what the Court decides is just and reasonable, having regard to the relationship of the parties. It is a debt or obligation constituted by the act of the law, apart from any consent or intention of the parties or any privity of contract.\nAnd again in Fibrosa Spolka Akcyjna v. Fairbairn Lawson Combe Barbour Ltd.[3], at p. 61.\nLord Wright\u2019s statement in Fibrosa was approved by Cartwright J. in Deglman v. Guaranty Trust Company of Canada and Constantineau[4], where at p. 734 he quotes from Fibrosa as follows:\nIt is clear that any civilized system of law is bound to provide remedies for cases of what has been called unjust enrichment or unjust benefit, that is to prevent a man from retaining the money of or some benefit derived from another which it is against conscience that he should keep. Such remedies in English law are generically different from remedies in contract or in tort, and are now recognized to fall within a third category of the common law which has been called quasi-contract or restitution.\nAnd again:\nLord Mansfield does not say that the law implies a promise. The law implies a debt or obligation which is a different thing. In fact, he denies that there is a contract; the obligation is as efficacious as if it were upon a contract. The obligation is a creation of the law, just as much as an obligation in tort. The obligation belongs to a third class, distinct from either contract or tort though it resembles contract rather than tort.\nNorah Baker was an indigent for whose care the appellant was responsible prior to January 1, 1950, when the area in question was annexed by the respondent. The respondent by the act and fact of annexation and by the terms of said Exhibit 11, para. 10 assumed responsibility for the social service obligations of the appellant to the residents of the area annexed, and the fact that one welfare case was inadvertently omitted from the list cannot permit the respondent to escape the responsibility for that case. To paraphrase Lord Wright, it is against conscience that it should do so.\nI am in agreement with the conclusion reached by the learned trial judge that the appellant is entitled to recover from the respondent the sum of $9,833.01, being the amount claimed to October 31, 1962. The appellant is also entitled to recover from the respondent the cost of maintaining the said Norah Baker from November 1, 1962. If the parties are unable to agree on the amount payable for this period, there will be a reference to the Local Master at Ottawa to determine the amount payable. The appeal will, accordingly, be allowed and the judgment of Grant J. varied accordingly. The appellant is entitled to its costs here and in the Courts below.\nAppeal allowed with costs; judgment at trial varied.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Bell, Baker & Thompson, Ottawa.\nSolicitor for the defendant, respondent: D.V.

(Defendant) Respondent.\n1965: May 3, 4; 1965: May 25.\nPresent: Cartwright, Abbott, Martland, Judson and Hall JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR SASKATCHEWAN\nContracts\u2014Assignment of royalty interest under petroleum and natural gas lease and grant of minerals lease\u2014Plea of non est factum\u2014Claim to rescind on ground of innocent misrepresentation.\nCompanies\u2014Purchase of shares\u2014Failure to deliver prospectus\u2014Waiver of any right to have allotment of shares rescinded\u2014The Companies Act, R.S.S. 1940, c. 113, ss. 116(1) and 129.\nIn an action against the defendant company F, the plaintiff D sought a declaration that a certain agreement between them, which related to mines and minerals within, upon or under certain land owned by D, should be declared null and void or should be rescinded. Under the contract D assigned to F a 12 1\/2 per cent royalty payable to D under a lease to RB. He also granted to F a lease of all mines and minerals within, upon or under the land for a term of 99 years from the date of the contract which would be operative upon the termination, cancellation, avoidance or expiration of the RB lease. In return D was to receive from F 160 shares of its capital stock, of which one-half would be issued and allotted forthwith as consideration for the assignment of royalty, and one-half would be issued and allotted as consideration for the F lease when that lease took effect. It was also provided that F should pay to D 20 per cent of the benefits received by F from its disposition of gross royalty, or of minerals. The negotiations with D were conducted, on behalf of F, by one M. They had two short meetings, at the second of which M produced the contract. Although there was every opportunity for D to read the contract he did not do so, nor was it read over to him. Prior to its execution by D an explanation as to some of the contents of the document was given to him by M.\nThe trial judge, in deciding in favour of D, found that there had been unintentional misrepresentation by M both as to the nature and character of the contract and as to its contents. The misrepresentations as to the contents of the lease were in respect of three matters:( 1) that the document signed referred only to petroleum, natural gas and related hydrocarbons, whereas the proposed lease in fact included all mines and minerals; (2) that the plaintiff was assigning only 10 per cent of his royalty rights whereas he was in fact assigning the full (12 1\/2 per cent) royalty rights to the defendant; (3) that the lease to be granted was for a term of only 10 years, whereas it was in fact for a term of 99 years. The trial judge also held that the allotment of D's shares by F was void under The Companies Act, R.S.S. 1940, c. 113, because of non-compliance by F with s. 129 of that Act. The trial judgment having been reversed on appeal by the Court of Appeal, the plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe Court below was correct in its disagreement with the position taken by the trial judge that a confidential or fiduciary relationship existed between M and D, thus involving not merely a duty not to misrepresent, but a duty of complete disclosure of the contents of the contract. The plea of non est factum failed. There was no misrepresentation as to the nature of the document which D was asked to sign. It was admitted that he was aware that he was disposing of his royalty under the RB lease and that he was granting, subject to that lease, a further lease to F.\nThe claim to rescind on the ground of innocent misrepresentation also failed because, accepting D's own evidence, the three misrepresentations found by the trial judge were not substantiated.\nSection 116(1) of The Companies Act, supra, required the company to furnish every person invited by the prospectus to purchase securities offered by it with a copy when the invitation was issued. Section 129 dealt not with the requirement for delivery of prospectuses to individuals, but with the requirement that upon the issue of a form of application or subscription for corporate securities offered to the public a prospectus duly filed under s. 114 or s. 131 be issued with it. The failure of M to furnish a prospectus to D may have been a breach of s. 116(1), but was not a breach of s. 129.\nThe failure to comply with s. 116(1), at the most, might render a purchase of shares voidable by the purchaser. Even if D had the right to avoid his share purchase, he could not exercise it when he purported to do so because, having entered into the contract on August 3, 1950, and having received his share certificate in the following year, he took no step to repudiate until June 21, 1956, and, in the meantime had been in receipt of communications sent to him as a shareholder by F, and had attended and voted at two annual meetings. This was ample evidence of his election to retain the shares, and of his waiver of any right to have the allotment of shares to him rescinded. APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[1], allowing an appeal from a judgment of Davis J. Appeal dismissed.\nC. R. Davidson, Q.C., for the plaintiff, appellant.\nE. J. Moss and S. J. Cameron, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014This case involves a claim made by the appellant (hereinafter referred to as \"Dorsch\") against the respondent (hereinafter referred to as \"Freeholders\") seeking a declaration that a certain agreement made between them, dated August 3, 1950, (hereinafter referred to as \"the contract\"), which related to mines and minerals within, upon or under the South East Quarter of Section 7, Township 7, Range 13, West of the 2nd Meridian, in the Province of Saskatchewan (hereinafter referred to as \"the land\"), owned by Dorsch, should be declared null and void, or should be rescinded. The learned trial judge granted a declaration that the contract was null and void. This judgment was reversed on appeal by unanimous decision of the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan[2].\nOn April 29, 1949, Dorsch entered into a petroleum and natural gas lease with one Bandy Lee in respect of the land. This lease is referred to hereafter as \"the Rio Bravo lease\". It was for a term of ten years and so long thereafter as the leased substances, or any of them, were produced from the land. Lee assigned his interest under the lease to Rio Bravo Oil Company Limited. The only clause which has particular significance is that dealing with the royalty payable in respect of oil:\nOn oil, one-eighth of that produced and saved from the said lands, the same to be delivered at the wells or to the credit of the Lessor into the pipe line to which the wells may be connected; the Lessee may from time to time purchase any royalty oil in its possession, paying the market price therefor prevailing for the field where produced on the date of purchase;\nUnder the contract Dorsch assigned to Freeholders the royalty payable under the Rio Bravo lease. He also granted to Freeholders a lease of all mines and minerals within, upon or under the land for a term of 99 years from the date of the contract which would be operative upon the termination, cancellation, avoidance or expiration of the Rio Bravo lease. This lease to Freeholders was renewable by it at its option and was to continue so long as the minerals or any of them were produced from the land. It is hereinafter referred to as \"the Freeholders lease\".\nIn consideration for his covenants under the contract Dorsch was to receive from Freeholders 160 shares of its capital stock, with a par value of one dollar each, fully paid and non-assessable, of which one-half would be issued and allotted forthwith as consideration for the assignment of royalty, and one-half would be issued and allotted as consideration for the Freeholders lease when that lease took effect.\nThe contract also provided, in clause 5, that:\nThe GRANTEE shall have the full and absolute right to deal with, or dispose of the gross royalty hereby assigned or any part thereof, and\/or the said minerals or any of them, as the case may be, PROVIDED that the GRANTEE shall pay to the GRANTOR twenty percent. (20%) of the benefits received by the GRANTEE from any such disposition whether the same consist of a cash consideration or a royalty interest under a drilling lease, or otherwise.\nDorsch is a farmer who, at the time of the trial, was farming 800 acres of land in Saskatchewan. He had a Grade 9 education. The negotiations with him were conducted, on behalf of Freeholders, by Charles Markle who then, and at the time of the trial, was secretary-treasurer of the Rural Municipality of Weyburn. They had two short meetings at the municipal office. On the occasion of the second meeting Markle produced the contract. Dorsch did not read it, nor was it read over to him. He testified that there was every opportunity for him to read it.\nPrior to its execution by Dorsch an explanation as to some of the contents of the document was given to him by Markle. It is contended on behalf of Dorsch that there were misrepresentations made by Markle, but Dorsch conceded in evidence that such misrepresentations as he alleged were not the result of fraud on Markle's part, but were caused by Markle's lack of understanding of the contract. It was contended on behalf of Dorsch that this resulted from the giving of erroneous instructions by Freeholders to Markle.\nBoth men were found by the learned trial judge to be honest witnesses. In his opinion Dorsch had more reason to remember the events leading up to the execution of the contract than Markle, who had handled some eighty like transactions. He found that there was little conflict between them, but did find that there had been unintentional misrepresentation by Markle both as to the nature and character of the contract and as to its contents.\nOn March 30, 1951, Freeholders filed a caveat against the land to give notice of its interest in the land. On August 17, 1951, Freeholders issued a share certificate in the name of Dorsch for eighty shares in its capital stock, which was received by Dorsch.\nDorsch attended and voted at the annual general meetings of Freeholders on November 27, 1952, and November 20,1953. An admission to this effect, as well as to his having nominated a director, was filed at the trial. Dorsch was permitted by the learned trial judge to withdraw the admission as to the nomination, after his own evidence had been given, but the other admissions remained. Dorsch did not deny any of the admissions. He was not recalled in rebuttal.\nOn April 28, 1956, a well was spudded in on the land, which, on completion, was an oil producing well. A second producing well was drilled on the land the following year.\nOn May 22, 1956, a notice of repudiation of the contract, signed by Dorsch, was sent by his solicitor to Freeholders, along with his share certificate. Freeholders, by letter to Dorsch's solicitor, dated June 21, 1956, returned the certificate and advised that the company had no intention of accepting the repudiation.\nDorsch testified that he had never received a prospectus from Freeholders in respect of the shares in that company, for which, in the contract, he had applied as consideration for the assignment of royalties and for the lease of the land to Freeholders. The contract, which he had executed under seal, contained an acknowledgement of receipt of a prospectus by him. Markle's evidence was that he was instructed to issue a prospectus with the document, i.e., the form of contract. He did so in some instances, as often as he had a supply of them. He could not say whether or not Dorsch received one.\nSubsequent to the production of oil being obtained from the land, Dorsch received payments representing one-fifth of the royalty payable in respect of production by the lessee to the lessor under the terms of the Rio Bravo lease.\nBefore dealing with the misrepresentations which the learned trial judge found to have been made by Markle to Dorsch, it would be desirable to consider the meaning and effect of clause 5 of the contract, previously quoted.\nThat clause gave to Freeholders the right to deal with or dispose of the gross royalty assigned to it, and also to deal with or dispose of \"the said minerals\", which must refer back to the Freeholders lease, which would only take effect after the Rio Bravo lease terminated.\nIn so far as the gross royalty under the Rio Bravo lease is concerned, it has already been noted that, as to oil, the royalty was due in kind, but with an option to the lessee to purchase the lessor's share of the oil produced. The sale of that oil to the lessee was a disposition of gross royalty by Freeholders.\nClause 5 of the contract provides that Freeholders should pay to Dorsch 20 per cent of the benefits received by Freeholders from its disposition of gross royalty, or of minerals. In my opinion Freeholders was obligated to pay Dorsch 20 per cent of the gross royalties received by it, and that obligation it recognized and performed. Furthermore, if Freeholders' lease came into operation, whether it undertook drilling and production itself, or assigned its rights to another, it would be compelled to account to Dorsch for 20 per cent of the benefits which it received from the disposition of the minerals from the land, whether those benefits took the form of net proceeds from the sale of production from its own wells, a stipulated royalty reserved on the assignment of its rights, or a cash consideration for such assignment.\nThe learned trial judge found that there had been misrepresentation by Markle to Dorsch in respect of the contents of the lease in respect of three matters, which are summarized by Hall J. A., who delivered the judgment of the Court of Appeal, as follows:\n(1) that the document signed referred only to petroleum, natural gas and related hydrocarbons, whereas the proposed lease in fact included all mines and minerals; (2) that the respondent was assigning only ten percent of his royalty rights whereas he was in fact assigning the full [12 1\/2 per cent] royalty rights to the appellant;\n(3) that the lease to be granted was for a term of only ten years, whereas it was in fact for a term of ninety-nine years.\nIn view of the opinion I have formed as to the meaning of clause 5 of the contract, there can be no basis for finding that there was misrepresentation in respect of the second item. It is true that under the contract Dorsch assigned to Freeholders his 12 1\/2 per cent royalty under the Rio Bravo lease, but Freeholders had to account to him for one-fifth of that. In the net result Freeholders only received for its own use a 10 per cent gross royalty.\nWith respect to the first item mentioned it is clear that there was no active representation by Markle in relation to the Freeholders lease as covering only petroleum, natural gas and related hydrocarbons. Dorsch himself, on examination for discovery, said:\nQ. You say that you understood that the lease which would arise after the expiration of the Rio Bravo lease would be a lease of oil and gas only and not of all minerals? A. Yes.\nQ. Did Mr. Markle tell you that? A. He didn't tell me anything in that respect.\nQ. You just assumed that? A. I assumed it because that is what we were talking about, we were talking about oil.\nThe case for Dorsch, on this point, was based solely upon non-disclosure.\nThe same applies to item 3. There was no representation by Markle as to the term of the lease to Freeholders. Dorsch assumed that it would be for ten years. In answer to a question by the learned trial judge, referring to the discussions between Markle and himself, Dorsch said:\nNo, he didn't say anything about the\u2014I took it for granted it was a ten year lease because I never heard of a 99 year lease.\nThe position taken by the learned trial judge was that a confidential or fiduciary relationship existed between Markle and Dorsch, thus involving not merely a duty not to misrepresent, but a duty of complete disclosure of the contents of the contract. With respect to this, I agree with what is said by Hall J.A. in the Court below:\nThe respondent had gone as far as Grade Nine in school and was able to read. He said that he did not read the document before signing it, although he had every opportunity to do so. He glanced at it but did not read it because he did not think he would be capable of understanding it. He says that he relied on Markle to explain to him what was in the document. The learned trial judge found that Markle undertook to explain the document to the respondent. It would appear from the respondent's evidence, however, that it was only the general outline of the scheme or proposal rather than the details of the document which Markle undertook to explain. The document was not produced until the second discussion and then only after the respondent had consented to sign. It was then presented to the respondent who did not ask for it to be read over to him. At no time was it suggested that the respondent informed Markle that he did not think he would understand the document, or that he was not going to read it, or that he relied upon Markle to explain it to him. There is nothing to indicate that Markle was ever aware that the respondent did not read the document or did not understand. There was no conduct on the part of Markle which would prevent or discourage the respondent from reading it. I therefore cannot agree with the trial judge when he holds that Markle placed himself in a position of trust or that a confidential or fiduciary relationship existed between Markle and the respondent.\nIn view of the foregoing, it is clear that the plea of non est factum must fail. There was clearly no misrepresentation as to the nature of the document which Dorsch was asked to sign. It is admitted that he was aware that he was disposing of his royalty under the Rio Bravo lease and that he was granting, subject to that lease, a further lease to Freeholders.\nThe claim to rescind on the ground of innocent misrepresentation must also fail because, in my opinion, accepting Dorsch's own evidence, the three misrepresentations found by the learned trial judge are not substantiated.\nThe other ground upon which the learned trial judge decided in favour of Dorsch was that the allotment of his shares by Freeholders was void under The Companies Act, R.S.S. 1940, c. 113 (the statute applicable at the relevant time), because of non-compliance by Freeholders with s. 129 of that Act.\nThe relevant provisions of that statute are as follows:\n3.\u2014(1) In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires, the expression:\n15. \"Prospectus\" means any prospectus, notice, circular, advertisement or other document inviting the public to subscribe for or purchase, or offering to the public for subscription or purchase, any shares or debentures of a company or an intended company;\n***\n116.\u2014(1) The company shall furnish every person who is invited to subscribe for any shares or debentures offered by the prospectus with a copy of the prospectus at the time when the invitation is made.\n***\n125. An allotment made by a company:\n(a) to an applicant or allottee in contravention of the provisions of section 34 or 35 shall be voidable at the instance of the applicant within two months after the holding of the statutory meeting of the company and not later;\n(b) in contravention of section 122 or 124 shall be void;\n(c) upon an application in contravention of section 129 shall be void; and every such allotment as is mentioned in clauses (a) and (c) shall be voidable or void, as the case may be, notwithstanding that the company is in course of being wound up.\n***\n129.\u2014(1) It shall not be lawful to issue any form of application or subscription for shares in or debentures of a company offered to the public unless the form is issued with a prospectus filed under section 114 or 131:\nProvided that this section shall not apply if it is shown that the form of application was issued either:\n(a) in connection with a bona fide invitation to a person to enter into an underwriting agreement with respect to the shares or debentures; or\n(b) in relation to the shares in or debentures of a company where there is no offer to the public; or\n(c) to existing members or debenture holders of a company, whether an applicant for shares or debentures had or had not the right to renounce in favour of other persons.\n(2) Every person who acts in contravention of this section shall, without prejudice to any other liability, be guilty of an offence.\n(The italics in subs. (1) are my own.)\nBoth the Courts below held that there had been a breach of s. 129. The Court of Appeal held, however, that, notwithstanding this, subsequent to the allotment, on the basis of Dorsch's subsequent conduct, a new independent contract to accept the shares could be presumed.\nThe sections which I have quoted (other than s. 3) appear in that portion of the Act which is entitled \"Prospectuses\". Section 114, the first of the sections under that heading, requires that every prospectus shall be dated and such date, in the absence of proof to the contrary, shall be taken as the date of issue of the prospectus. A signed copy is required to be filed with the registrar.\nSection 115 contains the requirements as to what is to be stated in a prospectus.\nSection 116(1), quoted above, requires the company to furnish every person invited by the prospectus to purchase securities offered by it with a copy when the invitation is made.\nSection 116 was introduced into The Companies Act as a new provision, in 1933, and s. 129 was similarly introduced at the same time (1933 (Sask.), c. 21). Obviously, they were not intended to cover identical ground. The difference in their wording, in my opinion, indicates the difference of application of each of them.\nSection 116(1) requires that each person invited to subscribe for corporate securities offered by a prospectus should receive a copy of it.\nSection 129 is dealing, not with the requirement for delivery of prospectuses to individuals, but with the requirement that upon the issue of a form of application or subscription for corporate securities offered to the public a prospectus duly filed under s. 114 or s. 131 be issued with it. The situation which this section contemplates is, on an offer to the public of corporate securities, the publication and putting into circulation by the company, or by an underwriter, of application or subscription forms. If this is done, then the required form of prospectus, duly filed, must also be published and put into circulation with it. Otherwise, under s. 125 (c), an allotment made pursuant to such an application would be void.\nIn my opinion, what is declared to be unlawful in this section is the issue by or on behalf of a company of any application or subscription form for its shares, unless there is issued at the same time a prospectus filed in conformity with the provision of the Act. Section 116 then applies so as to require that a copy of such prospectus be furnished to each individual who is invited to subscribe for such securities.\nIn the present case Freeholders complied with s. 129, as it did file and issue the required form of prospectus. Copies were supplied to Markle, who was instructed by Freeholders to give a copy to each person who agreed to take Freeholders' shares, as is shown by the receipt embodied in the contract. His failure to furnish one to Dorsch may have been a breach of s. 116(1), but was not a breach of s. 129.\nWhat is the consequence of a failure to comply with s. 116(1)? Section 125, which deals with the effect of the contravention of certain sections of the Act in rendering an allotment of shares void or voidable, makes no reference to s. 116. In my opinion, at the most, it might render a purchase of shares voidable by the purchaser. Even if Dorsch had the right to avoid his share purchase, he could not exercise it when he purported to do so because, having entered into the contract on August 3, 1950, and having received his share certificate in the following year, he took no step to repudiate until June 21, 1956, and, in the meantime, had been in receipt of communications sent to him as a shareholder by Freeholders, and had attended and voted at two annual meetings. This, in my opinion, is ample evidence of his election to retain the shares, and of his waiver of any right to have the allotment of shares to him rescinded.\nIn view of my conclusion as to the meaning of s. 129 of The Companies Act, it is unnecessary for me to express an opinion with respect to the respondent's submission that, for the reasons set forth in the judgment of Wynn-Parry J., in Government Stock and Other Securities Investment Co. Ltd. v. Christopher1, s. 129 is inapplicable in relation to an issue of shares to be allotted for a consideration other than money, and to the members of a restricted class, i.e., owners of mineral rights, and not to the public at large.\nFor the foregoing reasons, I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Davidson, Davidson & Neill, Regina.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Moss & Wimmer, Regina.\n[1] (1964), 48 W.W.R. 257, 45 D.L.R.

G R was a director and president and was the sole beneficial owner of all the issued shares in the said R Ltd. E R had been such sole beneficial owner but had transferred his shares to G R and at all relevant times was neither a director nor shareholder of R Ltd.\nThe action was dismissed at trial and an appeal from the judgment of the trial judge was dismissed in the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal. In this Court counsel for the appellant took the position that he was not alleging that the transaction in question was ulta vires the real estate company but on the other hand admitted that the transaction was one which could bind the company if it had been unanimously approved by the shareholders in a meeting duly called for such purpose.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nWhen a matter was intra vires of a corporation, the corporation could not be heard to deny a transaction to which all the shareholders had given their assent even when such assent was given in an informal manner or by conduct as distinguished from a formal resolution at a duly convened meeting. Since G R not only assented to the transaction but instigated it, his assent, being that of the sole beneficial shareholder, therefore bound the company.

Garrow, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nC.F.H. Carson, Q.C., and Allan Findlay, Q.C., for the defendant, respondent.\nA.J.C. O\u2019Marra, Q.C., for the third parties, respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nSPENCE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1 pronounced on March 16, 1964, affirming the judgment at trial pronounced on March 15, 1963.\nThe action was brought by the appellant as trustee in bankruptcy of Ridout Real Estate Limited to recover from the respondent bank certain sums realized by the bank from assets which the said company had pledged to the bank as security for a loan to one George H. Ridout and his brother Ernest Ridout.\nGeorge Ridout was a director and president and was the sole beneficial owner of all the issued shares in the said Ridout Real Estate Limited. Ernest Ridout had been such sole beneficial owner but had transferred his shares to George Ridout and at all relevant times was neither a director nor shareholder of the Ridout Real Estate company.\nOn July 18, 1955, the said Ernest Ridout arranged with an officer of the defendant bank that it should loan to George Ridout and to him the sum of $100,000 for the purpose of permitting the said Ernest Ridout to obtain a release of his guarantee of the bonds of Taylor Forbes Limited which were then in default. As security for the loan, the bank was given a hypothecation of eleven promissory notes made by the Irmac Construction Company Limited in favour of Ridout Real Estate Limited and an assignment of the interest of Ridout Real Estate Limited in a partnership known as the Town and Country Development. One McIntosh, the supervisor of the Toronto branches of the respondent bank, was directed to carry out the transaction on behalf of the bank.\nOn the next day, July 19, 1955, Mr. McIntosh met Ernest Ridout and talked over the matter arranging for completion of certain documents which the bank required. After lunch, on the same day, Mr. McIntosh met, by appointment, Miss M.E. MacDonald, who delivered to him an envelope containing the following documents:\n(1) Note for $95,000 signed by George Ridout and Ernest Ridout.\n(2) Assignment of the interest of Ridout Real Estate Limited in Town and Country Development, executed on behalf of the Ridout company by George Ridout and bearing the corporate seal.\n(3) Copy of a resolution authorizing the Ridout company to assign its interest in Town and Country Development as security and authorizing George Ridout to sign the assignment, certified by Miss M.E. MacDonald under the Ridout company\u2019s seal, to be a true copy of a resolution of the board of directors of the Ridout company, passed at a meeting of directors on July 19, 1955.\n(4) Hypothecation Agreement executed on behalf of the Ridout company by George Ridout and Miss M.E. MacDonald under the seal of the Ridout company, by which hypothecation agreement Ridout Real Estate Limited hypothecated \u201call notes, cheques, drafts and other bills of exchange now lodged and\/or which may hereafter be lodged with the bank and any resultant proceeds\u201d.\n(5) Copy of a resolution authorizing the Ridout company to pledge the eleven Irmac notes of $10,000 each, and authorizing George Ridout to sign such hypothecation, certified by Miss MacDonald under the seal of the Ridout company to be a true copy of a resolution of the board of directors of the Ridout company, passed at a meeting of the directors.\n(6) Direction from George Ridout requesting the bank to issue the cheque for $100,000 to M.H Roebuck.\n(7) The eleven notes of the Irmac company.\n(8) Cheque of the Ridout company in favour of the Bank of Nova Scotia for $5,000 signed by George Ridout and Miss M.E. MacDonald.\nMr. McIntosh was familiar with the signatures of George Ridout and Ernest Ridout and was satisfied with their signatures on the document. Miss MacDonald represented that she was the secretary of Ridout Real Estate and was entitled under the by-laws to execute the said documents. She was not such secretary but she was the head office manager and was a signing officer of the Ridout company in connection with its business with its ordinary bank which was not the respondent. The secretary-treasurer of the company was one Mr. Muir who was then absent on holidays.\nThe first three Irmac notes becoming due in August, September and October, were paid and were credited against the loan of $95,000, that is, the $100,000 less the $5,000 cheque.\nIn November 1955, $45,000 was received in respect of the Ridout Real Estate interests in the Town and Country Development and the respondent bank was also paid a cheque of the Ridout Real Estate Limited for $10,000. This cheque was signed by George Ridout and Mr. Muir. These payments reduced the loan to $10,000. The bank then made a further advance of $70,000 to George Ridout and took another promissory note signed by George Ridout and Ernest Ridout for that amount. This increased the total loan to $80,000 and the bank issued a cheque for the amount of $70,000 to George Ridout who deposited it to the credit of the trust account of Ridout Real Estate Limited in its regular bank. The loan in the sum of $80,000 was discharged by applying against it the proceeds from the eight Irmac notes, and the final payment was on June 5, 1956.\nOn December 1, 1956, Ernest Ridout deposited to the credit of the trust account of the Ridout company in its regular bank the sum of $58,416.25. A receiving order was made on January 3, 1957. The appellant was appointed trustee in bankruptcy of Ridout Real Estate Limited.\nThe appellant commenced this action by a writ issued on June 3, 1959.\nAt trial, the action was dismissed by King J. and the appeal from the judgment of the learned trial judge was dismissed in the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nIn this Court, able argument was made by counsel for both the appellant and the respondent bank, counsel for the third parties adopting the latter argument. Counsel for the appellant took the firm position that he was not alleging that the transaction was ultra vires the real estate company but on the other hand admitted that the transaction was one which could bind the company if it had been unanimously approved by shareholders in meeting duly called for such purpose.\nIt is admitted that no resolution of directors was passed and that no meeting of directors took place. However, the \u201cinside management rule\u201d enunciated inter alia in The Royal British Bank v. Turquand[2], would apply to protect an innocent third party dealing with Ridout Real Estate Ltd\u00bb without notice of those facts and that Miss MacDonald was not the secretary of the company.\nIn the Court of Appeal for Ontario, Schroeder J.A. said:\nSince I have come to the decision that the doctrine of estoppel operates in favour of the defendant it follows that I also take the view that the defendant comes within the protection of the principle of The Royal British Bank v. Turquand (1856), 6 E1 & B1. 327, and William Augustus Mahony v. The East Holyford Mining Company (Limited) (1875), L.R. 7 H.L. 869.\nI have come to the conclusion that, in this Court, it is not necessary to investigate whether the respondent bank is entitled to rely on the \u201cinside management rule\u201d. Whether or not it were able to do so, it is plain that the transactions were not only approved by the sole beneficial owner but he was the chief instigator of the transactions and directed them throughout. It is true that no meeting of shareholders was ever held to approve the transactions. If there had been a directors\u2019 meeting, fully attended, the directors were George Ridout, Mr. Muir and two other employees. None of the latter three held any shares beneficially, and all were mere nominees of George Ridout. Therefore, the result of either the shareholders\u2019 meeting or the directors\u2019 meeting would have been a foregone conclusion. If any director had seen fit to oppose George Ridout\u2019s wishes, he could be removed from his position as director with the utmost celerity and, of course, George Ridout was the sole beneficial owner of all the shares and his wishes would have been the unanimous decision of the shareholders\u2019 meeting.\nUnder these circumstances, the problem of what kind of unanimous authorization of shareholders is sufficient becomes important. In re George Newman & Co.[3], in the Court of Appeal, the chairman of a company in which substantially all the shares were held by him and his family, purchased on behalf of the company, the right to a building agreement. Upon the vendor\u2019s objection to accepting the company as a tenant, the chairman sold the benefit of the agreement to the company at an advance of \u00a310,000 of which \u00a37,000 was spent on commissions and otherwise to obtain the agreement and \u00a33,000 was applied by the chair\u00bb man for his own use. A further sum of \u00a33,500 was spent by the chairman out of the assets of the company upon his private home. These payments were made out of money borrowed by the company for the purpose of the business. They were sanctioned by resolutions of the directors and were approved by all the shareholders. Held, that the chairman was liable for the \u00a33,000 out of the purchase price, which he devoted to his own use, and the \u00a33,500 which he took from the company\u2019s coffers for repairs to his own home. Held, that there was no power in the shareholders to authorize the making of \u201cpresents to directors out of the money borrowed by the company\u201d and if there had been such a power it could only be exercised by general meeting. Lindley J. delivered the judgment of the Court and at p. 685 said:\nBut in this case the presents made by the directors to Mr. Newman, their chairman, were made out of money borrowed by the company for the purposes of its business; and this money the directors had no right to apply in making presents to one of themselves. The transaction was a breach of trust by the whole of them; and even if all the shareholders could have sanctioned it, they never did so in such a way as to bind the company. It is true that this company was a small one, and is what is called a private company; but its corporate capacity cannot be ignored. Those who form such companies obtain great advantages, but accompanied by some disadvantages. A registered company cannot do anything which all its members think expedient, and which, apart from the law relating to incorporated companies, they might lawfully do. An incorporated company\u2019s assets are its property and not the property of the shareholders for the time being; and, if the directors misapply those assets by applying them to purposes for which they cannot be lawfully applied by the company itself, the company can make them liable for such misapplication as soon as any one properly sets the company in motion\u2026 Directors have no right to be paid for their services and cannot pay themselves or each other, or make presents to themselves out of the company\u2019s assets, unless authorized so to do by the instrument which regulates the company or by the shareholders at a properly convened meeting\u2026 But to make presents out of profits is one thing and to make them out of capital or out of money borrowed by the company is a very different matter. Such money cannot be lawfully divided amongst the shareholders themselves, nor can it be given away by them for nothing to their directors so as to bind the company in its corporate capacity. But even if the shareholders in general meeting could have sanctioned the making of these presents, no general meeting to consider the subject was ever held. It may be true, and probably is true, that a meeting, if held, would have done anything which Mr George Newman desired; but this is pure speculation, and the liquidator, as representing the company in its corporate capacity, is entitled to insist upon and to have the benefit of the fact that even if a general meeting could have sanctioned what was done, such sanction was never obtained. Individual assents given separately may preclude those who give them from complaining of what they have sanctioned; but for the purpose of binding a company in its corporate capacity individual assents given separately are not equivalent to the assent of a meeting. The company is entitled to the protection afforded by a duly convened meeting, and by a resolution properly considered and carried and duly recorded.\n(The italicizing is my own.)\nIt will be seen, therefore, that Lindley J. finds in favour of the liquidator on two grounds. Firstly, that the transaction was ultra vires of the company and could not be validated even by a vote of the shareholders at a meeting, and, secondly, that even if they were not ultra vires and could have been validated by such a vote, there must be a meeting and a vote, not a mere approval by individual shareholders.\nRe Salomon v. Salomon & Co.[4] in the House of Lords. This case turned on the recognition of the corporate identity as distinguished from the identity of the owner of all shares except qualifying shares. But at p. 57, Lord Davey said this:\nNor was the absence of any independent board material in a case like the present. I think it an inevitable inference from the circumstances of the case that every member of the company assented to the purchase, and the company is bound in a matter intra vires by the unanimous agreement of its members. In fact, it is impossible to say who was defrauded.\nAs pointed out by counsel for the appellant, there was in fact a meeting. See Broderip v. Salomon[5], per Kay L.J. at p. 343, where he said:\nThe proceedings were faultless in point of form\u00bb On August 2, 1892, all the seven shareholders\u2014i.e., Mr. Salomon, his wife and children\u2014held a general meeting of the company. They appointed Mr. Salomon and two of his sons directors, and these directors appointed Salomon managing director with a salary of \u00a3500 a year, and two of the sons to other offices with \u00a3148 a year each. They formally adopted the agreement of July 20, and agreed with the nominal trustee to take over the property on the terms arranged with him. The same day seven shares were allotted to the seven subscribers to the memorandum.\n(The italicizing is my own.) However, Lord Davey\u2019s statement quoted above, supra, makes no reference to a meeting and it would seem to be a simple statement that in intra vires transactions a bare assent by all shareholders is sufficient to validate a transaction as against a company. As I shall show, that view has been taken of Lord Davey\u2019s statement in later cases.\nThe Attorney-General for the Dominion of Canada v. The Standard Trust Company of New York[6]. There, four members of a syndicate purchased the outstanding bonds which were in default of a company known as the Montreal and Sorel Railway Company. The four members then incorporated a company and each of the four subscribed $75,000, i.e., a total of $300,000, being all the issued shares of the company. They then sold to this company (the South Shore Railway Company) the whole of the assets of the Montreal and Sorel Railway Company of which they had taken possession as bond-holders, for $648,000. Of that sum, $300,000 was paid by paying the money subscribed by the four members for the shares and the company acknowledged an indebtedness to the four members of the balance of $348,000. There had been a meeting of the shareholders of the new company (the South Shore Railway Company) at which the directors who were these four members of the syndicate and their three nominees, were authorized to enter into agreements with railway companies and other persons in accordance with the provisions of the Act which had incorporated the company. Shortly thereafter, a meeting of the board of directors agreed to transfer the railway enterprise to the South Shore Railway Company at a purchase price to be settled at a later period. Some three months thereafter, the directors fixed the sale price at $648,000. Viscount Haldane, giving judgment for the Judicial Committee, said at p. 504:\nIf, therefore, what the directors did is to be impeached, it must be on the ground, not of its having been ultra vires of the company, but of its having been a breach of duty by the directors. Now, although, the capital of the company was $1,000,000, the only stock issued was to the amount of $300,000, and this was taken up and owned by the members of the syndicate and no one else. They and they alone were interested in the capital of the company. This is not a case of winding up, but even if it were, it would make no difference. In proceedings of the character of the present the title of a liquidator as representing creditors cannot be higher than the title of the company against whom the creditors claim. In this case the interests of the company and of the syndicate were identical. The only persons beneficially interested in the company were the four members of the syndicate. The law gave them the complete control of its action. Under that control the company gave effect to the policy of the only persons who had any beneficial interest in its capital. The case is not one in which the apparent procedure can be said to have been unreal, or to have been a cloak under which a conspiracy to defraud was concealed. Under these circumstances, their Lordships are of opinion that the company, notwithstanding that no general meeting, apart from the meeting of directors, appears to have been held for the purpose, was completely bound by the transactions sought to be impeached, and that the appellant, who has certainly no title higher than that of the company against the assets of which he claims, is bound likewise.\nViscount Haldane cites Salomon v. Salomon in the House of Lords, supra.\nIt will be seen, therefore, that this is an example of a unanimous approval of shareholders where there has been no meeting of shareholders to approve the actual transactions. The shareholders had in meeting, approved generally the entering into of agreements to purchase railways, but the actual agreement to purchase this particular railway and the purchase price at which it had been purchased was made by the action of the directors alone. Those directors were, or represented, all of the shareholders. The case would seem to be of close application to the present.\nIn re Express Engineering Works Limited[7]. This was a decision of the Court of Appeal. Here, a syndicate of five persons formed a private company of which they were the sole shareholders, and they sold to that private company for \u00a315,000 in debentures property which they had a few days previously purchased for \u00a37,000. The contract for sale and the issue of the debentures for payment was determined upon at a meeting of the same five persons described as a directors\u2019 meeting. At the same meeting, they appointed themselves directors. The articles of the company prohibited a director voting in respect of any contract or arrangement in which he might be interested. In an action by the liquidator for a declaration that the issue and transfer of the debentures were invalid and should be set aside, Astbury J. dismissed the action on the ground that every member of the company having assented to the transaction, the company was bound in a matter intra vires by the unanimous agreement of its members. On appeal, Lord Sterndale, M.R., noting that the appellants relied on In re George Newman & Co., supra, said at p. 470:\nThere were, however, two differences between that case and the present one. First, the transaction there was ultra vires, and, secondly, in that case there never was a meeting of the corporators. In the present case these five persons were all the corporators of the company and they did all meet, and did all agree that these debentures should be issued. Therefore it seems that the case came within the meaning of what was said by Lord Davey in Salomon v. Salomon & Co., [1897] A.C. 22, 57.\n\u201cI think it an inevitable inference from the circumstances of the case that every member of the company assented to the purchase, and the company is bound in a matter intra vires by the unanimous agreement of its members.\u201d\nIt is true that a different question was there under discussion, but I am of opinion that this case falls within what Lord Davey said. It was said here that the meeting was a directors\u2019 meeting, but it might well be considered a general meeting of the company, for although it was referred to in the minutes as a board meeting, yet if the five persons present had said, \u201cWe will now constitute this a general meeting\u201d, it would have been within their powers to do so, and it appears to me that that was in fact what they did. The appeal must therefore be dismissed.\nThis case stands for the validating effect of the approval of all shareholders and limits the In re Newman doctrine to ultra vires transactions. It seems, however, to stress the necessity of a meeting and simply excused an irregularity, i.e., the failure to designate the meeting as that of shareholders rather than directors. Of course, the directors, as such, could not validly make the agreement as they were interested parties.\nIn re Oxted Motor Company, Limited[8] was an appeal before Lush and Greer JJ. from the decision of a County Court judge. In this case, there were only two shareholders and the two shareholders were the sole directors. The two shareholders met and passed a resolution that the company should be wound up voluntarily. There had been no notice of intention to propose an extraordinary resolution to such effect given to the shareholders and s. 182(3) of the Companies (Consolidation) Act, 1908, provided:\nA company may be wound up voluntarily\u2014* * * (3) if the company resolves by extraordinary resolution to the effect that it cannot by reason of its liabilities continue its business, and that it is advisable to wind up. And by s. 69(1):\nA resolution shall be an extraordinary resolution when it has been passed by a majority of not less than three-fourths of such members entitled to vote as are present in person or by proxy\u2026 at a general meeting of which notice specifying the intervention to propose the resolution as an extraordinary resolution has been duly given.\nLush J. said at p. 37:\nIt is contended that unless the notice contemplated by that section has been given a resolution is invalid as an extraordinary resolution; and it is said that notwithstanding that all the shareholders in the company were present and were dealing with a matter which was intra vires, and notwithstanding that there was no fraud, still the resolution was invalid on that account\u2026 In my opinion the shareholders are entitled to waive the formality of notice. In re Express Engineering Works, [1920] 1 Ch. 466, is an authority in support of the view that the statutory requirements as to notice can be waived.\nGreer J. said at p. 39:\nThe creditors of the company have no voice in the matter, they cannot object to the validity of a resolution to wind up voluntarily by saying that the proper notice to pass that resolution as an extraordinary resolution has not been given, if all the shareholders have agreed to the resolution and waived the want of notice. This view is supported by the decision of the Court of Appeal in In re Express Engineering Works, [1920] 1 Ch. 466.\nThis case, therefore, is authority for the proposition that the unanimous approval of shareholders, validates the transaction. But again there was a meeting, in this case even a meeting of shareholders, and the only defect alleged was lack of proper notice of that meeting.\nIn Parker and Cooper, Limited v. Reading[9], Astbury J, considered the issuance of a debenture for \u00a32,000 by the company in favour of the director. No fraud was involved. As a matter of fact, the director and secretary of the company had been improperly elected due to failures in procedure by those who had sold their interest in the company to the new group, and then the arrangement was carried out at a board meeting where the improperly elected directors alone were present. There never had been any meeting of shareholders authorizing or approving the transaction. The shareholders, however, of whom there were only four, discussed the matter one with the other and all individually assented. Astbury J. held that the company was bound by the transaction and the debenture was valid, citing Lord Davey in Salomon v. Salomon, supra, and In re Express Engineering Works Ltd. At p. 984, he said: All three judges [in the Express Engineering case] no doubt refer to the fact that there had been a meeting. But I cannot think that they came to their decision because the five shareholders happened to meet together in one room or one place, as distinct from agreeing to the transaction inter se in such manner as they thought fit. Warrington L.J. said: \u201cIt was competent to [the shareholders] to waive all formalities as regards notice of meetings, etc., and to resolve themselves into a meeting of shareholders and unanimously pass the resolution in question.\u201d He is there speaking of the actual facts before him.\nNow the view I take of both these decisions is that where the transaction is intra vires and honest, and especially if it is for the benefit of the company, it cannot be upset if the assent of all the corporators is given to it. I do not think it matters in the least whether that assent is given at different times or simultaneously.\nThis action does not seem to have gone farther. It is a valid authority in favour of the approval of all shareholders even if no meeting takes place, and it is exactly applicable to the present situation. It should be noted that the board of directors\u2019 meeting cannot be considered as being the same thing as a shareholders\u2019 meeting as only two of the four shareholders were present and they were not even properly qualified as directors. The only validating thing must have been the informal approval of the individual shareholders.\nIn In re Almur Fur Trading Company, Bank of United States v. Ross[10], the company was incorporated by Dominion letters patent. All the shares were owned beneficially by one Licht of New York. The president was one Smith of Montreal. When Smith was en route to Europe through New York, Licht sent his secretary to see Smith and to present to him for signature five blank promissory note forms. Smith swore that he executed these notes in order to pay for goods which he had already purchased and which would be invoiced to Licht in New York and for further goods which Licht intended to purchase. Licht filled in the name of the payee in the five notes, one as his own company and the others in the name of another company controlled by him. These notes were endorsed to the bank and it was admitted that the bank was the holder in due course. The company\u2019s by-law provided that notes should be signed by such officer or officers and in such manner as may be from time to time determined by the resolution of the board of directors. The resolution of the board of directors was to the effect that such notes should be signed by the president and countersigned by the auditor. The notes in question bore no such counter signature by the auditor. Lamont J, giving judgment for the Supreme Court of Canada, held that the notes were made in general in accordance with the authority of the president under the by-law and that it was not necessary for the bank to inquire into the authority of a president to sign as set out in any resolution; that persons who were dealing with a company were presumed to have notice of what was contained in the Act, and in a case like the present where the Act refers specifically to the by-laws were bound to ascertain from the by-laws but were not obliged to go further and inquire into whether the directors passed the resolution giving the one officer specific authority. At p. 158, Lamont J. said, perhaps obiter:\nEven if Smith had not any authority to sign the notes who, in this case, can question his right to do so? Certainly not the liquidator, for he stands simply in the place of the company. Now the man who had acquired all the shares in the company at the time the notes were made, and who was in fact the company, not only approved of their being made, but it was at his request and under his direction that they were made. Where all the shareholders of the company have ratified or are estopped from objecting to the making of the notes by the president, it is not, in my opinion, open to the liquidator to question his authority.\nThis case is indeed like the present one in that there was only one beneficial shareholder in the company and that one shareholder, as did George Ridout in this case, not only approved the transaction but instigated it throughout.\nRe Allish v. Allied Engineering of B.C. Ltd.[11], B.C. Court of Appeal. In this case, a managing director, upon a new group taking over the company, was discharged and he sued for damages for illegal dismissal. The company counter-claimed for amounts which had been paid to him on account of salary on the ground that such amounts had never been properly authorized. At trial, the action was dismissed and judgment was given upon the counterclaim. The plaintiff appealed. At pp. 693-4, Sheppard J.A. said:\nIt is common ground that there was no formal resolution to fix the plaintiff\u2019s remuneration. However, the payment of those monies to the plaintiff for his services was an internal matter: Houston v. Victoria Machinery Depot Ltd., [1924] 2 D.L.R. 657 at p. 658, et al. There was no suggestion of fraud and the payment was not out of capital and not ultra vires of the company. The payment was an internal matter and was within the powers of the company and although made without the formal resolution required by Arts. 11 and 57, and therefore ultra vires of the directors, nevertheless such payment may be ratified by the majority of the shareholders\u2026, and the plaintiff as shareholder is not debarred from using his voting power to carry such resolution\u2026 Further, such ratification does not require a formal resolution but may be implied from all the circumstances: Parker & Cooper Ltd. v. Reading, supra.\nIn the case at bar the evidence establishes that the shareholders had full knowledge of all the material facts and that the plan of payment was fully understood by them and approved\u2026 The shareholders in taking the benefit of the plaintiff\u2019s services with full knowledge of the facts must be taken to have approved of the crediting of such sums to his account and of the placing of such funds at his disposal.\nAnd at p. 695:\nFurther, as the credits of salary to the plaintiff\u2019s account were made with the consent of all the shareholders and with their full knowledge of the material facts, there is applicable the following statement in A.-G. Can. v. Standard Trust Co. of New York, [1911] A.C. 498, by Viscount Haldane at pp. 504-5\u2026\n(See above.)\nThe learned judge in appeal again distinguished In re George Newman & Co. on the ground that it dealt with an ultra vires transaction. The counterclaim for return of salary was dismissed.\nIt is true that in the Courts in Ontario in two cases, Re Publishers\u2019 Syndicate, Paton\u2019s Case[12], and Re Queen City Plate Glass Co.[13], the Court held to the principles outlined in In re George Newman & Co., supra. Those cases, however, long pre-dated the decision of the English Courts in Re Express Engineering Works Ltd. and Re Oxted Motor Company Ltd. and Parker & Cooper Ltd. v. Reading, as well as the decision of this Court in Re Almur Fur Trading Co. and the Judicial Committee in Attorney-General for Canada v. Standard Trust Co. of New York.\nTherefore, upon a consideration of the above authorities, I have been led to the conclusion that a corporation, when a matter is intra vires of the corporation, cannot be heard to deny a transaction to which all the shareholders have given their assent even when such assent be given in an informal manner or by conduct as distinguished from a formal resolution at a duly convened meeting. Since, of course, George Ridout not only assented to the transaction but instigated it, his assent being, as admitted, that of the sole beneficial shareholder therefore binds the company.\nBefore parting with the matter, I wish to make it clear that I am not deciding that the transaction between Ridout Real Estate Limited, hereafter referred to as \u201cthe Company\u201d, and the respondent bank was one which it was lawful for the company to enter into. It is unnecessary to express an opinion on this question because it was conceded that the transaction was one within the powers of the company and capable of ratification by the shareholders in general meeting. I have already indicated my view that in such circumstances the unanimous consent of all the shareholders given in fact is as effective to validate the transaction as if given in a formal meeting.\nIt was also conceded (i) that George Ridout was the beneficial owner of every issued share of the capital stock of the company, and (ii) that the appellant did not stand in any position different from that of the company in regard to this transaction. I mention this to make it plain that we were not called upon to decide either of these matters.\nThe appeal should be dismissed and the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirmed. The appellant should pay the costs of the respondent Bank of Nova Scotia. The said respondent the Bank of Nova Scotia should pay the costs of the (Third Parties) respondents George H. Ridout and the Canada Trust Company, executors of the estate of Ernest Ridout, deceased. Upon the respondent the Bank of Nova Scotia paying the said costs of the said (Third Parties) respondents, it should recover such costs from the appellant.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Blake, Cassels & Graydon, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Tilley, Carson, Findlay & Wedd, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the third parties, respondents: O\u2019Marra & O\u2019Marra, Port Credit.\n[1] [1964] 1 O.R. 673, 43 D.L.R.

An arrangement made by Y, the president of the company, involved the sale by one L of a total of 54 shares, and the acquisition of a like number by B. The latter, on March 29, 1962, purchased a draft for $13,500 (U.S.) from the defendant bank in Vancouver and turned it over to Y to effect payment to L.\nUnknown to B was the fact that the shares controlled by L in the company were not registered in his own name. The 410 shares of the company controlled by the American group were registered in the name of a holding company, S, incorporated in British Columbia. To avoid a loss on exchange, the procedure which was followed was to have S issue its cheque to L in the amount of $15,000 (U.S.), which L duly cashed. When the S cheque was returned to the bank in Vancouver there was delivered to the bank the bank draft to L, which was applied to cover the payment made by S.\nThe secretary of the company, by May 9, 1962, had in his possession all the documents necessary to register B as the owner of the 54 shares which he was purchasing from L. However, no share certificate was issued to B at that time and it was not until July 30 that his solicitors were advised that B was recorded on the register of transfers and that share certificates were available for delivery. In the meantime B had repudiated the purchase of shares on the ground that the shares had not been delivered. The company went into liquidation in August 1962.\nIn an action for damages for conversion of the draft, the trial judge held that there had been such conversion. The Court of Appeal in dismissing an appeal from the trial judgment took the position that B was not obliged to accept company shares from S because his contract with L was for the purchase of shares owned by L.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nIf a contract specifically stipulated for delivery of a specified article, or in a specified manner, a party to it was entitled to insist upon performance in the agreed manner. Here, however, there was no written contract, and no evidence that, in his negotiations with L, B stipulated for the purchase of shares which must have been registered in L's own name.\nB knew that Y had negotiated the purchase for B and others from the American group of a block of company shares, and that the draft was turned over to Y to pay for those shares which B was to acquire. The draft, while it did not reach L directly, was used to effect that payment. The bank could not be guilty of conversion merely because B was not aware of the actual procedure by means of which the deal was to be finally effected.\nBowes v. Shand (1877), 2 App. Cas 455, distinguished.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, affirming a judgment of Munroe J. in an action for conversion of a negotiable instrument. Appeal allowed.\nF. H. Bonnel, Q.C., and D. A. Freeman, for the defendant, appellant.\nH. E. Hutcheon, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, which affirmed the judgment at trial in an action in which the respondent, Bloomer, was plaintiff and the appellant bank the defendant. Bloomer obtained a judgment for $14,183.44, plus interest and costs, in respect of a claim for conversion by the bank of a bank draft purchased by him from the bank, in the amount of $13,500 U.S. funds, payable to one James C. Lewis and drawn on the United California Bank.\nOn April 17, 1961, Bloomer became an employee of Nutri-Bio of Canada Ltd. (hereinafter called \"the company\"), in Vancouver. The company, which was a private company incorporated under the Canadian Companies Act, and an affiliated company in the United States of America, Nutri-Bio Corporation, were engaged in the distribution and sale of dietary supplements. In February 1962, Bloomer became the vice-president of the company in charge of distributor relations. The president of the company was Charles W. Young, and he and Bloomer had their offices in the premises of the company in Vancouver.\nBloomer and certain other persons connected with the company became interested in the acquisition of shares in the company, which were owned by a group living in the United States, which controlled 410 out of the 1,000 issued common shares of the company. They were interested in acquiring the shares because of the likelihood of the company being converted into a public company and making a public issue of its shares.\nBloomer had had some discussion with James C. Lewis, of Los Angeles, regarding the acquisition of some shares from him, in December of 1961. Early in 1962, Young had discussions with Lewis, in Los Angeles, regarding Bloomer acquiring some of Lewis's shares.\nThe discussions culminated in a meeting held at the offices of the company in March 1962, which is described in the following extract from the evidence of W.R.D. Underhill, the solicitor and secretary of the company:\nSubsequently in 1962 I was advised by Mr. Young in Mr. Bloomer's presence that Mr. Young was engaging in negotiations with certain members of the American group, among them, Lewis, for the sale of shares in Nutri-Bio of Canada Ltd., to a number of Canadian officers of the company, including Bloomer, Strong and Granholme. These negotiations had gone on for some period of time and at the end of March, I was at the office, company offices for business purposes and present at a meeting, at which meeting there was also present Mr. Bloomer, Mr. Young and I believe Mr. Granholme, and I was informed at that meeting that a sale had been negotiated of shares to Bloomer, Strong and Granholme. I was informed of the price and I was informed that Mr. Bloomer's draft in payment for the shares was on Mr. Young's desk. The meeting took place in Young's office. I was asked to attend to the details of effecting the share transfer.\nThe arrangement made by Young involved the sale by Lewis of a total of 54 shares, and the acquisition of a like number by Bloomer. The draft referred to is the one which is in issue, which Bloomer purchased from the bank on March 29, 1962. After purchasing it, Bloomer had handed it to Young's secretary, saying: \"Here is the draft for Mr. Lewis.\"\nAs previously noted, Young was conducting the negotiations for the share purchases, including Bloomer's, and in evidence Bloomer stated that Young negotiated the price of the shares and the actual sale of the shares with Lewis on Bloomer's behalf. He was also asked the following question and gave the following answer:\nQ. Now, would it be correct to say, Mr. Bloomer, that you left the question of the acquisition of these shares and the payment of the money entirely in the hands of Chuck Young and Mr. Underhill?\nA. In as much as the money to be sent to James C. Lewis when I acquired the shares, yes. Unknown to Bloomer, but known to Underhill, as secretary of the company, was the fact that the shares controlled by Lewis in the company were not registered in his own name. The 410 shares of the company controlled by the American group were registered in the name of a holding company, Saturn Enterprises Ltd., incorporated in British Columbia. All of the shares in Saturn were registered in the name of another holding company, Mars Holdings Limited, also incorporated in British Columbia, whose shares were owned by the American group in the same proportions as the respective share holdings they had had in the company prior to their transfer to Saturn. These holding companies had been created at the suggestion of Underhill in order to meet certain tax problems in the United States. In the result, however, each of the shareholders of Mars could exercise control over, and could dispose of those shares in the company, now registered in the name of Saturn, which, previously, he had owned in his own name. The procedure followed by a beneficial owner in effecting a sale of shares held on his behalf in the company was to have Saturn effect the sale to the purchaser, the proceeds then being applied by Saturn in the purchase, from the beneficial owner, of a proportionate number of the shares held by him in Mars.\nThe draft which Bloomer had delivered to Young's secretary to effect payment for the shares to be obtained from Lewis was made payable to Lewis, and not to Saturn, of whose existence Bloomer was not aware. Underhill learned from the bank that if the draft were to be cancelled there would be a loss on exchange. The procedure which was followed was to have Saturn issue its cheque to Lewis in the amount of $15,000 (U.S.), which Lewis duly cashed. When the Saturn cheque was returned to the bank in Vancouver there was delivered to the bank the bank draft to Lewis, which was applied to cover the payment made by Saturn. On April 4 both documents came into the hands of the associate manager of the foreign exchange department of the bank at its main office in Vancouver, and the above procedure was followed. He was not aware that the bank draft had initially been purchased by Bloomer, and assumed that it belonged to Saturn. He marked the draft \"Proceeds refunded to Purchaser\", and Saturn obtained the credit for it. This occurred on April 4, 1962. Prior to that time, Underhill had communicated with Butler, a lawyer in the United States, who acted for Nutri-Bio Corporation (the American company) and who also represented most of the American group who controlled shares in the company, including Lewis, and arranged for the delivery to Butler of Saturn's share certificate for 410 shares in the company, and for payment to those persons who controlled them for those shares which were being sold. The certificate was forwarded to Underhill on April 17, and in the meantime Underhill prepared the directors' resolution approving the transfers from Saturn to the various purchasers. The signed resolution was in Underhill's possession on May 8 or 9. Underhill says he signed this and gave instructions to file it in the minute book and to have the share register noted accordingly.\nNo share certificate was issued to Bloomer at that time, and in the latter part of June Bloomer inquired about it. Underhill told him the certificates were not prepared, but that he would do so as soon as he could, but that he was pressed with other business, particularly company business.\nOn June 29 Bloomer was discharged from the service of the company. A few days later he learned that the proceeds of the draft had been received by Saturn.\nOn July 17 Bloomer wired Lewis to advise that he was repudiating the purchase of shares from him on the ground that the shares had not been delivered and on other grounds, which were not stated. This was confirmed by a letter from Bloomer's solicitors.\nOn July 30 Underhill wrote to Bloomer's solicitors, advising that Bloomer was recorded on the register of transfers and that the share certificates were available for delivery.\nIn August 1962, the company made a proposal under the Bankruptcy Act and then went into liquidation under the Winding Up Act.\nOn January 18, 1963, Bloomer issued a writ against the bank claiming damages for conversion of the bank draft, on the basis that the bank had wrongfully converted the proceeds of his draft.\nThe learned trial judge held that there had been a conversion by the bank of Bloomer's draft. He relied upon the statements of the law made in Paget's Law of Banking, 6th ed., p. 303: A conversion is a wrongful interference with goods, as by taking, using or destroying them, inconsistent with the owner's right of possession. To constitute this injury, there must be some act of the defendant repudiating the owner's right, or some exercise of dominion inconsistent with it.\nIntention is no element in conversion.\n\"Any person who, however innocently, obtains possession of goods the property of another who has been fraudulently deprived of the possession of them, and disposes of them, whether for his own benefit or that of another person, is guilty of a conversion.\"\nHe also cited from Salmond on Torts, 13th ed., p. 262:\nA conversion is an act of wilful interference, without lawful justification, with any chattel in a manner inconsistent with the right of another, whereby that other is deprived of the use and possession of it. Two elements are combined in such interference: (1) a dealing with the chattel in a manner inconsistent with the right of the person entitled to it, and (2) an intention in so doing to deny that person's right or to assert a right which is in fact inconsistent with such right.\nHe rejected the defence that Young and Underhill had authority to deal with the draft in the way they did, and also the defence that the bank's disposition of the draft had not caused damage to Bloomer.\nThe Court of Appeal took the position that Bloomer was not obliged to accept company shares from Saturn because his contract with Lewis was for the purchase of shares owned by Lewis. On this point reference was made to Bowes v. Shand[1] , per Lord Cairns L. C. at p. 463:\nMy Lords, if that is the natural meaning of the words, it does not appear to me to be a question for your Lordships, or for any Court, to consider whether that is a contract which bears upon the face of it some reason, some explanation why it was made in that form, and why the stipulation is made that the shipment should be during these particular months. It is a mercantile contract, and merchants are not in the habit of placing upon their contracts stipulations to which they do not attach some value and importance, and that alone might be a sufficient answer.\n***\nMy Lords, I must submit to your Lordships that if it be admitted, as the Lord Justice is willing to admit, that the literal meaning would imply that the whole quantity must be put on board during a specified time, it is no answer to that literal meaning, it is no observation which can dispose of, or get rid of, or displace, that literal meaning, to say that it puts an additional burden on the seller, without a corresponding benefit to the purchaser; that is a matter of which the seller and the purchaser are the best judges. Nor is it any reason for saying that it would be a means by which purchasers without any real cause would frequently obtain an excuse for rejecting contracts when prices had dropped. The non-fulfilment of any term in any contract is a means by which a purchaser is able to get rid of the contract when prices have dropped; but that is no reason why a term which is found in a contract should not be fulfilled. In the same case Lord Hatherley said at p. 474:\nNow under these circumstances, and with the plain meaning of the contract lying, as it appears to me, on its surface, we are not entitled to speculate on the reasons and motives which have induced those who are engaged in this particular trade, those who have this \"usual run,\" as the witness describes it, of contracts before them from time to time, and who must have pondered upon the matter, to frame their contracts in the manner which pleases them best.\nThere is no doubt that if a contract specifically stipulates for delivery of a specified article, or in a specified manner, a party to it is entitled to insist upon performance in the agreed manner. In the Bowes case there was a written contract for the sale of rice to be shipped in specified months, and the purchaser was held to be entitled to insist upon shipment in that period.\nThere is no written contract here, and no evidence that, in his negotiations with Lewis, Bloomer stipulated for the purchase of shares which must have been registered in Lewis' own name. The negotiations with Lewis were conducted by Young, who was not Lewis' agent. In his own evidence, in chief, Bloomer was asked: \"What were you to get out of the transaction?\" and his reply was: \"I was to get 54 shares of Nutri-Bio of Canada Ltd. from James C. Lewis transferable to my name.\" I am satisfied, on reading all the evidence, that this accurately describes the deal between Bloomer and Lewis. The evidence, previously reviewed, shows that Lewis was personally in control of that number of shares in the company through the two holding companies. I am satisfied that, in so far as Lewis was concerned, the contract between him and Bloomer was performed. The secretary of the company had in his possession, by May 9, all the documents necessary to register Bloomer as the owner of the 54 shares which he was purchasing from Lewis. Any delays thereafter in effecting the registration and issuing a share certificate to Bloomer were the responsiblity of the company secretary, and not of Lewis.\nIn the light of this, I do not see how it can be said that the bank could be made liable for the conversion of Bloomer's draft. That draft was acquired by Bloomer in order to effect payment to Lewis for the shares which Bloomer was purchasing from him. Bloomer, in his evidence, previously cited, said that inasmuch as the money to be sent to Lewis when he acquired the shares was concerned, the payment was left in the hands of Young and Underhill. The draft was used as the means whereby Lewis received payment for those shares. It is true that it did not reach Lewis directly, but it was used by Young and Underhill to effect that payment. Adopting the statement in Paget's Law of Banking, previously cited, I do not see how it can be said that the act of the bank, in crediting it to Saturn's account to cover Saturn's cheque to Lewis, was an act which repudiated Bloomer's right or an exercise of dominion inconsistent with it. The essential facts are that Bloomer knew that Young had negotiated the purchase for Bloomer and others from the American group of a block of company shares, and that the draft was turned over to Young to pay for those shares which Bloomer was to acquire. When the draft was used for that purpose I cannot see how the bank is guilty of conversion merely because Bloomer was not aware of the actual procedure by means of thich the deal was to be finally effected.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be allowed and the respondent's action should be dismissed. The bank is entitled to its costs here and in the Courts below.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Freeman, Freeman, Silvers & Koffman, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: Shakespeare & Hutcheon, Vancouver.\n[1] (1877), 2 App. Cas. 455.\n",

McBeath (Defendants) Respondents.\n1965: May 5, 6, 7; 1965: June 24.\nPresent: Cartwright, Abbott, Judson, Ritchie and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR MANITOBA\nPhysicians and surgeons\u2014Malpractice action\u2014Piece of gauze found in patient's body\u2014Whether left there during operation performed by second defendant in 1959 or during one performed by first defendant in 1944. The plaintiffs, husband and wife, brought an action for malpractice against the defendants, R and McB, both doctors. The judgment of the trial judge dismissing the action was confirmed, by a majority, on appeal to the Court of Appeal. The question for determination was whether McB had left in the female plaintiff's body in an operation on November 19, 1959, gauze which he or others placed there during the operation, or whether such gauze had remained in the plaintiff's body from the time R performed an operation on her in 1944. An action upon the latter operation was statute barred. The plaintiff had a series of other surgical procedures in reference to her kidney area, i.e., an opening of the 1959 operative area on April 5, 1960, and again in November of the same year, but it was agreed that there was no evidence that the gauze could have been left on either of those occasions and in fact both of those surgical procedures were attempts to find the reason for the plaintiff's symptoms which reason was revealed on May 24, 1961, when in the third surgical procedure McB recovered the piece of gauze.\nHELD (Cartwright and Judson JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Abbott, Ritchie and Spence JJ. :The argument that R had excluded the possibility of the piece of gauze having been left at the site of the 1944 operation was not accepted. R had no more exact memory of the operation in 1944 than did McB of that in 1959. Both had to depend on their records and the record of the 1944 operation was very incomplete. Moreover, radi-opaque gauze had not been introduced into Canada in 1944 or for many years thereafter and the gauze found in the plaintiff's body in the operation of 1961 was not radi-opaque.\nAs to the argument that it was highly improbable that the plaintiff could have carried in her body from 1944 to 1959 this piece of gauze and remain symptom free and in good health, it was not plain that the plaintiff had remained absolutely symptom free. There had been expert testimony that a non-metallic foreign body could remain in a human body for such a long period symptom free.\nThe trial judge was ready to accept the evidence of the head nurse upon the all important subject of the type of gauze available in the operating room during the 1959 operation, and the correctness of the count of material available after the operation, and regarded it as part of the \"completely credible evidence\" given to indicate the improbability of the particular kind of gauze found in the plaintiff's body being used in an operation in 1959.\nThe site where the gauze was found was walled off from McB at the time of the 1959 operation by dense tissue through which in 1961 he had to cut in order to discover the gauze. An analysis of X-ray plates taken in 1947 suggested that there was a space-occupying lesion in or close to the exact place where the gauze was found. This lesion could have been the result of surgery, a tumor or foreign material. The operations in 1959 and again in 1961 revealed there was no tumor or abscess.\nThe conclusion reached, therefore, which was the same as that arrived at by the trial judge, was that not only had the plaintiff failed to prove that this gauze was inserted during the 1959 operation and not removed by McB, but considering all the factors the probabilities were that the gauze had been left in the plaintiff's body since the operation of 1944 and had remained dormant until the 1959 disturbance.\nClarke v. Edinburgh & District Tramways Co., [1919] S.C. (H.L.) 35, applied.\nPer Cartwright and Judson JJ., dissenting: The evidence made it clear that after recovering the gauze on May 24, 1961, McB was of the opinion that it had been left in the patient's body at the time of the 1959 operation. The reasonable inference from the whole record in the case was that the theory on which the defence succeeded was first evolved at some time after the examination for discovery. This was a circumstance which supported the view that the probability was that the gauze had been left in the patient's body in 1959 rather than in 1944.\nAs to the nature of the gauze used in the November 1959 operation, the head nurse had testified not from personal recollection but in reliance on her written record and that document did not indicate that only radi-opaque gauze was used. The allegation that only radi-opaque gauze was used in that operation was made by the defendants in the course of the trial and the onus of proving it would lie upon them not merely because they were asserting it but also because the subject-matter of the allegation lay particularly within their knowledge. This onus was not discharged.\nPleet v. Canadian Northern Quebec R.W. Co.

(dissenting):\u2014The nature of the plaintiff's action and the course of the proceedings in the Courts below are set out in the reasons of my brother Spence.\nThe question that we are called upon to decide, while sufficiently difficult of solution to have caused differences of opinion in the Court of Appeal and in this Court, is easy to state. It is whether the piece of gauze which was admittedly left in the body of Mrs. Radclyffe was left there during an operation performed by Dr. Rennie in 1944 or during one performed by Dr. McBeath on November 19,1959. The burden resting on the appellants at the trial was to shew that, on the balance of probabilities, it was on the later date that the mishap occurred.\nOn the hearing of the appeal we had the assistance of full and able arguments in which the evidence and the reasons given in the Courts below were carefully analysed. After deliberating at the conclusion of the argument of counsel for the respondents the Court informed counsel for the appellants that they need not reply on the question of negligence, as we were all of opinion that if it were held that the gauze was left in the patient's body during the operation of November 19, 1959, the appellants were entitled to succeed. Nothing can usefully be added to the reasons of Freedman J.A. on this point.\nAfter an anxious consideration of the record, I find myself in full agreement with the reasons and conclusion of Freedman J.A. who dissented in the Court of Appeal and I wish to make reference to only two matters.\nDr. McBeath is a skilled and experienced surgeon. It was he who performed the operation of November 19, 1959, when the plaintiffs claim that the gauze was left in the patient's body, and the operation of May 24, 1961, when it was removed. He was in a better position than anyone else could be to determine whether or not the mishap had occurred at the November 1959 operation and the evidence makes it clear that after recovering the gauze on May 24, 1961, he was of the opinion that it had been left in at the time of the 1959 operation.\nMr. Radclyffe who was accepted by the learned trial judge as a truthful witness, gave the following answer to a question asking him to tell any conversation he had with Dr. McBeath on May 24,1961, following the recovery of the gauze.\nA. Yes, I had additional conversation with Dr. McBeath at that time and Dr. McBeath said that he had mixed feelings regarding my wife's case. He said he was highly elated for one reason and he was somewhat embarrassed for another reason. He said he was highly elated because he had been able to locate and successfully remove the gauze. He was elated because his diagnosis of the trouble had been correct and that the Mayo Clinic's diagnosis had been wrong but he was embarrassed because the gauze was there in the first place and he said to me \"Ted, I take full responsibility for leaving it there\". There was no direct denial of this statement having been made. There was a suggestion in argument that this conversation might have occurred before the operation of May 24, 1961, but that could scarcely be so as it was the actual recovery of the gauze which, for the first time, demonstrated that Dr. McBeath's diagnosis was right and that made by the Mayo Clinic was mistaken.\nOf course, I do not regard this statement of Dr. McBeath as a binding admission of liability on his part. Its importance is that it shews his opinion following the recovery of the gauze, an opinion which he would seem to have still held at the time when he was examined for discovery on June 5, 1962.\nThe statement of defence was delivered on January 30, 1962. It contains no hint that the gauze which it admits was removed from the patient's body on May 24, 1961, had been there since 1944. One of the purposes of pleadings is to define the issues to be tried. I think the reasonable inference from the whole record in this case is that the theory on which the defence succeeded was first evolved at some time after the examination for discovery. I wish to make it perfectly clear that in saying this I am not imputing any lack of good faith to the defendants or to their advisers but it is a circumstance which appears to me to support the view of Freedman J. A. that the probability is that the gauze was left in the patient's body in 1959 rather than in 1944.\nThe second matter to which I wish to refer is the evidence in regard to the nature of the gauze. The defence was founded to a substantial extent on the supposition that all gauze used in the 1959 operation was radi-opaque, and that no gauze of the kind removed in 1961 was used in the operation of 1959. In regard to this the learned trial judge said:\nDr. McBeath was positive that he had never used the kind of gauze in question in his life.\nWith the greatest respect, I think this statement is in error.\nExhibit 3, at the trial, was the gauze which had been removed from the patient's body in May 1961.\nAt the commencement of the trial counsel for the plaintiffs read some questions and answers from the examination for discovery of the defendants and then called Dr. McBeath for cross-examination pursuant to the provisions of Rules 236 and 237 of the King's Bench Rules.\nIn the course of this cross-examination there are the following questions and answers:\nQ. Did you use gauze like Exhibit 3 in your operation on November 19, 1959?\nA. Gauze like this?\nQ. Yes?\nA. Definitely not.\n* * *\nQ. Now, I would like to ask you what it would be used for. I am talking of Exhibit 3 in this trial. What would it be used for in an operation, a kidney operation?\nA. You don't use stuff like this in kidney operations, sir.\nIt may be observed in passing that the operation in 1944 was also a kidney operation.\nIf the answers quoted above stood alone they might justify the finding that Dr. McBeath \"was positive that he have never used the kind of gauze in question\"; but later in the trial when Dr. McBeath was called by the defence and under direct examination by his own counsel we find the following :\nQ. Now, I show you Exhibit 3. I think you have seen this before?\nA. Yes, sir.\nQ. It is in three pieces now and I think the other day when Mr. McArthur was cross-examining you, or Mr. Scarth, I am not sure which, you said that you had not used gauze like that. I am not attempting to repeat exactly what you said but you hadn't used gauze like that in the operation that you performed in November, 1959?\nA. That is so, sir.\nQ. Why do you say that?\nA. From information obtained within the last few days as to which gauzes I used I don't know of my own memory which gauzes I used, sir, but from information obtained in the last few days about the gauzes I used, this one\u2014\nTHE COURT: This is hearsay, isn't it? This is purely hearsay. Your question I don't think can be allowed.\nMr MOFFAT : If it were information that came out here at the trial, my lord, I would think\u2014that is if there is evidence.\nTHE COURT: What somebody told him either in Court or somewhere else I am quite sure is heresay. That is a ruling that is quite definite. The words I have italicized in this passage indicate that far from being positive as a matter of his own knowledge or recollection Dr. McBeath was relying on information received from others. The only witness who gave evidence of any weight to support the contention that only radi-opaque gauze was used at the operation of November 19, 1959, was the nurse Mrs. Woods. It is common ground that she testified not from personal recollection but in reliance on her written record, ex. 19, and that document does not indicate that only radi-opaque gauze was used. I agree with the comments of Freedman J.A. on this evidence.\nThe allegation that only radi-opaque gauze was used in the operation of November 19, 1959, was made by the defendants in the course of the trial and the onus of proving it would lie upon them not merely because they were asserting it but also because the subject-matter of the allegation lay particularly within their knowledge. In my view this onus was not discharged. On this point it is sufficient to refer to the following passage in the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in Pleet v. Canadian Northern Quebec R.W.Co.[2] :\nNo doubt the general rule is that he who asserts must prove, and that the onus is generally upon the plaintiff, but there are two well-known exceptions:\u2014(1) That where the subject-matter of the allegation lies particularly within the knowledge of one of the parties, that party must prove it, whether it be of an affirmative or negative character:\nI would allow the appeal, set aside the judgments below and direct that judgment be entered against the defendant Dr. McBeath in favour of Mrs. Radclyffe for $15,000 the damages provisionally assessed by the learned trial judge. As the majority of the Court are of opinion that the appeal fails nothing would be gained by determining the amount of damages which should have been awarded to Mr. Radclyffe, to whom leave to appeal was granted at the opening of the argument in this Court. I would have directed that the plaintiffs should recover from Dr. McBeath one set of costs at the trial and in the Court of Appeal and their costs in this Court and that the action against Dr. Rennie should stand dismissed without costs.\nThe judgment of Abbott, Ritchie and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nSPENCE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[3] which confirmed, by a majority (Freedman J.A. dissenting), the judgment of the trial judge, the late Mr. Justice Maybank, dismissing the plaintiffs'action.\nThe action was one for malpractice against the defendants, both doctors. Although there was an appeal from the dismissal of the action against the defendant Dr. James W. Rennie, that dismissal was confirmed in the Court of Appeal, and at the opening of the argument in this Court counsel for the appellant stated that he did not wish to urge that Dr. Rennie be held liable. Schultz J.A. in his reasons for judgment in the Court of Appeal for Manitoba summarized the plaintiffs' grounds for appeal in four numbered paragraphs. For the purposes of these reasons, I need only consider the first, which was:\nThe evidence clearly indicates that the gauze was left by Dr. McBeath in the body of Mrs. Radclyffe on November 19th, 1959.\nDuring the hearing of the appeal in this Court, some argument was directed toward the submission that if the gauze were present in the female plaintiff's body at the time Dr. McBeath operated on November 19, 1959, he should have discovered it and removed it and that his failure to do so would render him liable. Reference was made to paras. 21 to 23 of the statement of claim. It would appear, however, that those paragraphs dealt solely with the allegation that during the operation on November 19, 1959, Dr. McBeath either directly or through the agency of someone for whom he admitted responsibility placed gauze in the plaintiff's body and failed to remove it.\nI am of the opinion, therefore, that the plain question which must be decided upon this appeal is whether Dr. McBeath did so or not. As the evidence turned out, this question is really the determination of which of two alternative events occurred, i.e., did Dr. McBeath leave in the plaintiff's body in the operation of November 19, 1959, gauze which he or others had placed there during the operation, orhad such gauze remained in the plaintiff's body from the time Dr. Rennie had performed the operation on her in the year 1944? The plaintiff had a series of other surgical procedures in reference to her kidney area, i.e., an opening of the 1959 operative area on April 5, 1960, and again in November of the same year, but counsel were all agreed that there was not the slightest evidence that the gauze could have been left on either of the two last-mentioned occasions and in fact both of those surgical procedures were attempts to find the reason for the plaintiff's symptoms which reason was revealed on May 24, 1961, when in the third surgical procedure Dr. McBeath recovered the piece of gauze.\nThe late Mr. Justice Maybank, after a trial which lasted eight days and the transcript of evidence of which occupied 730 pages, gave written reasons for judgment in which he stated that it was not possible for him to give as comprehensive a review of the evidence as was his custom in judgments which he reserved. He did, however, give a judgment of a very considerable extent. The learned trial judge found that the defendants were not liable and in the course of doing so made what was, in my view, a clear finding of fact when he said, in part:\nThis case, like all civil cases, has to be decided on the balance of probabilities. The question here is whether on balance of probabilities the piece of gauze was left in the operating wound made in November 1959, or whether, on the balance of probabilities, that gauze was left there in 1944 and remained dormant all of the time until it was disturbed by the 1959 operation. It is the responsibility of the plaintiffs to convince that the former is the more likely probability. I have come to the conclusion that the plaintiffs have not proven their case. In fact, considering all of the factors, I think the probabilities are that the gauze had been left there those 15 or 16 years ago, and had remained dormant until the 1959 disturbance. Hence judgment must be against the plaintiffs with costs to the defendants.\nThe learned trial judge's judgment was confirmed on appeal in carefully stated reasons given by Schultz and Monnin JJ.A. Freedman J.A. dissented. After quoting the learned trial judge's statement as follows:\n\u2026So far as all parties are concerned I was greatly impressed by the moderation of the litigants. I rate the integrity of them all most highly. Similarly with respect to all witnesses I would say that everyone of them was fair and most careful in presenting what he or she considered to be the truth. It is one of those cases in which the presiding judge has no worry whatever about veracity. True, some witnesses gave evidence that such and such things were facts when he or she had concluded those things to be facts only by reason of what was the prevailing practice with regard to the matter at the time under discussion. However it was made clear in such cases that \"truth\" was so declared because such witnesses were reconstructing a happening by reason of the general practice with reference to same. For instance one nurse gave evidence that certain things were done but promptly admitted that she said so because such things were always done. and coming to the conclusion that like the learned trial judge he would not rely on the admission that Dr. McBeath allegedly made, he continued:\nThis surely is a case for the application of what was so forcibly stressed by the House of Lords in Benmax v. Austin Motor Co. Ltd. [1955] 1 All E.R. 326, namely, the distinction between the perception of facts and the evaluation of facts. A trial judge makes a finding that a specific fact occurred. There is universal reluctance on the part of an appellate court to reject such a finding, particularly where it is founded on credibility. But the evaluation of facts is a different matter entirely. That involves no rejection whatever of the trial judge's finding. Rather his finding becomes the essential starting point from which the appellate court carries on its deliberations. Accepting the trial judge's finding, the appellate court then asks itself: what is the effect of this finding? What probative value does it possess? What inferences should fairly be drawn from it? In answering these questions the appellate court is properly entitled to arrive at its own independent opinion, even if it differs from that of the trial judge.\nWith all respect for the learned justice in appeal, I am of the opinion that this is an over-simplification of the situation. Although the learned trial judge had found in the clearest of terms in favour of the veracity of all witnesses, he was nevertheless required to exercise his critical faculty in weighing not whether they were telling the truth but the many other factors which go to the acceptance of their evidence as proving certain facts. Here I adopt, as did Schultz J.A. in the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, the words of Lord Shaw in Clarke v. Edinburgh & District Tramways Co.[4], at p. 36:\n'When a judge hears and sees witnesses and makes a conclusion or inference with regard to what is the weight on balance of their evidence, that judgment is entitled to great respect, and that quite irrespective of whether the Judge makes any observation with regard to credibility or not'; and further, after commenting on the type of case and the advantage enjoyed by the trial Judge who hears the witnesses, he adds: 'In my opinion, the duty of an appellate court in those circumstances is for each Judge of it to put to himself \u2026 the question Am I\u2014who sit here without those advantages, sometimes broad and sometimes subtle, which are the privilege of the Judge who heard and tried the case\u2014in a position, not having those privileges, to come to a clear conclusion that the Judge who had them was plainly wrong? If I cannot be satisfied in my own mind that the Judge with those privileges was plainly wrong, then it appears to me to be my duty to defer to his judgment.'\nIn the particular instance, I think I might well go farther. The allegation made by the defendant McBeath at trial that the gauze was left in the plaintiff's body not during his operation of November 1959 but during Dr. Rennie's operation of 1944 (an action upon the latter is statute barred) is answered by many arguments. Firstly, Dr. Rennie, in the words used in the appellants' factum in this Court \"has excluded the possibility of the piece of gauze having been left at the site of the operation of November 1960, and has to all intents and purposes excluded the possibility of the piece of gauze having been left there in the 1944-45 operation\". I am of the opinion that it cannot be said that Dr. Rennie was so successful as to the 1944 operation.\nDr. Rennie's cross-examination as to the latter was, in part, as follows:\nQ. I take it at the time that you performed that operation that you took all of the ordinary precautions, you and Dr. Mackie, the surgeons would in the ordinary way to prevent any error on your part?\nA. I am sure I would have taken all the ordinary precautions that were in operation at that time.\nQ. And I suggest to you that when you sewed up the wound and the operation was complete that you were certain that there was no foreign material, gauze, in the wound at that time? \u2026\nA. I was as certain as one could be at that time.\nSince Dr. Rennie has no more exact memory of the operation in 1944 than did Dr. McBeath of that in 1959, both had to depend upon their records. The record retained and produced as to the 1944 operation was very incomplete since in the microfilming process only the front page had been copied and not all of the details.\nIt is moreover quite plain that radi-opaque gauze had not been introduced into Canada in 1944 or for many years thereafter and the piece of gauze found in the plaintiff's body in the operation of May 1961 was not radi-opaque. The second answer is that it was highly improbable that the plaintiff could have carried in her body from 1944 to 1959 a piece of gauze, the size of which was not accurately determined but which would certainly seem to be at least 2\" by 3\", and remain symptom free and in good health throughout.\nFirstly, it is not plain that the plaintiff was absolutely symptom free. During the 15-year interval she did see a doctor on many occasions, had some surgical procedures performed which were not in the area in which the gauze was found, but she also did complain on occasion of low-back pain. Much more important, both the defendant Dr. McBeath and the five expert witnesses, David Swartz, Albert C. Abbott, Charles B. Stewart, Dr. C. W. Clark, and Dr. C. E. Corrigan, testified that a non-metallic foreign body could remain in a human body for such a long period symptom free and some of these experts gave, from either their personal knowledge or medical reading, graphic examples. It was argued strenuously in this Court that such evidence was largely hearsay. Perhaps some of it was but not all of it, and moreover, as Schultz J.A. pointed out in his reasons in the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, it is in accordance with medical writing, and an instance of it did occur in Mondot v. Vallejo General Hospital[5]. Freedman J.A. in his reasons, after referring to this evidence, continued:\nWhat should a civil court, deciding issues on the balance of probabilities, do in face of this testimony? Shall it conclude that Mrs. Radclyffe's case, characteristic though it is of the pattern, type, and consequences that normally follow the introduction of a foreign body, but yet fail because in the behaviour of foreign bodies there are rare exceptions and hers might be one of them? I say most emphatically that to judge her case in that way would be to require her to satisfy an inordinately high, indeed almost an impossible, standard of proof. Applying the accepted standard of the balance of probabilities, I would hold that what occurred in Mrs. Radclyffe's case was the normal, the usual, the expected consequence of the introduction of a foreign body, rather than something exceptional, bizarre, or freakish. In short, I would find that the gauze in question was introduced during the operation of November, 1959, rather than in that performed 15 years earlier.\nHowever, even granting that the weight of the expert testimony on this subject only reduced the situation from an impossibility, or at any rate a great improbability, to a possibility and certainly not a probability, as Freedman J.A. indicated, there was other evidence which the learned trial judge had to weigh in order to come to his conclusion. Most important upon that issue and, in my view, absolutely decisive is the type of gauze which Dr. McBeath found in the female plaintiff's body in the operation performed in May of 1961. It is admitted by all that that gauze was not radi-opaque and it was admitted by all that no radi-opaque gauze was available in Canada in 1944. What is asserted by the defendants is that only radi-opaque gauze was used in the operating room available for urological surgery in the Misericordia Hospital in November 1959. Freedman J.A.'s statement on this subject is as follows: Here certainly is a cogent submission, if it can be proved. Evaluating the evidence as fairly as I can, I am bound to say that it has not been proved. Indeed the evidence on this point is more remarkable for what it does not say than for what it does say. If it were really the case that in 1959, in operations performed at the Misericordia Hospital, nothing but radio opaque gauze was used, it would have been a matter of the utmost simplicity to establish the point. A qualified senior official of the hospital, with knowledge of the facts, could have been brought to the stand to so testify. But no such person was brought. Instead the defendants ask us to conclude from the testimony of other witnesses that only radio opaque gauze was available. \u2026\nThe learned justice in appeal discusses the evidence of those other witnesses. The first one was the officer of the surgical supply firm of Johnson & Johnson who could only testify that in the year 1959 his company sold 35 cases of Raytex (radi-opaque) sponges to this hospital. I am in agreement with Freedman J.A. that such evidence is of negligible value. The second witness, however, Mrs. Christine I. Woods, is in a different category. She was the head nurse in charge of the operating room at the time the operation was performed in November 1959, and she had been such for 18 months prior thereto although not the supervisor of the operating room. She gave evidence from her knowledge of the procedures and techniques in the operating room that during the whole of the period she was in that operating room nothing but radi-opaque gauze was available therein. She further gave exact evidence that as was her duty she had before the operation commenced carefully counted all the \"material\", i.e., gauze and cotton sponges which were made available for the use of the surgeon, Dr. McBeath, in this operation and she had noted the count thereof in writing at that time on the operating room nurse's record produced at the trial as ex. 19, and then at the end of the operation she had counted the \"material\" there remaining in the operating room and while counting it had ticked off the entry she had previously made and reported her count to the surgeon as being correct, and then recounted it and then again reported it and finally circled the word \"correct\" on the said form. She swore that the material on that operating nurse's record was radi-opaque and she described in detail the radi-opaque feature of each type of it.\nNow it is true that this evidence was given not as a first-hand memory of what had occurred because, of course, that head nurse like all the surgeons, had appeared in and taken part in very many operations between November 1959 and the date of the trial but she had available to her her own written record she could read and interpret and she knew the exact practice in the operating room. It is also true that the same written record, ex. 19, shows opposite the typed words \"First Assistant\" her hand-writing of the words \"Dr. Rennie\" and that she swore that she would not have written those words in the report unless Dr. Rennie had been the assistant. The witness even went further and swore that she had seen Dr. Rennie insert sponges in the plaintiff's body, yet it was proved adequately and accepted by the learned trial judge that in fact Dr. Rennie was not even scrubbed for this operation and that all he did was to enter the room when the operation was well-nigh complete, inquire as to progress, and then retire so that he could report to the male plaintiff. That obvious error undoubtedly shook the learned trial judge's reliance on Mrs. Woods' testimony and resulted in Freedman J.A. remarking \"clearly she lacked the necessary qualifications to establish what was the precise policy of the hospital on the matter in question\". The precise policy of the hospital was a relevant consideration but not the one of first importance. What was the one of first importance was what gauze was used in this operation. Here, Mrs. Woods had available her knowledge of general practice and her own written record checked at the time the operation ended and signed by her.\nAlthough the learned trial judge had remarked during the course of the trial, \"I would not pay too much attention to the nurse because she said, 'I am reconstructing' \", he also did say, \"Credible evidence, completely credible evidence, was given to indicate the improbability of this particular kind of gauze being used in an operation in 1959 \u2026\"\nAs did Schultz J. A. in the Court of Appeal, I have come to the conclusion that the late Mr. Justice Maybank was ready to accept the evidence of the nurse Mrs. Woods upon the all important subject of gauze available in the operating room during the November 1959 operation, and the correctness of the count of material available after the operation, and regarded it as part of the \"completely credible evidence\".\nAnother important consideration in the determination of whether the gauze could have been left in the female plaintiff's body in 1959 is its position when it was recovered in the operation of May 1961, some 19 months later. Dr. McBeath swore that although the incision made in 1959 was close to the incision made in 1944 on the surface of the female plaintiff's body, the course of his approach to the definitive operative site thereafter differed from the course of the approach to the definitive operative site of the 1944 operation and that the former could be described as \"down and away from the site where the gauze was found in 1961\". The surgeon's operative record was produced at trial and marked as ex. 18. Dr. McBeath read and interpreted that report and pointed out that he had noted that there was a sufficient degree of fixity of the posterior aspect of the kidney to prevent fully exposing the renal pelvis but that he had been able to expose sufficient of the renal pelvis to permit him to perform the \"Y-V\" Foley reconstructive pyeloplasty which was in essence an enlarging of the junction between the renal pelvis and the ureter. Dr. McBeath testified, and the many expert surgeons who were called as defence witnesses agreed, that if the capsule of the kidney had been incised in the 1944 operation for the removal of the kidney stone the fatty liquid inside the capsule and surrounding the kidney proper would be drained away so that the capsule would fasten itself to the posterior tissues. The process was even described as \"cementing\" itself. It was this fixity of the capsule to the posterior tissues which Dr. McBeath encountered and through which he incised only sufficiently to get to the junction of the pelvis and ureter. Dr. McBeath, therefore, swore that he never was at the exact site where the gauze was found in 1961, during the 1959 operation, and that in fact before he found it in the 1961 operation, he had to further incise through hard tissue in order to expose the gauze cemented between the capsule of the kidney and the posterior tissue. Schultz J. A., in the Court of Appeal, cites this evidence as supporting Dr. McBeath's position that he could not have left the gauze in the female plaintiff's body in the 1959 operation. I agree, as it would appear from this evidence, which is uncontradicted, that the site where the gauze was found 19 months later was walled off from Dr. McBeath by dense tissue through which in 1961 he had to cut in order to discover the gauze. It was emphasized by counsel for the appellant in argument made in this Court that this position taken by Dr. McBeath would seem to be a last minute revision of his evidence, as in examination for discovery he never outlined this defence. That might be true, but finding as the trial judge did, that there was complete veracity in all the testimony, the allegation can go no further than that Dr. McBeath only later realized the effect of the dense tissue affixation of the capsule to the posterior wall. There is no doubt that in his report made contemporaneously with the November 1959 operation he had noted that fixity. There was a good deal of other evidence which I need not detail but which certainly should have been considered, and I have no doubt was considered, by the learned trial judge in coming to his conclusion that the plaintiffs had not proved that the gauze was left in the body of the female plaintiff in the November 1959 operation. Much of that evidence consisted of the production and analysis of x-ray films. The position taken by counsel for the plaintiffs during evidence was that no x-ray film had revealed the possibility that a foreign body might be present in the plaintiff's kidney region prior to that of March 29, 1960, and that such x-ray only revealed an unfilled space. In the subsequent x-ray tests done by injection of fluid into the sinus in April 1961, a cloudy appearance on the film of that unfilled space prompted the radiologist to speculate that there might have been a gauze left in that area.\nSince the failure of all x-ray films prior to 1959 to reveal any sign of this foreign body was emphasized, Dr. McBeath was moved to reconsider all the data including x-ray films which was available to him prior to the November 1959 operation. Amongst those he found one series consisting of four plates taken in 1947 and which had been analyzed by a Dr. McPherson. Dr. McBeath did this during the course of the trial. Dr. McPherson was absent in the Near East and an associate of his, Dr. Arthur Childe, was called to analyze the plates. He swore that these plates taken only three years after the 1944 operation and 12 years before the 1959 operation exhibited that the upper calyces on the right side of the kidney were displaced, the organ being slightly distorted, and that there was some tissue displacement of some of the pelvis of the right kidney and he further gave as his opinion that there was a space-occupying lesion in or close to the upper pole of the right kidney, i.e., the exact place where the gauze was found in 1961. He said that the space-occupying lesion might have been distortion as a result of surgery or a tumor or foreign material adjacent to the upper pole of the right kidney. When confronted with Dr. McPherson's report and when it was pointed out to him that that report mentioned the possibility only of previous surgery or a tumor he observed that that difference was a matter of semantics as the space-occupying lesion could be a tumor or could be a foreign body.\nIt would appear that this evidence is most persuasive and is a very convincing answer to the argument of the appellant that no x-ray prior to 1959 ever gave any ground for ever suspecting the presence of foreign material. In argument in this Court, it was attacked as being altogether inadmissible. I do not think the evidence was inadmissible. The real evidence was there and unquestioned, i.e., the four pieces of x-ray film. The qualification of the radiologist who examined them whether he had seen them only a few minutes before or years before was undoubted and was in fact admitted by counsel for the plaintiff. His report was, as he pointed out, essentially the same as that made by the original radiological examination by Dr. McPherson in 1947. The operations in 1959 and again in 1961 revealed there was no tumor and no abscess, so certainly the existence of a space-occupying lesion of some kind in 1947 is of the greatest significance.\nFor these reasons, I am of the opinion that I am able to conclude, as did the learned trial judge, that not only has the plaintiff failed to prove that this gauze was inserted during the 1959 operation and not removed by the defendant Dr. McBeath but \"considering all the factors I think the probabilities are that the gauze had been left there those 15 or 16 years and had remained dormant until the 1959 disturbance\". I have used the learned trial judge's exact words. I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, Cartwright and Judson JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, appellants: McArthur, McArthur & Gillies, Winnipeg.\nSolicitors for the defendants, respondents: Aikens, MacAulay and Co., Winnipeg.\n[1] (1964), 43 D.L.R.

J. and Fauteux, Abbott, Ritchie and Hall JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nMunicipal corporations\u2014Bakery having place of business outside city limits\u2014Products sold at wholesale to merchants and distributed by trucks inside city limits\u2014Whether exemption from having to pay for permits and licences\u2014Action to recover moneys so paid\u2014Municipal Tax Exemption Act, R.S.Q. 1941, c. 221, s. 6.\nThe plaintiff carried on a bakery business in the town of Jacques-Cartier. It had no property or place of business in the city of Montreal. Its products were sold and distributed exclusively to merchants in the ordinary course of their business, and were sold at wholesale only. During the years 1949, 1950 and 1951, the plaintiff paid over $900 to obtain licences and permits for the purpose of distributing its products in the city of Montreal. This action, which was dismissed by the trial judge, was brought by the plaintiff to recover this money. The Court of Appeal reversed the judgment at trial and maintained the action. The defendant municipality was granted leave to appeal to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nSection 6 of the Municipal Tax Exemption Act, R.S.Q. 1941, c. 221, provides that no municipality shall oblige a person not having a place of business in the municipality to procure a licence in order to take orders for, and to sell and deliver merchandise, if these operations are only carried on with merchants in the ordinary course of their business. The plaintiff clearly came within the provisions of that section and was entitled to the protection which it afforded.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec[1], reversing a judgment of Ralston J. Appeal dismissed. Jean Mercier, Q.C., for the defendant, appellant.\nP. E. Kierans, Q.C., for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nABBOTT J.:\u2014This is an appeal by leave, from a majority judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench[2], rendered October 2, 1961, which reversed a judgment of the Superior Court dated May 2, 1955 and maintained respondent's action in the sum of $926.10 with interest from December 4, 1951, and costs.\nRespondent is a corporation carrying on the bakery business in the Town of Jacques Cartier in the Province of Quebec.\nOn November 12, 1951, respondent took action against the appellant to recover $926.10 paid by respondent to appellant during the years 1949, 1950 and 1951 for permits and licenses in accordance with certain by-laws of appellant, as having been paid in error.\nRespondent has no property or place of business in the City of Montreal. Its products are sold and distributed exclusively to merchants, traders or manufacturers in the ordinary course of their business, and are sold at wholesale only. Respondent's products are not sold directly to consumers, but are distributed in the City of Montreal by its driver-salesmen who load their vehicles at respondent's place of business in the Town of Jacques Cartier. The driver-salesmen maintain a record of the inventory of each of their customers and order their requirements from respondent two days in advance on the basis of the customers' previous sales record for each particular week-day.\nAll vehicles used by respondent in the distribution of its products are registered in respondent's name at its place of business in the Town of Jacques Cartier.\nAppellant sought to oblige respondent to obtain licenses and permits for the purpose of distributing its products in the City of Montreal and to pay the fees imposed therefor under ss. 3 and 5 of appellant's by-law No. 1862. Subsidiarily, appellant has also invoked its by-laws No. 926 and No. 283.\nThe principal point in issue in the present appeal relates to the application of s. 6 of the Municipal Tax Exemption Act, R.S.Q. 1941, c. 221, as amended, which reads: 6. Notwithstanding any other general law or special act, no municipal corporation shall oblige a person not having a place of business in the municipality to pay or to procure a license in order to take orders for, and to sell and deliver mechandise, if these operations are only carried on with merchants, traders or manufacturers in the ordinary course of their business.\nThis section, which had its origin in the statute 50 Vict., c. 15, has undergone a series of amendments over the years, by which the exemption provided for has been extended. The most recent amendment prior to these proceedings was made by the statute 4 Geo. VI, c. 48, s. 1.\nIn my opinion the respondent clearly comes within the provisions of the said s. 6 of the Municipal Tax Exemption Act as amended, and is entitled to the protection which it affords.\nI adopt as my own the following statement of Bissonnette J. in the Court below:\nSi l'on faisait la gen\u00e8se de cette loi qui remonte \u00e0 50 Vict. chap. 15, on y rel\u00e8verait plusieurs temp\u00e9raments que le l\u00e9gislateur y a apport\u00e9s. D'une loi qui sur les refontes de 1888, 1909 et 1925 ne se rapportait qu'\u00e0 l'exemption des commis voyageurs de certaines taxes, on en \u00e9tendit les cadres de fa\u00e7on quasi-illimit\u00e9e pour les non-r\u00e9sidents d'une corporation municipale. En effet, la loi 4, Geo. VI, chap. 48, art. l, a substitu\u00e9 le mot 'personne' \u00e0 la locution 'commis voyageurs', de sorte que, selon le texte de l'art. actuel ci-haut reproduit, une corporation municipale, en d\u00e9pit de sa charte, ne peut obliger une personne (ceci comprend une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ou une compagnie) 'n'ayant pas de place d'affaires \u00e0. payer des taxes ou \u00e0 se munir d'un permis' quand elle ne fait que le commerce de gros. Or, tel est l\u00e0 le genre d'affaires exerc\u00e9es par l'appelante. D'o\u00f9 il faut conclure que celle-ci a \u00e9t\u00e9 ill\u00e9galement tax\u00e9e.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nAttorneys for the defendant, appellant: Parent, McDonald and Mercier, Montreal.\nAttorneys for the plaintiff, respondent: Senecal, Turnbull, Mitchell, Stairs, Kierans, and Claxton, Montreal.\n[1] [1962] Que.

In 1958, his executor received the sum of $13,844.20, being a refund of contributions made by the deceased and his employer to an employees pension fund, and interest earnings. It was admitted that this sum was received during the 1959 taxation year and was taxable. The Minister added this amount to the income of the estate. The executor contended that it was income of the deceased as the value of \"rights or things\" under s. 64(2) of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148. The executor also contended before this Court that if the amount was income of the estate it was deductable under s. 63(4) of the Act as payable to a usufructuary. A further contention was that credit had not been given to the executor for an amount of $2,728.59 paid in respect of taxes owed by the deceased. The Exchequer Court set aside the decision of the Income Tax Appeal Board and upheld the Minister's contentions. The executor appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe amount received from the pension fund could never have become payable in the lifetime of the deceased, and it was clearly a death benefit under the articles of the pension plan. There was no difference in principle between this payment and any other pension benefit payable after death from a pension fund or plan to which a deceased person had contributed. Consequently, the right to such payment was not a right or thing \"the amount whereof when realized or disposed of would have been included in the deceased's income\", had he lived, within the meaning of s. 64(2) of the Act.\nAs to the other two contentions raised by the executor, the assessment should be referred back to the Minister in order that consideration be given to the possible application of s. 63(4) of the Act and to the payment of $2,728.59 said to have been made by the executor.\nRevenu\u2014Imp\u00f4t sur le revenu\u2014Remboursement de contributions faites \u00e0 un fonds de retraite lors de la mort d'un employ\u00e9\u2014Ce montant est-il taxable comme imp\u00f4t de la succession ou comme imp\u00f4t du d\u00e9funt\u2014Loi de l'Imp\u00f4t sur le Revenu, S.R.C. 1952, c. 148, arts. 6(1), (a)(iv), 63(1), (4), 64(2), 139(1)(ar). Le d\u00e9funt est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 en 1957 et par son testament a l\u00e9gu\u00e9 l'usufruit de sa succession \u00e0 son \u00e9pouse. En 1958, son ex\u00e9cuteur a re\u00e7u la somme de $13,844.20, comme \u00e9tant un remboursement de contributions faites \u00e0 un fonds de pension par le d\u00e9funt et par son employeur, ainsi que les int\u00e9r\u00eats. Il est admis que cette somme a \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7ue durant l'ann\u00e9e d'imposition 1959 et \u00e9tait imposable. Le Ministre a ajout\u00e9 ce montant au revenu de la succession. L'ex\u00e9cuteur a pr\u00e9tendu que c'\u00e9tait un revenu du d\u00e9funt comme \u00e9tant la valeur \u00ab de droits ou de choses \u00bb sous le r\u00e9gime de l'art. 62(2) de la Loi de l'Imp\u00f4t sur le Revenu, S.R.C. 1952, c. 148. L'ex\u00e9cuteur a aussi soutenu devant cette Cour que si le montant \u00e9tait un revenu de la succession, il \u00e9tait d\u00e9ductible en vertu de l'art. 63(4) de la loi comme payable \u00e0 un usufruitier. Une autre pr\u00e9tention de l'ex\u00e9cuteur \u00e9tait \u00e0 l'effet qu'un paiement de $2,728.59 qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 en rapport avec les taxes dues par le d\u00e9funt n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9dit\u00e9. La Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier a mis de c\u00f4t\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision de la Commission d'Appel de l'Imp\u00f4t et a maintenu les pr\u00e9tentions du Ministre. L'ex\u00e9cuteur en appela devant cette Cour.\nArr\u00eat: L'appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9.\nLe montant re\u00e7u du fonds de pension n'aurait jamais pu devenir payable durant la vie du d\u00e9funt, et il \u00e9tait clairement un b\u00e9n\u00e9fice r\u00e9sultant de la mort en vertu des articles du plan de pension. En principe il n'y avait aucune diff\u00e9rence entre ce paiement et tout autre b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de pension payable apr\u00e8s d\u00e9c\u00e8s venant d'un fonds ou plan de pension auquel un d\u00e9funt avait contribu\u00e9. En cons\u00e9quence, le droit \u00e0 un tel paiement n'\u00e9tait pas un droit ou chose \u00ab dont le montant obtenu lors de la r\u00e9alisation ou disposition eut \u00e9t\u00e9 inclus dans le calcul du revenu du d\u00e9funt \u00bb, s'il avait v\u00e9cu, dans le sens de l'art. 64(2) de la loi.\nQuant aux deux autres points soulev\u00e9s par l'ex\u00e9cuteur, la cotisation devait \u00eatre retourn\u00e9e au Ministre pour que consid\u00e9ration soit donn\u00e9e \u00e0 l'application possible de l'art. 63(4) de la loi et au paiement de $2,728.59 qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait par l'ex\u00e9cuteur.\nAPPEL d'un jugement du Juge Dumoulin de la Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier du Canada[1], renversant une d\u00e9cision de la Commission d'Appel de l'Imp\u00f4t. Appel rejet\u00e9.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Dumoulin J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada[2], reversing a decision of the Income Tax Appeal Board. Appeal dismissed.\nRobert H. E. Walker, Q.C., for the appellant.\nPaul Ollivier, QC., and Paul Boivin, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nABBOTT J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[3], setting aside a decision of the Income Tax Appeal Board and confirming an assessment of the Minister whereby a pension benefit in the sum of $13,844.20 was added to the income of the estate of the late Kenneth J. McArdle for the taxation year 1959.\nThe facts are not in dispute. The late Mr. McArdle died on February 7, 1957, leaving a will in which he bequeathed the usufruct of his estate to his wife, during her lifetime, and the capital to his three children. His solicitor and the Crown Trust Company were appointed executors.\nAt the time of his death, McArdle was an officer of Public and Industrial Relations Limited and, as such, was a participant in a pension plan set up in 1946 under an Agreement between (1) Vickers & Benson Limited and its subsidiary Public and Industrial Relations Limited, (2) the employees of these two companies, and (3) R. H. Vickers and others as Trustees, which is hereinafter referred to as \"the Agreement\". The Agreement related to both insurance and pension benefits but we are here concerned with the pension benefits alone.\nUpon McArdle's death, his executors became entitled to receive, and did receive on April 9, 1958, under the terms of the Agreement, the said sum of $13,844.20.\nFor the purposes of this appeal it is admitted that this sum was received during the 1959 taxation year and that it is taxable. The question at issue is whether the amount is taxable as income of the estate or as income of the deceased.\nBy Notice of Re-Assessment dated January 31, 1961, the Minister added the amount in question to the income of the estate. The appellant filed a Notice of Objection on the ground that the money received was income of the deceased by virtue of subs. 2 of s. 64 of the Income Tax Act. That was the sole point in issue before the Income Tax Appeal Board and the Exchequer Court.\nUnder the terms of the Agreement, the deceased, during his lifetime, had two principal rights namely (1) to receive a pension if he continued in the employ of the company and reached the stipulated retirement age and (2) to elect, if he left the employ of the company prior to reaching retirement age, to receive a lump sum payment \"equal to the aggregate of all his contributions or to the cash surrender value at the date of termination of employment of that portion of the contract or contracts paid for by his contributions\". Employer and employee contributed equally to the premiums required under the Agreement. The pension benefit, which is in issue here, was bound to be greater than the lump sum payable on leaving the employ of the company, since under the Agreement such pension benefit was equivalent to the \"aggregate of premiums paid prior to death\" which would include the contributions made by both employer and employee.\nThe $13,844.20 received by appellant was clearly an amount \"received out of or under a superannuation or pension fund or plan\" and as such was income by definition, under the provisions of ss. 6(1)(a)(iv) and 139 (1)(ar) of the Act. Indeed this is conceded by appellant.\nAppellant's submission however, both here and below, has been that the amount should have been taxed as income of the late Kenneth J. McArdle under the provisions of subs. 2 of s. 64 of the Act, and not as income of his legal representatives.\nThe general rule under the Income Tax Act is that tax is payable on income actually received by the taxpayer during a taxation period. There are exceptions to this general rule and one of them is to be found in s. 64(2) which reads:\nWhere a taxpayer who has died had at the time of his death rights or things (other than an amount included in computing his income by virtue of subsection (1)), the amount whereof when realized or disposed of would have been included in computing his income, the value thereof at the time of death shall be included in computing the taxpayer's income for the taxation year in which he died, unless his legal representative has, before the tax for the year of death has been assessed, elected that one of the following rules be applicable thereto:\n(a) one-fifth of the value shall be included in computing the taxpayer's income for each of his last 5 taxation years including the year of death but the resulting addition in the amount of tax payable for any year other than the year in which he died is payable 30 days from the day of mailing of the notice of assessment for the year in which he died; or\n(b) a separate return of the value shall be filed and tax thereon shall be paid under this Part for the taxation year in which the taxpayer died as if he had been another person entitled to the deductions to which he was entitled under section 26 for that year,\nin which event, the rule so elected is applicable.\nThe said $13,844.20 unquestionably became payable by reason of covenants contained in the pension plan Agreement but it was not received nor was it receivable prior to McArdle's death and indeed the amount could be definitely ascertained only upon the happening of that contingency. In fact, the amount was not paid to the appellant until April 9, 1958. The sum involved was derived from three sources namely, payments made to the trustees by (1) the deceased (2) his employer and (3) interest earnings. It could never have become payable in the lifetime of the deceased and in my view it was clearly a death benefit under article XI of the Agreement. I can see no difference in principle between such payment and any other pension benefit payable after death from a pension fund or plan to which a deceased person has contributed.\nIt follows that in my opinion the right to such payment was not a right or thing \"the amount whereof when realized or disposed of would have been included in his (McArdle's) income\", had he lived, within the meaning of s. 64 (2).\nCounsel for appellant made another submission before this Court, which he stated had not been raised before the Income Tax Appeal Board or the Exchequer Court, and which is not referred to in his factum. It was based upon s. 63 (4) of the Income Tax Act which reads:\nFor the purposes of this Part, there may be deducted in computing the income of a trust or estate for a taxation year such part of the amount that would otherwise be its income for the year as was payable in the year to a beneficiary or other person beneficially interested therein or was included in the income of a beneficiary for the year by virtue of subsection (2) of section 65.\nI find it difficult to understand this submission. The T-3 Income Tax Return filed by appellant as executor, for the taxation year February 8, 1958, to February 7, 1959, reported all the net income of the estate as having been allocated to the widow. This return, of course, did not report the sum of $13,844.20 as income. That amount was added by the assessment of January 31, 1961, which is in issue on this appeal.\nIn paragraph 10 of its Reply to the Notice of Appeal to the Exchequer Court, when dealing with the said assessment, appellant stated:\n10. Later, the appellant (the Minister) issued an assessment in respect of the taxation year 1958 claiming tax on the said refund as pertaining to the income of Mary I. McArdle, widow of the deceased and income beneficiary under his Will. On Notice of Objection, the Appellant decided, amongst other things, that said refund, as income of the said Mary I. McArdle, appertained to her income for the 1959 taxation year instead of 1958. A new, similar assessment was then issued in respect. of the year 1959. Notice of Objection was rejected, but was maintained by a judgment of the Tax Appeal Board, which judgment is the subject of the present appeal to this honourable Court.\nIt would seem therefore that the provisions of s. 63 (4) were recognized. Under the terms of that section, income payable in a given year by the executor to a beneficiary is not of course taxable in the hands of the executor.\nAppellant also stated that credit had not been given to the executor for a payment of $2,728.59 made in August 1957 with a return of income of the late Kenneth J. McArdle for the period from January 1, 1957, to February 7, 1957, the date of his death. This return was not produced. The payment is not dealt with in the judgment below and is not referred to in the assessment of January 31, 1961, in issue on this appeal. The record does not contain tax returns made by the executor on behalf of the estate for the years 1957 or 1958 or any of the personal returns of the income beneficiary. It does indicate that another appeal with respect to 1958 income is pending before the Income Tax Appeal Board.\nIt is impossible to say on this record what person, if any, is entitled to a tax credit or refund. The payment should, of course, be taken into account in assessing interest or penalties and I have no doubt the Minister will do so. In my view however, it has no bearing on the issue to be determined in this appeal.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs and confirm the assessment of the sum of $13,844.20 as being income of the estate and not income of the late Kenneth J. McArdle. In the circumstances however, and particularly with respect to the possible application of s. 63(4) of the Income Tax Act, I would refer the assessment of January 31, 1961, back to the Minister in order that consideration may be given to the effect of the present judgment and the payment of $2,728.59 said to have been made by appellant in August 1957.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Martineau, Walker, Allison, Beaulieu, Tetley & Phelan, Montreal.\nSolicitor for the respondent: E.

The railway company submitted that the subway should be closed and the highway diverted to pass under a nearby existing railway bridge. The Province, having taken over the responsibility for the highway, agreed to this. The Board authorized the diversion of the highway and held that it had no jurisdiction to authorize a contribution to the project from the Railway Grade Crossing Fund. The Province was assessed the full cost with the exception of $5,000 offered by the railway company. The Province was granted leave to appeal to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nThe existing subway facilities had become inadequate. The proposed diversion was more efficient and less costly than it would have been to enlarge the existing subway. This diversion was an improvement of an existing grade separation within the meaning of s. 265(1) (b) of the Railway Act, and consequently, the Board was empowered to authorize a grant from the railway Grade Crossing Fund towards the cost of the work.\nChemins de fer\u2014Viaduc insuffisant\u2014Requ\u00eate par la municipalit\u00e9 pour \u00e9largir\u2014Contre-proposition par la compagnie que la voie routi\u00e8re soit d\u00e9tourn\u00e9e pour passer sous un pont existant\u2014La Commission des Transports du Canada a-t-elle le pouvoir d'autoriser un octroi de la Caisse des passages \u00e0 niveau de chemins de fer\u2014Loi sur les chemins de fer, S.R.C. 1952, c 234, art. 265(1)(b).\nLe comt\u00e9 de P fit une requ\u00eate aupr\u00e8s de la Commission des Transports du Canada pour obtenir l'autorisation d'\u00e9largir un viaduc pour la raison qu'il ne r\u00e9pondait plus aux besoins de la circulation routi\u00e8re. La compagnie de chemin de fer proposa que le viaduc soit ferm\u00e9 et que la voie routi\u00e8re soit d\u00e9tourn\u00e9e pour passer sous un pont de chemin de fer qui se trouvait non loin. La province, qui avait assum\u00e9 la responsabilit\u00e9 pour la voie routi\u00e8re, donna son consentement. La Commission autorisa le d\u00e9tournement de la voie routi\u00e8re et adjugea qu'elle n'avait pas la jurisdiction pour autoriser une contribution \u00e0 ce projet de la part de la Caisse des passages \u00e0 niveau de chemins de fer. La province a donc \u00e9t\u00e9 cotis\u00e9e pour le plein montant des frais \u00e0 l'exception de $5,000 qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 offerts par la compagnie de chemins de fer. La province a obtenu la permission d'en appeler devant cette Cour.\nArr\u00eat: L'appel doit \u00eatre maintenu.\nLe viaduc ne r\u00e9pondait plus aux besoins de la circulation. Le d\u00e9tournement propos\u00e9 \u00e9tait plus efficace et moins dispendieux que si on \u00e9largissait le viaduc. Ce d\u00e9tournement \u00e9tait une am\u00e9lioration de croisements de voies superpos\u00e9es en existence dans le sens de l'art. 265(1) (b) de la Loi sur les chemins de fer, et en cons\u00e9quence, la Commission avait le pouvoir d'autoriser une contribution \u00e0 ce projet de la part de la Caisse des passages \u00e0 niveau de chemins de fer.\nAPPEL d'une d\u00e9cision de la Commission des Transports du Canada. Appel maintenu.\nAPPEAL from an order of the Board of Transport Commissioners for Canada. Appeal allowed.\nJean Turgeon, Q.C., for the appellants.\nK. D. M. Spence, Q.C., for the respondent.\nM. M. Goldberg, for the Board.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nABBOTT J.:\u2014This is an appeal by leave, from Order No. 114705 of the Board of Transport Commissioners dated June 12, 1964, apportioning the cost of construction of a deviation of a highway and the closing of a subway under the tracks of the respondent. Inter alia, the said order had the effect of dismissing the application of the appellant, the Minister of Roads of the Province of Quebec, for a contribution from the Railway Grade Crossing Fund under s. 265 of the Railway Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 234, towards the cost of the said work. No appeal has been taken against that part of the said order directing the respondent to pay $5,000 towards the cost of the said work and to close the subway at its own expense.\nBy Order No. 33284 dated January 8, 1923, upon application of the Village of Pont Rouge in the County of Portneuf, Province of Quebec, the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada ordered the railway company to construct a subway under its tracks to eliminate a level highway crossing in the said Village.\nIn 1958 the County of Portneuf, finding the subway inadequate for highway traffic, applied to the Board of Transport Commissioners for an order authorizing the enlargement of the subway. The railway company submitted that instead of the subway being enlarged it should be closed and the highway diverted some five hundred feet, to pass under a nearby railway bridge which crossed the Jacques Cartier river.\nThe Department of Roads of the Province, having taken over from the County the responsibility for the highway, agreed to this proposal, and asked the Board to authorize the project. The Department estimated the cost of the diversion at $113,190, and it asked that this be paid 50 per cent by the Railway Grade Crossing Fund, 15 per cent by Canadian Pacific Railway Company and the remainder by the Department of Roads, with costs of maintenance of the new road to be the responsibility of the Department.\nBy Order No. 111583 dated June 28, 1963, the Board authorized the Department of Roads to construct and maintain the said deviation of the highway, and reserved the question of allocation of cost for further consideration and order of the Board.\nIn subsequent correspondence between the parties and the Board upon the question of allocation of cost the railway company stated its willingness to contribute the full value of the benefit that it would receive from the project. This benefit consisted of relief from the future cost of maintenance of the subway that was to be closed, which the railway company estimated at a capitalized amount of $5,000. In this correspondence the Board also questioned its own authority under s. 265 of the Railway Act to authorize a contribution to the project from the Railway Grade Crossing Fund, but as this point did not involve the railway company the respondent made no submissions thereon.\nThe matter of apportionment of the cost of the project was set down for public hearing and heard by the Board in Quebec City on May 5,1964. On June 12, 1964, concurrently with Order No. 114705 which is the subject of this appeal, Deputy Chief Commissioner Dumontier delivered reasons for judgment concurred in by Commissioner Woodard. After an examination of the relevant facts, the nature of the project, the provisions of s. 265 and the arguments of the parties, he held, (1) that he was unable to find in the Railway Act the power and jurisdiction to authorize a grant from the Railway Grade Crossing Fund and (2) that the offer of the railway company to contribute $5,000 representing the value of its relief from the cost of future maintenance of the subway was fair and reasonable, and that the remainder of the cost should be paid by the Department of Roads.\nUpon application of the Attorney General of Quebec and the Minister of Roads for leave to appeal, counsel for the applicants stated that the proposed appeal was directed only to the question of the Board's power to authorize a contribution from the Railway Grade Crossing Fund, and that no appeal was proposed against the amount ordered by the Board to be paid by the railway company. Counsel for the railway company thereupon stated that as the railway company was not involved in the issue to be raised it would have no purpose or interest in opposing the appeal and would not do so.\nLeave to appeal to this Court was granted by Hall J. upon the following question of law:\n\"Did the board of Transport Commissioners for Canada err in holding, as it did by its judgment of June 12, 1964, that it had neither the power nor the jurisdiction under section 265 (1)(b) of the Railway Act to authorize a grant from the Railway Grade Crossing Fund towards the cost of the work authorized by its Order 111583?\"\nThe relevant portions of s. 265 of the Railway Act are as follows:\n265. (1) The sums heretofore or hereafter appropriated and set apart to aid actual construction work for the protection, safety and convenience of the public in respect of crossings shall be placed to the credit of a special account to be known as \"The Railway Grade Crossing Fund\", and shall, insofar as not already applied, be applied by the Board in its discretion, subject to the limitations set forth in this section, solely towards the cost, not including that of maintenance and operation, of\n(a) work actually done for the protection, safety and convenience of the public in respect of existing crossings at rail level,\n(b) work actually done in respect of reconstruction and improvement of grade separations that are in existence at crossings upon the coming into force of this subsection and that, in the opinion of the Board, are not adequate, by reason of their location, design or size, for the highway traffic using them, and\n(c) placing reflective marking on the sides of railway cars.\n***\n(9) In this section, \"crossing\" means any railway crossing of a highway, or any highway crossing of a railway, and every manner of construction of the railway or of the highway by the elevation or the depression of the one above or below the other, or by the diversion of one or the other, and any work ordered or authorized by the Board to be provided as one work for the protection, safety and convenience of the public in respect of one or more railways of as many tracks crossing or so crossed as the Board in its discretion determines.\nThe sole issue in this appeal is whether the highway diversion referred to, was an improvement of an existing grade separation within the meaning of s. 265 (1) (b) of the Railway Act.\nUnder the provisions of ss. 39 and 266 of the said Act, the Board is vested with exclusive authority to authorize grade crossing changes and to apportion the cost of making such changes.\nThe \"Railway Grade Crossing Fund\" consists of monies voted from time to time by Parliament. The Fund was established to provide financial assistance to the railways and to local authorities towards the cost of the construction, reconstruction and improvement of grade crossings, required for the protection, safety and convenience of the public and made necessary by changing traffic conditions. Within the limits set by the Act the contribution, if any, to be made out of the Fund to the cost of a particular work, is fixed by the Board.\nIn the present case the existing subway facilities at Pont Rouge admittedly had become inadequate. The diversion proposed by the railway company was more efficient and less costly than it would have been to enlarge the existing underpass. In my opinion this diversion is an improvement of an existing grade separation within the meaning of s. 265 (1) (b) and that in consequence the Board is empowered to authorize a grant from the Railway Grade Crossing Fund towards the cost of the work authorized by its Order No. 111583.\nI would allow the appeal and answer the question submitted in the affirmative. That portion of Order No. 114705 requiring that the cost of constructing the work in question in excess of $5,000 be paid by appellant, is therefore set aside and the matter referred back to the Board.\nThe appeal was argued immediately after another appeal in which the same parties were involved. In the circumstances, there should be no order as to costs.\nAppeal allowed; no order as to costs.\nAttorney for the appellants: J. Turgeon, Quebec.\nAttorney for the respondent: K. D. M. Spence, Ottawa.\n",

The Exchequer Court rejected the registration on the grounds that it was confusing and was not distinctive. The appellant appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nThe first impression test is the test which should be used in determining the issue of whether a trade mark is confusing, but it should not be applied by separating the syllables and finding that there is in each of them the same syllable without referring to the variations between the two marks and the order in which that syllable appears in each mark to determine whether they are phonetically confusing. Applying this test, the average person, not skilled in semantics, going into the market to purchase a dandruff remover and hair tonic, could not be phonetically confused.\nBoth the words \"Resdan\" and \"Dandress\" adopt a part of the word \"dandruff\" and, nothing could be more ordinary in the trade than the word \"dandruff\". The opposition by the respondent to the use of the syllable \"dand\" would effect the wholesale appropriation of the only apt language available. General Motors Corpn. v. Bellows, 10 CPR. 101. Under the circumstances, the proposed trade mark was distinctive.

La Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier a ray\u00e9 l'enregistrement pour les motifs que la marque cr\u00e9ait de la confusion et n'\u00e9tait pas distinctive. L'appelante en appela devant cette Cour.\nArr\u00eat: L'appel doit \u00eatre maintenu.\nLe crit\u00e8re de la premi\u00e8re impression est le crit\u00e8re dont on doit se servir pour d\u00e9terminer la question de savoir si une marque de commerce cr\u00e9e de la confusion, mais on ne doit pas s'en servir en s\u00e9parant les syllabes de telle sorte que l'on trouve qu'il y a dans chacune la m\u00eame syllabe sans se r\u00e9f\u00e9rer aux variations entre les deux marques et \u00e0 l'ordre dans lequel cette syllabe appara\u00eet dans chacune pour d\u00e9terminer si phon\u00e9tiquement elles cr\u00e9ent de la confusion. Appliquant ce crit\u00e8re, l'homme moyen, non qualifi\u00e9 en science s\u00e9mantique, achetant un produit pour enlever les pellicules du cuir chevelu et un tonique pour les cheveux, ne pourrait pas \u00eatre phon\u00e9tiquement port\u00e9 \u00e0 la confusion.\nLes deux mots \u00ab Resdan \u00bb et \u00ab Dandress \u00bb adoptent une partie du mot \u00ab dandruff \u00bb et on ne peut trouver aucun mot dans ce commerce qui soit plus ordinaire que le mot \u00ab dandruff \u00bb.

Appel maintenu.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Dumoulin J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada[2] , reversing a decision of the Registrar of Trade Marks. Appeal allowed.\nW. B. Williston, Q.C., for the appellant.\nCuthbert Scott, Q.C., and D. W. Scott for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nSPENCE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Exchequer Court1 delivered by Dumoulin J. on March 11, 1964, allowing an appeal from the decision of the Registrar of Trade Marks made on February 7, 1962, and rejecting the application of the appellant for registration of a trade mark. William Sorokolit had applied to the Registrar of Trade Marks for the registration of the word \"DANDRESS\" as a proposed trade mark in association with a dandruff remover, hair dressing and conditioner. Sorokolit subsequently as-signed the application for the registration to the appellant. The respondent Whitehall having received notice of the said application, filed opposition thereto.\nThe Registrar, in his decision, said:\nI have considered the evidence on file, there being no oral Hearing and, having regard to all the circumstances, I have arrived at the decision that the two marks in their totalities are not confusing and that their concurrent use in the same area would not be likely to lead to the inference that the wares emanate from the same person.\nFrom this decision, the respondent appealed to the Exchequer Court. Dumoulin J., in his reasons for judgment, considered the attack upon the proposed trade mark under two headings. Firstly, that it was confusing with a registered trade mark, and secondly, that it was not distinctive.\nSection 37(2) of the Trade Marks Act, Statutes of Canada, 1952-1953, c. 49, provides:\n37. (2) Such opposition may be based on any of the following grounds:\n***\n(b) that the trade mark is not registerable;\n***\n(d) that the trade mark is not distinctive.\nSection 12(1) of the Trade Marks Act provides:\n12. (1) Subject to section 13, a trade mark is registerable if it is not\n***\n(d) confusing with a registered trade mark;\n***\nAnd section 6(2) of the statute provides as follows:\n6. (2) The use of a trade mark causes confusion with another trade mark if the use of both trade marks in the same area would be likely to lead to the inference that the wares or services associated with such trade marks are manufactured, sold, leased, hired or performed by the same person, whether or not such wares or services are of the same general class.\nSubsection (5) of the same section directs the Court or the Registrar that in determining whether trade marks or trade names are confusing to have regard to all the surrounding circumstances, including:\n(a) the inherent distinctiveness of the trade marks or trade names and the extent to which they have become known;\n(b) the length of time the trade marks or trade names have been in use; (c) the nature of the wares, services or business;\n(d) the nature of the trade; and\n(e) the degree of resemblance between the trade marks or trade names in appearance or sound or in the ideas suggested by them.\nDumoulin J. referred to the said s. 6, subs. (5), and dealt particularly with para. (e) thereof, being of the opinion that for the purpose of determining whether the degree of resemblance between the proposed trade mark and the existing trade mark with which it was alleged to be confusing in appearance or sound, or in the idea suggested by them, was largely a matter of first impression, citing Kerwin J. in Battle Pharmaceuticals v. British Drug Houses Ltd.[3], and used what he described as that touchstone to determine that \"RESDAN\", the trade mark which was the property of the respondent, and \"DANDRESS\", the trade mark proposed by the appellant, sound phonetically confusing, at least on first impression. I agree that the first impression test is the test which should be used in determining the issue of whether the trade mark is confusing, but I am of the opinion that it should not be applied by separating the syllables and finding that there is in each of them the same syllable without referring to the variations between the two marks and the order in which that syllable appears in each mark to determine whether they are phonetically confusing. I adopt here the view of Thorson P. in Sealy Sleep Products Ltd. v. Simpson's-Sears Ltd.[4], as follows:\nThe principle thus stated is as applicable in cases under the Trade Marks Act as it was in cases under the Unfair Competition Act. And its converse is equally true. It is not a proper approach to the determination of whether one trade mark is confusing with another to break them up into their elements, concentrate attention upon the elements that are similar and conclude that, because there are similarities in the trade marks, the trade marks as a whole are confusing with another. Trade marks may be different from one another and, therefore, not confusing with one another when looked at in their totality, even if there are similiarities in some of the elements when viewed separately. It is the combination of the elements that constitutes the trade mark and it is the effect of the trade mark as a whole, rather than that of any particular part in it, that must be considered.\nIf one avoids slicing up the two words, presuming they may be considered words, and speaks each so-called word then, in my view, there can be no phonetic confusion. I come to this conclusion realizing that the test to be applied is with the average person who goes into the market and not one skilled in semantics. In expressing my view, I am putting myself in the position of the average person going into the market to purchase a dandruff remover and hair tonic.\nIs the proposed trade mark \"DANDRESS\" distinctive? Section 2(f) defines \"distinctive\" as follows:\n(f) \"distinctive\" in relation to a trade mark means a trade mark that actually distinguishes the wares or services in association with which it is used by its owner from the wares or services of others or is adapted so to distinguish them;\nRand J., in giving the judgment of the majority in General Motors Corporation v. Bellows[5], approved of the submission by Mr. Fox that when a trader adopts words in common use for his trade name some risk of confusion is inevitable. It is quite evident that both the words \"RESDAN\" and \"DANDRESS\" adopt a part of the word \"dandruff\" and, of course, nothing can be more ordinary in the trade than the word \"dandruff\". I am of the opinion that the opposition by the respondent to the use of the syllable \"dand\" would, in the language of Rand J. in General Motors v. Bellows, supra, \"effect the wholesale appropriation of the only apt language available\". I am, therefore, of the opinion that under the circumstances the proposed trade mark \"DANDRESS\" is distinctive.\nI would allow the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: R. H. Saffrey, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Scott & Aylen, Ottawa.\n[1] [1964] Ex. C.R. 913, 26 Fox Pat. C. 177, 42 C.P.R. 3.\n[2] [1964] Ex. C.R. 913, 26 Fox Pat.

On the morning immediately following the slaying, he called for the mounted police and made a series of statements in which he made a complete and detailed con\u00adfession of the crime. At the trial, the appellant gave evidence on his own behalf and claimed that the statements made immediately after the crime were false, that they had been made to protect a friend and that he had not killed the guard. His conviction was affirmed by a majority judgment in the Court of Appeal. All the members of the Court were of the opinion that the judge's charge to the jury was inadequate, but the majority was of the opinion that there had been no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice and applied s. 592(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code. The appellant appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Taschereau C.J. and Abbott and Judson JJ. dissenting) : The appeal should be allowed and a new trial directed.\nPer Cartwright and Hall JJ.: The trial judge failed to present the theory of the defence to the jury, and the verdict could not be upheld by the application of s. 592 (1) (b) (iii) of the Code. The onus was upon the Crown to satisfy the Court that the verdict would necessarily have been the same if the errors had not occurred. The construction of s. 592 (1)(b)(iii) of the Code contended for by the Crown in this case would transfer from the jury to the Court of Appeal the question whether the evidence established the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. It was impossible to affirm from a reading of the written record that the testimony of the accused might not have left a properly instructed jury in a state of doubt.\nIn this view of the case it was not necessary to consider the ground of appeal which was based on the allegedly improper cross-examination of the accused.\nAs to the first two grounds of appeal, they were properly rejected by the Court of Appeal. Per Ritchie J.: The trial judge erred in failing to fairly put to the jury the defence made by the accused. It was impossible to say that the verdict would necessarily have been the same if the charge had been correct and, applying the test established in the authorities, this was not a case in which the provisions of s. 592(1)(b) (iii) of the Code should be invoked. The errors in this case were not of a minor character.\nPer Spence J.: The first ground of appeal that the trial judge erred in allowing the trial while the accused was dressed as a prison inmate, and the second ground that the trial judge should not have admitted in evidence a tape recording, were both properly rejected by the Court of Appeal.\nAs to the ground that the trial judge had erred in allowing the admission, on cross-examination of the accused, of evidence of his previous conduct and criminal offences, there had been no prejudice to the accused. Even if the questions put upon cross-examination were inadmissible and prejudicial, the answers resulted in the only evidence being that the accused had never been convicted or charged with a crime in which he carried or wielded a knife.\nThe ground of appeal that the trial judge failed to fairly put to the jury the defence made by the accused should be upheld. It is the duty of the trial judge to outline to the jury the theory of the defence and to give to the jury matters of evidence essential in arriving at a just conclusion in reference to that defence. The charge in the present case, in its failure to state the theory of the defence, and particularly in the partial statement of it accompanied by the inferential disbelief of it and not accompanied by any reference to evidence which bore upon it, was a failure to properly instruct the jury and was prejudicial to the accused.\nUnder s. 592(1)(b) (iii) of the Criminal Code, the onus was on the Crown to satisfy the Court that the jury, charged as it should have been, could not, as reasonable men, have done otherwise than to find the appellant guilty. This Court could not place itself in the position of a. jury and weigh the various pieces of evidence which it was the duty of the trial judge to submit to the jury and which he failed to do. There was a possibility that the jury, properly charged, would have had a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused. Therefore, this Court could not apply the provisions of s. 592 (1)(b) (iii) to affirm the conviction.\nPer Taschereau C.J. and Abbott and Judson JJ., dissenting: The charge to the jury was adequate in the circumstances of this case. The defence which was merely that the accused had lied in his confessions and had told the truth at the trial, was put to the jury and they were fully instructed on the subject of reasonable doubt. Such error as there may have been in the conduct of the trial was of a minor character, and the Court of Appeal was justified in applying s. 592 (1) (b) (iii) of the Code.

Appel maintenu, le Juge en Chef Taschereau et les Juges Abbott et Judson \u00e9tant dissidents.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, affirming a conviction of capital murder. Appeal allowed, Taschereau C.J. and Abbott and Judson JJ. dis\u00adsenting.\nP. S. Creaghan, for the appellant.\nL. D. D'Arcy, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Taschereau C.J. and Abbott and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nABBOTT J. (dissenting) :\u2014With deference to those who hold the opposite view, in my opinion the charge to the jury was adequate in the circumstances of this case.\nThe theory of the defence was a simple one. It was merely that the accused had lied in the three confessions made by him and had told the truth in his evidence at the trial. That defence was put to the jury and they were fully instructed on the subject of reasonable doubt.\nSuch error as there may have been in the conduct of the trial was of a minor character and for the reasons given by Bridges C.J., the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, in my opinion, was justified in applying the provisions of s. 592(1) (b) (iii) of the Criminal Code.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nThe judgment of Cartwright and Hall JJ. was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014The relevant facts and the course of the proceedings in the courts below are set out in the rea\u00adsons of my brother Spence. I agree with his conclusion that the learned trial judge failed to present the theory of the defence to the jury and with his reasons for reaching that conclusion; but since we are differing from the opinion of the majority in the Court of Appeal I propose to set out shortly in my own words my reasons for holding that in this case the verdict of guilty cannot be upheld by the application of s. 592(1) (b) (iii) of the Criminal Code.\nSection 592(1) (a) (ii) of the Criminal Code reads:\n592 (1) On the hearing of an appeal against a conviction, the court of appeal (a) may allow the appeal where it is of the opinion that ... .\n(ii) the judgment of the trial court should be set aside on the ground of a wrong decision on a question of law, or ... .\nSection 592(1) (b) (iii) reads:\n(b) may dismiss the appeal where ... .\n(iii) notwithstanding that, the court is of the opinion that on any ground mentioned in subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (a) the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, it is of the opinion that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred;\nA number of authorities which should guide the Court of Appeal in deciding whether, misdirection having been shewn, it can safely be affirmed that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred are quoted in the rea\u00adsons of my brother Spence. Upon reading these it will be observed that, once error in law has been found to have occurred at the trial, the onus resting upon the Crown is to satisfy the Court that the verdict would necessarily have been the same if such error had not occurred. The satisfac\u00adtion of this onus is a condition precedent to the right of the Appellate Court to apply the terms of the subsection at all. The Court is not bound to apply the subsection merely because this onus is discharged.\nUnder our system of law a man on trial for his life is entitled to the verdict of a jury which has been accurately and adequately instructed as to the law. The construction of s. 592(1) (b) (iii) contended for by the Crown in this case would transfer from the jury to the Court of Appeal the question whether the evidence established the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. To adapt the words of Lord Herschell in Makin v. Attorney General for New South Wales[1], the judges would in truth be substituted for the jury, the verdict would become theirs and theirs alone, and would be arrived at upon a perusal of the evidence without any opportunity of seeing the demeanour of the wit\u00adnesses and weighing the evidence with the assistance which this affords. In the case at bar every judge in the Court of Appeal was of the same opinion as my brother Spence that the charge of the learned trial judge to the jury was inadequate. The evidence of the accused given at the trial, if it were believed by the jury, established his innocence; if it left the jury in a state of doubt it necessitated his acquittal. I find it impossi\u00adble to affirm from a reading of the written record that the testimony of the accused might not have left a properly instructed jury in a state of doubt, and consequently, in my view, the verdict must be set aside.\nThe conclusion at which I have arrived on this ground of appeal renders it unnecessary for me to consider the fourth ground of appeal, which was based on the allegedly improp\u00ader cross-examination of the accused, and I express no opin\u00adion upon it.\nI agree with my brother Spence that grounds (1) and (2), set out at the commencement of his reasons, were properly rejected.\nI would dispose of the appeal as proposed by my brother Spence.\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014I have had the benefit of reading the rea\u00adsons for judgment of my brothers Cartwright and Spence and I agree with them that this appeal should be allowed on the ground that \"the learned trial judge erred in failing to fairly put to the jury the defence made by the accused\".\nEven if it be conceded to be improbable that the decision of any juror was affected by the errors which all the judges of the court of appeal have found to have existed in the charge of the learned trial judge, I am nevertheless unable to say that the verdict would necessarily have been the same if the charge had been correct and, applying the test established in the authorities referred to by my brother Spence, I do not consider this to be a case in which the provisions of s. 592(1) (b) (iii) of the Criminal Code should be invoked. I do not share the view that the errors referred to were of a minor character. I would accordingly dispose of this appeal as proposed by my brother Spence.\nSPENCE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick which, by a majority of two to one, dismissed the appeal of the appellant from his conviction upon a charge of capital murder. The appellant in this Court submitted in his notice of appeal five grounds as follows:\n(1) The learned Trial Judge erred in allowing the Trial to commence and proceed while the accused was present before the Jury attired and identifiable as a convicted criminal or a person of bad repute.\n(2) The learned Trial Judge erred in allowing to be admitted in evidence a tape recording allegedly reproducing a confession made by the accused and solicited by the police.\n(3) The learned Trial Judge erred in failing to fairly put to the Jury the defence made by the accused.\n(4) The learned Trial Judge erred in allowing the admission, on cross-examination of the accused, of evidence of his previous conduct and criminal offences,\n(5) The Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division, erred in dismissing the appeal by the appellant herein to that Honourable Court.\nThe first four of those grounds were presented to the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick. As' to grounds 1 and 2, the judgment of Limerick J.A., although dissenting on other grounds, was adopted by the majority of the Court, and I am of the opinion that I need not add anything to the very convincing reasons delivered by ' the learned justice in appeal in reference to those grounds.\nI turn next to consider ground 4, i.e.:\nThe learned Trial Judge erred in allowing the admission, on cross-examina\u00adtion of the accused, of evidence of his previous conduct and criminal offences.\nThe appellant's objection is to his cross-examination. Since it is very short, it is my intention to quote it completely:\nQ. Now how long have you been in the \u2014 how many times have you been in the \u2014 an inmate at the penitentiary? A. This is the second time. Q. The second time? A. Yes.\nQ. And what are you in for this time? A. Armed robbery. Q. Armed robbery? A. Right.\nQ. And how were you armed on that occasion? A. With a gun.\nQ. And what was the first time you served penitentiary \u2014 what was that for? A. For escaping gaol, car theft, and breaking and enter.\nQ. And had you served any sentence besides penitentiary? A. Yes. Q. And where did you serve these? A. County Gaol.\nQ. When did you first serve time in the County Gaol? A. 1962.\nQ, Did you use a knife in any offence before? A. No.\nQ. Were you not involved in the Friar's hold-up? A. Mmmm. Q. Was not a knife used there? A. Prove I used it.\nQ. Pardon? A. Prove I used it. I didn't use it.\nQ. Did you have a knife? A. No.\nQ. What weapon did you have? A. I had nothing.\nQ, Did you plead guilty to a charge of armed robbery? A. Mmmm, but I didn't plead guilty to having a knife.\nQ. What were you armed with? A. I was armed with nothing. My accomplice was armed.\nThe Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 307, provides in s. 12(1):\nA witness may be questioned as to whether he has been convicted of any offence, and upon being so questioned, if he either denies the fact or refuses to answer, the opposite party may prove such conviction.\nHere counsel for the Crown went much farther.\nCartwright J. in Lizotte v. The King[2], quoted with approval the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Noor Mohamed v. The King[3], as follows:\nIn Makin v. Attorney General for New South Wales (1894) A.C. 57, 65, Lord Herschell L.C. delivering the judgment of the Board, laid down two principles which must be observed in a case of this character. Of these the first was that \"it is undoubtedly not competent for the prosecution to adduce evidence tending to show that the accused has been guilty of criminal acts other than those covered by the indictment, for the purpose of leading to the conclusion that the accused is a person likely from his criminal conduct or character to have committed the offence for which he is being tried\". In 1934 this principle was said by Lord Sankey L.C., with the concurrence of all the noble and learned Lords who sat with him, to be \"one of the most deeply rooted and jealously guarded principles of our criminal law\" and to be \"fundamental in the law of evidence as conceived in this country\". (Maxwell v. The Director of Public Prosecutions [1935] A.C. 309, 317, 320.)\nThat statement, however, was made in reference to cross-examination by the Crown counsel of a defence witness who was not the accused person.\nIn Rex v. MacDonald[4], the Ontario Court of Appeal was considering an appeal from the conviction of the appellant for murder. Objection was made to the Crown's examina\u00adtion-in-chief of a Crown witness who was a person closely associated with the accused and who had, after the accused was alleged to have committed the crime, given the accused shelter in his residence. It was objected that such examina\u00adtion was irrelevant and that it was harmful to the appellant in that it tended to show that the appellant was associated with confirmed criminals. Robertson C.J.O. said at pp. 196-7:\nWith respect to all the evidence of the kind objected to, the rules are well established. On the trial of a criminal charge the character and record in general of the accused are not matters in issue, and are not proper subjects of evidence against him. If evidence of good character is given on behalf of the accused, then certain evidence of bad character may be given, but that is not of importance in this case for the appellant offered no evidence of good character.\nFurther, if the accused becomes a witness, as he has the right to do, he may be cross-examined as to any previous conviction, and if he does not admit it, it may be proved against him. As a witness, the accused is also subject to cross-examination as to matters affecting his credibility in the same way as another witness. Except for this, the character and record of the accused are not proper subjects of attack by the Crown, and it is clearly improper for the Crown to adduce evidence, by cross-examination or otherwise, with a view to putting it before the jury that the accused has been \"associated with others in a long and serious criminal career\". The accused person is to be convicted, if at all, upon evidence relevant to the crime with which he is charged, and not upon his character or past record.\nIt must be noted that this statement was made not upon an occasion when the cross-examination of the accused person was being considered but rather when the examina\u00adtion-in-chief of a Crown witness was being considered and, with respect, I view the learned Chief Justice's inclusion of the former situation by his words \"by cross-examination or otherwise\" as being obiter. I am further of the opinion that a cross-examination of an accused person which indicated that he had been \"associated with others in a long and serious criminal career\" would be perfectly admissible cross-examination upon the issue of the credibility of that accused person. However, I am of the opinion that permission to cross-examine the accused person as to his character on the issue of the accused person's credibility is within the discre\u00adtion of the trial judge and the trial judge should exercise that discretion with caution and should exclude evidence, even if it were relevant upon the credibility of the accused, if its prejudicial effect far outweighs its probative value.\nI am further of the opinion that in the particular case the issue does not arise for the reason that even if the questions put upon cross-examination by the Crown counsel were inadmissible and prejudicial the answers resulted in the only evidence being that the accused man had never been con\u00advicted or charged with a crime in which he carried or wielded a knife and, further, the accused man invited the Crown to prove otherwise, an invitation which the Crown did not deem it advisable to accept. There was, therefore, in the particular case, no prejudice to the accused.\nThe third ground of appeal :\nThe learned Trial Judge erred in failing to fairly put to the jury the defence made by the accused.\nis a much more substantial one. The appellant, on the morning immediately following the slaying of the prison guard for which he was charged with capital murder, had called for the attendance of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and had made a series of statements, some in his own handwriting, some in answer to questions, and one, the tape recording, which was the subject of ground of appeal no. 2. In these statements, the appellant had made a complete and detailed confession of the crime in such a fashion that if these statements were not explained, they would constitute a sound basis for his conviction upon the offence as charged. The appellant gave evidence at trial on his own behalf, under circumstances to which I shall refer hereafter. In that evidence, he admitted the voluntary nature of all the statements aforesaid. But he denied their truth. In reply to questions by his own counsel, he said that he had not killed the guard and that he had given the statements \"to protect a friend\", and continued, \"and that certain friend gave evidence against me and I don't see no reason for protecting him now. I seen that certain person do that. I was standing no more than four feet away from him at the time\". In cross-examination, the accused repeated that explanation and gave great detail saying, inter alia, \"I was going to protect him even to the point of hanging for him until he tried to hang me\".\nAlthough the appellant refused to name that other person, it would appear from his evidence, taken with the other evidence at trial, that it could only have been his fellow inmate Westerberg, who had testified as a Crown witness.\nUpon the cross-examination of the appellant having been completed, the trial was adjourned from 5.49 p.m. until 10.00 a.m., the next morning. At that time counsel for the appellant addressed the jury and in a very brief address mentioned that the appellant denied killing the prison guard but would not incriminate others. He failed to make any reference to the appellant's explanation of his confes\u00adsions to the police. The Crown counsel followed with an address in which he analyzed the evidence in very considera\u00adble detail but again I find no reference to the reasons assigned by the appellant in his evidence for what he alleged in that evidence were the false confessions he had given to the police officers.\nThe learned trial judge in his charge to the jury dealt with the theory of the defence in the following fashion:\nI take it, as one of the theories of the defence anyway, that the accused does not wish you to believe these statements as being true. That is what he said on the stand\u2014he denies them; he said he was not telling the truth when he gave those statements. And :\nIn other words all the statements he made, including the tape recording\u2014and this is in the evidence as well\u2014the oral statements that he made to the R.C.M.P., according to the evidence that Colpitts gave yesterday if you believe it,\u2014all this is a pack of lies, according to Colpitts.\nNow gentlemen, it is up to you, because you are the sole masters of the facts. You use your good judgment that the Lord gave you, your knowledge of human nature, to say which of the two alternatives is the more logical one, in order to ascertain if Colpitts was lying yesterday on the stand or if he was lying when he made those statements in a con\u00adtinuous operation the very morning after the stabbing of the guard.\nAnd further:\nAnd the Crown prosecutor has asked you\u2014is it logical to believe that, after having called for the Mounted Police, as you know he did\u2014if you believe the evidence\u2014that he would lie, and lie, and lie throughout these written statements, throughout the tape recording, throughout the oral statements, throughout the visit he made to the prison yard when he showed the constables those details of the occurrence. Well, it is for you to say, gentlemen, if it is logical or not. Isn't it more logical that he would have told the truth on that occasion and that after two months of deliberation he would have concocted the story that he insisted on telling you yesterday? I am not going to give you my opinion on it. You are the men to decide which is the more logical of those two alternatives. You are the twelve men who will decide this.\nTo summarize the above, the learned trial judge put it as the theory of the appellant that he had made a false confession, and never mentioned the reason which the appellant gave in his evidence for having done so, a reason to which the appellant held fast through a vigorous cross-examination. It must be remembered that counsel for the appellant, before calling the appellant as the only witness for the defence, stated to the learned trial judge, in the presence of the jury:\nMR. O'NEILL: My Lord, yes, I am going to call one witness for the defence; and that will be Reginald Colpitts, the accused. And, Sir, I must\u2014as a matter of professional ethics\u2014do assert that this is going to happen against my better judgment and counsel. But Mr. Colpitts has decided to take the stand, and I\u2014of couse [sic] \u2014will act as examiner.\nTHE COURT: All right. I understand your position.\nAs I have pointed out above, the learned trial judge in his charge gave to the jury two conclusions suggesting that they choose the more logical, and one of them was framed in the words \"and that after two months of deliberation he would have concocted the story that he insisted on telling you yesterday\". I am of the opinion that that portion of the charge, when considered in the light of the remarks of the then counsel for the appellant which I have quoted, could only suggest, and strongly suggest, to the jury that they could place no reliance upon the evidence given by the appellant in his defence. Moreover, the learned trial judge failed to discuss any of the evidence adduced by the Crown which might be related to that defence. As Limerick J.A. in his reasons has referred to the many instances of evidence which are related to the theory of the defence, I need not repeat them. None of these instances were discussed in that light in the charge of the learned trial judge.\nIt is trite law that it is the duty of the trial judge to outline to the jury the theory of the defence and that even in cases where the accused person does not give evidence on his own behalf : Kelsey v. The Queen[5], where it was held that the trial judge had done so; Derek Clayton-Wright[6], per Goddard L.C.J. at 29.\nRecent decisions in this Court and elsewhere have also emphasized the duty of the trial judge in his charge to go further and to not only outline the theory of the defence but to give to the jury matters of evidence essential in arriving at a just conclusion in reference to that defence.\nIn Lizotte v. The King[7], Cartwright J., giving judgment for the Court, said at p. 131:\nI do respectfully venture to suggest that in this case it would have been well to follow the usual practice of indicating to the jury the nature of the evidence put forward in support of the alibi and telling them that, even if they are not satisfied that the alibi has been proved, if the evidence in support of it raises in their minds a reasonable doubt of the appellant's guilt, it is their duty to acquit him.\nIn Azoulay v. The Queen[8], the present Chief Justice of this Court said: On the second point, I agree with the Chief Justice of the Court of King's Bench. The rule which has been laid down, and consistently followed is that in a jury trial the presiding judge must, except in rare cases where it would be needless to do so, review the substantial parts of the evidence, and give the jury the theory of the defence, so that they may appreciate the value and effect of that evidence, and how the law is to be applied to the facts as they find them.\nIn Lizotte v. The Queen[9], the present Chief Justice of this Court said:\nAu cours de sa charge aux jur\u00e9s, le juge pr\u00e9sidant au proc\u00e8s, apr\u00e8s avoir r\u00e9cit\u00e9 certains faits saillants de cette triste aventure, semble avoir omis quelques \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, essentiels pour arriver \u00e0 une juste conclusion. Sans doute, il n'est pas imp\u00e9ratif que le juge d\u00e9crive en d\u00e9tail toutes et chacune des circonstances qui ont entour\u00e9 un crime, mais encore faut-il qu'il place devant le jury tout ce qui est r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 par les t\u00e9moignages, soit de la Couronne ou de la d\u00e9fense, qui peut \u00eatre un moyen s\u00e9rieux de disculper l'accus\u00e9. (Le Roi v. Azoulay, [1952] 2 S.C.R. 495); (Le Roi v, Kelsey, [19531 1 S.C.R. 220); (Vide Lord Goddard in Dereck Clayton-Wright (1948), 33 C.A.R. 22 at 29.)\nIn Regina v. Hladiy[10], Pickup C.J.O. said:\nThe learned trial judge then went on to discuss the evidence as to motive and also discussed the statements made by the accused, but no\u2014where in his charge, in discussing that evidence, did he put it plainly to the jury that, in considering the statements made by the accused, or such of them as the jury believed, they should consider whether they had any reasonable doubt as to whether or not what actually took place that night before the body was thrown into the water was murder.\nIn Markadonis v. The King[11], Davis J. said at p. 665:\nMoreover, I cannot escape from the view that the charge of the learned trial judge did not present certain aspects of the case in favour of the accused that should have been dealt with and considered.\nIn the light of these authorities, I agree with the conten\u00adtion of counsel for the appellant that the charge by the learned trial judge, in its failure to state the theory of the defence, and particularly in the partial statement of it accompanied by the inferential disbelief of it and not accompanied by any reference to evidence which bore upon it, was a failure to properly instruct the jury and was prejudicial to the accused. All the members of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Side, were of the same view. Bridges C.J., said:\nThe instructions which the learned judge gave to the jury to use their good judgment in deciding which of two alternatives was the more logical, namely, whether the defendant told the truth in his statements and on the tape recording or in his evidence at the trial, did not put the defence properly before the jury as such direction did not make it clear to them that if they were in doubt or believed the testimony of the defendant might reasonably be true they should acquit him.\nRitchie J.A. said:\nI also am of the opinion the theory of the defence as expressed in the appellant's evidence at trial was not adequately put to the jury \u2026\nAnd Limerick J.A. said :\nThis would seem to be a very inadequate presentation of the defence as well as a very negative approach thereto. Use of the words \"does not wish you to believe\" thereby, by inference, implying he, the learned Judge, thought the statements were true constitutes an opinion of guilt not a presentation of the defence.\nThe first two named justices, however, were of the opin\u00adion that the provisions of s. 592(1) (b) (iii) of the Criminal Code should be applied and that there had been \"no sub\u00adstantial wrong or miscarriage of justice\" and therefore that the appeal should be dismissed.\nIt is the contention of the appellant in his fifth ground of appeal that that decision was not a correct one. The applica\u00adtion of the subsection, as pointed out by the learned justice in appeal, has been considered frequently in this Court and I think it may be said that the decisions in Allen v. The King[12], Gouin v. The King[13], Brooks v. The King[14], Lizotte v. The King[15], and Schmidt v. The King[16], are authoritative.\nThe proposition in Allen v. The King as stated by Sir Charles Fitzpatrick, C.J., at p. 339, in reference to the section of the Code then if effect, was:\nI cannot agree that the effect of the section is to do more than, as I said before, give the judges on an appeal a discretion which they may be trusted to exercise only where the illegal evidence or other irregularities are so trivial that it may safely be assumed that the jury was not influenced by it.\nThat proposition has been considered in subsequent au\u00adthorities.\nIn Brooks v. The King, supra, in the judgment of the Court at p. 636, it is said:\nMisdirection in a material matter having been shewn, the onus was upon the Crown to satisfy the Court that the jury, charged as it should have been, could not, as reasonable men, have done otherwise than find the appellant guilty.\nIn Schmidt v. The King, supra, Kerwin J., at p. 440, put it this way :\nThe meaning of these words has been considered in this Court in several cases, one of which is Gouin v. The King [1926] S.C.R. 539, from all of which it is clear that the onus rests on the Crown to satisfy the Court that the verdict would necessarily have been the same if the charge had been correct or if no evidence has been improperly admitted.\nIn Lizotte v. The King, supra, Cartwright J. giving the judgment for the Court, held that it was within the jurisdic\u00adtion of this Court to allow an appeal and refuse to apply the provisions of the present s. 592(1) (b) (iii) despite the fact that the Court of Appeal in the province had dismissed the appeal from the conviction upon the application of the said subsection.\nTherefore, this Court must apply the test set out in the aforesaid cases and, to quote again from Brooks v. The King:\nThe onus is upon the Crown to satisfy the Court that the jury, charged as it should have been, could not, as reasonable men, have done otherwise than find the appellant guilty.\nIn an attempt to persuade this Court that upon such a test being applied the Court could not do otherwise than to find that a jury properly charged would hold the appellant guilty, counsel for the respondent cited many pieces of evidence which would tend to show that the appellant had told the truth when he made the statements to the police and had lied when he testified in court. As pointed out by the various learned justices in appeal in the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, this, even if true, would not be sufficient because if the evidence of the appellant at trial, although the jury is not convinced of its truth, raises a reasonable doubt in their minds, that reasonable doubt must be resolved in favour of the accused. Moreover, as pointed out by Limerick J.A. in his dissenting judgment in the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division, there are a very considerable number of items of evidence which point toward the possibility that the appellant might be telling the truth in his evidence at trial. In my view, it was the duty of the judge to submit all that evidence, not only that in favour of the accused but that against him, to the jury so that they might weigh it and come to the conclusion whether, on all of the evidence, they had any reasonable doubt of the guilt of the appellant.\nI am of the opinion that this Court cannot place itself in the position of a jury and weigh these various pieces of evidence. If there is any possibility that twelve reasonable men, properly charged, would have a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused, then this Court should not apply the provisions of s. 592(1) (b) (iii) to affirm a conviction.\nI am of the opinion that there is such a possibility and I, therefore, would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division, and direct a new trial of the appellant upon the charge of capital murder.\nAppeal allowed, new trial directed, Taschereau C.J. and Abbott and Judson JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitor for the appellant: P. S. Creaghan, Moncton.\nSolicitor for the respondent: L. D.

Ryan, [1965] S.C.R. 757\nDate: 1965-06-24\nRe The Estate of Catherine Agnes Martin, Deceased. Stewart MacGregor (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nDavid Stewart Ryan, surviving Executor of the Estate of Catherine Agnes Martin and Executor of the Last Will and Testament of Maud Ryan (Defendant) Respondent.\n1965: March 25; 1965: June 24.\nPresent: Cartwright, Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nWills\u2014Validity\u2014Allegation that testatrix lacked testamentary capacity\u2014Alternative allegation of undue influence\u2014Whether suspicion raised by circumstances surrounding execution of will dispelled\u2014Onus of proof.\nThe validity of the will of the testatrix, the effect of which was to revoke a prior will, was put in issue by the appellant filing a caveat alleging that the deceased was at the time of her death and at the time of making the will without testamentary capacity or, in the alternative, that she was procured to make her last will by undue influence. By the judgment of the Surrogate Court it was found that the will was duly executed, that the testatrix had testamentary capacity and the allegation of undue influence was dismissed. An appeal from that judgment was dismissed by the Court of Appeal. On the appeal to this Court, the appellant\u2019s main contention was that in dismissing the allegation of undue influence on the ground that the caveator had not discharged the burden of proving it, the trial judge failed to give due consideration to the heavy burden resting on the proponents of the will to prove affirmatively the righteousness of the transaction having regard to the fact that the executor R was instrumental in the preparation and execution of the will of a woman over 90 and that he was one of the executors of that will while his wife, who was herself over 80 years of age, was the sole beneficiary.\nHeld (Judson J dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Cartwright, Martland, Ritchie and Spence: There was ample evidence to support the trial judge\u2019s finding of fact, confirmed by the Court of Appeal, that the testatrix had testamentary capacity. Such finding should not be disturbed.\nThe finding of the Courts below that the burden of proving that there was undue influence had not been discharged was valid. But there was a distinction between producing sufficient evidence to satisfy the Court that a suspicion raised by the circumstances surrounding the execution of the will had been dispelled and producing the evidence necessary to establish an allegation of undue influence. The former task lay upon the proponents of the will, the latter was a burden assumed by those who attacked the will.\nThe evidence supported the finding that this will was the free act of a competent testatrix and having regard to the fact that there were con- current findings of two Courts to the effect that there was no \u201cundue influence\u201d which were based on a careful and accurate review of the evidence called for the attacker as well as for the proponents of the will, there was no room for the suggestion that the Court was not \u201cvigilant and jealous\u201d in examining the evidence so as to satisfy itself that any suspicion to which the circumstances might give rise was dispelled.\nBarry v. Butlin (1838), 2 Moo. P.C.C. 480; Fulton v. Andrew (1875), L.R. 7 H.L. 448; Riach v. Ferris, [1934] S.C.R. 725; Tyrrell v. Painton, [1894] P. 151; Leger et al v. Poirier, [1944] S.C.R. 152; Craig v. Lamoureux, [1920] A.C. 349; Wintle v. Nye, [1959] 1 All E.R. 552; Paske v. Ollat (1815), 2 Phillim. 323, referred to.\nPer Judson J., dissenting: The conclusion of the Surrogate Court Judge and the evidence on which it was based did not indicate anything more than that the testatrix was able to understand questions put to her as to ordinary and usual matters. There was no basis for any finding that she had testamentary capacity in the sense ascribed in Leger et al. v. Poirier, supra.\nThe suspicion concerning this will as a valid testamentary document permeated the whole case and could not be removed by a judicial preference for the evidence given by group A witnesses as against that of group B.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Fingland J. Appeal dismissed, Judson J. dissenting.\nW.B. Williston, Q.C., and J. Sopinka, for the appellant.\nJ.D. Arnup, Q.C., for the respondent.\nD.S. Murphy, for D.S. Ryan, surviving executor.\nThe judgment of Cartwright, Martland, Ritchie and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissing an appeal from a judgment of the Surrogate Judge for the County of Huron whereby that judge had ordered that the last will of the late Catherine Agnes Martin was duly executed, that the testatrix possessed testamentary capacity and that an allegation of undue influence made by the present appellant, Dr. MacGregor, the nephew of the testatrix, was to be dismissed.\nThe validity of the will in question was put in issue by Dr. MacGregor filing a caveat alleging that \u201cthe deceased was at the time of her death and at the time of making the will dated on or about the 13th of January 1961 without testamentary capacity or, in the alternative, the said Stewart Alan MacGregor has reason to fear and does fear that the said Catherine Agnes Martin was procured to make her last will and testament dated on or about the 13th of January 1961 by undue influence\u201d.\nBy order of the acting Surrogate Judge, it was directed that the following were the issues to be tried:\n1. David Stewart Ryan and Maud Ryan affirm and Stewart MacGregor denies that the will was duly executed by Catherine Agnes Martin;\n2. David Stewart Ryan and Maud Ryan affirm and Stewart MacGregor denies that Catherine Agnes Martin possessed testamentary capacity;\n3. Stewart MacGregor affirms and David Stewart Ryan and Maud Ryan deny that the making of the will was procured by undue influence.\nThe findings of the learned trial judge as to execution, testamentary capacity and undue influence are findings of fact based on a careful review of the evidence and a firm assessment as to the credibility of all the important witnesses. These findings were affirmed by the Court of Appeal and I am not prepared to reverse them or to substitute my assessment for that of the trial judge as to the character, motives, ability and integrity of the various witnesses who appeared before him.\nI did not understand counsel for the appellant to question the fact that the will was duly executed, nor did I understand him to take direct issue with the finding as to the testatrix\u2019 capacity. His main contention as I understood it was that in dismissing the allegation of undue influence on the ground that the caveator had not discharged the burden of proving it, the learned trial judge failed to give due consideration to the heavy burden resting on the proponents of the will to prove affirmatively the righteousness of the transaction having regard to the fact that Mr. Ryan was instrumental in the preparation and execution of the will of a woman over 90 and that he was one of the executors of that will while his wife, who was herself over 80 years of age, was the sole beneficiary.\nThe principle which is here invoked on behalf of the appellant is most frequently referred to in the language in which it was stated by Baron Parke in Barry v. Butlin[1], where his Lordship formulated the following rules:\n(1) The onus probandi lies in every case upon the party propounding a will; and he must satisfy the conscience of the court that the instrument so propounded is the last will of a free and capable testator, and\n(2) If a party writes or prepares a will, under which he takes a benefit, that is a circumstance that ought generally to excite the suspicion of the court, and calls upon it to be vigilant and jealous in examining the evidence in support of the instrument, in favour of which it ought not to pronounce unless the suspicion is removed, and it is judicially satisfied that the paper propounded does express the true will of the deceased.\nThe second of these rules was stated with added force by Lord Hatherley in Fulton v. Andrew[2], where he referred to the nature of the onus lying upon the proponents of a will under such circumstances in the following terms:\nBut there is a farther onus upon those who take for their own benefit, after having been instrumental in preparing or obtaining a will. They have thrown on them the onus of shewing the righteousness of the transaction.\nThe same rule has been restated in a number of cases, most of which are referred to in the judgment of Crocket J. in Riach v. Ferris[3], in which case Sir Lyman Duff expressly adopted and approved the principle as stated by Davey L.J. in Tyrrell v. Painton[4], where it is stated in this form:\n\u2026the principle is, that wherever a will is prepared under circumstances which raise a well-grounded suspicion that it does not express the mind of the testator, the Court ought not to pronounce in favour of it unless the suspicion is removed.\nIf a will has been shown to have been duly executed after having been read over to or by a testator who appears to understand it, then it will generally be presumed that he had testamentary capacity at the time of its execution but if, in the course of proving the will, it becomes apparent that there are circumstances raising a well-grounded suspicion as to whether the document indeed expresses the true will of the deceased, then a heavy burden lies on the Court to look beyond the presumption created by compliance with these formalities and be satisfied that the will was the free act of a testator who at the time had a \u201cdisposing mind and memory\u201d in the sense defined by Rand J. in Leger et al. v. Poirier[5], where he said: A \u2018disposing mind and memory\u2019 is one able to comprehend, of its own initiative and volition, the essential elements of will-making, property, objects, just claims to consideration, revocation of existing dispositions, and the like;\u2026\nAt the time when the present will was executed the testatrix, who was then 91, had been in the hospital for sixteen days suffering from a combination of infirmities common to a person of her advanced years. She was however, according to the evidence of the nurses, which was believed by the trial judge, alert in her mind, tidy in her habits, determined in whatever course of action she wished to take and quite aware of what she was doing.\nIn 1948 Miss Martin and her sister Maud started to live together but in 1951, when she was 78 years of age, Maud married a Mr. David Ryan with whom she later purchased a house in Seaforth where the testatrix came to live in 1953. On the afternoon of January 13, 1961, David Ryan came to visit the testatrix in hospital and upon his arrival her first remark to him appears to have been:\nI want to change my will and I want to leave everything to Maud and I want you to take care of things for me.\nto which Mr. Ryan is said to have replied that he would look after it and that he would get Mr. Sillery for her. Mr. Sillery is a local lawyer who was well known to the testatrix and it is clear that Mr. Ryan went directly from the hospital to Mr. Sillery\u2019s office where he said:\nCatherine wants you to go up to the hospital and see you sometime. She wants to make out a new will. She said she wanted to be cremated and she wants to leave it all to her sister Maud Ryan.\nand he also said she:\n\u2026wants Maud and I to be executors.\nMr. Sillery at once procured a will form and had a will typed by his wife which incorporated these instructions. Taking the will with them, Mr. Sillery and Mr. Ryan then went back to the hospital. It is perhaps well to point out that the somewhat undue haste in carrying out the testatrix\u2019 instructions is attributable to Mr. Sillery and not to Mr. Ryan. In the course of his evidence Mr. Sillery was asked concerning the drawing and execution of the will:\nQ. Why did you do this immediately, when she used the words she wanted to see you one of these days\u2014Any reason why you did it right then?\nA. I never like to see anything such as instructions to draw a Will from a hospital not carried out as efficiently and effectively as possible. In his evidence Mr. Sillery describes the conversation which he then had with the testatrix as follows:\nQ. In any event, when you did arrive, who spoke first?\nA. I said to Miss Martin \u2018I understood you want to do some business with me.\u2019 So I said \u2018How are you feeling?\u2019 And she said, pointing to her head, \u2018All right up here.\u2019 Then down to her abdomen, \u2018but not down here.\u2019\nQ. You said \u2018How are you feeling?\u2019 She said \u2018All right up here, but not down here?\u2019\nA. That\u2019s right.\nQ. What is the next conversation?\nA. She said \u2018I want to change my Will.\u2019 I said \u2018Mr. Ryan gave me the instructions, so I prepared one.\u2019 She said \u2018I have changed my mind about that cremation; strike that one out.\u2019\nQ. You said you had prepared one. Did you read it or show it to her?\nA. I put it right in front of her, and then read it to her.\nQ. You read it to her, and you said you put it right in front of her and then read it to her. Did she have an opportunity or did she to your notice also read the will?\nA. Yes, sir.\nJUDGE FINGLAND: But more especially, did she read it or did she have the opportunity to read it?\nA. I presume she would read it as I was going along, because she got to the cremation clause and she said she changed her mind about that, cancel that, strike that out.\nTO MR. MURPHY: Q. You don\u2019t know for sure then whether she actually read the Will?\nA. No, no.\nQ. When you read it to her, where was the Will in relation to where she was?\nA. Immediately in front of her on the bed.\nQ. In other words, while you were reading, did she have the opportunity to read it with you?\nA. Yes, she even asked to have the light turned on.\nJUDGE FINGLAND: She asked the nurse to have the light turned on?\nA. Yes.\nTO MR. MURPHY: Q. In any event, you finished reading it. I think you said she wanted something changed?\nA. She said that she was leaving Sandy out of the Will.\nQ. You said she said \u2018I have changed my mind about this cremation?\nA. Yes.\nQ. I show you the Will. There is apparently a line struck out on Page 1, paragraph 1. Can you tell me what paragraph 1 said before the alteration?\nA. It starts out the figure 1 and a period. \u2018I direct that my body shall be cremated.\u2019 There\u2019s a name written over it \u2018Catherine\u2019.\nQ. When was this change made in relation to when the Will was signed, before or after?\nA. Prior to the signing of the Will. Mr. Sillery says that Ryan, who was present throughout this conversation and the execution of the will took no part in either.\nWhen the will had been executed it was duly witnessed by Mr. Sillery and the nurse in attendance, both of whom initialled the change which the testatrix had made. The effect of this will was to revoke a prior will of May 21, 1951, by the terms of which the residue of the estate was given to the Toronto General Trust Corporation as sole executor and trustee upon trust to pay the income to the sister Maud during her lifetime with power to encroach on the capital for her care and maintenance whenever requested to do so by her and provided the trustees considered it necessary and desirable and on the sister\u2019s death to transfer and make over the whole of the residue of the estate to Dr. Stewart A. MacGregor. Dr. MacGregor was a nephew of the testatrix to the cost of whose education she had contributed and to whom she always referred as Sandy. By January 1961 Dr. MacGregor was a successful dentist and, agreeing as I do with the learned trial judge in accepting the evidence of Mr. Sillery, I am satisfied that Miss Martin was fully aware of the fact that the effect of the will in question was \u201cto cut Sandy out\u201d and to leave her estate absolutely to Maud because \u201cshe had lived with her\u201d. This appears to me to be made doubly clear in the following excerpt from Mr. Sillery\u2019s cross-examination:\nQ. And what was said about Dr\u2014\nA. \u2018I\u2019m going to cut Sandy\u2014\u2019She always called him Sandy\u2014\u2019I\u2019m going to cut Sandy out of this Will.\u2019\nQ. Dr. MacGregor or Sandy that you are referring to, he\u2019s the Caveator in these proceedings?\nA. Yes, I presume so.\nQ. Did she give any reason for cutting Dr. MacGregor out?\nA. No, she said she was going to leave it to her only sister.\nQ. That is the only reason she gave?\nA. That\u2019s the only reason\u2014\u2019I have lived with her.\u2019\nMr. Sillery does not appear to have asked the testatrix anything about the extent of her estate or the members of her family for whom she might wish to provide, nor did he give her any advice respecting succession duties, but he does testify to having had the following conversation respecting the revocation of her former will: Q. So then after the Will was signed was there any further conversation with Miss Martin?\nA. Yes. She did say \u2018I have another Will in the Toronto General Trust.\u2019\nQ. She said she had another will in the Toronto General Trust?\nA. \u2018I want to get that.\u2019 And I advised her there was a revocation clause in the Will which would revoke the previous Will.\nIt was contended on behalf of the appellant that the instructions which David Ryan gave to Mr. Sillery concerning cremation indicated that Mr. Ryan had discussed the making of a new will and its terms with Miss Martin before coming to the hospital on January 13 as there is no evidence of that matter having been discussed between them in the hospital. This was cited in support of the contention that the will was the product of Ryan\u2019s advice and influence, but I do not think that it supports any such inference as Miss Martin had apparently discussed the question of cremation informally with others, notably Mr. Sillery, at\u201d an earlier date.\nIt is apparent from the evidence of Anny Coyne, who was a witness to the will, that the testatrix had perfectly rational thoughts on the subject of cremation and valid reasons for deciding not to be cremated. In this regard Miss Coyne\u2019s evidence is as follows:\nQ. Now you have already described to us what occurred while the Will was being signed. What is your opinion as to whether Miss Martin knew what she was doing when she signed that Will? You were there. What was your impression?\nA. I\u2019d say yes, she knew what she was doing. She knew what she wanted to do and she was doing it\u2026\nQ. Would you have witnessed this Will if you had any doubt about that?\nA. No.\nQ. Now after Mr. Sillery and Mr. Ryan left did you have any conversation with Miss Martin?\nA. Yes.\nQ. What did you discuss?\nA. Immediately after, she brought up the subject of cremation and anointing.\nQ. What did she say about cremation?\nA. She said if she was in Montreal she would be cremated. As I took it, she would request that she be cremated. But as she was living away far and it wasn\u2019t readily available that she wasn\u2019t just going to bother about it.\nIt was contended also that the fact that the family doctor had prepared a certificate dated January 13, which he later repudiated, to the effect that he had found the testatrix that day to be in sound mind and aware of her own affairs, was a highly suspicious circumstance because the certificate was in fact not made out until January 17 and the doctor had made no such examination on the 13th of that month. It is true that such a certificate was requested by Mr. Ryan but he was no party to it being falsely dated and it is clear that it was sought by him at the suggestion of Mr. Sillery. The trial judge expressly rejected this doctor\u2019s evidence saying \u201cI place no credibility on the doctor\u2019s testimony\u201d.\nThe question of whether or not the testatrix had a \u201cdisposing mind and memory\u201d is a question of fact and the issue as to testamentary capacity stated in the order of the acting Surrogate Judge places the burden of proof in this regard on the executors. This question has been decided in the affirmative by the learned trial judge and has been confirmed by the Court of Appeal and the rule established in this Court by a long series of cases is that such a concurrent finding should not be disturbed unless it cannot be supported by the evidence. In my view there is ample evidence upon which to base this finding.\nAs to the question of whether the execution of this will was the \u201cfree act\u201d of the testatrix, the learned trial judge and the Court of Appeal have both found that there was no undue influence. This is also a question of fact the burden of proving which rested on the caveator. I am equally satisfied as to the validity of the finding that this burden has not been discharged, but as I have stated, what is put forward by appellant\u2019s counsel is that even if this be so, the conclusion of the trial judge is still open to objection on the ground that he misdirected himself and failed to take into account the burden resting on the proponents of the will to dispel the suspicion created by the fact that Mr. Ryan was instrumental in obtaining it.\nThere is a distinction to be borne in mind between producing sufficient evidence to satisfy the Court that a suspicion raised by the circumstances surrounding the execution of the will have been dispelled and producing the evidence necessary to establish an allegation of undue influence. The former task lies upon the proponents of the will, the latter is a burden assumed by those who are attacking the will and can only be discharged by proof of the existence of an influence acting upon the mind of the testator of the kind described by Viscount Haldane in Craig v. Lamoureux[6], at p. 357 where he says:\nUndue influence, in order to render a will void, must be an influence which can justly be described by a person looking at the matter judicially to have caused the execution of a paper pretending to express a testator\u2019s mind, but which really does not express his mind, but something else which he did not really mean.\nThe distinction to which I have referred is well described by Crocket J. in Riach v. Ferris, supra, at p. 736 where he says:\nAssuming that in the case in behalf of a plaintiff seeking to establish the validity of a will, there may be such circumstances of apparent coercion or fraud disclosed as, coupled with the testator\u2019s physical and mental debility, raise a well-grounded suspicion in the mind of the court that the testator did not really comprehend what he was doing when he executed the will, and that in such a case it is for the plaintiff to remove that suspicion by affirmatively proving that the testator did in truth appreciate the effect of what he was doing, there is no question that, once this latter fact is proved, the onus entirely lies upon those impugning the will to affirmatively prove that its execution was procured by the practice of some undue influence or fraud upon the testator.\nIn the case of Barry v. Butlin, supra, and in most of the cases which have followed it, including the case of Wintle v. Nye[7], upon which much reliance was placed by the appellant, the circumstances giving rise to suspicion were that a person who benefited under the will in question had actually prepared the document, but it is apparent from the decision in Tyrrell v. Painton, supra, that any well-grounded suspicion is sufficient to put the Court on its guard to scrutinize the circumstances so as to ensure that it has been put at rest before deciding in favour of the will.\nCounsel for the appellant contended that in all cases where the circumstances surrounding the preparation or execution of the will give rise to a suspicion, the burden lying on the proponents of that will to show that it was the testator\u2019s free act is an unusually heavy one, but it would be a mistake, in my view, to treat all such cases as if they called for the meeting of some standard of proof of a more than ordinarily onerous character. The extent of the proof required is proportionate to the gravity of the suspicion and the degree of suspicion varies with the circumstances of each case. It is true that there are expressions in some of the judgments to which I have referred which are capable of being construed as meaning that a particularly heavy burden lies upon the proponents in all such cases, but in my view nothing which has been said should be taken to have established the requirements of a higher degree of proof than that referred to by Sir John Nicholl in Paske v. Ollat[8], where he said at p. 324:\n\u2026the law of England requires, in all instances of the sort, that the proof should be clear and decisive;\u2014the balance must not be left in equilibrio; the proof must go not merely to the act of signing, but to the knowledege of the contents of the paper. In ordinary cases this is not necessary; but where the person who prepares the instrument, and conducts the execution of it, is himself an interested person, his conduct must be watched as that of an interested person;\u2014propriety and delicacy would infer that he should not conduct the transaction;\u2026\nThe italics are my own.\nThis is not a case in which the will was prepared by a beneficiary and it appears from the evidence that the first suggestion as to its preparation was made by the testatrix herself, but the age of the testatrix, the haste with which the instructions were carried out, the absence of Mr. Ryan from the witness stand and the failure of Mr. Sillery to discuss the changes made from the former will or to give any advice concerning them, are circumstances which standing alone might well constitute grounds for a suspicion that \u201cundue influence\u201d had been exercised, and there can be no doubt that Mr. Ryan was an \u201cinterested person\u201d. I am, however, of opinion that the evidence supports the finding that this will was the free act of a competent testatrix and having regard to the fact that there are concurrent findings of two Courts to the effect that there was no \u201cundue influence\u201d which are based on a careful and accurate review of the evidence called for the attacker as well as for the proponents of the will, I am unable to see that there is any room for the suggestion that the Court was not \u201cvigilant and jealous\u201d in examining the evidence so as to satisfy itself that any suspicion to which the circumstances might give rise was dispelled.\nI would accordingly dismiss this appeal and I direct that the costs of the surviving executor as between solicitor and client be paid out of the estate. In view of all the circumstances, I would also direct that the costs of the caveator on a party and party basis be paid from the same fund. JUDSON J. (dissenting):\u2014My opinion is that this will should not have been admitted to probate. The principle on which the Surrogate Court should have acted in this case is not in doubt and is authoritatively stated in a judgment of this Court in Riach v. Ferris[9]. There was failure in that Court to examine the evidence in the light of that case. The Court of Appeal, however, corrected the omission and decided that the burden of establishing testamentary capacity when the circumstances were suspicious had been met, and, further, that there was no evidence of undue influence. Consequently, the judgment of the Surrogate Court was affirmed.\nCounsel for the appellant in this Court did not argue undue influence but confined himself to the one point that an examination of the evidence could not indicate that the suspicion had been removed.\nI take the principle to be applied from the concurring judgment of Duff C.J. in Riach v. Ferris:\nI entirely agree in the conclusions of my brother Crocket as well as in the reasons by which those conclusions are supported. My purpose in adding what I am now saying is merely to note that the law is well established and well known and that, as applicable to this appeal, it is best, as well as completely, stated in this passage from the judgment of Lord Davey (then Davey L.J.) in his judgment in Tyrrell v. Painton (L.R. [1894] P. 151, at 159-160):\n\u201c\u2026the principle is, that wherever a will is prepared under circumstances which raise a well-grounded suspicion that it does not express the mind of the testator, the Court ought not to pronounce in favour of it unless that suspicion is removed.\u201d\nI do not think that the conclusion of the Surrogate Court Judge and the evidence on which it was based indicates anything more than this, that the testatrix was able to understand questions put to her as to ordinary and usual matters. To me there is no basis for any finding that she had testamentary capacity in the sense ascribed in Leger et al. v. Poirier[10]:\nBut there is no doubt whatever that we may have testamentary incapacity accompanied by a deceptive ability to answer questions of ordinary and usual matters: that is, the mind may be incapable of carrying apprehension beyond a limited range of familiar and suggested topics. A \u201cdisposing mind and memory\u201d is one able to comprehend, of its own initiative and volition, the essential elements of will-making, property, objects, just claims to consideration, revocation of existing dispositions, and the like; this has been recognized in many cases.\n* * * Merely to be able to make rational responses is not enough, nor to repeat a tutored formula of simple terms. There must be a power to hold the essential field of the mind in some degree of appreciation as a whole, and this I am satisfied was not present here.\nI turn now to a consideration of the suspicious circumstances on which the appellant relies for the invalidation of this will. The testatrix, Catherine Martin, was born on February 2, 1870. She made this will on January 13, 1961, when she was in hospital during her last illness. She died on February 4, 1961. The will came into being as a result of instructions given by her to her brother-in-law, David Ryan. According to Mr. Ryan\u2019s report to a solicitor, she wanted to leave the whole estate to her sister Maud, who was Ryan\u2019s wife. Ryan himself did not give evidence. We have Ryan\u2019s instructions only through the mouth of the solicitor. The solicitor prepared the will immediately without first consulting Miss Martin. He then took it to the hospital, accompanied by Ryan, and had it executed. He then delivered the will to Ryan. Ryan then obtained a false certificate from the doctor who was in attendance on Miss Martin to the effect that she knew what she was doing. This certificate was dated January 13, 1961, the date of the execution of the will. It was, in fact, signed four days later, on January 17. It is in these terms:\nJan. 13\/61\nTo Whom it may Concern:\nThis is to certify that I have this day examined Miss Catherine A. Martin and find her to be in sound mind and aware of her own affairs.\nThe testatrix, her sister Maud and her sister\u2019s husband had been living together in Seaforth since the year 1953. David Ryan was a second husband of Maud Ryan. They were married in 1951. Maud Ryan did not survive her sister very long. She died on December 10, 1963, in her eighties. Her husband was, at the date of the trial, also in his eighties.\nThere is nothing in any of the evidence to explain a sudden, precipitate revocation of a previous will which had been twice confirmed by the testatrix when she was undoubtedly of sound mind. This will had been executed in 1951 and left to the sister a life interest with power to the trustees to encroach on capital in case of need. It was a rational will and made adequate provision for the sister. If in 1951 she had decided to leave everything to the sister absolutely, there could have been no issue. I recognize that; the sister was a natural object of the bounty of the testatrix, perhaps more so than Dr. MacGregor. However, in 1951, Dr. MacGregor had been left the residue after the life interest of the sister and after any necessary encroachment. We do not know why, three weeks before her death, the testatrix changed her mind and departed from these well-thought-out plans for her sister.\nThe circumstances in which the will was prepared and executed give rise to suspicion. The solicitor took his instructions from an intermediary. He immediately prepared a will according to these instructions and took it for execution. He made no effort to ascertain by independent inquiry from the testatrix what her instructions were. The extent of these instructions depends entirely on what Ryan told the solicitor. This solicitor cannot be regarded as an independent adviser chosen by the testatrix. Ryan was in the room when the will was executed. The solicitor did no more than read over the will to her and made the change when she said that she had decided against being cremated. If the solicitor decided to draw the will on Ryan\u2019s instructions, he should have interviewed Miss Martin in the absence of Ryan. He should have made some independent attempt to ascertain testamentary capacity, her reasons for the change, her knowledge and appreciation of the extent of her property, and of her former will, and why she was cutting out Dr. MacGregor, if he knew that. What a prudent, careful and competent solicitor would do in circumstances such as these is fully discussed in what I regard as the leading case in Ontario on this subject, Murphy v. Lamphier[11].\nThe obtaining of the medical certificate is significant. It was falsely dated. The doctor said that he gave it to Ryan, who was also his patient, because he did not wish to upset him. Later, when there was a prospect of litigation, he told Ryan that the certificate was in error and that he would not stand behind it. The doctor\u2019s evidence at the trial was that the testatrix was often confused, that she could not answer questions correctly and was mixed up as to day and night. The irresistible conclusion from his evidence, if it is to be accepted, is that the testatrix was not in complete possession of her faculties and that there was grave doubt about her mental capacity. The learned trial judge chose to disregard this evidence in its entirety, but the fact remains that he was the one best qualified to know. He was correcting his error and, in my opinion, it was no solution to the difficult problem before the learned trial judge to disregard entirely the only professional evidence on the subject.\nThere was other evidence confirming the doctor\u2019s evidence, as well as evidence against it. The evidence against it is that of two private nurses, the hospital superintendent and a minister who thought that the testatrix knew what she was doing. I do not know that any of this evidence touches on testamentary capacity. A night nurse thought that the testatrix was confused and talked irrationally. On January 14, the day after the will-making, the appellant and his wife visited the testatrix when they found her lying with her mouth open, staring at the ceiling, making a gurgling noise, unable to recognize them and unable to conduct any conversation. Another witness, who became a fellow patient in the same room with the testatrix on January 14, said that this was the condition in which she found the testatrix during her stay in the hospital.\nFinally, it was of the utmost significance in this case that Ryan did not give evidence. We know nothing of his instructions beyond what he repeated to the solicitor and what the solicitor reported back to the testatrix. Ryan\u2019s evidence was absolutely essential to any proper appreciation of what had gone on between him and the testatrix leading up to the making of this will. It is true that he was an old man at the time of the trial, a year or two older than he was when the will was made, but he was in Court on the opening of the trial. He was present when some of the evidence was given. He was a surviving executor of the will and yet he did not give evidence. How can it be said in those circumstances that the suspicion concerning this will as a valid testamentary document has been removed? The suspicion permeates the whole case and cannot be removed by a judicial prefer- ence for the evidence given by group A witnesses as against that of group B.\nI would allow the appeal and dismiss the application for probate made in the Surrogate Court of the County of Huron. The appellant should have his costs throughout. I would make no order for costs in favour of the executors of the will offered for probate.\nAppeal dismissed, JUDSON J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Fasken, Calvin, Mackenzie, Williston & Swackhamer, Toronto,\nSolicitors for the respondent, D.S.

It was also provided that the receipt of the moneys by the Jewish National Fund from the Royal Trust Co. (the executor and trustee under the will) was to release them from any further responsibility.\nOn a motion for construction of the will, the Court held that this was a valid charitable disposition. The Court of Appeal was unanimously of the opposite opinion. The Jewish National Fund appealed to this Court and sought to have the judgment of the judge of first instance restored. The respondents were the next-of-kin of the testator and were interested in an intestacy.\nIn this Court the appellant, for the first time, took the position (i) that in the law of British Columbia the rule against perpetuities is one based on considerations of internal policy and does not apply to invalidate a trust of movables created by a testator domiciled in British Columbia if the trust is to be administered outside that province, (ii) that the trust created by the residuary clause was to be administered in the State of New York, (iii) that the question before the Court should be determined according to the law of that state, and (iv) that by that law the trust was charitable and valid.\nHeld (Judson and Spence JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Cartwright, Martland and Ritchie JJ.: Prima facie the applicable law was that of British Columbia, the general rule being that the essential validity of a gift of movables is to be determined by the law of the testator's domicile. If the applicable law was that of British Columbia the bequest was invalid. The residuary clause did not require the trustees to devote the fund or its proceeds to purposes which were charitable in law and the trust was void as offending the rule against perpetuities. Unless the contrary was alleged and proved the presumption was that the law of all the other countries in which the trustees might decide to purchase was the same as that of British Columbia. A trust of movables void under the law of the testator's domicile and under that of many other countries in which the trustees were authorized to carry it out could not be rendered valid by the circumstance that the trustees were permitted, but not required, to carry it out in a country in which it would be regarded as valid.\nIn the circumstances of this case the place of administration would be the country in which the lands were purchased and managed; the place of residence of the trustees was irrelevant. To hold that the validity of a trust of personalty to be laid out in the purchase of land created by the will of a testator should be determined not by the law of his domicile or by the law of the situs of the land directed to be purchased (or perhaps by application of both) but by the law of the residence or the domicile of the trustee appointed to make the purchase would be contrary to authority and productive of uncertainty and inconvenience in the administration of estates.\nFordyce v. Bridges (1848), 2 Ph. 497; Re Mitchner; Union Trustee Co. of Australia v. The Attorney-General for Australia (No. 2), [1922] St. R. Qd. 252; Dunne v. Byrne, [1912] A.C. 407, applied.\nPer Judson and Spence JJ., dissenting: If a gift was valid by the perpetuities law of the place of administration but invalid by the perpetuities law of the testator's domicile, the governing law should be that of the place of administration. In the case at bar, the British Columbia executorship had ended. The residue was to be turned over to New York trustees upon clearly defined trusts which were recognized as valid by the law of that state. At that moment it became a New York trust to be administered there according to the law of the state. What difficulties of administration, if any, might be encountered outside the boundaries of that state were of no further concern to the Court of the domicile. The testator had directed the delivery of the residue to trustees in a foreign jurisdiction where the trust was valid. The administration of the trust from then on was controlled by the laws of a jurisdiction which recognized its validity. Accordingly, the appeal should be allowed.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] , allowing an appeal from a judgment of Wootton J. on a motion for construction of a will. Appeal dismissed, Judson and Spence JJ. dissenting.\nJ.J. Robinette, Q.C., and L. F. Lindholm, for the appellant.\nD. G. Cameron, for the respondent, Royal Trust Company.\nD. M. Gordon, Q.C., and J. C. Cowan, for the respondents, Clara Richter et al.\nThe judgment of Cartwright, Martland and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a unanimous decision of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[2][3] allowing an appeal from a judgment of Wootton J. and declaring that the residuary bequest to the appellant contained in the will of the late Frank Schechter is invalid and that his executor holds the property comprised in that bequest in trust for the next-of-kin of the testator.\nFrank Schechter, hereinafter referred to as \"the testator\", died in Victoria, British Columbia, on May 2, 1961, domiciled in British Columbia. He was unmarried. He left a will dated September 17, 1932, probate of which was granted to the Royal Trust Company, the executor named in the will, on October 13,1961.\nThe scheme of the will is simple. The testator appoints his executor, gives directions as to his funeral, gives legacies to two charities, gives seven legacies to relatives and then disposes of the residue of his estate in the following words:\nI give and devise and bequeath all the residue of my real and personal estate unto my Trustees upon trust, to sell, call in and convert the same into money, and subject to the payments of my debts, funeral and testamentary expenses, legacies and any duties payable on any legacies bequeathed or any real property devised by me herein, as to both capital and income to pay the same to the Jewish National Fund (Keren Kayemeth Le-Israel) Inc., III Fifth Avenue, New York, U.S.A. to be used by the trustees of the said Jewish National Fund as a continuing and separate trust apart from all other funds, for the purchase of a tract or tracts of the best lands obtainable, in Palestine, the United States of America or any British Dominion, and the establishment thereon of a Jewish colony or colonies, to be known as the Frank Schechter Colony or Colonies, the land to be rented on such terms as may be decided on by the Jewish National Fund, the proceeds of the said rentals to be used for the purchase of further lands on the basis outlined above, and that the receipt of such monies by the said Jewish National Fund to the Royal Trust Company, to release them from any responsibility of the said monies.\nThe net value of the estate after payment of debts was $351,153.53 of which $9,250 was realty and the balance personalty. The total of the pecuniary legacies mentioned above was $14,300.\nThe validity of the residuary bequest having been questioned by some of the next-of-kin, the executor applied to the Court by way of originating notice to have the matter determined.\nIn the Courts below it was the contention of the next-of-kin that the residuary clause was void for uncertainty and alternatively that it created a perpetual trust which was not charitable and therefore void. For the appellant it was argued that the residuary bequest constituted an absolute gift to it and alternatively that it was not void for uncertainty and created a good charitable trust.\nAfter stating these submissions, Lett C.J.B.C. continued as follows:\nThere was no suggestion in argument that the construction of the will is governed by any law other than that of British Columbia, since the testator was domiciled in this province prior to and at the time of his death. No argument was advanced on any question relating to the conflict of laws.\nIn this Court, in addition to the grounds on which it had relied below, the appellant, for the first time, took the position (i) that in the law of British Columbia the rule against perpetuities is one based on considerations of internal policy and does not apply to invalidate a trust of movables created by a testator domiciled in British Coumbia if the trust is to be administered outside that province, (ii) that the trust created by the residuary clause is to be administered in the State of New York, (iii) that the question before us should be determined according to the law of that state, and (iv) that by that law the trust is charitable and valid.\nIn my opinion, the argument that there was an absolute gift to the appellant cannot be supported; it was rejected by each of the members of the Court of Appeal and there is nothing that I can usefully add to their reasons on this point.\nIf the question is to be determined in accordance with the law of British Columbia I agree with the conclusion of the Court of Appeal that the residuary clause does not require the trustees to devote the fund or its proceeds to purposes which are charitable in law and that the trust is void as offending the rule against perpetuities. On this branch of the matter I am content to adopt the reasons of Davey J. A.\nTurning now to the appellant's argument summarized above which was advanced for the first time in this Court it would seem that prima facie the applicable law is that of British Columbia. The general rule is stated in Dicey's Conflict of Laws, 7th ed. at p. 609 as follows:\nThe material or essential validity of a will of movables or of any particular gift of movables contained therein is governed by the law of the testator's domicile at the time of his death.\nIn commenting on this rule the learned author says at pp. 610 and 611:\nIt is well settled that the material or essential validity of a will of movables or of any particular gift of movables contained therein is governed by the law of the testator's domicile at the date of his death. That law determines such questions as whether the testator is bound to leave a certain proportion of his estate to his wife and children, whether legacies to charities are valid, to what extent gifts are invalid as infringing the rule against perpetuities or accumulations, whether substitutionary gifts are valid, whether gifts to attesting witnesses are valid, and so on.\nIf the will bequeaths movables on trusts which are void for remoteness under the rule against perpetuities in force in the country of the testator's last domicile, but the movables are situated and the trust is to be administered in another country by the law of which it is valid, it has been suggested that the law of the place of administration should govern and that the trust should be valid. There is some British authority which supports this suggestion, and it seems reasonable in principle. In the United States the trust appears to be valid if it complies with the rule against perpetuities in force in either the place of administration or the testator's last domicile. The same principle should no doubt be applied to the question whether gifts to charities are valid.\nIn Morris and Leach, The Rule Against Perpetuities, 2nd ed., at pp. 22 and 23, the effect of the American authorities is stated to be that a gift of movables which infringes the rule against perpetuities in force in the country of the testator's domicile does not fail if it is valid under the law of the place of administration and a gift which infringes the perpetuities law of the place of administration does not fail if it is valid under the law of the testator's domicile. This statement is followed by the following comment at p. 23:\nThis may be an acceptable result if the two laws agree in general policy and differ only in detail. It might well not be acceptable to an English court if a testator domiciled in some country where there is no Rule against Perpetuities attempted to create a trust of English property, to be administered in England, which infringed the Rule.\nIn Cheshire, Private International Law, 6th ed. the matter is considered at pp. 573 to 577. The learned author says at p. 575:\nIt should not be assumed that because a testator dies domiciled in England his will is therefore inevitably subject to all the rules of English domestic law concerned with essential validity. This fact has not always been admitted. It has been said, for instance, that whether a restraint upon marriage or a gift for masses, or a gift to a charity is valid, or whether a limitation is void as infringing the rule against perpetuities, must be determined by the lex domicilii of the testator no matter what the domicile of the beneficiary may be. It is submitted that this view is neither consonant with principle nor warranted by the authorities. It entirely ignores the essential difference between the right to give and the right to receive. The two are not necessarily in pari materia. The right of a testator to give, as for example whether he is free to bequeath the whole of his property as it pleases him or on the contrary whether he must reserve a legitimate portion for his children, is ex necessitate governed by the English lex successionis from which his testamentary power of disposition is derived. But there is no reason why this law should restrict the right of a foreign legatee to enjoy a gift in accordance with the terms of the will, provided that the legacy is valid according to his personal law and provided that the limitations imposed upon its enjoyment do not offend some rule of public policy so sacred in English eyes as to demand extra-territorial application.\nand at pp. 576 and 577:\nSuppose that a testator, domiciled in England, leaves a sum of money in trust that the income thereof shall be used for purposes most conducive to the good of religion in a certain diocese in country X, and that persons domiciled in X are appointed to administer the trust. The trust is invalid by English law as not being charitable, but, if it is valid by the law of X, must the court forbid payment of the money to the trustees? Such a ruling would be indefensible. English law confines the definition of a charity within comparatively narrow limits, presumably with the object of restricting the amount of money that may be withdrawn from circulation, but it cannot justifiably claim to impose this policy upon foreign countries. The decisive factor is the law of the country where the trust is to be administered, not the law that governs the instrument of gift. No doubt, three conditions must be satisfied before transfer of the money to the foreign country will be authorized.\nFirstly, the charitable bequest must be valid according to the law of the country where it is to be administered.\nSecondly, there must be persons in that country willing and competent to undertake the task of administration.\nThirdly, the purposes for which the bequest is to be employed must not conflict with some rule of English public policy intended to operate extra-territorially. It can scarcely be maintained that a rule which confines within narrow limits the possible beneficiaries of a charitable gift is intended to be anything more than local in its operation.\nFor the purposes of this appeal I am prepared to assume, without finally deciding, that if the testator had directed that his residuary estate be paid to the appellant to be used by its trustees for the purchase of a tract or tracts of the best land obtainable in the State of New York to be held for the purposes set out in the residuary clause the validity of the clause should be determined by the law of the State of New York, and it would have been necessary to consider whether that law has been sufficiently proved.\nBut this is not what the testator has done. He has given to the trustees the choice of purchasing lands in Palestine, the United States of America or any British Dominion. I have already indicated my agreement with the conclusion of the Court of Appeal that if the applicable law is that of British Columbia the bequest is invalid. Unless the contrary is alleged and proved the presumption is that the law of all the other countries in which the trustees might decide to purchase is the same as that of British Columbia. It seems to me that a trust of movables void under the law of the testator's domicile and under that of many other countries in which the trustees are authorized to carry it out cannot be rendered valid by the circumstance that the trustees are permitted, but not required, to carry it out in a country in which it would be regarded as valid. To hold otherwise would, in my opinion, be an extension of the exception to the general rule, that the essential validity of a gift of movables is to be determined by the law of the testator's domicile, unwarranted by the two cases of Fordyce v. Bridges[4] and Re Mitchner; Union Trustee Co. of Australia v. The Attorney-General for Australia (No. 2)[5] , which were chiefly relied on in support of the appellant's argument. Such an extension does not appear to me to be justified by any decision to which we have been referred. It would be productive of inconvenience and uncertainty and would be inconsistent with the underlying rule that a trust is not a valid charitable trust unless the trustees are obligated, not merely permitted, to devote the trust funds to a purpose which is charitable in law.\nI agree with the submission of counsel for the next-of-kin that in the circumstances of this case \"the place of administration\" of the trust would be the country in which the lands were purchased and managed and that the place of residence of the trustees would be irrelevant. I find nothing in the two cases last referred to which is contrary to this view.\nIn Fordyce v. Bridges, supra, it would seem from the report that the testator was domiciled in England, that the trustees resided there and that the personal estate was situate there. By the will the trustees were given a discretion to invest the personal estate either in the purchase of lands in England on specified limitations which were valid by the law of England or in the purchase of lands in Scotland in a regular Scotch entail the limitations of which were valid by the law of Scotland but would have been void as a perpetuity by the law of England. It was held that the personal estate could be validly invested in the purchase of lands in Scotland. It was the law of the situs of the lands purchased that governed not the law of the residence of the trustees. The will did not give the trustees any power to invest the personal estate in the purchase of lands in England subject to the limitations of a regular Scotch entail, which purchase would have been invalid by the law of England. In the case at bar, the trustees in New York are authorized to purchase lands in British Columbia on trusts invalid by the law of that province.\nIn Re Mitchner, supra, the testator, domiciled in Queensland, directed his executors to pay part of his residuary trust funds to named persons in Germany who were to deal with such funds on certain trusts. The Supreme Court of Queensland held that this direction was void as offending the rule against perpetuities; see Re Mitchner; Union Trustee Co. of Australia v. The Attorney-General of Australia[6] .\nThis decision was varied by the High Court of Australia by a judgment which declared that the gifts did not infringe the law against perpetuities and referred the questions back to the Supreme Court. What occurred at the second hearing in the Supreme Court is summarized in the head-note at p. 253 as follows:\nHeld, that the bequest was a valid bequest according to Queensland law; but that the Court would not pronounce finally on its validity until informed whether it was practical to give effect in Germany to the trusts declared, and whether the law of Germany would allow them to be carried into effect, because if they could not be carried into effect in Germany, the Queensland Court could not administer cy pres, and the bequest would fail.\nIt would appear that the law first applied was that of the testator's domicile which governed subject to ascertaining that the trusts could be lawfully carried out in Germany.\nTo hold that the validity of a trust of personalty to be laid out in the purchase of land created by the will of a testator should be determined not by the law of his domicile or by the law of the situs of the land directed to be purchased (or perhaps by application of both) but by the law of the residence or the domicile of the trustee appointed to make the purchase would, in my opinion, be contrary to authority and productive of uncertainty and inconvenience in the administration of estates. What, it may be asked, would be the result if the trustee at the date of the testator's death resided in a jurisdiction by the laws of which the trust was invalid and a year later moved into a jurisdiction by the laws of which the trust was valid? The difficulty suggested by this question is only one of several which would result from attaching importance to the residence or domicile of the trustee.\nWhile that case was in no way concerned with the geographical location of the trustee or with the conflict of laws, the following words used by Lord Macnaghten in Dunne v. Byrne[7] appear to me to be appropriate:\nIt is difficult to see on what principle a trust expressed in plain language, whether the words used be sufficient or insufficient to satisfy the requirements of the law, can be modified or limited in its scope by reference to the position or character of the trustee\nFor the above reasons I would reject this argument of the appellant, even on the assumption that it has been proved that the trust created by the residuary clause would have been regarded as a valid charitable trust under the law of the State of New York. This renders it unnecessary for me to decide whether the law of New York was sufficiently proved. It also becomes unnecessary for me to consider the argument of the respondents, which found favour with Lett C. J. B. C., that the trust was void for uncertainty and I express no opinion upon it.\nIn the result I would dismiss the appeal but would direct that the costs of all parties in this Court, those of the executor as between solicitor and client, be paid out of the residuary estate of the testator.\nThe judgment of Judson and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nJUDSON J. (dissenting):\u2014The testator left his residuary estate to be used by the trustees of the Jewish National Fund Inc., New York, as a continuing and separate trust for the purchase of the best lands available in Palestine, the United States of America or any British Dominion, and the establishment thereon of a Jewish colony or colonies, the land to be rented on such terms as might be decided on by the Jewish National Fund and the proceeds of the rentals to be used for the purchase of further lands on the basis outlined above. It was also provided that the receipt of the moneys by the Jewish National Fund from the Royal Trust Company (the executor and trustee under the will) was to release them from any further responsibility.\nOn a motion for construction of the will, Wootton J., the judge of first instance, held that this was a valid charitable disposition. The Court of Appeal[8] was unanimously of the opposite opinion. The Jewish National Fund is the appellant in this Court and seeks to have the judgment of Wootton J. restored. The respondents are the next-of-kin of the testator and are interested in an intestacy.\nThe Jewish National Fund is a corporation which was incorporated in 1926 under the laws of the State of New York. Its principal objects are to collect gifts to be devoted to the purchase of land in Palestine for the purpose of promoting and furthering the religious, cultural, physical, social, agricultural and general welfare of Jewish settlers and inhabitants of Palestine now or hereafter residing there, and to aid, encourage and promote the development of Jewish life in Palestine. There is evidence in the record that a gift to this corporation would be recognized as a valid charitable gift under the laws of the State of New York.\nThe agent of the New York Fund in Israel, Keren Kayemeth Le Israel, is recognized as a charitable organization by the State of Israel. On the other hand, the English counterpart of the New York Fund, Keren Kayemeth Le Jisroel, Limited, when it sought exemption from income tax in England, was held not to be \"a body of persons\u2026 established for charitable purposes only\" and, as such, entitled to exemption from income tax[9] .\nI do not think that any valid distinction can be drawn between the objects of the English Fund and the New York Fund. The English Fund was incorporated in 1907 and acquired power to purchase lands in Palestine, Syria and any other parts of Turkey in Asia and the Peninsula of Sinai, for the purpose of settling Jews on these lands. The New York Fund can purchase lands in Palestine, the United States of America, or any British Dominion. Both Funds have many objects ancillary to the main object, and, indeed, the New York Fund until shortly after the death of the testator, confined its activities to acting as a collecting agent for the English Fund. In 1961 it severed its connection with the English Fund and provided for the sending of its moneys direct to Israel. This change of powers came after the death of the testator and nothing decisive can come from the fact that at the date of his death there was some dependent relation of one Fund to the other. Under the terms of this trust, it is the New York Fund that is to administer this residuary gift through its trustees in the manner specified in the will.\nIt is, however, of significance that when the English Fund was litigating with the Inland Revenue Commissioners in 1932, it was held not to be a charitable organization. It was rejected as a trust for religious purposes, as a trust for the relief of poverty and as a trust for other purposes beneficial to the community. The House of Lords was unable to say that there was any identifiable community to be benefited. The British Columbia Court of Appeal adopted this reasoning as the foundation of their judgment. The only function of the Royal Trust Company under this will as executor and trustee is to convert the estate into money and after payment of debts, funeral and testamentary expenses and legacies and duties, to pay the residue to the New York Fund. It has no function in the administration of the trust which the will attempts to set up. The release of the New York Fund for these moneys is a complete release to the Royal Trust Company. Nothing is to be done by the Royal Trust Company in the administration of the trust in British Columbia. The trust sought to be set up here is a foreign trust to be administered in a jurisdiction where, according to the evidence, it is a valid charitable trust. Assuming that in British Columbia the trust is not recognized as charitable and that it is a trust the administration of which may last beyond the perpetuity period, the first question is whether the rule against perpetuities applies to a trust of movables created by a person domiciled in British Columbia if the trust is to be administered outside British Columbia in a jurisdiction which recognizes its validity. It has been said that the object of the perpetuity rule is to restrict the withdrawal of property from channels of commerce, a purpose which is purely local.\nBoth in Cheshire Private International Law, 6th ed., p. 576, and less emphatically in Morris and Leach, The Rule Against Perpetuities, 2nd ed., p. 22, the opinion is expressed that if the gift is valid by the perpetuities law of the place of administration but invalid by the perpetuities law of the place of the testator's domicile, the governing law should be that of the place of administration.\nThe beginning of the authority on which this opinion is founded is in Fordyce v. Bridges[10] . Here an English testator left the residue of his estate to trustees upon trust to convert it into money and lay it out in the purchase of land in England or Scotland according to the limitations of a Scottish entail. A purchase of land in England according to these limitations would offend the rule against perpetuities. On a bill being filed to test the propriety of purchases in Scotland, it was held that the legacy to be expended in Scotland in a manner permissible by Scottish law was valid. The ratio is in the following extract from the judgment of Lord Cottenham: An objection was made that the bequest of a fund to be invested in a regular Scotch entail was void as a perpetuity. The rules acted upon by the Courts in this country with respect to testamentary dispositions tending to perpetuities relate to this country only. What the law of Scotland may be upon such a subject, the Courts of this country have no judicial knowledge, nor will they, I apprehend, inquire: the fund being to be administered in a foreign country is payable here though the purpose to which it is to be applied would have been illegal if the administration of the fund had been to take place in this country. This is exemplified by the well established rule in cases of bequests within the statute of Mortmain. A charity legacy void in this country under the statute of Mortmain is good and payable here if for a charity in Scotland.\nThis case was followed in a Queensland case Re Mitchner; Union Trustee Co. of Australia v. The Attorney General of Australia (No. 2)[11] in which a testator domiciled in Queensland bequeathed movables to trustees resident in Germany to be applied on trusts which infringed the rule against perpetuities in force in Queensland but which were valid by German law. The trusts were held to be valid.\nThere is more authority in the United States beginning with Chamberlain v. Chamberlain[12] , at p. 434, where it is said:\nBut so far as the validity of bequests depends upon the general law and policy of the State affecting property and its acquisition generally, and relating to its accumulation and a suspension of ownership and the power of alienation, each State is sovereign as to all property within its territory, whether real or personal.\nIt is no part of the policy of the State of New York to interdict perpetuities or gifts in mortmain in Pennsylvania or California. Each State determines those matters according to its own views of policy or right, and no other State has any interest in the question; and there is no reason why the courts of this State should follow the funds bequeathed to the Centenary Fund Society to Pennsylvania, to see whether they will be there administered in all respects in strict harmony with our policy and our laws. The question was before the court in Fordyce v. Bridges (2 Phillips, 497), upon the bequest of a fund in England, to be invested in a Scotch entail.\nThis case was followed in the following four cases: Robb v. Washington and Jefferson College[13] ; In re Chappell's Estate[14] ; Amerige v. Attorney General[15] ; In re Grant's Will'[16] .\nTo the same effect is Gray, The Rule Against Perpetuities, 4th ed., p. 288: 263. 3 Influence of Law of Place of Administration. If a legacy is given on a charitable trust which is to be carried out in another jurisdiction where it would be valid, sometimes the law of the domicil forbids such a legacy absolutely, and in that case the legacy is void; but sometimes the law only forbids such trusts within the state of the domicil, and then the legacy is good. And in this latter case it seems that the trust will be subject to the law of the other jurisdiction in matters of administration.\nThe next-of-kin say that the law of the State of New York has nothing to do with the administration of this trust, that the law of the situs of the purchase of land will govern and that the will permits the trust to be administered in a multitude of places and that the trust fails if it would be non-charitable in any of them. I think that the first assertion is erroneous and that the rest falls with it. The British Columbia executorship has ended. The residue is to be turned over to New York trustees upon clearly defined trusts which are recognized as valid by the law of that state. At that moment it becomes a New York trust to be administered there according to the law of the state. What difficulties of administration, if any, may be encountered outside the boundaries of that state are of no further concern to the Court of the domicile. The testator has directed the delivery of the residue to trustees in a foreign jurisdiction where the trust is valid. The administration of the trust from then on is controlled by the laws of a jurisdiction which recognizes its validity.\nI would allow the appeal on this ground alone. However, the reasons delivered in the Court of Appeal indicate that this point was not taken before that Court. For this reason I think that we should order that all parties should have their costs out of the estate, those of the executor, between solicitor and client.\nIt is only necessary to mention briefly the other grounds of appeal that were argued. The first was that as a matter of construction, it should have been held that this was an absolute gift of residue. To me, this was clearly a gift in trust and I think that both Courts in British Columbia have correctly rejected this submission.\nThe other argument was that the Court of Appeal should have held, as did Wootton J., that this was a valid charitable trust in British Columbia. The Court of Appeal thought that this course was not open in view of the decision of the House of Lords in the Keren case, supra. It is clear that Wootton J. did not think that this decision concluded the matter for all time. He was sitting in 1963. A lot had happened in the world since 1932. He felt that this enabled him to find that there was an identifiable world community to be benefited by this disposition. In so finding I think that he was right but I recognize that my opinion on this branch of the case is obiter.\nI would allow the appeal and direct that all parties to these proceedings should have their costs throughout, those of the executor as between solicitor and client.\nAppeal dismissed, JUDSON and SPENCE JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Pearlman & Lindholm, Victoria.\nSolicitors for the respondent, Royal Trust Company: Cameron & Cameron, Victoria.\nSolicitors for the respondents, Clara Richter et al.: Crease & Co., Victoria.\n[1] (1964), 46 W.W.R. 577, 43 D.L.R.

II (1960), c. 39, ss. 2(4), 49, 71, 100\u2014B.N.A. Act, 1867, c. 3, ss. 41, 91, 92.\nThe appellants were convicted by a Justice of the Peace on a charge of unlawfully maintaining a sign on their premises contrary to a municipal zoning by-law. This sign, which was not within the type of signs specifically permitted by the by-law, was displayed during the period of a federal election and urged the people to vote for a certain candidate. The validity of the by-law or of the enabling provincial legislation was not raised, but the appellants contended that on its true construction the by-law was not intended to have the effect of forbidding the use of such a sign during the actual period of an election to the federal parliament. The conviction was quashed by a judge of the Supreme Court of Ontario, but it was restored by the Court of Appeal. The appellants were granted leave to appeal to this Court. Held (Fauteux, Martland, Ritchie and Hall JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the conviction set aside.\nPer Taschereau C.J. and Cartwright, Abbott, Judson and Spence JJ.: It could not have been the intention of the municipal council to enact a prohibition of the sort which the by-law, as construed by the Court of Appeal, contains, nor could it have been the intention of the legislature to empower it to do so. The legislature had no power to enact such a prohibition as it would be a law in relation to proceedings at a federal election and not in relation to any subject matter within the provincial power. The subject matter of elections to parliament appears to be from its very nature one which could not be regarded as coming within any of the classes of subjects assigned to the legislatures of the provinces by s. 92 of the B.N.A, Act. Consequently, on their proper construction, the general words of the by-law, which in their natural meaning do not merely regulate but forbid the display of signs at all times, were not intended to have effect so as to forbid during the actual period of an election to parliament the display of a sign of the sort described in the charge on which the appellants were convicted.\nPer Fauteux, Martland, Ritchie and Hall JJ., dissenting: The contention of the appellant that the by-law was not intended to have the effect of forbidding the use of such a sign during the period of a federal election, could not be supported. There is nothing in the provisions of the by-law which runs counter to any of the provisions of the Canada Elections Act. The contention that the field of proceedings at federal elections is one of federal jurisdiction and cannot be affected by provincial legislation, even though only incidentally, could not be supported. There is no general field of legislation on this subject assigned to the federal parliament under s. 91 of the B.N.A. Act to which the proviso of that section can attach. Therefore, provincial legislation in relation to the use of property, which, in its pith and substance, is in relation to property and civil rights in the province, and which is of general application, as in the present case, is not only valid, but can apply even though incidentally it may affect the means of propaganda used by an individual or by a political party during a federal election campaign.\nNor could the contention of the appellant be supported upon the ground that the displaying of the sign was the exercise of a political right in a federal election which could not be affected by any legislation other than federal. The provinces, legislating within their allotted sphere, may affect the carrying on of activities connected with federal elections. In the present case the proposition that, because a by-law of general application incidentally prevented a particular form of apolitical propaganda from being used in a particular area, this constituted a substantial interference with the working of the parliamentary institutions of Canada, could not be supported.\nDroit constitutionnel\u2014R\u00e8glement de zonage d\u00e9fendant les enseignes sur les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s priv\u00e9es\u2014Applicabilit\u00e9 aux enseignes pour les \u00e9lections f\u00e9d\u00e9rales\u2014Loi \u00e9lectorale du Canada, 8-9 Eliz.

Appel maintenu, les Juges Fauteux, Martland, Ritchie et Hall \u00e9tant dissidents.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1 reversing a judgment of Hughes J. Appeal allowed, Fauteux, Martland, Ritchie and Hall JJ., dissenting.\nA. Brewin, Q.C., and Miss Ruby Campbell, for the appellants.\nJohn S. Herron, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Taschereau C.J. and of Cartwright, Abbott, Judson and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014 This appeal is brought, pursuant to special leave granted by this Court, from an order of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[2] reversing an order of Hughes J. and affirming the conviction of the appellants by a Justice of the Peace which conviction had been quashed by the order of Hughes J.\nThe appellants were convicted before W.H. Williams Esquire, a Justice of the Peace, on November 2, 1962, on the charge that they during the two weeks preceding June 12, 1962, at the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto in the County of York, unlawfully did maintain a sign on the premises municipally known as 70 Roxaline Street in the Township of Etobicoke other than those permitted under Sections 9.3.1.7. and 6.14(e) of the Township of Etobicoke Zoning By-law 11737 contrary to Township of Etobicoke Zoning By-law 11737.\nThe relevant facts are not in dispute. The appellants are the owners of the premises known as Street number 70 Roxaline Street in the Township of Etobicoke. During the period set out in the charge they attached to the railing of the verandah forming part of their residence an election sign measuring 14 inches by 16 inches bearing the words:\u2014\u201cVote David Middleton, New Democratic Party\u201d. David Middleton was a candidate for election to the House of Commons at the general election which was held on June 18, 1962. He was a candidate for the electoral district in which 70 Roxaline Street is situate. It will be observed that the whole of the period during which the sign was displayed by the appellants was \u201cduring an election\u201d as that phrase is defined in the Canada Elections Act, 8-9 Elizabeth II, c. 39, s. 2(4).\nThe relevant provisions of by-law No. 11737 are as follows:\nSection 9.3.\u2014Subject to compliance with the regulations under section 6, the following regulations shall apply in an R2 zone.\nSection 9.3.1.\u2014USE: No building, structure or land shall be used and no building or structure shall be hereafter erected, structurally altered, enlarged or maintained except for the following uses:\nSection 9.3.1.7.\u2014SIGNS: Signs in accordance with the regulations in section 6.14(e).\nSection 6.14(e)\u2014SIGNS: Residential\u2014one non-illuminated real estate sign not exceeding four square feet in area, advertising the sale, rental or lease of any building, structure or lot and\/or one non-illuminated trespassing, safety or caution sign not exceeding one square foot in area, and\/or one sign indicating the name and profession of a physician shall be permitted. Bulletin boards advertising sub-divisions in which lots are for sale and\/or advertising building projects.\nIn the case of an apartment not more than one bulletin board not exceeding twelve square feet in area shall be permitted, provided that all such signs are located on the lot to which they relate.\n70 Roxaline Avenue is in an R2 zone.\nOn June 29, 1959, by-law 11737 was approved by order of the Ontario Municipal Board.\nNo question is raised by counsel for the appellants as to the validity either of this by-law or of the enabling legislation of the Province of Ontario pursuant to which it was passed. His submission is that, on its true construction, it does not forbid the conduct which the learned Justice of the Peace held to be an offence.\nIn framing those portions of the by-law with which we are concerned the Council has not enumerated the classes of signs the display of which on residential property is prohib- ited. It has taken the permissible course of forbidding the display of all signs except those few described in regulation 6.14(e). It results from this that the words of prohibition are extremely wide.\nIn construing the by-law two rules of construction are of assistance. The first is that conveniently expressed in the maxim, Verba generalia restringuntur ad habilitaient rei vel personae (Bac. Max. reg. 10) Broom\u2019s Legal Maxims, 10th ed., 438. The rule was regarded as already well established when Stradling v. Morgan[3] was decided in 1560 and it is scarcely necessary to quote authority in support of it. It is expressed as follows in Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes, 11th ed., at pages 58 and 59:\nIt is in the interpretation of general words and phrases that the principle of strictly adapting the meaning to the particular subject-matter with reference to which the words are used finds its most frequent application; However wide in the abstract, they are more or less elastic, and admit of restriction or expansion to suit the subject-matter. While expressing truly enough all that the legislature intended, they frequently express more in their literal meaning and natural force; and it is necessary to give them the meaning which best suits the scope and object of the statute without extending to ground foreign to the intention. It is, therefore, a canon of interpretation that all words, if they be general and not express and precise, are to be restricted to the fitness of the matter. They are to be construed as particular if the intention be particular, that is, they must be understood as used with reference to the subject-matter in the mind of the legislature, and limited to it.\nAn example of the application of the rule is the case of Cox v. Hakes[4], in which it was held by the House of Lords that the words of the statute there under consideration:\nThe Court of Appeal shall have jurisdiction and power to hear and determine appeals from any judgment or order of Her Majesty\u2019s High Court of Justice, or any judges or judge thereof.\ndid not give a right of appeal from an order discharging a prisoner under a writ of habeas corpus, although, as was pointed out by Lord Halsbury at page 517, the words literally construed were sufficient to comprehend such an order.\nThe second applicable rule of construction is that if an enactment, whether of Parliament or of a legislature or of a subordinate body to which legislative power is delegated, is capable of receiving a meaning according to which its operation is restricted to matters within the power of the enacting body it shall be interpreted accordingly. An alternative form in which the rule is expressed is that if words in a statute are fairly susceptible of two constructions of which one will result in the statute being intra vires and the other will have the contrary result the former is to be adopted. If authority is required in support of this rule, on which we have acted repeatedly, it may be found in the judgment of Duff C.J. in Reference as to the validity of section 31 of the Municipal District Act Amendment Act, 1941, of Alberta[5] and in Attorney General for Ontario v. Reciprocal Insurers[6].\nA municipal corporation which derives its legislative power from an act of the Provincial Legislature, of course, cannot have power to enact a provision which would be ultra vires of that legislature.\nIn the case at bar the learned Justice of the Peace and the Court of Appeal have given effect to the by-law as if it provided:\nDuring an election to Parliament no owner of property in an R2 zone in Etobicoke shall display on his property any sign soliciting votes for a candidate at such election.\nI cannot think that it was the intention of the Council to so enact or that it was the intention of the Legislature to empower it to do so. Such an enactment would, in my opinion, be ultra vires of the provincial legislature. The power of the legislature to enact such a law, if it exists, must be found in s. 92 of the British North America Act. It is argued for the respondent that it falls within head 13, \u201cProperty and Civil Rights in the Province.\u201d Whether or not the right of an elector at a federal election to seek by lawful means to influence his fellow electors to vote for the candidate of his choice is aptly described as a civil right need not be discussed; it is clearly not a civil right in the province. It is a right enjoyed by the elector not as a resident of Ontario but as a citizen of Canada.\nA political activity in the federal field which has theretofore been lawful can, in my opinion, be prohibited only by Parliament. This rule is, I think, implicit in every judgment delivered in this Court in the recent case of Oil Chemical and Atomic Workers International Union Local 16-601 V. Imperial Oil Ltd. et al.[7] The division of opinion in that case was not as to the soundness of the rule but as to whether the legislation there in question infringed it. The reasons of the majority, who upheld the provincial legislation which was under consideration, were given by Mart-land J. and by Ritchie J. Martland J. said, at page 594:\nThe legislation, however, does not affect the right of any individual to engage in any form of political activity which he may desire. It does not prevent a trade union from engaging in political activities.\nRitchie J. said at page 608:\nThe impugned legislation does not, in my view, have the effect of in any sense precluding any trade union from indulging in political activity or from collecting political party funds from its members.\nIf by-law 11737 is construed as it has been by the learned Justice of the Peace and by the Court of Appeal, it does not merely affect, it destroys the right of the appellants to engage in a form of political activity in the federal field which has heretofore been possessed and exercised by electors without question.\nI incline to agree with Mr. Brewin\u2019s submission that Parliament has \u201coccupied the field\u201d in enacting The Canada Elections Act and particularly s. 71 which reads as follows:\n71. Every printed advertisement, handbill, placard, poster or dodger having reference to any election shall bear the name and address of its printer and publisher, and any person printing, publishing, distributing or posting up, or causing to be printed, published, distributed or posted up, any such document unless it bears such name and address is guilty of an offence against this Act punishable on summary conviction as provided in this Act, and if he is a candidate or the official agent of a candidate is further guilty of an illegal practice.\nThis indicates that Parliament contemplates that persons other than candidates may post up placards and posters having reference to an election and subjects the practice to a limited form of regulation. The impugned by-law forbids such posting up altogether on residential property, which will often be the only place on which the owner of that property has the right to post up such a placard. However, I do not find it necessary to reach a definite conclusion on this branch of Mr. Brewin\u2019s argument. In my opinion, the legislature has no power to enact a prohibition of the sort which by-law 11737, as construed by the Court of Appeal, contains as such a prohibition would be a law in relation to proceedings at a federal election and not in relation to any subject-matter within the provincial power. As was said by Lord Watson in Union Colliery v. Bryden[8]:\nThe abstinence of the Dominion Parliament from legislating to the full limit of its powers, could not have the effect of transferring to any provincial legislature the legislative power which had been assigned to the Dominion by s. 91 of the Act of 1867.\nWhile that case dealt with an attempted invasion by the provincial legislature of a field exclusively reserved to Parliament by head 25 of s. 91 of the British North America Act, the subject matter of elections to Parliament appears to me to be from its very nature one which cannot be regarded as coming within any of the classes of subjects assigned to the legislatures of the provinces by section 92. As to this I agree with the following statement of Taschereau J., as he then was, in Valin v. Langlois[9]:\nIt is admitted, and is beyond doubt, that the Parliament of Canada has the exclusive power of legislation over Dominion controverted elections. By the lex Parliamentaria, as well as by the 41st, 91st, and 92nd sections of the British North America Act, this power is as complete as if it was specially and by name contained in the enumeration of the federal powers of section 91, just as promissory notes, Insolvency, &c., are.\nIt will be noted that the Judicial Committee in refusing leave to appeal stated that, although the questions dealt with in the judgment of this Court were undoubtedly of great importance, leave should be refused because the judgment sought to be appealed was clearly right; see Valin v. Langlois[10], particularly at page 122.\nIt is scarcely necessary to add that, just as the legislature cannot do indirectly what it cannot do directly, it cannot by using general words effect a result which would be beyond its powers if brought about by precise words. An enactment in general words which, if literally construed, would bring about such a result is one to which the maxim, Verba generalia restringuntur ad habilitatem rei vel personae, is peculiarly applicable.\nEarlier in these reasons I have stated that counsel for the appellants did not question the validity of the by-law or of the enabling provincial legislation, I should make it plain that this admission on his part depended upon the acceptance of his argument that on its proper construction the by-law did not prohibit the display of the sign in regard to which the appellants were convicted. It was implicit in his argument that if the by-law should be construed so as to prohibit that display it would be pro tanto invalid.\nFor these reasons I agree with the conclusion of Hughes J, that on its proper construction by\u2011law number 11737 does not prohibit the display of the sign displayed by the appellants during the period mentioned in the charge against them.\nBefore parting with the matter I wish to emphasize, perhaps needlessly, the limited scope of the question we are called upon to decide. The constitutional validity of any provincial legislation is not directly impugned; were it otherwise it would have been necessary to give the notices required by Rule 18. The discussion of the extent to which provincial legislation may affect the carrying on of a political activity in the federal field was raised by counsel and has been pursued in these reasons merely to assist in arriving at the true construction of the by-law. That question of construction is in turn confined to ascertaining whether the general words used, which in their natural meaning do not merely regulate but forbid the display of signs at all times, were intended to have effect so as to forbid during the actual period of an election to Parliament the display of a sign of the sort described in the charge on which the appellants were convicted.\nI would allow the appeal with costs in this Court and in the Court of Appeal, set aside the order of the Court of Appeal and restore the order of Hughes J.\nThe judgment of Fauteux, Martland, Ritchie and Hall JJ. was delivered by\nMARTLAND J. (dissenting):\u2014 This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[11], which reversed the decision of Hughes J., and affirmed the conviction of the appellants by a Justice of the Peace, for having unlawfully maintained a sign upon premises owned by them contrary to the provisions of By-law 11737 of the Township of Etobicoke. The by-law in question is a zoning by-law, which, inter alia, forbade the use of a building, structure or land within the area in which the appellants\u2019 land was situated for signs, save those for certain specified purposes. The sign in question, attached to the railing of the verandah of a residence, and which read: \u201cVote Middleton, New Democratic Party\u201d, was not within the specified permitted types of sign.\nIt was admitted, in argument, that the by-law in question was intra vires of the municipality. The contention of the appellants is that the by-law was not intended to have the effect of forbidding the use of such a sign during the actual period of an election to the federal Parliament.\nThis contention was supported upon two grounds:\n1. That the displaying of such a sign was subject exclusively to federal legislation, as being in relation to \u201cProceedings at Elections\u201d, within the meaning of s. 41 of the British North America Act; and\n2. That the displaying of the sign was a political right of the appellants which was not affected by the by-law.\nAs to the first point, s. 41 was an interim provision of the British North America Act, which provided that certain then existing provincial laws should apply to the election of members to serve in the House of Commons from the several provinces, until the Parliament of Canada otherwise provided. Parliament did so provide, and the effect of s. 41 has been exhausted. The law relating to proceedings at federal elections is now to be found in the Canada Elections Act, Chapter 39, Statutes of Canada, 1960.\nThe appellants contended that certain provisions in that Act recognized implicitly the right to erect signs.\nThe sections relied upon were the following:\n49. (3) No person shall furnish or supply any loud speaker, bunting, ensign, banner, standard or set of colours, or any other flag, to any person with intent that it shall be carried, worn or used on automobiles, trucks or other vehicles, as political propaganda, on the ordinary polling day; and no person shall, with any such intent, carry, wear or use, on automobiles, trucks or other vehicles, any such loud speaker, bunting, ensign, banner, standard or set of colours, or any other flag, on the ordinary polling day.\n(4) No person shall furnish or supply any flag, ribbon, label or like favour to or for any person with intent that it be worn or used by any person within any electoral district on the day of election or polling, or within two days before such day, or during the continuance of such election, by any person, as a party badge to distinguish the wearer as the supporter of any candidate, or of the political or other opinions enter- tained or supposed to be entertained by such candidate; and no person shall use or wear any flag, ribbon, label, or other favour, as such badge, within any electoral district on the day of any such election or polling, or within two days before such day.\n* * *\n71. Every printed advertisement, handbill, placard, poster or dodger having reference to any election shall bear the name and address of its printer and publisher, and any person printing, publishing, distributing or posting up, or causing to be printed, published, distributed or posted up, any such document unless it bears such name and address is guilty of an offence against this Act punishable on summary conviction as provided in this Act, and if he is a candidate or the official agent of a candidate is further guilty of an illegal practice.\n* * *\n100. (1) When any election officer is by this Act authorized or required to give a public notice and no special mode of notification is indicated, the notice may be by advertisement, placard, handbill or otherwise as he considers will best effect the intended purpose.\n(2) Notices and other documents required by this Act to be posted up may, notwithstanding the provisions of any law of Canada or of a province or of any municipal ordinance or by-law, be affixed by means of tacks or pins to any wooden fence situated on or adjoining any highway, or by means of tacks, pins, gum or paste on any post or pole likewise situated, and such documents shall not be affixed to fences or poles in any manner otherwise.\nI cannot find in any of these provisions any recognition by Parliament, express or implied, of an overriding right to erect anywhere a sign for purposes of political propaganda.\nSubsections (3) and (4) of s. 49 contain prohibitions against the supplying and use of certain kinds of election propaganda on polling day, and during certain other periods.\nSection 71 requires printed advertisements, handbills, placards, posters or dodgers having reference to an election to carry the name and address of the printer and publisher.\nSection 100 is the only one of the provisions mentioned which contains enabling, rather than restrictive, provisions. It deals with the posting of official notices required under the Act. It authorizes their posting in certain ways and in certain places. It is significant that subs. (2) contains the words \u201cnotwithstanding the provisions of any law of Canada or of a province or of any municipal ordinance or by-law\u201d, thereby recognizing that, in the absence of the authority of this section, even the posting of official notices in certain places might properly be forbidden by a provincial statute or a municipal by-law. In my opinion there is nothing in the provisions of the by-law relating to the erection of signs which runs counter to any of the provisions of the Canada Elections Act.\nIt is, however, contended that, even though Parliament has not legislated on this subject, the field of proceedings at federal elections is one of federal jurisdiction and cannot be affected by provincial legislation, even though it is so affected only incidentally. Reliance is placed upon the statement of Lord Watson in Union Colliery v. Bryden[12]:\nThe abstinence of the Dominion Parliament from legislating to the full limit of its powers, could not have the effect of transferring to any provincial legislature the legislative power which had been assigned to the Dominion by s. 91 of the Act of 1867.\nIn that case the issue was as to the validity of a provision regarding Chinese men in a British Columbia statute which provided that:\nno boy under the age of twelve years, and no woman or girl of any age, and no Chinaman, shall be employed in or allowed to be for the purpose of employment in any mine to which the Act applies, below ground.\nThe Privy Council held that the provision relating exclusively to Chinese men, who are aliens or naturalized subjects, was within exclusive federal jurisdiction under s. 91(25), and was ultra vires of the British Columbia Legislature.\nThe basis of the decision is set forth by Lord Watson at p. 587:\nBut the leading feature of the enactments consists in this\u2014that they have, and can have, no application except to Chinamen who are aliens or naturalized subjects, and that they establish no rule or regulation except that these aliens or naturalized subjects shall not work, or be allowed to work, in underground coal mines within the Province of British Columbia.\nThis legislation was held to be bad in so far as Chinese men were concerned because the provincial legislature had singled out for its legislation a group within the heading \u201cnaturalization and aliens\u201d. It is, however, implicit in the reasons that provincial legislation dealing with coal mines, applicable to men in a certain age group, would not only be valid but would apply to Chinese men within that group. There was no suggestion that the provision in issue was not valid in relation to boys, or that it could not apply to Chinese boys under the age of twelve years. It should also be noted that the statement of Lord Watson cited by the appellants, deals with those legislative powers conferred upon the federal Parliament under the specifically enumerated heads of s. 91 of the British North America Act, which section concludes with the provision, relied upon by Lord Watson in his reasons (at p. 585), that\nany matter coming within any of the classes of subjects enumerated in this section shall not be deemed to come within the class of matters of a local or private nature comprised in the enumeration of the classes of subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces.\nThere is no class of subject within the enumerated heads of s. 91 which deals with \u201cproceedings at elections\u201d. That phrase appears in s. 41. It was there used as a description of a subject matter already covered by certain existing provincial laws; i.e., \u201cproceedings at elections\u201d was defined by the terms of those provincial statutes.\nUndoubtedly the federal Parliament can legislate and has legislated respecting federal elections. To the extent that it has legislated, such legislation governs and would override any provincial enactment which ran counter to it. The point which I make is that there is no general field of legislation on this subject assigned to the federal Parliament under an enumerated class in s. 91 to which the proviso at the conclusion of that section can attach.\nThat being so, in my opinion, provincial legislation in relation to the use of property, which, in its pith and substance, is in relation to property and civil rights in the province, and which is of general application, is not only valid, but can apply even though, incidentally, it may affect the means of propaganda used by an individual or by a political party during a federal election campaign.\nThe only authority to which we were referred in support of this doctrine of non-applicability was the Reference regarding the Minimum Wage Act of Saskatchewan[13]. That was a reference to determine whether The Minimum Wage Act, R.S.S. 1940, c. 310, applied to the employment of Leo Fleming in the post office at Maple Creek, Saskatchewan. Fleming had been employed temporarily by the postmistress of a revenue post office in December, 1946, and she had been charged with a breach of that Act. There was no suggestion that the Act purported to be applicable generally to federal civil servants. The decision that it did not apply to Fleming\u2019s employment was that, though he was paid by the postmistress out of her postal revenues, he was employed in the business of the Post Office of Canada and was a part of the postal service. That being so, the terms of his employment were the subject matter of federal legislation. In essence, the decision was that provincial legislation as to wages did not apply to federal Crown servants, even though not paid directly by the Crown. It does not support the very wide proposition urged by the appellants in the present case.\nIn Attorney-General for Alberta v. Attorney-General for Canada[14], the Bill entitled \u201cAn Act respecting the Taxation of Banks\u201d was held to be ultra vires of the Alberta Legislature, not because a provincial taxing statute could not apply to banks, but because it applied only to banks and because its true purpose was not taxation to raise provincial revenue but the prevention of the operation of banks in the province.\nIn Great West Saddlery Company Limited v. The King[15], the questions in issue involved the validity of certain provincial statutes affecting the position of companies incorporated under the provisions of the Canadian Companies Act. One of the statutes under consideration was the Ontario Mortmain and Charitable Uses Act. It was held that a federal company was subject to the provisions of this Act, because it was one of general application.\nThis, I think, is an answer to the suggestion that, if the municipality could not have enacted a by-law aimed exclusively at federal election signs, then a general by-law could not be applicable to them. The essential feature of the by-law in question here is that it is of general application and, admittedly, valid.\nI turn now to deal specifically with the second head of the appellants\u2019 argument, although what has already been said is, in part, applicable to that submission. The contention is that the displaying of the sign by the applicants was the exercise of a political right in a federal election which would not be affected by any legislation other than federal. The appellants relied mainly upon the decisions of this Court in Saumur v. The City of Quebec[16]; Switzman v. Sibling[17]; and the reasons of Chief Justice Duff in the Reference re Alberta Statutes[18].\nThe first case involved an attack by a member of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses upon the validity of a by-law of the City of Quebec, which forbade distribution in the streets of the City of books and pamphlets without permission of the Chief of Police of the City. Four of the members of the Court who found the by-law to be invalid were of the view that the true purpose of the by-law was not in relation to the administration of streets, but to exercise censorship, interfering with freedom of religious worship, a subject matter of federal legislation.\nKerwin J, held that the by-law could not operate to prevent the distribution of the literature of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses because of the protection afforded to freedom of religious worship by a pre-Confederation statute of 1852 and by the Freedom of Worship Act of the Province of Quebec.\nFour members of the Court would have held the by-law to be valid.\nIn the present case, however, the by-law is admittedly valid and there has been no suggestion that its aim and purpose was anything other than the maintenance of certain standards of amenity in residential areas in the Township. This being so, I would adopt, in relation to this issue, what was said by Cartwright J. in the Saumur case respecting provincial legislation which might affect religion. At p. 387 he said:\nIt may well be that Parliament alone has power to make laws in relation to the subject of religion as such, that that subject is, in its nature, one which concerns Canada as a whole and so cannot be regarded as of a merely local or private nature in any province or as a civil right in any province; but we are not called upon to decide that question in this appeal and I express no opinion upon it. I think it clear that the provinces, legislating within their allotted sphere, may affect the carrying on of activities connected with the practice of religion. For example, there are many municipal by-laws in force in cities in Ontario, passed pursuant to powers conferred by the Provincial Legislature, which provide that no buildings other than private residences shall be erected on certain streets. Such by-laws are, in my opinion, clearly valid although they prevent any religions body from building a church or similar edifice on such streets. Another example of Provincial Legislation which might be said to interfere directly with the free exercise of religious profession is that under which the by-law considered in Re Cribbin v. The City of Toronto, (1891) 21 O.R. 325, was passed. That was a by-law of the City of Toronto which provided in part:\u2014\nNo person shall on the Sabbath-day, in any public park, square, garden, or place for exhibition in the city of Toronto, publicly preach, lecture or declaim.\nThe by-law was attacked on the ground, inter alia, that it was unconstitutional but it was upheld by Galt C.J. and in my opinion, his decision was right. No useful purpose would be served by endeavouring to define the limits of the provincial power to pass legislation affecting the carrying on of activities connected with the practice of religion. The better course is, I think, to deal only with the particular legislation now before us.\nSwitzman v. Sibling also involved the question of constitutional validity of legislation, in this case the Quebec Act respecting Communistic Propaganda. The majority of the Court held that the statute was legislation in respect of criminal law. Three members of the Court held that it was not within any of the powers specifically assigned to the provinces and that it constituted an unjustifiable interference with freedom of speech.\nIn each of these cases some of the reasons have recognized the existence of fields of federal legislative jurisdiction in relation to freedom of religion (Saumur) and freedom of speech (Switzman). In each of these cases this view was expressed in relation to legislation which the judges expressing that view had found not to fall within any head of s. 92.\nThe source of this opinion as to such fields of federal jurisdiction is the judgment of Chief Justice Duff in the Reference re Alberta Legislation. He was dealing with Bill No. 9, passed by the Alberta Legislature, but which had not received royal assent, \u201cTo Ensure the Publication of Accurate News and Information\u201d. This bill would have required newspapers which published material criticizing the provincial government to publish a corrective or amplifying statement if required by a government board.\nChief Justice Duff held that this Bill presupposed, as a condition of its operation, that the Alberta Social Credit Act was valid, and, since that Act was held to be ultra vires of the Province, the ancillary and dependent legislation fell with it.\nIn his reasons, however, he suggested another ground on which it might be contended that the Bill was invalid, but expressed no view as to whether or not it would be unconstitutional as offending against that proposition.\nHis well known statement is as follows, at p. 134:\nThe question, discussed in argument, of the validity of the legislation before us, considered as a wholly independent enactment having no relation to the Alberta Social Credit Act, presents no little difficulty. Some degree of regulation of newspapers everybody would concede to the provinces. Indeed, there is a very wide field in which the provinces undoubtedly are invested with legislative authority over newspapers; but the limit, in our opinion, is reached when the legislation effects such a curtailment of the exercise of the right of public discussion as substantially to interfere with the working of the parliamentary institutions of Canada as contemplated by the provisions of The British North America Act and the statutes of the Dominion of Canada.\nIt is significant that this statement clearly recognizes that a province has a right to regulate newspapers. Any such regulation must, to some extent, be a curtailment of unlimited freedom of discussion. Chief Justice Duff said that such provincial control could not go beyond a certain point, which he defined.\nHis views were concurred in by Davis J. Cannon J. was of the view that a province could not curtail free discussion of public affairs, this being within the federal field of criminal law. The other three members of the Court expressed no view regarding this point.\nAssuming the correctness of the proposition stated by Chief Justice Duff and the existence of federal legislative powers in the field of freedom of religion and freedom of discussion, there is no case as yet which has ruled that provincial legislation not directed at those fields, but validly enacted in relation to property and civil rights, cannot, incidentally, effect any curtailment of the same.\nEarlier in his reasons, Chief Justice Duff said, at p. 133:\nThe right of public discussion is, of course, subject to legal restrictions; those based upon considerations of decency and public order, and others conceived for the protection of various private and public interests with which, for example, the laws of defamation and sedition are concerned. In a word, freedom of discussion means, to quote the words of Lord Wright in James v. Commonwealth, (1936) A.C. 578, at 627, \u201cfreedom governed by law.\u201d\nIt is significant that of the two examples which he chose, one, the law of defamation, was a provincial matter, the other, sedition, a federal one.\nFreedom of discussion is not an unlimited right to urge views, political or other, at any time, in any place, and in any manner. It is a freedom subject to law, and, depending on the nature of the legislation involved, may be subject to certain restrictions, whether federal or provincial.\nIn Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers International Union v. Attorney-General of British Columbia[19], the appellant urged that provincial legislation preventing the use of union dues, paid as a condition of membership, for contribution to a political party, or candidate, was not within any head of s. 92 and interfered with freedom of political activity. The majority of this Court held that the legislation was in pith and substance labour legislation and within provincial powers.\nCounsel for the appellant in that case placed reliance on the passage quoted from the judgment of Chief Justice Duff and urged that the legislation in question effected such a curtailment of the right of association for political purposes as to fall within the proposition there stated.\nDealing with that submission I said, at p. 594:\nThe legislation, however, does not affect the right of any individual to engage in any form of political activity which he may desire. It does not prevent a trade union from engaging in political activities. It does not prevent it from soliciting funds from its members for political purposes, or limit, in any way, the expenditure of funds so raised. It does prevent the use of funds, which are obtained in particular ways, from being used for political purposes.\nIn the same case Ritchie J. said, at p. 608:\nEven if it could be said that the legislation under attack (s. 9(6), (c) and (d)) had any effect on political elections such an effect could, in my view, only be characterized as incidental and this would not alter the fact that the amendment in question is a part and parcel of legislation passed \u201cin relation to\u201d labour relations and not \u201cin relation to\u201d elections either provincial or federal.\nThe test stated by Chief Justice Duff, assuming it is a sound proposition of constitutional law, is one for the determination of the validity of provincial legislation. That issue is not before us here. This by-law is admittedly valid. There is no suggestion in the reasons of Chief Justice Duff that, if provincial legislation regulating newspapers did not go beyond the limit which he defined, the legislation would be inapplicable in so far as it effected any curtailment of public discussion during a federal election.\nFurthermore, applying his test to the circumstances of the present case, I would not accept the proposition that, because a by-law of general application incidentally prevented a particular form of political propaganda from being used in a particular area, this constituted a substantial interference with the working of the parliamentary institutions of Canada.\nIn my opinion the appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs, Fauteux, Martland, Ritchie and Hall JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Cameron, Brewin, McCallum & Scott, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the respondent: McMaster, Montgomery & Co., Toronto.\n[1] [1964] 1 O.R. 641, 43 D.L.R.

(Defendants) Respondents.\n1965: March 22, 23; 1965: June 24.\nPresent: Cartwright, Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nWills\u2014Construction\u2014Bequest to testator\u2019s daughter for life with direction for distribution upon her decease to those persons entitled as if testator had died intestate\u2014Whether next-of-kin to be determined at date of testator\u2019s death or at date of death of life tenant.\nThe testator, by para. 11(a) of his will, directed that the remainder of his estate was to be incorporated in a trust fund to be held by his trustees with direction to pay his daughter at least $5,000 a year from the income and if necessary from the capital and to the capital of which she could only otherwise have access if the trustees in their absolute discretion considered the sum of $5,000 annually to be insufficient for her proper support and maintenance. It was provided, by para. 11(c), that upon her decease a specified amount was to be divided among nephews and nieces of the testator and the remainder of the corpus was to be divided as follows: one-half to the testator\u2019s brother or his heirs, and the remaining one-half \u201cto such persons as will be entitled thereto according to the Statute of Distribution in force in the Province of Ontario as if I had died intestate in respect thereto.\u201d The question raised was whether the statutory next-of-kin were to be determined at the date of death of the testator, in which event the executor of the estate of the daughter was solely entitled, or whether they were to be determined at the date of the death of the daughter, in which event four nephews and three nieces would take.\nOn a motion for construction the judge of first instance applied the general rule (established in Bullock v. Dowries (1860), 9 H.L.C. 1) that the class is determined at the date of death of the testator unless a contrary intention appears from the will. He was unable to find a contrary intention. The Court of Appeal did find a contrary intention and held that the class was to be ascertained at the date of the death of the life tenant. The executor of the daughter\u2019s estate appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Judson J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Cartwright and Martland JJ.: The authority of the rule of construction stated in Bullock v. Dowries, applied by this Court in Thompson v. Smith (1897), 27 S.C.R. 628, was not impaired by subsequent decisions in Ontario. That rule, however, would yield to a sufficient indication in the words of the will that the next-of-kin were to be ascertained not at the death of the testator but at the time fixed by the will as the period of distribution. In the case at bar a sufficient indication that the testator intended that his next-of-kin should be ascertained at the death of his daughter was to be found in the clauses of para. 11 of the will.\nPer Martland, Ritchie and Spence JJ.: In the construction of wills, the primary purpose was to determine the intention of the testator and it was only when such intention could not be arrived at with certainty by giving the natural and ordinary meaning to the words used by him that resort was to be had to the rules of construction developed by the Courts in the interpretation of other wills.\nIt was apparent that the testator intended the whole of the corpus of his estate to be preserved intact during the lifetime of his daughter subject to the payments which the trustees were authorized to make. The result of applying the rule in Bullock v. Dowries to this will was to ignore the carefully drawn provisions setting up the trust and to attribute to the testator the contrary intention to provide for his daughter in such manner as to enable her to obtain a substantial part of the fund for her own use absolutely without the exercise of any authority or discretion by the trustees and whether or not the whole fund produced an income of $5,000 a year.\nThe inconsistency which resulted from the application of this rule to the language used in paras. 11(a) and 11(c) of the will was itself a sufficient indication that the testator did not intend the ultimate beneficiaries under para, 11(c) to be those entitled under The Devolution of Estates Act at the date of his death, but rather that he intended one-half of the remainder of the corpus of his estate to be divided amongst the persons so entitled at the date of the death of his daughter. Hutchinson v. National Refuges for Homeless and Destitute Children, [1920] A.C. 794; Lucas-Tooth v. Lucas-Tooth, [1921] 1 A.C. 594, referred to.\nPer Judson J., dissenting: The reasoning which led the judge of first instance to find that there was no contrary intention was sound and should be accepted. He thought that the testator meant what he said and that he intended to die intestate with respect to one-half of the residue; that he did not know whether or not his daughter would be living at his death, nor could he tell who his next-of-kin might be at that time. Whoever they were, they were the ones to take.\nThe mere fact that the life tenant and the person who would take if the class were ascertained as of the date of death of the testator were one and the same person was not an indication of a contrary intention.\nRe Young (1928), 62 O.L.R. 275; Jones v.

Collins-Williams, Q.C., for the respondents: National Trust Co. Ltd., Harold Learoyd Steele and William E. Fleury.\nMartland J. concurred with the judgment delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014The question raised on this appeal and the relevant provisions of the will of the late Herbert W. Fleury are set out in the reasons of other members of the Court.\nI have reached the conclusion that the appeal fails but, in view of some of the expressions used in the reasons of the Court of Appeal1 as to the effect of the decisions there discussed, I propose to state shortly my opinion as to the present state of the law in Ontario on the point with which we are concerned. In my view the authority of the rule of construction stated by Lord Campbell in Bullock v. Dowries[2], at p. 11, quoted by my brother Ritchie and applied by this Court in Thompson v. Smith[3], is not impaired by the subsequent decisions in Ontario. That rule, however, will yield to a sufficient indication in the words of the will that the next-of-kin are to be ascertained not at the death of the testator but at the time fixed by the will as the period of distribution.\nFor the reasons given by my brother Ritchie I agree with his conclusion that a sufficient indication that the testator intended that his next-of-kin should be ascertained at the death of his daughter is to be found in the clauses of para. 11 of the will. I am somewhat fortified in this view by the use of the plural number and the future tense in the words which I have italicized in the following extract from that paragraph:\n(c) Upon the decease of my daughter Marguerite W. Fleury to distribute the corpus of my estate as follows:\u2026 and the remaining one-half to such persons as will be entitled thereto according to the Statute of Distribution in force in the Province of Ontario as if I had died intestate in respect thereto.\nI would dispose of the appeal as proposed by my brother Ritchie.\nJUDSON J. (dissenting):\u2014The testator directed by para. (11) (c) of his will that the remainder of his estate should be disposed of as follows:\n(c) Upon the decease of my daughter Marguerite W. Fleury to distribute the corpus of my estate as follows: The sum of Eighty Thousand Dollars ($80,000.00) shall be divided amongst, between or to the first cousins of my said daughter, being Nephews and Nieces of mine, or their children, per stirpes in being at the decease of my daughter.\nThe remainder of the corpus of my estate to be divided as follows:\u2014One-half to my brother William J. Fleury or his heirs; and the remaining one-half to such persons as will be entitled thereto according to the Statute of Distribution in force in the Province of Ontario as if I had died intestate in respect thereto.\nIt is common ground that the gift under consideration in this litigation is to the next-of-kin determined in accordance with The Devolution of Estates Act, and the whole question is whether the statutory next-of-kin are to be determined at the date of the death of the testator, in which event National Trust Company Limited, as executor of the estate of the daughter, is solely entitled, or whether they are to be determined at the date of death of the daughter, in which event four nephews and three nieces would take.\nOn a motion for construction the judge of first instance, Hughes J., applied the general rule that the class is determined at the date of the death of the testator unless a contrary intention appears from the will. He was unable to find any contrary intention. The Court of Appeal[4] did find a contrary intention and held that the class was to be ascertained at the date of the death of the life tenant. The executor of the daughter\u2019s estate now appeals to this Court.\nTo me, the scheme of the will is uncomplicated and I do not think that any help can be derived from any of its terms until the testator comes to the disposition of the residue. The daughter was to have the net income from the estate for life with the provision that if this did not produce $5,000 per year, the trustees were to encroach on the residue in order to produce this sum. There was a further direction that if the trustees did not think that $5,000 per year was enough for the proper support and maintenance of the daughter, they were again to encroach on capital as they deemed necessary or advisable. They were told that in exercising their discretion that the testator wished them to treat the daughter generously. Then he came to the disposition of the residue, which I have set out above. The $80,000, which was first to be taken out of the residue to be divided among nephews and nieces, was reduced by two subsequent codicils, first, to $60,000, and then to $40,000.\nThe Court of Appeal, in determining the class at the date of distribution, said that the testator must have assumed that his daughter, his only next-of-kin at the date of the will, would survive him and that the wording of the residuary clause was an inappropriate expression of an intention to benefit his only child or her estate. With respect, I cannot reach the same conclusion. The testator made provision for his daughter during her lifetime and for his nieces and nephews who at the date of the will were known to him as being his probable next-of-kin if his daughter were not, and he used language which would cover all eventualities. He chose to benefit as to one-half of the residue his next-of-kin, whoever they might be. A contrary intention does not sufficiently appear merely from the fact that by the will a prior particular estate is limited to a particular-person who presumably would and, in fact, did turn out to be the person satisfying the definition.\nThe Court of Appeal also found a contrary intention in the fact that the daughter, being entitled to the life interest and one half of the residue, might have been in a position to demand immediate payment of this half of the residue. If this is the result of the dispositions in the will, it flows from the law and not from any expression used by the testator. In most cases where a beneficiary of income has been held entitled to demand immediate transfer of the corpus of the fund, the testator has not contemplated this result but principles of law have caused it to happen.\nNor do I think that a contrary intention is indicated by the use of words of futurity in the concluding clause of para. (11)(c) \u201cand the remaining one-half to such persons as will be entitled thereto according to the Statute of Distribution in force in the Province of Ontario as if I had died intestate in respect thereto.\u201d The words of futurity, in my opinion, refer to the time when this one-half of the residue will come into possession and do not determine when the class is to be ascertained.\nNor can I see any significance in the fact that the persons who take under the will of the deceased daughter are strangers in blood to the testator. The claimant is the estate of the daughter as next-of-kin of the father and what she may have chosen to do with her own estate can have nothing to do with the interpretation of her father\u2019s will.\nIn my opinion, the reasoning which led Hughes J. to find that there was no contrary intention is sound and should be accepted. He thought that the testator meant what he said and that he intended to die intestate with respect to this half of the residue; that he did not know whether or not his daughter would be living at his death, nor could he tell who his next-of-kin might be at that time. Whoever they were, they were the ones to take.\nHughes J. also noted that the testator directed his attention to his nephews and nieces, who are the alternative claimants here. He divided $80,000 among them per stirpes and then reduced that sum by two separate codicils. It was a significant fact that he specifically ascertained this class of nephews and nieces at the death of the daughter and that he refrained from making such an ascertainment with respect to the second half of the estate.\nThe course of litigation in Ontario on this type of problem has been full of meaning and should determine the construction of this will in the way in which Hughes J. construed it.\nThe Court of Appeal took as its starting point the decision of Middleton J.A., sitting in Weekly Court, in Re Young.[5] It is a convenient starting point because of its review of the litigation in the first half of the 19th century in England. The review of the English cases begins with Jones v. Colbeck[6], where there was a residuary bequest to a daughter for life, then to her children at the ages of 21, and after the death of the daughter and of her children under that age, the residue was to be distributed among the testator\u2019s relations in due course of administration. The daughter, who was a widow, died after the death of the testator without leaving issue. Great-nephews and nieces claimed in competition with the estate of the daughter and the result of the judgment was that the class of relations was ascertained at the date of the death of the daughter. I note that Theobald on Wills, 12th ed., has this comment on the case:\nThe term relations, however, has not the same direct reference to the death of the propositus as heirs or next-of-kin. Therefore, where there is a gift either to A for life with remainder to her children, or to A absolutely followed by a gift over, if A dies without issue, to the testator\u2019s relations, and A is the sole next-of-kin at the date of the will and death, the class will be ascertained at A\u2019s death.\nThis case and those that purported to follow it cannot be cited for any general proposition that where the life tenant is also the same person as the next-of-kin if ascertained at the date of death of the testator, this is an indication that the next-of-kin are to be ascertained at the date of death of the life tenant because the testator could not mean by his next-of-kin the very person to whom he was giving the life interest.\nIn Thompson v. Smith[7], Chancellor Boyd applied Jones v. Colbeck literally where a testator gave a life interest to his daughter and her mother for their joint lives and to the survivor of them, and directed that at the death of both \u201cthe residue of my real and personal property shall be enjoyed by and go to the benefit of my lawful heirs\u201d. Both survived the testator, the daughter surviving the mother. At the date of death of the testator the daughter was his only heir.\nChancellor Boyd excluded the estate of the daughter and held that the class of heirs was to be ascertained at the date of deaith of the daughter. This was rejected both on appeal in Ontario[8], and on appeal to this Court[9], where Sedge-wick J. said:\nI take it to be reasonably clear that this contention cannot prevail. The rule established in Bullock v. Downes, 9 H.L. Caff. 1, is that where in a case like the present the testator uses the word \u201cheirs\u201d, he must be taken to mean heirs at the time of his death unless the contrary contention is apparent from the will. This rule was subsequently followed and applied in Mortimore v. Mortimore, 4 App. Cas. 448, and in Re Ford; Patten v. Sparks, 72 L.T.N.S., 5.\nI take this to be an accurate and binding statement of what has been referred to as the rule established in Bullock v. Downes[10]. Nevertheless, Middleton J.A., p. 280, said that both the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Canada proceeded\nentirely upon the theory that Bullock v. Downes, particularly as expounded in Mortimore v. Mortimore (1879), 4 App. Cas. 448, and Re Ford, Patten v. Sparks (1895), 72 L.T.R. 5, had established an inflexible rule that in all these cases the date of the testator\u2019s death could be alone regarded.\nI do not think that any such inflexible rule was either established or applied in either Court.\nThere is no conflict between the rule stated in this Court and the way it was expressed in Hood v. Murray[11], and in Hutchinson v. National Refuges for Homeless and Destitute Children[12]. In the latter case, at p. 801, Lord Finlay said:\nBullock v. Downes, 9 H.L.C. 12, 13, therefore decides that, prima facie, the next of kin are to be ascertained at the death of the testator, but, that if there is a sufficient indication to that effect in the words of the will, the time for ascertaining the class may be the time fixed by the will as the period of distribution. The question in this as in every other case of the kind must be whether there is in the will a sufficient indication that the period of distribution is the time at which the class is to be ascertained.\nUnder this will, who are the persons who will be entitled to the second half of the estate \u201caccording to the Statute of Distribution in force in the Province of Ontario as if I had died intestate in respect thereto\u201d? There can only be one meaning to this, that is, the daughter, the sole next-of-kin and the one entitled under The Devolution of Estates Act. The question is whether the testator by the terms of this will was thinking of an artificial class of persons who would be entitled as next\u2011of\u2011kin if he, the testator, had survived to the date of distribution. I cannot see on the face of this will that he was thinking of any such artificial class and there are no other indications external to the residuary disposition that throw any light on this subject one way or the other. The mere fact that the life tenant and the person who would take if the class is ascertained as of the date of the death of the testator are one and the same person, is not an indication of a contrary intention.\nThis artificial class of persons was found to be indicated in the Hutchinson case and it is well, in considering the reasons for judgment, to look at the disposition that was under consideration. The testator gave his residuary personal estate upon trust after the death or remarriage of his wife for his three daughters and their respective children in equal shares with cross limitations among them. He also directed:\nthat on failure of all the trusts hereinbefore declared of the residue of my personal estate such residue shall be in trust for such person or persons as on the failure of such trusts shall be my next of kin and entitled to my personal estate under the Statutes for the Distribution of Estate of Intestates, such persons if more than one to take distributively according to the said Statutes.\nFor myself, I think that there is a plain indication in this will that the next-of-kin would be ascertained only when it became apparent that the trusts had failed, and not on the date of the death of the testator. I cannot see this case as a new point of departure in the consideration of this problem. It is no more than a finding of a contrary intention on the wording of the will.\nRose C.J.H.C. considered this problem again ten years after Re Young in Re Allan[13]. I quote from his judgment at pp. 2 and 3:\nIt is suggested that the testatrix cannot have intended that upon the death of Frederick Hugh Allan without issue any portion of the part of the estate set aside for him should descend to his representatives. Attention is directed to the fact that one one-fourth part of the estate of the testatrix is given outright to her son Thomas Martin Livingstone Allan if he survives, whereas in the case of the parts set aside for other children (including Frederick Hugh Allan) the income only is given to the child; and it is suggested that a construction which vests in Frederick Hugh Allan an interest in remainder in the part given to him for life will place him to a certain extent upon an equal footing with his brother Thomas Martin Livingstone Allan. It is also to be noted that the testatrix makes no provision for the widow of a son, or the surviving husband of a daughter, for whom a part of her estate is set aside, and it is suggested that a construction which will cause a portion of the part set aside for Frederick Hugh Allan to descend to his widow is a construction which may defeat the wishes of the testatrix. The learned Chief Justice said that he could not find in any of this a sufficient indication that the testatrix intended that the ordinary rule should not be followed. Certainly the mere fact that the heirs, if the class is ascertained as at the date of the death of the testatrix, will include the life tenant is not sufficient. This is made plain by the text writers and the cases cited by them. Thus in Theobald on Wills, 7th ed., 340, it is said: \u201cIf the gift is to the heir of the testator, the heir must be ascertained at the death of the testator, though the gift to the heir is after a life interest to the person who is the heir.\u201d And in Jarman on Wills, 7th ed., 1551, it is said: \u201cAnd since a departure from the rule leads to frequent inconveniences, slight circumstances or conjectural probability will not prevent an adherence to it. Thus it is not enough that the heir has an express estate in the same property limited to him in a previous part of the will.\u201d\nRe Campbell[14], Re Hughson[15], Re Jones[16] and Re Colby[17] are all uniform and in line to the effect that identity of the life tenant with the person who would be the next-of-kin at the date of death of the testator is not in itself an indication of a contrary intention. Re Pennock[18] seems to be out of line with these decisions. It is important for the orderly administration of the law of property, where the problem is so clearly identifiable, that the mode of approach which was stated in this Court and in the Ontario Court of Appeal over seventy years ago should be adhered to.\nI would allow the appeal and restore the judgment of Hughes J. The trustees of the will of Marguerite Fleury and the trustees of the will of William E. Fleury should have their costs out of this part of the residue on a solicitor and client basis both here and in the Court of Appeal. There should be no order for costs for the individual respondents in either Court.\nMartland and Spence JJ. concurred with the judgment delivered by RITCHIE J.:\u2014This appeal is concerned with the true construction to be placed on the provision made by the late Herbert W. Fleury in para. 11(c) of his will for the disposition of one-half of the remainder of the corpus of his estate on his daughter\u2019s death.\nBy the terms of para. 11 of his will, the late Mr. Fleury gave, devised and bequeathed all the rest, residue and remainder of his estate unto his trustees, upon and subject to the following trusts:\n(a) To pay the net income to my daughter, MARGUERITE W. FLEURY, during the remainder of her life, such payments to be made in half-yearly payments or oftener as my Trustees may deem advisable. Should such income payable under this clause in any year amount to less than Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) my Trustees shall pay out of the residue of my estate to my said Daughter the difference between the amount of the said income and Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) it being my intention that my said Daughter shall receive not less than Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) each year. Should the amount so to be paid to my Daughter be in the absolute discretion of my Trustees insufficient for the proper support and maintenance of my said Daughter, my Trustees are hereby authorized to pay to or for my said Daughter such part of the corpus of the said residue of my estate as they shall deem necessary or advisable. In exercising their discretion under this clause, it is my desire that my Trustees shall deal with my said Daughter generously.\n(b) I GIVE AND BEQUEATH the following Charitable bequests:\n(It is unnecessary to set out these bequests).\n(c) Upon the decease of my daughter Marguerite W. Fleury to distribute the corpus of my estate as follows:\nThe sum of Eighty Thousand Dollars ($80,000.00) shall be divided amongst, between or to the first cousins of my said daughter, being Nephews and Nieces of mine, or their children, per stirpes in being at the decease of my daughter.\nThe remainder of the corpus of my estate to be divided as follows:\u2014One-half to my brother William J. Fleury or his heirs; and the remaining one-half to such persons as will be entitled thereto according to the Statute of Distribution in force in the Province of Ontario as if I had died intestate in respect thereto.\nThe question to be determined on this appeal is whether \u201cthe remaining one-half\u201d of the corpus of the estate, consisting of securities having a par value of $338,000 is to be paid to the person or persons who would have been entitled according to The Devolution of Estates Act at the time of the testator\u2019s death, or to those who were so entitled at the date of the death of his daughter Marguerite W. Fleury. The learned judge of first instance, Mr. Justice Hughes, decided that upon the true construction of the will, the testator intended that the fund should go to such persons as would have been entitled at the date of his death if he had died intestate and in so doing he relied upon the rule of construction which was stated by Lord Campbell L.C. in Bullock v. Dowries[19], at p. 12 where he said:\nGenerally speaking, where there is a bequest to one for life, and after his decease to, the testator\u2019s next of kin, the next of kin who are to take are the persons who answer that description at the death of the testator, and not those who answer that description at the death of the first taker. Gifts to a class following a bequest of the same property for life vest immediately upon the death of the testator. Nor does it make any difference that the person to whom such previous life interest was given is also a member of the class to take on his death.\nThe late Marguerite Fleury was the only person entitled under the statute at the date of the testator\u2019s death and the result of applying the rule in Bullock v. Downes, supra, to the language of the present will is that her personal representative becomes entitled to the fund in question.\nIn the reasons for judgment delivered on behalf of the Court of Appeal[20] by Schroeder J.A. he has, however, found that the rule in Bullock v. Downes, supra, does not apply under the present circumstances and that the class of beneficiary is to be determined as at the date of the death of the life tenant so that the nephews and nieces of the testator are entitled to the fund.\nBoth of the judgments in the Courts below contain an extensive review of the authorities and I have now had the benefit of reading the reasons for judgment of my brother Judson who has also made an analysis of many of the cases. I do not think that any useful purpose will be served by my retracing the ground which has been covered so well.\nI think that the true meaning of Bullock v. Downes, supra, is that described by Viscount Finlay in Hutchinson v. National Refuges for Homeless and Destitute Children[21], at p. 801 where he says:\nBullock v. Dowries therefore decides that, prima facie, the next of kin are to be ascertained at the death of the testator, but, that if there is a sufficient indication to that effect in the words of the will, the time for ascertaining the class may be the time fixed by the will as the period of distribution. The question in this as in every other case of the kind must be whether there is in the will a sufficient indication that the period of distribution is the time at which the class is to be ascertained. In the construction of wills; the primary purpose is to determine the intention of the testator and it is only when such intention cannot be arrived at with reasonable certainty by giving the natural and ordinary meaning to the words which he has used that resort is to be had to the rules of construction which have been developed by the Courts in the interpretation of other wills. It is to be remembered that such rules of construction are not rules of law and that if their application results in attributing to the testator an intention which appears inconsistent with the scheme of the will as a whole, then they are not to prevail.\nAn interesting discussion of the scope and purpose of rules of construction in the interpretation of wills is to be found in a note in 4 Law Quarterly Review (which was then under the editorship of Frederick Pollock) where it is said at p. 488:\nA rigid rule of construction is a contradiction in terms. If it does not yield to an evident contrary intention, it is a rule of law not of construction, as Mr. Vaughan Hawkins pointed out many years ago. A rule of construction merely means that the Court has, in a series of cases, attached a particular meaning to a word or collocation of words, and will do so again if there is no reasonable ground for distinguishing the former cases. The Court does so because such meaning is probably the true one\u2026. The difficulty is to give due weight to this probability consistently with a proper regard to the terms of the whole instrument, and to the other evidence (where there is other admissible evidence) of the intention of the settlor or testator.\nAs has been pointed out in the Courts below, Lord Birkenhead L.C. in Lucas-Tooth v. Lucas\u2011Tooth[22], after commenting on Hutchinson\u2019s case, supra, had occasion to say at p. 601:\nIndeed, in approaching a problem of this kind it is important never to lose sight of the true principle of construction in such cases\u2014that it is the duty of the Court to discover the meaning of the words used by the testator, and, from them and from such surrounding circumstances as it is permissible in the particular case to take into account to ascertain his intention. For this purpose, it is important to have regard not only to the whole of the clause which is in question, but to the will as a whole which forms the context to the clause.\nUnless this is done, there is a grave danger that the canons of construction will be applied without due regard to the testator\u2019s intention, tending thereby to ascertain his wishes by rules which, in the particular case, may produce consequences contrary to that intention.\nIn this regard I would adopt the comment of the learned judge of first instance where he says of the cases subsequently decided in Ontario: It seems to me that looking at all the authorities cited to me in the courts of this province since that time and including Re Young the principle of Bullock v. Downes has been applied in the sense stated by Lord Birkenhead, some cases having yielded indications from the wording of the will that the ascertainment of the class should be made with the time of the testator\u2019s death in mind and others with that of the time of distribution and that the former will result in the absence of indications of a contrary intention.\nThe whole scheme of the residuary; clause in the present will appears to me to be predicated on the assumption that the testator\u2019s daughter would survive him and I agree with Schroeder J.A. that he must also be deemed to have known that in that event she would be his only next-of-kin at the date of his death. This being the case, to interpret the terms of para. 11(c) as being a gift of the income from \u201cthe remaining one-half\u201d of the corpus to the daughter for life and after her death of the capital to the next-of-kin of the testator at the date of his death, is to attribute to the testator an intention to give his daughter a vested interest in this fund at his death. It appears to me, however, that such a construction runs contrary to the clear provisions of para. 11(a) of the will whereby the testator expressly directed that this part of his estate was to be incorporated in a trust fund to be held by his trustees with direction to pay his daughter at least $5,000 a year from the income and if necessary from the capital and to the capital of which she could only otherwise have access if the trustees in their absolute discretion considered the sum of $5,000 annually to be insufficient for her proper support and maintenance. In my view this makes it apparent that the testator intended the whole of the corpus of his estate to be preserved intact during the lifetime of his daughter subject to the payments which the trustees were authorized to make. It seems to me that the result of applying the rule in Bullock v. Downes to this will is to ignore the carefully drawn provisions setting up this trust and to attribute to the testator the contrary intention to provide for his daughter in such manner as to enable her to obtain a substantial part of the fund for her own use absolutely without the exercise of any authority or discretion by the trustees and whether or not the whole fund produced an income of $5,000 a year.\nIn my opinion the inconsistency which results from the application of this rule to the language used in paras. 11(a) and 11(c) of the will is of itself a sufficient indication that the testator did not intend the ultimate beneficiaries under para. 11(c) to be those entitled under The Devolution of Estates Act at the date of his death, but rather that he intended one\u2011half of the remainder of the corpus of his estate to be divided amongst the persons so entitled at the date of the death of his daughter. Such a construction does no violence to the language by which the trust fund was created under para. 11(a) and is not inconsistent with the natural and ordinary meaning attributable to the words used in para. 11(c).\nFor these reasons I am of opinion that the class entitled to the remaining one-half of the corpus of the estate is to be ascertained at the time of the death of Marguerite Fleury. I would therefore dismiss this appeal.\nThe costs of all parties throughout will be paid out of the estate.

The Court of Appeal affirmed the finding that the respondent was an habitual criminal, but set aside the sentence of preventive detention and restored the sentence of one year imposed upon him by the Magistrate. The Crown was granted leave to appeal to this Court. The only question raised was whether a sentence of preventive detention should be imposed. At the hearing of the appeal the question of the jurisdiction of this Court was raised for the first time from the Bench. The contention of the Crown was that there was an appeal to this Court under the provisions of s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act.\nHeld (Taschereau C.J. and Martland J. dissenting): The appeal should be quashed.\nPer Cartwright J.: Since the decisions of this Court in Brusch v. The Queen, [1953] 1 S.C.R. 373 and Parkes v. The Queen [1956] S.C.R. 134, it could not be said that any right of appeal to this Court was conferred by the Criminal Code. An order made under Part XXI of the Code is neither a conviction nor an acquittal of an indictable offence. If the Crown has a right of appeal it must be found in s. 41(1) of the Supreme Court Act. However, the power to grant the right of appeal sought by the Crown in this case is not conferred by the general words of s. 41(1) although on their literal meaning they would appear wide enough to comprehend it. The construction of s. 41(1), for which the Crown contends in this case would result in an incongruity. The case of The King v. Robinson (or Robertson), [1951] S.C.R. 522, could not now be regarded as an authority for the existence of jurisdiction in this Court to entertain an appeal by the Crown from a judgment of a Court of Appeal setting aside a sentence of preventive detention.\nPer Abbott, Judson, Ritchie and Hall JJ.: This Court was without jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. Neither the Crown nor the accused is given any right under the Criminal Code to appeal to this Court from the disposition made of an application for preventive detention by the Court of Appeal of a province. The sentence of preventive detention could only have been imposed on a man who had been found to have the status of an habitual criminal, but it was the conviction of an indictable offence which afforded the occasion for its imposition and as this appeal is from the sentence\u2014the finding as to status not being an issue\u2014it is governed by the decision of this Court in Goldhar v. The Queen, [1960] S.C.R. 60, where it was held that this Court has not jurisdiction to entertain an appeal against sentence. Parliament could not have intended the anomaly which would result from the provisions of s. 667(2) of the Criminal Code and s. 41(1) of the Supreme Court Act, if there was an appeal to this Court at the instance of the Crown from an order of the Court of Appeal setting aside a sentence of preventive detention.\nPer Taschereau C.J. and Martland J., dissenting: It is clear that no appeal lies to this Court from a sentence imposed under s. 660 of the Criminal Code by virtue of the provisions of the Criminal Code governing appeals in respect of indictable offences, for such appeals are limited to judgments respecting convictions or acquittal of an indictable offence. However, all the necessary elements of s. 41(1) of the Supreme Court Act are met in this case. The decisions in Goldhar v. The Queen, supra, and in The Queen v. Alepin Fr\u00e8res Lt\u00e9e, [1965] S.C.R. 359, do not preclude an appeal in the present case. A sentence under s. 660 is not imposed as a punishment for the indictable offence, but is imposed because the accused is an habitual criminal and it is expedient that the public be protected from him. The contention that, while an appeal to this Court might lie in relation to the finding that the accused is an habitual criminal, it could not lie in respect of the question as to whether it was expedient for the protection of the public that he be sentenced, could not be supported. There is no incongruity in permitting an appeal by the Crown in this case. Section 41(1) of the Supreme Court Act was a means provided by Parliament to enable this Court to deal with a situation such as the one in this case. There is no valid reason for reading into s. 41(1) of the Supreme Court Act a limitation as to an appeal by the Crown when a right of appeal by the accused is well recognized. Leave having been granted, this Court did have jurisdiction to entertain the present appeal.\nAs to the merits, the Court of Appeal erred when it ruled that it could not impose a preventive sentence unless there was evidence on which a magistrate could find beyond a reasonable doubt that it was expedient for the protection of the public to so sentence the accused. A standard which is applied in weighing proof of the guilt of the accused has no application to the formulation of an opinion as to what is expedient to protect the public.\nDroit criminel\u2014Appels\u2014Juridiction\u2014D\u00e9claration que l'accus\u00e9 est un repris de justice confirm\u00e9e par la Cour d'Appel, mais sentence de d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive mise de c\u00f4te\u2014La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a-t-elle juridiction pour entendre l'appel de la Couronne\u2014Code criminel, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, art. 667\u2014Loi sur la Cour supr\u00eame, S.R.C. 1952, c. 259, art. 41.\nAyant \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9 coupable de vol, l'intim\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 subs\u00e9quemment reconnu repris de justice et une sentence de d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive lui fut impos\u00e9e au lieu de la sentence qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9e pour l'infraction dont il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 coupable.

La sentence de d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive ne peut \u00eatre impos\u00e9e qu'\u00e0 une personne dont la statut a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00eatre celui d'un repris de justice, mais c'est la d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 d'un acte criminel qui donne ouverture \u00e0 l'imposition de cette sentence, et comme cet appel est de la sentence\u2014la d\u00e9claration relativement au statut n'\u00e9tant pas en litige\u2014l'appel est gouvern\u00e9 par la d\u00e9cision de cette Cour dans Goldhar v. The Queen, [1960] R.C.S. 60, o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 que cette Cour n'avait pas juridiction d'entendre un appel de la sentence. Le parlement n'a pas pu avoir eu l'intention de cr\u00e9er l'anomalie qui r\u00e9sulterait des dispositions de l'art. 667(2) du Code criminel et de l'art. 41(1) de la Loi sur la Cour supr\u00eame, s'il existait un appel devant cette Cour de la part de la Couronne d'une ordonnance de la Cour d'Appel mettant de c\u00f4t\u00e9 une sentence de d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive.\nLe Juge en Chef Taschereau et le Juge Martland, dissidents: Il n'existe aucun appel devant cette Cour d'une sentence impos\u00e9e en vertu de l'art. 660 du Code criminel en vertu des dispositions du Code criminel gouvernant les appels relativement aux actes criminels, de tels appels \u00e9tant limit\u00e9s aux jugements relativement \u00e0 une d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 ou un acquittement d'un acte criminel. Cependant, tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments n\u00e9cessaires de l'art. 41(1) de la Loi sur la Cour supr\u00eame se rencontrent dans cette cause. Les d\u00e9cisions de Goldhar v. The Queen, supra, et de The Queen v. Alepin Fr\u00e8res Lt\u00e9e, [1965] R.C.S. 359, n'emp\u00eachent pas un appel dans cette cause. Une sentence en vertu de l'art. 660 n'est pas impos\u00e9e comme punition pour un acte criminel, mais est impos\u00e9e parce que l'accus\u00e9 est un repris de justice et qu'il est opportun que le public soit prot\u00e9g\u00e9 contre lui. La pr\u00e9tention \u00e0 l'effet que, quoiqu'un appel puisse exister relativement \u00e0 une d\u00e9claration que l'accus\u00e9 est un repris de justice, un appel ne peut exister relativement \u00e0 la question de savoir s'il est opportun pour la protection du public qu'une sentence soit impos\u00e9e, ne peut pas \u00eatre support\u00e9e. Il n'y a aucune incongruit\u00e9 de permettre un appel par la Couronne dans cette cause. L'art. 41(1) de la Loi sur la Cour supr\u00eame est un moyen pr\u00e9vu par le parlement pour permettre \u00e0 cette Cour de disposer d'une situation telle que celle qui se pr\u00e9sente dans cette cause. Il n'y a en cons\u00e9quence aucune raison valide pour voir dans l'art. 41(1) de la Loi sur la Cour supr\u00eame une restriction quant \u00e0 un appel par la Couronne lorsqu'un droit d'appel par l'accus\u00e9 est reconnu. Permission d'appeler ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e, cette Cour avait juridiction d'entendre l'appel. Quant aux m\u00e9rites, la Cour d'Appel a err\u00e9 quand elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'elle ne pouvait imposer une sentence pr\u00e9ventive \u00e0 moins qu'elle ne trouve une preuve sur laquelle un magistrat pourrait d\u00e9clarer hors de tout doute raisonnable qu'il \u00e9tait opportun pour la protection du public que l'accus\u00e9 re\u00e7oive une telle sentence. On ne peut se servir pour formuler une opinion relativement \u00e0 l'opportunit\u00e9 de prot\u00e9ger le public d'une norme dont on se sert pour \u00e9valuer la preuve relativement \u00e0 la culpabilit\u00e9 de l'accus\u00e9.\nAPPEL d'un jugement de la Cour d'Appel de la Colombie-Britannique, mettant de c\u00f4t\u00e9 une sentence de d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive.

Appeal quashed, Taschereau C.J. and Martland J. dissenting.\nW. G. Burke-Robertson, Q.C., for the appellant.\nAngus Carmichael, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Taschereau C.J. and of Martland J. was delivered by\nMARTLAND J. (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal, brought by the Crown, pursuant to leave granted by this Court, from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, which reversed the decision of a magistrate, who had imposed a sentence of preventive detention on the respondent pursuant to s. 660 of the Criminal Code, which provides:\n660. (1) Where an accused has been convicted of an indictable offence the court may, upon application, impose a sentence of preventive detention in lieu of any other sentence that might be imposed for the offence of which he was convicted or that was imposed for such offence, or in addition to any sentence that was imposed for such offence if the sentence has expired, if\n(a) the accused is found to be an habitual criminal, and\n(b) the court is of the opinion that because the accused is an habitual criminal, it is expedient for the protection of the public to sentence him to preventive detention.\n(2) For the purposes of subsection (1), an accused is an habitual criminal if\n(a) he has previously, since attaining the age of eighteen years, on at least three separate and independent occasions been convicted of an indictable offence for which he was liable to imprisonment for five years or more and is leading persistently a criminal life, or\n(b) he has been previously sentenced to preventive detention. (3) At the hearing of an application under subsection (1), the accused is entitled to be present.\nThis section deals exclusively with the matter of sentence, as is made clear by the opening words of s. 667(1), which deals with the right of appeal of the accused:\nA person who is sentenced to preventive detention under this Part may appeal to the court of appeal. \u2026\nBefore a sentence of preventive detention can be imposed the court must reach a decision on two matters, defined in paras. (a) and (b) of subs. (1); i.e.,\n(a) That the accused is an habitual criminal; and\n(b) That because of that fact, it is expedient for the protection of the public that he should be sentenced to preventive detention.\nA decision in favour of the accused on each of these matters was the basis of the dissenting judgment of MacQuarrie J., in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, in Mulcahy v. The Queen[1] , which was adopted by this Court[2] when the appeal of the accused was allowed.\nThese matters are, I think, of importance in considering the first issue raised by the respondent as to the jurisdiction of this Court to hear this appeal.\nIt is clear that no appeal lies to this Court from a sentence imposed under s. 660 by virtue of the provisions of the Criminal Code governing appeals in respect of indictable offences, for such appeals are limited to judgments respecting conviction or acquittal of an indictable offence.\nAppeals to this Court, in respect of a sentence under s. 660, have been brought, with leave pursuant to s. 41(1) of the Supreme Court Act, which provides:\n41. (1) Subject to subsection (3), an appeal lies to the Supreme Court with leave of that Court from any final or other judgment of the highest court of final resort in a province, or a judge thereof, in which judgment can be had in the particular case sought to be appealed to the Supreme Court, whether or not leave to appeal to the Supreme Court has been refused by any other court.\nAs my brother Cartwright points out, in the present case, all of the necessary elements of that subsection are here met. The judgment of the Court of Appeal is a final judgment, and it is the judgment of the highest court of final resort in which judgment could be had in this case. This being so, on what basis can it be contended that this Court lacks jurisdiction? In my opinion the decisions in Goldhar v. The Queen[3] and in The Queen[4] v. Alepin Fr\u00e8res Lt\u00e9e and Cl\u00e9ment Alepin[5] do not preclude an appeal in the present case. Each case was concerned solely with the matter of sentence in respect of an offence imposed in consequence of a conviction of such offence. A sentence under s. 660, while it is made following conviction of an indictable offence, is not imposed as a punishment for that offence, but is imposed because the accused is an habitual criminal and it is expedient that the public be protected from him. In Parkes v. The Queen[6] , Cartwright J., who delivered the judgment of the Court, said, at p. 135:\nIt appears to me that the majority of this Court decided in Brusch v. The Queen, (1953) 1 S.C.R. 373, that the \"charge\" of being an habitual criminal is not a charge of an offence or crime but is merely an assertion of the existence of a status or condition in the accused which, if established, enables the Court to deal with the accused in a certain manner. In so deciding the majority followed the reasoning of the English courts in Rex v. Hunter, (1921) 1 K.B. 555, approved by a court of thirteen judges precided over by Lord Hewart L.C.J. in Rex v. Norman, (1924) 18 Cr. App. R. 81.\nIt is, therefore, established that a sentence under s. 660 is not one which is imposed in relation to a charge of an offence or crime, but is a disposition which may be made by the court, if it is expedient for the protection of the public, with relation to a person in a particular status or condition.\nAppeals from a sentence under s. 660 have been determined in this Court on a number of occasions, one of the most recent being the Mulcahy case previously mentioned, in which Chief Justice Taschereau commenced his judgment with the words: \"We are all of the opinion that the appeal against sentence of preventive detention should be allowed \u2026\"\nIt is contended that, while an appeal to this Court might lie in relation to the finding of the accused to be an habitual criminal, it could not lie in respect of the question as to whether it was expedient for the protection of the public that he be sentenced. If a finding as to the status of the accused, on the first point, is not a judgment acquitting or convicting or setting aside or affirming a conviction or acquittal of an indictable offence, within s. 41(3) of the Supreme Court Act, as was held in the Parkes case, I find it hard to understand how the decision on the second point as to expedience can fall within it. Furthermore, I do not agree that the appeal to this Court respecting matters under s. 660 can be arbitrarily divided in respect of the two items under paras. (a) and (b) of subs. (1). Any appeal in relation to s. 660 is an appeal from sentence, but it is not within s. 41(3) of the Supreme Court Act because, as was said in Parkes, it does not relate to conviction or acquittal of an indictable offence, but to a method of dealing with people of a particular status.\nAnother ground for contending that no appeal lies in the present case is because this appeal is by the Crown, and the Crown is limited, in respect of its right of appeal to the court of appeal, to matters of law, and consequently the general words of s. 41(1) of the Supreme Court Act should be narrowed in respect of the nature of this subject-matter. It is said that it would be incongruous to permit an open appeal by the Crown to this Court, when it has only a limited right in the court below.\nThe Crown's right to appeal to the court of appeal, while limited to a question of law, is absolute, whereas there is no appeal to this Court under s. 41(1) without leave.\nThe limitation upon the position of the Crown in the court of appeal is only in those cases in which the accused has succeeded in the court of first instance. In a case of that kind, if the Crown's appeal to the court of appeal failed, it is clear that, if it were to obtain leave to appeal to this Court, its appeal, of necessity, could only lie in relation to the question of law which had been determined adversely to it in the court of appeal. Under s. 46 of the Supreme Court Act, this Court could only dismiss the appeal or give the judgment which should have been given in the court below, i.e., on a question of law.\nIn the case of an appeal to the court of appeal by an accused who has been sentenced under s. 660, it would be open to the Crown to raise any ground for contending that the initial decision should be maintained, and in respect of that kind of an appeal the position of the Crown is unrestricted. That being so, I do not find it incongruous that it should be entitled to seek leave to appeal to this Court on any ground taken by it before the court of appeal.\nIn the present case, the ground for seeking leave was solely with respect to an important question of law on which it was contended that the Court of Appeal had erred. If the Crown can appeal on a matter of law to the Court of Appeal, and if the accused can seek leave to appeal to this Court upon any ground, I see no basis for limiting the words of s. 41(1) of the Supreme Court Act so as to preclude any right of appeal by the Crown to this Court, upon a question of law. To deny such a right is to make it possible for differing applications of s. 660 in different provinces, with no power in this Court to determine the matter. Section 41(1) was a means provided by Parliament to enable this Court to deal with a situation of that kind.\nI can, therefore, see no valid reason for reading into s. 41(1) of the Supreme Court Act a limitation as to an appeal by the Crown when a right of appeal to this Court by the accused is well recognized.\nI am, therefore, of the opinion that this Court does have jurisdiction to entertain the present appeal, leave having been granted.\nThe decision of the Court of Appeal, that, although the respondent was an habitual criminal, yet it was not expedient for the protection of the public to sentence him to preventive detention, was stated to be based on the proposition that a court, under s. 660, cannot impose that sentence unless there is evidence \"on which a magistrate could find beyond a reasonable doubt that it was expedient for the protection of the public to sentence him to preventive detention.\"\nProof beyond reasonable doubt is the well-recognized standard applied in the criminal law in respect of the establishing of the guilt of an accused person. In my opinion it has no application to the matter of the imposition of sentence. A court, under s. 660, having determined that an accused person is an habitual criminal, is required to exercise its judgment as to whether it is expedient for the protection of the public to impose a sentence of preventive detention. Section 660(1) (b) states specifically that this is a matter of opinion. That opinion must be as to expediency for public protection. In my view, a standard which is applied in weighing proof of a fact, i.e., guilt of the accused, has no application to the formulation of an opinion as to what is expedient to protect the public.\nI would allow the appeal and restore the judgment of the magistrate.\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014An account of the proceedings in the courts below is given in the reasons of my brother Ritchie.\nOn March 15, 1965, an order was made by this Court the operative part of which reads as follows:\nTHIS COURT DID ORDER AND ADJUDGE that leave to appeal from the Judgment of the Court of Appeal for the Province of British Columbia pronounced on the 24th day of February, 1965 be and the same is granted.\nNo question as to the jurisdiction of this Court was raised or considered when this order granting leave was made. The question of our jurisdiction was raised for the first time from the bench during the argument of the appeal.\nIt is well settled that a person who has been sentenced to preventive detention and whose appeal against that sentence has been dismissed by the Court of Appeal may be granted leave to appeal to this Court under s. 41(1) of the Supreme Court Act. On this point it is sufficient to refer to the unanimous judgment of the Court in Parkes v. The Queen[7] . As is pointed out by my brother Ritchie, a number of such appeals have been allowed by this Court.\nAs far as I am aware, subject to something to be said later as to Robinson's case, infra, the question whether this Court has jurisdiction to grant leave to the Attorney General to appeal to this Court against the dismissal of an application for an order that a person be sentenced to preventive detention has not previously been considered by this Court. The answer to this question depends upon the proper construction of the relevant statutory provisions.\nLittle assistance is to be found in the comparatively short history of the legislation in this country relating to preventive detention. The predecessors of the group of sections which now form Part XXI of the Criminal Code were first enacted by Statutes of Canada, 1947, 11 Geo. VI, c. 55 and were numbered 575A to 575H. Section 575E corresponded to the present s. 667, which is set out in full in the reasons of my brother Ritchie. It was silent as to any right of the Attorney General to appeal. It read as follows:\n575E. A person convicted and sentenced to preventive detention, may appeal against his conviction and sentence, and the provisions of this Act relating to an appeal from a conviction for an indictable offence shall be applicable thereto.\nThe first alteration in the provisions as to appeal was made when the present Criminal Code, 2-3 Eliz. II, c. 51, came into force on April 1, 1955, at which time s. 667 read as follows:\n667(1) A person who is sentenced to preventive detention under this Part may appeal to the Court of Appeal against the sentence.\n(2) The Attorney General may appeal to the court of appeal against the dismissal of an application for an order under this Part.\n(3) The provisions of Part XVIII with respect to procedure on appeals apply, mutatis mutandis, to appeals under this section.\nSection 667, in its present form was enacted by Statutes of Canada, 1960-61, 9-10 Eliz. II, c. 43, s. 40.\nIt is clear that the provisions quoted above deal only with the right of appeal to the Court of Appeal from a decision of the tribunal of first instance. It cannot be said that sub-section (3) of s. 667, providing that \"the provisions of Part XVIII with respect to procedure on appeals apply, mutatis mutandis to appeals under this section\", has the effect of conferring jurisdiction on this Court. Part XVIII deals only with appeals in regard to convictions or acquittals of indictable offences.\nSince the decisions of this Court in Brusch v. The Queen[8] and Parkes v. The Queen[9] , it cannot be said that any right of appeal to this Court is conferred by the Criminal Code. An order made under Part XXI is neither a conviction nor an acquittal of an indictable offence. If the Attorney General has a right of appeal to this Court it must be found in s. 41(1) of the Supreme Court Act. It is clear that if on its true construction subs. (1) confers the right of appeal which the Attorney General seeks to assert that right is not taken away by the terms of subs. (3) for we are not here concerned with the judgment of any court acquitting or convicting or setting aside or affirming a conviction or acquittal of an indictable offence or of any offence.\nSection 41(1) reads a follows:\n41(1) Subject to subsection (3), an appeal lies to the Supreme Court with leave of that Court from any final or other judgment of the highest court of final resort in a province, or a judge thereof, in which judgment can be had in the particular case sought to be appealed to the Supreme Court, whether or not leave to appeal to the Supreme Court has been refused by any other court.\nApplying these words to the circumstances of the case before us it appears: (i) that the judgment from which the Attorney General appeals is a final judgment, it finally determines that the sentence of preventive detention imposed upon the respondent by the learned Magistrate is set aside; and (ii) that it is a judgment of the highest court of final resort in the Province of British Columbia in which judgment can be had in this particular case. That being so, the application for leave to appeal made by the Attorney General would appear to be warranted by the literal meaning of the words of the sub-section and prima facie this Court would seem to have jurisdiction to entertain the appeal unless it appears by the application of the rules which guide the Court in the interpretation of statutes that Parliament did not intend to confer a right of appeal from a judgment such as that pronounced by the Court of Appeal in this case.\nThe words of s. 41(1) are general and it is necessary to consider the possible application of the rule expressed in the maxim \"Verba generalia restringuntur ad habilitatem rei vel personae\" (Bac. Max. reg. 10) Broom's Legal Maxims, 10th ed. 438. The maxim was applied in Cox v. Hakes[10] . It was held in that case by the House of Lords that the following words in s. 19 of the Judicature Act, 36 and 37 Vict., c. 66:\n19. The said Court of Appeal shall have jurisdiction and power to hear and determine appeals from any judgment or order \u2026of Her Majesty's High Court of Justice, or of any Judges or Judge thereof did not confer a right of appeal from an order of the High Court directing the discharge of a prisoner on habeas corpus, although as was said by Lord Herschell at page 428:\nIt cannot be denied that an order for the discharge of a person in custody, such as was made in the present case, is, prima facie, an order to which this section applies.\nLord Bramwell, at page 527, concluded his speech with the following sentence:\nI think if an order of discharge is a judgment or order of judicature, and so within the very words of section 19, a limitation must be put upon them to avoid futility, inconvenience, and incongruity which would otherwise result.\nThe construction of s. 41(1), for which the Attorney General contends in the case at bar would result in an incongruity pointed out in the reasons of my brother Ritchie to which further reference will be made.\nI am able to derive little assistance in the solution of the question before us from the judgments of this Court in Goldhar v. The Queen[11] or in The Queen v. Alepin Fr\u00e8res Lt\u00e9e and Cl\u00e9ment Alepin[12] . They establish only that this Court is without jurisdiction to entertain an appeal, even on a question of law in the strict sense, against a judgment of the Court of Appeal affirming or quashing a sentence imposed following conviction of an indictable offence or of an offence other than an indictable offence; and it is well settled that this Court has jurisdiction to entertain an appeal against the imposition of a sentence of preventive detention. There is something to be said for the view that the Court should have a corresponding jurisdiction to entertain an appeal against an order dismissing an application for the imposition of such a sentence, but in dealing with a similar argument in Cox v. Hakes, supra, Lord Herschell said at pages 535 and 536:\nIt will be seen that the reasoning which has led me to the conclusion that an appeal will not lie from an order discharging a person from custody under a writ of habeas corpus has no application to an appeal from an order refusing to discharge the applicant. I intend to express no opinion whether there is an appeal in such a case. That question does not arise here, and any opinion expressed upon it would be extra-judicial. I refer to it only because it was suggested that if there was an appeal in the one case, it was scarcely to be conceived that there should not be an appeal in the other. I do not think so. There would be to my mind nothing surprising if it should turn out that an appeal lay by one whose discharge had been refused, but that there was no appeal against a discharge from custody. It would be in strict analogy to that which has long been the law. The discharge could never be reviewed or interfered with; the refusal to discharge, on the other hand, was always open to review; and although this review was not properly speaking, by way of appeal its practical effect was precisely the same as if it had been.\nMy brother Ritchie points out that if we should uphold the Attorney General's right of appeal in this case it would have the anomalous result which he describes as follows:\nIt would mean that although the Crown is restricted to \"any ground of law\" when appealing to the Court of Appeal of a province against the dismissal of an application for preventive detention by a trial judge, it can obtain access to this Court on unrestricted grounds when appealing from a judgment of the Court of Appeal which has the same effect.\nThe unlikelihood of Parliament intending such a result appears to me to be a sufficient reason for applying the maxim quoted above and holding that power to grant the right of appeal sought by the Attorney General in this case is not conferred by the general words of s. 41(1) although on their literal meaning they would appear wide enough to comprehend it.\nBefore parting with the matter I wish to refer to the case of The King v. Robinson (or Robertson)[13] , which, on its face, appears inconsistent with the conclusion at which I have arrived. The respondent in that case was found to be a habitual criminal and was sentenced by Whittaker J. to preventive detention. On appeal to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[14] the sentence of preventive detention was set aside. The Attorney General applied to a single judge of this Court under s. 1025 of the Criminal Code then in force for leave to appeal on a question of law. Leave was granted and the full Court allowed the appeal, set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal and referred the matter back to that Court to deal with other grounds which had been raised in the notice of appeal but which the Court had found it unnecessary to consider in view of its decision on the point of law. I was a member of the Court which heard the appeal and took part in the judgment allowing the appeal of the Attorney General. I have confirmed my recollection by examining the record and consulting the Judge who gave leave and it is clear that our jurisdiction was not questioned at any stage of the proceedings in this Court. The Court and all counsel concerned appear to have proceeded on the view that an appeal to this Court lay as if the finding that the respondent was a habitual criminal was tantamount to his conviction of an indictable offence. This view may have been induced by the following expressions found in the sections then in force which no longer appear in Part XXI: in s. 575 C(3) \"unless he thereafter pleads guilty to being a habitual criminal\"; in s. 575 C.(4) \"A person shall not be tried on a charge of being a habitual criminal unless\"; in s. 575 E, \"a person convicted and sentenced to preventive detention, may appeal against his conviction and sentence, and the provisions of this Act relating to an appeal from a conviction for an indictable offence shall be applicable thereto\"; and in s. 575 G(1) \"The sentence of preventive detention shall take effect immediately on the conviction of a person on a charge that he is a habitual criminal\".\nIt is, I think, a tenable view that under the wording of the relevant sections then in force the procedure followed in Robinson's case was correct. The question of a right of appeal to this Court was not discussed in Brusch v. The Queen, supra, and by the time Parkes v. The Queen, supra, was decided Part XXI had been enacted in substantially its present form. In view of the changes in wording made when the new Code came into force and the decision of this Court in Parkes v. The Queen, supra, it is my opinion that Robinson's case cannot now be regarded as an authority for the existence of jurisdiction in this Court to entertain an appeal by the Attorney General from a judgment of a Court of Appeal setting aside a sentence of preventive detention.\nI would dispose of the appeal as proposed by my brother Ritchie.\nThe judgment of Abbott, Judson, Ritchie and Hall JJ. was delivered by RITCHIE J.:\u2014This is an appeal brought at the instance of Attorney General of British Columbia and with leave of this Court from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia. The order for judgment of that court reads, in part, as follows:\nTHIS COURT DOTH ORDER AND ADJUDGE that the Appeal of the above-named Appellant from the finding that the Appellant is an habitual criminal be and the same is hereby dismissed, the Appeal of the above-named Appellant from the sentence of preventive detention imposed on him be and the same is hereby allowed, the sentence of preventive detention imposed on him as aforesaid be and the same is hereby set aside, and pursuant to section 667 of the Criminal Code, a sentence of imprisonment in Oakalla Prison Farm, Burnaby, British Columbia, for a term of one year be and the same is hereby imposed in respect of the said conviction by Magistrate L. H. Jackson entered on the 20th day of May 1964 on the above-described charge, such sentence to run from the 20th day of May, 1964.\nNo appeal has been asserted from the finding that the respondent, Robert MacDonald is an habitual criminal and the Crown seeks to confine its appeal to that part of the judgment which allowed the appellant's appeal from the sentence of preventive detention imposed on him by Magistrate Cyril White of Vancouver on December 29, 1964.\nRobert MacDonald was tried and convicted before Magistrate Jackson on the charge that he \"unlawfully did commit theft of one case containing 50 cartons of DuMaurier cigarettes of a value in excess of $50.00 \u2026\" and for this crime he was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of one year. Having regard to the respondent's past criminal record, an application was made with the consent of the Attorney General of British Columbia for the imposition of a sentence of preventive detention in lieu of the sentence imposed upon him by Magistrate Jackson.\nApplications for preventive detention are governed by s. 660 of the Criminal Code which reads as follow:\n660. (1) Where an accused has been convicted of an indictable offence the court may, upon application, impose a sentence of preventive detention in lieu of any other sentence that might be imposed for the offence of which he was convicted or that was imposed for such offence, or in addition to any sentence that was imposed for such offence if the sentence has expired, if\n(a) The accused is found to be an habitual criminal, and (b) the court is of the opinion that because the accused is an habitual criminal, it is expedient for the protection of the public to sentence him to preventive detention.\n(2) For the purposes of subsection (1), an accused is an habitual criminal if\n(a) he has previously, since attaining the age of eighteen years, on at least three separate and independent occasions been convicted of an indictable offence for which he was liable to imprisonment for five years or more and is leading persistently a criminal life, or\n(b) he has been previously sentenced to preventive detention.\n(3) At the hearing of an application under subsection (1), the accused is entitled to be present.\nIt is to be observed that the finding that an accused is an habitual criminal is a necessary prerequisite to the imposition of a sentence of preventive detention but that it does not result in the imposition of such a sentence unless the court is of opinion that it is expedient for the protection of the public that it should be imposed. As has been indicated, the only question raised on this appeal is whether a sentence of preventive detention should have been imposed in the present case.\nThe only provision in the Criminal Code for an appeal from the disposition of an application made under s. 660 is contained in s. 667 and it was pursuant to the provisions of this section that the respondent appealed to the Court of Appeal of British Columbia. This section reads as follows:\n667.(1) A person who is sentenced to preventive detention under this Part may appeal to the court of appeal against that sentence on any ground of law or fact or mixed law and fact.\n(2) The Attorney General may appeal to the court of appeal against the dismissal of an application for an order under this Part on any ground of law.\n(2a) On an appeal against a sentence of preventive detention the court of appeal may\n(a) quash such sentence and impose any sentence that might have been imposed in respect of the offence for which the appellant was convicted, or\n(b) dismiss the appeal.\n(2b) On an appeal against the dismissal of an application for an order under this Part the court of appeal may\n(a) allow the appeal, set aside any sentence imposed in respect of the offence for which the respondent was convicted and impose a sentence of preventive detention, or\n(b) dismiss the appeal. (2c) A judgment of the court of appeal imposing a sentence pursuant to this section has the same force and effect as if it were a sentence passed by the trial court.\n(3) The provisions of Part XVIII with respect to procedure on appeals apply, mutatis mutandis, to appeals under this section.\nUnder this section the right of the Attorney General to appeal against the dismissal of an applicaiton for preventive detention is strictly limited to \"any ground of law\" and it is to be observed also that neither the Crown nor the accused is given any right under the Criminal Code to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada from the disposition made of such an application by the Court of Appeal of a province. It is contended, however, on behalf of the Attorney General of British Columbia that an appeal lies to this Court under the provisions of s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act which reads, in part, a follows:\n41(1) Subject to subsection (3), an appeal lies to the Supreme Court with leave of that Court from any final or other judgment of the highest court of final resort in a province, or a judge thereof, in which judgment can be had in the particular case sought to be appealed to the Supreme Court, whether or not leave to appeal to the Supreme Court has been refused by any other court.\n***\n(3) No appeal to the Supreme Court lies under this section from the judgment of any court acquitting or convicting or setting aside or affirming a conviction or acquittal of an indictable offence or, except in respect of a question of law or jurisdiction, of an offence other than an indictable offence.\nCounsel for the appellant concedes that it has been decided in the case of Goldhar v. The Queen[15] that criminal offences and sentences imposed therefor are excluded from the operation of s. 41(1) by the terms of s. 41(3), but he contends that a sentence of preventive detention is imposed as a result of a finding that the accused has the status of an habitual criminal which this Court has held not to be a criminal offence (see Brusch v. The Queen[16] ). It is therefore argued that the judgment of the Court of Appeal setting aside the sentence of preventive detention is unaffected by s. 41(3) and is a judgment of the highest court of final resort in a province determining the rights of an individual and accordingly a proper subject for appeal under section 41(1).\nThere have been a number of cases in this Court in which leave to appeal has been granted pursuant to s. 41(1) from the granting of an application for the imposition of a sentence of preventive detention under s. 660, but each of these cases involved an appeal from the finding that the person seeking leave to appeal was an habitual criminal, and that finding was in each instance set aside with the result that the sentence of preventive detention for which it was a prerequisite was also set aside. As has been indicated, it is upon the ground that the finding that a man is an habitual criminal is a determination of status and not a conviction of a criminal offence that leave to appeal has been granted in the past and counsel were unable to cite any case except the present one in which the finding of status was not in issue and the entire appeal has been limited to the question of sentence.\nReference was made to the case of Mulcahy v. The Queen[17] where the judgment of this Court is reported as follows:\nWe are all of opinion that the appeal against the sentence of preventive detention should be allowed for the reasons given by MacQuarrie J. and that the record should be returned to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco to impose a sentence for the substantive offence of which the appellant was convicted.\nIt must be noted, however, that in that case MacQuarrie J. had concluded his reasons for judgment by saying:\nI would allow the appeal, quash the finding that the appellant was an habitual criminal and the sentence that he be held in preventive detention, and impose a sentence of three years in Dorchester Penitentiary for the substantive offence\".\nThe italics are my own.\nIt is true that the finding of the appellant's status in the present case was not a conviction of a criminal offence, but the sentence of preventive detention imposed by Magistrate White was \"in lieu of the sentence of one year imposed earlier upon the said Robert Cecil MacDonald \u2026\" upon his conviction for an indictable offence. The sentence of preventive detention could only have been imposed on a man who had been found to have the status of an habitual criminal, but it was the conviction of an indictable offence which afforded the occasion for its imposition and as this appeal is from the sentence and the finding as to status is not an issue, it is, in my opinion, governed by the decision of this Court in Goldhar v. The Queen, supra.\nThe effect of the Goldhar case is summarized in the judgment of Taschereau J., as he then was, in Paul v. The Queen[18] , where he says at 457 speaking of s. 41(3):\nIn matters of indictable offences, it confers no jurisdiction on this Court, and we must find in the Criminal Code the rules that govern such appeals. In summary matters, on the other hand, jurisdiction to appeal to this Court is given in s. 41(3). It was held in Goldhar v. The Queen that if an appeal from a sentence was not given by 41(3), nor the Criminal Code, we could not find any authority in 41(1) to review a sentence imposed by the Courts below. In that case it was stated by Fauteux J. with whom all the members of the Court agreed, Cartwright J. dissenting, that in order to determine if a convicted person could appeal against a sentence in a matter of indictable offence, it was not permissible to look to s. 41(1) for the authority to intervene, but only in the Criminal Code which does not permit an appeal against a sentence.\nIn the recent case of Her Majesty the Queen v. J. Alepin Fr\u00e8res Lt\u00e9\u00e9 and Cl\u00e9ment Alepin[19] , the Crown sought to appeal the quashing of a sentence by the court below on jurisdictional grounds and Fauteux J., speaking on behalf of the Court, had occasion to comment on the effect of s. 41(1) and 41(3) of the Supreme Court Act, saying:\nIt is clear from the terms of subsection (3) that, unless the judgment sought to be appealed is a judgment \"acquitting or convicting or setting aside or affirming a conviction or acquittal\" of either an indictable offence or an offence other than an indictable offence, there is no jurisdiction in this Court under that subsection to entertain this appeal. The judgment here sought to be appealed does not come within that description. It is not a judgment related to an acquittal or a conviction of an offence and, while an important question of jurisdiction is involved therein, this question does not relate to an acquittal or a conviction within the meaning of subsection (3) but to sentence. Neither can jurisdiction of this Court be found in subsection (1). The general proposition that matters which are not mentioned in s. 41(3) must be held to be comprised in s. 41(1), with the consequence that this Court would have jurisdiction to entertain an appeal from a judgment of a nature similar to the one here considered, is ruled out by what was said by this Court in Goldhar v. The Queen and Paul v. The Queen. It may be a matter of regret that this Court has no jurisdiction to decide the important question which gave rise to conflicting opinions in the Court below, but strong as my views may be with respect to that question, I am clearly of opinion that this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain this appeal.\nThe italics are my own.\nAs has been pointed out, the Criminal Code makes express provision under s. 667 for appealing to the court of appeal of a province from the disposition made by a trial judge of an application for preventive detention and by s. 667(2) the Attorney General is limited to \"any ground of law\" in appealing from the dismissal of such an application. If counsel for the appellant were right in his contention that an appeal can be had to this Court under s. 41(1), at the instance of the Crown, from an order of the court of appeal setting aside a sentence of preventive detention, it would mean that although the Crown is restricted to \"any ground of law\" when appealing to the Court of Appeal of a province against the dismissal of an application for preventive detention by a trial judge, it can obtain access to this Court on unrestricted grounds when appealing from a judgment of the Court of Appeal which has the same effect. I cannot think that Parliament intended such an anomaly to result from the provisions of s. 667(2) of the Criminal Code and s. 41(1) of the Supreme Court Act.\nThe limitation to \"any ground of law\" of the right of the Attorney General to appeal to the Court of Appeal was first enacted by Chapter 43 of the Statutes of Canada, 1960-61, and s. 667(2) in its present form has not been previously considered by this Court.\nIn view of the above, I am of opinion that this Court is without jurisdiction in the circumstances and I would accordingly quash this appeal.\nAppeal quashed, TASCHEREAU C.J. and MARTLAND J. dissenting.\nSolicitor for the appellant: R.

Twelve items of these expenses were disallowed by the Minister on the grounds that some of them did not meet the requirements of s. 53(4) of the Income Tax Act, 1949 (Can.) (2nd Sess.), c. 25, and that the others came within the provisions of s. 83A(7) of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148, as enacted by 1955 (Can.), c. 54, s. 22. The Exchequer Court held that three items of expenses were not deductible and that the nine others were. Both the company and the Minister appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The company's appeal should be dismissed; the Minister's appeal should be allowed, subject to his admission that two items of expenditures and part of a third should be allowed as deductions.\nA detailed analysis of the agreements led to the conclusion that the remaining items of exploration expenses came within the provisions of s, 83A(7) (c), and accordingly their deduction should be disallowed.\nRevenu\u2014Imp\u00f4t sur le revenu\u2014D\u00e9ductions\u2014D\u00e9penses de prospection, d'exploration et de mise en valeur\u2014Compagnie d'exploitation et d'exploration mini\u00e8res\u2014Travaux faits en vertu d'ententes avec d'autres compagnies\u2014Loi de l'Imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, 1949 (Can.), (2\u00b0 Sec.), c. 25, art. 53(4)\u2014Loi de l'Imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, S.R.C. 1952, c. 148, art. s. 83A(7) (c).\nLa compagnie appelante, dont l'entreprise principale \u00e9tait l'exploitation mini\u00e8re ou l'exploration pour la d\u00e9couverte de min\u00e9raux, a pr\u00e9tendu d\u00e9duire de son revenu pour les ann\u00e9es 1950, 1951 et 1952, certaines d\u00e9penses \u00e9taient couvertes par les dispositions de l'art. 83A (7)(c), et en elle pour la recherche de min\u00e9raux aux termes d'ententes conclues avec diff\u00e9rentes compagnies et individus sur des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s appartenant \u00e0 ces compagnies et individus.

APPEAL by the company and APPEAL by the Minister from a judgment of Cattanach J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada[2], in a matter of income tax. Appeal of the company dismissed; appeal of the Minister allowed.\nAllan Findlay, Q.C., and A. S. Kingsmill, for Falconbridge Nickel Mines Ltd.\nG. W. Ainslie and D. G. H. Bowman, for the Minister of National Revenue.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014The issue in this appeal is the claim of Falconbridge Nickel Mines Limited to deduct from its income for the years 1950, 1951 and 1952 certain prospecting, exploration and development expenses. Throughout the proceedings the expenses have been classified into 12 items and I will maintain that classification. The money was all spent on properties owned by others under the terms of written agreements, which I shall have to analyse later. To obtain these deductions Falconbridge must show that they come within s. 53(4) of the 1949 Income Tax Amending Act, (1949), Second Session, c. 25. This section must be read with an explanatory amendment enacted in 1955 and made to apply retroactively to the years in question (Statutes of Canada 1955, c. 54, s. 22(1)).\nIn full the sections read:\n53 (4) A corporation whose chief business is that of mining or exploring for minerals may deduct, in computing its income for the purpose of the said Act for the year of expenditure, an amount equal to all prospecting, exploration and development expenses incurred by it, directly or indirectly, in searching for minerals during the calendar years 1950 to 1952, inclusive, if the corporation files certified statements of such expenditures and satisfies the Minister that it has been actively engaged in prospecting and exploring for minerals by means of qualified persons and has incurred the expenditures for such purposes.\n***\n83A (7) For the purposes of this section and section 53 of chapter 25 of the statutes of 1949 (Second Session), it is hereby declared that expenses incurred by a corporation, association, partnership or syndicate on or in respect of exploring or drilling for petroleum or natural gas in Canada or in searching for minerals in Canada do not and never did include expenses so incurred by that corporation, association, partnership or syndicate pursuant to an agreement under which it undertook to incur those expenses in consideration for\n(a) shares of the capital stock of a corporation that owned or controlled the mineral rights, (b) an option to purchase shares of the capital stock of a corporation that owned or controlled the mineral rights,\nor\n(c) a right to purchase shares of the capital stock of a corporation that was to be formed for the purpose of acquiring or controlling the mineral rights.\nI will begin with an analysis of the Gull Lake and the Gullbridge agreements. The properties on which these expenditures were made were owned by Newfoundland Gull Lake Mines Limited. That company and Falconbridge on August 17, 1950, made an agreement, which I now summarize.\n(a) Falconbridge agreed to pay to Gull Lake $2,500 for an exclusive option to purchase certain mining claims;\n(b) Falconbridge was to have 60 days to make an examination of the mining claims;\n(c) Falconbridge during the currency of the option was to have exclusive possession of the mining claims;\n(d) If Falconbridge before the expiry of the 60 days notified Gull Lake that it wished to proceed with the agreement, a new company was to be incorporated;\n(e) Upon the incorporation of the new company, Gull Lake and Falconbridge would transfer the mining claims to the new company and, as consideration for the transfer, the new company would allot to Gull Lake 500,000 of its Class \"A\" shares and would allot to Falconbridge such number of its Class \"B\" shares as could be purchased, at five cents per share, by a payment equal to $2,500 plus the amount that Falconbridge had expended in connection with the examination of the claims.\n(f) After the incorporation of the new company, the parties would cause the new company to enter into an agreement with Falconbridge under which Falconbridge would subscribe for shares in the new company on a specified basis and the new company would grant to Falconbridge an exclusive right or option to purchase a specified number of its Class \"B\" shares.\n(g) Falconbridge was under no obligation to cause any examination to be made, to expend any moneys or to perform any other act other than the payment of the $2,500. Falconbridge notified Gull Lake on October 20, 1950, that it wished to proceed with the agreement, with the result that a new company, Gullbridge Mines Limited, was incorporated on November 14, 1950, and on December 27, 1950, Falconbridge made with it the agreement contemplated in the Gull Lake agreement. These are the features of this Gullbridge agreement with which we are concerned:\n(a) Falconbridge subscribed and agreed to purchase 60, 241 Class \"B\" shares of Gullbridge at a price of 5 cents per share and 119,880 Class \"B\" shares for 10 cents per share. This was in accordance with the Gull Lake agreement and was an application of the $2,500 and the expenses to date on the purchase of shares.\n(b) Gullbridge granted Falconbridge 7 separate options to purchase a total of 2,059,638 Class \"B\" shares at specified times and prices.\nThe following clause gave Falconbridge the right to pay for the shares under option by the application of the moneys expended for exploration and development expenses:\n4. The parties hereto agree that instead of the Optionee (Falconbridge) taking up and paying for the shares the Optionee (Falconbridge) may expend the monies required to keep this option in force on diamond drilling and on other exploration, development and mining work on the said mining claims \u2026and the Optionee (Falconbridge) shall be reimbursed for all expenditures made by it on behalf of the Optionor (Gullbridge), such reimbursement being in the form of shares of the Optionor issued in accordance with the terms of this agreement.\nGULLBRIDGE\nThere are four items of expenditure relating to these agreements:\nDecision in\nDepartmental\nExchequer\nItem\nPeriod of Expenditure\nDecision\nCourt\nI. $ 10,512.05\nPrior to November 14, 1950, date of incorporation of Gullbridge\nDisallowed\nAllowed\nII. $ 4,953.73\nFrom November 14, 1950, to December 31, 1950\nDisallowed\nAllowed\nIII. $247,243.88\n1951\nDisallowed\nDisallowed\nIV. $ 56,047.26\n1952\nDisallowed\nDisallowed\nThe Minister appeals the allowance of the first two items and Falconbridge appeals the disallowance of the second two. Falconbridge applied all these expenditures on the purchase of shares under option at the specified prices.\nOn items I and II the learned trial judge[3] held:\nIn my view, this was not an agreement by which the appellant \"undertook\" to incur the expenses in question if the word \"undertook\", as used in s.s. (7) of Sec. 83A, implies, as I think it does, a legal liability enforceable by legal action.\nThis new company was incorporated with the name of Gullbridge Mines Limited on November 14, 1950 and the expenditures in question were incurred between that date and the end of that year. It would appear that these expenditures were not made pursuant to, or contemplated by, an agreement. What I have said with reference to the first item therefore applies with even greater force to the second item.\nOn Items III and IV the learned trial judge held:\nOn the other hand, s.s. (4) of s. 53 does require that the expenditures must have been \"incurred\" by the taxpayer before the taxpayer can deduct them under that subsection. I think it must follow from this that the expenditures must have been incurred by the taxpayer on its own account\u2014that is, as a principal and not merely as an agent or contractor for somebody else.\n\u2026it is sufficient to say that in my view an exploration company cannot be said to be carrying on such a programme on its own behalf when it is carrying it on under a contract under which it is to be reimbursed for the total expenses of the programme as such or under which it carries on the programme as a means of obtaining a credit for the amount of the expenses against an amount which it would otherwise have to pay in cash.\nThe Minister argues here that the learned trial judge was correct on items III and IV and that there is no difference between these and items I and II. The first question is were any of these items within the terms of s. 53(4)? Falconbridge undoubtedly spent its own money for prospecting, exploration and development. The first item was spent on the property when it belonged to Gull Lake, the next three on the property when it belonged to Gullbridge. When it expended this money it did not intend to confer a gratuitous benefit on these companies. Unless it took up the options this is what it would have been doing.\nThe legal position of Falconbridge in making these expenditures is easily defined. First, it was under no legal obligation to make any of them. Second, it was under no legal obligation to apply them on the purchase of shares under option although it had the right to do so. Third, it did not make them as agent or contractor for anyone. I cannot accept the characterization of the relationship found later in the judgment of the Exchequer Court as that of agent or contractor on behalf of the owner. As to the first two items, I differ from the opinion of the learned trial judge. I do not think that the word \"undertook\" as used in s. 83A(7) means that there must be a legal liability enforceable by legal action. The words \"pursuant to an agreement under which it undertook to incur those expenses in consideration for etc.\" mean no more than this. If Falconbridge takes it upon itself to spend this money on the property of another and it does so pursuant to an agreement which gives it that right, then the case is within s. 83A(7) if the consideration is as stated in the section.\nFurther, the trial judgment holds that the expenditures under item II were not made pursuant to any agreement. The Gullbridge agreement is dated December 27, 1950, and the money was spent between the date of incorporation of Gullbridge and the date of the agreement. There is no doubt that the parties treated these expenditures as having been made under the Gullbridge agreement and they were applied on the purchase of shares. Falconbridge was not making a gift of these expenditures. The Gullbridge agreement was contemplated and spelled out in the prior Gull Lake agreement which had as a schedule the proposed agreement with the new company. The new company issued shares for these expenditures when the option was exercised. What more is needed? It was not necessary to wait until the agreement was formally executed.\nI am therefore of the opinion that there was twofold error in allowing Falconbridge to deduct items I and II.\nAs to items III and IV, in my opinion there was error in holding that these expenditures were reimbursed when Falconbridge applied them on the purchase of shares instead of paying cash, and that Falconbridge consequently did not incur these expenditures within the meaning of s. 53(4). If A spends money on the strength of a promise of B to reimburse him, he expects to receive money in return. Where B only promises an option on its share capital if A chooses to apply the expenditure in this way, then there is no reimbursement and I say that notwithstanding the use of the word in paragraph 4 of the Gullbridge agreement. If the expenditure is not applied on the purchase of shares, Gullbridge is under no obligation. I can get no help either way from Okalta Oils Limited v. Minister of National Revenue[4], and Corporation of Birmingham v. Barnes[5]. In the Okalta case a Crown corporation had advanced the money for exploration. The company was under no obligation to repay except out of production from the well. The well was unproductive. The oil company tried to include this subsidy in its drilling costs for the purpose of claiming a tax credit, which at that time was 26 2\/3 per cent of its costs. The Exchequer Court held that the oil company had not incurred those costs. In this Court[6], the point was not considered. On the other hand, in the Birmingham case, the corporation received a subsidy from the government to cover part of the cost of the reconstruction of certain tramlines. This came from the Unemployment Grants Committee. It also received a contribution towards the cost of a new line from a company that the new line was intended to serve. The question in issue was whether the corporation was entitled to include these two contributions in its cost when claiming a capital cost allowance in making its Income Tax Return. The House of Lords held that it was. Neither case touches the present problem.\nAnother ground given in the Exchequer Court for the disallowance of items III and IV was that Falconbridge had not incurred these expenditures on its own account. The reasoning is given in the extracts above quoted. Falconbridge did not incur these expenditures as agent or contractor for somebody else and the right to apply the expenditure on shares, which, I have said, was erroneously called reimbursement, cannot turn the operation into one carried on on behalf of somebody else.\nIn conclusion then I say that all these four items represent expenditures for exploration and were incurred by Falconbridge within the meaning of s. 53(4). I would disallow all four solely under the provisions of s. 83A (7) (c).\nThe next four items of expenditure relate to agreements made with Rambler Mines Limited and Rambridge Mines Limited. They are similar in set-up to those made with Gull Lake and Gullbridge. The Rambler agreement is dated October 21, 1950. It gives Falconbridge the right to make an examination for a period of 60 days on certain mining claims. Falconbridge was not legally bound to proceed with this examination. If Falconbridge wished to proceed with the agreement, the parties would cause a new company to be incorporated to which the mining claims would be transferred. In consideration of the transfer, the new company would issue and allot all its shares, 40 per cent to Rambler and 60 per cent to Falconbridge. Then Rambler and Falconbridge would cause the new company to enter into an agreement providing for the deposit in escrow of the issued shares to be released on defined conditions. Falconbridge did notify Rambler of its intention to proceed. The new company Rambridge Mines Limited, was incorporated on January 10, 1951. On February 16, 1951, the parties entered into the Rambridge agreement, the form of which had already been settled as a schedule to the Rambler agreement, and under this agreement Falconbridge agreed to extend or advance to Rambridge the sum of $100,000 at certain intervals within twenty-four months subject to the right of Falconbridge to discontinue at any time on giving Rambridge 30 days' notice. Any moneys expended in excess of $100,000 would be treated as a loan by Falconbridge to Rambridge and would be repayable before any dividends could be declared.\nThere are four items of expenditure relating to these agreements:\nRAMBRIDGE\nDecision in\nDepartmental\nExchequer\nItem\nPeriod of Expenditure\nDecision\nCourt\nV. $20,435.41\n1950\nDisallowed\nAllowed\nVI. $15,123.57\nFrom January 1, 1951 to\nFebruary 16, 1951, date of\nexecution of Rambridge\nAgreement\nDisallowed\nAllowed\nVII. $13,765.73\nFrom February 1, 1951 to\nDecember 31, 1951\nVIII. $13,677.6\n1952\nThe learned trial judge in his reasons for judgment in dealing with items V and VI adopted the same reasoning as he did in dealing with items I and II. In this I think that there was the twofold error I have already noted. However, item V must be dealt with on different grounds. The Minister, in his exchange of documents when the taxpayer filed an appeal, agreed with the taxpayer's contention on item V and agreed to vary his assessment accordingly. The same applies to part of item VI. That part amounts to $4,212.36, leaving the balance of item VI $10,911.21. These items, because of the Minister's notification, were not included in the company's Notices of Appeal to the Exchequer Court. I think that once he had agreed with the taxpayer's submission and agreed to vary the assessment, the assessment must be taken as varied. Consequently, these two amounts were not in issue in the Exchequer Court and nothing more needs to be said about them.\nWith regard to the balance of item VI, the whole of item VII, and the whole of item VIII, the same result must follow as under the Gull Lake\u2014Gullbridge agreements. The learned trial judge was of the opinion that these expenditures were made pursuant to an agreement but not the kind of agreement dealt with in s. 83A (7). He thought that the consideration was \"shares of the capital stock of a corporation that was to be formed for the purpose of acquiring or controlling the mineral rights, namely, 83A (7)(c)\", and that this was not a right to purchase such shares within the subsection. I cannot understand this distinction. The right to purchase shares of the capital stock of a corporation to be formed to hold the claims includes the actual issue of the shares and their delivery in escrow just as it does an option to purchase. If Falconbridge carried out the terms of the agreement and expended the $100,000 within the times specified, then it would be entitled to purchase the shares and have them delivered free of the escrow.\nThe next two items, items IX and X, arose from an agreement dated June 15, 1952, between Falconbridge and Jawtam Key Gold Zones (Rambler) Limited. There were minor differences in detail which do not affect the principles to be applied. The claims were transferred to a trustee pending transfer to a new company. There was the usual six months for the preliminary examination and then another 30 months during which time Falconbridge was required to expend $50,000. If it gave notice requiring the incorporation of the new company and had not spent the $50,000, the difference had to be paid to Jawtam. On the incorporation of the new company the claims had to be delivered by the trustee to it, whereupon it was to issue its shares\u2014one-fifth to Jawtam and four-fifths to Falconbridge. Falconbridge never gave notice to require the incorporation of the new company and eventually abandoned its option on March 4, 1955. Particulars of the items are as follows:\nJAWTAM\nDecision in\nDepartmental\nExchequer\nItem\nPeriod of Expenditure\nDecision\nCourt\nIX. $6,991.89\nUntil October 16, 1952\nX. $6, 221.00\nOctober 17, 1952 to the end\nof the year.\nAs to both items, the learned trial judge held, as he had done with reference to items I and II, that Falconbridge had not undertaken these expenditures in the sense of entering into a legally enforceable agreement and that they were not made pursuant to any agreement. He consequently allowed the deductions. I have already expressed my disagreement with these propositions. However, item IX must be dealt with in the same way as item V and part of item VI. The Minister accepted the taxpayer's submission on item IX and agreed to vary the assessment. I would therefore allow the deduction on this ground alone. As to item X where there was no admission and agreement to vary the assessment, s. 83A (7)(c) applies and the deduction is disallowed.\nSTANMORE\nItem XI $15,063.71.\nThis agreement is dated April 27, 1951, between Falconbridge, Stanmore Mining Smelting Limited and a number of other companies and individuals. The purpose was to get certain mining claims consolidated and transferred to a new company. Falconbridge advanced to Stanmore $5,000 for this purpose and had the right to purchase free treasury shares of the new company at 10 cents per share with this sum. The agreement went on to provide that Falconbridge would act as manager for a minimum period of three years; that it would receive shares at 10 cents per share for the first $10,000 expended on development and shares at the rate of 25 cents per share for the next $40,000 of expenditure. Falconbridge bound itself to expend up to this sum of $50,000. In 1951 and 1952 Falconbridge spent a total of $65,063.71 in exploring and developing the claims. It is common ground between the parties that s. 83A(7) prevents any deduction for the first $50,000. However, Falconbridge sought, in computing its income for 1952, to deduct the balance of $15,063.71. The learned trial judge disallowed this deduction on the ground above stated, that these expenditures were made not on its own behalf and were therefore not expenses incurred by it within the meaning of s. 53(4). I disagree with this reasoning but I think the case is within s. 83A (7)(c) and the deduction is accordingly disallowed.\nBRODIE\nItem XII $3,603.14\nThis agreement is dated July 29, 1952 and was made with two individuals. It granted an option to purchase certain mining claims. Falconbridge had the usual 60 days to make an examination during which period it was to give the optionors notice that it wished to proceed. The agreement also provided that Falconbridge could have a new company incorporated to acquire and hold the claims and Falconbridge would be entitled to receive shares for its development expenses in this new company. In 1952 Falconbridge spent the above mentioned sum of $3,603.14 in conducting its examination. It did not proceed with the incorporation of the new company and it elected to abandon the option. The learned trial judge held, as he did with item I, that there was no \"legally enforceable agreement\" within s. 83A (7). On the contrary, I think that the item is within s. 83A (7)(c) and that the deduction must be disallowed.\nThe result is that all the items are disallowed as coming within s. 83A (7) (c) with the exceptions item V, item VI to the extent of $4,212.36, and item IX as to which there were admissions.\nFalconbridge appealed the disallowance of items III, IV and XI. The Minister appealed or moved to vary on all the other items. The company's appeal fails and is dismissed with costs. The Minister's appeal succeeds on everything except item V, part of item VI and item IX. All the assessments made by the Minister stand with this exception. There should be no costs of the Minister's appeal. The issues discussed were the same as those involved in the appeal with the exception of quantum, date and detail. Appeal of the Company dismissed with costs; appeal of the Minister allowed without costs.\nSolicitors for Falconbridge Nickel Mines Ltd: Tilley, Carson, Findlay & Wedd, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the Minister of National Revenue: E.

When, from time to time, a defective door on one of the respondent's barns fell to the ground, it was part of the duty of the appellant to raise the door again to an upright position so that it would lean against the barn. While thus attempting to lift the door the appellant suffered a severe injury described as a protruded intervertebral disc between the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrae. The trial judge dismissed the appellant's action for damages on the ground that the risk of injury resulting from the failure to repair the door was not such as ought reasonably to have been foreseen. The trial judgment was affirmed by a unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal and from that judgment an appeal was brought to this Court.\nHeld (Martland and Ritchie JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.\nPer Cartwright, Judson and Hall JJ.: The employer failed in its duty to the appellant when it allowed the door to remain in the defective condition which had existed for many months. That breach of duty caused the injury of which the appellant complained; that it could do so was not only foreseeable but actually foreseen. In the circumstances of the case the maxim volenti non fit injuria had no application. Consequently, the appellant was entitled to judgment against the employer for the amount of damages ($19,010.01) assessed by the trial judge, as to which no question was raised in the argument before this Court. Glasgow Corporation v. Muir, [1943] A. C. 448, referred to.\nPer Martland and Ritchie JJ., dissenting: An employer's duty to maintain his plant and property only arose in respect of each employee if the lack of maintenance created a situation of potential danger for him. \"Danger\" in this sense meant risk of injury to the employee in the carrying out of his duties and \"risk\" in turn did not mean a mere remote possibility but a potential peril which a reasonable man could foresee as not unlikely to injure the employee in question. In the present case, under all the circumstances as they existed on the evening when the injury was sustained, the broken barn door as it lay on the ground did not constitute any danger whatever and the task of lifting it back into place when it had fallen to the ground did not give rise to any foreseeable risk against which the employer was under a duty to safeguard its employee. Regal Oil & Refining Co. et al. v. Campbell, [1936] S.C.R. 309; Bolton v. Stone, [1959] A.C. 850; Qualcast (Wolverhampton) Ltd. v. Haynes, [1959] A.C. 743, referred to.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1] , affirming a judgment of Smith J. Appeal as against respondent company and trustee in bankruptcy allowed, Martland and Ritchie JJ. dissenting; appeal as against individual respondents dismissed.\nP. W. Schulman and M. M. Schulman, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nG. H. Lockwood and D. Proctor, for the defendants, respondents.\nThe judgment of Cartwright, Judson and Hall JJ. was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014Pursuant to leave granted by my brother Judson, the appellant appeals in forma pauperis from a unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[2] affirming the judgment of Smith J. dismissing the appellant's action with costs. The learned trial judge assessed the plantiff's damages at the sum of $19,010.01 and in the argument before this Court no question was raised as to this assessment.\nIn October 1960 the appellant was employed by A & R Farms Ltd., hereinafter referred to as \"the employer\" as a farm labourer on its farm at Dugald, Manitoba. The feed barn on this farm was entered by a doorway 8 feet wide with two sliding doors. Each of these doors was 7 feet in height and 4 feet 4 inches in width and was said to weigh between 100 and 125 lbs. Originally the doors were suspended from overhead tracks. The door on the right, as one faces the barn, was still so suspended but from some date before the appellant was employed the overhead track from which the door on the left had been suspended was missing and when it was necessary to open it it had to be lifted or slid sideways. It would then be leaned against the side of the barn in an upright position. From time to time this door would fall or be blown down and would have to be raised up again to its leaning position against the barn. On such occasions it was part of the duty of the appellant to raise the door. This situation was well known to all the parties throughout the period of the appellant's employment.\nOn May 9, 1961, the door was lying on the ground and the plaintiff proceeded to raise it into an upright position and in so doing suffered a severe injury described as a protruded intervertebral disc between the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrae.\nThe learned trial judge was of opinion that the door should have been repaired and that it was surprising that it had been left in the condition described for so long a period but he dismissed the action on the ground that the risk of injury resulting from the failure to repair was not such as ought reasonably to have been foreseen. He said in part:\nThis is a case of an employee injured while performing the duties of his employment. The injury occurred while he was in the course of raising a barn door which had been lying on the ground, intending to place it in position to cover the door opening.\nIt is an employer's duty to keep the premises in which his employees work reasonably safe, and the matter of liability in this case depends upon the answer to the question: Was this door a source of danger, in the condition in which it then was, and was it foreseeable that as a result someone was likely to be injured while lifting it?\n***\nThere was no reason to think that lifting the door was likely to cause injury. Injury was not reasonably forseeable as a consequence of so doing.\nThe Court of Appeal agreed with the view of the learned trial judge. Guy J.A. who wrote the unanimous judgment of the Court said in part:\nThat being so, we have to consider here whether or not the failure to repair the barn door, and leaving it in such a condition that it had to be lifted into place from time to time, could, as such be 'reasonably foreseen' as the cause of injury such as the plaintiff sustained here. We think not.\nIn the circumstances outlined above I think it clear that the employer failed in its duty to take reasonable care to see that the property where its servant was required to work was safe, and that as a result of such failure the appellant was injured. The only question of difficulty is whether the injury to the appellant was a reasonably foreseeable result of the employer's failure. In Glasgow Corporation v. Muir[3] , at p. 457, Lord Macmillan said:\nLegal liability is limited to those consequences of our acts which a reasonable man of ordinary intelligence and experience so acting would have in contemplation.\nThis rule is equally applicable whether the fault imputed to the defendant is an act or, as in the case at bar, an omission.\nIn the same case, at p. 457, Lord Macmillan continued:\nThe standard of foresight of the reasonable man is, in one sense, an impersonal test. It eliminates the personal equation and is independent of the idiosyncrasies of the particular person whose conduct is in question. Some persons are by nature unduly timorous and imagine every path beset with lions. Others, of more robust temperament, fail to foresee or nonchalantly disregard even the most obvious dangers. The reasonable man is presumed to be free both from over-apprehension and from over-confidence, but there is a sense in which the standard of care of the reasonable man involves in its application a subjective element. It is still left to the judge to decide what, in the circumstances of the particular case, the reasonable man would have had in contemplation, and what, accordingly, the party sought to be made liable ought to have foreseen. Here there is room for diversity of view, as, indeed, is well illustrated in the present case. What to one judge may seem far-fetched may seem to another both natural and probable.\nCounsel for the appellant makes two submissions on this branch of the case.\nThe first is that the learned judges in the Courts below erred in failing to hold that a reasonable man in the position of this employer would have foreseen that the condition of the door was a probable source of injury to persons working in its vicinity, that this is sufficient to impose liability and that it is not necessary to determine whether he would have foreseen injury caused in the precise manner in which the appellant was injured. In support of this, reference is made to such cases as Winnipeg Electric Railway Co. v. Canadian Northern Railway Co.; Re Bartlett[4] and Hughes v. Lord Advocate[5] . The second submission is that in this case it was unnecessary for the learned trial judge to consider what the reasonable man would have had in contemplation and ought to have foreseen because the evidence shows that the employer contemplated and foresaw that injury of the very sort which the appellant suffered might well be caused by failure to put the door in a safe condition.\nI have reached the conclusion that the second of these submissions should be upheld and this renders it unnecessary for me to reach a final conclusion as to the first, although I incline to the view that it should be upheld also.\nIn the direct examination of the appellant at the trial the following questions and answers appear:\nQ. Did you have any conversation with the defendant, Delmer Percy, about the door before the 9th of May, 1961?\nA. Oh, yes, after I had hired on there, we were doing some small repairs in different barns, and we had discussed repairing the door several times in case somebody got hurt.\nQ. Can you tell us what was said in any of these conversations?\nA. Yes, Delmer had discussed fixing the door and the tools were there and the only thing needed was to get the material. Delmer himself said the door should be fixed.\nQ. Do you remember any specific conversations with Delmer about the door?\nA. Well, after I got hurt\u2014\nQ. No, before the 9th of May, 1961?\nA. Well, we had discussed repairing the door several times and putting it back where it belonged for fear somebody could get hurt.\nQ. Was it specifically said in these conversations that as you have just stated 'For fear somebody could get hurt'? Was there some mention of somebody getting hurt on these conversations?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Who said it?\nA. Well, the both of us had said the same thing. With the children running around the barn the door could fall on them or somebody could get hurt by lifting it.\nThe transcript of the cross-examination of the appellant at the trial occupies 27 pages of the case but he was not cross-examined as to these conversations.\nThe defendant Delmer Percy was called as a witness for the defendants but was not asked about the conversation to which the appellant had deposed.\nIn these circumstances we must take it that the conversation sworn to by the appellant took place. Were it otherwise I cannot think that he would not have been cross-examined as to it and that Delmer Percy would not have denied it. The situation then is that, before the event, the employer's manager, Percy, and the appellant had both realized, and stated, that the defective condition of the door was a source of danger of injury occurring in the very way in which the appellant was in fact injured. The knowledge of Percy is, in the circumstances, the knowledge of the employer. It is not necessary to debate whether a reasonable man in the position of the employer ought to have foreseen the danger when we know that in fact it was actually foreseen by it.\nThe learned trial judge did not overlook the evidence which I have quoted above and which appears to me to be of crucial importance. He dealt with it as follows:\nThe plaintiff's evidence of a conversation with Mr. Percy about the need to repair the door was clearly inspired by the thought that it might fall and injure a child. Any reference to possible injury in lifting it was I feel sure only incidental and not a matter of real concern.\nWith the greatest respect I am unable to agree with this view of the importance of the conversation referred to.\nIn the respondent's argument stress was laid on the evidence in the record that an injury similar to that suffered by the appellant could be caused by lifting a sack of feed or by types of exertion less strenuous than that of raising the door. I am unable to see how the employer is assisted on the question of foreseeability by showing that injury to an employee's back similar to that sustained by the appellant may well result from activities in regard to which no blame attaches to the employer. Such evidence would be relevant to the question whether the omission of the employer did in fact cause the appellant's injury but in the case at bar that question is no longer debatable.\nIn my opinion, the employer failed in its duty to the appellant when it allowed the door to remain in the defective condition which had existed for many months, that breach of duty caused the injury of which the appellant complains, that it could do so was not only foreseeable but actually foreseen, in the circumstances of this case the maxim volenti non fit injuria has no application and consequently the appellant is entitled to judgment against the employer for the amount at which the learned trial judge assessed his damages.\nAt the conclusion of the argument of counsel for the appellant we told counsel for the respondents that it was unnecessary to hear them in regard to the appeal as to Delmer Charles Percy and Anne Merle Percy and the appeal as against those two persons will be dismissed.\nBy orders made in the Court of Queen's Bench on March 12, 1964, and March 19, 1964, it was directed that the action be continued against A & R Farms Ltd. notwithstanding its bankruptcy and also against the Trustee of A & R Farms Ltd. in bankruptcy.\nI would allow the appeal against A & R Farms Ltd. and the Trustee of A & R Farms Ltd. in bankruptcy and direct that judgment be entered against them for $19,010.01 with costs throughout, the costs of the appellant in this Court to be taxed as provided by Rule 142(4). I would dismiss the appeal as against Delmer Charles Percy and Anne Merle Percy but would direct that as to them there be no order as to costs in this Court or in the Courts below.\nThe judgment of Martland and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nRITCHIE J. (dissenting):\u2014I have had the benefit of reading the reasons for judgment of my brother Cartwright who has outlined the factual background giving rise to this appeal.\nThe appellant, who was familiar with conditions existing on the turkey farm owned by the respondent A & R Farms Ltd., including the state of disrepair of the sliding door giving access to the feed barn, accepted employment on that farm as a hired man on December 15, 1960, with duties which he describes as follows:\nMy normal course of duties were I had to feed the chickens, feed the turkeys, grind feed, bedding the birds, gathering eggs and anything else that came along that needed to be done.\nOne of the things \"that came along that needed to be done\" on the farm was to pick up the untracked portion of the feed barn door when it had fallen to the ground, and the appellant says that he had done this a number of times without difficulty during the first five months of his employment, but that on the evening of May 9, 1961, when he was lifting the door he strained his back with the results for which he now claims damages. The injury was sustained when the appellant had lifted the door to approximately shoulder height and in making the extra effort \"to put it in a standing position\" he says \"I took this pain in the back and the next thing I knew I was on the ground with the door laying on top of me\". There is no evidence that the ground was slippery or that the door would have been likely to fall on him if the appellant had not suffered the strain which was later diagnosed as what is now commonly called \"a slipped disc\", nor indeed was there any suggestion that the injury which the appellant suffered was caused by the door having fallen on him. In fact the appellant's own doctor gave it as his opinion that \"The fall backwards was the result of the injury to the back rather than the cause\".\nThe door in question had been broken since the farm property was acquired by A & R Farms Ltd. in December 1957 and between that date and the time of the accident it was lifted from the ground on many occasions by Delmer Percy the farm foreman and president of A & R Farms Ltd. and once by his wife. The condition of the door also made it necessary, when it was standing, to lift it up so as to slide it over in opening or closing the barn and this work had been done by the respondent Percy's sixty-seven year old father and by a hired man then employed on the farm and by others. In all this time there was no suggestion that anyone had any difficulty or suffered any kind of strain or injury through lifting the weight of the door, but the learned trial judge found that it weighed between 100 and 125 pounds and it therefore appears to me to have been a foreseeable possibility that \"somebody could get hurt by lifting it\" to use the words which the appellant attributed to Delmer Percy. (The italics are, of course, my own).\nWith the greatest respect for those who hold a different view, I do not think that the question of whether \"somebody could get hurt by lifting it\" is determinative of this appeal. In my view the questions to be determined are whether the door as it lay on the ground created such a likelihood of causing injury to the appellant as to make the premises unsafe and whether it was foreseeable that the appellant was likely to be hurt while lifting it.\nThe learned trial judge stated the problem in these words:\nIt is an employer's duty to keep the premises in which his employees work reasonably safe, and the matter of liability in this case depends upon the answer to the question: Was this door a source of danger, in the condition in which it then was, and was it foreseeable that as a result someone was likely to be injured while lifting it? This is, in my view, fundamentally a question of fact which was answered in the negative by both of the Courts below and although it is, of course, open to this Court to reach a different conclusion, great respect must be accorded to such a finding and also to the findings of the learned trial judge with respect to the weight to be attached to the evidence.\nThe duty owed by an employer to his employees under such circumstances was concisely stated by Sir Lyman Duff in this Court in Regal Oil & Refining Co. Ltd. et al. v. Campbell[6] , at p. 312 where he said:\nBy the common law, an employer is under an obligation arising out of the relation of master and servant to take reasonable care to see that the plant and property used in the business in which the servant is employed is safe. That is well settled and well known law. It is equally well settled that he does not warrant the safety of such plant and property.\nThe employer's duty to maintain his plant and property only arises in respect of each employee if the lack of maintenance has created a situation of potential danger for him.\nI venture to say that there are many farms in this country where things which need to be done have been left undone from year to year but this does not mean that every farmer when he engages a hired man to help him comes under a duty to repair all defects in his plant and machinery. It is only when lack of maintenance is such as to expose the new employee to danger that the employer owes him a duty to effect repairs.\n\"Danger\" in this sense, as I understand it, means risk of injury to the employee in the carrying out of his duties and \"risk\" in turn does not mean a mere remote possibility but a potential peril which a reasonable man could foresee as not unlikely to injure the employee in question. In a different context, Lord Reid was considering the general duty which each man owes to his neighbour in Bolton v. Stone[7] , and having obviously examined many cases he observed that he found:\nA tendency to base duty rather on the likelihood of the damage resulting than on its foreseeability alone.\nIt is to be noted, as I have suggested, that the employer's duty of care is owed to each employee as an individual, and in determining whether a foreseeable risk exists which could give rise to such a duty, account must be taken of the individual characteristics of each employee. The matter was made plain by Lord Radcliffe in the course of his reasons for judgment in Qualcast (Wolverhampton) Ltd. v. Haynes[8] , at p. 753 where he said:\nThe second point is that, however much attention is concentrated in these cases upon the adequacy of the system of working at the place of work, actions of negligence are concerned with the duty of care as between a particular employer and a particular workman. An experienced workman dealing with a familiar and obvious risk may not reasonably need the same attention or the same precautions as an inexperienced man who is likely to be more receptive of advice or admonition.\nIn determining whether the event which happened in the present case was reasonably to be foreseen and guarded against by the employer, consideration must be given not only to the fact that for more than three years someone had lifted the door up every time it had fallen down without any strain or difficulty being experienced, but also to the question of whether it was at all likely that a healthy man who was 32 years of age, 5'11\" tall, weighed 180 pounds and had been brought up on a farm would injure himself in doing a routine task of lifting which he had been doing without difficulty for the past five months. In my view it was not an injury which a reasonable employer would have been likely to contemplate.\nThe question of whether or not the broken barn door constituted a danger or hazard against which the employer was under a duty to protect its employee, is in my opinion, to be determined in light of the circumstances as they existed on the evening of May 9, 1961, when the injury was sustained. At this time, as I have said, the door was lying on the ground where it had been all day and I do not think the fact that if it had been standing up it might have been blown or fallen over so as to hit the appellant on the head or back is a circumstance which affects the employer's liability in respect of an injury sustained by lifting it.\nThere is no evidence to suggest that the door presented any danger to anybody so long as it remained on the ground, and the sole question is whether the appellant was placed in danger against which his employer was under a duty to protect him when he was performing the task of picking it up. It is true that the door was in the position in which the appellant found it because the respondent had failed to have it repaired, but this lack of maintenance does not constitute negligence qua the appellant unless it can be said that he was thereby exposed to risk. The breach of duty which gives rise to liability in such a case as this is a breach of the employer's duty to safeguard his employee against unnecessary danger and the fact that the failure to maintain a piece of equipment may constitute a risk under one set of circumstances does not fix the employer with any such duty in relation to that equipment under a different set of circumstances in which no danger exists.\nIt was, however, submitted by the appellant's counsel that the foreseeability of the door injuring the appellant by being blown down formed a ground for liability in respect of the damage which he sustained in picking it up, and in support of this proposition he cited such cases as Hughes v. Lord Advocate[9] , and Winnipeg Electric Railway Co. v. Canadian Northern Railway Co.; Re Bartlett[10] .I can derive no assistance from these cases because they appear to me to be primarily concerned with liability for the unexpected consequences of a breach of duty whereas in my view the primary question in the present case is whether any duty existed to be breached. For the same reason I find it unnecessary to discuss the famous case of Re Polemis and Furness, Withy & Co[11] .\nUnder all the circumstances as they existed on the afternoon and evening of May 9, 1961, I do not think that the broken barn door as it lay on the ground constituted any danger whatever and I am satisfied that the task of lifting it back into place when it had fallen to the ground did not give rise to any foreseeable risk against which his employer was under a duty to safeguard this appellant.\nFor these reasons as well as for those given by the learned trial judge, I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal as against respondent company and trustee in bankruptcy allowed with costs, MARTLAND and RITCHIE JJ. dissenting; appeal as against individual respondents dismissed.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Schulman & Schulman, Winnipeg.\nSolicitors for the defendants, respondents: Pitblado, Hoskin & Company, Winnipeg.\n[1] (1965), 50 W.W.R. 705.\n[2] (1965), 50 W.W.R. 705.\n[3] [1943] A.C. 448.\n[4] (1919), 59 S.C.R. 352, 50 D.L.R. 194.\n[5] [1963] A.C. 837.\n[6] [1936] S.C.R. 309.\n[7] [1951] A.C. 850.\n[8] [1959] A.C. 743.\n[9] [1963] A.C. 837.\n[10] (1919), 59 S.C.R. 352, 50 D.L.R. 194.\n[11] [1921] 3 K.B. 560.\n",

Hertz Drive Yourself Stations of Ontario Ltd. et al., [1966] S.C.R. 13\nDate: 1965-10-14\nMarjorie Gorman (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nHertz Drive Yourself Stations of Ontario Limited (Otherwise Known as Hertz Rent-A-Car) and Margaret Florence Athron (Defendants) Respondents.\n1965: June 9, 10, 11; 1965: October 14.\nPresent: Cartwright, Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nDamages\u2014Motor vehicle accident\u2014Award by trial judge reduced by Court of Appeal\u2014Appeal against quantum of damages as varied by Court of Appeal\u2014Appeal successful\u2014Applicable principles.\nIn an action arising out of an automobile collision between a vehicle driven by the plaintiff G and one driven by H, the trial judge found that the collision occurred solely through the negligence of the defendant A who was driving an automobile owned by the defendant car-rental company. Although there was an appeal from that finding, such appeal was dismissed and the only issue on the appeal to this Court was that of the quantum of damages as varied by the Court of Appeal.\nPrior to the accident, the plaintiff, a woman of 60 years of age, was active, drove her car constantly and engaged in sports such as golf and curling. She suffered a number of different injuries of varying severity and importance and as a result was permanently crippled. The trial judge awarded her $35,000 in general damages which with other damages resulted in judgment in her favour for $42,451.18. The Court of Appeal was of the opinion that the trial judge\u2019s assessment of general damages was \u201cso excessive that it cannot be upheld\u201d and reduced same to $22,500.\nHeld (Judson J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the trial judge restored.\nPer Cartwright, Martland and Ritchie JJ.: The Court of Appeal had not erred in stating the principles by which it should be guided but had erred in holding that the amount at which damages were assessed was so excessive as to warrant its interference. On this view of the matter the duty of this Court was as declared in s. 46 of the Supreme Court Act to \u201cgive the judgment\u2026that the Court, whose decision is appealed against should have given\u201d. That Court should have dismissed the appeal.\nPutting the matter in another way, where the court of first instance had not erred in principle, it was error in principle for the court of appeal to reduce damages unless they were so excessive as to constitute a wholly erroneous estimate and the question of whether or not they were so excessive must be decided by the second appellate court from a perusal of the evidence. Per Martland, Ritchie and Spence JJ.: This Court would not vary damages adjudged by the court of appeal in a province which had varied those assessed by the trial judge \u201cexcept in the most exceptional circumstances\u201d, and the so-called exceptional circumstances were those where this Court was of the opinion that the court of appeal had committed an error in principle. Before a court of appeal could properly intervene, it must be satisfied that the trial judge applied a wrong principle of law or, short of that, that the amount awarded by the trial judge was so inordinately high or so inordinately low as to be a wholly erroneous estimate of the damage.\nIn the present case counsel for the defendants failed to demonstrate that the trial judge, acting, as was suggested, upon the submission of counsel for the plaintiff, separately assessed damages for each injury and then totalled them in order to arrive at his award. But even if such an inept formula had been used, no authority was cited to show that it was wrong in principle.\nOn a perusal of the evidence, it was determined that the trial judge could have arrived at a figure of $35,000 for general damages without the award being such as to earn the description as being \u201cso inordinately high as to be a wholly erroneous estimate of damages\u201d.\nPratt v.

This case was within their power of review and this Court should not interfere with their judgment.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, reducing the amount of damages awarded by Moorhouse J. after a trial without a jury. Appeal allowed, Judson J. dissenting.\nE.J. Houston, Q.C., and A.R.M. O\u2019Connor, Q.C., for the plaintiff, appellant.\nJ.D. Arnup, Q.C., and S. Sadinsky, for the defendants, respondents.\nMartland J. concurred with the judgment delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014The relevant facts and the course of the proceedings in the Courts below are set out in the reasons of my brother Spence. I agree with his conclusion that this appeal should be allowed and there is little that I wish to add.\nFor the reasons given by my brother Spence I agree with him that it has not been shewn that the learned trial judge made any error in principle in arriving at the amount of general damages. On the other hand, I find it difficult to say that the Court of Appeal dealt with the matter on any wrong principle. The ground on which that Court proceeded was that the learned trial judge\u2019s assessment of general damages was \u201cso excessive that it cannot be upheld\u201d. In my opinion that phrase was used in the reasons of Schroeder J.A. as the equivalent of the one adopted by Viscount Simon in Nance\u2019s case, \u201cso inordinately high that it must be a wholly erroneous estimate of the damage\u201d, and of the similar expressions in other cases also quoted by my brother Spence, with all of which the learned justice of appeal was, of course, familiar.\nAfter a perusal of all the relevant evidence I agree with the conclusion of my brother Spence that the award made by the learned trial Judge was not \u201cso inordinately high as to be a wholly erroneous estimate of damages\u201d; indeed, with the greatest respect for those who think otherwise, the amount does not seem to me to be excessive. This is the sort of question on which there may well be differences of judicial opinion.\nIt results from this that, in my opinion, the Court of Appeal has not erred in stating the principles by which it should be guided but has erred in holding that the amount at which the damages were assessed was so excessive as to warrant its interference. On this view of the matter what is the duty of this Court? I do not think that we are bound to dismiss the appeal merely because no error in principle on the part of the Court of Appeal has been demonstrated. Having reached the conclusion that the amount awarded by the learned trial judge was such that the Court of Appeal ought not to have varied it, it appears to me that our duty is as declared in s. 46 of the Supreme Court Act, to \u201cgive the judgment\u2026that the Court, whose decision is appealed against, should have given\u201d. In my opinion, that Court should have dismissed the appeal.\nIt may be that the matter is merely one of words and that a simpler method of expression, which would be in accordance with those used in the cases collected in the reasons of my brother Spence, would be to say that, where the court of first instance has not erred in principle, it is error in principle for the court of appeal to reduce damages unless they are so excessive as to constitute a wholly erroneous estimate and that the question whether or not they are so excessive must be decided by the second appellate court from a perusal of the evidence. Whichever way the matter is put I am satisfied that in the case at bar the award of the learned trial judge ought not to have been varied.\nI would dispose of the appeal as proposed by my brother Spence.\nJUDSON J. (dissenting):\u2014I agree with the judgment of the Court of Appeal. I think that this case was within their power of review and that this Court should not interfere with their judgment.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014I agree with my brothers Cartwright and Spence that the award of the learned trial judge ought not to have been varied and I would dispose of the appeal as proposed by my brother Spence.\nWith respect to the Gorman appeal, Martland J. concurred with the judgment delivered by\nSPENCE J.:\u2014These are two appeals against the judgments of the Court of Appeal for Ontario. Both judgments in that Court reduced amounts awarded by the learned trial judge after a trial without a jury.\nThe actions arose as a result of an automobile collision which occurred on Highway 17 near the City of Ottawa, between a vehicle driven by the appellant Marjorie Gorman and one driven by the late Dr. William Hossack in which his wife, the late Mary Ann Hossack, and his infant son, Brian Hossack, were passengers. Dr. Hossack and Mrs. Hossack were killed. Mrs. Gorman and Brian Hossack were injured.\nThe learned trial judge found that the collision occurred solely through the negligence of the defendant Margaret Florence Athron who was driving an automobile owned by the defendant Hertz Drive Yourself Stations of Ontario Ltd. Although there was an appeal from that finding, such appeal was dismissed and the only issue in this appeal is that of the quantum of damages as varied by the Court of Appeal for Ontario.\nAfter trial, the learned trial judge, Moorhouse J., awarded to the plaintiff Marjorie Gorman the sum of $35,000 in general damages which with other damages resulted in judgment in her favour for $42,451.18, and awarded to the appellants in the second action who sued under the provisions of The Fatal Accidents Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 138, as executors of both the late Dr. William Hossack and his wife Mary Ann Hossack, the sum of $94,000 general damages which, with other damages, resulted in judgment in their favour in the sum of $95,632.60.\nWhether this Court is justified in varying the judgment of the court of appeal, which in turn had varied the damages awarded by the trial judge, has been dealt with in a considerable number of decisions of this Court and it may be taken that the jurisprudence has been established here. In Pratt v. Beaman[1], Anglin J. said at p. 287:\nThe second ground of appeal is that damages allowed for pain and suffering by the trial judge, $1,500, should not have been reduced as they were on appeal, to $500. While, if we were the first appellate court, we might have been disposed not to interfere with the assessment of these damages by the Superior Court, it is the well established practice of this court not to interfere with an amount allowed for damages, such as these, by the court of last resort in a province. That court is, as a general rule, in a much better position than we can be to determine a proper allowance having regard to local environment. It is, of course, impossible to say that the Court of King\u2019s Bench erred in principle in reducing these damages.\n(The italics are my own.)\nIn Hanes v. Kennedy[2], Kerwin J. said at pp. 387-8:\nWhere general damages fixed by a trial judge sitting without a jury have been reduced by a Court of Appeal under circumstances such as we find here, this Court, as a general rule, will not interfere: Ross v. Dunstall (1921), 62 Can. S.C.R. 393; Pratt v. Beaman, [1930] S.C.R. 284. Mr. Cartwright referred to McHugh v. Union Bank of Canada, [1913] A.C. 299 at 309\u2026no error in principle was made by the Court of Appeal in this case, and the cross-appeal should, therefore, be dismissed, with costs.\n(The italics are my own.)\nAnd again, in Lang et al. v. Pollard et al.[3], Kerwin J. said at p. 859:\n\u2026the same principle is applicable and that is, particularly in Canada where estimates of damages may differ in various Provinces, that this Court will not, except in very exceptional circumstances, interfere with the amounts fixed by the Court of Appeal where they differ from the damages assessed by trial judge.\n(The italics are my own.)\nIn Lehnert v. Stein[4], Cartwright J. said at p. 45:\nAs to the quantum of damages, this Court is slow to interfere with the amount fixed by a Provincial Appellate Court which has varied the assessment made by a trial judge. It is sufficient on this point to refer to the case of Lang et al., v. Pollard et al., [1957] S.C.R. 858. In the case at bar a perusal of the evidence brings me to the conclusion that the amount fixed by the Court of Appeal is not excessive.\nThe final authority to which I shall refer is Widrig v. Strazer et al.[5], where Hall J., giving the judgment of the Court, said at pp. 388-9:\nThe Court of Appeal reduced the trial judge\u2019s award of $40,000 to $12,000. The right of the Court of Appeal to review a trial judge\u2019s award is governed by well-settled principles as stated by Viscount Simon in Nance v. British Columbia Electric Railway Company Ld., [1951] A.C. 601 at 613, as follows:\nWhether the assessment of damages be by a judge or a jury, the appellate court is not justified in substituting a figure of its own for that awarded below simply because it would have awarded a different figure if it had tried the case at first instance. Even if the tribunal of first instance was a judge sitting alone, then, before the appellate court can properly intervene, it must be satisfied either that the judge, in assessing the damages, applied a wrong principle of law (as by taking into account some irrelevant factor or leaving out of account some relevant one); or, short of this, that the amount awarded is either so inordinately low or so inordinately high that it must be a wholly erroneous estimate of the damage.\nUnless there was error of principle on the part of the Court of Appeal, this Court will not interfere with an amount allowed for damages by the court of last resort in a province. I adopt what Cartwright J., speaking for himself and Taschereau J. (as he then was) said in Lang and Joseph v. Pollard and Murphy, [1957] S.C.R. 858 at 862:\nUnder these circumstances where no error of principle and no misapprehension of any feature of the evidence is indicated I think that the rule which we should follow is that stated by Anglin J., as he then was, giving the unanimous judgment of the Court, in Pratt v. Beaman [1930] S.C.R. 284 at 287:\n(see supra).\nThis decision was followed in the unanimous judgment of this Court, delivered by Kerwin J., as he then was, in Hanes et al. v. Kennedy et al., [1941] S.C.R. 384 at 387.\nThe principle appears to me to be equally applicable whether the first appellate court has increased or decreased the general damages awarded at the trial.\nIn my view there were errors of principle on the part of the Court of Appeal in reducing the amount of the damages...\nI have avoided citing the cases in which the court of appeal in the province had varied damages awarded by a jury. To summarize the jurisprudence established by this Court, this Court will not vary damages adjudged by the court of appeal in a province which had varied those assessed by the trial judge \u201cexcept in the most exceptional circumstances\u201d, and it would further appear that the so-called exceptional circumstances are those where this Court is of the opinion that the court of appeal had committed an error in principle.\nTherefore, I turn to examining the problem of whether the Court of Appeal in the present case did commit any errors in principle. The basis upon which a court of appeal is justified in varying the damages awarded by a trial judge, as the Court of Appeal for Ontario did in these cases, again, in my view, has been authoritatively decided by this Court. In Fagnan v. Ure et al.[6], Locke J. said at p. 385:\nThe findings of the learned trial judge as to the compensation to be awarded to the respondents have been approved by the unanimous judgment of the Appellate Division (1957), 22 W.W.R. 289, 9 D.L.R. (2d) 480.\nThe rule applicable when the matter was before that Court is as it is stated by Greer L.J. in Flint v. Lovell, [1935] K.B. 354 at 360, in the following terms:\nIn order to justify reversing the trial judge on the question of the amount of damages it will generally be necessary that this Court should be convinced either that the judge acted upon some wrong principle of law, or that the amount awarded was so extremely high or so very small as to make it, in the judgment of this Court, an entirely erroneous estimate of the damage to which the plaintiff is entitled.\nThat statement was approved by the House of Lords in Davies et al. v. Powell Duffryn Associated Collieries, Limited, [1942] A.C. 601 at 617, [1942] 1 All E.R. 657, and by the Judicial Committee in Nance v. British Columbia Electric Railway Company Limited, [1951] A.C. 601 at 613, [1951] 2 All E.R. 448, [1951] 3 D.L.R. 705, 2 W.W.R. (N.S.) 665, 67 C.R.T.C. 340.\nIn the latter case, Viscount Simon, delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee, said at p. 613:\nIn those circumstances two distinct questions arise:\u2014(1) What principles should be observed by an appellate court in deciding whether it is justified in disturbing the finding of the court of first instance as to the quantum of damages; more particularly when that finding is that of a jury, as in the present case. (2) What principles should govern the assessment of the quantum of damages by the tribunal of first instance itself.\n(1) The principles which apply under this head are not in doubt. Whether the assessment of damages be by a judge or a jury, the appellate court is not justified in substituting a figure of its own for that awarded below simply because it would have awarded a different figure if it had tried the case at first instance. Even if the tribunal of first instance was a judge sitting alone, then, before the appellate court can properly intervene, it must be satisfied either that the judge, in assessing the damages, applied a wrong principle of law (as by taking into account some irrelevant factor or leaving out of account some relevant one); or, short of this, that the amount awarded is either so inordinately low or so inordinately high that it must be a wholly erroneous estimate of the damage (Flint v. Lovell, [1935] 1 K.B. 354, approved by the House of Lords in Davies v. Powell Dufjryn Associated Collieries Ld., [1942] A.C. 601). The last named case further shows that when on a proper direction the quantum is ascertained by a jury, the disparity between the figure at which they have arrived and any figure at which they could properly have arrived must, to justify correction by a court of appeal, be even wider than when the figure has been assessed\u2019 by a judge sitting alone. The figure must be wholly \u201cout of all proportion\u201d (per Lord Wright, Davies v. Powell Duffryn Associated Collieries, Ld., [1942] A.C. 601, 616.)\nTherefore, it must be determined whether the trial judge in the present case applied a wrong principle of law or, short of that, that the amounts awarded by the trial judge were so inordinately high as to be a wholly erroneous estimate of the damage. Since the trial was before a judge without a jury I do not seek to apply the \u201cout of all proportion\u201d test of Lord Wright in Davies v. Powell Duffryn Associated Collieries Ld., supra.\nTHE GORMAN ACTION\nSchroeder J.A., giving the judgment of the Court of Appeal, said:\nWe have also come to the decision that the learned trial Judge\u2019s assessment of general damages in favour of the Respondent Marjorie Gorman is so excessive that it cannot be upheld. We reject the contention of her counsel that a separate assessment should be made in respect of each individual injury sustained by this Respondent. Viewing her injuries as a whole, we consider that an award of $22,500 for general damages would constitute reasonable compensation under that head. To that extent the appeal should be allowed and the judgment varied by substituting for the award of $35,000 for general damages the sum of $22,500.\nIt would appear, therefore, that the learned justice in appeal may well have considered (1) that the trial judge committed an error in principle in that he, acting upon the submission of counsel for the plaintiff Gorman, separately assessed damages for each injury and then totalled them, and (2) that in any event the award of $35,000 general damages was \u201cso inordinately high as to be a wholly erroneous estimate of the damages\u201d.\nTo deal with the first question, counsel for the plaintiff Gorman at trial appeared before this Court as counsel for her as appellant, and agreed that at trial in argument he had cited separate possible amounts of damages for each of his client\u2019s injuries as being appropriate if each of those injuries had been suffered by different individuals but he denied that he had urged the trial judge to total those individual amounts. Counsel, on the other hand, reported that he had urged the trial judge to take into account that all of the injuries had been suffered by one person and award a lump sum considering those injuries and the well recognized elements of future expenses, pain and suffering up to the trial and prospective pain and suffering thereafter, well-nigh total elimination of his client in the enjoyment of life, and the fact that a lady of 60 years of age would not be able to readjust herself to her infirmities as would a younger person.\nThe learned trial judge delivered reasons at the end of the trial in which he determined the issue of liability and reserved for further consideration the quantum of damages, then some weeks later endorsed the record with the amounts of his assessment. However, on delivering judgment at trial, he said:\nMrs. Gorman was an active woman and has been permanently crippled. She enjoyed driving about in her car, golfing, curling, and playing the piano. She feels that her ability to do these things has been completely taken away from her, and that her piano playing has been very seriously and permanently affected. In short, her enjoyment of life has been materially affected by this accident. I feel that it has.\nSome of the injuries which she received consisted of: Lacerations of the lower lip; bruises of the forehead; deep laceration of both knees into the joint; a comminuted fracture of the left patella; a chip fracture of the left femur near the joint; and her right ankle was almost severed. Swelling of the right hand, and there was a fracture of the metacarpal, near the wrist joint, and there was a fracture of the first left and the fourth matatarsal of the left foot; a fracture of the lower mandible; and numerous bruises and contusions. There were operations under general anaesthesia, and she had a cast from the groin to the foot, of both legs, and her jaws were wired because of the fractures, and she was obliged to take food through a tube. She had long and continuing physiotherapy.\nThe medical evidence is that at some time, the right ankle will require to be locked. It has been advised, but this Plaintiff has postponed that for as long as she thinks that she can. However, she will again have to. undergo surgery, and be for some few weeks in the hospital. The evidence is that the arthritic condition will be affected; she has had a large amount of dental work, and has undergone pain and suffering. These are factors, all of which have been mentioned by counsel, and if there are any that I have omitted, I simply have taken those from my notes of the evidence, and they will be considered when I endorse the record as to the amount of damages in her case, Mr. Houston.\nI find nothing in that statement to indicate that the learned trial judge was intending to or did total the individual amounts suggested by counsel in order to arrive at his award. The fact that the amounts suggested by counsel for the individual injuries do total approximately that awarded by the trial judge I regard as a mere coincidence and no conclusive indication that such a formula was used. Moreover, counsel for the respondent in this Court admitted that he was unable to cite any authority that such an \u201cadding machine approach\u201d to the assessment of damages was incorrect in principle. It would certainly be inept but even if it had been used by the trial judge, and I am of the opinion that has not been demonstrated, I cannot say that it would be wrong in principle.\nI turn next to the consideration of whether the award of $35,000 general damages was \u201cso inordinately high as to be a wholly erroneous estimate of the damages\u201d. I have already cited the learned trial judge\u2019s reference to the injuries. Counsel for the appellant in his factum has listed 16 different injuries of varying severity and importance. It seems certain that the appellant who, prior to the accident, was a lady of 60 years of age, one who drove her car constantly and engaged in active sports such as golf and curling, is now a permanently crippled person with, at any rate, a degree of fixity of both legs and with every indication that arthritis resulting from the injuries has already advanced to a considerable degree. The trial judge, called upon to consider these facts in the light of the elements of damages which I have already cited as having been submitted to him by the counsel for the appellant at trial could, in my view, have arrived at a figure of $35,000 for general damages without the award being such as to earn the description as being \u201cso inordinately high as to be a wholly erroneous estimate of damages\u201d. As Cartwright J. pointed out in Lehnart v. Stein, supra, one might only come to the determination of whether an award is \u201cso inordinately high\u201d by perusal of the evidence and I have summarized my perusal of that evidence in expressing the opinion above.\nTHE HOSSACK ACTION\nSchroeder J.A., giving the judgment of the Court of Appeal, said:\nI propose to deal first with the assessment of damages in the action brought under The Fatal Accidents Act. An Appellate Court does not readily interfere with an assessment of damages made by a trial Judge unless it is satisfied that the damages awarded are clearly unreasonable and unsupported by the evidence or that they are so excessively high as to be clearly erroneous. In our respectful view the award of $94,000 is so excessively high as to reflect an attempt to award an amount approaching a perfect compensation. There are numerous contingencies to be taken into account in assessing damages in these cases by reason whereof expectations of pecuniary benefit disappointed by a death caused by the act of a wrongdoer must be adequately discounted. The learned Judge failed, in our respectful opinion, to give full and proper effect to those contingencies. It is perfectly obvious that the actuarial evidence of Mr. Lang, based on the estimated savings of the deceased William Ross Hossack, did not take account of the fact that if the Respondents optimistic estimate of the accumulated savings were well founded, they would reach the hands of the beneficiaries subject to provincial succession duties tax and federal estate tax which would be substantial in an estate of half a million dollars. There are also many contingencies as, e.g., if the wife were to predecease the husband, and he were to remarry, or if the husband were to predecease the wife and she were to remarry, further that the wife might have been compelled to live on the husband\u2019s estate, in which event the question would arise as to how much of the said estate would remain on the wife\u2019s death. These and many other contingencies which need not be denominated exist in this case and must be given due effect.\nWe have had the benefit of very able, comprehensive and helpful arguments of counsel in the course of which the evidence was exhaustively reviewed. Upon full consideration we have attained to the conclusion that a proper award in favour of the infant under the provisions of The Fatal Accidents Act would be $65,000.00. To that extent the appeal should be allowed and the judgment in appeal varied by substituting for the sum of $94,000.00 the sum of $65,000.00.\nIt would appear, therefore, that the learned justice in appeal felt that the Court of Appeal was justified in varying the judgment of the learned trial judge for these reasons: (1) that the damages allowed reflected an attempt to award an amount approaching a perfect compensation, (2) that numerous contingencies to be taken into account in assessing damages in a fatal accidents case had not been taken into account, and (3) that the damages awarded were \u201cso inordinately high as to be a wholly erroneous estimate of damages\u201d.\nOne contingency to which the learned justice in appeal refers was that the actuary\u2019s estimate of the total estate which would have been left by the late Dr. William Ross Hossack had he lived out his life in a normal fashion would only have gone to his son after provincial succession duties and federal estate taxes had been deducted therefrom. A further contingency which the learned justice in appeal felt the trial judge had failed to consider was the possibility of Mrs. Hossack predeceasing her husband and he remarrying, or Dr. Hossack predeceasing his wife and she being forced during the balance of her lifetime to live on the estate of her late husband which had accumulated up to the date of his death, and so reduce the amount available for the infant son of the late Dr. and Mrs. Hossack and, therefore, the pecuniary benefit of which he was deprived by their untimely death. I think the second contingency may be dealt with very briefly. The fact is that Mrs. Hossack died in the accident which gave rise to this cause of action. The pecuniary benefit to her son, in whose interest the action is taken, as the result of any estate which she might have left had she lived out her ordinary life was slight and, therefore, what was in essence the trial judge\u2019s task was to determine the pecuniary benefit of which the son was deprived by the death in the accident of his father. The fact is that his father, the late Dr. Hossack, did not leave a widow who might live on the late Dr. Hossack\u2019s estate had he predeceased her at some future time. It might well be that the late Dr. Hossack, had he lived, might have remarried, but the effect of such remarriage on the pecuniary benefit which his son would receive on the date of his father\u2019s death, had it occurred under normal circumstances, and at a normal time, is altogether conjecture and I do not see how it could be allowed for with any intelligence in the affixing of the damages.\nI therefore find no error in principle in the learned trial judge\u2019s failure to consider this contingency, if he did so fail to consider it, and there is nothing in his reasons for judgment or in the endorsement of the record which indicated that he did fail to consider any proper element. It must be remembered that the learned trial judge said:\nI shall read the cases referred to by counsel and shall take into consideration all these factors required to be so taken into consideration and will endorse the record as to the amount of damages accordingly.\nThe question of the effect on the pecuniary benefit of which Brian Hossack was deprived by the untimely death of his parents, of the estate taxes, provincial and federal, is a matter of some importance. It would appear from a perusal of the evidence of Mr. Lang, the actuary, who gave evidence on behalf of the plaintiffs at trial, that this witness found a probable gross estate which would come to the son upon the death of Dr. Hossack had it occurred under ordinary circumstances of $503,000. After estate duties, federal and provincial, were deducted therefrom at their present rates, it would leave only a net estate of $364,500. Using the same calculation as Mr. Lang, that would have a present value of $81,885 rather than the present value of $113,000 which Mr. Lang calculated as being the present value of an estate of $503,000. However, it was counsel\u2019s submission that the learned trial judge appears to have made up his award of $94,000 by the addition of three amounts,\n(a) the present value of the probable future estate that Brian Hossack would have received upon the eventual passing of his father and mother under ordinary circumstances.......................................... $50,000.\n(b) the cost of food, clothing, shelter and education for a 20-year period which the infant Brian would have received from his parents if they had lived.............................................................................. $32,000.\n(c) the substantial loss suffered by the infant in losing the intellectual, moral and physical guidance and training which only a mother and father could give him.......................................................... $12,000.\nOn that basis, the trial judge reduced the $113,000 present value figure to which I have referred to $50,000 to allow for the many contingencies which might have interfered with the late Dr. Hossack leaving an estate as large as Mr. Lang calculated. That represents a reduction of 55.7 per cent. Had the present value been considered at $81,885, the reduction to $50,000 would only have represented a reduction to allow for the said contingencies of about 40 per cent. Had the reduction factor of approximately 56 per cent been used on the present value after such estate duties, then figure (a) in the calculation would have amounted to about $45,000 to $46,000 and added to figures (b) and (c) would have given a total damage award of about $90,000.\nI am unable to say that an award of $94,000 as damages under The Fatal Accidents Act is so inordinately higher than an award of $90,000 that it is a wholly erroneous estimate of the damages. There has been very considerable argument as to the propriety of both the $32,000 allowance under head (b) and the $12,000 allowance under (c) above. I am of the opinion that those objections constitute merely an attempt to supplant the estimate made by the trial judge with the estimate by the Court of Appeal or by counsel before this Court and that no matter of principle is involved. There is, however, an additional factor which must be considered and it is the factor which deals with the establishment of a gross value of the estate of the late Dr. Hossack, had he lived his ordinary life, at $503,000. That amount was arrived at by the witness Lang by assuming that the late Dr. Hossack would have saved one-third of his net income and that those savings accumulated with interest for the 38 years of his normal life would have amounted at his death at the end of those 38 years to $503,000. The estimate that the late Dr. Hossack had saved one-third of his income was made by finding that those so-called savings amounted to $16,319 and that his total net income after deduction of taxes was $44,994. The $16,319 was a total which included a valuation of household goods, furniture and jewellery at $2,642, and two automobiles at $1,120, a total of $3,782. Certainly, it is difficult to understand how those items could be included under the heading of \u201csavings\u201d so that their capitalization at 4 per cent interest would build up into a gross estate in 38 years of $503,000. This would lead us to the conclusion that the actuary was incorrect in taking as the basis for his calculation that the late Dr. Hossack was saving one-third of his net income. In fact, usual living expenses, i.e., the purchase of furniture, household goods, jewellery and automobiles were erroneously included in that so-called saving of one-third of his net income. The capitalization of these amounts would appear to make inaccurate the calculated gross estate of the late Dr. Hossack, at normal death, of $503,000, and it would appear more accurate to say that the late Dr. Hossack saved only about 28 per cent of his net income. His total savings therefore would not have been the $212,292 calculated by Mr. Lang but about $178,000 and that total saving capitalized on the 4 per cent basis used by Mr. Lang would have yielded a gross estate at the time of death of about $422,000. This estate, after the allowance of estate duties, federal and provincial, would amount to approximately $305,803.\nThe present value of $503,000 is $113,000 and the present value of $305,803, therefore, would be about $68,500. If you allow about 56 per cent of that as being a proper figure to allow for contingencies you would reach an amount not of the $50,000 as apparently allowed by the learned trial judge but rather about $38,360 and if to that amount, as being the proper amount for category (a) supra, you add the same amounts for category (b)\u2014$32,000, and category (c)\u2014$12,000, you arrive at $82,360.\nTherefore, in my judgment, the proper allowance for damages under The Fatal Accidents Act should have been $82,360. In arriving at that figure, I believe that I have used the method of calculation adopted by the appellants and to which no objection was taken by counsel for the respondents, but I have based my calculation of the gross estate which the late Dr. Hossack might have expected to leave, had he died at a normal time and under normal circumstances, upon a more realistic estimate of his accumulated savings, and I have made allowance for the effect of estate duties, federal and provincial, which it would appear the learned trial judge, if he adopted the calculations made by Mr. Lang, failed to allow. In short, I have attempted to correct the two matters of principle upon which the trial judge seems to have fallen in error.\nIn doing so, I do not purport to deal with the question discussed in British Transport Commission v. Gourley[7], or in Jennings v. Cronsberry[8], as to whether or not deductions should be made in damage awards to a person who had been injured and thereby prevented from earning his living for, at any rate, a period of time to allow for tax on income which he would otherwise have earned. What must be determined in an action under The Fatal Accidents Act is the pecuniary benefit of which the person for whom the action has been instituted is deprived by the untimely death of the deceased. That pecuniary benefit, in my view, must be considered in the light of what such person will actually receive. What he actually will receive is the net estate after the deduction of estate duties and, therefore, an allowance must be made for the death duties in calculating the damages.\nI am, therefore, of the opinion that this Court should allow the appeal in the Gorman action and restore the judgment of the trial judge. Since the appellant in the Gorman action was successful throughout, the appellant should have costs at trial, in the Court of Appeal, and in this Court.\nThis Court, by virtue of s. 46 of the Supreme Court Act, may \u201cgive the judgment and award the process or other proceedings that the Court whose decision is appealed against, should have given or awarded\u201d.\nI would allow the appeal in the Hossack action to the extent of varying the general damages from the sum of $65,000, as fixed in the Court of Appeal, to $82,360 Which with other damages of $1,632.60 allowed at trial will result in a judgment in favour of the plaintiffs in that action for $83,992.60. Since the appellant in the Hossack action did not succeed in having restored the judgment at trial, I would leave in effect the disposition of costs made in the Court of Appeal, and I would allow no costs in this Court.\nAppeal allowed with costs, JUDSON J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Soloway, Wright, Houston, Galligan & McKimm, Ottawa.\nSolicitors for the defendants, respondents: Walker, Milton, Rice & Ellis, Toronto.\n[1] [1930] S.C.R. 284.\n[2] [1941] S.C.R. 384.\n[3] [1957] S.C.R. 858.\n[4] [1963] S.C.R. 38.\n[5] [1964] S.C.R. 376.\n[6] [1958] S.C.R. 377.\n[7] [1956] A.C. 185.\n[8] [1965] 2 O.R. 285 (CA.).\n",

The tower was to be delivered to M Ltd. to be its absolute property for and in consideration of the payment, on such delivery, by M Ltd. to A Co. of the sum of $39,200. Under the agreement the respondent was to subscribe for 39,200 preference shares of M Ltd. of a par value of $1 each. The president of A Co. and his associate were to transfer their interest in the patent rights for the tower to M Ltd. and in return were each to receive 19,600 preference shares. An advance of $30,000 toward the cost of building the tower was made by the respondent to A Co. on May 10, 1957.\nThe tower was a part of the property described in a policy of insurance taken out by the respondent on June 19, 1957. It was destroyed while being towed into place on July 25 before it had been delivered by A Co. to M Ltd. or to anyone else. The question raised was whether at the time when the insurance was effected and at the time of its destruction, the respondent had an insurable interest in the tower so as to entitle it to recover for the loss under the terms of the policy. The trial judge and the majority of the Court of Appeal found that the respondent had an insurable interest in the tower consisting of \u201ca right derivable out of some contract about the property\u201d.\nHeld (Cartwright and Judson JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.\nPer Martland J.: The respondent did not have any insurable interest in the tower but even assuming that it had, such interest would have been that of a buyer to whom neither risk nor property had passed. If this gave ground for any insurance to be validly effected by the assured, it would have been for insurance on that interest and not on the property. Consequently, even if an interest did exist in the respondent, it was not such an interest as was insured under the policy in question. Per Martland and Ritchie JJ.: It was not shown that there existed, either at the time when the insurance was applied for or at the time of loss, such a contract between the respondent and A Co. in respect of the tower under construction as conferred on the respondent an interest in it which a court of law or equity would recognize and enforce.\nThe agreement of April 29, 1957, contained no reference to delivery of the tower to the respondent by A Co., nor was there any provision for payment by the respondent; the tower was to be delivered to M Ltd. and it was the company which was to pay the purchase price. The respondent held no interest in the patent for the tower design except in its capacity as a potential shareholder of M Ltd. The advance of $30,000 was not made in part performance of any contractual obligation of the respondent to A Co.; it was made on behalf of M Ltd. to be credited by that company against the respondent\u2019s obligation to pay for its shares of M Ltd.\nThe respondent in effect was seeking from its insurers the recoupment of the loss which it sustained when it did not receive back the $30,000. A loan not secured by a lien or charge on the insured property did not give rise to an insurable interest therein and even if the $30,000 received by A Co. were to be treated as a loan made by the respondent on its own behalf, it was in no way secured by any lien or charge on the tower.\nClark v. Scottish Imperial Insurance Co. (1879), 4 S.C.R. 192; Macaura v. Northern Assurance Co. Ltd. et al., [1925] A.C. 619, referred to.\nPer Spence J.: In the circumstances, the respondent\u2019s only interest in the tower was that of a shareholder in M Ltd., or an investor entitled to have issued to it shares for which it had paid in part, such payment having been used in part payment for the completion of the tower. Such a result would not give to the respondent the direct relationship to the property in the tower to constitute an insurable interest.\nPer Cartwright and Judson JJ., dissenting: The question whether the respondent had a right derivable out of a contract about the tower which would be enforced by a court of equity could be tested by considering what the situation would have been if the tower had not been destroyed but A Co. had announced that it was going to deliver it to a stranger who had offered a better price. M Ltd. would have had no cause of action against A Co. for it was not a party to the contract with that company. The contractual situation was that the respondent (and others) had a contract with A Co. whereby the latter was bound to construct the tower and deliver it to M Ltd.; the consideration moving to A Co. was the sum of $39,200 and the respondent had paid $30,000 of this to A Co. The manner in which this payment was to be accounted for and dealt with as between the respondent and M Ltd. was irrelevant. The tower being a chattel which could not readily be replaced, equity, at the suit of the respondent, would grant specific performance and compel the delivery of the tower to M Ltd. Accordingly, the respondent had an insurable interest in the tower at all relevant times.\nThe defence that even if the respondent did have an insurable interest in the tower that interest was not adequately described in the policy was not open to the appellants. The issue to be tried was limited to the question whether the respondent had an insurable interest in the tower. If it had it was entitled to succeed, if it had not its action must fail. APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming a judgment of McRuer C.J.H.C. Appeal allowed, Cartwright and Judson JJ. dissenting.\nW.B. Williston, Q.C., and R.J. Rolls, for the defendants, appellants.\nJ.J. Gray, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of Cartwright and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):\u2014The relevant facts and the course of the proceedings in the Courts below are set out in the reasons of my brother Ritchie.\nI have reached the conclusion that the appeal fails.\nI am in substantial agreement with the reasons of McRuer C.J.H.C. and particularly with the summary of his views, concurred in by the majority in the Court of Appeal, which he expressed as follows:\nTo summarize my views, without going beyond the special facts of this case I think the plaintiff had an insurable interest in the tower both at the time the contract of insurance was entered into and when the loss occurred because, (1) the construction of the tower was ordered by the plaintiff and Bodi and Bowland; (2) it was being constructed in the development of an invention in which the plaintiff had an interest under its contract with Bodi and Bowland; (3) the tower was for a specific purpose and as part of the drilling operations of the plaintiff; (4) the plaintiff had advanced $30,000 to further its construction; and (5) at the time the loss occurred there had been no corporate act on the part of Marine Drilling Towers Limited to affect the plaintiff\u2019s interest or its liability.\nIf I am correct in these findings the plaintiff has \u201ca right derivable out of (a) contract about the property.\u201d\nIn my opinion, the question whether the respondent had a right derivable out of a contract about the tower which would be enforced by a court of equity may be tested by considering what the situation would have been if the tower had not been destroyed but Accurate Machine and Tool Company Limited, hereinafter referred to as \u201cAccurate\u201d, had announced that it was going to deliver it to a stranger who had offered a better price. It seems clear that Marine Drilling Towers Limited, hereinafter referred to as \u201cMarine\u201d, would have had no cause of action against \u201cAccurate\u201d for it was not a party to the contract with that company. The contractual situation was that the respondent (and others) had a contract with \u201cAccurate\u201d whereby the latter was bound to construct the tower and deliver it to \u201cMarine\u201d; the consideration moving to \u201cAccurate\u201d was the sum of $39,200 and the respondent had paid $30,000 of this to \u201cAccurate\u201d. The manner in which this payment was to be accounted for and dealt with as between the respondent and \u201cMarine\u201d appears to me to be irrelevant. The tower being a chattel which could not readily be replaced, equity, at the suit of the respondent, would grant specific performance and compel the delivery of the tower to \u201cMarine\u201d.\nIn these circumstances it is my opinion that the respondent had an insurable interest in the tower at all relevant times.\nIt remains to mention the second ground on which Kelly J.A. would have allowed the appeal which is that even if the respondent did have an insurable interest in the tower that interest was not adequately described in the policy.\nIn my opinion in view of the way in which the trial proceeded this defence is not open to the appellants. At the trial Mr. Gray appeared for the respondent and Mr. Smiley for the appellants. At the commencement of the trial before any witness was called the record reads as follows:\nHIS LORDSHIP: I thought from the pleadings that it indicated that it was construction of the policies, whether the loss fell within the policies or not.\nMR SMILEY: My lord, I will concede this, that if they have an insurable interest, and I make a judicial admission, then they are entitled to recover to the extent of their interest. I don\u2019t deny that.\nMy sole defence is that the evidence\u2014may I retract the word \u201csole\u201d\u2014my major defence, my lord, is that on the evidence and the facts as we know them the plaintiff did not have an insurable interest in this tower under the policies of insurance which were issued.\nHIS LORDSHIP: Well then, with that statement, Mr. Gray, probably you should direct your evidence to establishing your insurable interest.\nLater in the trial, while Mr. Gray was examining an officer of the company which had signed the policy as authorized representative of the insuring companies with the apparent purpose of establishing that all the circumstances were disclosed to him at the time the policy was applied for, Mr. Smiley made the following objection:\nMR SMILEY: My lord, may I say that to this line of evidence I would take objection. There is no suggestion here that we were not bound to the extent of insurable interest. I suggest, with deference, that it is a collateral issue. There is no doubt as to how McRuer C.J.H.C. understood these statements. In his reasons for judgment after setting out the facts he said:\nThe case for the defendant is placed on the sole ground that on these facts the plaintiff had no insurable interest in the tower in question at the time the policy was written or at the time the tower was destroyed.\nThe words used by counsel for the appellants do not appear to me to be open to any construction other than that placed upon them by the learned Chief Justice. The issue to be tried was limited to the question whether the respondent had an insurable interest in the tower. If it had it was entitled to succeed, if it had not its action must fail.\nHaving reached the conclusion, for the reasons stated by McRuer C.J.H.C. and those briefly set out above, that the respondent had an insurable interest it follows that in my opinion the appeal fails.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014I agree with my brother Ritchie and also with the reasons delivered by Kelly J.A. in the Court of Appeal, whose conclusions are summarized in the following paragraph:\nIn my opinion, the assured has not proven that it had any insurable interest of a nature which it purported to insure under the terms of the policy in question. I do not consider that it had any insurable interest whatsoever but even assuming that it had, the insurable interest which it had would have been that of a buyer to whom neither risk nor property had passed. If this gave ground for any insurance to be validly effected by the assured, it would have been for insurance on that interest and not on the property. Consequently, even if an interest did exist in Aqua-Land, it was not in such an interest as was insured under the policy in question.\nIn my opinion the appellants were not precluded from relying upon the alternative ground stated at the end of the quoted paragraph.\nMy brother Cartwright has quoted the statement made by counsel for the appellants at the commencement of the trial. Counsel then stated that his major defence was that \u201cthe plaintiff did not have an insurable interest in this tower under the policies of insurance which were issued\u201d I understand this to mean that it was contended that the respondent did not have any interest in the tower which was insurable under the terms of the policy of insurance which was in issue.\nVery shortly after this statement was made by counsel, and still during the discussion between the Court and counsel before the evidence was commenced, the learned trial judge stated to counsel for the respondent:\nI think I can decide that, Mr. Gray. We will decide whether you have an insurable interest under the policy. I will have to decide if you have insurable interest and what the insurable interest is.\nThe objection taken by counsel for the appellants to the question being put by counsel for the respondent to Mr. Garfat, which is quoted by my brother Cartwright, was with respect to the following question:\nNow then, what is the standing of your firm as to power to bind the insurance companies?\nCounsel for the appellants then said:\nMy lord, may I say that to this line of evidence I would take objection. There is no suggestion here that we were not bound to the extent of insurable interest. I suggest, with deference, that it is a collateral issue.\nThe learned Chief Justice then said:\nThe policy speaks for itself. You cannot vary the terms of the policy by oral evidence.\nI would dispose of this appeal in the manner proposed by my brother Ritchie.\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014This is an appeal brought with leave of this Court from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of Ontario[2] (Kelly J.A. dissenting) affirming the judgment at trial rendered by McRuer C.J.H.C. whereby he ordered that the respondent should recover $7,500 from each of Canada Security Assurance Company and The Guarantee Company of North America, and $3,750 from each of the other appellants in respect of a claim for the destruction of a drilling tower made pursuant to the terms of a policy of insurance dated June 19, 1957, whereby the appellants bound themselves \u201cseverally but not jointly\u201d to insure the respondent against \u201cdirect loss or damage\u201d, as provided in the policy, to property which was described as follows:\nOn property of every description pertaining to the Assured\u2019s drilling operations on Structure No. 2, consisting principally but not limited to Casings, Pipe Equipment, Compressors, Hydraulic Jacks, Tools, Platforms, Binoculars, Cabins, Camp Supplies and Equipment, the property of the Assured or the Property of others for which the assured may be responsible, including personal effects of the Assured\u2019s employees with a limit of $500.00, subject to a limit of $100.00 per employee.\nAlthough the total amount of the judgment appealed from was $30,000, the recovery against each appellant was for a sum less than $10,000 and the respondent moved to quash the appeal invoking the provisions of s. 36(a) of the Supreme Court Act whereby the right to appeal to this Court is limited to judicial proceedings \u201cwhere the amount or value of the matter in controversy in the appeal exceeds ten thousand dollars\u201d.\nIt has been settled since the case of Glen Falls Insurance Company et al. v. Adams[3] that when two or more insurance companies have been sued in one action on separate policies and seek to appeal to this Court, the appeal of each is a distinct and separate appeal in which the matter in controversy is its own liability and nothing else. In the present case, although there is only one policy, the liability is several and it was accordingly found to be necessary for the present appellants to apply for leave to appeal pursuant to the provisions of s. 41(1) of the Supreme Court Act. Upon consideration such leave was granted.\nThe respondent is a company which at all times material hereto was engaged in the business of drilling for oil and gas at Lake Erie where it carried on its activities from drilling platforms built from the surface of the ground to the surface of the lake, and for this purpose it had employed at least one conventional drilling tower constructed by Accurate Machine and Tool Company Limited (hereinafter referred to as \u201cAccurate Machine\u201d).\nIn the month of September 1956, after the close of the drilling season, George Bodi, who was the president of Accurate Machine, and his associate, J.A. Bowland, approached James Paxton, who was the vice-president of the respondent company, and discussed with him the construction of a new type of drilling tower of which they had the plans and patent rights, and which they claimed would revolutionize drilling operations at Lake Erie. The respondent company was genuinely interested in this new design and after prolonged discussions, lasting from September 1956 until April 1957, an agreement was finally executed on April 29, 1957, between the respondent, Bodi and Bowland under the terms of which a new company, Marine Drilling Towers Limited (hereinafter referred to as \u201cMarine Drilling\u201d) was to be incorporated for the purpose (inter alia) of taking delivery from Accurate Machine of a drilling tower of the new type which had already been partially constructed by that company.\nIt is common ground that the new tower was a part of the property described in the policy of insurance taken out by the respondent on June 19 and that it was destroyed while being towed into place on Lake Erie on July 25 before it had been delivered by Accurate Machine to Marine Drilling or to anyone else. The question to be determined on this appeal is whether at the time when the insurance was effected and at the time of its destruction, the respondent had an insurable interest in the tower so as to entitle it to recover for the loss under the terms of the policy.\nAt the outset of the proceedings at trial, the appellants\u2019 counsel, referring to the respondent as \u201cthey\u201d, made the following admission:\nMy lord, I will concede this that if they have an insurable interest, and I make a judicial admission, then they are entitled to recover to the extent of their interest, I don\u2019t deny that.\nThe leading authorities defining the nature of an insurable interest have been referred to in the judgments in the Courts below and it appears to me that they are well summarized in MacGillivray on Insurance Law, 5th ed., at pp. 219 and 220, where it is said:\nInsurable interest in property is not confined to the absolute legal ownership. Generally, any person who is so situated that he will suffer loss as the proximate result of damage to or destruction of the property has an insurable interest in it. But there must be some direct relationship to the property itself, for otherwise the interest is too remote and therefore not insurable. In Lucena v. Craufurd [(1806), 2 Bos. & Pul. (N.R.) 269] Lord Eldon said, \u2018I am unable to point out what is an interest unless it be a right in the property or a right derivable out of some contract about the property,\u2019 and if we add to this, \u2018or some legal liability to make good the loss\u2019, we get a substantially accurate definition of insurable interest in property.\n(The italics are my own.)\nThe nature of the insurable interest claimed by the respondent is described in para. 6 of the statement of claim as follows:\nOn or about the 29th day of April, 1957 the plaintiff agreed to participate jointly with George Bodi and J.A. Bowland to patent and to complete the construction of a type of marine drilling tower, known as a Mark V Tower and on or about the 10th day of May, 1957 the plaintiff, pursuant to arrangements with the said Bodi and the said Bowland, advanced to Accurate Machine & Tool Company Limited, the fabricator of the said Tower, the sum of $30,000.00 toward the cost of fabrication thereof. The character of the claim is also apparent from the terms of the revised proof of loss which reads:\n...the drilling platform referred to...was at the time of the loss owned by Accurate Machine & Tool Company Ltd. but the assured had an insurable interest by reason of its monetary interest in platform;...\n(The italics are my own.)\nThe monetary interest referred to is a cheque for $30,000 given by the respondent to Accurate Machine on May 10, 1957, under circumstances which will be hereinafter described and it was this advance to which the respondent\u2019s vice-president referred when he said in the course of his examination-in-chief:\nWe were insuring the interest of Aqua-Land which was indicated by the monies that had been advanced and by the exhibits here.\nThe learned trial judge and the majority of the Court of Appeal found that the respondent had an insurable interest in the tower in question consisting of \u201ca right derivable out of some contract about the property\u201d, and Mr. Justice Schroeder expressly found that:\nIn the present case the plaintiff was a purchaser of the property insured who had advanced more than three-fourths of the builder\u2019s stipulated consideration.\nThe kind of contractual right which is recognized at law as creating an insurable interest was discussed in the case of Clark v. Scottish Imperial Insurance Company[4] where this Court considered a claim made under an insurance policy taken out by one Clark on a vessel being built by a shipbuilder named Bishop with whom Clark had an arrangement that if he (Clark) would make the necessary advances to enable the vessel to be built, he would be in a position to look to the vessel when completed as security for his advances. The advances were therefore made on the security of the vessel and on the faith of the agreement between the parties. On completion the vessel was to be delivered to Clark for sale and he was to be recompensed out of the proceeds. The vessel was destroyed by fire when only partially built.\nIn the course of delivering the judgment of the majority of the Court, which held that Clark had an insurable interest, Ritchie C.J. said:\nThe contract of insurance being a contract of indemnity, it is abundantly clear that the plaintiff must establish some interest in the subject-matter insured. The questions we have to determine are, what constitutes such an insurable interest? And did the verbal agreement and the advances made on the strength of it, confer on Clark an insurable interest in the vessel while in course of construction?\nAs to the first, it is easily answered, negatively, that an insurable interest is not confined to a strict legal right of property; and, affirmatively, that any interest which would be recognized by a Court of Law or Equity is an insurable interest, or, as Mr. Bunyon thus sums up the question (Bunyon on Fire Insurance p. 8) \u2018that any legal or equitable estate or right which may be prejudicially affected, or any responsibility which may be brought into operation by a fire will confer an insurable interest,\u2019 There must therefore be a valid subsisting contract, susceptible of being enforced between the parties themselves, in order to constitute an insurable interest, or right of action against the insurer, not a mere expectancy or probable interest, however well founded. Was there, then, in this case such an existing contract between Clark and Bishop, in respect to this vessel in course of construction, as conferred on Clark an interest in it binding in law or equity, which a Court of Law or Equity would recognize and enforce, and which interest was prejudicially affected by the fire?\nIn conformity with this decision it appears to me that the question to be answered is whether there was such an existing contract between the respondent and Accurate Machine in respect to the tower under construction as conferred on the respondent an interest in it which a court of law or equity would recognize and enforce.\nIn the course of being questioned as to the negotiations between the respondent, Bodi (the president of Accurate Machine) and Bowland, during the months preceding the signing of the agreement, the attention of Mr. Paxton, the respondent\u2019s vice-president, was drawn to the April 29th agreement and he was asked:\nQ. Do I take it that this agreement after these extensive negotiations that you refer to, the agreement that you arrived at, was intended to be expressed in this document?\nA. Yes.\nAt a later stage, Mr. Paxton was asked:\nQ. It has been stated that Aqua-Land instructed the building of the tower. Did you have anything to do with the instructions given by Aqua-Land to build the tower?\nA. I do not recall them as instructions from Aqua-Land. I don\u2019t recall them as being specific instructions. It was by agreement where we would meet and say all right we are going to construct the thing but I have no recollection of any specific instructions having been given by Aqua-Land.\nQ. Does this mean the instructions were given by the group, rather than\u2014\nA. That\u2019s right. It was an agreement by the partners, Aqua-Land, Bodi and Mr. Bowland. The only agreement between Aqua-Land, Bodi and Bowland in respect to the tower of which there is any direct evidence is that expressed in the agreement of April 29, 1957, and I adopt the view expressed by Kelly J.A. in the course of his dissenting opinion in the Court of Appeal where he said:\nThe decision to proceed by the incorporation of Marine and the careful spelling out of the relationship to Marine of each of the parties to the agreement of 29th April, 1957, is a denial of the existence of any obligation to each other or to any one else save what has been written into the agreement. Consequently, I infer that no such legal relationship existed prior to 29th April, 1957, and thereafter the relationship was solely that to be found in the agreement.\nBy that agreement Bodi and Bowland each agreed to subscribe for 250 common shares of the capital stock of Marine Drilling while the respondent was to subscribe for 500 such shares. It was further provided that the respondent was to subscribe for 39,200 preference shares of a par value of $1 each which were to be paid for \u201cforthwith after the incorporation of Marine Drilling\u201d. Bodi and Bowland on their part agreed that they would each transfer to Marine \u201call (their) right, title and interest in and to the plans and patent rights of the Mark V tower and the said invention and any improvements thereto\u201d and in return they were each to receive 19,600 preference shares. Clause 5(6) of the agreement provides as follows:\nThe parties hereto agree that forthwith after the incorporation of Marine Drilling they shall ensure that Marine Drilling shall enter into an agreement with Accurate Machine & Tool Company Limited under which the latter shall forthwith construct a Mark V Tower in accordance with the specifications set out in Schedule \u2018A\u2019 hereto and deliver the same to Marine Drilling to be its absolute property for and in consideration of the payment, on such delivery, by Marine Drilling to Accurate Machine and Tool Company Limited of the sum of $39,200.\nThe agreement contains no reference to delivery of the tower to Aqua-Land by Accurate Machine, nor is there any provision for payment by the respondent. It is true that when the insurance was effected and at the time of the loss Marine Drilling had not exercised any of its corporate powers but it was in existence as a separate legal entity and it was the company which was to pay the purchase price and to which the tower was, on completion, to be delivered as its absolute property.\nIt remains to consider the circumstances under which the sum of $30,000 was advanced to Accurate Machine on May 10. There is no doubt that on that day the respondent issued a cheque for the amount in question bearing the notation \u201cRe Loan to Marine Equipment\u201d, the stub of which was endorsed: \u201cAccurate Machine advance $30,000\u201d.\nThe position at that time was that the construction of the tower was well advanced and that it was to be delivered to Marine Drilling and paid for by that company which had at that time been incorporated but was not yet in business and had no funds with which to pay for it. The respondent had agreed to pay $39,200 for 39,200 shares of Marine Drilling which had not yet been issued to it, and it appears to me to be clear from the respondent\u2019s own evidence that the advance of $30,000 to Accurate Machine was made on behalf of Marine Drilling to be credited by that company against the respondent\u2019s obligation to pay for its shares. This is borne out by the evidence of the respondent\u2019s secretary, Mr. Gerald Kirby, who said:\nQ. If that is so, then at the time you advanced the money, and you showed \u201cRe Loan to Marine Drilling\u201d, the money was advanced by way of an advance on your obligation to buy shares in Marine Drilling?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And that is why you showed \u201cRe Loan to Marine Drilling\u201d, because you hadn\u2019t purchased the share certificates at the time you issued the cheque?\nA. Actually Aqua-Land should never have issued a cheque to Accurate Machine & Tool.\nQ. Nevertheless you did. We are trying to find out Aqua-Land\u2019s interest in this matter; that is what we are aiming at. That is perhaps the bone of contention, I guess, among all of us. But if I follow you then, the cheque was written by way of an advance or a credit against your obligation to buy shares in Marine Drilling?\nA. Yes.\nQ. But instead of being sent to Marine Drilling or put in Marine Drilling\u2019s bank account, for it to be opened and a new one issued to Accurate Machine, you sent the cheque directly to Accurate Machine?\nA. That is correct.\nOn the same subject the respondent\u2019s vice-president, Mr.Paxton, stated:\nQ. Mr. Bodi has said that the $30,000 that was paid by Aqua-Land to\nAccurate was a progress payment on the tower?\nA. That is true.\nQ. Made by Aqua-Land?\nA. Made by Aqua-Land on behalf of Marine Drilling Towers in the future. HIS LORDSHIP: Q. Well, Marine Drilling Towers was in existence at\nthat time?\nA. Just the charter, that is all, sir.\nQ. Well, it was in existence?\nA. That\u2019s right. MR. GRAY: Q. Mr. Bodi has said that Aqua-Land still owes Accurate $9,200 on the construction of the tower?\nA. That is true.\nHIS LORDSHIP: Q. IS that strictly accurate?\nA. On the fulfillment of the delivery of the tower and the completion of the terms of the agreement, my lord.\nQ. Would it not be that Marine Drilling owed $9,200 and Aqua-Land would owe Marine Drilling that amount on the balance of their subscription for stock?\nA. All right; yes, my lord.\n(The italics are my own.)\nFor some months after it was made, the advance of $30,000 was carried on the respondent\u2019s books as a loan to Accurate Machine and there was some discussion of taking legal action to recover it.\nIt appears to me to be pertinent to note that Accurate Machine had insured the tower with its own insurers and in due course filed a proof of loss which stated that:\nIt (the tower) was at the time of the accident owned outright by Accurate Machine and Tool Company Limited free of any lien or encumbrance.\nPursuant to this claim a settlement was reached by Accurate Machine with its insurers based on the total cost to it of the building of the tower.\nI agree with Kelly J.A. that what the respondent is now seeking from its insurers \u201cis the recoupment of the loss which it sustained when it did not receive back the $30,000 for which a cheque had been given to Accurate Machine\u201d.\nIt is clear from the decision of the House of Lords in Macaura v. Northern Assurance Company Limited and Others[5], that a loan which is not secured by a lien or charge on the insured property does not give rise to an insurable interest therein and even if the $30,000 received by Accurate Machine were to be treated as a loan made by the respondent on its own behalf, it was in no way secured by any lien or charge on the tower. It is equally plain that the respondent\u2019s position as one entitled to become a shareholder of Marine Drilling could not give it an insurable interest in property in which that company was interested. It is contended, however, that the advance of $30,000 was made by the respondent by way of part performance of a contract to purchase the tower and, as I have indicated, the majority of the Court of Appeal appear to agree with this contention.\nWith the greatest respect for those who hold a different view, the conclusion that the respondent was the purchaser of the tower appears to me to leave out of account the reality of the position assigned to Marine Drilling under the terms of the agreement of April 29. It was clearly contemplated by that agreement that Marine Drilling was to be the purchaser of the tower and it was upon this basis that the respondent agreed to become interested in the matter at all.\nMarine Drilling was in fact incorporated, as the respondent\u2019s president has said:\n...for the purpose of owning and possessing not only the tower that was under construction, but other towers that were to be developed and would be manufactured, fabricated and would function as a company for the purpose of making available to the operators in Lake Erie this type of tower for the purpose of drilling for gas.\nIt was a term of the agreement of April 29 that \u201cForthwith after the issue of the common and preference shares\u201d, the original parties to the agreement would transfer 15,680 preference and 200 common shares to G.R. Johnson of Radar Exploration Co. who was to become a director and it is otherwise apparent that it was contemplated by all concerned that Marine Drilling would operate on a large scale as a distributor of the new towers to all those engaged in drilling for oil in Lake Erie.\nThe fact that at the time of the loss Marine Drilling had not issued any shares except to its incorporators and had not otherwise engaged in corporate business does not, as I have said, detract from its existence as a separate legal entity, and the fact that the respondent was to become one of its substantial shareholders and with Bodi and Bowland was to ensure that it agreed to take delivery of the tower and pay for it, does not, in my view, serve to identify the respondent with Marine Drilling under the contract so as to cast it in the role of a purchaser of the insured property.\nThe full implications of the view adopted by Mr. Justice Schroeder become apparent from the penultimate paragraph of his reasons for judgment where he said:\n...had the loss not occurred and had the Mark V tower been completed as contemplated by the agreement, and had Accurate Machine and Tool Company Limited then attempted to divert it to alien purposes to the detriment of the plaintiffs claim, a Court of equity would have interposed at the plaintiff\u2019s instance and would have compelled Accurate Machine and Tool Company Limited to carry out its side of the agreement upon payment or tender of the balance of $9,200.00, by placing the tower in the hands of the plaintiff and its associates in the venture. Manifestly, it would be fraudulent for Accurate Machine and Tool Company Limited to refuse to perform its obligation under the agreement after such substantial part performance on the plaintiff\u2019s part, having special regard to the fact that its design was the subject of a patent in which the plaintiff held an interest.\n(The italics are my own.)\nWith the greatest respect, as I have indicated, I take the view that the obligation of Accurate Machine upon payment of the agreed purchase price for the tower was not to place it \u201cin the hands of the plaintiff and its associates in the venture\u201d, but was to deliver it to Marine Drilling, and it appears to me also that the respondent held no interest in the patent for the tower design except in its capacity as a potential shareholder of Marine Drilling. It will appear also from what I have said that I do not consider the advance of May 10 to have been made in part performance of any contractual obligation of the respondent to Accurate Machine.\nIn the Courts below significance was attached to the fact that the plaintiff had placed its tools on the platform of the tower under some arrangement which was not developed in the evidence. Although this may be some evidence that the respondent intended to make use of the tower, I do not consider it to be in itself in any way decisive of the question of whether or not the respondent had an insurable interest in the insured property.\nIn view of all the above, it will be seen that I am not satisfied that there existed, either at the time when the insurance was applied for or at the time of the loss such a contract between the respondent and Accurate Machine in respect of the tower under construction as conferred on the respondent an interest in it which a court of law or equity would recognize and enforce. I am accordingly of opinion that the respondent has failed to discharge the burden of showing that it had an insurable interest in the property insured. In this regard I also adopt the reasoning contained in the dissenting opinion of Kelly J.A. in the Court of Appeal. I would allow this appeal and direct that the judgment of the Court of Appeal and of the learned trial judge be set aside.\nThe appellants will have their costs in this Court and in the Courts below.\nSPENCE J.:\u2014I have had the privilege of reading the reasons of my brothers Cartwright and Ritchie. With respect I concur with the view of the former, that the defence that the interest of the respondent was not adequately described in the policy, was not open to the appellants and I have nothing to add to what has been said by Mr. Justice Cartwright thereon.\nHowever, I concur with the opinion of Mr. Justice Ritchie that the respondent has failed to discharge the burden of showing that it had an insurable interest in the property insured. Since Mr. Justice Ritchie has reviewed the facts in detail and quoted excerpts from the evidence which I find relevant, I shall not repeat them. It would seem that as of April 29, 1957, the whole agreement between Aqua-Land, Bodi and Bowland was contained in that document. As Mr. Justice Ritchie has pointed out, that agreement in clause 5(6) provides:\nThe parties hereto agree that forthwith after the incorporation of Marine Drilling they shall ensure that Marine Drilling shall enter into an agreement with Accurate Machine & Tool Company Limited under which the latter shall forthwith construct a Mark V Tower in accordance with the specifications set out in Schedule \u2018A\u2019 hereto and deliver the same to Marine Drilling to be its absolute property for and in consideration of the payment, on such delivery, by Marine Drilling to Accurate Machine and Tool Company Limited of the sum of $39,200.\nWhat occurred thereafter? Mr. Paxton in his evidence, quoted by Mr. Justice Ritchie in his reasons, testified that no formal instructions were given thereafter as to the completion of the tower but that the parties, i.e., Aqua-Land and Bodi and Bowland, would meet and say \u201cAll right we are going to construct the thing\u201d and further agreed that instructions were given by this group. In my view, that conduct did not constitute an order of purchase by Aqua-Land any more than it did by Bodi or Bowland. It was simply a carrying out of the agreement contained in the said clause 5(6) of the agreement of April 29, 1957. The three were seeing that Accurate Machine & Tool Company Limited should \u201cforthwith construct a Mark V Tower\u201d and were doing so on behalf of Marine Drilling Towers Limited. The same three, in accordance with clause 1 of the said agreement of April 29, 1957, had caused Marine Drilling Towers Limited to be incorporated and that corporation was therefore a legal entity with the powers granted by the charter at the time. To order the completion of the tower on behalf of Marine Drilling was merely the carrying out of the next and most important duty of the three parties to the agreement. It is true that no formal order in the name of Marine Drilling Towers Limited was ever given in writing nor was any by-law or even resolution ever enacted, but the three persons who had the sole control of that company acted in concert to see that this next and most important step of the company was taken in accordance with the agreement. It must be remembered that the regrettable failure to employ the usual corporate procedures would not have concerned Accurate Machine & Tool Company Limited. That company was controlled completely by Messrs. Bodi and Bowland who were parties to the agreement of April 29, 1957, and who would recognize that the \u201cgo-ahead order\u201d, no matter how informal, was the carrying out of clause 5(6) of that agreement and that in fact Marine Drilling, out of the mouths of those who had incorporated it and who alone controlled it, was ordering the completion of the tower.\nThen when the payment of the $30,000 to Accurate Machine & Tool Company Limited is considered, we see an exact confirmation of this view of what occurred. A consideration of the evidence given by Mr. Paxton, the vice-president of Aqua-Land and Mr. Kirby its secretary, surely demonstrates that the cheque for that amount made out by Aqua-Land in favour of Accurate Machine & Tool Company Limited and delivered to the latter was simply a method of paying to the latter company of part of the price which, by the agreement of April 29, 1957, Marine Drilling was to pay for the construction of the tower. Aqua-Land, under the terms of that agreement, was to subscribe $39,200 for preference stock in Marine Drilling. By this cheque for $30,000, Aqua-Land was paying, or pre-paying, that much of its subscription. The balance of $9,200 was still owing on its subscription for shares in Marine Drilling and after such payment and the completion and delivery of the tower, Marine Drilling still owed $9,200 to Accurate Machine & Tool Company Limited. Again the proper method would have been to have Aqua-Land draw its cheque for $30,000 in favour of Marine Drilling and then Marine Drilling deliver its cheque for that amount to Accurate Machine & Tool Company Limited. However, Marine Drilling had only provisional directors and no bank account so the informal means were employed but the essential character of the payment was not altered.\nThis view of the circumstances would result in the respondent\u2019s only interest in the tower being that of a shareholder in Marine Drilling, or an investor entitled to have issued to it shares for which it has paid in part such payment having been used in part payment for the completion of the tower. It would appear upon the authorities analyzed by Mr. Justice Ritchie that such a result would not give to the respondent the direct relationship to the property in the tower to constitute an insurable interest.\nTherefore, I would allow this appeal, set aside the judgment at trial and upon appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario and dismiss the action. The appellants will have their costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs, CARTWRIGHT and JUDSON JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the defendants, appellants: Smiley and Allingham, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the plaintiff, respondent: J.J.

Pea Growers Limited (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1965: October 18, 19; 1965: December 14.\nPresent: Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR MANITOBA\nMunicipal corporations\u2014Nuisance\u2014Seepage from city's sewage lagoon to plaintiff's farm land\u2014Liability for damages\u2014Charter of the City of Portage la Prairie, 1907 (Man.), c. 33, ss. 98, 99, 100\u2014The Expropria- tion Act, 1962 (Man.), c. 18, s. 28A\u2014The Municipal Act, R.S.M. 1954, c. 173, s. 944.\nThe plaintiff was the owner of land, on which it operated a seed cleaning mill and a farm, which adjoined land owned by the defendant on which the defendant located and operated a sewage lagoon, erected in 1958, for the purpose of disposing of sewage from the City of Portage la Prairie. It was put into operation in the year 1959. The plaintiff claimed that during the fall of that year, in 1960, and in 1961 to the date of the statement of claim, \"water\" had seeped from it on to the plaintiff's land, causing damage to crop and the flooding of the pit in its mill, so that it could not be operated without extensive repairs. The judgment at trial in favour of the plaintiff granted an injunction restraining the defendant municipality from causing or permitting sewage, water, or effluent, or any part of these to escape from its sewage lagoon and to flow or pass into or upon the plaintiff's land, and also awarded damages and costs. The Court of Appeal unanimously affirmed the trial judgment and the municipality then appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe appellant, having created a nuisance which caused damage to the respondent, was liable therefor, because that which was complained of as a nuisance was not expressly or impliedly authorized by the statute (Charter of the City of Portage la Prairie, 1907 (Man.), c. 33) in accordance with which the lagoon was constructed, and was not the inevitable consequence of that which the statute authorized and contemplated. Other statutory provisions relating to construction of sewage facilities, i.e. 1957 (Man.), cc. 86 and 87, added nothing to the powers which were given to the appellant under its charter. The same applied to the regulations made pursuant to The Public Health Act, R.S.M. 1954, c. 211.\nSection 28A of The Expropriation Act, 1962 (Man.), c. 18, respecting compensation for land taken or injuriously affected, was not a bar to the respondent's action. That section did not provide any remedy to the respondent, because, in the light of the findings of fact made by the trial judge, it could not be said that damage to the respondent necessarily resulted from the exercise by the appellant of its power to construct a sewage system. Nor was there any intention on the part of the Legislature to deprive the respondent of those remedies available to it at common law in respect of the damage which it sustained. District of North Vancouver v. McKenzie Barge & Marine Ways Ltd., [1965] S.C.R. 377, distinguished.\nThe liability of the appellant for damages did not arise from negligence on the part of its engineers. Accordingly, s. 944 of The Municipal Act, R.S.M. 1954, c. 173, which provides a defence in respect of an engineer's negligence, was not applicable.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1] , affirming a judgment of Nitikman J. Appeal dismissed.\nG. T. Gregory, for the defendant, appellant.\nJ. K. Knox, for the plaintiff, respondent. The judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014This appeal is from the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[2], which affirmed the judgment at trial in favour of the plaintiff, which granted an injunction restraining the defendant from causing or permitting sewage, water, or effluent, or any part of these to escape from its sewage lagoon and to flow or pass into or upon the plaintiff's land, and also awarded damages and costs.\nThe respondent is the owner of land, on which it operates a seed cleaning mill and a farm, which lies immediately to the north of land owned by the appellant on which the appellant located and operated 'a sewage lagoon, erected in 1958, for the purpose of disposing of sewage from the City of Portage la Prairie. It was put into operation in the year 1959. The respondent claimed that during the fall of that year, in 1960, and in 1961 to the date of the statement of claim, \"water\" had seeped from it on to the respondent's land, causing damage to crop and the flooding of the pit in its mill, so that it could not be operated without extensive repairs. A claim was also made in respect of noxious odors emanating from the lagoon, but this aspect of the claim is no longer in issue.\nAfter a careful review of the evidence, the learned trial judge reached the following conclusions:\nI am convinced that there is seepage from the lagoon with the result that the escaping water flows into and onto the plaintiff's land and into the pit of the mill and basement of the farm buildings. In consequence thereof, the plaintiff's land has become overburdened and cannot be used for farming operations or, for that matter, any operation formerly carried on there by the plaintiff. Nor can the mill be used for the purpose for which it was intended, or was put to, prior to operation of the defendant's lagoon.\n***\nI find as a fact that the water-logging and overburdening is caused by, and is the result of, seepage from the defendant's sewage lagoon and that, insofar as the plaintiff is concerned, this constitutes a nuisance. It is an interference with the plaintiff's rights. I further find as a fact that by reason of the overburdening by water on the plaintiff's land, the plaintiff was unable to farm it for the period from 1961 onward and that, in addition, due to water in the mill pit, operation of the mill could not be carried on for part of 1960, and from 1962 onward. Dealing with the question as to whether the escape or seepage of the effluent was necessarily incidental to the operation by the appellant of the sewage lagoon, he found as follows:\nI cannot under any circumstances conceive seepage to be incidental to the operation of a lagoon. As stated earlier, the purpose of a lagoon is to contain the effluent, not permit it to escape.\nNor has the defendant satisfied me that seepage is the inevitable result of lagoon construction or operation and cannot be prevented by the employment of proper means. The defendant has not only failed to establish that it has used reasonable diligence or taken all reasonable steps and precautions to prevent leakage from the lagoon with its resulting nuisance, but to my mind quite the contrary is the case.\nThe conclusions of the learned trial judge were upheld by the Court of Appeal.\nOn the appeal to this Court the argument of counsel for the appellant was in respect of two submissions of law:\n1. That the appellant was under a statutory mandate to erect and maintain the work in question, and that it was required to do what it did, in the fashion which it did, by such mandate.\n2. That s. 944 of The Municipal Act, R.S.M. 1954, c. 173, provided a complete defence to the action.\nIn determining the first question, it is necessary to consider the statutory provisions upon which the appellant relies. These are ss. 98, 99 and 100 of the Charter of the City of Portage la Prairie, 1907 (Man.), c. 33, which provide as follows:\n98. The city may and shall have power to install, design, contract, build, purchase, improve, hold and generally maintain, manage, operate and conduct a system of waterworks and sewerage, and all main pipes, buildings, matters, machinery and appliances therewith connected or necessary thereto, in the City of Portage la Prairie, and parts adjacent as hereinafter provided.\n99. The city shall have all the powers necessary to enable it to build the waterworks and sewers hereinafter mentioned, and to improve, secure, maintain and enlarge any of said works from time to time as to the said city may seem meet, and to carry out all and every the other powers conferred upon it by this Act.\n100. It shall be the duty of the council of said city to examine, consider and decide upon all matters relative to supplying the said City of Portage la Prairie, by the means contemplated by this Act, with a sufficient quantity of pure and wholesome water for the use of its inhabitants, and also to provide, build or construct the necessary waterworks, sewers, buildings, machinery and other appliances requisite for the said object.\nSection 98 gives to the city the power to install, maintain and operate a system of waterworks and sewerage in the city and parts adjacent. The lagoon in question was in a part adjacent.\nSection 99 confers on the city all powers necessary to enable it to build the waterworks and sewers mentioned in the subsequent sections of the Act and to improve, maintain and enlarge them from time to time.\nSection 100 relates not to the city, but to the city council, upon which is imposed the duty to decide upon matters relating to supplying the city with a sufficient quantity of pure and wholesome water, i.e., to formulate the plans necessary for that purpose, and also to carry them out by providing, building or constructing the necessary waterworks, sewers, etc., requisite for that object.\nThe combined effect of these sections, in relation to the circumstances of this case, is that the appellant was granted the power to build and maintain a sewerage system, with a duty imposed upon its council to devise the necessary plans for the object of providing a water supply and to carry them out, including the provision of sewers. There was no direction to adopt any particular method of sewage disposal. The appellant was given the power to construct a sewage lagoon but it was not subject to a specific mandate to do so irrespective of whether a nuisance was thereby created or not. There is nothing in the City Charter expressly providing that it was to be exempted from its common law liability for maintaining a nuisance if, in fact, a nuisance did result. Nor is this a case in which the appellant can contend successfully that the creation of a nuisance was an inevitable consequence of the exercise of its statutory powers and that, in consequence, the statute would provide a defence to a claim in respect of it. The learned trial judge has made a specific finding to the contrary.\nIn addition to the provisions, previously quoted, contained in the Charter of the City of Portage la Prairie, some reliance was placed on other statutory provisions. Counsel referred to the two special Acts, Chapters 86 and 87 of the Statutes of Manitoba 1957. These statutes ratified, confirmed and made binding on the appellant by-laws authorizing it to enter into an agreement with Campbell Soup Company Limited, and to borrow money, without a vote of the ratepayers for the construction of sewage facilities necessitated by that agreement. In my opinion they do not assist the appellant's submission on this point. They do not add anything to the powers which were given to the appellant under its charter.\nThe same applies to the regulations made pursuant to The Public Health Act, R.S.M. 1954, c. 211. In brief, these regulations require a municipality contemplating the construction of a sewage disposal or treatment system to submit plans, specifications and other material to the Minister, and prohibit such construction without his certificate that such construction may be carried out. These provisions do not add to the appellant's statutory powers, but make their exercise conditional upon this required procedure being followed. Nor are the appellant's powers enlarged by the provision which enables the Minister to authorize the construction by one municipality of sewage disposal works in another municipality.\nSome reliance was placed upon the decision of this Court in District of North Vancouver v. McKenzie Barge & Marine Ways Ltd.[3] Reference was made to the statutory provision contained in s. 28A of The Expropriation Act, enacted by c. 18, Statutes of Manitoba 1962, which replaced s. 398 of The Municipal Act, R.S.M. 1954, c. 173. It reads as follows:\n28A. A municipal corporation shall make to the owners of, or other persons interested in, land entered upon, taken, or used by it in the exercise of any of its powers, or injuriously affected thereby, due compensation for the land so entered upon, taken, or used, and for any damages necessarily resulting from the exercise of those powers, beyond any advantage which the claimant may derive from the contemplated work; and any claim for such compensation, if not mutually agreed upon, or if no other provision is made for determining the compensation, shall be determined by arbitration as herein provided.\nThe wording of this section is similar to, but not identical with, that of the first portion of s. 478(1) of the Municipal Act, R.S. B.C. 1960, c. 255, which was referred to in that case.\nSection 398 of The Municipal Act of Manitoba was repealed on August 4, 1959, and an entirely different section was substituted for it. It reappeared, as a part of The Expropriation Act, by an amendment to that Act enacted on March 30, 1962, and was then given retroactive effect to August 4, 1959. The provision did not exist at the time the respondent suffered the damage complained of in the statement of claim, nor at the time the statement of claim was issued.\nThe essential difference between the British Columbia case and the present one was the existence in the British Columbia statute of s. 529, which provided that:\nNo action arising out of, or by reason of, or in respect of, the construction, maintenance, operation, or user of any drain or ditch authorized by section 527, whether such drain or ditch now is or is hereafter constructed, shall be brought or maintained in any Court against any district municipality.\nThe decision in the District of North Vancouver case was that, in the light of that provision, a person who sustained damage as a result of the construction, maintenance, operation or user of a drain or ditch authorized by s. 527 could only make such claim for compensation as might be available to him under the provisions of s. 478(1). There is no statutory provision similar to s. 529 in any Manitoba statute to which we were referred.\nI do not regard s. 28A of The Expropriation Act of Manitoba as constituting a bar to the bringing of an action for damages by the respondent in the circumstances of the present case. That section did not provide any remedy to the respondent because, in the light of the findings of fact made by the learned trial judge, it could not be said that damage to the respondent necessarily resulted from the exercise by the appellant of its power to construct a sewage disposal system. Nor do I find in this section, or in the other statutory provisions cited to us, any intention on the part of the Legislature to deprive the respondent of those remedies available to it at common law in respect of the damage which it sustained.\nMy conclusion, in respect of the first point raised by the appellant, is that the appellant, having created a nuisance which caused damage to the respondent, is liable therefor, because that which is complained of as a nuisance was not expressly or impliedly authorized by the statute in accordance with which the lagoon was constructed, and was not the inevitable consequence of that which the statute authorized and contemplated.\nThe next point raised is that a complete defence to the action is to be found in the provisions of s. 944 of The Municipal Act, which provides: 944. Where a municipal corporation constructs any public work under the supervision of a civil engineer, a Manitoba land surveyor, or some other person competent to perform the work, if the work is carried out in accordance with the plans and specifications and in good faith, the corporation is not liable for damages arising from any negligence on the part of the engineer, surveyor, or other person entrusted with the supervision of the work.\nThe learned trial judge made a specific finding that there was no evidence of such negligence in this case and, in consequence, held that the section had no application. The reasons delivered in the Court of Appeal confirm this view and point out that the appellant's liability in this case is founded, not on negligence, but on nuisance.\nThe appellant's submission before us was that a nuisance could not have arisen unless the appellant's engineers had been negligent, and that, since s. 944 provides a defence in respect of an engineer's negligence, the action fails for that reason.\nI do not agree with this reasoning. It was not necessary, in order to fix the appellant with liability for the creation of a nuisance, for the respondent to establish negligence on the part of the appellant or of its engineers in the construction of the lagoon. The learned trial judge has found that there was no negligence on the part of the engineers. The position is that a nuisance was created, even though the engineers were not negligent, which was not expressly or impliedly authorized by the statutory powers which permitted its construction, and that is sufficient to make the appellant liable. In these circumstances s. 944 can have no application. The liability of the appellant for damages, in this case, does not arise from negligence on the part of the engineers.\nFor the foregoing reasons, in my opinion, this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Swift, Macleod, Deacon, Kirby & Gregory, Winnipeg.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: Tupper, Adams & Co., Winnipeg.\n[1] (1965), 50 W.W.R. 415, 49 D.L.R.

The taxi company gave a promissory note to the plaintiff for the amount of the purchase price and the defendant gave his personal guarantee of payment. The plaintiff discounted the note with the Bank of Nova Scotia and the latter informed the parties that the limit of its lending on this account would be $20,000.\nAfter having made four payments of $1,000 each to the bank, the taxi company purchased five new cars from the plaintiff for a total sum of $13,672.50. It traded in five of its fleet of used cars and received a credit of $7,982.50, leaving a balance owing on the deal of $5,690. As part of the same deal the taxi company paid direct to the plaintiff the sum of $1,000, so that the amount of indebtedness would not exceed the $20,000 limit set by the bank. A new note was signed for $19,855.60, which, in turn, was discounted with the bank. The defendant, however, refused to extend his liability on the guarantee to cover the new indebtedness. The taxi company made further payments to the bank amounting to $4,000.\nSubsequently, the taxi business failed and some months thereafter the bank charged back to the plaintiff the amount of the note which was then outstanding. The plaintiff, at the defendant's request, had taken possession of the cars and those that could be repaired were sold. The plaintiff later sued the defendant on his guarantee. The amount allowed by the trial judge was varied on appeal, and an appeal by the plaintiff was then brought to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nThe plaintiff was entitled to judgment for the balance remaining of the original indebtedness of $19,382.40 less the principal payments of $8,000 and less the sum of $200 which was realized on the four original cars. It was also entitled to interest at the contractual rate on the diminishing sum after giving credit for these payments.\nThe $1,000 paid on the new deal was not a payment on the guaranteed indebtedness. Nor could the total proceeds from the sale of the cars be applied on that indebtedness. The defendant was only entitled to be subrogated to the security on the four original cars. As guarantor he had no interest in the five new cars purchased in the second transaction. Also, the defendant's contention that non-compliance with The Conditional Sales Act, 1955 (Nfld.), c. 62, excused the taxi company entirely from the whole indebtedness failed. The plaintiff did not repossess under the terms of its conditional sales contracts; on the contrary, there was a voluntary surrender of the cars and the plaintiff was instructed to make the best of the situation.\nThe defendant also failed in his submission that when the new note was signed, the indebtedness represented by the old note or the balance owing on the old note disappeared. The reduced sum owing at the time of the new purchase was incorporated in the new note, but the defendant's liability as guarantor was limited to the reduced sum only.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Newfoundland (On Appeal)[1] , varying a judgment of Dunfield J. in an action on a guarantee. Appeal allowed.\nB. A. Crane, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nG. J. Gorman, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014Adelaide Motors Limited sued James Byrne on a guarantee which he had given to that company for the indebtedness of A.B.C. Taxi Cabs Limited. The company obtained a judgment at trial which, on the reference directed, would have resulted in an assessment of $15,519.89. On appeal1 judgment was given for $2,399.90. The Appellate Court took a different view from the trial judge concerning the application of certain payments made on account of the taxi cab company's indebtedness. This makes necessary a review of the dealings among the three parties.\nEarly in 1958, Byrne, along with one other person, incorporated A.B.C. Taxi Cabs Limited. He intended to go into the taxi business and he negotiated the purchase of nine used cars from Adelaide Motors for a purchase price of $19,382.40. These were sold under conditional sales contracts and, in addition, Byrne gave his personal guarantee of payment in the following terms:\nSt. John's Nfld.\nJune 30th, 1958.\nAdelaide Motors Ltd.,\nSt. John's Nfld.\nDear Sirs,\nThis is to advise you that in view of the accommodation which you arranged through the Bank of Nova Scotia for $19,382.40 on behalf of the A.B.C. Cabs Ltd., I give you my personal guarantee that I will see that this indebtedness is paid off according to the arrangements made and that your interests are protected at all times.\n(sgd) James E. Byrne \"The arrangements made\" referred to in the guarantee were that monthly instalments of $1,000 each would be paid in accordance with the terms of the conditional sales contract.\nWhen the cars were purchased the taxi cab company had given a promissory note to Adelaide Motors for the purchase price of $19,382.40. Adelaide Motors had discounted this note with the Bank of Nova Scotia and the bank had informed the parties that the limit of its lending on this account would be $20,000. In August, September, October and November of 1958 the taxi company paid to the bank four payments of $1,000 each. There is no question that these payments must be applied on the $19,382.40, the guaranteed indebtedness, in reduction of Byrne's liability under the guarantee.\nIn December 1958, the taxi cab company purchased five new cars from Adelaide Motors for a total sum of $13, 672.50. It traded in five of its fleet of used cars and received a credit of $7,982.50, leaving a balance owing on the deal of $5,690. With $15,000 plus interest still outstanding on the original purchase, if this sum of $5,690 had been added to the outstanding indebtedness any consolidated new note taken would have been over the $20,000 limit set by the bank. Therefore, as part of the same deal, the taxi cab company paid direct to Adelaide Motors the sum of $1,000. Byrne now says that this $1,000 should be credited on the guaranteed indebtedness. When these new cars were purchased Byrne had refused to extend his liability on the guarantee to cover this new indebtedness. The $1,000 cash paid on the new deal is in the same position as the credit of $7,982.50. It was not a payment on the guaranteed indebtedness any more than the $7,982.50 credit for the old cars which were traded in. Both the credit and the $1,000 cash payment were part and parcel of the purchase of the new cars. Up to this point, therefore, Byrne is entitled only to a credit of $4,000 on the original guaranteed indebtedness of $19,382.40.\nIn 1959, the taxi cab company paid to the bank in February, March and April three payments of $1,000 each, and in August and September two payments of $500 each. These payments were made in accordance with the terms of the guarantee and the surety is entitled to have these credited on the original amount. Therefore, the total principal payments on the original note of $19,382.40 amount to $8,000, and Byrne, as guarantor, is entitled to these credits. From the date of each payment interest runs on a diminishing sum which will have to be calculated.\nThe taxi cab company did not prosper and its cars deteriorated rapidly. After September 1959 no further payments were made on account of its liabilities to Adelaide Motors and it went out of business in October or November. In May of 1960 the bank charged back to Adelaide Motors the amount of the note which was then outstanding. This note, of course, included not only the original indebtedness but the $4,690 by which the original indebtedness had been increased as a result of the purchase of the new cars in December of 1958 and for which Byrne was not liable on his guarantee.\nAfter the failure of the taxi cab company, at Byrne's request Adelaide Motors took possession of the cabs. Again at the suggestion of Byrne, those cars that could be repaired were sold and the proceeds amounted to $1,713.32. Byrne is claiming this sum to be applied on the guaranteed indebtedness. He is in error in this submission. He was only entitled to be subrogated to the security on the four original cars that were left. As guarantor he had no interest in the five new cars purchased in December 1958. He had not increased his guarantee to cover this purchase. He also says that non-compliance with The Conditional Sales Act, 1955 (Nfld.), c. 62, excuses the taxi cab company entirely from the whole indebtedness but the evidence shows that Adelaide Motors did not repossess under the terms of its conditional sales contracts; that, on the contrary, there was a voluntary surrender of these cars and that Adelaide was instructed to make the best of the situation. They did repair the cars and sold them privately. It was agreed by counsel that the four original cars in which Byrne was interested as guarantor realized approximately $50 each. Byrne is entitled to a further credit on the guaranteed indebtedness of $200.\nByrne also urged that when the new cars were purchased and a new note was signed for $19,855.60, the indebtedness represented by the old note or the balance owing on the old note disappeared. Again, this is incorrect. What Byrne guaranteed was a specific indebtedness of $19,382.40. This indebtedness was not paid off. The reduced sum owing at the time of the new purchase in December 1958 was incorporated in a new note which, in turn, was discounted with the bank. But the liability of Byrne as guarantor was limited to only the reduced sum owing. The offsetting entry in the books kept by Adelaide Motors was in no sense a payment in full of the old indebtedness which discharged Byrne's liability under his guarantee.\nI would allow the appeal with costs of the trial and the appeal to this Court. There should be no order for costs on the first appeal. Adelaide Motors is entitled to judgment for the balance remaining of the original indebtedness of $19,382.40 less the payments of $8,000 above referred to and less the sum of $200 realized on the sale of the four cars. It is also entitled to interest at the contractual rate on the diminishing sum after giving credit for these payments.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the plaintiff, appellant: P. D. Lewis, St. John's.\nSolicitor for the defendant, respondent: N. S. Noel, St. John's.\n[1] (1964), 49 M.P.R. 197.\n",

The victim, who was coming out of school at the same time as other pupils, attempted to cross a street from west to east after the southbound traffic had been given the signal to advance by a constable on duty at the intersetion. A southbound bus was parked close to the west sidewalk, at a short distance from the intersection. The defendant had stopped his car with its front about even with the rear of the bus. The victim had to pass in front of the bus. When the front of the automobile was about in line with the front of the bus, the defendant saw the victim for the first time and, although he applied his brakes immediately, he could not avoid hitting him. It was further alleged against the defendant that he aggravated the victim's damages by permitting him, while driving him home after the accident, to walk, at the boy's own suggestion, the last part of the way to his home. The trial judge dismissed the action. This judgment was affirmed by a majority decision in the Court of Appeal. The plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Hall J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Fauteux, Abbott, Ritchie and Spence JJ.: The question in such cases was whether the driver fell short of the standard of care that would be expected of a reasonable man under the circumstances. A driver might escape liability if he could establish that he had conformed with that standard. The defendant has successfully rebutted any presumption that he was at fault. The defendant's conduct subsequent to the accident did not constitute a fault even though it may have resulted in aggravating the injuries.\nPer Hall J. dissenting: The defendant has not successfully rebutted the presumption under s. 53 of the Motor Vehicle Act that he was at fault. Any time a driver in a school zone, in broad daylight, at a time when young pupils are leaving adjacent school premises and some had to cross in front of him and who admits, as the defendant did, that he did not see any of the children who crossed in front of his car as he sat there stationary from 50 to 60 seconds and who says further that he did not see the boy which his vehicle struck until the moment of the impact, that driver has not rebutted the presumption of fault which the statute imposes on him. The traffic officer's signal did not relieve the defendant from his duty to keep a sharp lookout for school children who might emerge in front of the bus.\nAutomobiles\u2014Intersection\u2014Agent de circulation\u2014Signal pour changer la direction du trafic\u2014Jeune pi\u00e9ton frapp\u00e9 par une automobile alors qu'il traversait la rue\u2014Norme des soins requis\u2014La pr\u00e9somption a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9fut\u00e9e\u2014Aggravation des dommages\u2014Code de la Route, S.R.Q. 1941, c. 142, art. 53.\nLe fils mineur du demandeur fut bless\u00e9 lorsqu'il fut frapp\u00e9 par une automobile conduite par le d\u00e9fendeur.

Appeal dismissed, Hall J. dissenting.\nT. P. Slattery, Q.C., and F. E. Barnard, Q.C., for the plaintiff, appellant.\nR\u00e9mi Taschereau, Q.C., for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of Fauteux, Abbott, Ritchie and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nABBOTT J.:\u2014This appeal is from a majority judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench[3] , confirming a judgment of the Superior Court which dismissed an action by appellant acting in his quality of tutor to his minor son Patrick O'Brien, claiming damages in the sum of $75,000 alleged to have been suffered as a result of the said Patrick O'Brien having been struck by an automobile owned and driven by the respondent.\nOwen J. dissenting, held that both respondent and Patrick O'Brien were at fault and responsible for the accident, in the proportions of one-third and two-thirds respectively. He assessed the damages at $26,941.80. He would therefore have allowed the appeal with costs and condemned respondent to pay to appellant \u00e8s qualit\u00e9 the sum of $8,980.60 with interest and costs.\nThe facts are not now seriously in dispute. They are recited by Owen J. in his dissenting judgment, as follows:\nOn the 13th March 1958, at approximately 11.30 A.M., Patrick O'Brien, 10 1\/2 years of age, came out of St. Patrick High School at Thetford Mines with the other pupils. From the school he went to the North-West corner of the intersection of Dumais St., (which runs East to West) and Notre Dame St. (which runs North and South). He wanted to cross Notre Dame St. from West to East. A Southbound autobus was parked on the West side of Notre Dame St. a short distance to the North of Dumais St. The defendant Mailhot was driving his automobile from North to South on Notre Dame St., When a constable at the intersection stopped the traffic on Notre Dame St., Mailhot brought his automobile to a stop with its front about even with the rear of the autobus and to the East of the autobus. There were no other motor vehicles in the traffic lane in front of Mailhot's automobile.\nAfter several school children had crossed Notre Dame Street from West to East the constable apparently gave the signal to permit traffic on Notre Dame Street to move. Mr. Mailhot started his automobile, advanced in a Southerly direction alongside the autobus which remained stationary on his right. When the front of the automobile was about abreast of the front of the autobus Mailhot, for the first time, saw young O'Brien in front of and very close to his automobile. The automobile was being driven at a moderate speed, less than 10 miles per hour, and although Mailhot applied the brakes as soon as he was aware of the danger he was unable to avoid hitting the boy and knocking him down with the front of the automobile. Young O'Brien had crossed in front of the stationary autobus and did not see the automobile coming from his left until it was on top of him.\nThe evidence is contradictory as to whether the boy was walking quickly or running just prior to the accident. The evidence is also contradictory as to the distance between the boy and the front of the stationary bus when he crossed in front of the bus. The bus driver Walker said that his bus was about seven or eight feet from the corner and that young O'Brien passed right in front of his bus no more than a foot away. However according to the witness Donovan the accident happened at a point about 15 to 20 feet to the South of the front of the stationary autobus. As Montgomery J. points out, the bus driver Walker was perhaps best situated to see what happened. He described the accident as follows:\nJ'ai arr\u00eat\u00e9, et puis j'ai vu un petit bonhomme sauter devant l'autobus, il y avait un constable qui faisait la circulation, il n'y en avait plus, il a fait signe \u00e0 monsieur Mailhot, il a pass\u00e9, j'ai vu arriver le petit bonhomme \u00e0 la course, il a saut\u00e9 devant le char \u00e0 Monsieur Mailhot.\nAs to the distance between the boy and the autobus when he passed in front of it, Walker's evidence on cross-examination was as follows:\nQ. A quelle distance, \u00e0 combien de pieds le jeune O'Brien passait-il devant votre autobus quand vous l'avez vu?\nR. Il n'y avait certainement pas plus qu'un pied, il passait juste en avant.\nQ. Et, apr\u00e8s l'accident, de combien de pieds \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s, le devant de l'automobile de monsieur Mailhot d\u00e9passait-il le devant de votre autobus?\nR. Monsieur Mailhot ne devait pas avoir plus d'un pied et demi en avant de mon autobus, je n'ai pas mesur\u00e9, mais. . .\nHis testimony was confirmed on this point by that of other witnesses.\nThe legal principle to be applied in order to determine whether Mailhot had successfully rebutted any presumption that he was at fault, was correctly stated by Montgomery J. in the following passage of his judgment:\nIn any case where the driver of an automobile strikes a pedestrian, it is difficult to find with certainty that the driver could not have avoided the accident by taking some extra precautions. In my opinion, this is not the test. The question in each case is whether the driver fell in any way short of the standard of care that would be expected of a reasonable man under the circumstances. While our courts are ready to condemn the driver for even a slight deviation from this standard, he may escape liability if he can establish that he has conformed with it.\nAmong other grounds, counsel for appellant submitted that Mailhot was at fault in stopping his car at the rear rather than at the front of the autobus. This ground does not appear to have been pressed in the Courts below and is not dealt with in the judgments. In any event I am unable to agree with this submission. It is obvious that Mailhot could have stopped abreast of or about abreast of the front of the autobus, but in my view there was no particular reason why he should have done so. On the facts above set out, it is clear that the accident must have happened a fraction of a second after the front of the Mailhot car passed the front of the stationary autobus. Moreover in order for Mailhot to have seen the approach of young O'Brien, before putting his car in motion, it is clear that the front of his car would have had to project at least five or six feet in front of the bus.\nApplying the test to which I have referred, in my opinion, the majority in the Court below were correct in holding that respondent had successfully rebutted any presumption that he was at fault. Similarly, I agree that respondent's conduct subsequent to this unfortunate accident did not constitute a fault even though it may have resulted in aggravating the injury.\nHaving considered the evidence, the arguments of counsel and the authorities to which they referred, I find myself in agreement with the conclusion and reasons of Montgomery J. I do not think that anything would be gained by attempting to summarize or re-state those reasons and I am content to adopt them.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nHALL J. (dissenting):\u2014To the facts stated by Owen J. in his dissenting judgment as set out in the judgment of my brother Abbott, certain further facts ought, I think, to be noted, namely: (1) The intersection in question was, to the knowledge of Mailhot, in a school zone and he was aware that at the time in question in this action the pupils were leaving the school premises and heading homewards for lunch and that some would have to cross Notre Dame Street from west to east on their way home; (2) The O'Brien boy was in the pedestrian cross-walk area when struck. He was partially crippled and walked with a limp; (3) A man named Louis Donovan was sitting at the wheel of his car on the east side of Notre Dame north of Dumais Street waiting for his daughter to take her home for lunch. Ellen Donovan crossed from west to east. The O'Brien boy was right behind her as she started to cross. Seeing her father, she ran towards her father's car. She had not reached her father before young O'Brien was struck.\nMailhot testified that he was not aware of having seen Ellen Donovan or any other children cross Notre Dame Street as he sat waiting for the signal to go ahead although it was beyond question that Ellen was immediately ahead of the O'Brien boy as they started across, and that several other children had in fact crossed from in front of the bus before Ellen. That a number of children had crossed Notre Dame Street after Mailhot arrived on the scene is fully established by the evidence of Leopold Poulin, the officer directing traffic at the intersection in question. He said:\nQ. Voulez-vous nous raconter, monsieur, ce qui s'est pass\u00e9?\nR. En faisant la circulation, j'avais donn\u00e9 le signal d'arr\u00eat \u00e0 l'automobiliste monsieur Mailhot pour laisser passer les jeunes enfants, des enfants de huit \u00e0 dix ans.\n***\nQ. Avant l'accident, je comprends que vous aviez laiss\u00e9 traverser les enfants du coin ouest de la rue Dumais vers le coin est de la rue Dumais, traverser Notre-Dame?\nR. Oui monsieur.\nQ. Un groupe d'enfants ensemble?\nR. Oui monsieur.\nQ. Est-ce qu'ils \u00e9taient nombreux?\nR. Ils \u00e9taient six ou huit.\nQ. Est-ce que c'\u00e9tait le seul groupe d'enfants que vous faisiez traverser dans ce sens-l\u00e0 depuis la sortie des classes?\nR. Non, ils \u00e9taient presque tous sortis.\nQ. Il en \u00e9tait pass\u00e9 plusieurs?\nR. Oui.\nQ. Monsieur Mailhot \u00e9tait arr\u00eat\u00e9 depuis combien de temps?\nR. Environ cinquante \u00e0 soixante secondes autour d'une minute.\nMailhot's evidence was that he did not see the boy at all until the impact. He testified as follows:\nPAR LA COUR:\nQ. O\u00f9 \u00e9tait-il par rapport \u00e0 votre automobile, par rapport \u00e0 l'autobus ou par rapport au trottoir, la premi\u00e8re fois que vous l'avez vu le jeune O'Brien?\nR. La premi\u00e8re fois que je l'ai vu, il est arriv\u00e9 en avant de mon char en appuyant ses deux mains sur mon fanal.\nQ. Vous ne l'avez pas vu ailleurs?\nR. Je ne l'ai pas vu ailleurs.\n***\nQ. Vous avez, dans ce cas-l\u00e0, aper\u00e7u l'enfant la premi\u00e8re fois alors qu'il \u00e9tait devant votre v\u00e9hicule?\nR. Alors qu'il mettait ses mains sur le fanal droit de mon v\u00e9hicule.\n***\nQ. Combien de temps \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s avez-vous \u00e9t\u00e9 stationnaire?\nR. Peut-\u00eatre 50, 50 \u00e0 60 secondes.\nQ. Pendant que vous \u00e9tiez stationnaire, comme \u00e7a, avez-vous vu des enfants traverser la rue?\nR. Je peux en avoir vu, mais je n'ai pas remarqu\u00e9, j'ai remarqu\u00e9 seulement le constable, en attendant mon signal.\n*** Q. Vous avez long\u00e9 le flanc gauche de l'autobus?\nR. Oui monsieur.\nQ. A quelle distance, \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s?\nR. A peu pr\u00e8s un pied et demi de l'autobus.\n***\nQ. Avez-vous d'autre chose \u00e0 ajouter?\nR. Parce que je n'avais pas de visibilit\u00e9 pour voir venir l'enfant, je ne pouvais pas voir de l'autre c\u00f4t\u00e9 de l'autobus, en avant de l'autobus, de la mani\u00e8re que mon char \u00e9tait plac\u00e9\u2026.\nThe boy did not, of course, come from the other side of the bus or around the front of it. He had come on the sidewalk from ahead and to the right of the bus which was stationary at all relevant times.\nSection 53 of The Motor Vehicle Act of the Province of Quebec in force at the time reads:\nWhenever loss or damage is sustained by any person by reason of a motor vehicle on a public highway, the burden of proof that such loss or damage did not arise through the negligence or improper conduct of the owner or driver of such motor vehicle shall be upon such owner or driver.\nThe learned trial judge held that in the circumstances of this case this burden of proof section did not apply. In this he was completely in error. The Court of Appeal applied the section, but by a majority judgment held that the respondent had successfully rebutted the presumption.\nOwen J. dissented, saying:\nOn the evidence I am of the opinion that young O'Brien was at fault. He attempted to cross Notre Dame Street against the signal of the constable. If he had stopped before emerging from the protection afforded by the stationary autobus and looked to his left he could have seen Mailhot's automobile and remained in a position of safety. This he failed to do. These faults were determining causes of the accident.\nThe problem which has given me such difficulty is deciding whether Mailhot also committed any fault or faults which contributed to the accident. Mailhot had lived in Thetford Mines for a number of years. He was familiar with the intersection and knew that it was a school zone. In the circumstances a high standard of care was required of him when passing alongside the stationary autobus which obstructed his vision of any pedestrian who might come from his right where the school was located. After studying his testimony I am of the opinion that Mailhot placed too much dependence on the signal from the constable in charge of traffic and failed to take proper precautions by keeping his automobile under absolute control and keeping a very strict lookout for anything that might be coming from his right. In this case it was foreseeable, as far as Mailhot was concerned, that some child coming out of the school at noon-hour would cross in front of the stationary autobus even after the constable had given his signal to change the direction of the flow of traffic. I have come to the conclusion that Mailhot was at fault and that his fault contributed to the accident. In my opinion the fault of the child was greater than that of the motorist and I would hold Mailhot liable to pay one-third of the damages suffered by young O'Brien.\nI agree with Owen J., and it follows that Mailhot has not successfully rebutted the presumption that he was at fault. For myself, and with deference to contrary opinion, I am of the view that any time a driver in the situation that Mailhot was in here, i.e., in a school zone, in broad daylight, at a time when young pupils were leaving adjacent school premises and some had to cross in front of him and who admits, as Mailhot did, that he did not see any of the children who crossed in front of his car as he sat there stationary for from 50 to 60 seconds and who says further that he did not see the boy which his vehicle struck until the moment of the impact, that driver has not rebutted the presumption of fault which the statute imposes on him.\nIt was not, in my view, negligence per se for him to stop in line with the rear of the bus nor was it negligence per se to drive so closely (about 18 inches) to the left side of the bus as he says he did as he moved forward toward the crossing after receiving the traffic officer's signal, but having elected to stop where he did in a position where his visibility of pedestrian traffic from the west was restricted by the bus, and having elected to hug the left side of the bus when there was ample room and no other traffic between his vehicle and the centre of the street, he was under a heavy duty to be on the lookout for school children who might emerge from in front of the bus. Had he been keeping the lookout which the special circumstances then existing demanded, he would have seen the boy before the vehicle was actually in contact with him.\nThe traffic officer's signal did not relieve him from his duty to keep a sharp lookout for school children who might emerge from in front of the bus. The statement by Lord du Parcq in London Passenger Transport Board v. Upson[4] as follows:\nA driver is never entitled to assume that people will not do what his experience and common sense teach him that they are in fact likely to do.\nis especially applicable here.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal and enter judgment for the appellant \u00e8s qualit\u00e9 in the sum of $8,980.60 as fixed by Owen J. with interest and with costs in this Court and in the Courts below.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, HALL J. dissenting.\nAttorneys for the plaintiff, appellant: Leblanc, Delorme, Barnard, Leblanc, B\u00e9dard & Fournier, Sherbrooke.\nAttorneys for the defendant, respondent: Taschereau, Dussault & Drouin, Quebec.\n[1] [1964] Que.

The defendant supplied the ship and crew. The employees of the plaintiff assisted in loading and stowing heavy equipment which made up a part of the cargo. About three hours out of port a heavy mechanical shovel broke loose and was lost overboard. The action to recover the value of the mechanical shovel was maintained by the trial judge. The defendant appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe loss was occasioned by the failure of the lashings. The defendant argued that the mechanical shovel had been stowed on board by the plaintiff's own employees, and that the plaintiff was estopped from making a claim based on improper and negligent stowage. Under both the law of Quebec and of England, the primary duty of stowing cargo in a ship rests upon the owner of the ship and its master unless there is an express agreement to the contrary or the circumstances give rise to an implication that such an agreement has been made. This was a contract to carry the plaintiff's goods in the defendant's ship between specified ports and not a contract for \"letting of the ship\" which could have created the relationship of bailor and bailee between the parties. The absence of any provision in the charterparty making the plaintiff liable for stowage, and the inspection made by the ship's officers of the way in which the shovel was placed and secured on the deck and their approval thereof was evidence negating any implied agreement to relieve the defendant of the obligation imposed upon it to receive the goods and carefully arrange and stow them in the ship.\nNavigation\u2014Contrat de charte\u2014partie pour voyage determin\u00e9\u2014Le d\u00e9fendeur devant fournir le b\u00e2timent et l'\u00e9quipage\u2014Contrat de transport d'effets et d'outillage\u2014Les employ\u00e9s de L'affr\u00e9teur aidant \u00e0 l\u2019arrimage de l'outillage\u2014Pesante machine faisant partie de la cargaison et tombant \u00e0 la mer durant une temp\u00eate\u2014Responsabilit\u00e9\u2014Code Civil, art. 2424.\nLe demandeur passa un contrat de charte-partie pour voyage d\u00e9termin\u00e9 avec le d\u00e9fendeur.

Wellandoc when that vessel encountered heavy, but not unseasonable, weather on a voyage between Baie Comeau and Bagotville on December 9, 1954.\nIt is not disputed that the shovel in question which was a heavy piece of equipment weighing approximately 87 tons was being carried pursuant to an agreement between the parties evidenced by a letter addressed by the appellant to the respondent in the following terms:\nMannix Limited, November 30th, 1954.\n660 St. Catherine St. W.,\nMontreal, P.Q.\nAttention Mr. G. J. Pollock\nDear Sirs:\nAs per our agreement the SS \"WELLANDOC\" will be provided to carry out a voyage on your behalf from Montreal 1, P.Q. to Mont Louis, P.Q., Baie Comeau, P.Q. and Bagotville, P.Q., and return to Montreal, P.Q., or Cornwall, Ont., if possible, under the following terms and conditions.\n1. Cargos to consist of steel outbound and contractors' equipment inbound with no dangerous cargo permitted unless arranged for.\n2. Charterers to have full use of ship's gear as on board.\n3. Charterers to pay for all extra insurances on the vessel during the term of this charter. Extra meaning everything additional to insurances normally carried on this vessel prior to November 30th, 1954.\n4. Owners to provide this vessel fully manned, victualled and fueled at a daily rate of hire of $900.00 or pro rata thereof. Hire payable in advance on the estimated term of the charter and to be adjusted in full immediately upon redelivery.\n5. Delivery of the vessel to date from the hour the vessel clears Elevator 2 Montreal today with redelivery on the date and time when the vessel is safely returned to Montreal, cleaned and free of cargo.\n6. Charterers to be responsible for any and all damage caused through cargo handling at any or all ports and to make good said damage before the vessel is accepted at redelivery.\nYours very truly,\nN. M. PATERSON & SONS LIMITED\n(sgd.) I. C. McEwen\nAccepted: Traffic Manager.\nMannix Limited. No bill of lading was issued with respect to this shipment and both parties agree that the provisions of the Water Carriage of Goods Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 291, do not affect the matter.\nA great deal of the evidence at trial was devoted to describing the way in which the shovel was loaded and secured on the vessel, but I do not find it necessary to examine this evidence in detail as I agree with the learned trial judge that:\nThe preponderance of the proof is that the stowage and method of securing the Plaintiff's shovel were inadequate and bad, having regard to the weight, and dimensions of the machine and the weather conditions which might reasonably have been anticipated at that time of the year in that area. That such was the case would appear moreover, from the fact that in a little over three hours after leaving Baie Comeau, the shovel began to move and the lashings, which were intended to secure it, parted and the Plaintiff's shovel went overboard.\nThe italics are my own.\nIt was contended on behalf of the appellant that the finding of the learned trial judge with respect to improper stowage was vitiated by the fact that he allowed himself to be influenced by the evidence of Mr. Eric Crocker who was called as an expert witness on behalf of the respondent and who, in the appellant's submission, could not be impartial as he represented cargo underwriters interested in the loss. The unanimous opinion of this Court, which was expressed at the hearing of the appeal, is that this circumstance can only affect the weight to be attached to Mr. Crocker's evidence which was essentially a matter to be determined by the learned trial judge.\nThe main argument advanced in support of the appeal was that the improper and negligent stowage of the cargo, to which the learned trial judge attributed the loss, was the work of the respondent's own servants and that the respondent was accordingly estopped from enforcing any claim based thereon.\nI am satisfied on all the evidence that the respondent's employees under the direction of their foreman, Mr. Bellfontaine, did the major part of the work of lashing and securing this heavy cargo to the deck, but it is equally clear to me that the method which they employed was approved by the owner's agents aboard the vessel.\nThe master of the Wellandoc, Captain R. M. McCurdy, did not give evidence at the trial but a statement made by him on the 21st of December, 1954, was admitted as part of the defendant's case and the circumstances under which the loading took place are accepted in the factum filed on behalf of the respondent as having \"been carefully summarized\" in the following excerpt from that statement:\nAll equipment required for the stowage was supplied by Mannix Limited and we had nothing to do with the securing of the cargo. The method of stowage passed the inspection of all three mates and of the Mannix people ashore. The method of stowage was thoroughly discussed by all concerned and everybody gave his own views and the method adopted was the result of these discussions as incorporating the best ideas of everyone.\nSome question was raised in the Court below as to whether the law of Quebec or the law of England should be applied in the circumstances, but as the learned trial judge has pointed out, this question does not arise in the present case it having been conceded that the same rules apply under both systems of law. It follows that nothing herein contained is to be construed as deciding this question.\nUnder both the law of Quebec and the law of England it appears to be established that the primary duty of stowing cargo in a ship lies on the owner of that ship and on the master as his representative unless there is an express agreement to the contrary or the circumstances give rise to an implication that such an agreement has been made. This is made plain by reference to art. 2424 of the Civil Code of Quebec and to the English authorities, the effect of which is in my view accurately summarized in the reasons for judgment of Lord Wright in Canadian Transport Co. v. Court Line Ld.[4] Article 2424 of the Civil Code reads as follows:\n2424. The master is obliged to receive the goods, and carefully arrange and stow them in the ship, and to sign such bills of lading as may be required by the freighter or lessee, according to article 2420, upon receiving from him the receipts given for the goods.\nIn the case of Canadian Transport Co. v. Court Line Ld., supra, there was an express agreement incorporated in the charterparty that the charterers were \"to load, stow and trim the cargo at their expense under the supervision of the captain \u2026\" and as there was no evidence of the extent if any of the captain's supervision or approval, the charterers were found liable for improper stowage, but in reviewing the law as to the respective duties of an owner and a charterer in relation to stowage of cargo, Lord Wright said at page 943:\nIt is, apart from special provisions or circumstances, part of the ship's duty to stow the goods properly, not only in the interests of the seaworthiness of the vessel, but in order to avoid damages to the goods, and also to avoid loss of space or dead freight owing to bad stowage. In modern times the work of stowage is generally deputed to stevedores, but that does not generally relieve the shipowners of their duty, even though the stevedores are under the charterparty to be appointed by the charterers, unless there are special provisions which either expressly or inferentially have that effect.\nThe appellant's counsel cited a number of English cases in which the shipper was held responsible for damage resulting from faulty stowage but it will be found in each of these cases either that there was an express provision in the charterparty whereby the shipper undertook to stow the cargo or that he had participated or approved of a method of stowage, the defects in which were, or should have been, obvious to him having regard to his knowledge of the special properties of the goods which were being shipped.\nThe most recent case of this type that I have been able to find is Upper Egypt Produce Exporters and others v. Santamana[5] , a decision of Hill J. in the Admiralty Division in England which was strongly relied on by the appellant's counsel. In that case the cargo was a large shipment of onions a part of which had, with the assistance and approval of the shipper, been stacked in tiers 15 or 16 feet high with the result that the lower tiers were unable to withstand the pressure from above and were squashed and spoiled. The shipper of the cargo was in a much better position to know of the likelihood of it being damaged by this method of stowage than the ship owner or the master and it appears to me to be logical that in such a case a shipper who knows or ought to know the special characteristics of his own cargo and who approves of it being stowed in a manner which is obviously likely to expose it to damage cannot later hold the ship owner responsible for the damage which ensues. In the course of his reasons for judgment, after reviewing the relevant authorities, Hill J. went on to say: I have considered these cases very carefully. They seem to me to carry the law at least far enough to show that a shipper who takes an active interest in the stowage and complains of some defects but makes no complaints of others which are patent to him cannot be heard to complain of that to which he has made no objection.\nThe italics are my own.\nThe same considerations governed the case of Bozzo v. Moffat et al[6] upon which the appellant also relied. This was a case in which a shipment of wool had been stowed against the skin of the ship without sufficient dunnage to protect it from dampness with the result that it was damaged by water, and it was held that under the charter-party there in question whereby the shippers reserved the right to employ and did employ their own stevedores in loading the vessel, the owner was relieved of liability. The effect of this line of cases appears to me to be accurately and succinctly summarized in art. 51 of Scrutton on Charterparties, 17th ed., page 148, where he says:\nA shipper who takes an active interest in the stowage cannot afterwards be heard to complain of patent defects in the stowage of which he made no complaint at the time.\nThe italics are my own.\nIn the present case it was not the condition of the cargo but the stability of the ship that was affected by the faulty stowage, and the loss was occasioned by the failure of the lashings which secured the shovel to withstand the strain to which they were subjected by reason of the shovel's movement in the heavy seas which were encountered. One of Mr. Crocker's main objections to the method of loading was that it was likely to increase the rapidity of the roll of the ship and his opinion that the shovel was not properly secured to the deck was predicated on the assumption that fairly rough weather would be encountered. These do not appear to me to be circumstances which should have been obvious to the respondent's employees as they were not in the same position as the master or his crew to know the extent to which the ship would roll or the seas which it would be likely to encounter.\nIt therefore appears to me that in the absence of any provision in the charterparty making the shippers responsible for stowage, the inspection made by the ship's officers of the way in which the shovel was placed and secured on the deck and their approval of it, is evidence negating any implied agreement to relieve the carrier of the obligation imposed upon it by law \"to receive the goods and carefully arrange and stow them in the ship.\"\nIt was further argued on behalf of the appellant that the second paragraph of the agreement governing this shipment carried with it the implication that the charterers were to be responsible for stowage. That paragraph merely provides for the \"charterers to have full use of the ship's gear as on board\" and I do not consider that these words can be treated as relieving the owner of any of its responsibility for stowing the cargo.\nIt was further contended on the appellant's behalf that the agreement governing this shipment was a contract for the letting of the ship as distinguished from a contract for her services, and that in so far as the crew of the vessel participated in the stowage of the cargo, they were to be regarded as servants of the charterer. This contention was based in great measure on the case of Thomas P. Beal[7] where Wooley, Ct. Judge had occasion to say:\nOrdinarily the owner charters only the space; the ship continues in the possession, management and control of the owner and its officers and crew. But in this case of a time charterer, the charterer, in chartering the space, chartered the whole reach of the ship; the owner in terms put at 'the charterer's disposal' her 'holds, decks and usual places of loading'.\nAnd the same judge later said:\nThe terms of the charter party make it certain there was a letting of the ship, as distinguished from a contract for her services. In the former case, the relation between owner and charterer becomes that of bailor and bailee; whereas, in the latter, the relation is that of carrier and shipper.\nThis contention appears to me to be without merit because in my opinion the agreement here in question is a voyage charter and not a time charter and it is to be construed as a contract to carry the respondent's goods in the appellant's ship between the ports specified therein and not as a contract for the \"letting of the ship\" which could create the relationship of bailor and bailee between the parties.\nFinally, appellants contended that the loss was occasioned by \"dangers of navigation\" and that the circumstances were accordingly governed by art. 2433 of the Civil Code which reads, in part, as follows: 2433. The owner of a sea-going ship is not liable for the loss or damage, occasioned to any goods, wares, merchandise and article of any kind on board any such vessel or delivered to him for conveyance therein, without his actual fault or privity or the fault or neglect of his agents, servants or employees:\n1. By reason of fire or the dangers of navigation; \u2026.\nIn this regard, I think that the phrase \"dangers of navigation\" is to be given the meaning attached to the words \"perils of the sea\" by Sir Lyman Duff in Canadian National Steamships v. Bayliss[8] , where he said, speaking on behalf of this Court.\nThe issue raised by this defence (perils of the sea) was, of course, an issue of fact and it was incumbent upon the appellants to acquit themselves of the onus of showing that the weather encountered was the cause of the damage and that it was of such a nature that the danger of damage to the cargo arising from it could not have been foreseen or guarded against as one of the probable incidents of the voyage.\nIn my opinion the evidence discloses that the weather which was encountered by the Wellandoc on the 9th of December, although it was rough, was of a kind which an experienced master should have foreseen as a probable incident of such a voyage at that time of year. I am accordingly satisfied that the provisions of art. 2433 of the Civil Code could have no application to these circumstances.\nIt should perhaps be mentioned that although Mr. Crocker expressed the opinion that the ship was unseaworthy, there is no suggestion that the loss was occasioned by unseaworthiness and the question therefore does not arise.\nFor all these reasons I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Beauregard, Brisset & Reycraft, Montreal.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Lalande, Bri\u00e8re, Reeves & Paquette, Montreal.\n[1] [1965] 2 Ex.

All the patents related to defined new sulfonyl ureas, each patent claiming a different process of producing them. Each patent contained a claim (claim 10 in all but the last patent and claim 13 in the last patent) to a specific new sulfonyl urea, tolbutamide, whenever obtained by the process claimed in claim 1 of the patent. The unexpected utility stated in the patents was the capacity of lowering blood sugar levels. The defendants contended that the process claims in each of the patents were invalid as being too broad in their terms, and, in consequence, the claim to the substance tolbutamide could not stand for that reason. The action was dismissed at trial on the ground that the patents alleged to have been infringed were invalid. The plaintiff companies appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nClaim 1 of each of the patents in question was too wide in scope. The claimants sought to cover every conceivable sulfonyl ureas of the class, and in so doing it had overclaimed and invalidated claim 1 in each patent. Claim 10 in the first 9 patents and claim 13 in the last patent could stand only upon the foundation of a valid process claim and that foundation did not exist here.\nBrevets\u2014Contrefa\u00e7on\u2014Validit\u00e9\u2014Revendications trop \u00e9tendues\u2014Loi sur les Brevets, S.R.C. 1952, c. 203.\nLes compagnies demanderesses ont institu\u00e9 contre les compagnies d\u00e9fenderesses une action pour contrefa\u00e7on de dix brevets, dont le premier avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9livr\u00e9 sur une demande originale et les autres sur des demandes divisionnaires pour une invention intitul\u00e9e \u00ab Process of Preparing Benzenesulfonyl Ureas \u00bb.

Appel rejet\u00e9.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Thurlow J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada[2] , dismissing an action for infringement of patents. Appeal dismissed.\nChristopher Robinson, Q.C., and Russell S. Smart, for the plaintiffs, appellants.\nI. Goldsmith, for the defendants, respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nHALL J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of Thurlow J. in the Exchequer Court of Canada[3] , dismissing an action by the appellants for infringement of Patents No. 582,621 to 582,627 inclusive; 558,513; 558,514 and 590,201, being in respect of:\nan invention entitled \"Manufacture of New Sulphonyl Ureas\". Each of the patents contains a claim (numbered 10 of the first 9 of the patents and numbered 13 in the last) which reads: The compound of the formula\nwhenever obtained according to claim 1 or the obvious chemical equivalent thereof\nPatent No. 582,621 issued on a parent application which had its origin in what is called a priority document being an application for a patent of invention under the title \"PROCESS OF PREPARING BENZENESULFONYL UREAS\" filed at the Patent Office of the Federal Republic of Germany on August 8, 1955, by the appellant The Farbwerke Hoechst Aktiengesellschaft vormals Meister Lucius & Bruning. The other patents issued on divisional applications of that parent application which were filed pursuant to s. 38(2) of the Patent Act. In all respects material in this appeal, the disclosures of all the patents are identical.\nAll the patents relate to defined new sulfonyl ureas, each patent claiming a different process of producing them. Each of the processes produces the new substances by known methods from known materials, with the result that the patentability of the process depends on the possession of unexpected utility by the new substances produced. The unexpected utility stated in the patents is the capacity of lowering blood sugar levels, this being referred to as hypoglycemic activity. The process in each patent is claimed in claim 1 in relation to the production of all the new sulfonyl ureas. Each patent contains a claim (claim 10 in all but the last patent and claim 13 in the last patent) to a specific new sufonyl urea, tolbutamide, whenever obtained by the process claimed in claim 1 of the patent. It is upon this claim to tolbutamide in each patent that the appellant founded its action for infringement.\nIt is conceded that tolbutamide, standing by itself, could have been the subject-matter of a valid patent if claimed as such when prepared or produced by the methods or processes of manufacture particularly described and claimed in the patent or by their obvious chemical equivalent. It possessed the previously undiscovered useful quality as defined in Re May & Baker Ltd. and Ciba Limited[4] and adopted by this Court in Commissioner of Patents v. Ciba[5] . However, the respondents say that the process claims in each of the patents in question are invalid as being too broad in their terms, and, in consequence, the claim to the substance tolbutamide cannot stand for that reason.\nThurlow J. dealt with the substance tolbutamide in his judgment as follows at p. 713:\nThe value and importance of tolbutamide lies in its usefulness in the treatment of diabetes. Until shortly before its introduction in the latter part of 1956 treatment of the common form of this illness, known as diabetes mellitis, consisted mainly, if not entirely, in putting the patient on a diet designed to bring about and maintain a proper level of sugar in his blood and if this was not successful or sufficient to accomplish the desired result, to administer insulin. Insulin could not be taken orally and thus had the disadvantages associated with administration by needle including those due to the reluctance of the patient and those due to his own shortcomings when administering it himself resulting in administering at times too much and at other times too little. Insulin also had undesirable effects on the tissue adjoining the site of injections carried out over a long period. Early in 1956 a substance known as carbutamide which was known to have blood sugar lowering activity, and which had bacteriostatic activity as well, came into use as an oral antidiabetic. The bacteriostatic activity was undesirable as it tended to destroy bacteria necessary to normal body functions and in October 1956 carbutamide was withdrawn from use in Canada and the United States apparently because of reported undesirable long term effects on the livers and kidneys of patients by whom it had been used. Tolbutamide had already been synthesized and, to some extent, tested before carbutamide was introduced and shortly before the latter was withdrawn it came into use in Canada for the same purpose. The evidence of Dr. J. B. R. McKendry satisfies me that tolbutamide has proven to be a satisfactory oral antidiabetic and has been of considerable value in the treatment of many cases where dieting alone has been insufficient to establish and maintain a proper blood sugar level. Since its introduction at least two other oral antidiabetics have come into use for the same purpose one of which, chlorpropamide, has more pronounced and longer lasting blood sugar lowering activity than tolbutamide but at the same time involves increased danger of undesirable long term effects. These substances are not suitable for the treatment of all types of diabetes nor are they effective for all patients or for what I shall call the severe cases of diabetes mellitis. For these insulin remains the standard remedy. But in a considerable proportion of the cases of diabetes mellitis tolbutamide is effective as a blood sugar lowering agent, and has the advantage of oral administration, and at the same time a satisfactory record of comparatively low toxicity and freedom from harmful side effects.\nHe then made an exhaustive review of the combinations possible, using the substances from which tolbutamide is produced, and concluded at p. 723:\nIt will be observed that the number of mathematically conceivable substances embraced in the class defined in this claim is infinite. More than one hundred substances are conceivable by taking any one of the left hand or R substituents and applying all the possible variations of the finite class defined for the right hand or R1 group. A group many times the size of that number is also conceivable by applying it to the various substituents embraced within the finite portions of the left hand or R group. But in using the expressions \"alkyl\" and \"alkoxy\" and in embracing both single substituents in the phenyl ring in any of three positions and combinations of any two substituents in any two positions the language places no mathematical limit whatever on the number of carbon atoms or the formations thereof which such groups can have and thus makes the number of members of the class mathematically infinite. Nor is there evidence of how many members of this class are conceivable either as a matter of practical chemistry or for the purposes of practical commercial manufacture. As a matter of interpretation however it is in my opinion clear that the claim refers to every mathematically conceivable sulphonyl urea of the class for I can see no basis upon which anyone who might contrive to make a substance of the class, however inconceivable the preparation of such a substance may have been at the time of the drafting of the claim, could successfully maintain that his substance was not within the class. But even if the claim were read as referring only to those members of the class which as a matter of chemistry or even of commercial manufacture could conceivably be made, I see no reason to doubt that it would refer to a class many thousands strong.\nThe appellant did not seriously contest these findings, but maintained that insofar as the one substance in issue in the litigation, namely, tolbutamide, the patents were valid and were being infringed by the respondents.\nIn C. H. Boehringer Sohn v. Bell-Craig Limited[6] Martland J., in delivering the judgment of the Court, said at pp. 414-5:\nIn the present case there was a claim to a process upon which the appellant relies as being a compliance with the subsection. That claim is claim 1, which is admittedly invalid because it is too broad in its terms and claims more than the appellant was entitled to claim. The question is whether a claimant can satisfy the requirements of s. 41(1) for a claim for a substance, if he has filed a broad process claim for the production of a whole genus of which the substance claimed is but one, if the process claim, because of its generality, is found to be invalid.\nIn my opinion, he cannot meet the provisions of that subsection in that way. The subsection was intended to place strict limitations upon claims for substances produced by chemical process intended for food or medicine. Such a substance cannot be claimed by itself. It can only be claimed when produced by a particular process of manufacture. Not only that, the claimant must claim, not only the substance, but that very process by which it is manufactured. To comply with the subsection he must, therefore, make two claims. In my opinion this means that he must make valid claims to both the process and the substance, if he is to be entitled, successfully, to claim the latter. To interpret the subsection as meaning that all that is necessary is to file a claim for the process, valid or not, would be to defeat its purpose. A person who claims a substance within the subsection, supported only by a process claim which is invalid, is in no better position then was the respondent in the Winthrop (1948) S.C.R. 46, 2 D.L.R. 561, 7 Fox Pat. C. 183, 7 C.P.R. 58 case, who, while referring to a process, had not claimed it. In the Winthrop case the claimant had claimed too little. In the present case he has claimed too much. But the result in each case is the same in that there had been no claim filed which results in the claimant's obtaining a valid patented process for the production of the substance which he claims.\nThis statement applies to the present case. In challenging the validity of the patents in question, counsel for the respondents put his case upon the footing that no one could obtain a valid patent for an unproved and untested hypothesis in an uncharted field. This is what the appellant has tried to do in claim 1 of each of the patents. It has sought to cover, in the words of Thurlow J., \"every mathematically conceivable sulphonyl urea of the class\" and has consequently overclaimed, and, in so doing, invalidated claim 1 in each patent.\nAccordingly, following Boehringer and Winthrop1, claim 10 in the first nine patents and claim 13 in the last patent fall for they cannot stand except upon the foundation of a valid process claim and that foundation does not exist here.\nThe appeal should, therefore, be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, appellants: Smart & Biggar, Ottawa.\nSolicitors for the defendants, respondents: Duncan, Goldsmith & Caswell, Toronto.\n[1] [1965] 1 Ex.

Limited Respondent.\n1965: December 3; 1965: December 20.\nPresent: Cartwright, Fauteux, Martland, Ritchie and Hall JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nTaxation\u2014Customs and Excise\u2014Crane imported\u2014Whether of a class or kind not made in Canada\u2014Customs Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 58\u2014Customs Tariff, R.S.C. 1952, c. 60, s. 6(10), tariff items 427(1), 427a\u2014Order-in-Council P.C. 1618 dated July 2, 1936. The respondent company imported into Canada in parts a travelling level luffing jib type gantry crane for use in its dry dock at Saint John, N. B. The evidence showed that at least two Canadian manufacturers were at the relevant time capable of building a crane such as the one in question and were willing to undertake its construction but that no jib type travelling crane of the capacity and dimensions of the crane in question had previously been manufactured in Canada. A similar crane was built in Canada in 1959, but with a much lower lifting capacity. The Deputy Minister ruled that the crane was of a kind or class made in Canada and therefore subject to customs duty under item 427(1) of the Customs Tariff, R.S.C. 1952, c. 60. The respondent contended that the crane was classifiable under item 427a and hence entitled to entry free of duty.\nBy a majority decision, the Tariff Board ruled that the imported crane and the one made in Canada in 1959 were the two members making up a class of jib type travelling gantry cranes with a lifting capacity of 15 tons or more, and that the fact that the 1959 crane was made in Canada was sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the opening sentence of s. 6(10) of the Customs Tariff. The Exchequer Court held that the Board had erred and referred the matter back to the Tariff Board for a rehearing. The Deputy Minister was granted leave to appeal to this Court and the respondent company cross-appealed.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the cross-appeal dismissed.\nIn dealing with the matter, the Board was not restricted to the precise grounds on which the Deputy Minister had based his decision. Its task was to decide on the material before it under which item the imported crane should be classified. The Board made the findings necessary to support its declaration and there was no need to refer the matter back to it.\nThe Board did not err in law in its interpretation of s. 6(10) and P.C. 1618. Their combined effects provide that goods shall not be deemed to be of a class made in Canada unless at least 10 per cent of the normal Canadian consumption is so made. The Board's reasons show that it decided that one-half of the class was made in Canada and that this greatly exceeded the maximum fixed by the combined effect of the statute and order-in-council and rendered it unreasonable to hold that the imported crane was of a class not made in Canada.\nThe Board decided that the production in Canada of one crane of the class in the last fifteen years was production \"in substantial quantities\" within the meaning of that phrase as used in s. 6(10). Assuming that this question was one of law, the Board did not err in its answer. One is a substantial portion of two.\nThe dissenting opinion in the judgment of the Board was that the difference in lifting capacity between the two cranes was so great that the two could not be regarded as belonging to the same class. The view of the majority and that of the minority were both tenable, and the choice between them involved a finding of fact which it was for the Board to make and as to which its decision was not subject to review.\nRevenu\u2014Douanes et accise\u2014Grue import\u00e9e\u2014Est-elle de la classe ou esp\u00e8ce non fabriqu\u00e9e au Canada\u2014Loi sur les Douanes, S.R.C. 1952, c. 58\u2014Tarif des Douanes, S.R.C. 1952, c. 60, art. 6(10), item 427(1), 427a\u2014Arr\u00eat\u00e9 minist\u00e9riel C.P. 1618 en date du 2 juillet 1936. La compagnie intim\u00e9e importa au Canada par parties une grue portique \u00e0 fl\u00e8che et \u00e0 port\u00e9e variable pour usage dans sa cale s\u00e8che \u00e0 Saint-Jean, N.-B. La preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'au moins deux fabricants canadiens \u00e9taient en mesure \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 de construire une telle grue et \u00e9taient consentants d'en faire la construction, mais qu'aucune grue roulante \u00e0 fl\u00e8che ayant la capacit\u00e9 et les dimensions de la grue en question avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fabriqu\u00e9e auparavant au Canada. Une grue semblable avait \u00e9t\u00e9 construite au Canada en 1959, mais elle avait une puissance de lev\u00e9e beaucoup moindre. Le sous-ministre classifia la grue comme \u00e9tant d'une classe ou esp\u00e8ce fabriqu\u00e9e au Canada et, en cons\u00e9quence, sujette \u00e0 des droits de douanes sous le r\u00e9gime de l'item 427(1) du Tarif des Douanes, S.R.C. 1952, c. 60. L'intim\u00e9e a pr\u00e9tendu que la grue devrait \u00eatre classifi\u00e9e sous l'item 427a et qu'elle avait droit par cons\u00e9quent d'entrer en franchise.\nPar une d\u00e9cision majoritaire, la Commission du Tarif a jug\u00e9 que la grue import\u00e9e et celle fabriqu\u00e9e au Canada en 1959 \u00e9taient les deux membres constituant une classe de grues portiques roulantes \u00e0 fl\u00e8che ayant une puissance de lev\u00e9e de 15 tonnes ou plus, et que le fait que la grue de 1959 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fabriqu\u00e9e au Canada \u00e9tait suffisant pour satisfaire les dispositions de la premi\u00e8re phrase de l'art. 6(10) du Tarif des Douanes. La Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier a jug\u00e9 que la Commission avait err\u00e9 et a d\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 la question \u00e0 la Commission du Tarif pour une nouvelle audition. Le sous-ministre a obtenu permission d'appeler devant cette Cour et la compagnie intim\u00e9e porta contre-appel.\nArr\u00eat: L'appel doit \u00eatre maintenu et le contre-appel rejet\u00e9.\nDans le traitement de la question, la Commission n'\u00e9tait pas restreinte aux motifs pr\u00e9cis sur lesquels le sous-ministre avait bas\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision. Sa t\u00e2che \u00e9tait de d\u00e9cider sous quel item la grue import\u00e9e devait \u00eatre classifi\u00e9e en se basant sur les faits qui lui \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s. La Commission est arriv\u00e9e aux conclusions n\u00e9cessaires pour supporter sa d\u00e9claration et il n'y avait pas lieu de lui d\u00e9f\u00e9rer la question.\nLa Commission n'a pas err\u00e9 en droit dans son interpr\u00e9tation de l'art. 6(10) et du C.P. 1618. Par l'effet combin\u00e9 de ces deux dispositions il est stipul\u00e9 que les marchandises ne seront pas cens\u00e9es appartenir \u00e0 une classe fabriqu\u00e9e au Canada \u00e0 moins que 10 pour cent de la consommation normale canadienne ne soit ainsi fabriqu\u00e9e. L'opinion \u00e9mise par la Commission d\u00e9montre qu'elle a jug\u00e9 que la moiti\u00e9 de la classe \u00e9tait fabriqu\u00e9e au Canada et que cela exc\u00e9dait grandement le maximum fix\u00e9 par l'effet combin\u00e9 du statut et de l'arr\u00eat\u00e9 minist\u00e9riel, et rendait d\u00e9raisonnable le point de vue que la grue import\u00e9e \u00e9tait de la classe non fabriqu\u00e9e au Canada.\nLa Commission a jug\u00e9 que la production au Canada d'une grue de la classe, dans les derniers quinze ans, \u00e9tait une production \u00ab en quantit\u00e9s importantes \u00bb dans le sens que cette phrase est employ\u00e9e dans l'art. 6(10). Assumant que cette question en \u00e9tait une de droit, la Commission n'a pas commis d'erreur dans la r\u00e9ponse. Une grue est une partie importante de deux.\nL'opinion dissidente dans le jugement de la Commission \u00e9tait \u00e0 l'effet que la diff\u00e9rence dans la puissance de lev\u00e9e entre les deux grues \u00e9tait tellement grande que les deux grues ne pouvaient pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme appartenant \u00e0 la m\u00eame classe. Le point de vue de la majorit\u00e9 et celui de la minorit\u00e9 \u00e9taient tous deux soutenables, et le choix entre les deux n\u00e9cessitait une conclusion de fait qui \u00e9tait du domaine de la Commission et dont la d\u00e9cision n'est pas sujette \u00e0 revision. APPEL par la Couronne et contre-appel par l'intim\u00e9e d'un jugement de Juge Thurlow de la Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier du Canada[1] maintenant un appel de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission du Tarif. Appel maintenu et contre-appel rejet\u00e9.\nAPPEAL by the Deputy Minister and cross-appeal by the respondent from a judgment of Thurlow J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada[2] , allowing an appeal from a decision of the Tariff Board. Appeal allowed and cross-appeal dismissed.\nC. R. O. Munro, Q.C., and D. H. Aylen, for the appellant, the Deputy Minister.\nA. Forget, Q.C., for the appellants, Dominion Bridge Ltd. and Provincial Engineering Ltd.\nE. N. McKelvey, Q.C., and J. R. Richard, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This is an appeal, brought pursuant to leave granted by my brother Fauteux, from a judgment[3] of Thurlow J. allowing an appeal from a declaration of the Tariff Board made on May 1, 1964, and referring the matter back to the Tariff Board for a re-hearing.\nThe declaration of the Board upheld a ruling of the Deputy Minister that a crane which the respondent imported in parts from Scotland in 1961 and 1962 and erected at its dry dock at Saint John, New Brunswick, was to be classified under item 427(1) of the Customs Tariff and rejected the contention of the respondent that it should be classified under item 427a. It is common ground that the imported parts fall within one or other of these items which read as follows:\n427(1) All machinery composed wholly or in part of iron or steel, n.o.p., parts of the foregoing.\n427a. All machinery composed wholly or in part of iron or steel, n.o.p. of a class or kind not made in Canada, complete parts of the foregoing.\nThe question which the Board was called upon to determine was whether the crane was of a class or kind not made in Canada. The Board decided that it was not of that class or kind and was therefore subject to duty at the rate of 10 per cent under item 427(1). If the crane had been held to fall within item 427a it would have been admitted free of duty.\nThe appellants ask that the declaration of the Board be restored. The respondent cross-appeals and asks for a declaration that the crane be classified under item 427a. None of the parties before us asked that there be a re-hearing by the Board.\nThe crane in question is a travelling electrically driven level luffing jib type gantry crane.\nThe Board made the following findings of fact which are supported by the evidence. The imported crane is a travelling monotower, thus described because of a single towerlike base; it has a self-contained power plant; it can negotiate, on its rails, curves as sharp as 500 feet in radius; it is equipped with a level-luffing feature whereby the load carried remains at the same level while the jib of the crane is moved up or down through its vertical arc; it has a high lift of 300 feet; it is equipped with Sta-creep control for accurate and slow movement; it is counterweighted to reduce its power requirement; it has an auxiliary hoist for the more rapid lifting of lesser loads; it weighs over 750 long tons; it has a lifting capacity ranging from 75 long tons, or 84 short tons, at 115 feet to 20 long tons at 160 feet. Cranes of this nature are not produced in large numbers of identical units as are automobiles and many other articles. In part this is due to their great cost and size; in part it is also due to the fact that each purchaser's requirements differ from those of any other. The market is essentially one of construction to well-defined requirements and specifications upon which agreement is reached before construction is begun. To increase lifting capacity or radius of carriage sturdier construction may be necessary but no basic change in the principle of design is required.\nThe evidence shewed that various types of cranes have from time to time been manufactured in Canada, some of which, notably those of the overhead bridge type, had lifting capacities considerably in excess of 84 tons and that at least two Canadian manufacturers were at the relevant time capable of building a crane such as the one in question and were willing to undertake its construction but that no jib type travelling crane of the capacity and dimensions of the crane in question had previously been manufactured in Canada. Prior to 1945 a number of electrically driven jib type travelling cranes had been built in Canada for use in shipbuilding and ship repair work some of which had lifting capacities up to 40 tons at a radius of 50 feet. What the capacity of these cranes would have been at radii of 115 and 160 feet does not appear. These cranes did not have the capacity of maintaining the level of the load when luffing. An electrically driven level luffing jib type travelling crane was, however, built in Canada by Provincial Engineering Limited in 1959 and was installed for use in shipbuilding and repair work at Port Weller, Ontario. It has a maximum lifting capacity of 55 short tons at a radius of 47 feet which declines to 18 tons at 110 feet and to 5 tons at 115 feet.\nThe position taken by the Deputy Minister before the Tariff Board, the Exchequer Court and this Court is that the class of which the imported crane is a member is that of jib type travelling gantry cranes with a lifting capacity of 15 tons or more. In the 15 years preceding the date of the hearing before the Board only one crane of that class was made in Canada, the one at Port Weller referred to above, and only one was imported that is the crane in question.\nThe ruling of the Deputy Minister was set out in a letter to the respondent dated September 11, 1962, reading as follows:\nYour representations have received careful consideration but the Department considers the 75 ton electric travelling level luffing shipyard crane, per specifications submitted, to be of a class or kind made in Canada by Dominion Bridge Company Limited, Montreal and Provincial Engineering Limited, Niagara Falls.\nIt is my understanding that these companies have manufactured and supplied cranes over the years for installation in various shipyards in Canada and are still very much interested in building such machines on receipt of firm orders.\nIn view of the foregoing, I have no alternative other than to rule this crane of a class or kind made in Canada and dutiable under tariff item 427(1), at 10% ad valorem, under the British Preferential Tariff.\nThe ruling was reiterated in two subsequent letters.\nThe reasons of the majority of the Board conclude as follows:\nThe lifting capacity of the imported crane therefore exceeds that of the Port Weller crane by 29 short tons or over 50%. This excess is substantial. However in the market of very heavy cranes built only to purchaser's specifications there must be breadth in the application of criteria of similarity in the establishment of the class or kind distinction.\nIn the present case the Board finds that for the purposes of this appeal the capacities of these two jib travelling gantry cranes are similar enough that it was not unreasonable for the respondent to include these two cranes in a class of jib type travelling gantry cranes with a lifting capacity of 15 tons or more.\nThe evidence of production and consumption, both confidential and public, may be summarized as follows. Were the class or kind to include only these two cranes, the 10 per cent of Canadian consumption fixed by Order in Council as sufficient to represent 'substantial' production in Canada within the meaning of subsection (10) of Section 6 of the Customs Tariff would be exceeded; if the class were enlarged to include cranes of lesser capacity, even as low as 6 tons, the evidence reveals that, throughout, the percentage of Canadian production would be even more substantial and consequently be more than sufficient to classify the cranes as being of a class or kind made in Canada.\nThe Board, therefore, declares that the imported crane is not 'of a class or kind not made in Canada'.\nAccordingly, the appeal is dismissed.\nMr. Gerry, who dissented, stated that he agreed with the decision of the majority except as to the last four paragraphs. The gist of his reasons is contained in the following passage:\nIt seems to me to run directly contrary to the intention of the legislation to classify the imported crane as being of a class or kind made in Canada when it possesses the lifting capacity necessary to perform a task which no jib type travelling gantry crane in fact made in Canada, had anywhere near the capacity to perform.\nI am of the opinion that the upper lifting capacity limit of the class or kind deemed to be made in Canada must be determined in the vicinity of the upper limit of lifting capacity of the jib type travelling gantry cranes, in fact made in Canada.\nBefore considering the reasons of Thurlow J. it will be convenient to set out the wording of s. 6(10) of the Customs Tariff, R.S.C. 1952, c. 60, and of P.C. 1618. These read as follows:\n6. (10) For the purpose of this Act goods shall not be deemed to be of a class or kind made or produced in Canada unless so made or produced in substantial quantities; and the Governor in Council may provide that such quantities, to be substantial, shall be sufficient to supply a certain percentage of the normal Canadian consumption and may fix such percentages.\nOrder in Council P.C. 1618 of July 2nd, 1936.\nArticles shall not be deemed to be of a class or kind made or produced in Canada unless a quantity sufficient to supply ten per centum of the normal Canadian consumption of such article is so made or produced.\nAfter summarizing the facts and the reasons of the majority of the Board, Thurlow J. stated that the first ground of attack in the Board's declaration was that \"because of the very substantial differences between the only Canadian made crane even remotely comparable, viz., the Port Weller crane, and the crane in question\" the only reasonable determination open to the Board was that the imported crane was of a class or kind not made in Canada and consequently the Board's finding was not sustainable in point of law on the material which was before it.\nThurlow J., in my opinion correctly, would have rejected this ground of attack for the reasons which he expressed as follows:\nAs the question of the limits of the class or kind of goods made in Canada into which a particular article may fall is one of fact\u2014vide Dominion Engineering Works Ltd. v. D.M.N.R. et al.\u2014to be resolved on such criteria appearing from the evidence as the Board regards as appropriate to the particular goods and as neither distinctions of size nor of capacity are necessarily conclusive on a question of this kind, I do not think that it can be said that on the material before the Board in this case the Board was necessarily required to classify cranes by sizes or by particular lifting capacities, or that a finding that the crane in question was one of a 'class of jib type travelling gantry cranes with a lifting capacity of 15 tons or more' would be so unreasonable as to be not supportable in law.\nHowever, having said this, the learned Judge continued:\nBut I have been unable to satisfy myself that the majority of the Board has so found. What the declaration says is that the Board finds that it was not unreasonable for the Deputy Minister to include the crane in such a class and in the following paragraph the majority of the Board proceeds to consider the ratio of Canadian production to Canadian consumption of cranes of that class (which would, of course, be relevant if such a finding had been made) and the ratio of Canadian production to Canadian consumption of a different class which could not be relevant if the finding had been made. On the other hand if this finding of a class has not been made there appears to me to be no finding in the declaration, of the class or kind of cranes in fact made in Canada into which the crane in question falls and in the absence of such a finding to establish the scope of the class or kind I am unable to see how the subsequent problems which arise on s. 6(10) could have been properly resolved.\nThe passage in the reasons of the Board referred to by the learned Judge has already been quoted. While its wording may not be altogether free from ambiguity I am satisfied that there are implicit in it the findings (i) that the imported crane and the Port Weller crane are the two members making up a class of jib type travelling gantry cranes with a lifting capacity of 15 tons or more, and (ii) that the fact that the Port Weller crane was made in Canada was sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the opening sentence of s. 6(10). I do not think these findings are vitiated because the Board went on to say that the same result would follow if it adopted another definition of the class or because the letter from the Deputy Minister, quoted above, did not define the class in the same terms as did the Board. In dealing with the matter the Board was not restricted to the precise grounds on which the Deputy Minister had based his decision. Its task was to decide on the material before it under which item the imported crane should be classified.\nIt follows from what I have said that, in my opinion, the Board made the findings necessary to support its declaration and there is no need to refer the matter back to it. There remains the question whether in reaching its decision the Board erred in law. Thurlow J. was of opinion that the Board had so erred in two respects.\nAfter quoting from the passage in the decision of the majority of the Board which has been set out above, the learned Judge continued:\nIf by this the majority of the Board meant, as I think they did that the effect of the Order-in-Council is that production of 10 per cent, of the Canadian consumption is necessarily production of \"substantial quantities\" within the meaning of s. 6(10) I am, with respect, of the opinion that they misdirected themselves on a material point of law and that their finding therefore cannot stand. On the other hand if the majority of the Board assumed or decided that production in Canada of one crane of the class in the course of the immediately preceding period of fifteen years was production in \"substantial quantities\" within the meaning of the first part of s. 6(10) I would also, with respect, have little difficulty in reaching the conclusion that such an assumption or finding was erroneous in point of law as being one which if properly instructed as to the law and acting judicially the Board could not reach.\nAs to the first of these suggested errors, with respect, I do not think that the Board erred in law in its interpretation of s. 6(10) and P.C. 1618. It will be observed that s. 6(10) empowers the Governor in Council to provide that the quantity of a class of goods made in Canada in order to be regarded as substantial shall be sufficient to supply a percentage, fixed by His Excellency, of the normal Canadian consumption. I agree with the submission of Mr. Forget that the effect of this is to enable the Governor in Council to define the expression \"substantial quantities\" used in the subsection. From this it follows that the combined effect of s. 6(10) and P.C. 1618 is to require s. 6(10) to be applied as if it read: For the purpose of this Act goods shall not be deemed to be of a class or kind made or produced in Canada unless so made or produced in quantities sufficient to supply ten per centum of the normal Canadian consumption of such goods.\nIt is true that this enactment is expressed in negative form. It provides that goods shall not be deemed to be of a class made in Canada unless at least ten per centum of the normal Canadian consumption is so made. It does not provide that if more than ten per centum is so made the goods shall of necessity be deemed to be of a class made in Canada. It might perhaps be error in law if the Board was of opinion that in the present case the production in Canada of one of the two cranes making up the class was not substantial production but considered itself bound by law to decide that it was; but I do not read the reasons of the Board as holding this. It appears to me that these reasons read as a whole shew that the Board decided that one half of the class it was considering was made in Canada and that this greatly exceeded the minimum fixed by the combined effect of the statute and Order-in-Council and rendered it unreasonable to hold that the imported crane was of a class not made in Canada.\nAs to the second suggested error, it is my opinion that the Board did decide that the production in Canada of one crane of the class in the last fifteen years was production \"in substantial quantities\" within the meaning of that phrase as used in s. 6(10). The word \"substantial\" as used in the subsection is a relative term. The question is whether the production in Canada during the relevant period was substantial in relation to the total Canadian consumption during that period. It in fact represented fifty per cent of that total. I incline to agree with Mr. Munro's submission that this was a question of fact for the Board to decide, but assuming that the question is one of law I do not think that the Board erred in its answer. One is a substantial portion of two.\nI have already quoted from the reasons of Mr. Gerry the ground on which he disagreed with the majority. In his opinion the difference in lifting capacity between the Port Weller crane and the imported crane was so great that the two could not be regarded as belonging to the same class. The difference is large and is accentuated if expressed in terms of \"overturning moment\" instead of maximum lifting capacity but it is dimensional rather than functional. On this point it appears to me that the view of the majority and that of the minority were both tenable and that the choice between them involved a finding of fact which it was for the Board to make and as to which its decision is not subject to review.\nI would allow the appeal, dismiss the cross-appeal and restore the declaration of the Tariff Board. The appellant the Deputy Minister of National Revenue for Customs and Excise will recover his costs in this Court and in the Exchequer Court from the respondent. There will be no order in either Court as to the costs of the other appellants.\nAppeal allowed with costs; cross-appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant, The Deputy Minister: E. A.

Dubiner, [1966] S.C.R. 206\nDate: 1965-12-14\nCheerio Toys and Games Limited (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nSamuel Dubiner (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1966: June 16, 17, 18; 1966: December 14.\nPresent: Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nTrade marks\u2014Infringement\u2014Injunction\u2014YO-YO and BO-LO\u2014Registered user agreement\u2014Breach of agreement\u2014Whether permitted user can infringe\u2014Whether trade marks have become generic\u2014Trade Marks Act, 1952-53 (Can.), c. 49, ss. 2(f), 4, 18, 20, 49.\nThe defendant company was incorporated in 1938 by the plaintiff. In 1955, the company assigned all but one of its trade marks to the plaintiff. Later in the same year, the plaintiff sold control of the company to one K and at the same time granted to the company a non-exclusive licence to use the trade marks. Subsequently, the company and the plaintiff applied for registration of the company as a registered user. This application was granted but subject to the condition that the company could use the trade marks only so long as the plaintiff was given free access to the premises of the company to inspect the finished wares. There was no mention of the right of inspection in the documents under which the control of the company had been sold and the trade marks assigned. The remaining trade mark Bo-Lo was subsequently dealt with in a similar manner and subject to the same conditions.\nIn December 1962, the plaintiff demanded the right to inspect and this was refused. He then wrote a letter to the company purporting to terminate the registered user agreement. This was followed by a demand from his solicitor that the company refrain from further use of the trade marks. Proceedings with the registrar were than commenced to cancel the company's registered user licence under s. 49(10) (a) of the Trade Marks Act. This application was still pending when the plaintiff brought the present action claiming damages for infringement and an injunction restraining the defendant company from further infringement. The Exchequer Court maintained the action for infringement and rejected the counter-claim of the defendant for the expungement of certain trade marks. In this Court the defendant limited its appeal to two trade marks Yo-Yo and Bo-Lo. The plaintiff cross-appealed in respect of trade marks containing the word \"Cheerio\" which the trial judge held to be invalid.\nHeld (Judson J. dissenting): The appeal and the cross-appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Martland, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ.: There were no reasons to disturb the finding of the trial judge, supported by the evidence, that the defendant had breached its registered user agreement by refusing access to the plaintiff.\nAll the documents must be considered as part of the agreement between the parties and, therefore, the limitation on the registered user contained in the application to the registrar was a limitation enforceable on the demand of the plaintiff. The words \"in accordance with the terms of his registration as such\" in s. 49(2) of the Act applied directly to the limitation in the application for registration as the registered user, and this application was part of the agreement between the parties. Between the immediate parties this was simply a matter of contract and, once the application for a registered user was found to be part of the contract, then that application as a contract could be enforced as any other contract, and the plaintiff could take steps to cancel it for breach of its provisions. As between the defendant and the plaintiff the right to use the trade marks was governed by the condition of the licence and when the defendant breached the registered user agreement it forfeited whatever rights it had to use the trade marks and became an infringer, if the trade marks were valid. No rights subsisted under the agreement transferring control of the company, because that agreement and the joint application to the registrar were indivisible as part and parcel of the transaction.\nThe argument that the trade marks were invalid because the words Yo-Yo and Bo-Lo were generic terms which could not be appropriated as a trade mark, could not be upheld. Since it was the plaintiff's whole case that the licence to use the trade marks had been cancelled by his solicitor's letter, the plaintiff could not invoke estoppel against the defendant on the basis of the licence after the licence had been terminated. However, the defendant company, having assigned the trade marks to the plaintiff, could not derogate from its own grants and was, therefore estopped as between itself and the plaintiff from disputing the validity of the trade marks.\nAs a result of the \"Cheerio\" marks having been assigned to the plaintiff and having been the subject of the licence back from the plaintiff to the defendant, it appeared that whatever the word \"Cheerio\" appeared to designate or distinguish, it certainly did not distinguish the wares of the plaintiff from those of others and, consequently not being distinctive, was invalid. The Court would not be justified in writing into the contract of assignment any covenant that the defendant should change its corporate name. That covenant having been omitted, then the result that the word \"Cheerio\" was invalid was inevitable.\nPer Judson J., dissenting: The trial judge was in error in holding that the company was no longer a permitted user of the trade marks. According to s. 49(10) of the Act, the registration can be cancelled only by the registrar or by the Exchequer Court. There is no provision for its cancellation merely by a notice from one party to the other. If the application for the registered user is regarded as an agreement then the mere cancellation of such agreement would have to be followed by a cancellation of the registration. The rights specified in s. 49(2) and (3) of the Act flow from the registration and continue as long as the registration subsists. There can be no infringement as long as the registration subsists.\nThe trial judge was in error in not expunging the mark Yo-Yo. The evidence strongly supports the submission that the word Yo-Yo at the present time means the article itself. No buyer at the present day could possibly associate that word with the goods of a particular trader or think it distinguishes the goods of one person from another. The Act makes it clear that the appropriate time of examination and the propriety of a trade mark position on the register under s. 18(1) (b) is the time of the proceedings. This is a straight question of fact and it matters not how the lack of distinctiveness is brought about. Any other result would give the proprietor of a so-called trade mark a perpetual monopoly over the sale of the article even when the mark is in no way distinctive of the wares of the owner.\nMarques de commerce\u2014Usurpation\u2014Injonction\u2014YO-YO et BO-LO\u2014Usager inscrit\u2014Violation de l'entente\u2014Un usager inscrit peut-il \u00eatre coupable d'usurpation\u2014Les marques de commerce sont-elles devenues g\u00e9n\u00e9riques\u2014Loi sur les Marques de Commerce, 1952-53 (Can.), c. 49, arts. 2(f), 4, 18, 20, 49.\nEn 1938, la compagnie d\u00e9fenderesse fut incorpor\u00e9e par le demandeur. En 1955, la compagnie a transf\u00e9r\u00e9 au demandeur toutes ses marques de commerce \u00e0 l'exception d'une. Plus tard dans la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e, le demandeur a vendu le contr\u00f4le de la compagnie \u00e0 un nomm\u00e9 K et en m\u00eame temps a accord\u00e9 \u00e0 la compagnie une licence non exclusive pour se servir des marques de commerce. Subs\u00e9quemment, la compagnie et le demandeur se port\u00e8rent demandeurs en vue de l'inscription de la compagnie comme usager inscrit. Cette demande fut accord\u00e9e mais sujette \u00e0 la condition que la compagnie pourrait se servir des marques de commerce seulement en autant que le demandeur aurait libre entr\u00e9e sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la compagnie pour inspecter les marchandises finies. Les documents, en vertu desquels le contr\u00f4le de la compagnie avait \u00e9t\u00e9 vendu et les marques de commerce transf\u00e9r\u00e9es, ne faisaient pas mention de ce droit d'inspection. L'autre marque de commerce Bo-Lo a \u00e9t\u00e9 le sujet du m\u00eame traitement et des m\u00eames conditions.\nEn d\u00e9cembre 1962, le droit d'inspection a \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9 au demandeur. Il a alors \u00e9crit une lettre \u00e0 la compagnie dans le but de mettre fin \u00e0 l'entente cr\u00e9ant l'usage inscrit. Cette lettre a \u00e9t\u00e9 suivie d'une demande par les avocats du demandeur que la compagnie s'abstienne de tout usage des marques de commerce. Des proc\u00e9dures devant le registraire furent institu\u00e9es pour annuler la licence de la compagnie en vertu de l'art. 49(10) (a) de la Loi sur les Marques de Commerce. Cette demande n'avait pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 dispos\u00e9e lorsque le demandeur a institu\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sente action pour r\u00e9clamer des dommages pour usurpation et une injonction pour mettre fin \u00e0 toute usurpation additionnelle de la compagnie. La Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier a maintenu l'action pour usurpation et a rejet\u00e9 la demande reconventionnelle de la d\u00e9fenderesse pour faire radier certaines marques de commerce. Devant cette Cour la d\u00e9fenderesse a limit\u00e9 son appel \u00e0 deux marques de commerce\u2014Yo-Yo et Bo-Lo. Le demandeur a port\u00e9 contre-appel en regard des marques de commerce contenant le mot \u00ab Cheerio \u00bb que le juge au proc\u00e8s avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9es invalides.\nArr\u00eat: L'appel et le contre-appel doivent \u00eatre rejet\u00e9s, le Juge Judson \u00e9tant dissident.\nLes Juges Martland, Ritchie, Hall et Spence: Il n'y avait aucun motif pour changer le verdict du juge au proc\u00e8s, support\u00e9 par la preuve, que la compagnie avait viol\u00e9 son entente d'usager inscrit en refusant l'entr\u00e9e au demandeur.\nTous les documents doivent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme faisant partie de l'entente entre les parties et, en cons\u00e9quence, les restrictions impos\u00e9es \u00e0 l'usager inscrit contenues dans la demande au registraire \u00e9taient des restrictions ex\u00e9cutoires \u00e0 la demande du demandeur. Les mots \u00ab selon les termes de son enregistrement \u00e0 ce titre \u00bb dans l'art. 49(2) de la Loi s'appliquent directement \u00e0 la restriction dans la demande en vue de l'inscription comme usager inscrit, et cette demande faisait partie de l'entente entre les parties. Entre les parties imm\u00e9diates, ceci \u00e9tait simplement une question de contrat et, une fois que la demande pour l'inscription d'un usager inscrit se trouvait \u00e0 faire partie du contrat, la demande comme contrat pouvait \u00eatre mise en vigueur comme tout autre contrat, et le demandeur pouvait prendre les moyens de la faire annuler pour violation de ses dispositions. Entre la d\u00e9fenderesse et le demandeur, le droit de se servir des marques de commerce \u00e9tait gouvern\u00e9 par la condition dans la licence, et lorsque la d\u00e9fenderesse a viol\u00e9 l'entente par laquelle elle \u00e9tait devenue usager inscrit, elle a perdu tous les droits qu'elle pouvait avoir de se servir des marques de commerce et est devenue une usurpatrice, si les marques de commerce \u00e9taient valides. Il ne subsistait aucun droit en vertu de l'entente transf\u00e9rant le contr\u00f4le de la compagnie, parce que cette entente et la demande conjointe au registraire \u00e9taient indivisibles comme faisant partie int\u00e9grante de la transaction.\nLa proposition que les marques de commerce \u00e9taient invalides parce que les mots Yo-Yo et Bo-Lo \u00e9taient des termes g\u00e9n\u00e9riques qui ne pouvaient pas \u00eatre employ\u00e9s comme marque de commerce n'\u00e9tait pas soutenable. Puisque toute la cause du demandeur reposait sur le fait que la licence pour se servir des marques de commerce avait \u00e9t\u00e9 annul\u00e9e par la lettre de l'avocat, le demandeur ne pouvait pas opposer une fin de non-recevoir \u00e0 la d\u00e9fenderesse sur la base de la licence apr\u00e8s que la licence avait \u00e9t\u00e9 termin\u00e9e. Cependant, la compagnie d\u00e9fenderesse, ayant transf\u00e9r\u00e9 les marques de commerce au demandeur, ne pouvait pas porter atteinte \u00e0 sa propre cession et \u00e9tait alors emp\u00each\u00e9e de mettre en dispute entre elle et le demandeur la validit\u00e9 des marques de commerce.\nComme r\u00e9sultat du fait que les marques \u00ab Cheerio \u00bb avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9es au demandeur et avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 le sujet d'une licence du demandeur \u00e0 la d\u00e9fenderesse, il semble que quoi que ce soit que le mot \u00ab Cheerio \u00bb semble d\u00e9signer ou distinguer, il ne distingue certainement pas les marchandises du demandeur de celles des autres et, cons\u00e9quemment, n'\u00e9tant pas distinctif, \u00e9tait invalide. La Cour ne serait pas justifi\u00e9e d'\u00e9crire dans le contrat transf\u00e9rant les marques une clause \u00e0 l'effet que la d\u00e9fenderesse devrait changer son nom de corporation. Cette clause ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 omise, le r\u00e9sultat \u00e9tait in\u00e9vitable que le mot \u00ab Cheerio \u00bb \u00e9tait invalide.\nLe Juge Judson, dissident: Le juge au proc\u00e8s a err\u00e9 en adjugeant que la d\u00e9fenderesse n'\u00e9tait plus un usager inscrit des marques de commerce. Selon l'art. 49(10) de la Loi, l'enregistrement comme usager inscrit ne peut \u00eatre annul\u00e9 que seulement par le registraire ou par la Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier. Il n'y a aucune disposition pour l'annuler simplement par un avis d'une des parties \u00e0 l'autre. Si la demande pour inscrire comme usager inscrit est consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme un contrat, alors la seule annulation de ce contrat doit \u00eatre suivie d'une annulation de l'enregistrement. Les droits sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9s dans l'art. 49(2) et (3) de la Loi d\u00e9coulent de l'enregistrement et continuent aussi longtemps que l'enregistrement subsiste. Il ne peut y avoir aucune usurpation aussi longtemps que l'enregistrement subsiste.\nLe juge au proc\u00e8s a err\u00e9 en ne radiant pas la marque Yo-Yo. La preuve supporte fortement l'argument que le mot Yo-Yo signifie pr\u00e9sentement l'article lui-m\u00eame. Aucun acheteur aujourd'hui ne pourrait possiblement associer ce mot avec les marchandises d'un marchand particulier ou penser qu'il est distinctif des marchandises d'une personne. La Loi est claire que le moment opportun pour faire cet examen en vertu de l'art. 18(1) (b) est l'\u00e9poque o\u00f9 sont entam\u00e9es les proc\u00e9dures. Ceci est une simple question de fait et il n'importe pas de savoir comment ce manque de caract\u00e8re distinctif a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9. Tout autre r\u00e9sultat donnerait au propri\u00e9taire de la marque de commerce un monopole perp\u00e9tuel sur la vente de l'article m\u00eame lorsque la marque n'est d'aucune fa\u00e7on distinctive de la marchandise du propri\u00e9taire.\nAPPEL et CONTRE-APPEL d'un jugement du Juge No\u00ebl de la Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier de Canada[1]. Appel et contre-appel rejet\u00e9s, le Juge Judson \u00e9tant dissident.\nAPPEAL and CROSS-APPEAL from a judgment of No\u00ebl J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada[2]. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed, Judson J. dissenting.\nGordon F. Henderson, Q.C., and David Watson, for the defendant, appellant. Donald F. Sim, Q.C., and W. F. Green, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of Martland, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nHALL J.:\u2014The respondent brought action against the appellant alleging infringement of certain trade marks registered in his name with the Registrar of Trade Marks for Canada. Some 23 trade marks were involved and dealt with by No\u00ebl J. in the Exchequer Court[3], but in this Court the appellant limited the appeal to two trade marks\u2014Yo-Yo and Bo-Lo. The respondent has cross-appealed in respect of trade marks containing the word \"Cheerio\" which No\u00ebl J. held to be invalid, but in this Court abandoned his claim to the trade mark \"Beginners\".\nThe history of the transactions leading to the litigation is shortly as follows. The appellant company was incorporated by the respondent Dubiner on July 6, 1938. He continued to operate the company until August 17, 1955, when by an agreement in writing one A. Krangle acquired 75 per cent of the issued shares in the company and all the issued shares in another company called Dulev Plastics Ltd. from Dubiner and Dubiner's wife Betty. One A. C. Gallo was the owner of the remaining 25 per cent of the shares in the appellant company. He continued as owner of these shares.\nHowever, prior to this transaction, the appellant company had, on March 15, 1955, assigned to Dubiner all the trade marks in issue in this action excepting Bo-Lo, (Exhibit 7). Bo-Lo was subsequently assigned to Dubiner on April 11, 1957, (Exhibit 8). Both assignments were identical in language except that the assignment of March 15, 1955, covered a number of trade marks whereas that of April 11, 1957, covered Bo-lo only. The grant clause in each assignment reads as follows:\nFOR VALUABLE CONSIDERATION hereby acknowledged to have been received by it, CHEERIO TOYS & GAMES LIMITED, of the City of Toronto, and Province of Ontario, the Transferor, has agreed to transfer and doth hereby transfer to SAMUEL DUBINER of P.O.B. 35, Bnei Beraq, Israel, all of its right, title and interest in and to the Trade Marks hereinafter set forth and registered in the Trade Marks Office of Canada in the name of the Transferor as follows, namely:\nThe agreement of August 17, 1955, contained clauses reading: 8. Samuel Dubiner doth hereby grant to Cheerio a non-exclusive licence to use the trade marks, patents, industrial designs and copy rights hereinbefore referred to.\n9. In consideration of the granting of the aforesaid non-exclusive licence and Samuel Dubiner's agreement to reveal to Cheerio the systems of marketing and his knowledge in connection therewith from time to time as requested by Cheerio, and his agreement to assist Cheerio from time to time from Israel, Cheerio doth hereby covenant and agree to pay to Dubiner in each year a sum equal to five per centum (5%) of the sales price (excluding sales tax) of all bandalore tops sold by Cheerio in such year, and Cheerio doth further covenant and agree to pay to Samuel Dubiner's mother the sum of $12.00 per week in each and every week so long as she lives.\nOn August 31, 1955, Dubiner and the appellant company applied to the Registrar of Trade Marks to register the company as a registered user of the relevant trade marks (other than Bo-Lo) under s. 49 of the Trade Marks Act, c. 49, 1-2 Eliz. II, which reads in part:\n49. (1) A person other than the owner of a registered trade mark may be registered as a registered user thereof for all or any of the wares or services for which it is registered.\n(2) The use of a registered trade mark by a registered user thereof in accordance with the terms of his registration as such in association with wares or services manufactured, sold, leased, hired or performed by him, or the use of a proposed trade mark as provided in subsection (2) of section 39 by a person approved as a registered user thereof, is in this section referred to as the \"permitted use\" of the trade mark.\nOn March 9, 1956, the Registrar notified Mr. Leon Arthurs, a patent and trade mark attorney who was acting for both parties in submitting the application of August 31, 1955, that the appellant company had been registered as a registered user in the form following:\nSeptember 14, 1955\u2014CHEERIO TOYS & GAMES LIMITED, 35 Hanna Avenue, Toronto, Ontario is hereby registered as a Registered User of the trade mark registered under No., in respect of the wares in association with which the trade mark is now registered. The Registered User is the former owner of the trade mark. The Registered User is to use the trade mark only in association with wares meeting the standards of quality and efficiency established by it while it was the owner of the trade mark, and only so long as the Registered Owner is given free access to the premises of the Registered User to inspect the finished wares and finds them in compliance with the aforesaid standards. The permitted use is without definite period.\n(The italics are mine.)\nThe trade mark Bo-Lo was subsequently dealt with in a similar manner and subject to the same conditions on May 28, 1957. Henceforth, no distinction need be made in regard to Bo-Lo. The appellant company continued to operate as a \"registered user\" of the relevant trade marks. Gallo, who owned 25 per cent of the issued shares in the appellant company, had been associated with the respondent from the time the company was incorporated in 1938. When Krangle acquired control in 1955 under the agreement of August 17, 1955, Gallo joined the company as an employee and as a watchdog for the respondent. Difficulties arose between Krangle and Gallo which eventually resulted in Gallo being dismissed in June of 1962.\nThroughout the period 1955 to 1962, the respondent was living in Israel. He came to Canada in December 1962 to try to settle the differences between Krangle and Gallo. The parties met on several occasions, the last meeting being on December 28,1962.\nThe learned trial judge summarized the events of December 27, and the final meeting on December 28, 1962, as follows:\nA number of meetings had already been held between them when on December 27, 1962, a meeting was arranged by the plaintiff and Krangle over the telephone for the next day in Krangle's office located in the premises of the defendant company at 11 Church Street, Toronto. During this conversation, Gallo entered Dubiner's room and the latter interrupted his phone call to ask Gallo the time of their appointment at the television station the next morning, for the purpose of looking at a film which Krangle erroneously took to be one produced for the purpose of selling yo-yos and Bo-Los but which, in fact, had nothing to do with the company's business at all as it dealt with Israeli art. This matter is mentioned merely because the meeting which took place the next day, at the defendant's premises at 11 Church Street, Toronto, would have started off on this misunderstanding with an accusation by Krangle that both Dubiner and Gallo were planning to have a television film made dealing with yo-yo return tops in competition with his business, which, however, Dubiner hastened to deny and explain. Although Krangle claims that the matter of the film script came up at the end of the meeting only, there is no question that the discussions which took place at this meeting were carried out in an atmosphere of tension and anger largely as a result of the television scripts but also because of Gallo's claims and lasted an hour, dealing chiefly with the latter's demand for salary and a share in profits from the year 1956 on which the parties could, however, not agree on and it was at this stage when it appeared that nothing more could be said that the plaintiff, as he was walking towards the door, turned to Krangle and said: \"Well Albert, now I want to go into your stock room and examine the quality of your merchandise,\" to which Krangle replied \"Sam, I won't let you in the back, I understand you have been at the T.V. Station and you have never inspected my wares before. I think there is more to this and you had better see my lawyer.\"\nKrangle did nothing further and on January 8, 1963, the respondent sent the appellant a letter as follows: By the terms of the registered user agreement between myself and Cheerio Toys and Games Limited, dated Toronto, the 31st day of August, 1955, Cheerio Toys and Games Limited is required to give me full access to the premises of the registered user, to inspect the finished wares, to ascertain that the quality standard set by me are maintained.\nOn Friday December 28th, 1962 I was denied access to these facilities by you. This is to advise you that without prejudice to all other rights and causes of action which I may have against you, I do hereby terminate the registered user agreement as of December 28th, 1962.\nThis letter was not answered nor did Krangle get in touch with the respondent.\nOn January 14, 1963, the respondent had his solicitors write the appellant company as follows:\nCheerio Toys & Games Limited,\n11 Church Street,\nToronto, Ontario.\nAttention: A. Krangle, Esq.\nDear Sirs:\nWe act for Samuel Dubiner, the owner of certain trade marks under which you have, prior to December 28th, 1962, been operating as a registered user.\nThis registered user agreement has been terminated by Mr. Dubiner and we now request without prejudice to the other rights which Mr. Dubiner may have against you, your written undertaking to refrain from further use of any of the marks in question in respect of the wares for which they are registered and your undertaking to deliver existing stock bearing the trade marks to Mr. Dubiner or your written assurance that the trade marks will be removed from such stock.\nIf this undertaking is not received by January 21st, 1963, we shall take the necessary steps to protect our client's position without further notice to you.\nYours very truly,\nMcCarthy & McCarthy,\nper Donald F. Sim.\nOn the same day, the respondent's solicitors instituted proceedings with the Registrar under s. 49(10) of the Act to cancel the appellant's registered user licence. This proceeding was still pending when, on March 13, 1963, the respondent, not having received the undertaking asked for in the solicitors' letter of January 14, brought this action claiming damages for infringement and an injunction restraining the appellant company from further infringement.\nThe learned trial judge found as follows regarding the events of December 27 and 28, 1962:\nNow, the evidence regarding what took place at the premises of the defendant on December 28, 1962, is somewhat contradictory, Krangle contending that he did not refuse access but merely referred the plaintiff to his lawyer as he thought that there was more to the situation than a mere wish to inspect the defendant's wares for quality, that Dubiner had never inspected the wares before, and that if he had really wanted to inspect he could have done so on the above date in his office where the discussions took place and where stock comprising several samples of each item of merchandise was kept up to date.\nThis, however, is not entirely true as it appears from the evidence that Dubiner had carried out some sort of inspection of wares of the defendant on each of his visits to Toronto and in one case, according to a witness produced by the defendant, became quite mad with Krangle because he was not satisfied with the quality of some of the tops. Furthermore, the latter did refuse to allow Dubiner to go into the back of the premises on the relevant date and, therefore, in my opinion, did not give him free access as he was obliged to under his registered user agreement and registration. As for the display of wares in Krangle's office, some of the wares were missing and, at any event, a proper and satisfactory spot check could not be made by Dubiner from such a selection, the latter being entitled to free access for inspection which, in my opinion, could not be restricted to one area only of the defendant's premises.\nFurthermore, although the letters sent by Dubiner and his solicitors, as we have seen, closed the door to any possibility of allowing Krangle to comply with the obligation to give free access, there is no evidence that the latter, through his lawyer or personally attempted in any manner after December 28, 1962, to comply with same and I, therefore, must of necessity find that the defendant has breached its registered user agreement.\nThese findings are fully supported by the evidence and I see no reason to disturb them.\nThe appellant company had based its defence and counterclaim on numerous grounds but in this Court relied on three grounds only, as follows:\n(1) The appellant was a permitted user under the Trade Marks Act by entry on the Register and therefore could not infringe.\n(2) The appellant was licensed and therefore did not infringe. (3) Yo-Yo and Bo-Lo were generic terms which cannot be appropriated as a trade mark and therefore the trade marks were invalid.\nIt was Mr. Henderson's submission that the Trade Marks Act of 1953, for the first time in Canada permitted an assignment of the right to use a trade mark without the assignment of the goodwill, i.e., the separation of the identity of the user of the mark from the ownership thereof. It was the appellant's argument, however, that this statutory provision did not change the basic law of contract in any way and that the contract, in this case the agreement of August 17, 1955, remained fully in effect independently of the registration of the \"registered user\" agreement. It should be noted that the condition upon which the respondent relied was contained in the so-called \"registered user\" agreement and not in the so-called \"main agreement\" of August 17, 1955.\nNo\u00ebl J. found:\nThe assignment of the trade marks from Cheerio Toys and Games Limited to Dubiner and the user rights back to the defendant company must, I believe, all be read together and if this is done, it appears that as a result of the above transactions there has subsisted rights in two persons to the use of confusing trade marks and the evidence disclosing that those rights have been concurrently exercised by such persons the trade mark CHEERIO would have, therefore, become non-distinctive within the meaning of s. 47(2) of the Trade Marks Act which reads as follows:\nThis portion refers particularly to the Cheerio marks but the finding that the whole was one transaction is equally applicable to the Yo-Yo and Bo-Lo marks. I am also of opinion that that finding is in accordance with the evidence.\nDubiner swore that to the best of his memory all documents were executed at the same time. Moreover, the respondent pleaded in para. (4) of the Statement of Claim:\nOn or about the 31st of August 1955, the Plaintiff and the Defendant entered into an agreement being an application for registration of the Defendant as a registered user of the trade marks identified \u2026The said agreement provided, inter alia, as follows: (The limitations are then recited).\nAnd in the Statement of Defence, the appellant in para. (4) admitted the allegations contained in para. (4) of the Statement of Claim. I am, therefore, in agreement with the learned Exchequer Court judge when he found that all the documents must be considered as part of the agreement between the parties and that, therefore, the limitation on the registered user contained in the application to the Registrar was a limitation enforceable on the demand of the respondent.\nThe appellant submits that it is the registered user so named and it could not be an infringer as long as it remained on the register of Trade Marks. Section 20 of the Trade Marks Act provides that the right of the owner of a registered trade mark to its exclusive use shall be deemed to be infringed by a person not entitled to its use under the Act who sells, distributes or advertises wares or services under the mark.\nSection 49(2) of the statute provides that the use of a registered trade mark by a registered user thereof in accordance with the terms of his registration as such (the italics are mine) is \"the permitted use\" of the trade mark under this section. The appellant attempted to limit the words \"in accordance with the terms of the registered use\" to that referred to in s. 4(1), (2) and (3), but No\u00ebl J. held that the words applied directly to the limitation in the application for registration as the registered user, and that this application was part of the agreement between the parties. And I can see no other result possible.\nIt must be remembered that Mr. Arthurs, in his letter to the Registrar in which he forwarded the application for a registered user, said:\nIn answer to your request for a copy of the agreement between the parties, please be advised that the entire agreement is constituted by the registered user application which was filed.\nAs I have said, Mr. Arthurs acted for both parties on the application.\nThe appellant argued very strenuously that the only method by which a registered user could be terminated was by proceeding under s. 49(10) of the statute, and that until it had been so terminated the registered user could not be an infringer. And further, that by subs. (12) the Registrar upon considering such an application was required to give every person affected a notice and therefore that had such an application been taken by the respondent Dubiner then the appellant company would have been notified and had an opportunity to make such representations as it deemed fit to the Registrar and would only have been an infringer if such representations had failed to convince the Registrar and he had cancelled the registered user. That might well be so between either of those litigants and a third party, i.e., an application by the AB company to cancel the registered user on the ground that it was contra public interest, etc. But between the immediate parties this is simply a matter of contract and once the application for a registered user is found to be part of the contract then that application as a contract may be enforced as any other contract and the respondent Dubiner may take steps to cancel it for breach of its provisions. It was not strenuously argued before us that there was no reasonable notice, and, in fact, the appellant company could have put the respondent in a very awkward position simply by notifying him on December 29, or even possibly on January 8, 1963, that he was free to make such inspection as he desired.\nThe appellant argued that since at the time the action was commenced it was a \"registered user\" on the registry of Trade Marks, it could not be an infringer while it remained on the register as a \"registered user\", and relied on s. 49(3) of the Act, which reads:\n(3) The permitted use of a trade mark has the same effect for all purposes of this Act as a use thereof by the registered owner.\nbut this overlooks that the permitted use under this section is use in accordance with the terms of the registration.\nIt argued further that until it had actually been struck from the register as a \"registered user\" in accordance with s. 49(10), it continued to be a \"registered user\" and as such could not be an infringer.\nWhatever validity that argument might have as between a \"registered user\" and a third party, and I express no opinion on the point, I am of opinion that as between the appellant and the respondent the right to use the trade marks Yo-Yo and Bo-Lo was governed by the condition of the licence quoted above, and when, as found by the learned trial judge, that the appellant breached the \"registered user\" agreement by refusing the respondent \"free access to the premises of the registered user to inspect the finished wares \u2026.\" it forfeited whatever rights it had to use the said trade marks and after receipt of the solicitor's letter of January 14, 1963, had no right to persist in using these trade marks and it was in consequence an infringer, if in fact the trade marks were valid.\nNo rights subsisted under the so-called \"main agreement\" of August 17, 1955, because that agreement and the joint application to the Registrar to register the appellant as a \"registered user\" were indivisible as part and parcel of one transaction, and I agree with No\u00ebl J.'s finding in this respect.\nI therefore, turn to the appellant's third proposition, i.e., that Yo-Yo and Bo-Lo are generic terms which cannot be appropriated as a trade mark and the trade marks are, therefore, invalid.\nSection 18(1) of the Trade Marks Act provides:\n18. (1) The registration of a trade mark is invalid if\n(a) the trade mark was not registrable at the date of registration;\n(b) the trade mark is not distinctive at the time proceedings bringing the validity of the registration into question are commenced; or\n(c) the trade mark has been abandoned;\nand subject to section 17, it is invalid if the applicant for registration was not the person entitled to secure the registration.\nThe appellant in its pleadings pleads in para. 20:\nThe defendant alleges and the fact is that the word Yo-Yo is used in Canada as and is the generic name used to describe and identify a particular type of top and as such does not indicate the wares of any particular person.\nIt repeats the same allegation as to the word Bo-Lo in para. 21.\nEvidence was not adduced as to the registrability of the trade marks at the date of registration in reference to s. 18(1) (a) and the argument before the Exchequer Court judge and in this Court was restricted as to whether the trade marks were or were not distinctive at the time proceedings bringing their validity into question were commenced, i.e., at the commencement of this action on March 13, 1963.\nDuring the argument, the point was raised that the submission that the trade marks were invalid could not be made by the registered user thereof as he held a licence from the owner of the trade marks and to deny the validity of the trade marks would be to deny his licence. However, since it was the respondent's whole case that the licence to use the trade marks had been cancelled by the letter of December 28, 1962, the respondent cannot invoke estoppel against the appellant on the basis of the licence after the licence had been terminated. The law in this regard was clearly stated by Eve J. in Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal Navigation v. Bradley[4], when he said at p. 105:\nI think the answer to that is that, although the licensee cannot be heard to dispute the title of the licensor, so long as the relationship of licensee and licensor continues, there is no continuing disability affecting the licensee when the relationship has determined, and from that time he is as competent to assert his rights as any one else.\nThe respondent also took the position that the appellant company, having assigned the trade mark Yo-Yo to the respondent by the agreement of March 15, 1955, and similarly having assigned the trade mark Bo-Lo to the respondent by the agreement of April 11, 1957, could not in this action assert that the trade marks or either of them were invalid. This position, in my opinion, was well taken. The appellant company, having assigned the trade marks to Dubiner, cannot derogate from its own grants and is, therefore, estopped as between itself and Dubiner from disputing the validity of the trade marks; Walton v. Lavater[5], and the judgment of Kekewich J. in Franklin Hocking and Co. Ltd. v. Franklin Hocking[6].\nMuch reliance was placed upon the decision in the United States Circuit Court of Appeals in Donald F. Duncan Inc. v. Royal Tops Manufacturing Company Inc. et al.[7], decided in March of this year. That case was decided on a mass of factual evidence adduced at the trial substantially different from the facts in evidence here, but a more important distinction is that in that case the parties challenging the validity of the trade mark were not estopped from doing so.\nHaving concluded that the appellant is estopped from disputing the validity of the trade marks assigned by it to the respondent, it is not necessary to go into the question as to whether the trade marks or either of them were distinctive at the date these proceedings were instituted.\nI turn next to the cross-appeal as to the various Cheerio marks.\nCounsel for the respondent and cross-appellant abandoned any claim as to the validity of the trade mark \"Beginners\" and it need not be further considered. The Cheerio marks had been assigned by Cheerio Toys and Games Ltd. to Dubiner and had been the subject of the licence back from Dubiner to the Cheerio Company. The learned Exchequer Court judge held that the separation of the marks from the company by the assignment to Dubiner had resulted in the fact that Dubiner was the owner of the trade marks and yet the company was entitled to carry on under its name \"Cheerio Toys and Games Ltd.\", and said:\nAs a result of this situation it therefore appears that whatever the word CHEERIO now appears to designate or distinguish, it certainly does not distinguish the wares of the plaintiff from those of others and, consequently not being distinctive, is invalid. The same applies to CHEERIO Yo-Yo, CHEERIO DESIGN, CHEERIO BEGINNER, CHEERIO TOURNAMENT and CHEERIO CHAMPION.\nCounsel for the respondent as cross-appellant submitted that it was the duty of the Court to ascertain the true intention of the parties at the time of the transactions and if such true intention was to give to the respondent Dubiner the property in the Cheerio trade marks then it should enforce that intention by declaring the validity of the trade marks despite the fact that the assignor company was not required in the assignment to Dubiner to alter its corporate name as the parties could not have intended to adopt a course which would result in the invalidity of the name. I am of opinion that the Court would not be justified in writing into the contract of assignment from Cheerio to Dubiner of March 1955 any covenant that Cheerio should change its corporate name. That covenant having been omitted, then the result which the learned Exchequer Court judge arrived at was inevitable.\nFor these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal and the cross-appeal.\nThe respondent is entitled to the costs of the appeal and the appellant to the costs of the cross-appeal.\nJUDSON J. (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Exchequer Court[8] which allowed the action of the respondent Samuel Dubiner for infringement of trade marks and rejected the counter-claim of the appellant, Cheerio Toys & Games Limited, for the expungement of certain trade marks.\nIn 1955 the company was the registered owner of all the trade marks involved in this action. It was at that time controlled by Dubiner. In March 1955, the company assigned all the trade marks with one exception to Dubiner, and in April of that year, Dubiner sold control of the company to one A. Krangle and at the same time granted to the company a non-exclusive licence to use the trade marks in consideration of the payment of a royalty of 5 per cent and a small annuity to Dubiner's mother.\nIn August 1955, Dubiner and the company jointly applied for registration of the company as a registered user of the trade marks. After some correspondence between the Registrar and the common agent for the two parties on March 9, 1956, the Registrar informed the agent that the company was recorded as registered user of all the trade marks, except one, involved in this action. The company became the registered user of that trade mark about a year later on the same terms.\nThe terms of the registration are as follows: September 14, 1955\u2014CHEERIO TOYS & GAMES LIMITED, 35 Hanna Avenue, Toronto, Ontario, is hereby registered as a Registered User of the trade mark registered under No. N.S. 35-9570 in respect of the wares in association with which the trade mark is now registered. The Registered User is the former owner of the trade mark. The Registered User is to use the trade mark only in association with wares meeting the standards of quality and efficiency established by it while it was the owner of the trade mark, and only so long as the Registered Owner is given free access to the premises of the Registered User to inspect the finished wares and finds them in compliance with the aforesaid standards. The permitted use is without definite period.\nThe right of inspection appears for the first time in the application for registration. There was no mention of it in the documents under which the shares were sold and the trade marks assigned.\nTrouble developed between Dubiner and Krangle, who had been the controlling shareholder since 1955. On December 28, 1962, after an acrimonious meeting between the two, Dubiner demanded the right to inspect. Krangle refused him this right. On January 8, 1963, Dubiner wrote a letter to the company purporting to terminate the registered user agreement as of December 28, 1962, for the denial of access. This was followed by a demand from Dubiner's solicitors that the company refrain from further use of the trade marks. On February 19, 1963, proceedings were commenced to cancel the appellant's registered user by a letter to the Registrar under s. 49(10) (a) of the Trade Marks Act. This application was still pending before the Registrar of Trade Marks at the time of trial. This action was commenced on March 13,1963.\nOne of the main grounds of appeal was that the learned trial judge was in error in holding that as of December 28, 1962, the company was no longer a permitted user of the trade marks and that any use by the company of such trade marks after this date would constitute an infringement. In my opinion, the company is right in this submission. Section 49(1) permits the company's registration as a registered user. By s. 49(3) this permitted use of the trade marks has the same effect for all purposes of the Act as a use by the registered owner. Section 49(10) provides for the cancellation of the registration of a person as a registered user of a trade mark in three ways:\n(a) by the Registrar on the application in writing of the registered owner or registered user of the trade mark;\n(b) by the Registrar on his own motion in respect of any ware or services for which the trade mark is no longer registered;\n(c) by the Exchequer Court upon the application of any person of which notice is served upon the registered owner and of registered users on any of certain specified grounds.\nDubiner did take proceedings on his own application before the Registrar under s. 49(10) (a). These proceedings, as I have said, were still pending at the time of the trial. The plaintiff framed his action as one for infringement and an injunction against the further use of the trade marks; damage or profits; and an order for the delivery up of the infringing articles. The plaintiff made no attempt to bring his case within s. 49(10) (c) of the Act, which gives the Exchequer Court jurisdiction to cancel.\nAccording to s. 49(10) the registration can be cancelled only by the Registrar or by the Exchequer Court. There is no provision for cancellation of the registration merely by a notice from one party to the other. As long as the registration is in effect, the company's use is as a permitted user under s. 49(2), and under s. 49(3) has the same effect as use by the registered owner. It cannot be an infringement. If the application for the registered user is regarded as an agreement then the mere cancellation of such agreement would have to be followed by a cancellation of the registration before the use by the appellant became anything other than a use by the respondent itself. The rights specified by s. 49(2) and (3) flow from the registration and continue as long as the registration subsists.\nIn a contemporaneous and related case before him (Cheerio Toys and Games Limited v. Samuel Dubiner and Cheerio Yo-Yo and Bo-Lo Company Limited[9] the learned trial judge expressed the same opinion of the effect of s. 49 that I have just expressed. He stated it in these terms:\nIndeed, I had occasion to determine in a case in which judgment was rendered this day under No. A-1190 of the files of this Court that the registered user section being one of exception, its provisions must be strictly adhered to and as a procedure was set down in the above section to obtain cancellation of the registration of a registered user, on the grounds therein mentioned, this procedure is the only one available in such cases.\nI agree with this and I cannot understand why he did not apply this principle in the present case instead of holding that the company ceased to be a permitted user the moment the inspection was denied.\nOn this aspect of the case, I wish to put my judgment on this narrow ground and to leave open the question of the right to cancel for the denial of the inspection. The evidence is that Dubiner sold to Krangle an almost bankrupt business which Krangle brought back to prosperity. The consideration given by Krangle was money for the shares, the royalty on sales and the annuity. In return, the company was to become a permitted user. The right to inspect came in when the application for registration was made by a common agent. This agent, in correspondence with the registrar, represented that the application contained the whole agreement between the parties. This was not true. The right of inspection was of minor importance when one looks at the deal as a whole. The important elements in the consideration were the purchase price of the shares, the royalty and the annuity. That is why I say that I am leaving the question of the right to cancel open and simply saying that there can be no infringement as long as the registration subsists.\nAnother ground for appeal was that the trade marks Yo-Yo and Bo-Lo were invalid and should be expunged. This is founded on the argument that these marks were not distinctive within the definition of s. 2 (f) of the Act and that the registration offended s. 18(1), which reads:\n18. (1) The registration of a trade mark is invalid if\n(a) the trade mark was not registrable at the date of registration;\n(b) the trade mark is not distinctive at the time proceedings bringing the validity of the registration into question are commenced; or (c) the trade mark has been abandoned;\nand subject to section 17, it is invalid if the applicant for registration was not the person entitled to secure the registration.\nI agree with the opinion of the learned trial judge that the submission fails on the mark Bo-Lo but on the mark Yo-Yo I am of the contrary opinion. Counsel made it clear that he was not arguing that Yo-Yo was not registrable at the date of registration. He said that he had no concern with this and that it was sufficient for him to show that the word Yo-Yo at the present time means the article itself. The evidence fully supports this submission. I cannot conceive of any person, whether adult or child, going into a shop to buy this article and asking for a Bandalore top. He asks for a Yo-Yo, and everybody knows what this article is. It may well be that those in the toy trade know that Yo-Yos were associated with and made by the company; that there was a registered trade mark in the name of Dubiner with a licence to the company; and that some steps had been taken, although they never reached the court, to restrain infringements. The dominating fact is that this trade mark was and is used by the public as the name of the article. I think that I know why this is so. It was the name of the article when the toy was first introduced into this country. It has always been the name of the article and this has been so found by the United States Circuit Court of Appeals in Donald F. Duncan Inc. v. Royal Tops Manufacturing Company, Inc. et al.[10], decided in March of this year.\nThe learned trial judge in upholding the trade mark put his reasons on very narrow grounds:\nIt would seem that a trade mark can be lost because it has become to mean the ware itself only when the owner has been careless in its use and has allowed extensive piracy of the mark by others.\nWhat the Court is concerned with under s. 18(1) (b) is the actual state of facts at the time of the commencement of the proceedings. Distinctiveness may have been lost many years ago for reasons and because of usage which cannot now be traced or ascertained. The mere fact that at times the proprietor or permitted user has identified the word \"Yo-Yo\" as a trade mark does not mean that there could not be a loss of distinctiveness, if, in fact, there is a loss of distinctiveness. Careless user or the permission of extensive piracy of the mark by others, two of the factors relied upon by the judge, are merely two possible ways in which distinctiveness may be lost. If the Court concludes that at the time of the proceedings the mark is not distinctive, it is error to hold that this conclusion must be wrong because those two particular causes mentioned by the trial judge are absent. In my opinion, no buyer, at the present day, could possibly associate the word Yo-Yo with the goods of a particular trader or think that Yo-Yo distinguishes the goods of one person from another.\nThe test of whether a word that was originally a trade mark has become publici juris was stated by Mellish L.J. in Ford v. Foster[11]:\nThere is no doubt, I think, that a word which was originally a trade mark, to the exclusive use of which a particular trader, or his successor in trade, may have been entitled, may subsequently become publici juris, as in the case which has been cited as Harvey's Sauce (Lagenby v. White (1871) 41 L.J. Ch. 354 n) \u2026. I think the test must be whether the use of it by other persons is still calculated to deceive the public, whether it may still have the effect of inducing the public to buy goods not made by the original owner of the trade mark as if they were his goods. If the mark has come to be so public and in such universal use that nobody can be deceived by the use of it, and can be induced from the use of it to believe that he is buying the goods of the original trader, it appears to me, however hard to some extent it may appear on the trader, yet practically, as the right to a trade mark is simply a right to prevent the trader from being cheated by other persons' goods being sold as his goods through the fraudulent use of the trade mark, the right to the trade mark must be gone.\nThe effect of the decision of this Court in The Bayer Company, Limited v. The American Druggists' Syndicate, Limited[12], has been legislated away. That case was decided under the old Act and it held that a trade mark properly registered cannot be expunged if it ceases to be used as a trade mark and becomes merely descriptive of the article to which it has been applied. The case held that the authority to expunge \"any entry made without sufficient cause\" means without sufficient cause at the time of registration. The legislation on which this judgment was based was amended by s. 52 of the Unfair Competition Act and this amendment appears under slightly different wording in s. 56 of the present Act. The present Act makes it clear that the appropriate time of examination and the propriety of a trade mark's position on the register under s. 18(1) (b) is the time of the proceedings (See Fox, Canadian Law of Trade Marks, 2nd ed., 463-5). This is a straight question of fact and it matters not how the lack of distinctiveness is brought about.\nThere is a public interest in this matter. There should be no judicial watering-down of s. 18(1) (b). Any other result would give the proprietor of a so-called trade mark a perpetual monopoly over the sale of the article even when the mark is in no way distinctive of the wares of the owner.\nI would allow the appeal and order that the mark Yo-Yo, registered No. 94 N.S. 24465, is invalid and should be expunged. I would dismiss the action for infringement and declare that the appellant is and has been permitted to use the marks in question in this action at all material times. On the mark Cheerio I would dismiss the cross-appeal for the reasons given by the trial judge. The appellant should have its costs in all proceedings in the Exchequer Court and in this Court.\nAppeal and cross appeal dismissed with costs, JUDSON J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Gowling, MacTavish, Osborne & Henderson, Ottawa.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: McCarthy & McCarthy, Toronto.\n[1] [1965] 1 Ex.

In an action brought by the executors of WH and MH under the provisions of The Fatal Accidents Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 138, the trial judge found that the collision occurred solely through the negligence of the defendant A who was driving an automobile owned by the defendant car-rental company. Although there was an appeal from that finding, such appeal was dismissed and the only issue on the appeal to this Court was as to the quantum of general damages awarded to the infant son. These damages were assessed by the trial judge at $94,000 and this figure was reduced by the Court of Appeal to $65,000.\nAt the time of the accident WH and MH were in their early thirties and their son was almost 6 years old. WH was a consulting engineer engaged in progressively prosperous employment and had accumulated an estate computed by the trial judge at $31,556.39.\nHeld (Spence J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Cartwright J.: No error in principle was found in the reasons of either of the Courts below. The task of the trial judge was to view the whole of the relevant evidence as a properly instructed jury would do and to fix the figure, not susceptible of precise arithmetical calculation, which would represent compensation for the amount of actual pecuniary benefit which the son might reasonably have expected to enjoy had his parents not been killed. Once the Court of Appeal had decided that the amount fixed by the trial judge was so high as to require interference its duty was the same as that of the trial judge.\nAs a result of the death of his parents the son inherited in round figures the sum of $35,000. When to this was added the sum of $65,000 awarded by the Court of Appeal, he was entitled to a total fund of $100,000. Considering all the relevant evidence, an award which brought the total received by the son up to $100,000 could not be said to be an inadequate compensation for the loss of the pecuniary benefits which he might reasonably have expected to receive had his parents not been killed.\nPer Martland J.: In the circumstances of this case, this Court should not interfere with the amount of the damages awarded by the Court of Appeal.\nPer Judson J.: This was not a case where this Court should interfere. There was no error in principle in the Court of Appeal when it reduced the general damages so as to constitute reversible error. The Court of Appeal was mindful of the principle that an appellate court does not readily interfere with an assessment of damages made by a trial judge unless it is satisfied that the award is clearly unreasonable and unsupported by the evidence or that it is so excessively high as to be clearly erroneous. They were unanimously of the opinion that this case fell within these principles of review.\nPer Ritchie J.: Notwithstanding the provisions of s. 46 of the Supreme Court Act, this Court was not justified in substituting a figure of its own for that awarded by the Court of Appeal except upon the ground that that Court appeared to have applied some wrong principle of law in assessing the damages or that its award was so inordinately high or so inordinately low as to be wholly erroneous. In the circumstances of this case there was no such ground for interfering with the award made by the Court of Appeal. Per Spence J., dissenting: This Court would not vary damages adjudged by the court of appeal in a province which had varied those assessed by the trial judge \u201cexcept in the most exceptional circumstances\u201d, and the so-called exceptional circumstances were those where this Court was of the opinion that the court of appeal had committed an error in principle. Before a court of appeal could properly intervene, it must be satisfied that the trial judge applied a wrong principle of law or, short of that, that the amount awarded by the trial judge was so inordinately high or so inordinately low as to be a wholly erroneous estimate of the damage.\nIn the present case the proper allowance for damages under The Fatal Accidents Act should have been $82,360. This figure was arrived at by attempting to correct two matters of principle upon which the trial judge seemed to have fallen in error. The calculation of the gross estate which WH might have expected to leave, had he died at a normal time and under normal circumstances, should have been based upon a more realistic estimate of his accumulated savings, and an allowance should have been made for the effect of estate duties, federal and provincial, which it appeared the trial judge failed to allow.\nBy virtue of s. 46 of the Supreme Court Act, this Court may \u201cgive the judgment and award the process or other proceeding that the Court whose decision is appealed against, should have given or awarded\u201d. Accordingly, the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the Court of Appeal varied.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, reducing the amount of damages awarded by Moorhouse J. after a trial without a jury. Appeal dismissed, Spence J. dissenting.\nC.F. MacMillan, Q.C., for the plaintiffs, appellants.\nJ.D. Arnup, Q.C., and S. Sadinsky, for the defendants, respondents.\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014The facts out of which this appeal arises are set out in the reasons of my brother Spence, and I shall endeavour to avoid repetition.\nThe only question is as to the quantum of the general damages awarded to Brian Paul Hossack the infant son of the late William Ross Hossack and Mary Ann Hossack. These damages were assessed by the learned trial judge at $94,000 and this figure was reduced by the Court of Appeal to $65,000.\nAt the conclusion of the trial the learned trial judge gave oral reasons for judgment determining all questions of liability and these are no longer in dispute. He reserved his judgment as to the quantum of damages. His findings relevant to the question now in issue are expressed as follows:\nWilliam Ross Hossack was born on the 9th of August, 1927. Mary Ann Hossack was born on the 21st of November 1929. They were married on the 16th of April 1953. Their son, Brian, was born on the 2nd of November 1955. On the evidence it is unlikely there would have been further issue, although I do not overlook the possibility of adoption.\nMary Ann Hossack was a well-educated woman, and a musician of recognized ability, who, I infer, devoted her time to her home and family. There was no evidence of her recent employment out of her home.\nWilliam Ross Hossack was a man of very high academic standing, and most favourably spoken of by his employer. He was a musician of standing; a man whose writings on professional subjects were purchased by magazines, a man who had acquired his Doctorate in Astro-physics, and at the time of his death was employed by the firm of Stevenson and Kellogg, consulting engineers. It is not disputed that he had a very bright future. Evidence of his earnings and savings was given before me.\nFrom evidence given, I compute his estate at $31,556.39. It includes an item of $6,869.84 benefit to be received from the Charles Ross estate.\nThe estate of his wife Mary Ann Hossack I compute at $6,310, subject to possible reduction in the amount of $2,828.57, the amount of a government annuity.\nI shall read the cases referred to by counsel, and shall take into consideration all these factors required to be so taken into consideration, and will endorse the record as to the amount of damages accordingly.\nThe reasons of Schroeder J.A., who gave the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal, in so far as they deal with the question of damages are set out in the reasons of my brother Spence and I will not repeat them.\nI find myself unable to hold that the learned trial judge proceeded on any wrong principle. It is not possible to say that he did not take into account the fact that whatever estate either of the deceased would have left would be subject to succession duty and estate tax. We do not know what contingencies he considered; he may have considered all those enumerated and suggested in the reasons of Schroeder J.A.\nOn the other hand I can find no error in principle in the reasons of the Court of Appeal. Having reached the conclusion that the award was so high as to require alteration, that Court \u201cupon full consideration\u201d has fixed the figure which it finds to be appropriate. Once again we do not know the details of the calculations by which the amount is arrived at. I can see no objection to the course taken by either of the Courts below. The task of the learned trial judge was to view the whole of the relevant evidence as a properly instructed jury would do and to fix the figure, not susceptible of precise arithmetical calculation, which would represent compensation for the amount of actual pecuniary benefit which the son might reasonably have expected to enjoy had his parents not been killed. Once the Court of Appeal had decided that the amount fixed by the learned trial judge was so high as to require interference its duty was the same as that of the learned trial judge.\nAs a result of the death of his parents the son inherits in round figures the sum of $35,000. When to this is added the sum of $65,000 awarded by the Court of Appeal, he becomes entitled to a total fund of $100,000. The income from such a fund will be amply sufficient to provide him with an excellent education without the need of encroaching upon capital. On a consideration of all the relevant evidence it appears to me that an award which brings the total received by the son up to $100,000 cannot be said to be an inadequate compensation for the loss of the pecuniary benefits which he might reasonably have expected to receive had his parents not been killed.\nIn my opinion, this is a case in which the Court of Appeal was justified in altering the assessment made by the learned trial judge and we ought not to interfere with the amount which that Court has fixed.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014In my opinion, in the circumstances of this case, this Court should not interfere with the amount of the damages awarded by the Court of Appeal. Accordingly I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nJUDSON J.:\u2014The Court of Appeal has reduced an award of damages under The Fatal Accidents Act from $94,000 to $65,000. The action was brought on behalf of Brian Hossack, an infant, who, at the time of the accident, was almost six years old. I say at once that in my opinion this is not a case where this Court should interfere. There was no error in principle in the Court of Appeal when it reduced these general damages so as to constitute reversible error. The Court of Appeal was mindful of the principle that an appellate court does not readily interfere with an assessment of damages made by a trial judge unless it is satisfied that the award is clearly unreasonable and unsupported by the evidence or that it is so excessively high as to be clearly erroneous. They were unanimously of the opinion that this case fell within these principles of review and I agree with their judgment.\nThis appeal raises no new problem in this Court. It was argued on behalf of the appellant that this was not a case which should have been reviewed by the Court of Appeal. It was said that these damages were not so inordinately high as to justify any interference. When the problem of review comes up in this Court, this kind of adjectival condemnation of what the Court of Appeal has done offers little or no guidance and it would be better to abandon its use. I refer particularly to the reasons of Rand J. in Lang et al. v. Pollard et al.[1] at pp. 862-3 on this point. I think the Court of Appeal is justified in interfering when it comes to the conclusion that the award is unreasonable. This is a better guide than the form of words that has been in common use.\nThe fact is that in this Court two rules have been applied depending naturally upon what the Court thinks of the amount of the award. If this Court thinks the award at trial was within reasonable limits, it says that the Court of Appeal should not have interfered. If, on the other hand, this Court thinks that the award at trial was not within reasonable limits and, consequently, reviewable by the Court of Appeal, it says that whether or not it would have made the same variation in amount as the Court of Appeal, there is no ground for interference.\nIn spite of the formula that has been used in attempting to define the limits on the power of review of the Court of Appeal, that Court has, I think, always proceeded on the basis that it would review when convinced of the unreasonable nature of the award. There is more to be gained by looking at what the Court of Appeal and this Court have actually done in the leading cases that have come here and by ignoring the adjectival description of the function. I will take as examples five leading cases in this Court. They are:\n1. Lehnert v. Stein[2];\n2. Lang et al. v. Pollard et al.[3];\n3. Hanes et al. v. Kennedy et al.[4];\n4. Pratt v. Beaman[5];\n5. Ross v. Dunstal.[6]; This is what happened in these cases, taking them in the order in which they are listed above:\nAssessmentat Trial\nAssessment inCourt of Appeal\nResult in thisCourt\n1.\n$ 12,000\n$ 18,000\naffirmed\n2.\n7,000\n15,000\naffirmed\n1,200\n3,000\n3.\n10,000\n5,000\naffirmed\n4.\n7,500\n2,075\naffirmed\n5.\n11,060\n8,560\n10,000\n5,482\naffirmed\nIt is highly desirable that this power of review of reasonably wide scope should exist in the Court of Appeal and that this Court, if it recognizes that the case is one for review, should be slow to interfere. Everyone concerned is aware of the difficulties that surround an assessment of damages and its review in the Court of Appeal, and the volume of litigation in personal injury cases and under The Fatal Accidents Act demonstrates the need for an experienced reviewing tribunal with reasonably wide powers. The Court of Appeal has this experience. They know better than anyone else what an award should be both in the interests of justice to the particular litigants and interest of some principle of uniformity, to the extent that this is attainable. Any further reviewing tribunal should be slow to interfere unless it is convinced that there is error in principle.\nIn this particular case the Court of Appeal thought that the award was too high by approximately one-third. There is no principle of law involved in the formulation of this opinion. The trial judge awarded a round sum of $94,000; the Court of Appeal a round sum of $65,000. There is no suggestion anywhere that the Court of Appeal did not take into account all the items that go to make up \u201creasonable prospect of pecuniary loss\u201d in a case of this kind. They differed from the trial judge in their translation of monetary claims into an award. This is a matter of the weight they give to the claims and the supporting evidence. It is, to me, impossible to assign error when they say that considering the case as a whole they think the award should be $65,000 instead of $94,000. I have no doubt that to some extent they reached this result by discounting the claim for loss of prospective inheritance.\nThe facts were fully before them. Without attempting in detail to go into the circumstances of this family, it may be said that the boy\u2019s prospects and those of the family were bright. The boy was an only child. The father was in progressively prosperous employment. The award takes into account maintenance and education until graduation from the university. The evidence of an actuary predicted that this boy, when his father died forty-five years hence, would come into an estate of half a million dollars. This may look all right according to the actuary\u2019s figures and his assumptions, but I doubt whether any jury would have assessed a prospective inheritance at that figure in these uncertain days. It was a figure that the Court of Appeal had the power to review in arriving at their total award. We do not know in precise figures by how much they discounted this element in the trial judge\u2019s assessment, but that is no justification for a further review here.\nI would affirm their judgment and dismiss the appeal with costs.\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014The circumstances giving rise to this appeal have been fully described in the reasons for judgment of my brother Spence and it is unnecessary for me to repeat them at any length.\nThe only question is as to the adequacy of the award of $65,000 which the Court of Appeal substituted for an award of $94,000 made by the learned trial judge in respect of the damages sustained by Brian Hossack as the result of the death of both his parents who were killed in a motor vehicle accident which was found to have occurred solely through the negligence of the respondent Margaret Florence Athron who at the time was driving an automobile owned by the defendant Hertz Drive Yourself Stations of Ontario Limited.\nThe Court of Appeal found that in making his award of damages the learned trial judge had left out of account the fact that the estimated accumulated savings of the deceased father, if he had lived out his life span, would have passed to his son subject to provincial succession duties and federal estate tax. This was a relevant factor as these taxes would have been substantial. The Court of Appeal was also of opinion that the award of $94,000 was inordinately high. Notwithstanding the provisions of s. 46 of the Supreme Court Act, I do not think that this Court is justified in substituting a figure of its own for that awarded by the Court of Appeal except upon the ground that that Court appears to have applied some wrong principle of law in assessing the damages or that its award is so inordinately high or so inordinately low as to be wholly erroneous.\nIn the circumstances of this case I can see no such ground for interfering with the award made by the Court of Appeal and I would accordingly dismiss this appeal.\nSPENCE J. (dissenting):\u2014These are two appeals against the judgments of the Court of Appeal for Ontario. Both judgments in the Court reduced amounts awarded by the learned trial judge after a trial without a jury.\nThe actions arose as a result of an automobile collision which occurred on Highway 17 near the City of Ottawa, between a vehicle driven by the appellant Marjorie Gorman and one driven by the late Dr. William Hossack in which his wife, the late Mary Ann Hossack, and his infant son, Brian Hossack, were passengers. Dr. Hossack and Mrs. Hossack were killed. Mrs. Gorman and Brian Hossack were injured.\nThe learned trial judge found that the collision occurred solely through the negligence of the defendant Margaret Florence Athron who was driving an automobile owned by the defendant Hertz Drive Yourself Stations of Ontario Ltd. Although there was an appeal from that finding, such appeal was dismissed and the only issue in this appeal is that of the quantum of damages as varied by the Court of Appeal for Ontario.\nAfter trial, the learned trial judge, Moorhouse J., awarded to the plaintiff Marjorie Gorman the sum of $35,000 in general damages which with other damages resulted in judgment in her favour for $42,451.18, and awarded to the appellants in the second action who sued under the provisions of The Fatal Accidents Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 138, as executors of both the late Dr. William Hossack and his wife Mary Ann Hossack, the sum of $94,000 general damages which, with other damages, resulted in judgment in their favour in the sum of $95,632.60.\nWhether this Court is justified in varying the judgment of the Court of Appeal, which in turn had varied the damages awarded by the trial judge, has been dealt with in a considerable number of decisions of this Court and it may be taken that the jurisprudence has been established here. In Pratt v. Beaman[7] Anglin J. said at p. 287:\nThe second ground of appeal is that damages allowed for pain and suffering by the trial judge, $1,500, should not have been reduced as they were on appeal, to $500. While, if we were the first appellate court, we might have been disposed not to interfere with the assessment of these damages by the Superior Court, it is the well established practice of this court not to interfere with an amount allowed for damages, such as these, by the court of last resort in a province. That court is, as a general rule, in a much better position than we can be to determine a proper allowance having regard to local environment. It is, of course, impossible to say that the Court of King\u2019s Bench erred in principle in reducing these damages.\n(The italics are my own.)\nIn Hanes v. Kennedy[8], Kerwin J. said at pp. 387-8:\nWhere general damages fixed by a trial judge sitting without a jury have been reduced by a Court of Appeal under circumstances such as we find here, this Court, as a general rule, will not interfere: Ross v. Dunstall (1921), 62 Can. S.C.R. 393; Pratt v. Beaman, [1930] S.C.R. 284. Mr. Cartwright referred to McHugh v. Union Bank of Canada, [1913] A.C. 299 at 309...No error in principle was made by the Court of Appeal in this case, and the cross-appeal should, therefore, be dismissed, with costs.\n(The italics are my own.)\nAnd again, in Lang et al. v. Pollard et al[9], Kerwin J. said at p. 859:\n\u00bcthe same principle is applicable and that is, particularly in Canada where estimates of damages may differ in various Provinces, that this Court will not, except in very exceptional circumstances, interfere with the amounts fixed by the Court of Appeal where they differ from the damages assessed by the trial judge.\n(The italics are my own.)\nIn Lehnert v. Stein[10], Cartwright J. said at p. 45:\nAs to the quantum of damages, this Court is slow to interfere with the amount fixed by a provincial Appellate Court which has varied the assessment made by a trial judge. It is sufficient on this point to refer to the case of Lang et al. v. Pollard et al., [1957] S.C.R. 858. In the case at bar a perusal of the evidence brings me to the conclusion that the amount fixed by the Court of Appeal is not excessive.\nThe final authority to which I shall refer is Widrig v. Strazer et al.[11], where Hall J., giving the judgment of the Court, said at pp. 388-9:\nThe Court of Appeal reduced the trial judge\u2019s award of $40,000 to $12,000. The right of the Court of Appeal to review a trial judge\u2019s award is governed by well-settled principles as stated by Viscount Simon in Nance v. British Columbia Electric Railway Company Ltd., [1951] A.C. 601 at 613., as follows:\nWhether the assessment of damages be by a judge or a jury, the Appellate Court is not justified in substituting a figure of its own for that awarded below simply because it would have awarded a different figure if it had tried the case at first instance. Even if the tribunal of first instance was a judge sitting alone, then, before the appellate court can properly intervene, it must be satisfied either that the judge, in assessing the damages, applied a wrong principle of law (as by taking into account some irrelevant factor or leaving out of account some relevant one); or, short of this, that the amount awarded is either so inordinately low or so inordinately high that it must be a wholly erroneous estimate of the damage.\nUnless there was error of principle on the part of the Court of Appeal, this Court will not interfere with an amount allowed for damages by the court of last resort in a province. I adopt what Cartwright J., speaking for himself and Taschereau J. (as he then was) said in Lang and Joseph v. Pollard and Murphy, [1957] S.C.R. 858 at 862:\nUnder these circumstances where no error of principle and no misapprehension of any feature of the evidence is indicated I think that the rule which we should follow is that stated by Anglin J., as he then was, giving the unanimous judgment of the Court, in Pratt v. Beaman [1930] S.C.R. 284 at 287: (see supra).\nThis decision was followed in the unanimous judgment of this; Court, delivered by Kerwin J., as he then was, in Hanes et al. v. Kennedy et al., [1941] S.C.R. 384 at 387.\nThe principle appears to me to be equally applicable whether the first appellate court has increased or decreased the general damages awarded at the trial.\nIn my view there were errors of principle on the part of the Court of Appeal in reducing the amount of the damages...\nI have avoided citing the cases in which the court of appeal in the province had varied damages awarded by a. jury. To summarize the jurisprudence established by this Court, this Court will not vary damages adjudged by the court of appeal in a province which had varied those assessed by the trial judge \u201cexcept in the most exceptional circumstances\u201d, and it would further appear that the so-called exceptional circumstances are those where this Court is of the opinion that the court of appeal had committed an error in principle.\nTherefore, I turn to examining the problem of whether the Court of Appeal in the present case did commit any errors in principle. The basis upon which a court of appeal is justified in varying the damages awarded by a trial judge, as the Court of Appeal for Ontario did in these cases, again, in my view, has been authoritatively decided by this Court. In Fagnan v. Ure et al.[12], Locke J. said at p. 385:\nThe findings of the learned trial judge as to the compensation to be awarded to the respondents have been approved by the unanimous judgment of the Appellate Division (1957), 22 W.W.R. 289, 9 D.L.R. (2d) 480.\nThe rule applicable when the matter was before that Court is as it is stated by Greer L.J. in Flint v. Lovall, [1935] KB. 354 at 360, in the following terms:\nIn order to justify reversing the trial judge on the question of the amount of damages it will generally be necessary that this Court should be convinced either that the judge acted upon some wrong principle of law, or that the amount awarded was so extremely high or so very small as to make it, in the judgment of this Court, an entirely erroneous estimate of the damage to which the plaintiff is entitled.\nThat statement was approved by the House of Lords in Davies et al. v. Powell Duffryn Associated Collieries, Limited, [1942] A.C. 601 at 617, [1942] 1 All E.R. 657, and by the Judicial Committee in Nance v. British Columbia Electric Railway Company Limited, [1951] A.C. 601 at 613, [1951] 2 All E.R. 448, [1951] 3 D.L.R. 705, 2 W.W.R. (N.S.) 665, 67 C.R.T.C. 340.\nIn the latter case, Viscount Simon, delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee, said at p. 613:\nIn those circumstances two distinct questions arise:\u2014(1) What principles should be observed by an appellate court in deciding whether it is justified in disturbing the finding of the court of first instance as to the quantum of damages; more particularly when that finding is that of a jury, as in the present case. (2) What principles should govern the assessment of the quantum of damages by the tribunal of first instance itself.\n(1) The principles which apply under this head are not in doubt. Whether the assessment of damages be by a judge or a jury, the appellate court is not justified in substituting a figure of its own for that awarded below simply because it would have awarded a different figure if it had tried the case at first instance. Even if the tribunal of first instance was a judge sitting alone, then, before the appellate court can properly intervene, it must be satisfied either that the judge, in assessing the damages, applied a wrong principle of law (as by taking into account some irrelevant factor or leaving out of account some relevant one); or, short of this, that the amount awarded is either so inordinately low or so inordinately high that it must be a wholly erroneous estimate of the damage (Flint v. Lovell, [1935] 1 K.B. 354, approved by the House of Lords in Davies v. Powell Duffryn Associated Collieries Ld., [1942] A.C. 601). The last named case further shows that when on a proper direction the quantum is ascertained by a jury, the disparity between the figure at which they have arrived and any figure at which they could properly have arrived must, to justify correction by a court of appeal, be even wider than when the figure has been assessed by a judge sitting alone. The figure must be wholly \u201cout of all proportion\u201d (per Lord Wright, Davies v. Powell Duffryn Associated Collieries, Ld., [1942] A.C. 601, 616.) Therefore, it must be determined whether the trial judge in the present case applied a wrong principle of law or, short of that, that the amounts awarded by the trial judge were so inordinately high as to be a wholly erroneous estimate of the damage. Since the trial was before a judge without a jury I do not seek to apply the \u201cout of all proportion\u201d test of Lord Wright in Davies v. Powell Duffryn Associated Collieries Ld., supra.\nTHE GORMAN ACTION\nSchroeder J.A., giving the judgment of the Court of Appeal, said:\nWe have also come to the decision that the learned trial Judge\u2019s assessment of general damages in favour of the Respondent Marjorie Gorman is so excessive that it cannot be upheld. We reject the contention of her counsel that a separate assessment should be made in respect of each individual injury sustained by this Respondent. Viewing her injuries as a whole, we consider that an award of $22,500 for general damages would constitute reasonable compensation under that head. To that extent the appeal should be allowed and the judgment varied by substituting for the award of $35,000 for general damages the sum of $22,500.\nIt would appear, therefore, that the learned justice in appeal may well have considered (1) that the trial judge committed an error in principle in that he, acting upon the submission of counsel for the plaintiff Gorman, separately assessed damages for each injury and then totalled them, and (2) that in any event the award of $35,000 general damages was \u201cso inordinately high as to be a wholly erroneous estimate of the damages\u201d.\nTo deal with the first question, counsel for the plaintiff Gorman at trial appeared before this Court as counsel for her as appellant, and agreed that at trial in argument he had cited separate possible amounts of damages for each of his client\u2019s injuries as being appropriate if each of those injuries had been suffered by different individuals but he denied that he had urged the trial judge to total those individual amounts. Counsel, on the other hand, reported that he had urged the trial judge to take into account that all of the injuries had been suffered by one person and award a lump sum considering those injuries and the well recognized elements of future expenses, pain and suffering up to the trial and prospective pain and suffering thereafter, well-nigh total elimination of his client in the enjoyment of life, and the fact that a lady of 60 years of age would not be able to readjust herself to her infirmities as would a younger person.\nThe learned trial judge delivered reasons at the end of the trial in which he determined the issue of liability and reserved for further consideration the quantum of damages, then some weeks later endorsed the record with the amounts of his assessment. However, on delivering judgment at trial, he said:\nMrs. Gorman was an active woman and has been permanently crippled. She enjoyed driving about in her car, golfing, curling, and playing the piano. She feels that her ability to do these things has been completely taken away from her, and that her piano playing has been very seriously and permanently affected. In short, her enjoyment of life has been materially affected by this accident. I feel that it has.\nSome of the injuries which she received consisted of: Lacerations of the lower lip; bruises of the forehead; deep laceration of both knees into the joint; a comminuted fracture of the left patella; a chip fracture of the left femur near the joint; and her right ankle was almost severed. Swelling of the right hand, and there was a fracture of the metacarpal, near the wrist joint, and there was a fracture of the first left and the fourth metatarsal of the left foot; a fracture of the lower mandible; and numerous bruises and contusions. There were operations under general anaesthesia, and she had a cast from the groin to the foot, of both legs, and her jaws were wired because of the fractures, and she was obliged to take food through a tube. She had long and continuing physiotherapy.\nThe medical evidence is that at some time, the right ankle will require to be locked. It has been advised, but this Plaintiff has postponed that for as long as she thinks that she can. However, she will again have to undergo surgery, and be for some few weeks in the hospital. The evidence is that the arthritic condition will be affected; she has had a large amount of dental work, and has undergone pain and suffering. These are factors, all of which have been mentioned by counsel, and if there are any that I have omitted, I simply have taken those from my notes of the evidence, and they will be considered when I endorse the record as to the amount of damages in her case, Mr. Houston.\nI find nothing in that statement to indicate that the learned trial judge was intending to or did total the individual amounts suggested by counsel in order to arrive at his award. The fact that the amounts suggested by counsel for the individual injuries do total approximately that awarded by the trial judge I regard as a mere coincidence and no conclusive indication that such a formula was used. Moreover, counsel for the respondent in this Court admitted that he was unable to cite any authority that such an \u201cadding machine approach\u201d to the assessment of damages was incorrect in principle. It would certainly be inept but even if it had been used by the trial judge, and I am of the opinion that has not been demonstrated, I cannot say that it would be wrong in principle. I turn next to the consideration of whether the award of $35,000 general damages was \u201cso inordinately high as to be a wholly erroneous estimate of the damages\u201d. I have already cited the learned trial judge\u2019s reference to the injuries. Counsel for the appellant in his factum has listed 16 different injuries of varying severity and importance. It seems certain that the appellant who, prior to the accident, was a lady of 60 years of age, one who drove her car constantly and engaged in active sports such as golf and curling, is now a permanently crippled person with, at any rate, a degree of fixity of both legs and with every indication that arthritis resulting from the injuries has already advanced to a considerable degree. The trial judge, called upon to consider these facts in the light of the elements of damages which I have already cited as having been submitted to him by the counsel for the appellant at trial could, in my view, have arrived at a figure of $35,000 for general damages without the award being such as to earn the description as being \u201cso inordinately high as to be a wholly erroneous estimate of damages\u201d. As Cartwright J. pointed out in Lehnart v. Stein, supra, one might only come to the determination of whether an award is \u201cso inordinately high\u201d by perusal of the evidence and I have summarized my perusal of that evidence in expressing the opinion above.\nTHE HOSSACK ACTION\nSchroeder J.A., giving the judgment of the Court of Appeal, said:\nI propose to deal first with the assessment of damages in the action brought under The Fatal Accidents Act. An Appellate Court does not readily interfere with an assessment of damages made by a trial Judge unless it is satisfied that the damages awarded are clearly unreasonable and unsupported by the evidence or that they are so excessively high as to be clearly erroneous. In our respectful view the award of $94,000.00 is so excessively high as to reflect an attempt to award an amount approaching a perfect compensation. There are numerous contingencies to be taken into account in assessing damages in these cases by reason whereof expectations of pecuniary benefit disappointed by a death caused by the act of a wrongdoer must be adequately discounted. The learned Judge failed, in our respectful opinion, to give full and proper effect to those contingencies. It is perfectly obvious that the actuarial evidence of Mr. Lang, based on the estimated savings of the deceased William Ross Hossack, did not take account of the fact that if the Respondents optimistic estimate of the accumulated savings were well founded, they would reach the hands of the beneficiaries subject to provincial succession duties tax and federal estate tax which would be substantial in an estate of half a million dollars. There are also many contingencies as, e.g., if the wife were to predecease the husband, and he were to remarry, or if the husband were to predecease the wife and she were to remarry, further that the wife might have been compelled to live on the husband\u2019s estate, in which event the question would arise as to how much of the said estate would remain on the wife\u2019s death. These and many other contingencies which need not be denominated exist in this case and must be given due effect.\nWe have had the benefit of very able, comprehensive and helpful arguments of counsel in the course of which the evidence was exhaustively reviewed. Upon full consideration we have attained to the conclusion that a proper award in favour of the infant under the provisions of The Fatal Accidents Act would be $65,000.00. To that extent the appeal should be allowed and the judgment in appeal varied by substituting for the sum of $94,000.00 the sum of $85,000.00.\nIt would appear, therefore, that the learned justice in appeal felt that the Court of Appeal was justified in varying the judgment of the learned trial judge for these reasons: (1) that the damages allowed reflected an attempt to award an amount approaching a perfect compensation, (2) that numerous contingencies to be taken into account in assessing damages in a fatal accidents case had not been taken into account, and (3) that the damages awarded were \u201cso inordinately high as to be a wholly erroneous estimate of damages\u201d.\nOne contingency to which the learned justice in appeal refers was that the actuary\u2019s estimate of the total estate which would have been left by the late Dr. William Ross Hossack had he lived out his life in a normal fashion would only have gone to his son after provincial succession duties and federal estate taxes had been deducted therefrom. A further contingency which the learned justice in appeal felt the trial judge had failed to consider was the possibility of Mrs. Hossack predeceasing her husband and he remarrying, or Dr. Hossack predeceasing his wife and she being forced during the balance of her lifetime to live on the estate of her late husband which had accumulated up to the date of his death, and so reduce the amount available for the infant son of the late Dr. and Mrs. Hossack and, therefore, the pecuniary benefit of which he was deprived by their untimely death. I think the second contingency may be dealt with very briefly. The fact is that Mrs. Hossack died in the accident which gave rise to this cause of action. The pecuniary benefit to her son, in whose interest the action is taken, as the result of any estate which she might have left had she lived out her ordinary life was slight and, therefore, what was in essence the trial judge\u2019s task was to determine the pecuniary benefit of which the son was deprived by the death in the accident of his father. The fact is that his father, the late Dr. Hossack, did not leave a widow who might live on the late Dr. Hossack\u2019s estate had he predeceased her at some future time. It might well be that the late Dr. Hossack, had he lived, might have remarried, but the effect of such remarriage on the pecuniary benefit which his son would receive on the date of his father\u2019s death, had it occurred under normal circumstances, and at a normal time, is altogether conjecture and I do not see how it could be allowed for with any intelligence in the affixing of the damages.\nI therefore find no error in principle in the learned trial judge\u2019s failure to consider this contingency, if he did so fail to consider it, and there is nothing in his reasons for judgment or in the endorsement of the record which indicated that he did fail to consider any proper element. It must be remembered that the learned trial judge said:\nI shall read the cases referred to by counsel and shall take into consideration all these factors required to be so taken into consideration and will endorse the record as to the amount of damages accordingly.\nThe question of the effect on the pecuniary benefit of which Brian Hossack was deprived by the untimely death of his parents, of the estate taxes, provincial and federal, is a. matter of some importance. It would appear from a perusal of the evidence of Mr. Lang, the actuary, who gave evidence on behalf of the plaintiffs at trial, that this witness found a probable gross estate which would come to the son upon the death of Dr. Hossack had it occurred under ordinary circumstances of $503,000. After estate duties, federal and provincial, were deducted therefrom at their present rates, it would leave only a net estate of $364,500. Using the same calculation as Mr. Lang that would have a present value of $81,885 rather than the present value of $113,000 which Mr. Lang calculated as being the present value of an estate of $503,000. However, it was counsel\u2019s submission that the learned trial judge appears to have made up his award of $94,000 by the addition of three amounts, (a) the present value of the probable future estate that Brian Hossack would have received upon the eventual passing of his father and mother under ordinary circumstances\n$50,000.\n(b) the cost of food, clothing, shelter and education for a 20-year period which the infant Brian would have received from his parents if they had lived\n$32,000.\n(c) the substantial loss suffered by the infant in losing the intellectual, moral and physical guidance and training which only a mother and father could give him\n$12,000.\nOn that basis, the trial judge reduced the $113,000 present value figure to which I have referred to $50,000 to allow for the many contingencies which might have interfered with the late Dr. Hossack leaving an estate as large as Mr. Lang calculated. That represents a reduction of 55.7 per cent. Had the present value been considered at $81,885, the reduction to $50,000 would only have represented a reduction to allow for the said contingencies of about 40 per cent. Had the reduction factor of approximately 56 per cent been used on the present value after such estate duties, then figure (a) in the calculation would have amounted to about $45,000 to $46,000 and added to figures (b) and (c) would have given a total damage award of about $90,000.\nI am unable to say that an award of $94,000 as damages under The Fatal Accidents Act is so inordinately higher than an award of $90,000 that it is a wholly erroneous estimate of the damages. There has been very considerable argument as to the propriety of both the $32,000 allowance under head (b) and the $12,000 allowance under (c) above. I am of the opinion that those objections constitute merely an attempt to supplant the estimate made by the trial judge with the estimate by the Court of Appeal or by counsel before this Court and that no matter of principle is involved.\nThere is, however, an additional factor which must be considered and it is the factor which deals with the establishment of a gross value of the estate of the late Dr. Hossack, had he lived his ordinary life, at $503,000. That amount was arrived at by the witness Lang by assuming that the late Dr. Hossack would have saved one-third of his net income and that those savings accumulated with interest for the 38 years of his normal life would have amounted at his death at the end of those 38 years to $503,000. The estimate that the late Dr. Hossack had saved one-third of his income was made by finding that those so-called savings amounted to $16,319 and that his total net income after deduction of taxes was $44,994. The $16,319 was a total which included a valuation of household goods, furniture and jewellery at $2,642, and two automobiles at $1,120, a total of $3,782. Certainly, it is difficult to understand how those items could be included under the heading of \u201csavings\u201d so that their capitalization at 4 per cent interest would build up into a gross estate in 38 years of $503,000. This would lead us to the conclusion that the actuary was incorrect in taking as the basis for his calculation that the late Dr. Hossack was saving one-third of his net income. In fact, usual living expenses, i.e., the purchase of furniture, household goods, jewellery and automobiles were erroneously included in that so-called saving of one-third of his net income. The capitalization of these amounts would appear to make inaccurate the calculated gross estate of the late Dr. Hossack, at normal death, of $503,000, and it would appear more accurate to say that the late Dr. Hossack saved only about 28 per cent of his net income. His total savings therefore would not have been the $212,292 calculated by Mr. Lang but about $178,000 and that total saving capitalized on the 4 per cent basis used by Mr. Lang would have yielded a gross estate at the time of death of about $422,000. This estate, after the allowance of estate duties, federal and provincial, would amount to approximately $305,803.\nThe present value of $503,000 is $113,000 and the present value of $305,803, therefore, would be about $68,500. If you allow about 56 per cent of that as being a proper figure to allow for contingencies you would reach an amount not of the $50,000 as apparently allowed by the learned trial judge but rather about $38,360 and if to that amount, as being the proper amount for category (a) supra, you add the same amounts for category (b)\u2014$32,000, and category (c)\u2014$12,000, you arrive at $82,360.\nTherefore, in my judgment, the proper allowance for damages under The Fatal Accidents Act should have been $82,360. In arriving at that figure, I believe that I have used the method of calculation adopted by the appellants and to which no objection was taken by counsel for the respondents, but I have based my calculation of the gross estate which the late Dr. Hossack might have expected to leave, had he died at a normal time and under normal circumstances, upon a more realistic estimate of his accumulated savings, and I have made allowance for the effect of estate duties, federal and provincial, which it would appear the learned trial judge, if he adopted the calculations made by Mr. Lang, failed to allow. In short, I have attempted to correct the two matters of principle upon which the trial judge seems to have fallen in error.\nIn doing so, I do not purport to deal with the question discussed in British Transport Commission v. Gourley[13], or in Jennings v. Cronsberry[14], as to whether or not deductions should be made in damage awards to a person who had been injured and thereby prevented from earning his living for, at any rate, a period of time to allow for tax on income which he would otherwise have earned. What must be determined in an action under The Fatal Accidents Act is the pecuniary benefit of which the person for whom the action has been instituted is deprived by the untimely death of the deceased. That pecuniary benefit, in my view, must be considered in the light of what such person will actually receive. What he actually will receive is the net estate after the deduction of estate duties and, therefore, an allowance must be made for the death duties in calculating the damages.\nI am, therefore, of the opinion that this Court should allow the appeal in the Gorman action and restore the judgment of the trial judge. Since the appellant in the Gorman action was successful throughout, the appellant should have costs at trial, in the Court of Appeal, and in this Court. This Court, by virtue of s. 46 of the Supreme Court Act, may \u201cgive the judgment and award the process or other proceedings that the Court whose decision is appealed against, should have given or awarded\u201d.\nI would allow the appeal in the Hossack action to the extent of varying the general damages from the sum of $65,000, as fixed in the Court of Appeal, to $82,360 which with other damages of $1,632.60 allowed at trial will result in a judgment in favour of the plaintiffs in that action for $83,992.60. Since the appellant in the Hossack action did not succeed in having restored the judgment at trial, I would leave in effect the disposition of costs made in the Court of Appeal, and I would allow no costs in this Court.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, SPENCE J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, appellants: Richardson, Macmillan, Rooke & MacLennan, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the defendants, respondents, Hertz Drive Yourself Stations of Ontario Ltd. and M.F.

They operated bingo games afternoons and evenings, six days per week, at which the daily attendance averaged 1,800 persons. The games were open to the public. The participants had to pay an admission fee of 50 cents, and if they wished to share in the prize money (and everybody did), they had to pay a further 50 cents. The respondents retained only the 50 cents admission fee; all other moneys received were returned on the same day as prizes to successful participants. The respondents were acquitted by the Court of Appeal. The Crown was granted leave to appeal to this Court on the question as to whether the premises were used by an incorporated bona fide social club within the meaning of s. 168(2) (a) of the Code.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the convictions restored.\nThe premises in question were not being used as a bona fide social club. Their use for bingo on such a wide-spread scale contradicted any possible inference of their use as a bona fide social club. The whole or a portion of the bets on or proceeds from the games were directly or indirectly paid to the keeper. The significant feature of subs. (2)(a)(i) of s. 168 is not the ultimate disposition of the moneys received by the keeper but the simple fact of payment to the keeper. It was also apparent that the respondents failed to qualify for the exemption under subs. (2)(a)(ii). It was impossible to break down what the participants paid into a 50 cents charge for admission and a further charge for the cards for the purpose of paying lip service to the requirements of that subsection. The word \"persons\" in subs. (2)(a)(ii) means persons who play bingo in premises while used by a social club in a bona fide manner in keeping with the objects for which it was incorporated.\nDroit criminel\u2014Maison de jeu\u2014Local occup\u00e9 par une branche de la L\u00e9gion canadienne\u2014Bingo\u2014S'agit-il d'un club social authentique\u2014Code criminel, 1953-1954 (Can.), c. 51, arts. 168(2)(a)(i), (ii), 176.\nLes intim\u00e9s, une branche de la L\u00e9gion canadienne constitu\u00e9e en corporation et son secr\u00e9taire, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9s coupables sur une accusation d'avoir tenu une maison de jeu, contrairement \u00e0 l'art. 176 du Code criminel. Ils exploitaient des jeux de bingo l'apr\u00e8s-midi et le soir, six jours par semaine, et auxquels 1,800 personnes assistaient en moyenne chaque jour. Les jeux \u00e9taient accessibles au public. Les joueurs devaient payer une cotisation d'admission de 50 sous, et s'ils d\u00e9siraient obtenir des prix, ils devaient payer une autre somme de 50 sous, ce que tous les joueurs faisaient. Les intim\u00e9s gardaient seulement le 50 sous de cotisation d'admission; tous les autres argents re\u00e7us \u00e9taient remis le m\u00eame jour comme prix aux joueurs gagnants. Le verdict de culpabilit\u00e9 fut renvers\u00e9 par la Cour d'Appel. La Couronne a obtenu la permission d'en appeler devant cette Cour sur la question de savoir si le local en question \u00e9tait utilis\u00e9 par un club social authentique constitu\u00e9 en corporation selon le sens de l'art. 168(2) (a) du Code.\nArr\u00eat: L'appel doit \u00eatre maintenu et le verdict de culpabilit\u00e9 r\u00e9tabli.\nLe local en question n'\u00e9tait pas utilis\u00e9 comme club social authentique. Son usage pour des jeux de bingo sur une \u00e9chelle aussi \u00e9tendue contredisait toute inf\u00e9rence possible qu'il pouvait \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 comme club social authentique.

Appel maintenu.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, reversing a conviction. Appeal allowed.\nW. G. Burke-Robertson, Q.C., for the appellant.\nW. J. Wallace, for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014The respondents were charged under s. 176 of the Criminal Code with keeping a common gaming house. The issue in the appeal is whether the case is covered by the exception contained in s. 168(2) (a) of the Criminal Code, which reads:\n(2) A place is not a common gaming house within the meaning of subparagraph (i) or clause (B) or (C) of subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (d) of subsection (1) (a) while it is occupied and used by an incorporated bona fide social club or branch thereof if\n(i) the whole or any portion of the bets on or proceeds from games played therein is not directly or indirectly paid to the keeper thereof, and\n(ii) no fee in excess of ten cents an hour or fifty cents a day is charged to persons for the right or privilege of participating in the games played therein;\u2026\nThe accused were convicted by the magistrate but acquitted on appeal. Leave to appeal was granted to this Court on the following question of law:\nWas the place No. 2655 Main Street, Vancouver, in the circumstances of the charge, used by an incorporated bona fide social club within the meaning of Section 168, Subsection (2)(a) of the Criminal Code of Canada?\nThe facts are not in dispute. The respondent, Branch 177 of the Royal Canadian Legion, is an incorporated branch of the Royal Canadian Legion. The respondent Elmer MacDonald is the secretary-manager of Branch 177. The premises occupied by Branch 177 are at 2655 Main Street, Vancouver, a building constructed and owned by Mount Pleasant War Memorial Community Co-operative Association, which was organized by and operated by Legion members. This building consists of four floors, including the basement. The basement is leased to persons who run a bowling alley. The other three floors are leased to Branch 177 for an annual rental of approximately $75,000. The first floor is used for bingo games afternoons and evenings, six days per week, at which the daily attendance has averaged 1,800 persons.\nMembers of the public wishing to play bingo were admitted upon payment of a fifty cent admission fee. In order to participate in prize money, a further fifty cents was then paid. Although it was possible to play bingo without payment of a further fifty cents, and without, therefore, the right to participate in prize money, no one did so. The evidence of the respondent MacDonald was that this rule came into effect in 1962 but that no one availed himself of the opportunity although nearly half a million persons played bingo in this establishment in the year 1963 alone.\nThe opportunity to share in the prize money came from the sale of cards at fifty cents and a dollar each. Branch 177 retained only the fifty cent admission fee; all other moneys received were returned on the same day as prizes to successful participants.\nOn these undisputed facts, the prosecution succeeds on the ground that 2655 Main Street was not being used as a bona fide social club. It was a place open to the public without discrimination and in daily use as a centre of public gambling. Nothing turns in this case upon s. 168(3), which places the onus on the accused of proving that a place is not a common gaming house. The undisputed facts speak for themselves. The public was admitted on payment of a fifty cent admission fee. Then, if they wished, they could all participate in gambling, and they all did. This is not occupation and use by a bona fide social club. It is unnecessary to go into the objects of the Canadian Legion or its incorporated Branch 177. The use of these premises for bingo on such a widespread scale contradicts any possible inference of the use as a bona fide social club.\nThe whole or a portion of the bets on or proceeds from the games played at 2655 Main Street were directly or indirectly paid to the keeper. The respondents were required to show under s. 168(3) that this was not so in order to come within the exception. Again, nothing turns upon presumptions or onus of proof. The evidence is clear that the admission fees collected at the door plus all further moneys received from players were paid to cashiers and persons selling cards and tickets who were assisting and acting on behalf of Branch 177. These persons and Branch 177 were keepers within the meaning of the section. All the moneys were paid to the keeper directly and the keeper then retained all admission fees and disbursed the other moneys paid by players in the form of prizes for those who won. The significant feature of subs. (2) (a) (i) is not the ultimate disposition of the moneys received by the keeper but the simple fact of payment to the keeper. This alone is sufficient to take the respondents outside the operation of subs. (2) (a) (i).\nOn the above facts it is also apparent that the respondents failed to qualify for the exemption under subs. (2)(a)(ii). More than fifty cents per day was charged to persons for the right or privilege of participating in the games. Again, it is clear on the evidence that all those who went to the premises, went for the purpose of participating in the game in the hope of winning a prize. All bingo players during the period covered by the charge and as far back as 1962 paid more than fifty cents per day. It is impossible to break down what they paid into a fifty cent charge for admission and a further charge for the cards for the purpose of paying lip service to the requirements of subs. (2) (a) (ii).\nBoth the learned magistrate and the Court of Appeal felt that it was necessary to put an interpretation on the word \"persons\" in subs. (2)(a)(ii). The magistrate held that the word meant persons who were members of the club or guests of the members of the club. The Court of Appeal was of the contrary opinion and held that the word was completely general in its scope. One must, however, read the section as a whole. There are only two exceptions to the general definition of \"common gaming house\". These are social clubs and charitable or religious organizations. We are not concerned with the latter in this case. They may hold an occasional bingo if the proceeds go to charity. The other exception is \"use or occupation by an incorporated bona fide social club\" on certain conditions. In this context the word \"persons\" in subs. (2) (a) (ii) means persons who play bingo in premises while used by a social club in a bona fide manner in keeping with the objects for which it was incorporated. It does not mean the public at large who played bingo in the circumstances of the charge, because the social club, assuming that it was one, was not being operated in a bona fide manner.\nI would answer the question on which leave was granted in the negative and restore the conviction of both respondents.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: S. M. Toy, Vancouver.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W. J. Wallace, Vancouver.\n",

Requ\u00eate rejet\u00e9e.\nAPPLICATION for a writ of habeas corpus referred to the Court by the Rota Judge. Application dismissed.\nNo one appearing for the applicant.\nC. M. Powell, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014By notice in writing, dated February 5, 1965, Robert Terry Morrison, hereinafter referred to as 'the applicant\", applied to this Court for a writ of habeas corpus and certiorari. The application was referred to the Court by the Rota Judge.\nIt appears from the certified copy of the warrant of committal which accompanied the application that the applicant was convicted in the County of York before the late Magistrate F. W. Bartrem on February 17, 1961, upon a charge of robbery and that on February 27, 1961, he was sentenced to be imprisoned in the penitentiary for the term of fifteen years. Pursuant to that warrant of committal he is now confined in the penitentiary in British Columbia.\nAt the request of the Court counsel for the Attorney General for Ontario has furnished us with a copy of the record of the proceedings in regard to the above charge in the Court of Appeal for Ontario.\nFrom this it appears that the applicant pleaded guilty to the charge of robbery, that in August 1964 he applied to the Court of Appeal for Ontario for an extension of time for leave to appeal in writing against his conviction, that on October 20, 1964, that application was refused, that thereafter, in November 1964, he applied to the Court of Appeal for Ontario for an extension of time for leave to appeal in writing against his sentence and that on December 1, 1964, that application was refused.\nThe grounds put forward by the applicant in writing in the Court of Appeal were that he was improperly induced by fraud and threats to elect trial by the Magistrate and to plead guilty.\nIt is clear from the record that a writ of habeas corpus cannot be granted as the warrant of committal shews that the applicant is confined in execution of a legal sentence, imposed by a court having jurisdiction, after conviction for the offence of robbery and that the sentence has not expired.\nEven if the applicant had sought leave to appeal to this Court from either of the orders of the Court of Appeal it is clear that no relief could have been granted to him. The jurisdiction of this Court in criminal matters is strictly limited. As regards the sentence this Court has no jurisdiction; as regards the conviction there was no dissenting judgment in the Court of Appeal and the grounds on which in that Court the applicant sought to question his conviction did not include any ground of law in the strict sense. In such circumstances this Court has no jurisdiction. Mention has been made in these reasons only of the conviction on the charge of robbery; the applicant at the same time as he pleaded guilty to that charge also pleaded guilty to other charges but the sentences imposed in regard thereto were made concurrent with that on the charge of robbery.\nBy a letter addressed to the Registrar of the Court the applicant stated that he wished to appear before the Court in person on this application. As the material, including the statements of the applicant, makes it clear that no relief could be afforded to him by this Court nothing would be gained by adjourning the matter to enable him to make the necessary arrangements to be brought before the Court.\nThe application for a writ of habeas corpus and certiorari is dismissed.\nApplication dismissed.\n",

The collision occurred as the ships were passing through a narrow channel. The trial judge, sitting with two assessors, fixed the liability of the Ivanhoe at 85 per cent and that of the Western Spray at 15 per cent. The defendant company appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe apportionment of liability should not be varied. The fault of the Western Spray in being too close to the mid-channel, as found by the trial judge and against which finding the plaintiff did not appeal, was in no way comparable to that of the Ivanhoe. The latter ship was operating in a dense fog at a speed which prevented her from slowing down or altering course effectively within the area of the prevailing visibility; she was not keeping to her proper side of mid-channel; had no look-out and was depending upon a radar which was not properly tended.

Appel rejet\u00e9.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Norris D.J.A., for the District of British Columbia. Appeal dismissed.\nD. McK. Brown, Q.C., for the defendant, appellant.\nJ. I. Bird, Q.C., for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of Mr. Justice Norris, District Judge in Admiralty of the Admiralty District of British Columbia, sitting with two assessors, whereby he found the tugboat Ivanhoe to be chiefly to blame for a collision which occurred at 10 a.m. on September 20, 1962, when she was leaving Vancouver Harbour in dense fog and ran into the inbound fishing vessel Western Spray in Burrard Inlet just outside the First Narrows Bridge. There was no wind, the sea was flat and the learned trial judge has found that the tide was running between 2 and 3 knots against the Ivanhoe.\nThe Ivanhoe, owned by the appellant company, is a power tug of 185.98 gross tons with an approximate length of 110 to 115 feet overall; she was manned by a crew of 7 and fitted with all the usual navigational aids including radio-telephone, magnetic compass and radar. The Western Spray, of which the respondent was the owner and master at the time of the collision, is a power-driven fishing vessel of 55.16 gross tons with an approximate length of 66 feet overall. She was manned by a crew of 6 and fitted with magnetic compass, radio-telephone and depth recorder but no radar.\nThere does not appear to be any dispute as to the fact that Burrard Inlet constitutes a narrow channel within the meaning of Rule 25(a) of the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, (hereinafter referred to as the Regulations), which reads as follows:\nRule 25(a) In a narrow channel every power-driven vessel when proceeding along the course of the channel shall, when it is safe and practicable, keep to that side of the fairway or mid-channel which lies on the starboard side of such vessel.\nThis rule, like the other \"Steering and Sailing Rules\", is required to be obeyed in accordance with the preliminary paragraphs of Part C of the Regulations, the first of which provides that:\n1. In obeying and construing these Rules, any action taken should be positive, in ample time, and with due regard to the observance of good seamanship.\nIn the circumstances of the present case, it was the duty of the Ivanhoe to keep to the north side of the channel and of the Western Spray to keep to the south. Mr. Justice Norris was unable to determine the exact point of collision, but it is clear from his reasons for judgment that he found it to have taken place to the south of mid channel. In this regard he says:\nOn the whole of the acceptable evidence, while the point of collision cannot be fixed exactly, Perdia had navigated his vessel so as to get his vessel into the First Narrows Channel. I find that as a matter of wise precaution he should have kept more to the south of the channel in view of fog conditions, but I do not find on the evidence that he was in the north half of the channel.\nI agree with this assessment of the situation.\nBoth the ships' masters claim to have been sounding the necessary fog signals, but neither heard nor detected the presence of the other until their stems were seen emerging from the fog by their respective crews, by which time they were approaching end on end at a distance of about fifty feet apart and the collision was virtually inevitable.\nThe true cause of this collision is not to be found in the actions of the tug and the fishing vessel after they had sighted each other. In seeking to attribute fault in such cases it is in my opinion necessary to examine the conduct of both vessels as they approached the area of collision in an effort to determine whether either of them could have foreseen the approaching danger and, by the exercise of reasonable care, have prevented the confrontation at close quarters from ever occurring at all.\nThe engineer of the Ivanhoe, whose evidence was believed by the learned trial judge, testified that after backing out from the ferry dock to proceed seaward her speed was set at \"half ahead\", amounting to 4 1\/2 to 5 knots, which was maintained until the time of collision and that, with the heavy engine running at that speed, the master's order of \"full astern\" given upon sighting the Western Spray did not become effective to take any \"way\" off the tug before the impact. The master also ordered the helm \"hard to starboard\" and as to the effect of this order he says:\nQ. Did your vessel respond to the helm change prior to the collision?\nA. Just, just, because she's a big, heavy ship.\nQ. She responds slowly, does she?\nA. Slowly.\nIn this regard the helmsman stated under cross-examination:\nQ. Can you recall seeing the Western Spray prior to the collision?\nA. Recall seeing her?\nQ. Yes, or any part of it before the collision?\nA. I remember the Captain telling me that we were going to hit, and hard to starboard, and I spun the wheel and by the time I looked up we were there.\nI take it from this evidence that the tug had not fully responded to the helm order before the ships came together.\nFrom the time of leaving the dock until the collision, the Ivanhoe's master appears to have been navigating by radar, although he was also able to check his position from calls received by radio-telephone from the officer on duty in the radar-equipped station on the First Narrows Bridge. No lookouts were posted. When the Ivanhoe's radar set was tested more than a month after the collision, the \"echoes\" were found to be weak but the evidence of the ship's master, who was the only person to use the set on the day in question is that \"it worked perfectly\". The evidence of the radar expert called on behalf of the appellant satisfies me that the steel work on the First Narrows Bridge did not offer any real interference with radar reception and I think it to be more probable than not that the explanation of the master's failure to detect any echo of the Western Spray, which had been almost directly in front of him for some time, is that he was not observing his set with the care which the circumstances required or that he was not operating it properly although he would, in my view, have been equally to blame for placing reliance on a radar containing a weakness which he had failed to detect.\nThe Western Spray, shortly before reaching the immediate area of the collision, had reduced her speed to 3 knots through the water. She was lighter and more easily maneuverable than the Ivanhoe and her engine was controlled by a throttle in the wheel house. The master says that upon sighting the Ivanhoe he put his engines \"full astern\" and that while he was running back to the galley so as to get away from the impending impact, he saw that his ship had already started moving in reverse. I agree with the learned trial judge that it is probable that before the actual impact, the reversing of the engine had already had the effect of moving the bow of the Western Spray to port which accounts for the fact that it was the starboard side of the vessel which was struck by the stem of the Ivanhoe and, notwithstanding the evidence of the helmsman and the master of the Ivanhoe, I am satisfied that there was little or no forward movement to the Western Spray at the time of the collision.\nThe master of the Western Spray, having no radar, had posted four lookouts, two in the bow and two above the wheel house and he was judging his position in the harbour by the sound signals which were coming from the First Narrows beacon on the north shore and the Prospect Point light on the south. The sounding of these signals was being reported to him by the lookouts in the bow, one of whom was stationed in the stem of the vessel and the other within hearing distance of the wheel house. According to her master, Western Spray was in aproximately mid channel on a course of 70 degrees magnetic, and I agree with the learned trial judge that she was too close to the center line although, as has been said, she was not in the north half of the channel.\nThe main fault which counsel for the appellant attributed to the Western Spray was that although she had no radar, the master could have communicated by radio-telephone with the officer on duty on the First Narrows Bridge, and that if he had done so he would have been made aware of the presence of the Ivanhoe in time to take avoiding action.\nIt is true that the master of the Western Spray did not appear to understand how to communicate with the bridge station effectively by telephone and that because he called on the wrong radio band he could not get in touch with it. I think that he was negligent in this respect, but the only effective action for him to have taken if he had received the information which the bridge officer had to give him would have been to move further to the south of the Channel and the failure to do this is the fault which has been found against the Western Spray by Mr. Justice Norris who says:\n\u2026the master of the Western Spray was at fault in proceeding in the fog too close to the center of the Channel. In other respects he was not at fault.\nThe respondent does not appeal from this finding.\nIt appears to be desirable to comment on the evidence of the officer who was on duty on the bridge who testified very definitely that according to the picture seen by him on his radar screen, the two ships were proceeding on courses which should have enabled them to pass each other in safety when the Western Spray suddenly turned to port at an angle of about 70 degrees directly across the path of the Ivanhoe. This evidence would, of course, have concluded the matter in favour of the Ivanhoe if it had been accepted but Mr. Justice Norris clearly rejected it and concluded that the Western Spray made no such turn to port as that described by this witness. I am not prepared to depart from the assessment of this evidence made by the learned trial judge.\nI find that in dense fog the Ivanhoe was operating at a speed which prevented her from slowing down or altering course effectively within the area of the prevailing visibility; she was not keeping to her proper side of mid channel, had no lookout and was depending upon a radar which was not being properly tended. In this latter regard I adopt the view expressed by Mr. Justice Willmer in The Anna Salen[1], where he said:\nThese scientific installations, and particularly, radar, are potentially most valuable instruments for increasing safety at sea; but they only remain valuable if they are intelligently used, and if the officers responsible for working them work them and interpret them with intelligence. That is only another way, I think, of saying that a good look-out must be maintained. A good look-out involves not only a visual look-out, and not only the use of ears, but it also involves the intelligent interpretation of the data received by way of these various scientific instruments.\n(The italics are my own.)\nIt appears to me that if the tug's radar had been constantly and intelligently observed by its master, he would have had warning of the presence of the Western Spray in time to take action as to both course and speed so that the two vessels would not have met as they did.\nIt was contended on behalf of the appellant that, taking into account the set of the tide against her, the speed at which the Ivanhoe was going was a moderate one within the meaning of Rule 16(a) of the Regulations which requires that in fog every vessel shall \"go at a moderate speed having careful regard to existing circumstances and conditions\".\nThe speed of the Ivanhoe could certainly not be characterized as immoderate under conditions of clear visibility but the governing consideration in the present case is that in the dense fog that speed was such that, to use the language employed by Mellish L.J.A. in The Ship Clackamas v. The Schooner Cape d'Or, approved in this Court[2] by Newcombe J., at page 336, the Ivanhas\nWas unable to avoid a collision with the vessel from which she was bound to keep clear, and the risk of whose proximity she would reasonably be assumed to anticipate under existing conditions.\nThis was an immoderate speed having regard to \"existing circumstances and conditions\". The same considerations do not apply to the Western Spray a lighter vessel the reversal of whose engine had become effective before the collision.\nMr. Justice Norris fixed the liability of the Ivanhoe at 85 per cent and that of the Western Spray at 15 per cent. I would not vary this apportionment as I consider that the fault of the Western Spray in being too close to mid channel was in no way comparable to that of the Ivanhoe in proceeding on her wrong side of the channel at a speed and on a course which could not be effectively altered within the prevailing limits of visibility and in relying upon a radar which was not being properly observed or intelligently interpreted.\nI would accordingly dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Russell & Du-Moulin, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: Campney, Owen & Murphy, Vancouver.\n[1] [1954] 1 Lioyd\u2019s Rep. 475 at 488.\n[2] [1926] S.C.R. 331 at 336, 1 D.L.R. 384.\n",

Voulant r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer ces deux immeubles, l'appelant Morin con\u00e7ut le projet d'en faire l'acquisition par l'interm\u00e9diaire de son fils. Ce dernier, \u00e0 la suite d'une entente verbale avec son p\u00e8re, acheta les deux immeubles du syndic \u00e0 la faillite. Quelques mois plus tard, Morin fils, sans l'assentiment de son p\u00e8re, vendit la ferme \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e Mar-Mic Farm Inc., compagnie qui ne devait \u00eatre incorpor\u00e9e que trois mois plus tard. Dans son action pour r\u00e9clamer les deux propri\u00e9t\u00e9s, Morin p\u00e8re all\u00e9gua qu'il fut convenu verbalement que son fils agirait comme son pr\u00eate-nom, lui r\u00e9troc\u00e9derait les immeubles sur demande et serait rembours\u00e9 des argents d\u00e9bours\u00e9s par lui aussit\u00f4t que son p\u00e8re pourrait le faire.\nLe juge au proc\u00e8s fit droit \u00e0 la demande de Morin p\u00e8re; il le d\u00e9clara propri\u00e9taire de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9sidentielle et annula la vente de la ferme qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite \u00e0 Mar-Mic Farm Inc. La Cour d'Appel d\u00e9clara Morin p\u00e8re propri\u00e9taire de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9sidentielle, mais d\u00e9clara que la vente de la ferme \u00e9tait valide. Morin p\u00e8re interjeta appel \u00e0 cette Cour et Morin fils, dans un contre-appel, attaqua la d\u00e9cision d\u00e9clarant son p\u00e8re propri\u00e9taire de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9sidentielle.\nArr\u00eat: Les appels de Morin p\u00e8re doivent \u00eatre maintenus et le contre-appel de Morin fils doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9.\nLa preuve testimoniale concernant la nature de l'entente verbale entre le p\u00e8re et le fils \u00e9tait admissible\u2014il existait un commencement de preuve par \u00e9crit au sens du para. 7 de I'art. 1233 du Code civil\u2014et cette preuve consid\u00e9r\u00e9e avec tout ce que r\u00e9v\u00e8le le dossier \u00e9tablissait de fa\u00e7on pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rante les pr\u00e9ventions de Morin p\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019effet que son fils devait agir comme son pr\u00eate-nom. Morin fils n'a donc jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 propri\u00e9taire des deux immeubles, et il s'ensuit que son p\u00e8re avait droit d'en obtenir la r\u00e9trocession. II s'ensuit aussi que Morin p\u00e8re avait droit de demander que l'acte de vente relatif \u00e0 la ferme soit d\u00e9clare inexistant parce que Mar-Mic Farm Inc., d\u00e9sign\u00e9e comme acheteur, n'avait aucune existence juridique \u00e0 la date de cet acte de vente et de son enregistrement, et que ce d\u00e9faut n'\u00e9tait pas autrement couvert. II n'y avait aucune preuve au dossier de la constitution d'un fid\u00e9icommis au sens et aux fins indiqu\u00e9s aux dispositions de I'art. 29 de la Loi des compagnies de Qu\u00e9bec. Les dispositions de cet article ne pouvaient pas \u00eatre \u00e9tendues au cas pr\u00e9sent. La pr\u00e9vention des intim\u00e9s que l'action ne pouvait r\u00e9ussir parce que pr\u00e9alablement \u00e0 son institution ils n'avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 rembours\u00e9s des argents qu'ils avaient avanc\u00e9s, ne peut pas \u00eatre support\u00e9e. Suivant la convention verbale le fils devait sur simple demande, et sans autre condition, r\u00e9troc\u00e9der les immeubles \u00e0 son p\u00e8re.\nImmovables\u2014Sale\u2014Action to set aside\u2014Verbal agreement\u2014Admissibility\u2014Pr\u00eate-nom\u2014Purchaser a company not yet incorporated\u2014Civil Code, art. 12SS, para. 7\u2014Quebec Companies Act, R.S.Q. 1941, c. S76, s. 29.\nThe assets of a bankrupt company which had been controlled by the appellant Morin included, inter alia, two immovable properties: one upon which was situated the family residence and the other, a farm. Desiring to regain these two properties, the appellant Morin conceived the scheme of acquiring them through his son. The latter, following a verbal agreement with his father, bought the two properties from the trustee in bankruptcy. A few months later, the son, without the consent of his father, sold the farm to the respondent Mar-Mic Farm Inc., a company which was only incorporated some three months later. In his action claiming the two properties, the father alleged that it had been agreed verbally that his son would act as his pr\u00eate-nom, would reconvey the properties upon demand and would be reimbursed of the moneys laid out by him as soon as the father could do it. The trial judge maintained the father's action; he declared him to be the owner of the residential property and set aside the sale of the farm which had been made to Mar-Mic Farm Inc. The Court of Appeal declared that the father was the owner of the residential property, but found that the sale of the farm was valid. The father appealed to this Court, and the son cross-appealed against the decision declaring his father to be the owner of the residential property.\nHeld: The appeals of the father should be maintained and the cross-appeal of the son should be dismissed.\nThe oral proof concerning the nature of the verbal agreement between the father and the son was admissible\u2014there being a commencement of proof in writing within the meaning of art. 1233, para. 7 of the Civil Code\u2014and this oral proof, considered with all that was to be found in the record, established preponderantly the contentions of the father to the effect that his son was to act as his pr\u00eate-nom. Consequently the son had never been the owner of the two properties, and it follows that the father had the right to obtain a reconveyance. It follows also that the father had the right to demand that the deed of sale concerning the farm be declared non-existent because Mar-Mic Farm Inc., designated as the purchaser, had no legal existence at the date of the deed of sale and its registration, and that this deficiency was not otherwise covered. There was no evidence in the record that a trust within the meaning and objects of the provisions of s. 29 of the Quebec Companies Act had been created. The provisions of that section could not therefore be extended to the present case. The respondent's contention that the action could not succeed because, before its institution, they had not been reimbursed of the moneys which they had advanced, could not succeed. According to the verbal agreement the son was obligated upon demand, and without any other condition, to reconvey the properties to his father.\nAPPEALS and cross-appeal from three judgments of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec[1], affirming in part the judgment of Marchand J.

Le jugement de la Cour fut rendu par\nLE JUGE FAUTEUX:\u2014L'appelant J.-Alonzo Morin et les : membres de sa famille d\u00e9tenaient respectivement la presque totalit\u00e9 et la balance des actions de la compagnie Ferme Etchemin Limit\u00e9e lorsque celle-ci tomba en faillite et qu'\u00e9ventuellement la vente de son actif s'av\u00e9ra in\u00e9luctable. Cet actif comprenait particuli\u00e8rement deux propri\u00e9t\u00e9s immobili\u00e8res dont l'une sise au village de St-Henri de L\u00e9vis sur laquelle se trouvait la maison familiale des Morin et l'autre, une ferme situ\u00e9e \u00e0 un ou deux milles du village, d\u00e9sign\u00e9e sous le nom de Ferme Etchemin et utilis\u00e9e pour l'\u00e9levage et I'entra\u00eenement des chevaux de course. Morin p\u00e8re voulut naturellement r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer ces deux immeubles qu'il consid\u00e9rait comme son bien. Vu les ennuis que lui faisaient les syndics \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, il con\u00e7ut le projet d'en faire indirectement l'acquisition par I'interm\u00e9diaire de Provincial Hardwoods Inc.,\u2014compagnie qu'il fit incorporer \u00e0 ces fins\u2014 ou par l'interm\u00e9diaire de son fils, l'intim\u00e9, Jacques Morin, r\u00e9cemment admis \u00e0 la pratique de la m\u00e9decine. A la suite de diverses tractations et en ex\u00e9cution d'une entente verbale entre lui et son fils Jacques, ce dernier se porta acqu\u00e9reur des deux immeubles et ce par un acte de vente intervenu le 18 f\u00e9vrier 1959 entre lui et les syndics et subs\u00e9quemment enregistr\u00e9 au Bureau d'enregistrement de la division d'enregistrement concern\u00e9e. Les deux propri\u00e9t\u00e9s furent achet\u00e9es au prix de $25,000 pay\u00e9s comptant, dont $5,200 contribu\u00e9s par Jacques Morin, ses fr\u00e8res et ses s\u0153urs; $15,000, produit d'une obligation souscrite en faveur de United Loan Corporation par Jacques Morin comme d\u00e9biteur principal et son p\u00e8re comme caution, et la balance, $4,800, ainsi que les frais encourus s'\u00e9levant \u00e0 plus de $1,000, furent pay\u00e9s par Morin p\u00e8re. Quelques mois plus tard, soit le 17 novembre 1959, Morin fils, sans l'assentiment de son p\u00e8re, signait un acte de vente aux termes duquel il vendait la ferme \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e Mar-Mic Farm Inc. et ce pour un prix de $24,300. Ce sont la les faits qui, en somme, donn\u00e8rent naissance au pr\u00e9sent litige.\nMorin p\u00e8re pr\u00e9tendant qu'il est propri\u00e9taire des deux propri\u00e9t\u00e9s immobili\u00e8res demanda par action la reconnaissance de son droit. Suivant lui, ce qui fut verbalement convenu entre lui et son fils, pr\u00e9alablement \u00e0 la signature de I'acte de vente par Iequel ce dernier se portait acqu\u00e9reur des immeubles en question, fut que le fils agirait, dans la circonstance, comme pr\u00eate-nom de son p\u00e8re, lui r\u00e9troc\u00e9derait ces immeubles sur demande et serait rembours\u00e9 des argents d\u00e9bours\u00e9s par lui, ses fr\u00e8res et s\u0153urs, aussit\u00f4t que le p\u00e8re pourrait ce faire. D'autre part et suivant le fils, tout ce dont il a convenu fut d'accorder \u00e0 son p\u00e8re un droit de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence de racheter les biens en question avant l'expiration de l'\u00e9t\u00e9 1959 en lui remboursant sans d\u00e9lai tout l 'argent qu'il investirait, tant personnellement que pour le compte de ses fr\u00e8res et s\u0153urs, et toutes les d\u00e9penses que lui entra\u00eenerait l'achat de ces biens. Ainsi donc et sur ce premier aspect du litige, la question soumise est de savoir si la preuve testimoniale concernant la nature de cette entente verbale entre p\u00e8re et fils est admissible et, dans l\u2019affirmative, si elle \u00e9tablit les pr\u00e9tentions du p\u00e8re. S'il faut r\u00e9pondre affirmativement \u00e0 ces deux questions, Morin fils n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 propri\u00e9taire de ces immeubles et n'avait aucun droit de vendre la ferme \u00e0 qui que ce soit. II s'ensuivrait que Morin p\u00e8re a droit d'\u00eatre reconnu propri\u00e9taire de l'immeuble sur lequel se trouve la maison familiale et m\u00eame aussi de la ferme si, comme il le pr\u00e9tend\u2014et c'est l\u00e0 le second aspect du litige\u2014la vente de cette ferme par Morin fils \u00e0 Mar-Mic Farm Inc. doit \u00eatre (i) d\u00e9clar\u00e9e nulle parce qu'entach\u00e9e de fraude attribuable \u00e0 Morin fils et \u00e0 Marc-Andr\u00e9 Blouin instigateur de cette vente et de l'incorporation de Mar-Mic Farm Inc. ou (ii) d\u00e9clar\u00e9e inexistante parce qu'au 17 novembre 1959, date de cet acte de vente, Mar-Mic Farm Inc. qui y appara\u00eet comme acheteur, n'avait aucune existence juridique n'ayant, en fait, \u00e9t\u00e9 incorpor\u00e9e que le 23 f\u00e9vrier 1960.\nDans un jugement tr\u00e8s \u00e9labor\u00e9 comportant, outre une appr\u00e9ciation d\u00e9favorable concernant la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de Jacques Morin et les agissements de Marc-Andr\u00e9 Blouin, une analyse minutieuse de toutes les circonstances r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9es par le dossier, la preuve \u00e9crite et testimoniale, M. le Juge Marchand, de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure, accepta comme bien fond\u00e9es les pr\u00e9tentions de Morin p\u00e8re, accueillit sa demande, rejeta les contestations de Morin fils et de Marc-Andr\u00e9 Blouin ainsi que I 'intervention de Mar-Mic Farm Inc. II n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de rapporter ici au complet le dispositif du jugement lequel a pour objet diff\u00e9rents sujets d'ordre plut\u00f4t accessoire au sujet principal; il suffit de dire que Morin p\u00e8re est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 propri\u00e9taire de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9sidentielle, que I'acte de vente du 17 novembre 1959 consenti par Jacques Morin \u00e0 Mar-Mic Farm Inc. en ce qui concerne la ferme est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 nul parce qu'entach\u00e9 de fraude et inexistant en raison de I'inexistence l\u00e9gale de I\u2019 acqu\u00e9reur ; et il est ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 Morin p\u00e8re de payer \u00e0 Morin fils par versements et \u00e0 des dates d\u00e9termin\u00e9es, la somme de $4,900 repr\u00e9sentant la balance due sur le produit de la cotisation faite entre Morin fils et ses fr\u00e8res et s\u0153urs.\nMorin fils, Marc-Andr\u00e9 Blouin et Mar-Mic Farm Inc. appel\u00e8rent de ce jugement. Ces trois appels s\u00e9par\u00e9s furent entendus simultan\u00e9ment et d\u00e9cid\u00e9s subs\u00e9quemment le m\u00eame jour. Les Juges de la Cour du banc de la reine[3] se divis\u00e8rent. Alors que M. le Juge Casey les aurait tous maintenus avec d\u00e9pens, M. le Juge Rivard les aurait tous rejet\u00e9s, sans frais, tout en modifiant le jugement de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure en retranchant l'ordonnance relative au remboursement de la balance due sur la cotisation pour r\u00e9server \u00e0 Jacques Morin les droits et recours qu'il pouvait avoir \u00e0 ce sujet. Pour leur part, M. le Juge en chef et MM. les Juges Choquette et Montgomery (i) maintiennent l'appel (N\u00b0 6118) de Jacques Morin contre son p\u00e8re et Provincial Hardwoods Inc. et proc\u00e9dant \u00e0 rendre le jugement qui, \u00e0 leur avis, aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre rendu en Cour sup\u00e9rieure, ils d\u00e9clarent Morin p\u00e8re propri\u00e9taire de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9sidentielle \u00e0 compter de la date de l'institution de l'action, et ce pour des motifs autres que ceux retenus en Cour sup\u00e9rieure, sans frais; (ii) ils maintiennent l'appel (N\u00b0 6119) de Marc-Andr\u00e9 Blouin et (iii) l'appel (N\u00b0 6117) de Mar-Mic Farm Inc. log\u00e9s contre Morin p\u00e8re et Provincial Hardwoods Inc., avec d\u00e9pens.\nMorin p\u00e8re et Provincial Hardwoods Inc. ont interjet\u00e9 appel \u00e0 cette Cour \u00e0 l'encontre de ces trois jugements et, dans un contre-appel, Jacques Morin attaque la d\u00e9cision suivant laquelle son p\u00e8re fut d\u00e9clar\u00e9 propri\u00e9taire de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9sidentielle.\nSur le premier aspect du litige, soit la question de l'admissibilit\u00e9 et valeur probante de la preuve testimoniale concer- nant la nature de la convention verbale entre Morin p\u00e8re et Morin fils relativement \u00e0 la vente des deux propri\u00e9t\u00e9s immobili\u00e8res, je dirais, en toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence pour ceux qui entretiennent l'opinion contraire, que pour les raisons ci-apr\u00e8s indiqu\u00e9es, je partage les vues de M. le Juge Rivard de la Cour d'Appel, qui lui-m\u00eame confirme l'opinion du Juge de premi\u00e8re instance tant sur l'admissibilit\u00e9 de la preuve testimoniale que sur le fait que cette preuve consid\u00e9r\u00e9e avec tout ce que r\u00e9v\u00e8le le dossier \u00e9tablit de fa\u00e7on pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rante les pr\u00e9ventions de Morin p\u00e8re sur la nature de cette convention verbale.\nSur l'admissibilit\u00e9. II ne s'agit pas ici de contredire ou changer les termes de cet acte de vente des syndics \u00e0 la faillite de Ferme Etchemin Limit\u00e9e \u00e0 Jacques Morin. II s'agit de d\u00e9terminer la nature d'une convention qui\u2014de l'aveu m\u00eame de l'intim\u00e9 Jacques Morin\u2014est une convention verbale distincte de l'acte de vente des syndics \u00e0 Jacques Morin, tant en raison de l'objet propre a cette convention verbale qu'en raison des parties entre lesquelles elle est intervenue, et ce ant\u00e9rieurement et aux fins de l'acte de vente en question. Ce n'est donc pas l'art. 1234 du Code Civil qui s'applique ici mais les dispositions du para. 7 de l'art. 1233 du Code Civil qui permettent la preuve testimoniale lorsqu'il y a un commencement de preuve par \u00e9crit. Dans Johnston v. Buckland[4], le Juge en chef Rinfret, parlant au nom de cette Cour, a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 aux pages 102 et seq. ce qu'il faut entendre par \u00ab commencement de preuve par \u00e9crit \u00bb. II a not\u00e9 particuli\u00e8rement les dispositions de l'art. 316 du Code de Proc\u00e9dure Civile qui autorise la recherche de ce commencement de preuve par \u00e9crit dans le t\u00e9moignage m\u00eame de la partie centre laquelle on cherche \u00e0 faire la preuve testimoniale et il a rappel\u00e9 que cette recherche \u00e9tant du domaine du Juge du fond, les tribunaux d'appel ne doivent pas intervenir dans cette question laiss\u00e9e \u00e0 l'arbitrage du Juge de premi\u00e8re instance sauf dans le cas d'une erreur \u00e9vidente. En l'esp\u00e8ce, ce commencement de preuve par \u00e9crit, M. le Juge Rivard, de la Cour d'Appel, qui a fait une analyse tr\u00e8s d\u00e9taill\u00e9e du dossier, l'a trouv\u00e9, \u00e0 l'instar du Juge de premi\u00e8re instance, dans cet ensemble form\u00e9 (i) de certains aveux faits par Jacques Morin aux plaidoiries et dans son t\u00e9moignage, (ii) de l'appr\u00e9ciation de son t\u00e9moignage au sujet duquel le Juge de premi\u00e8re instance d\u00e9clara: \u00abSes r\u00e9ponses ne viennent qu'apr\u00e8s de longues et laborieuses h\u00e9sitations puis, lorsque les questions pouvaient provoquer une r\u00e9ponse de port\u00e9e juridique d\u00e9favorable \u00e0 sa cause, presque invariablement il d\u00e9clare qu'il ne se souvient pas, sans oser toutefois nier les propos substantiels rapport\u00e9s par les t\u00e9moins\u00bb et enfin (iii) des multiples circonstances r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9es par une preuve \u00e9crite et verbale dont la validit\u00e9 n'est pas en question. II n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle en est arriv\u00e9 le Juge au proc\u00e8s sur la question, opinion que partage enti\u00e8rement M. le Juge Rivard, soit entach\u00e9e d'erreur \u00e9vidente. II n'y a donc pas lieu d'intervenir et il n'appara\u00eet d'ailleurs aucune raison de ce faire.\nSur la force probante. Je ne crois pas qu'il soit n\u00e9cessaire de reproduire ici l'analyse minutieuse de toute la preuve, analyse qui appara\u00eet aux notes de M. le Juge Rivard aussi bien qu'\u00e0 celles du Juge de premi\u00e8re instance. II suffit de dire que la version de Morin p\u00e8re sur la nature de cette entente verbale est support\u00e9e par les faits r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9s au dossier et que suivant cette entente Morin fils devait agir comme pr\u00eate-nom de son p\u00e8re et lui r\u00e9troc\u00e9der, \u00e0 sa demande, les deux propri\u00e9t\u00e9s, Morin p\u00e8re devant de son c\u00f4t\u00e9 et aussit\u00f4t qu'il le pourrait rembourser \u00e0 son fils les argents d\u00e9bours\u00e9s par celui-ci, ses fr\u00e8res et ses s\u0153urs.\nMorin fils n'a donc jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 propri\u00e9taire des deux immeubles en litige. II s'ensuit que son p\u00e8re a droit d'en obtenir la r\u00e9trocession, ce \u00e0 quoi il n'y a aucun obstacle en ce qui concerne la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9sidentielle dont le fils n'a pas dispos\u00e9.\nIl s'ensuit aussi que Morin p\u00e8re a droit de demander\u2014et c'est l\u00e0 le second aspect du litige\u2014que l'acte de vente relatif \u00e0 la ferme, intervenu le 17 novembre 1959, entre son fils et Mar-Mic Farm Inc. soit d\u00e9clar\u00e9 (i) nul, si entach\u00e9 de fraude attribuable \u00e0 Morin fils et \u00e0 Marc-Andr\u00e9 Blouin ou (ii) inexistant, si Mar-Mic Farm Inc. d\u00e9sign\u00e9e comme acheteur n'avait aucune existence juridique \u00e0 la date de cet acte de vente et de son enregistrement et que ce d\u00e9faut n'est pas autrement couvert en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\nLe second de ces moyens \u00e9tant, \u00e0 mon avis, bien fond\u00e9 et d\u00e9cisif de ce second aspect du litige il suffira de ne consid\u00e9rer que ce moyen.\nII est ind\u00e9niable que la date de cet acte de vente entre Jacques Morin et Mar-Mic Farm Inc. est le 17 novembre 1959 alors que la date des lettres patentes accord\u00e9es \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re est le 23 f\u00e9vrier 1960. N'ayant aucune existence l\u00e9gale a la date de cet acte de vente aussi bien qu'a celle de l'enregistrement d'icelui, Mar-Mic Farm Inc. ne peut r\u00e9clamer les b\u00e9n\u00e9fices de la priorit\u00e9 d'enregistrement \u00e0 moins qu'elle ne puisse utilement invoquer, comme en a jug\u00e9 la majorit\u00e9 en Cour d'Appel, certaines dispositions de l'art. 29 de la Loi des Compagnies de Qu\u00e9bec, S.R.Q. 1941, c. 276. Ces dispositions particuli\u00e8res statuent que des la date de ses lettres patentes une compagnie est saisie de tous les biens poss\u00e9d\u00e9s ou d\u00e9tenus pour elle jusqu'\u00e0 cette date en vertu d'un fid\u00e9icommis cr\u00e9\u00e9 en vue de sa constitution en corporation. Pour entrer dans le cadre de ces dispositions Mar-Mic Farm Inc devait all\u00e9guer et prouver qu'ant\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 son incorporation, la ferme en question \u00e9tait poss\u00e9d\u00e9e ou d\u00e9tenue pour elle jusqu'\u00e0 la date de ses lettres patentes en vertu d'un fid\u00e9icommis cr\u00e9\u00e9 en vue de sa constitution en corporation. En d'autres termes, il lui fallait all\u00e9guer et prouver qu'une personne physique ou morale avait acquis un titre l\u00e9gal \u00e0 cette ferme en qualit\u00e9 de fiduciaire et la d\u00e9tenait \u00e0 ce titre pour la lui c\u00e9der d\u00e9s qu'elle aurait acquis une existence l\u00e9gale. II n'y a aucune preuve au dossier de la constitution d'un fid\u00e9icommis au sens et aux fins indiqu\u00e9s \u00e0 ces dispositions de l'art. 29 de la Loi des Compagnies de Qu\u00e9bec. Selon ces termes, l'acte du 17 novembre 1959 n'est pas un acte de vente intervenu entre Morin fils et une personne agissant \u00e8s-qualit\u00e9 de fiduciaire pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de Mar-Mic Farm Inc. mais un acte de vente intervenu entre Morin fils et un acheteur d\u00e9sign\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant Mar-Mic Farm Inc. repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par Jean-Guy Blouin\u2014et non Marc-Andr\u00e9 Blouin\u2014agissant non pas personnellement ou \u00e8s-qualit\u00e9 de fiduciaire mais \u00e0 titre de secr\u00e9taire de la compa- gnie Mar-Mic Farm Inc. II est de l\u2019essence d'un fid\u00e9icommis qu'un titre l\u00e9gal \u00e0 des biens passe d'une personne \u00e0 un fiduciaire qui le d\u00e9tient pour l\u2019avantage du b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire du fid\u00e9icommis. Ni Jean-Guy Blouin ni Marc-Andr\u00e9 Blouin n'apparaissent \u00e0 l'acte comme ayant acquis eux-m\u00eames et \u00e0 quelque titre que ce soit un droit \u00e0 la ferme. En somme comme M. le Juge Rivard je suis d'avis que les dispositions de l\u2019art. 29 de la Loi des Compagnies de Qu\u00e9bec ne peuvent \u00eatre \u00e9tendues au cas qui nous occupe. Ne pouvant invoquer utilement ces dispositions je ne vois pas comment Mar-Mic Farm Inc. pourrait profiter de ce pr\u00e9tendu contrat fait de sa part avant m\u00eame qu'elle ne soit incorpor\u00e9e. Je ne vois davantage comment, apr\u00e8s son incorporation, elle pourrait, par adoption ou ratification, valider r\u00e9troactivement \u00e0 la date qu'il porte, cet acte de vente dont elle n'avait pas au jour o\u00f9 il fut sign\u00e9 la capacit\u00e9 d'autoriser l'ex\u00e9cution.\nReste \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer la pr\u00e9vention de Jacques Morin voulant que m\u00eame si les vues ci-dessus exprim\u00e9es sont bien fond\u00e9es et que c'est en qualit\u00e9 de pr\u00eate-nom de son p\u00e8re, qu'il s'est port\u00e9 acqu\u00e9reur des immeubles en litige, les appelants ne peuvent r\u00e9ussir sur leur action parce que pr\u00e9alablement \u00e0 son institution ils ne Font pas rembours\u00e9 de $4,900, balance due sur la somme de $5,200 avanc\u00e9e par lui et ses fr\u00e8res et s\u0153urs et parce qu'ils n'ont pas vu \u00e0 le faire lib\u00e9rer des obligations qu'il avait contract\u00e9es avec la United Loan Corporation. Pour disposer de cette pr\u00e9vention, il suffit, je crois, de rappeler que suivant la convention verbale intervenue entre Morin p\u00e8re et Morin fils ant\u00e9rieurement et aux fins du contrat par lequel ce dernier se portait acqu\u00e9reur des deux immeubles en litige, Morin fils devait sur simple demande, et sans autre condition, r\u00e9troc\u00e9der ces immeubles \u00e0 son p\u00e8re; sans doute le p\u00e8re s'\u00e9tait-il engag\u00e9 \u00e0 rembourser le fils des argents avances par lui, et ses fr\u00e8res et s\u0153urs, mais suivant la convention le p\u00e8re ne devait rembourser que lorsque la chose lui serait possible. Ainsi donc et en raison de cette entente le droit de Morin p\u00e8re \u00e0 la r\u00e9trocession des immeubles n'est assujetti \u00e0 aucune condition et le fils devait y proc\u00e9der d\u00e9s la demande de son p\u00e8re. On peut ajouter, sans que la chose soit n\u00e9cessaire, qu'en outre des argents contri- bu\u00e9s par lui en paiement du prix de vente fix\u00e9 par les syndics c'est Morin p\u00e8re qui \u00e0 la suite de cette vente a vu au paiement des primes d'assurance, des taxes aussi bien que des versements exig\u00e9s en vertu de l\u2019obligation consentie \u00e0 la United Loan Corporation.\nPour ces raisons, qui sont en substance celles de M. le Juge Rivard, de la Cour d'Appel, et de M. le Juge Marchand, de la Cour de premi\u00e8re instance, je maintiendrais les trois appels et rejetterais le contre-appel, avec d\u00e9pens en cette Cour; j'infirmerais les jugements prononc\u00e9s en Cour d'Appel dans les causes portant les num\u00e9ros 6117, 6118 et 6119 et r\u00e9tablirais le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance avec les modifications indiqu\u00e9es aux raisons de jugement de M. le Juge Rivard.\nAppels maintenus et contre-appel rejet\u00e9.\nProcureurs des appelants: Fradette, Bergeron & Cain, Chicoutimi.\nProcureurs de I'intim\u00e9 Jacques Morin: Lafreni\u00e8re, Cassette, Loubier & Boudreau, Qu\u00e9bec.\nProcureurs des intim\u00e9s Blouin et Mar-Mic Farm Inc.: Pratte, C\u00f4t\u00e9 & Tremblay, Qu\u00e9bec.\n[1] [1964] B.R. 854.\n[2] [1964] B.R. 854.\n[3] [1964] B.R. 854.\n[4] [1937] R.C.S. 86, 2 D.L.R. 433.\n",

Whittell applicable so as to require apportionment of liability between life tenant and those entitled ultimately to the capital\u2014Expressed intention of testator.\nThe issue involved in the present appeal was as to whether or not the rule in Allhusen v. Whittell (1867), L.R. 4 Eq. 295, was applicable in respect of the estate of B L, deceased, so as to require, in respect of the obligations of the estate, including debts, income taxes owed by the deceased, succession duties, interest upon such taxes and duties, and administration expenses, an apportionment of liability as between E L, the widow of the deceased, who became entitled to the income of the estate until her death or remarriage, and those persons who would be entitled ultimately to the capital of the estate. On motion for the construction of the will of B L the trial judge held that the wording of para. (e) thereof excluded the application of the rule to the payment of succession duties. He did apply it, as from the date of death, to debts and expenses. In the case of income tax and interest thereon, he applied the rule as from April 30, 1954, this being the month in which sales of the deceased's stock-in-trade were completed. In the case of administration expenses, he applied the rule as from the date the expenses became payable. In each case the rate of interest used in the application of the rule was the rate actually earned by the estate.\nOn appeal, by a majority of two to one, the Court of Appeal held that the rule applied to all of the above categories of estate liabilities, including succession duties, the determination to be made as from the date of death in each case. It was also held that the amount of duties and taxes, for the purpose of applying the rule, should include the interest and penalties paid thereon. From the judgment of the Court of Appeal E L appealed to this Court. Held: (Cartwright J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.\nPer Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Hall: The will was construed as indicating the intention of the testator that all his debts and the succession duties should be paid by his executors, not out of the general residue of his estate, but out of the ready money of which he was possessed at the time of his death and the cash proceeds of the sale of a limited part of the residue, constituting a part of the capital of the estate. The rule in Allhusen v. Whittell was not applicable because, in view of the provisions contained in this will, the testator did not intend that it should apply. He designated a specified capital fund for the payment of debts and succession duties. The terms of the will displaced the application of the rule. In re Wills, Wills v. Hamilton, [1915] 1 Ch. 769; Re Coulson, [1959] O.R. 156, referred to; Re Darby, Russell v. MacGregor, [1939] 1 Ch. 905, statement of Sir Wilfrid Greene M.R., at p. 916, adopted.\nPer Cartwright J., dissenting: For the reasons given in the judgment of the majority in the Court of Appeal the appeal should be dismissed. By the terms of the will it was the income from what remained after excluding the testator's \"just debts, funeral and testamentary expenses and all probate and succession duties\" that was given to the widow. There was no gift to her of the income derived from the moneys required to make payment of these items.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], dismissing an appeal and allowing a cross-appeal from a judgment of Verchere J. Appeal allowed, Cartwright J. dissenting.\nAllan D. McEachern, for the appellant.\nKenneth C. Binks, Q.C., for the respondent Mary Southin.\nBrian Crane, for the respondent Montreal Trust Company.\nCARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):\u2014The questions to be decided on this appeal, the facts, and the terms of the will of the late Benjamin Lotzkar which are relevant are set out in the reasons of my brother Martland and need not be repeated.\nI have reached the conclusion that the appeal fails. I find myself so fully in agreement with the reasons of Davey J.A. who gave the judgment of the majority in the Court of Appeal that I propose to add only a few words.\nThe gift to the appellant with which we are concerned is contained in cl. (f) of the will which is quoted in full in the reasons of my brother Martland. It is a gift of the net income from \"the residue of the moneys realized from said sale or sales, calling-in or conversion, and any ready money \u2026together with the income from any property which from time to time may remain unsold or unconverted\".\nTo ascertain what is meant by the word \"residue\" which I have italicized, it is necessary to refer to cl. (e) which directs the trustees to sell, call in and convert into money all the remainder of the testator's estate not consisting of money and to pay out of the moneys so realized from such sale and conversion and any ready money that he may be possessed of his \"just debts, funeral and testamentary expenses and all probate and succession duties\". It is the income from what remains after excluding these items that is given to the widow. There is no gift to her of the income derived from the moneys required to make payment of the items specified. The trustees have however paid the income from the whole estate to the widow. I agree with Davey J.A. that the trustees were in error in so doing and also with his direction as to the method of taking the accounts to correct this error.\nHaving already indicated my full agreement with the reasons of Davey J.A. it follows that I would dismiss the appeal, but, in view of the differences of opinion in the Courts below and in this Court, this appears to me to be a proper case in which to direct that the costs as between solicitor and client of all parties who appeared on the appeal in this Court be paid out of the capital of the estate, and I would so order.\nThe judgment of Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Hall JJ. was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014The issue involved in this appeal is as to whether or not the rule in Allhusen v. Whittell[2], is applicable in respect of the estate of Benjamin Lotzkar, deceased, so as to require, in respect of the obligations of the estate, including debts, income taxes owed by the deceased, succession duties, interest upon such taxes and duties, and administration expenses, an apportionment of liability as between Etta Lotzkar, the widow of the deceased, who became entitled to the income of the estate until her death or remarriage, and those persons who would be entitled ultimately to the capital of the estate.\nBenjamin Lotzkar, hereinafter referred to as \"the testator\", carried on business in the City of Vancouver, as a dealer in junk. His business was still in operation at the time of his death on July 7, 1951. He was married, and had six daughters, of whom, at the time of his death, the two eldest were married, and the three youngest were infants, the youngest then being aged eleven years. The four unmarried daughters subsequently married. At present all the daughters are living and none is an infant.\nThe beneficiaries under the testator's will consisted solely of his wife and daughters, with certain contingent interests for the issue of the four youngest daughters.\nThe main provisions of the will, which was made on September 2, 1948, are summarized, or quoted, as follows:\nAll of the testator's property was devised and bequeathed to his executors, Montreal Trust Company, his wife, and his brother Leon, as trustees upon the trusts contained in the will.\nParagraph (a) provided for delivery to the testator's wife of all furniture and household effects, automobile, and articles of personal, household, or domestic use or ornament.\nParagraph (b) permitted his wife to use his residence during her lifetime or until remarriage, all taxes, insurance and water rates and reasonable repairs to be paid from the estate. Provision was made for the use of the house by unmarried children after the wife's death or remarriage.\nParagraph (c) directed the Trustees:\n(c) To receive the income from my junk business carried on after my death by the manager thereof, pursuant to the authority herein given in respect thereof, or such portion of the income as the manager shall not require for the operation of the business, and also the proceeds of the sale of the said business when the same has been sold by the manager pursuant to the authority hereinafter set forth.\nThis paragraph must be read in conjunction with a later paragraph in the will, reading as follows:\nI DO HEREBY APPOINT my said brother and my wife, or the survivor of them, to carry on my junk business for a period of one year after my death, with a view of selling the same; but no junk or other stock shall be bought after my death. My said brother and my wife, or the survivor of them, herein referred to as the manager, shall be accountable to the Trustees of my estate in respect to the income therefrom, and the proceeds of the sale of the said business; and the manager shall operate the business for such period and shall sell the said business SUBJECT to the direction and control of my Trustees or a majority of them. My said manager shall quarterly from the date of my death account for and pay over to the Trustees all income in respect of the said business, but not so as to impair the funds required to operate the said business; and forthwith after the sale of the said business the manager shall render an account thereof to the Trustees, and the sale price thereof shall be paid to the Trustees and form part of the capital of my estate to be dealt with as herein provided. My Trustees are authorized to pay to my wife and my said brother as remuneration while engaged in carrying on my said business as herein provided the sum of ONE HUNDRED ($100.00) DOLLARS monthly to each of them.\nParagraph (d) related to a business block owned by the testator. The Trustees were directed to stand possessed of this property for ten years following his death, after which it might be sold. The Trustees were to lease the premises upon monthly tenancies. The income thus derived was to be used for payment of taxes, insurance, water rates, carrying charges and necessary repairs, the balance to be subject to \"the same trust as hereinafter provided in respect of the income from the remainder of my estate.\"\nParagraphs (e) and (f) read as follows:\n(e) SAVE as herein otherwise expressly provided, to sell, call in and convert into money all the remainder of my estate not consisting of money at such time or times, in such manner, and upon such terms as my said Trustees in their direction may decide upon, with the power and discretion to postpone such conversion of such estate or any part or parts thereof for such length of time as they may think best; and I HEREBY DECLARE that my said Trustees may retain any portion of my estate in the form in which it may be at my death, and to pay out of the moneys so realized from such sale and conversion and any ready money that I may be possessed of, my just debts, funeral and testamentary expenses and all probate and succession duties that may be payable in connection with any insurance or gift or benefit given by me to any person either in my lifetime or by this will or any codicil thereto; such duties to be paid out of the capital of my estate so that any benefit, other than in respect of the residue, passing to any beneficiary shall accrue to such beneficiary without any deduction whatsoever for probate or succession duties.\n(f) To keep the residue of the moneys realized from said sale or sales, calling-in or conversion, and any ready money, invested in securities of, or guaranteed by the Dominion of Canada; and to pay the net income therefrom, together with the income from any property which from time to time may remain unsold or unconverted, to my said wife in monthly instalments during her lifetime or so long as she shall remain my widow, and in the event of the death or remarriage of my wife during the infancy of any of my children, I DIRECT that my Trustees shall apply the income from my estate for the support, maintenance, education and advancement of my infant children, and in the event of this being insufficient for these purposes, or in the event of the illness of my wife or after the death or remarriage of my wife, in the event of the illness of any child or the child of any deceased child of mine, referred to in paragraph (g) (V) hereof, or for any other reason my Trustees deem advisable, I EMPOWER my Trustees in their sole discretion to encroach on the capital of my estate to such extent as they consider necessary and proper, including the capital of the presumptive share of any child of mine.\nThe next following paragraphs contain provisions as to what is to occur following the death or remarriage of the wife.\nTwo annuities were to be purchased, one for each of the two eldest daughters. The amount to be expended for each was five per centum (5%) of the value of the estate at the time of the wife's death or remarriage.\nIncome from the residuary estate was to be applied for the maintenance, advancement and education of the other four daughters. As each one attained the age of twenty-one years she was to receive a Dominion of Canada annuity, guaranteed for twenty years, paying annually the sum of $1,200.\nThe residue of the estate was to be divided, when the testator's youngest living child attained the age of twenty-one years, into four equal shares, one such share for each of the four daughters. Each was to receive the income from her share, with one-quarter of the capital to be received at the age of thirty years, one-quarter at age thirty-five and the balance at age forty. This clause concluded with the following proviso:\nPROVIDED that should any one or more of my said children die before receiving the whole or any part of her said share, the same shall be distributed per stirpes amongst the survivors of the said four children or their issue at such time or times as she would have received distribution had she lived to attain the ages herein mentioned.\nThe first succession duty return, dated October 25, 1951, disclosed the gross value of the estate at $609,594.77, of which the major items were:\nReal Estate\n$ 145,350.00\nBonds\n30,975.97\nCash\n339,100.49\nStock-in-trade\n70,750.00\nDebts were shown as $28,170.25, leaving a net estate of $581,424.52.\nAfter appraisals had been made of the stock-in-trade, a revised return, filed on January 30, 1952, disclosed a gross estate of $778,230.18, with debts of $163,186.24, showing a net value of $625,043.94. The value of the stock-in-trade was shown at $208,862. At the insistence of Mrs. Lotzkar, instead of selling the stock-in-trade in bulk, it was sold piece-meal over a period of time, up to April 1954, and ultimately realized a net amount of $1,034,678.17.\nIn June 1956, income tax was assessed for the years 1943 to 1951 totalling $727,639.14. This was paid out of capital and an appeal filed. Counsel retained by Mrs. Lotzkar undertook the carriage of this matter, with the Trustees' consent, and ultimately a refund was obtained of $419,-807.93 and interest in the sum of $2,294.79.\nA large part of the refund was applied in settlement of succession duties. Ultimately the amounts paid for income tax and succession duties were:\nIncome Tax\n$388,508.54\nInterest\n58,274.12\n$446,782.66\nSuccession Duties\n$417,657.09\nInterest\n41,890.42\n459,547.51\n$906,330.17\nDuring the period from the testator's death until October 31, 1961, the net income of the estate (other than $30,451.76) was paid to Mrs. Lotzkar, and totalled $405,946.80, on which income she paid tax.\nFollowing this, Montreal Trust Company applied by originating notice, returnable on January 9, 1962, later amended, for advice and directions in the form of five questions submitted to the Court. Only the first four of these are now relevant:\n1. Are the Succession Duties, Probate Fees, just debts, funeral and testamentary expenses of the said deceased and of the estate of the said deceased payable out of the capital only of the said estate to the exclusion of the earnings of the money used to pay debts?\n2. Is the total amount of interest charged upon the said Succession Duties, Probate Fees and said debts payable out of the capital only of the said estate to the exclusion of the earnings of the money used to pay debts?\n3. Is the total net income of the estate of the said deceased, apart from the specific bequests in Paragraphs (a) and (b) on Page One of the said Will, which has been received by the Executors and Trustees from time to time since the date of death of the said deceased, payable to the widow of the said deceased, namely, ETA LOTZKAR, until her death or remarriage?\n4. If the answer to any of the above questions is in the negative then what, if any, equitable rule of apportionment should be applied in each such case as between the beneficiaries of the income and the beneficiaries of the capital of the said estate? All of the testator's daughters supported the position of the widow, contending that each of the first three questions should be answered in the affirmative. Counsel appointed to represent issue of the testator's daughters, born or unborn, who might, contingently, acquire an interest in the estate, opposed this position.\nThe issue raised by the first three questions is as to whether the rule in Allhusen v. Whittell is applicable in respect of the items of expenditure mentioned in the first two questions. That case, which was decided almost a hundred years ago, related to a will, by whose terms certain legacies were bequeathed, and which devised and bequeathed the residue of the estate, after payment of debts, funeral and testamentary expenses, to trustees upon trust to sell and convert and to invest the clear moneys, after payment of all incidental expenses, in specified investments. The income was to be paid to a life tenant, and, thereafter, the residue was to be divided among certain relatives of the testator.\nThe rule is stated by the Vice-Chancellor, Sir W. Page Wood, as follows:\nThere appear to be two points well covered by authority. One is, that every tenant for life of residue is entitled to the income of all such part of the residue as is not required for the payment of debts, and which is found to be in a proper state of investment. He is entitled to the income of that property from the death of the testator. There have been numerous decisions on this point, some of the earliest being those of Angerstein v. Martin, T. & R. 232, and Hewitt v. Morris, T. & R. 241. These authorities clearly shew that, supposing a testator has a large sum, say \u00a350,000 or \u00a360,000, in the funds, and has only \u00a310,000 worth of debts, the executors will be justified, as between themselves and the whole body of persons interested in the estate, in dealing with it as they think best in the administration. But the executors, when they have dealt with the estate, will be taken by the Court as having applied in payment of debts such a portion of the fund as, together with the income of that portion for one year, was necessary for the payment of the debts. It is curious that I find none of the authorities pointing out this rule, but probably it has never been thought necessary to make so nice a distinction. It is quite clear that the executors must not be taken to have applied the whole income. Until the debts and legacies were paid, there would have been no interest from the death of the testator which could by possibility have come to the tenant for life. What I apprehend to be the true principle is, that, in the bookkeeping which the Court enters upon for the purpose of adjusting the rights between the parties, it is necessary to ascertain what part, together with the income of such part for a year, will be wanted for the payment of debts, legacies, and other charges, during the year; and the proper and necessary fund must be ascertained by including the income for one year which may arise upon the fund which may be so wanted. I have not been able to find a case in which that calculation has been made, but it appears to me to be the principle upon which alone the rights can be adjusted. It is clear that the tenant for life ought not to have the income arising from what is wanted for the payment of debts, because that never becomes residue in any way whatever.\nThe case is concerned with the adjustment of rights and liabilities, as between the life tenant and the remainderman of the residue of an estate during the \"executor's year\". Two matters are covered in this statement. The first is as to the right of the tenant for life to the income of that part of the residue not required for the payment of debts, which is in a proper state of investment. That right is to receive such income as from the date of death. The executors are not entitled during the one-year period from the date of death, as between him and the remainderman to apply that income in the payment of debts.\nThe second is that, in determining the portion of the residue required to meet the debts, the executors are to determine that amount which, together with interest on it for the one-year period, would pay the debts. On that portion of the residue the life tenant is not entitled to income, because that portion never becomes residue.\nIn essence, in doing the bookkeeping as between life tenant and remainderman the executors are required to set aside out of capital a fund which, applying the principles above stated, will provide for payment of the estate debts. This is done on the assumption that it is the intention of the deceased to do so. However, this must be subject to the specific directions of the testator who might, in his will, himself designate that fund which is to be applied for the payment of debts.\nIn the case of In re Wills, Wills v. Hamilton[3], Sargant J. held that the principle was not limited to payments made during the first year from the testator's death, but applied equally to payments made during the subsequent years. In that case he also held that the interest payable on estate duty should be included with the duty itself as being a debt to be discharged.\nThere has been a number of decisions regarding the applicability of the rule, many of which are reviewed in the judgment of Wells J. in Re Coulson[4]. I do not propose to recite them here. In none of them was the wording of the will the same as in the present case. The question to be decided is as to whether the rule applies in respect of this will, and, in that connection, I adopt the statement of Sir Wilfrid Greene M.R. in Re Darby, Russell v. MacGregor[5], at p. 916:\nThe rule in Allhusen v. Whittell, like so many other rules which the Court of equity has adopted, is for the purpose of giving effect to an equitable arrangement which the testator may be presumed to have intended in making the dispositions which he did make. It can be displaced by any language of the will which sufficiently shows an intention to displace it and, in my opinion, it also ceases to be applicable where the nature of the property concerned or the circumstances affecting it are such as to make it impossible to apply the rule as it ought to be applied.\nIn the present case, the learned trial judge held that the wording of para. (e) of the will excluded the application of the rule to the payment of succession duties. He did apply it, as from the date of death, to debts and expenses. In the case of income tax and interest thereon, he applied the rule as from April 30, 1954, this being the month in which the sales of the stock-in-trade were completed. In the case of administration expenses, he applied the rule as from the date the expenses became payable. In each case the rate of interest used in the application of the rule was the rate actually earned by the estate.\nOn appeal, by a majority of two to one, the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[6] held that the rule applied to all of the above categories of estate liabilities, including succession duties, the determination to be made as from the date of death, in each case. It was also held that the amount of duties and taxes, for the purpose of applying the rule, should include the interest and penalties paid thereon.\nSheppard J.A. dissented, holding that the terms of the will displaced the application of the rule.\nFrom the judgment of the Court of Appeal Mrs. Lotzkar has brought the present appeal.\nIn my opinion the rule is not applicable in the present case because, in view of the provisions contained in this will, the testator did not intend that it should apply.\nThe general intent of the whole will was to make provision for the testator's wife and daughters, with provision for the issue of daughters only if a daughter entitled to a share in the capital of the residue died before attaining the stipulated ages at which her share of the capital would be payable. The wife was to receive furniture and personal effects outright, plus the use of the family residence and the income of the estate until her death or remarriage. Following that event the two eldest daughters were to receive annuities, while the income from the residue was to be applied for the benefit of the other daughters until the youngest attained the age of twenty-one years, with provision for each one receiving an annuity on attaining that age. None of the four younger daughters was to receive any part of the capital of the residue until she attained the age of thirty years. The whole emphasis is clearly placed on the provision of income for the testator's wife and daughters.\nThis is not a straightforward case of granting income of the residuary estate to a life tenant, with a gift of capital following the death of the life tenant, after providing for debts and legacies. Here there were no legacies, and the source of payment for the debts was specifically designated by the testator. The major portion of this estate was the stock-in-trade of the junk business. As to this, special provision was made. It was to be operated by the testator's wife and brother with a view to sale. Income of the business was only to be turned over to the Trustees provided that the funds required to operate the business were not impaired. The sale of the business was to be effected by the wife and the brother, subject to the direction and control of the majority of the Trustees. The wife and brother constituted such majority. As previously noted, the sale of the stock-in-trade of the business was not completed until April 1954.\nThe net income of the business block, which block was required to be retained for ten years, was to be applied on the same trust as provided in respect of the income from the remainder of the estate. I take this to mean that this income is to be applied as provided in para. (f), \"remainder\" meaning what remained of the capital mentioned in para. (e) after payment of debts and succession duties.\nIt should be noted that the provision in the will respecting payment of debts and succession duties was made subordinate to those provisions which related to the testator's business and the business block. Paragraph (e) commences with the words \"Save as herein otherwise expressly provided\".\nThe effect of this proviso, coupled with the provisions relating to the operation of, income from and sale of the business and the provisions of para. (d) relating to the business block, was:\n1. To limit the wife's right to receive income from the operation of the business to such portion of it as was not required for the operation of the business.\n2. To preclude the sale of the business block for a period of ten years.\n3. To direct payment of the net income derived from the business block in full to the wife.\n4. To make the estate assets other than the business and the business block primarily responsible for the payment of debts and succession duties.\nPayment of debts and succession duties is directed to be made out of those assets which are sold by the Trustees and converted into money and out of ready money of which the testator was possessed. Paragraph (e) in terms directs such payment \"out of the moneys so realized from such sale and conversion\", that is, out of the cash obtained from sale of those estate assets which the Trustees were authorized to sell, and out of ready money, which would include cash and bank accounts of the testator at the time he died. This description of the funds to be applied for such payment is of cash capital of the estate, derived from certain sources not comprising the whole of the residue of the estate. The testator designated a specified capital fund for the payment of debts and succession duties.\nThis view is reinforced by the wording of para. (f), relating to investment and income. The investments to be made by the Trustees to provide income are to be made out of \"the residue of the moneys realized from said sale or sales, calling-in or conversion and any ready money\", i.e., what is left from the ready money and cash realized from the sale and conversion of the specified assets, after payment of debts and succession duties. The wife is to receive the income from those investments plus income from property not sold or converted.\nIt is further reinforced by the concluding words of para. (e):\nsuch duties to be paid out of the capital of my estate so that any benefit, other than in respect of the residue, passing to any beneficiary shall accrue to such beneficiary without any deduction whatsoever for probate or succession duties. The purpose of this proviso, as indicated in the reasons of Davey J.A. in the Court below, was to exempt beneficiaries, other than in respect of the residue, from the liability for payment of succession duties in respect of the benefits which they received. In order to accomplish that particular purpose, however, it was not necessary to direct payment of such duties \"out of the capital of my estate.\" It would have been sufficient to direct that such benefits be received free of any liability for the payment of succession duties.\nThe direction to pay succession duties and the description of the source of the funds for their payment are contained in the earlier part of para. (e). In my opinion, when the words \"out of the capital of my estate\" were used they refer back to that source of payment. To paraphrase, the testator is saying, at the conclusion of para. (e), that the succession duties, which are payable out of capital, shall, in respect of certain beneficiaries, be so paid that those beneficiaries shall not be liable for payment of them.\nIn other words, the reference to capital in respect of the succession duties, which are payable in exactly the same way, and from the same sources, as other debts, to me confirms the intention of the testator that all the estate liabilities were to be paid out of capital. They do not indicate that succession duties, as to source of payment, were to be treated in a separate category, distinct from estate debts.\nTo summarize, I construe this will as indicating the intention of the testator that all his debts and the succession duties should be paid by his executors, not out of the general residue of his estate, but out of the ready money of which he was possessed at the time of his death and the cash proceeds of the sale of a limited part of the residue, constituting a part of the capital of the estate.\nIn my opinion, for the foregoing reasons, the testator did not intend the rule in Allhusen v. Whittell to apply and displaced its operation.\nNo issue has been raised before us as to the propriety of the conclusion reached in the Courts below that interest payable in respect of income tax should be considered as a part of a total debt for income tax, and similarly with respect to interest in respect of succession duties.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be allowed, and each of the first three questions stated in the originating notice should be answered in the affirmative; consequently, no answer to question 4 is required. The costs of those parties who appeared before us should be payable out of the capital of the estate, those of Montreal Trust Company to be taxed on a solicitor and client basis.\nAppeal allowed, CARTWRIGHT J. dissenting.\nEDITORIAL NOTE:\u2014A motion to vary the judgment in this appeal to provide that the costs of all parties who appeared before this Court be paid out of the capital of the estate on a solicitor and client basis was granted on December 2, 1965.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Russell & DuMoulin, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the respondent Mary Southin: Ladner, Southin and Roberts, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the respondent Montreal Trust Company: Campney, Owen and Murphy, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the respondent Leon Lotzkar: Bull, Housser and Tupper, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the respondents Eva Goldberg, Branna James, Ruth Becker, Helen Lamer, Dolly Van Holtum and Cecil Slanz: Farris, Farris, Vaughan, Taggart, Wills and Murphy, Vancouver.\n[1] (1965), 50 D.L.R.

The Tariff Board found that these rock bolts were not exempt from sales tax under Schedule III of the Excise Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 100, as \"safety devices and equipment for the prevention of accidents in the manufacturing or production of goods\". The Exchequer Court reversed this finding and ruled that the bolts were exempt from sales tax. The Crown appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Cartwright J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.\nPer Taschereau C.J. and Abbott, Ritchie and Spence JJ.: The purpose for which the rock bolts were designed and used was the retention of the contour of the underground cavity and, therefore, the making possible of mining. Devices designed to accomplish that purpose are not devices or equipment \"for the prevention of accidents in the manufacturing or production of goods\" but are simply devices to permit the manufacture or production of goods. These rock bolts were essentially structural devices and not safety devices and, consequently, not exempt from sales tax.\nPer Cartwright J., dissenting: As rightly found by the Exchequer Court, the rock bolts were covered by the exemption in Schedule III of the Excise Tax Act.\nRevenu\u2014Taxe de vente\u2014Exemption\u2014Boulons utilis\u00e9s dans les op\u00e9rations mini\u00e8res pour supporter les plafonds et les murs\u2014Sont-ils exempts de la taxe de vente comme \u00e9tant des dispositifs de s\u00e9curit\u00e9\u2014Loi sur la taxe d'accise, S.R.C. 1952, c. 100, arts. 30, 32, Annexe III.\nLes intim\u00e9s utilisaient des boulons (rock bolts) dans leur op\u00e9rations mini\u00e8res pour retenir en position les murs et les plafonds des puits ou des galeries de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 permettre l'extraction du minerai.

Appel maintenu, le Juge Cartwright \u00e9tant dissident.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of No\u00ebl J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada[2], reversing a decision of the Tariff Board. Appeal allowed, Cartwright J. dissenting.\nG. W. Ainslie and D.G.H. Bowman, for the appellant.\nG. F. Henderson, Q.C., and J. D. Richard, for the respondent Consolidated Denison Mines Ltd.\nStewart Thom, Q.C., and J. D. Goodwin, for the respondent Rio Tinto Mining Co.\nThe judgment of Taschereau C.J. and of Abbott, Ritchie and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nSPENCE J.:\u2014This is an appeal by the Deputy Minister from the decision of No\u00ebl J. in the Exchequer Court[3] in which he found that an item known as a \"rock bolt\" was covered by the exemption in Schedule 3 of the Excise Tax Act and, therefore, not liable for consumption or sales tax. For this purpose, it is sufficient to quote Schedule 3 as it appears in the reasons for judgment of the Tariff Board:\nPROCESSING MATERIALS\nMaterials consumed or expended directly in the process of manufacture or production of goods.\nSecondly:\nMACHINERY AND APPARATUS TO BE USED IN MANUFACTURE OR PRODUCTION\nMachinery and apparatus that, in the opinion of the Minister, are to be used directly in the process of manufacture or production of goods, and the following machinery or apparatus:\n***\nSafety devices and equipment for the prevention of accidents in the manufacturing or production of goods.\nI deal first with the submission of counsel for the appellant, the Deputy Minister, that a \"rock bolt\" is not \"machinery or apparatus\" and that it is not a \"device\". I adopt the reasons of No\u00ebl J. that the rock bolt is a piece of \"apparatus\" and is a \"device\" and I find it unnecessary to decide whether it is a piece of \"machinery\". Therefore, there remains to be determined whether the rock bolt is a \"safety device and equipment for the prevention of accidents in the manufacturing or production of goods\" (the underlining is to indicate the questions left to be considered). No\u00ebl J. said:\nIt seems to me that the proper way to interpret this exemption clause is to take it, not piece-meal, but in its entirety and when that is done it appears that the safety device or equipment which must also be either machinery or apparatus, is directed at those accidental happenings which are peculiar to the industry or manufacture involved due to the existence of some distinctive important hazard particular to the process of manufacture or production involved.\nIt was urged upon this Court that the approach used by the learned Exchequer Court Judge was the one which should be adopted in order to reach the proper interpretation of the words for the determination of the exemption in question. I adopt that submission and turn to consider the \"happenings which are peculiar to the industry or manufacture involved\".\nTo simplify a description of mining, and certainly the simplification would shock those engaged in the industry, it is the delving of a hole in the ground until an ore body is reached and then the removal of that ore or other substance, such as salt, from the hole so delved. It is, of course, as has been stressed in both the declaration of the Tariff Board and the reasons of No\u00ebl J., a fact of nature that a hole will not continue to be a hole unless protected and that nature operates to close all holes under its surface. Therefore, there can be no mine, no removal of ore, and even no hole from which to remove it unless the limits of the hole are in some manner efficiently retained. For many centuries, that end was attained by the use of some kind of wooden timber and the words \"pit props\" were ordinary in the language. Later, the science of mining developed so that other means were used for the same end, and we have had reference to steel framing or arching, cement retaining structures, and rock bolts. All of those means are utilized for retaining in position the walls of a shaft or tunnel and so permitting the ore to be removed therefrom. Now, of course, this entails the protection of those persons who are carrying on the mining, and the retaining of the walls and roofs of the shafts and tunnels protects them in a fashion which makes their labour possible. But even if no human ever entered the shaft or the tunnel there would still have to be some method of retaining such shaft or tunnel in its position in order to remove the ore. Devices which are designed to accomplish that purpose are not devices or equipment \"for the prevention of accidents in the manufacturing or production of goods\" but are simply devices to permit the manufacture or production of goods. I am, therefore, of the opinion that the definition was not intended by Parliament to include such devices. The word \"safety\" together with the words \"for (i.e. with the purpose of) the prevention of accidents in the manufacturing or production of goods\" imply that the purpose for which the device is designed and used is to prevent such accidents, while the purpose for which the rock bolt is designed and used is the retention of the contour of the underground cavity and, therefore, the making possible of mining which, of course, can only be possible if the formation of the cavity is retained and men can work safely therein. Therefore, I agree with the finding of the Tariff Board that these rock bolts were \"essentially structural devices and not safety devices\".\nI would allow the appeal with costs.\nCARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):\u2014The questions to be decided in this appeal are stated in the reasons of my brother Spence. After a consideration of the record in the light of the full and helpful arguments of counsel I find myself so fully in agreement with the reasons and conclusion of No\u00ebl J. that I am content simply to adopt them. At the risk of repeating what he has already said, I am of opinion that, in view of the findings of fact made by the Tariff Board and accepted by No\u00ebl J., the submission of the appellant as to the proper construction of the relevant words of the exempting clause necessitates the addition to that clause of words which it does not contain. It is sought to construe it as if it read:\nSafety devices and equipment used solely for the prevention of accidents in the manufacturing or production of goods.\nThe words which I have italicized do not appear in the exempting clause and for the reasons given by No\u00ebl J. I agree that this is not a case in which the Court can add those words or words similar thereto.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs, CARTWRIGHT J. dissenting.\nSolicitor for the appellant: E.

Bank of Nova Scotia, [1966] S.C.R. 83\nDate: 1965-11-09\nMaurice F. Hurly and The Toronto Dominion Bank (Plaintiffs) Appellants;\nand\nThe Bank of Nova Scotia (Defendant) Respondent;\nand\nLawrence Dunkley (Defendant).\n1965: October 12, 13; 1965: November 9.\nPresent: Abbott, Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Hall JJ\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA, APPELLATE DIVISION\nBanks and banking\u2014Sale of cattle subject to bank's security\u2014Proceeds of sale deposited in debtor's account\u2014Failure of bank's claim\u2014Bank Act, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 48, s. 88.\nThe appellant H and the respondent bank were in contest over the distribution of a fund of $59,311.48, which was in court on a sheriff's interpleader and came from the sale of approximately 400 head of cattle. H claimed the first $45,633.01. The balance was not enough to pay the bank's claim. The Courts below directed a pro rata distribution of the fund which gave H 171\/390ths and the bank 219\/390ths. H founded his claim on ownership of a certain number of the cattle. The bank's claim was under s. 88 of the Bank Act, 1953\u201454 (Can.), c. 48, on security taken from its customer D.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nThe bank knew that its customer, from whom it had taken s. 88 security, had sold the cattle in question to H, had taken a cheque for this sale and had deposited that cheque in his account. The bank could not take the money, the proceeds of the sale, and at the same time say to a purchaser who had bought the herd that the herd was still subject to its security. By taking the money it consented to the sale. The herd then belonged to H and when it was sold on the market, he was entitled to the proceeds.\nThis dealing between D and H was not a mortgage transaction. It was an outright sale to H for immediate cash and a purchase back for a slightly higher consideration with this purchase price to be paid only when the herd was sold. In the meantime, H reserved the title.\nThe bank had no claim to the herd under its s. 88 security. But, in any event, the bank was bound by the terms of a subsequent agreement made by D, H and itself. The contention that this agreement was not binding on the bank because it was never carried out according to its exact terms failed. Under the agreement alone, H was entitled to priority to the extent of the indebtedness recited in the agreement. APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division[1], dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Primrose J. Appeal allowed.\nG. H. Steer, Q.C., for the plaintiffs, appellants.\nJ. M. Robertson, Q.C., for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014Maurice F. Hurly and the Bank of Nova Scotia are in contest here over the distribution of a fund of $59,311.48, which is now in court on a sheriff's interpleader and comes from the sale of approximately 400 head of cattle. Hurly claims the first $45,633.01. The balance is not enough to pay the bank's claim. Up to this point the Alberta Courts have directed a pro rata distribution of the fund which gives Hurly 171\/390ths and the bank 219\/ 390ths. Hurly founds his claim on ownership of a certain number of the cattle. The bank's claim is under s. 88 of the Bank Act, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 48, on security taken from its customer Lawrence Dunkley.\nDunkley was in business as a licensed livestock dealer and cattle feeder near Grande Prairie, Alberta. From 1961 to March of 1963, he had extensive business dealings with Hurly, who was also a licensed livestock dealer. The course of these dealings was that Hurly would acquire cattle for feeding and sell them to Dunkley. Dunkley would feed the cattle for a certain period and then sell them for beef. In almost all cases these sales were made through Hurly. When Hurly acquired cattle which he sold to Dunkley, he would deliver an invoice setting out the number of cattle and their cost to him. To that cost was added 50 cents per cwt. and interest at 6 per cent for the stated period of the feeding. Dunkley would then give to Hurly a post-dated cheque payable at the end of the feeding period. When the cattle were sold the proceeds were sent to Dunkley, who would deposit the money in his account with the Bank of Nova Scotia. Hurly would then present his post-dated cheque for payment. In all these dealings Hurly reserved the title to the cattle and there is no question raised either by the bank or Dunkley that this was not an effective reservation of title. To the extent that the fund of $59,311.48 represents the proceeds from the sale of cattle, which at the time when the trouble came were in the possession of Dunkley on these terms, Hurly's right is not disputed and no more needs to be said about this aspect of the case.\nThe dispute is over an item of $15,390 and a herd of 86 steers. The dealings between Dunkley and Hurly concerning this herd were different from those just outlined. In the first place, it was Dunkley himself who bought this herd. His previous course of dealing had been to buy from Hurly. Hurly was not anxious to see Dunkley go into this deal. However, Dunkley bought on his own and then wanted to sell them to Hurly and buy them back on the same terms as were embodied in the previous agreements, namely, a reservation of title in Hurly and a post-dated cheque to be presented at the date when the cattle were sold. Pursuant to this arrangement, Hurly did buy this herd of 86 steers, which will be referred to as the \"Ross herd\", and gave Dunkley his cheque for $14,752. Dunkley deposited this in his account in the Bank of Nova Scotia on February 6, 1963. Hurly then had second thoughts about the matter and stopped payment of the cheque, but, on February 13, 1963, he decided to go on and gave Dunkley another cheque, which replaced the first cheque, for $14,444.63. This also was deposited by Dunkley in his account and the first cheque was charged back. Therefore, as between Dunkley and Hurly at this time the position was that Hurly owned the Ross herd and had paid cash for it. The herd was in the possession of Dunkley where it had been since its acquisition from Ross. The bank knew the precise deal between Dunkley and Hurly, certainly on February 13 when the second cheque was deposited, and possibly on February 6 when the first cheque was deposited. The bank also had precise knowledge of the previous course of dealing between the two men. The terms of the deal between Dunkley and Hurly concerning the Ross herd are set out in the following agreement, which is in the same terms as the previous agreements:\nThese above steers are branded 44 BAR on the left rib. These above steers are to be branded LAZY H7 on the right hip. Post-dated cheque dated June 5, 1963 received for the above amount of $15,390.00. The above steers remain the property of M. F. Hurly until post-dated cheque received is cleared through the bank. The proceeds of the sale of this herd form part of the fund now in court and Hurly claims them because he was the owner. The bank says that this herd came under its s. 88 security.\nThe bank knew that their customer, from whom they had taken s. 88 security, had sold the Ross herd to Hurly, had taken a cheque for this sale and had deposited that cheque in his account. It has been admitted all through the case that when Dunkley acquired this herd from Ross it did become subject to the bank's s. 88 security. But how can the bank, knowing that the cheque deposited on February 13 was for the purchase price of that herd, take the money and say that the herd is still subject to its s. 88 security? The bank had to take a position with respect to this particular herd on either February 6 or February 13. It could have said to its customer, \"You had no right to sell this herd without our consent. We will not take the money and we will enforce our rights on the herd.\" But it could not take the money, the proceeds of the sale, and at the same time say to a purchaser who had bought the herd that the herd was still subject to its security. By taking the money it consented to the sale. The herd then belonged to Hurly and when it was sold on the market, he was entitled to the proceeds.\nThe Appellate Division has characterized this dealing between Dunkley and Hurly concerning the Ross herd as a mortgage transaction. In other words, while the herd in Dunkley's hands was subject to the s. 88 security, he mortgaged it to Hurly, who must take subject to the prior security. I do not see this as a mortgage transaction. It was an outright sale to Hurly for immediate cash and a purchase back for a slightly higher consideration with this purchase price to be paid only when the herd was sold. In the meantime, Hurly reserved the title. It is true that at all times possession was in Dunkley but throughout the whole course of this litigation no one has asserted a right to avoid any of the transactions between Hurly and Dunkley for non-compliance with legislation relating to bills of sale and chattel mortgages or conditional sales. The case has been presented and argued throughout on this basis. Whether it could have been done otherwise, I do not know. It is, however, clear that when the bank came to make the agreement with Dunkley and Hurley, which I deal with next, it recognized that the relationship between these two in their dealings with the Ross herd was that of vendor and purchaser, that the title was in Hurly and that it held no security on the herd.\nLater in February, 1963, it became evident that Dunkley was in difficulty. On February 26, 1963, Dunkley, Hurly and the bank made an agreement. This agreement recites that Dunkley owes Hurly $45,631.01; that he owes the bank $30,000; that he is in possession of approximately 400 head of cattle and that the bank and Hurly have the right to seize these cattle and sell them to satisfy the indebtedness.\nThen the parties agree as follows:\n1. The party of the first part (Dunkley) shall have from the date hereof to five o'clock in the afternoon of the 1st day of March, A.D. 1963 in which to repay to the party of the second part and the party of the third part the indebtedness as above set out.\n2. In the event that the party of the first part (Dunkley) has not, at the expiration of the time limited herein, repaid his said indebtedness, the parties of the first and second parts (Dunkley and Hurly) hereby agree to sell the said cattle above set out, crediting all sums received from the said sale to the satisfaction of the said indebtedness. The said sale shall commence at five o'clock in the afternoon of the 1st day of March, A.D. 1963.\n3. The said sale shall be under the joint direction of the party of the first part and the party of the second part (Dunkley and Hurly), but in the event that the said parties cannot agree as to the sale price of any or all of the said cattle, the said cattle shall then be consigned to Messrs. Weiller and Williams, Livestock Commission Agents, Western Stockyards, Edmonton, Alberta, for sale by Public Auction.\n4. The party of the second part (Hurly) shall deduct from the proceeds of the sale such monies that are owing to him, and he shall thereafter remit the balance of all monies received from the said sale to the Bank of Nova Scotia at its Grande Prairie branch.\n5. All sums received by the party of the second part (Hurly) pursuant to this Agreement, shall be credited on the Agreements for Sale of the cattle and the postdated cheques held by him from the party of the first part.\nWhen this agreement was executed, the bank knew that Hurly owned the Ross herd and recognized that ownership by including in Hurly's claim of $45,631.01 the $15,390 owing for the Ross herd.\nThe bank now says that this agreement is not binding on it because it was never carried out according to its exact terms. What happened was this: Hurly and Dunkley could not agree on the sale of the cattle. On March 1, the bank made a seizure of all the cattle. After the seizure had been made, Dunkley, Hurly and the bank manager met and arranged that the cattle would be shipped to Edmonton and sold through Messrs. Weiller and Williams. This was done. The sheriff received the proceeds of the sale, the fund of $59,311.48 already referred to. Then the bank said that because Dunkley and Hurly had been unable to agree and it had become necessary to make a seizure, the agreement was at an end and the bank was free to make a claim on the Ross herd under its s. 88 security.\nI have already dealt with the bank's claim to the Ross herd under its s. 88 security. It had no such claim. But I am equally clear that in any event, the bank is bound by the terms of this agreement, which did not come to an end because the bank chose to seize on March 1. This merely brought matters to a head and was a mode of enforcing performance of the agreement, which was in fact carried out through the designated sale agent with the proceeds paid to the sheriff. In my opinion, under the agreement alone, Hurly is entitled to priority to the extent of the indebtedness recited in the agreement.\nI would allow the appeal and direct (1) that out of the moneys in court there be paid to Dunkley the sum of $1,193.08, plus interest at 4 1\/2 per cent from the date of sale, (this represents the value of his exemptions, as to which there is no question); (2) that the sum of $45,631.01, together with interest at 4 1\/2 per cent from the date of the sale, be paid to Hurly; (3) that the balance be paid to the Bank of Nova Scotia. The appellants Hurly and the Toronto Dominion Bank are entitled to one set of costs against the Bank of Nova Scotia at trial, on appeal and in this Court. I would not disturb the order for costs of $620 made in favour of Dunkley at the trial and added to his claim for exemptions nor the order for costs in the Appellate Division made in favour of Hurly against Dunkley.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, appellants: Milner, Steer, Dyde, Massie, Layton, Cregan and Macdonnell, Edmonton.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Fenerty, Fenerty, McGillivray, Robertson, Prowse, Brennan and Fraser, Calgary.\n[1] (1965), 52 W.W.R. 513.\n",

The company undertook also to make an annual contribution of a sum based upon the ratio of its profits if such profits exceeded a certain percentage of its invested capital. During the year 1959, the company made monthly contributions but no annual contribution. The amount of the company's contributions in 1959 allocated to the respondent was ruled by the Minister to be taxable in the respondent's hands on the ground that the plan was an \"employees profit sharing plan\" within s. 79(1) of the Income Tax Act. The Minister's contention was upheld by the Tax Appeal Board, but was rejected by the Exchequer Court. The Minister was granted leave to appeal to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe plan in the present case was not an \"employees profit sharing plan\" as defined in s. 79(1) of the Income Tax Act, since the payments were not computed by reference to the employer's profits from its business. An arrangement under which the amount of payments made by the employer is fixed by the amount contributed by his employees, regardless of whether he does or does not make a profit, is not brought within the definition in s. 79(1) of the Act merely because the employer agrees to make an additional payment in those years, if any, in which his profits exceed a certain ratio.\nRevenu\u2014Imp\u00f4t sur le revenu\u2014Plan de participation aux b\u00e9n\u00e9fices\u2014Plan d\u2019achats de valeurs mobili\u00e8res pour les employ\u00e9s\u2014Le plan est-il un \u00ab plan de participation des employ\u00e9s aux b\u00e9n\u00e9fices \u00bb\u2014Loi de l\u2019Imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, S.R.C. 1952. c.148, arts. 6(1)(k),79(1), (3), (7).\nLa compagnie, dont l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait un employ\u00e9 administrait un plan d\u2019achats de valeurs mobili\u00e8res en vertu duquel la compagnie contribuait une somme mensuelle \u00e9gale \u00e0 50 pour-cent des contributions mensuelles de l\u2019employ\u00e9.

Appel rejet\u00e9.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of No\u00ebl J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, reversing a decision of the Tax Appeal Board. Appeal dismissed.\nG. W. Ainslie and D.G.H. Bowman, for the appellant.\nP. N. Thorsteinsson, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This appeal is brought, pursuant to leave granted in accordance with the provisions of s. 84 of the Exchequer Court Act, from a judgment1 of No\u00ebl J. allowing an appeal by the respondent from a decision of the Tax Appeal Board in regard to the respondent's assessment for the taxation year 1959.\nThere is no dispute as to the facts. The question to be decided is whether an arrangement entered into between Richfield Oil Corporation, the employer of the respondent, and certain of its employees, including the respondent, is \"an employees profit sharing plan\" within the meaning of that phrase as defined in s. 79 of the Income Tax Act.\nThe arrangement is in written form and is produced as an exhibit to the agreed statement of facts upon which the matter has been dealt with. It is entitled \"Stock Purchase Plan for Employees of Richfield Oil Corporation\".\nMembership in the plan is voluntary. It is open to any person regularly employed by Richfield Oil Corporation, hereinafter referred to as \"the Company\", who has completed at least one year of service with the Company, is not over sixty-five years of age if a man or over sixty years of age if a woman and who files a completed application form with the administrator of the plan. A member is obligated to contribute a monthly sum determined by himself but not less than $5 nor more than 5 per cent of his monthly salary, to be paid through authorized pay-roll deductions; he may change the amount of his contribution, within the foregoing limits, on any January 1 or July 1 by filing a written request with the administrator. Failure to make the monthly contribution is construed as a voluntary withdrawal from the plan.\nThe provisions of the plan providing for the payments to be made by the Company read as follows:\nContributions by Company\nA. Monthly Contribution. The Company will make a monthly contribution of a sum equal to 50 per cent of the member contributions made each month. These monthly contributions by the Company shall be reduced by amounts forfeited, if any, during the preceding month by members withdrawing from the Plan.\nB. Annual Contribution. The Company will make an annual contribution of a sum based upon the ratio of its profits to invested capital which will adjust the total monthly contributions made by the Company to the following schedule:\nCompany Contribution\nPer Cent of Profits\nas per cent of\nto Invested Capital\nMember Contribution\nUp to but less than 11%\n50%\n11% but less than 12%\n55%\n12% but less than 13%\n60%\n13% but less than 14%\n65%\n15% or over\n75%\n14% but less than 15%\n70%\n'Invested Capital' shall mean the total of all Capital Stock and Surplus (or equivalent) accounts and Long Term Debt of the Company as of the beginning of the preceding calendar year, as reflected in its printed Annual Report to stockholders.\n'Profits' shall mean the Company's Net Income after taxes for the preceding calendar year, as shown in its printed Annual Report to stockholders. This annual contribution, if any, shall be made as of March 31 of each year, beginning in 1955, and shall be related only to total member contributions made in the preceding calendar year which have not been withdrawn as of said March 31.\nParagraph 4 of the Agreed Statement of Facts sets out the contributions made by the Company in respect of Canadian members of the plan since the inception of the plan in 1953 up to the end of 1959 as follows:\nContributions in respect of\nCanadian members only.\nYear\nSection IV\nSection IV\nPart A\nPart B\nMonthly\nAnnual\n1953\n$ 120\nNone\n1954\n388\nNone\n1955\n903\nNone\n1956\n1,738\n$ 84\n1957\n3,146\nNone\n1958\n4,175\nNone\n1959\n8,592\nNone\n$19,062\n$ 84\nSection 79(1) of the Income Tax Act reads:\n79 (1) In this Act, an 'employees profit sharing plan' means an arrangement under which payments computed by reference to his profits from his business or by reference to his profits from his business and the profits, if any, from the business of a corporation with whom he does not deal at arm's length are made by an employer to a trustee in trust for the benefit of officers or employees of the employer or of a corporation with whom the employer does not deal at arm's length (whether or not payments are also made to the trustee by the officers or employees), and under which the trustee has, since the commencement of the plan or the end of 1949, whichever is the later, each year allocated either contingently or absolutely to individual officers or employees,\n(a) all amounts received by him from the employer or from a corporation with whom the employer does not deal at arm's length, and\n(b) all profits from the trust property (computed without regard to any capital gain made by the trust or capital loss sustained by it at any time since the end of 1955),\nin such manner that the aggregate of all such amounts and such profits minus such portion thereof as has been paid to beneficiaries under the trust is allocated either contingently or absolutely to officers or employees who are beneficiaries thereunder.\nOther sub-sections of s. 79 provide, inter alia, that the amount of payments into the plan made by the employer and allocated by the trustee to an employee either contingently or absolutely during the year are required to be included in the employee's income for the year.\nI agree with the submission made by counsel for the appellant that in order that the plan with which we are concerned may be considered an \"employees profit-sharing plan\" it must fulfil the following conditions:\n(1) the employer must make payments to a trustee in trust for the benefit of its employees;\n(2) the payments must be computed by reference to the employer's profits from its business;\n(3) all amounts paid to the trustee and all profits (except capital gains or losses realized or sustained since 1955) must, in each year, be allocated either contingently or absolutely to individual employees.\nIt is common ground that the plan complies with the first and third of these conditions; the difference of opinion between the Exchequer Court and the Tax Appeal Board is as to whether it complies with the second. For the reasons given by No\u00ebl J. I agree with his conclusion that it does not and there is little that I wish to add.\nThe answer to this question no doubt depends primarily upon the construction of s. 79(1) read in the context of the whole Act, so that the actual results of the operation of the plan from the date of its inception up to the end of the year 1959 are not of decisive importance; but it is interesting to note that the contributions made by the Company during that period under Part A of Section IV which are computed by reference to the payments made by employees and which the Company was bound to make regardless of the amount of its profits, if any, total $19,062 while the contributions made by the Company under Part B of the section which are computed by reference to the Company's profits total only $84. It would be a strange result if an arrangement, under which no payment computed by reference to its profits was made by an employer in the taxation year in question and of the total payment it made during the seven years of the operation of the arrangement only 1\/2 of 1 per cent was so computed, were held to fall within the definition contained in s. 79 (1).\nEven if it had happened that in every year of the plan's operation the ratio of the Company's profits to invested capital had exceeded 15 per cent, the result would have been that 2\/3 of the payments made by the Company would have been computed by reference to one factor only, the amount paid by its employees, while the remaining 1\/3 would have been computed by reference to two factors (i) the amount paid by its employees, and (ii) the profits of the Company.\nI agree with the submission of counsel for the respondent that the construction of s. 79(1) contended for by the appellant involves substituting for the words \"payments computed by reference to his profits from his business\" the words \"payments computed by reference to a formula of which his profit from his business is one of the variable components\". I do not think the words of the section are susceptible of that interpretation. In my opinion, an arrangement under which the amount of payments made by an employer is fixed by the amount contributed by his employees, regardless of whether he does or does not make a profit, is not brought within the definition in s. 79(1) merely because the employer agrees to make an additional payment in those years, if any, in which his profits exceed a certain ratio.\nFor the reasons given by No\u00ebl J. with which I have already expressed my agreement and those briefly stated above I would dismiss this appeal with costs which, in accordance with the terms of the order granting leave to appeal, will be taxed on a solicitor and client basis.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: E. S. MacLatchy, Ottawa.\nSolicitor for the respondent: P. N. Thorsteinsson, Vancouver.\n[1] [1965] 1 Ex. C.R. 214, [1964] C.T.C. 305, 64 D.T.C. 5189.\n",

The syndicate agreement was an oral one. The syndicate's drilling was unsuccessful and its funds were exhausted in 1956. In March 1957, the appellant refused to contribute further funds to the syndicate, and although the other members of the syndicate could have terminated the appellant's interest therein, they continued to treat him as a member indebted to the syndicate. In 1958, the appellant sold its interest in the syndicate to another syndicate member for $1. The appellant treated the $80,000 as a loss suffered in 1957, and by virtue of s. 27(1) (e) of the Income Tax Act, carried it back and deducted it from its 1956 income. The Minister disallowed the deduction on the ground that the loss was not sustained in the 1957 taxation year. The Exchequer Court held that the loss was not deductible until 1958. The appellant company appealed to this Court, where another question (regarding inventory valuation) was raised but later abandoned.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nThe appellant company was entitled to the deduction claimed. The realized trading loss occurred in June 1958 when the appellant sold its interest in the syndicate. However, it was admitted that this interest was an inventory asset and that, in computing its income for the taxation year ended March 31, 1957, the appellant was entitled to value the interest at its cost or its fair market value whichever was lower. The evidence established, on a balance of probabilities, that on March 31, 1957, the fair market value of the appellant's interest in the syndicate did not exceed $1.\nRevenu\u2014Imp\u00f4t sur le revenu\u2014D\u00e9ductions\u2014N\u00e9gociant en valeurs mobili\u00e8res\u2014Perte sur vente d'une part dans un syndicat\u2014Biens d\u00e9crits dans un inventaire\u2014Juste valeur marchande\u2014Ann\u00e9e dans laquelle la perte est survenue\u2014Loi de l'Imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, S.R.C. 1952, c. 148, arts. 12(1)(a), 14(2), 27(1)(e).\nLa compagnie appelante avait obtenu une part dans un syndicat constitu\u00e9 en vue de l'exploitation pour la d\u00e9couverte du p\u00e9trole, et le montant total de ses contributions se chiffrait \u00e0 quelque $80,000. Le contrat entre les associ\u00e9s \u00e9tait un contrat verbal. Le forage fait par le syndicat n'a pas eu de succ\u00e8s et en 1956 les fonds du syndicat \u00e9taient \u00e9puis\u00e9s. En mars 1957, la compagnie appelante refusa de contribuer d'autres fonds au syndicat, et quoique les autres membres auraient pu mettre fin au contrat avec l'appelante, ils ont continu\u00e9 de la traiter comme un membre endett\u00e9 envers le syndicat. En 1958, l'appelante a vendu sa part dans le syndicat \u00e0 un autre membre du syndicat pour la somme de $1. L'appelante a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 le $80,000 comme \u00e9tant une perte survenue en 1957, et se basant sur l'art. 27(1) (e) de la Loi de l'Imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, l'a rapport\u00e9e et d\u00e9duite de son imp\u00f4t pour l'ann\u00e9e 1956. Le Ministre a refus\u00e9 la d\u00e9duction pour le motif que la perte n'\u00e9tait pas survenue durant l'ann\u00e9e de taxation 1957. La Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier a jug\u00e9 que la perte n'\u00e9tait pas d\u00e9ductible avant 1958. La compagnie en appela devant cette Cour.

La perte commerciale est survenue en juin 1958 lorsque l'appelante a vendu sa part dans le syndicat. Cependant, il est admis que cette part \u00e9tait un bien d\u00e9crit dans un inventaire et que, en calculant son imp\u00f4t pour l'ann\u00e9e de taxation finissant le 31 mars 1957, l'appelante avait droit d'\u00e9valuer la part au prix co\u00fbtant ou \u00e0 sa juste valeur marchande selon le moindre des deux. La pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la preuve \u00e9tait \u00e0 l'effet que le 31 mars 1957, la juste valeur marchande de la part de l'appelante dans le syndicat n'exc\u00e9dait pas la somme de $1.\nAPPEL d'un jugement du Juge Cattanach de la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier du Canada[1], confirmant la cotisation du Ministre. Appel maintenu.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Cattanach J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada[2], affirming the Minister's assessment. Appeal allowed.\nH. Howard Stikeman, Q.C., and P. N. Thorsteinsson, for the appellant.\nG. W. Ainslie and M. A. Mogan, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment[3], of Cattanach J. dismissing an appeal from the appellant's assessment for its taxation year ending March 31, 1956.\nWhile additional matters were dealt with in the Court below the appeal to this Court raised only the two following questions:\n(i) Whether the learned trial judge erred in finding that the appellant was not entitled in valuing its 1956 closing inventory of securities to make a deduction for known costs of sale of items included therein at market value, viz. $21,105.56 for brokerage payable on sale, and $1,648.23 for security transfer tax payable on sale, and\n(ii) Whether the learned trial judge erred in finding that the appellant was not entitled to write down from $80,568.38 to $1.00 its inventory asset consisting of its interest in a syndicate, referred to as \"the Jerd Syndicate\", in the course of valuing its closing inventory on March 31, 1957 and in holding that the loss of $80,567.38, which was admittedly sustained by the appellant in respect of this syndicate, should be treated as having been sustained in a later year.\nAfter some argument had been addressed to us on the first of these points it was abandoned by counsel for the appellant because it appeared that, even if the argument in respect of it were successful, the amount of the deduction claimed would be offset by an error in calculation in respect of other items in the closing inventory. I mention this in order to make it clear that this question having been withdrawn from our consideration we express no opinion upon it.\nTurning to the second question, it is common ground that the appellant's interest in the Jerd Syndicate was an inventory asset, that in computing income for the taxation year ending March 31, 1957, the appellant was entitled to value it at its cost or its fair market value whichever was lower, that the cost of the asset to the appellant was $80,568.38 and that in its balance sheet for the year ending March 31, 1957, the appellant did in fact value it at $1.\nThe question becomes one of fact, whether the evidence established, on a balance of probabilities, that on March 31, 1957, the fair market value of the asset did not exceed $1.\nThe appellant was incorporated on December 23, 1954. Prior to this date a partnership known as Draper Dobie and Company carried on business in two branches, an underwriting and trading branch and a commission branch. On its incorporation the appellant took over the underwriting and trading business formerly carried on by the partnership. Among the assets acquired from the partnership was the interest in the Jerd Syndicate. In March 1955, the partnership had contributed $50,000 to the Syndicate. The appellant made further contributions bringing the total investment up to $80,568.34. The dates of these further contributions are not fixed with precision but it is clear that the latest of them was prior to March 31, 1957. The partners in Draper Dobie and Company included Mr. H. W. Knight and Mr. Geo. W. Gooderman who are now President and Vice President of the appellant.\nBefore the appellant was incorporated, Mr. Robert Bryce, a mining engineer and promoter and manager of mining and oil exploration and development companies was interested in an area in Alberta adjacent to the British Columbia border which he hoped would prove to be oil producing. He first obtained a reservation which he later converted into lease holdings. It was a condition of the leases so obtained that Mr. Bryce should expend $200,000 in exploration. The area consisted of 40,000 acres in all, but a 25 per cent interest in it had been acquired by another party. The expenditure of $200,000 by Mr. Bryce would entitle him to a 75 per cent interest so that he would own the leasehold in 30,000 acres while the other party owned 10,000 acres. The area of 40,000 acres was unsurveyed. The 10,000 acres owned by the other party consisted of a corner of each section, the balance being owned by Mr. Bryce. Because of the fact that the area was unsurveyed it followed that the limits of the respective holdings of Mr. Bryce and the other party could not be clearly defined.\nIn order to raise the amount of $200,000 which was to be expended as a condition of the lease, Mr. Bryce formed a syndicate. Mr. H. W. Knight, Mr. Knight's father and Mr. Gooderman personally participated in this syndicate. The amount of $200,000 was raised through the syndicate so formed and was expended in the drilling of an oil well on the property. The amount of $200,000 was exhausted in drilling without oil being discovered and a company was formed under the name of Jerd Petroleum Company, Limited which then became the owner of the leasehold interest in the 30,000 acres. The members of the syndicate became shareholders in Jerd Petroleum Company, Limited in proportion of their participation in the syndicate and the syndicate was dissolved.\nIn order to finance further drilling, Mr. Bryce, who has been the prime mover throughout, formed a second syndicate. This second syndicate is the Jerd Syndicate with which we are concerned. Draper Dobie and Company was a member of this syndicate and as indicated above made an expenditure of $50,000 as its proportionate share. It was this interest which was acquired by the appellant from the partnership.\nThe members of the Jerd Syndicate were Mr. Bryce, 10 per cent, Mr. Wayne, 10 per cent, Amerex Oil, 20 per cent, Decalta Oil, 30 per cent and the appellant, 30 per cent. There were subsequent changes in proportion and membership which are not material but the interest of the appellant remained a constant 30 per cent. Jerd Petroleum Company, Limited, owned a half interest in this venture and contributed half of the funds expended and the Jerd Syndicate owned the remaining half interest and was obligated to contribute one half of the funds to be raised. Jerd Petroleum Company, Limited was not a member of the Jerd Syndicate.\nThe Syndicate agreement was not reduced to writing. The custom in the trade was to conduct such arrangements orally and if necessity should arise to commit the arrangement to writing at a later time. It was understood, however, that each member of this syndicate was required to put up an amount of money in proportion to his membership interest each time an assessment was called and if the member did not meet the assessment then that member's interest was lost and the remaining members were to be offered the opportunity to take up the interest of the member in default.\nThe purpose of the appellant in entering into the Jerd Syndicate was two-fold, first, if oil were discovered the appellant would participate in the benefits thereof and second, if success attended the venture, there was a tacit understanding, though an unwritten one, that the appellant would be given the first refusal to underwrite the shares in any company which might be formed to acquire and operate the oil or gas field.\nJerd Syndicate, in conjunction with Jerd Petroleum Company, Limited, sank the well to a depth of 4,779 feet. At that depth harder rock was encountered than had been anticipated. A heavier drill would be required to penetrate deeper, but because of the cost involved, drilling was stopped on March 9, 1956, and has not since been resumed.\nAt the time drilling ceased the syndicate's funds on hand were exhausted, but the obligation to pay the annual lease rental of $30,000, being $1. an acre, continued, a payment in that amount falling due on July 4th of each year. Jerd Petroleum Company, Limited was responsible for $15,000 of the annual rental and the Jerd Syndicate was responsible for an equal amount. The appellant's proportionate share of this liability was $4,500 for July 4, 1957. The appellant did not pay this amount into the syndicate.\nMr. Bryce, in his capacity as head of the Jerd Syndicate, called on Mr. Knight in March 1957, for the purpose of obtaining the appellant's payment of $4,500. Mr. Knight as president of the appellant, informed Mr. Bryce that the appellant did not intend to contribute this or any further sum. The appellant's interest in the Jerd Syndicate was not terminated upon this default as it might have been under the terms of the syndicate agreement and the appellant continued to be looked upon as a member of the syndicate by the other members. The syndicate treated the appellant as a member which was indebted to the syndicate in the amount of $4,500. A further payment of rent was falling due on July 4, 1958. In March 1958, Mr. Bryce again approached Mr. Knight for the appellant's contribution. Mr. Knight reiterated the appellant's previous decision to participate no further in the Syndicate and offered to sell the appellant's interest therein to Mr. Bryce for $1. and the assumption of the appellant's outstanding obligation to the Syndicate of $4,500 and of the further obligation of $4,500 becoming due on July 4, 1958. Mr. Bryce consulted the other members of the Jerd Syndicate who agreed to Mr. Bryce purchasing the appellant's interest.\nOn June 5, 1958, the appellant executed an agreement for sale of its interest in the Jerd Syndicate for the consideration of $1. in cash and the assumption of the appellant's outstanding obligation of $4,500 and a future obligation of $4,500 due on July 4, 1958.\nThe consideration so paid was $4,501 but, as is pointed out by the learned trial judge, this has no bearing on the amount of the appellant's alleged loss of $80,567.38 because if the obligation of $4,500 had been paid by the appellant then the loss of $80,567.38 claimed would have been increased by an amount of $4,500 and when the monetary consideration received was deducted from that greater figure, the amount of the loss would remain constant at $80,567.38. The learned trial judge after setting out the facts recited above went on to hold that the appellant had suffered a loss of $80,567.38 which was properly deductible for income tax purposes and that it remained to decide when the loss occurred. The reasons of the learned trial judge continued as follows:\nWhile it was possible that the appellant's interest in the syndicate might have been forfeited in March, 1957 by reason of the appellant's failure to pay its assessment of $4,500 in accordance with the verbal syndicate agreement, nevertheless, the appellant's participation was not ended at that time. The syndicate did not act upon the default, but continued to treat the appellant as a member indebted to the syndicate in the amount of the default. The appellant, on its part, also considered itself a member otherwise it would not have been able to sell its interest to Mr. Bryce as it did on June 5, 1958, some fourteen months later. In my opinion the loss was not in the fiscal year ending March 31, 1957, but in the 1958 (sic) taxation year.\nWith the greatest respect to the learned trial judge I find myself in agreement with the submission of counsel for the appellant that this reasoning leads to the conclusion that as a matter of accounting the realized trading loss occurred in June of 1958 but leaves unanswered the question whether the fair market value of the asset, admittedly then still owned by the appellant, did not exceed $1. on March 31, 1957.\nThe evidence relevant to this question consists of the inferences to be drawn from the recital of the facts set out above and from the testimony at the trial of Mr. H. W. Knight, Mr. Greenwood, who is the auditor of the appellant, and Mr. Bryce.\nI have considered with care all the evidence of these witnesses bearing on this point and have reached the conclusion that it should be found as a fact that by March 31, 1957, the fair market value of the appellant's interest in the Jerd Syndicate did not exceed $1.\nIn coming to this decision I am influenced particularly by the following matters.\n(a) Prior to March 31, 1957, Mr. Knight had clearly formed the opinion that the asset had ceased to be of any value and was willing that the appellant should forfeit it rather than make any further contribution and he had so advised Mr. Bryce. (b) The auditor of the company after going into the matter with Mr. Knight shared his opinion and certified the appellant's balance sheet accordingly.\n(c) Drilling on the Syndicate property had ceased on March 9, 1956, and no further drilling had been done up to March 31, 1957, or indeed up to the date of the trial, in June 1962.\n(d) No favourable results had been obtained from the drilling that was done.\n(e) The funds of the Syndicate were exhausted but the liability to pay rentals continued.\n(f) The appellant in fact sold its interest for $1. in June 1958, and nothing had occurred between March 31, 1957, and June 1958, to alter the market value of the interest.\nAs against all this there was the opinion of Mr. Bryce that the property was still worth holding, but this opinion has not been vindicated by subsequent events and does not appear to have been shared by the other members of the Syndicate, none of whom were willing to take over their proportionate share of the interest which the appellant relinquished.\nConsidering the whole of the evidence it appears to me to be shewn that on the balance of probabilities the correct finding is that on March 31, 1957, the fair market value of the appellant's interest in the Syndicate was not more than $1.\nFor these reasons I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the Exchequer Court and direct that the assessment be referred back to the respondent to be amended in accordance with these reasons. While the appellant raised other points in the Court below and one other point in this Court on which it did not succeed it has succeeded on a substantial issue and is entitled to its costs in this Court and in the Exchequer Court.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Stikeman and Elliott, Montreal.\nSolicitor for the respondent: E.

Il a enregistr\u00e9 cette raison sociale au bureau du Protonotaire du district de St-Hyacinthe le 28 mars 1939.\nL'appelant Martel exploite un service de transport similaire \u00e0 celui de l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al et St-Hyacinthe. Martel admet qu'il savait depuis 1940 que Filion faisait usage du nom et raison sociale de \u00ab Acton Vale Transport \u00bb. En d\u00e9pit de cette connaissance acquise, Martel enregistra cette m\u00eame raison sociale au bureau du Protonotaire du district de Montr\u00e9al le 8 avril 1953.

Cette d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 infirm\u00e9e par un jugement majoritaire de la Cour du banc de la reine[2]. Cet appel est de ce jugement.\nLa question \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre est celle-ci. Qui a droit au recours de l'art. 13 de la loi susdite? Cet article se lit:\nAucune d\u00e9claration prescrite par la pr\u00e9sente section ne peut \u00eatre enregistr\u00e9e si une personne ou une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 y prend un nom, un titre ou une raison sociale qui est la d\u00e9signation d'une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 existante ou d'une autre personne, ou qui y ressemble tellement que le public peut \u00eatre induit en erreur.\nTout enregistrement fait contrairement aux dispositions du pr\u00e9sent article peut \u00eatre annul\u00e9 par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure du district sur requ\u00eate, apr\u00e8s avis donn\u00e9 aux int\u00e9ress\u00e9s et au protonotaire.\nJe partage l'avis exprim\u00e9 par monsieur le Juge en Chef Tremblay que la protection des tiers est le seul but poursuivi par cette loi et je fais mienne sa conclusion, qui suit:\nElle stipule l'enregistrement pour permettre aux tiers de d\u00e9couvrir facilement les personnes, morales ou physiques, avec lesquelles ils font affaires. Toujours sous la m\u00eame r\u00e9serve quant \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 en commandite, je ne crois pas qu'elle ait pour effet de cr\u00e9er aucun droit en faveur de la personne qui effectue l'enregistrement. En effet, l'article 13 prohibe non pas l'enregistrement d'un nom, d'un titre ou d'une raison sociale d\u00e9j\u00e0 enregistr\u00e9, mais l'enregistrement d'un nom, d'un titre ou d'une raison sociale \u00ab qui est la d\u00e9signation d'une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 existante ou d'une autre personne, ou qui y ressemble tellement que le public peut \u00eatre induit en erreur \u00bb.\nLa preuve \u00e9tablit clairement que Filion faisait affaires sous le nom \u00ab Acton Vale Transport \u00bb depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es quand Martel a enregistr\u00e9 ce m\u00eame nom \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al en 1953, et cela \u00e0 la connaissance de ce dernier. Martel a alors pris un nom qui est la d\u00e9signation d'une autre personne. Par cons\u00e9quent, il ne peut avoir le droit de demander par requ\u00eate, en vertu de l'art. 13, l'annulation de l'enregistrement effectu\u00e9 par Filion le 7 juillet 1958 au bureau du Protonotaire du district de Montr\u00e9al.\nJe renverrais l'appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppel rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nProcureur du demandeur, appelant: Howard, Cate, Ogilvy, Bishop, Cope, Porteous & Hansard, Montr\u00e9al.\nProcureurs du d\u00e9fendeur, intim\u00e9: Lajoie, G\u00e9linas, Lajoie, Bourque & Lalonde, Montr\u00e9al.\n[1] [1964] B.R. 9.\n[2] [1964] B.R. 9.",

Advenant le jour fix\u00e9 pour le proc\u00e8s, la demanderesse r\u00e9v\u00e9la \u00e0 la Cour et aux procureurs que subs\u00e9quemment \u00e0 l'inscription de la cause pour enqu\u00eate et audition au m\u00e9rite, elle s'\u00e9tait remari\u00e9e. Il fut alors convenu par le juge et les procureurs des parties que la cause proc\u00e9derait quand m\u00eame et avec le m\u00eame effet que si le dossier \u00e9tait r\u00e9gulier et dans l'ordre, et qu'une requ\u00eate en reprise d'instance pour r\u00e9gulariser le dossier serait produite et accord\u00e9e du consentement des procureurs. Une requ\u00eate permettant \u00e0 la demanderesse de reprendre l'instance en sa qualit\u00e9 d'\u00e9pouse fut accord\u00e9e subs\u00e9quemment. Mais par suite d'un oubli commun \u00e0 tous on omit de pourvoir \u00e0 la tutelle des mineurs. Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance accueillit l'action. Durant l'instance en Cour d'Appel, la demanderesse et son \u00e9poux furent nomm\u00e9s tuteurs conjoints et autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 continuer les proc\u00e9dures tant en Cour sup\u00e9rieure qu'en Cour d'Appel. Le d\u00e9fendeur contesta la requ\u00eate de la demanderesse demandant permission de produire au dossier ce dernier jugement de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure la nommant conjointement tutrice avec son mari. La Cour d'Appel accueillit cette requ\u00eate et maintint l'action quant \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 et au quantum des dommages. Le d\u00e9fendeur en appela \u00e0 cette Cour.\nArr\u00eat: L'appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9.\nIl ressort des dispositions de l'art. 283 du Code civil que la demanderesse et son mari avaient au jour du proc\u00e8s, \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des mineurs, la responsabilit\u00e9 de g\u00e9rant d'affaires. \u00c0 ce titre, ils pouvaient validement faire la convention en question. Les dispositions des arts. 269 et 270 du Code de proc\u00e9dure civile ne pouvaient faire obstacle \u00e0 cette entente. La nullit\u00e9 d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9e par l'art. 269 n'est pas une nullit\u00e9 absolue mais une nullit\u00e9 relative qui ne peut \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9e que par ceux dont les int\u00e9r\u00eats ne sont pas repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s. Ce contrat judiciaire que les deux parties \u00e0 l'entente pouvaient, par un consentement mutuel motiv\u00e9 par leurs obligations ou leurs int\u00e9r\u00eats, validement former vis-\u00e0-vis la Cour avait pour cause et objet v\u00e9ritables d'\u00e9carter toute objection bas\u00e9e sur le remariage de la demanderesse. Ma\u00eetres du litige, les parties ont manifestement voulu faire porter le d\u00e9bat uniquement sur le m\u00e9rite de la r\u00e9clamation de la demanderesse et de celle des mineurs. Elles sont maintenant li\u00e9es par la m\u00e9thode qu'elles ont mutuellement adopt\u00e9e pour la conduite du proc\u00e8s. En somme, le d\u00e9fendeur aurait pu validement consentir \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de la demanderesse devant la Cour d'Appel et, la Cour d'Appel ne pouvait faire droit \u00e0 son objection sans mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 le contrat judiciaire auquel il avait donn\u00e9 son consentement.\nSur le m\u00e9rite, la d\u00e9fendeur n'a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'il y avait lieu de faire exception \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle de non intervention de cette Cour dans les cas o\u00f9, comme en l'esp\u00e8ce, la question de responsabilit\u00e9 en est une de fait sur laquelle la Cour d'Appel et la Cour sup\u00e9rieure ont form\u00e9 une m\u00eame opinion.\nSur le quantum des dommages, tenant compte des circonstances de cette cause et des principes guidant cette Cour dans la consid\u00e9ration d'une demande de revision du quantum, il n'y \u00e0 pas lieu d'intervenir. Voir Fognan v. Ure et al., [1958] R.C.S. 377.\nAPPEL d'un jugement de la Cour du banc de la reine, province de Qu\u00e9bec[1], confirmant un jugement du Juge Corriveau. Appel rejet\u00e9.\nG\u00e9rard Deslandes, c.r., pour le d\u00e9fendeur, appelant.\nFran\u00e7ois Veilleux, c.r., pour la demanderesse, intim\u00e9e. Le jugement de la Cour fut rendu par\nLE JUGE FAUTEUX:\u2014Le 29 mars 1959, Louis-Philippe Leblanc, son \u00e9pouse Dame Arnolda Glazier et leurs enfants mineurs, Jacques, Lise, Claire et Pierre, revenaient \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al d'un voyage en automobile lorsque, \u00e0 quelques milles de Drummondville, district d'Arthabaska, la voiture, alors conduite par Louis-Philippe Leblanc, vint en collision avec une automobile conduite par l'appelant, sur la m\u00eame route, mais en direction oppos\u00e9e. Louis-Philippe Leblanc fut tu\u00e9 sur-le-champ; Claire Leblanc fut mortellement bless\u00e9e et d\u00e9c\u00e9da quelques jours apr\u00e8s son admission \u00e0 l'h\u00f4pital; les autres passagers subirent de graves blessures et l'automobile dans laquelle ils voyageaient fut virtuellement d\u00e9molie.\nDans l'ann\u00e9e qui suivit ce malheureux accident, la veuve de Leblanc, Dame Glazier, se fit nommer tutrice \u00e0 ses enfants mineurs, Jacques, Lise et Pierre, respectivement \u00e2g\u00e9s de quatorze, douze et neuf ans, et autoriser, en cette qualit\u00e9, \u00e0 poursuivre l'appelant pour obtenir r\u00e9paration du dommage caus\u00e9 \u00e0 ces derniers. Agissant en cette qualit\u00e9 aussi bien que personnellement, comme l\u00e9gataire universelle et ex\u00e9cutrice testamentaire, elle institua, dans le m\u00eame d\u00e9lai, la pr\u00e9sente action contre l'appelant, lui r\u00e9clamant en totalit\u00e9 la somme de $184,133.95. Cette action fut contest\u00e9e et fut inscrite pour enqu\u00eate et audition au m\u00e9rite le 29 octobre 1960. Advenant le jour fix\u00e9 pour le proc\u00e8s devant la Cour sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 Drummondville, soit le 28 novembre 1961, l'intim\u00e9e r\u00e9v\u00e9la \u00e0 la Cour, pr\u00e9sid\u00e9e par M. le Juge Corriveau, ainsi qu'aux procureurs des parties, le fait que le 19 ao\u00fbt 1961, par cons\u00e9quent apr\u00e8s l'inscription de la cause, elle s'\u00e9tait remari\u00e9e \u00e0 Raymond Chabot. Comme de nombreux t\u00e9moins, dont plusieurs venus des cit\u00e9s de Qu\u00e9bec et de Montr\u00e9al, \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sents en Cour aux fins de ce proc\u00e8s r\u00e9sultant d'un accident remontant d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e0 plus de deux ans et demi, il fut convenu par le Juge et les procureurs des parties que la cause proc\u00e9derait quand m\u00eame et avec le m\u00eame effet que si le dossier \u00e9tait r\u00e9gulier et dans l'ordre, ainsi qu'il appert de l'inscription suivante au proc\u00e8s-verbal:\nUne requ\u00eate en reprise d'instance pour r\u00e9gulariser le dossier vu que le t\u00e9moin est remari\u00e9e sera produite et accord\u00e9e du consentement des procureurs, frais \u00e0 suivre. Les procureurs consentent \u00e0 ce que la cause continue aujourd'hui et cela au m\u00eame effet que si le dossier \u00e9tait r\u00e9gulier et dans l'ordre. Apr\u00e8s enqu\u00eate sur tous les points contest\u00e9s, y compris celui du quantum des dommages subis par les mineurs, le tout sans objection mais du consentement du procureur de l'appelant, la cause fut prise en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9. Subs\u00e9quemment et pour faire suite \u00e0 la convention ci-dessus, une requ\u00eate permettant \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e de reprendre l'instance \u00ab en sa qualit\u00e9 d'\u00e9pouse de Raymond Chabot, d\u00fbment autoris\u00e9e par ce dernier, et de la continuer, frais \u00e0 suivre, \u00bb fut pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e et \u00e9ventuellement accord\u00e9e de consentement, le 26 Janvier 1962, par M. le Juge Corriveau. Cependant, et par suite d'un oubli commun \u00e0 tous, on omit de pourvoir \u00e0 la tutelle des mineurs, ce qui \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour rendre le dossier \u00ab r\u00e9gulier et dans l'ordre \u00bb, vu que, par suite de son mariage \u00e0 Chabot, l'intim\u00e9e, jusqu'alors tutrice, \u00e9tait, depuis le jour de ce mariage, priv\u00e9e de cette charge. C'est ainsi que la convention faite au d\u00e9but de l'enqu\u00eate, n'\u00e9tant que partiellement ex\u00e9cut\u00e9e, M. le Juge Corriveau accueillait, le 22 mars 1963, l'action de l'intim\u00e9e, condamnait l'appelant \u00e0 lui payer, tant personnellement qu'en sa qualit\u00e9 de tutrice \u00e0 ses enfants mineurs, diff\u00e9rentes sommes se totalisant \u00e0 $50,393.95, et d\u00e9cr\u00e9tait en plus la suspension du permis de conduire de l'appelant jusqu'\u00e0 satisfaction du jugement, le tout avec d\u00e9pens.\nGigu\u00e8re interjeta appel de ce jugement. En revisant le dossier pour pr\u00e9parer son factum, le procureur de Gigu\u00e8re constata que le dossier n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gularis\u00e9 relativement \u00e0 la tutelle des mineurs et invoqua cette omission au soutien de son appel. Ce que voyant, l'intim\u00e9e et son \u00e9poux Raymond Chabot, agissant tant personnellement que pour autoriser son \u00e9pouse, s'adress\u00e8rent \u00e0 la Cour sup\u00e9rieure et, par jugement du 21 novembre 1963, furent nomm\u00e9s tuteurs conjoints aux mineurs et autoris\u00e9s\n\u00e0 continuer les proc\u00e9dures tant en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure qu'en Cour d'Appel sur les poursuites en dommages int\u00e9r\u00eats institu\u00e9es contre AMEDEE GIGUERE, de Drummondville, en cons\u00e9quence d'un accident d'automobiles survenu le 29 mars 1959, pr\u00e8s de Drummondville, \u00e0 recevoir paiement des dommages int\u00e9r\u00eats dus aux dits enfants mineurs et r\u00e9sultant du dit accident et des dites poursuites et des jugements rendus et \u00e0 intervenir tant en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure qu'en Cour d'Appel, et \u00e0 donner quittance pour et au nom des dits mineurs.\nEn ce qui \u00e0 trait particuli\u00e8rement aux proc\u00e9dures en Cour sup\u00e9rieure, cette autorisation est, dans ses termes, conforme et propre \u00e0 donner effet \u00e0 l'accord intervenu au d\u00e9but du proc\u00e8s. Par la suite, l'intim\u00e9e demanda \u00e0 la Cour d'Appel permission de produire au dossier ce jugement de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure et l'autorisation de continuer les proc\u00e9dures. Contest\u00e9e par l'appelant, cette requ\u00eate fut discut\u00e9e et prise en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 en m\u00eame temps que l'appel.\nLa Cour du Banc de la reine[2], par un jugement majoritaire, (Taschereau et Rivard JJ. A.), accueillit la requ\u00eate et, adjugeant au m\u00e9rite, d\u00e9clara partager enti\u00e8rement les vues et conclusions du Juge de premi\u00e8re instance tant sur la question de responsabilit\u00e9 que sur celle de quantum des dommages. Dissident, le Juge Bissonnette, dans des notes tr\u00e8s br\u00e8ves o\u00f9 rien n'est exprim\u00e9 sur le m\u00e9rite de la requ\u00eate, d\u00e9clara que la preuve sur la responsabilit\u00e9 \u00e9tait contradictoire et que, pour cette raison, le Juge de premi\u00e8re instance aurait d\u00fb rejeter l'action. L'appel fut donc rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens. D'o\u00f9 le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi \u00e0 cette Cour.\nA l'audition, la Cour, apr\u00e8s avoir entendu l'appelant, indiqua que l'intim\u00e9e n'avait pas \u00e0 plaider sur la question de responsabilit\u00e9. C'est qu'il n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9 de la part de l'appelant qu'il y avait lieu de faire exception \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle de non intervention de cette Cour dans les cas o\u00f9, comme en celui-ci, la question de responsabilit\u00e9 en est une de fait et non de droit sur laquelle la Cour d'Appel et la Cour sup\u00e9rieure ont form\u00e9 une m\u00eame opinion. Le procureur de l'intim\u00e9e fut invit\u00e9 \u00e0 limiter sa plaidoirie au quantum des dommages accord\u00e9s \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e par les deux Cours pour perte de soutien et \u00e0 l'objection de l'appelant relativement \u00e0 la position des mineurs. Il n'y \u00e0 donc que ces deux points qui doivent maintenant retenir notre attention.\nSans doute, si l'on consid\u00e8re que l'intim\u00e9e s'est remari\u00e9e, faut-il admettre que le montant qui lui est accorde pour perte de soutien est g\u00e9n\u00e9reux. Tenant compte, cependant, du fait que le revenu annuel de Chabot est bien inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 celui que faisait Leblanc, et des principes guidant cette Cour dans la consid\u00e9ration d'une demande de revision du quantum de dommages accord\u00e9s, nous sommes tous d'avis qu'il n'y \u00e0 pas lieu d'intervenir. Voir Fagnan v. Ure et al[3] et autorit\u00e9s cit\u00e9es en cette cause.\nLa d\u00e9termination du second point requiert la consid\u00e9ration de faits juridiques propres \u00e0 l'esp\u00e8ce. L'action de l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement intent\u00e9e et poursuivie par elle en sa qualit\u00e9 de tutrice jusqu'apr\u00e8s inscription de la cause pour enqu\u00eate et audition au m\u00e9rite. Ce n'est que quelque dix mois apr\u00e8s la date de cette inscription que l'intim\u00e9e s'est remari\u00e9e sous le r\u00e9gime de la s\u00e9paration de biens et que, juridiquement, le fait de son mariage produisit des cons\u00e9quences relatives, d'une part, \u00e0 la tutelle qui lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e et, d'autre part, aux proc\u00e9dures sur l'action validement intent\u00e9e par elle en sa qualit\u00e9 de tutrice.\nLe fait du mariage a, de plein droit, priv\u00e9 l'intim\u00e9e de la tutelle; mais de ce jour \u00e0 celui o\u00f9 elle et son mari furent nomm\u00e9s tuteurs conjoints, elle et son mari demeuraient responsables de la gestion des biens des mineurs et ce, \u00e0 titre de g\u00e9rants d'affaires. Voil\u00e0 ce qui ressort des dispositions de l'art. 283 du Code Civil, telles qu'elles se lisaient avant l'amendement de 1964, 13 Eliz. II, bill 16, art. 5\u2014, et de la doctrine sur le point.\nArt. 283. La femme qui \u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9e tutrice est priv\u00e9e de cette charge le jour o\u00f9 elle se marie ou se remarie, et le mari de la tutrice demeure responsable de la gestion des biens des mineurs pendant ce mariage, m\u00eame au cas o\u00f9 il n'y aurait pas de communaut\u00e9, jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'un nouveau tuteur soit nomm\u00e9.\nTrudel, Trait\u00e9 de Droit Civil du Qu\u00e9bec, vol. 2, p. 274:\nLe d\u00e9faut de remplacer la tutrice ou de lui adjoindre son mari entra\u00eene une sanction qui frappe particuli\u00e8rement ce dernier. Le mari, par le seul fait du mariage, devient responsable de la gestion de la tutelle qui \u00e9tait confi\u00e9e \u00e0 son \u00e9pouse. Non pas qu'il soit tuteur ou qu'il ait le droit d'administrer le patrimoine du mineur; cette sanction est \u00e9dict\u00e9e pour que le mari s'occupe au plus t\u00f4t de faire nommer un tuteur r\u00e9gulier. La responsabilit\u00e9 du mari s'\u00e9tend non seulement aux actes d'administration que son \u00e9pouse continuerait \u00e0 faire, mais encore aux dommages que pourrait subir le mineur, dont les biens resteraient sans administrateur si l'\u00e9pouse ne s'occupait plus de la tutelle.\nCette responsabilit\u00e9 du mari n'exclut pas celle de son \u00e9pouse. Le mariage lui \u00e0 fait perdre la tutelle, mais ne l'a pas d\u00e9charg\u00e9e de ses devoirs. Elle et son mari sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme des g\u00e9rants d'affaires des biens du mineur. Leur responsabilit\u00e9 est donc \u00e9gale.\nSirois, Tutelles et Curatelles, p. 108, n\u00b0 155:\n155.\u2014On demande si la m\u00e8re et son mari, dans les cas de la derni\u00e8re partie de l'article 283, sont tuteurs? La r\u00e9ponse est facile: ils ne sont pas tuteurs, puisque la premi\u00e8re partie de l'article dit formellement que la m\u00e8re qui se marie est priv\u00e9e de la tutelle. Si la m\u00e8re n'est pas tutrice, son mari ne peut l'\u00eatre. L'un et l'autre sont des g\u00e9rants d'affaires, et nous verrons dans la suite qu'ils ne sont pas soumis aux lois qui r\u00e9gissent la tutelle. Dans la Revue Trimestrielle de Droit Civil, 1903, vol. 2, p. 781, se trouve une \u00e9tude de la jurisprudence en France sur la tutelle de fait. Entre autres hypoth\u00e8ses, on envisage celle o\u00f9 la m\u00e8re, tutrice l\u00e9gale, se marie sans se faire maintenir dans la tutelle par le conseil de famille. On pr\u00e9cise qu'alors priv\u00e9e de la tutelle de droit, elle devient, avec son mari, tutrice de fait, et peut, en cette qualit\u00e9, valablement faire certains actes conservatoires que commande la protection des int\u00e9r\u00eats du mineur. La raison de cette substitution de la tutelle de fait \u00e0 la tutelle de droit est clairement expos\u00e9e au consid\u00e9rant suivant d'un arr\u00eat de la Cour de Cassation du 15 d\u00e9cembre 1825 rapport\u00e9 dans Devilleneuve et Carette, Arr\u00eats, vol. 8 1825-1827, 239, \u00e0 la page 240:\nConsid\u00e9rant que \u2026\nque cette substitution s'op\u00e8re n\u00e9cessairement et par la seule force des choses, puisque, s'il en \u00e9tait autrement, il y aurait un temps plus ou moins long pendant lequel la loi ne veillerait ni sur la personne, ni sur les biens du mineur, ce qui formerait, dans notre l\u00e9gislation, une lacune qu'il est impossible de supposer; \u2026\nAux fins de cette cause, il suffit de retenir que, suivant le Droit Civil du Qu\u00e9bec, l'intim\u00e9e et son mari avaient, \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des mineurs, au jour du proc\u00e8s, la responsabilit\u00e9 de g\u00e9rants d'affaires. Si, \u00e0 ce titre, ils ne pouvaient plaider au nom des mineurs, ils pouvaient et devaient, en tenant compte que l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de ceux-ci pouvait \u00eatre s\u00e9rieusement compromis par la remise \u00e0 une date plus \u00e9loign\u00e9e de ce proc\u00e8s fond\u00e9 sur des faits remontant d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e0 plus de deux ans et demi, validement convenir, comme mesure conservatoire, \u00e0 ce que la cause proc\u00e8de \u00ab au m\u00eame effet que si le dossier \u00e9tait r\u00e9gulier et dans l'ordre \u00bb, la situation devant \u00eatre r\u00e9gularis\u00e9e par la suite par une reprise d'instance ayant cet effet, c'est-\u00e0-dire couvrant le changement d'\u00e9tat et la cessation de la tutelle de la demanderesse. Les dispositions des arts. 269 et 270 du Code de Proc\u00e9dure Civile ne pouvaient faire obstacle \u00e0 cette entente. Ces articles prescrivent que toute proc\u00e9dure faite subs\u00e9quemment \u00e0 la notification de la cessation des fonctions dans lesquelles proc\u00e8de une des parties est nulle et que l'instance est suspendue jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'elle soit reprise par une personne habilit\u00e9e \u00e0 ce faire. Mais la nullit\u00e9 d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9e par l'art. 269 C.P.C. n'est pas une nullit\u00e9 absolue mais une nullit\u00e9 relative qui ne peut \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9e que par ceux dont les int\u00e9r\u00eats ne sont pas repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s. M. Boncenne et Bourbeau, Proc\u00e9dure Civile, tome 5, p. 193; Lowrey et al. v. Routh[4]. Aussi bien, les parties \u00e0 l'entente\u2014l'intim\u00e9e, agissant \u00e0 titre de g\u00e9rant d'affaires pour prot\u00e9ger les int\u00e9r\u00eats des mineurs, et l'appelant agissant personnellement\u2014pouvaient, par un consentement mutuel motiv\u00e9 par leurs obligations ou leurs int\u00e9r\u00eats, validement former vis-\u00e0-vis la Cour ce contrat judiciaire.\nDans le cas qui nous occupe, ce contrat judiciaire est, \u00e0 mon avis, le fait juridique dominant. Sans doute \u00e9tait-il implicite qu'en ex\u00e9cution de cette entente, la r\u00e9gularisation du dossier se ferait avant que jugement ne soit rendu. En fait, on \u00e0 proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 ce faire, mais d'une fa\u00e7on incompl\u00e8te et ce par suite d'un oubli qui \u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 subs\u00e9quemment r\u00e9par\u00e9. Cet oubli commun \u00e0 tous n'entra\u00eene pas, cependant, la disparition de l'entente et de ses cons\u00e9quences. Dans son essence, ce contrat judiciaire avait pour cause et objet v\u00e9ritables d'\u00e9carter toute objection bas\u00e9e sur le remariage de l'intim\u00e9e et de proc\u00e9der avec la cause au m\u00eame effet que si les parties \u00e9taient r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement devant le tribunal. Domini litis, les parties au litige ont manifestement voulu faire porter le d\u00e9bat uniquement sur le m\u00e9rite de la r\u00e9clamation de l'intim\u00e9e et de celle des mineurs. Elles sont maintenant li\u00e9es par la m\u00e9thode qu'elles ont mutuellement adopt\u00e9e pour la conduite du proc\u00e8s. The Century Indemnity Company v. Rogers[5]; Sullivan v. McGillis et al[6]. et City of Verdun v. Sun Oil Company Limited[7].\nEn somme, je ne verrais aucun obstacle \u00e0 tenir comme valide et conforme au contrat judiciaire un consentement que l'appelant aurait pu donner en appel \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de l'intim\u00e9e; et, \u00e9galement, je suis d'avis que la Cour d'Appel ne pouvait faire droit \u00e0 l'objection qu'il fit \u00e0 cette requ\u00eate sans mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 le contrat judiciaire consenti par l'appelant. Comme la Cour d'Appel, je rejetterais cette objection.\nAvant de clore sur cette question, je dois ajouter que la d\u00e9cision du Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans Levine v. Serling[8], cit\u00e9e par l'appelant, n'est d'aucune assistance en l'esp\u00e8ce. Les circonstances en cette affaire sont fondamentalement diff\u00e9rentes de celles pr\u00e9valant en la pr\u00e9sente cause. Il s'agissait l\u00e0 d'une action dirig\u00e9e contre un mineur dont l'incapacit\u00e9 de plaider avait \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e aux plaidoiries et l'action fut d\u00e9clar\u00e9e nulle ab initio.\nPour ces raisons, je rejetterais l'appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppel rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nProcureurs du d\u00e9fendeur, appelant: Deslandes, Brodeur et D\u00e9ry, St-Hyacinthe.\nProcureurs de la demanderesse, intim\u00e9e: B\u00e9dard, Veilleux et Choquette, Qu\u00e9bec.\n[1] [1964] B.R. 301.\n[2] [1964] B.R. 301.\n[3] [1958] R.C.S. 377, 13 D.L.R. 273.\n[4] [1887] M.L.R. 3 Q.B. 364.\n[5] [1932] R.C.S. 529, 2 D.L.R. 582.\n[6] [1949] R.C.S. 201, 93 C.C.C. 175, 2 D.L.R. 305.\n[7] [1952] 1 R.C.S. 222, 1 D.L.R. 529.\n[8] [1914] A.C. 659, 23 B.R. 289, 16 R.P.Q. 73.",

All\u00e9guant que cet accident \u00e9tait d\u00fb uniquement \u00e0 la faute, n\u00e9gligence, imprudence et incurie de la cit\u00e9, la demanderesse poursuivit cette derni\u00e8re. Le verdict du jury fut \u00e0 I'effet que la cit\u00e9 \u00e9tait en faute et ce verdict fut confirm\u00e9 par le juge au proc\u00e8s. La Cour d'Appel rejeta l'action. La demanderesse en appela devant cette Cour.\nArr\u00eat: L'appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9.\nLe juge en chef Taschereau et les juges Fauteux et Abbott: II existe des doutes s\u00e9rieux sur la validit\u00e9 de l'avis donn\u00e9 \u00e0 la cit\u00e9 et exig\u00e9 par l'art. 535 de sa charte. Cet avis \u00e9tait vague et impr\u00e9cis, et sugg\u00e9rait \u00e0 la cit\u00e9 de s'adresser \u00e0 un certain constable pour obtenir tous les d\u00e9tails. La connaissance d'un accident que certains employ\u00e9s de la corporation peuvent acqu\u00e9rir individuellement ne peut remplacer l'avis exig\u00e9.\nInd\u00e9pendamment de cette technicalit\u00e9 l\u00e9gale, la demanderesse qui avait le fardeau de la preuve n'a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 \u00e9tablir la faute de la cit\u00e9 sous l'art. 1053 du Code civil. La ville n'est pas l'assureur de ceux qui se servent de ses trottoirs. II faut qu'il soit d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'il y a eu n\u00e9gligence de la part de la cit\u00e9 ou de ses employ\u00e9s, et que c'est de cette n\u00e9gligence que le dommage a r\u00e9sult\u00e9. L'art. 535A de la charte dispense la municipalit\u00e9 de toute responsabilit\u00e9 \u00e0 moins que le r\u00e9clamant n'\u00e9tablisse que l'accident a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 par la n\u00e9gligence ou faute de la municipalit\u00e9, le tribunal devant tenir compte des conditions climat\u00e9riques. Dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, cette faute n'existait pas. La cit\u00e9 a fait preuve de la diligence voulue. La preuve d\u00e9montre que les trottoirs \u00e0 cet endroit avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 sabl\u00e9s l\u00e0 o\u00f9 il y avait de la neige ou de la glace.\nLes juges Cartright et Hall: The notice given to the City did not comply with the requirements of s. 535 of the City Charter.\nAPPEL d'un jugement de la Cour du banc de la reine, province de Qu\u00e9bec[1], infirmant le jugement du juge Lizotte qui avait confirm\u00e9 le verdict du jury. Appel rejet\u00e9. Lawrence Corriveau, C.R., pour la demanderesse, appelante.\nJacques de Billy, C.R., pour la d\u00e9fenderesse, intim\u00e9e.\nLe jugement du juge en chef Taschereau et des juges Fauteux et Abbott fut rendu par\nLE JUGE EN CHEF:\u2014La demanderesse, domicili\u00e9e \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec, all\u00e8gue que le ou vers le 4 mars 1961, \u00e0 4 heures p.m., elle fut victime d'un accident qui lui a caus\u00e9 des blessures graves qu'elle a \u00e9valu\u00e9es \u00e0 la somme de $36,927.32, et qu'elle r\u00e9clame dans la pr\u00e9sente action.\nElle circulait, \u00e0 cette date, \u00e0 pied, sur le trottoir qui borde le c\u00f4t\u00e9 nord de la rue St-Jean, en front de l'h\u00f4tel Montcalm, et plus sp\u00e9cialement en son tron\u00e7on situ\u00e9 entre la rue d'Youville et la C\u00f4te des Glacis. Elle fit une chute sur un trottoir qu'elle pr\u00e9tend avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 couvert de glace, et qui pr\u00e9sentait de s\u00e9rieux dangers pour les pi\u00e9tons \u00e0 cet endroit. Cet accident, d'apr\u00e8s elle, serait d\u00fb uniquement \u00e0 la faute de la Cit\u00e9 d\u00e9fenderesse, \u00e0 sa n\u00e9gligence, son imprudence et son incurie.\nLa d\u00e9fenderesse aurait retard\u00e9 ou n\u00e9glig\u00e9 de voir \u00e0 ce que cette glace, qui se trouvait au moment pr\u00e9cis de l'accident \u00e0 cet endroit, fut enlev\u00e9e, ou encore que le passage des pi\u00e9tons puisse se faire sans aucun danger.\nLa cit\u00e9 fait reposer sa d\u00e9fense sur plusieurs points. En premier lieu, elle soutient que l'avis que la demanderesse est oblig\u00e9e de donner \u00e0 la Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec en vertu de la Charte (art. 535), est irr\u00e9gulier, ill\u00e9gal et nul et non conforme aux exigences de la loi. Elle plaide \u00e9galement que la demanderesse n'est pas tomb\u00e9e sur le trottoir, mais bien dans la rue, mais, qu'\u00e0 tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, qu'elle soit tomb\u00e9e dans la rue ou sur le trottoir, il n'y avait ni neige ni glace et l'asphalte \u00e9tait s\u00e8che ainsi qu'elle l'aurait admis elle-m\u00eame apr\u00e8s l'accident. Enfin, la d\u00e9fenderesse all\u00e8gue que le trottoir et la rue avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 parfaitement entretenus, \u00e9taient en tr\u00e8s bon \u00e9tat, nullement dangereux, et que du sable avait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9pandu, et que si la demanderesse est tomb\u00e9e et a subi l'accident dont elle se plaint, cela ne peut \u00eatre d\u00fb qu'\u00e0 sa propre faute, sa n\u00e9gligence, son imprudence. La d\u00e9fenderesse ajoute \u00e9galement que m\u00eame si le trottoir ou la rue avaient pu \u00eatre glissants, ce qui est express\u00e9ment ni\u00e9, cela n'aurait pu d\u00e9pendre que de circonstances absolument en dehors du contr\u00f4le de la d\u00e9fenderesse, qu'elle ne pouvait emp\u00eacher malgr\u00e9 toutes les pr\u00e9cautions qu'elle pouvait prendre. Les dommages, enfin, seraient exag\u00e9r\u00e9s et la demanderesse n'aurait pas subi, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 la chute qu'elle a faite, des blessures aussi s\u00e9rieuses qu'elle all\u00e8gue.\nJ'entretiens des doutes s\u00e9rieux sur la validit\u00e9 de l'avis donn\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cit\u00e9 d\u00e9fenderesse, et exig\u00e9 par l'art. 535 de la Charte. Cet avis est n\u00e9cessaire pour que prenne naissance le droit d'action, et s'il est insuffisamment libell\u00e9, s'il ne fournit pas \u00e0 la Ville les informations n\u00e9cessaires sur la nature de l'accident, le d\u00e9tail des dommages soufferts, la cause de ces dommages, l'endroit o\u00f9 ils sont arriv\u00e9s, la condition pr\u00e9alable et essentielle \u00e0 l'existence du droit d'action est absente, et la r\u00e9clamation ne peut r\u00e9ussir. Baribeau v. Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec[2].\nL'avis donn\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec, et adress\u00e9 au Chef du Contentieux, est vague et impr\u00e9cis, et sugg\u00e8re \u00e0 ville, pour obtenir tous les d\u00e9tails, de s'adresser au constable Chamberland qui est arriv\u00e9 sur les lieux quelques instants apr\u00e8s la chute de la victime.\nLa connaissance de l'accident que certains employ\u00e9s de la corporation ont pu acqu\u00e9rir individuellement ne peut remplacer l'avis exig\u00e9 par la Charte. Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al v. Bradley[3].\nDans une cause de Jobin v. Thetford Mines[4], M. le Juge Anglin disait:\nThe purpose of the notice was to give the municipal corporation such knowledge of the claim in respect of which it was given as would enable it to make the necessary inquiries to ascertain, within a reasonable time after the claim arose, the basis of it, and the material facts and circumstances affecting the Corporation's liability.\nDans Montreal Street Railway v. Patenaude[5], la Cour du Banc du Roi a dit:\nIl est maintenant de jurisprudence que l'action ne peut \u00eatre port\u00e9e que si l'avis a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 au pr\u00e9alable, tel que prescrit, et que sans cet avis le droit de r\u00e9clamer en justice n'existe pas. Enfin, dans la cause de La Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec v. Baribeau, supra., M. le Juge Rinfret, parlant pour la Cour, s'exprimait de la fa\u00e7on suivante:\nCette exigence de la loi, par exemple, ne peut \u00eatre mise de c\u00f4t\u00e9 sous pr\u00e9texte d'absence de pr\u00e9judice. Le texte de l'article 535 ne permet pas d'introduire ce correctif (Carmichael v. City of Edmonton (1933) R.C.S. 650). En particulier, la connaissance de l'accident que certains employ\u00e9s ou certains officiers de la corporation ont pu acqu\u00e9rir individuellement ne peut remplacer l'avis exig\u00e9 par la charte (Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al v. Bradley (1927) R.C.S. 279, \u00e0 283). L'absence de pr\u00e9judice ou la connaissance des faits par les employ\u00e9s ou les officiers de la cit\u00e9 ne peut \u00eatre d'un certain poids que dans la question de savoir si un avis qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7u dans les d\u00e9lais contient les d\u00e9tails ou les indications suffisantes.\nDevant cette jurisprudence, il est difficile d'entretenir de s\u00e9rieuses h\u00e9sitations, mais je ne d\u00e9sire pas faire reposer mon jugement sur cette technicalit\u00e9 l\u00e9gale. \u00c9videmment, cette action ne peut r\u00e9ussir que si toutes les conditions de l'article 1053 trouvent leur application. La demanderesse a fardeau de la preuve et doit \u00e9tablir la faute de l'intim\u00e9e, et il est bon de ne pas oublier qu'il n'existe pas de pr\u00e9somption l\u00e9gale contre la Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec.\nComme j'ai eu l'occasion de la dire d\u00e9j\u00e0, et trop de pi\u00e9tons croient le contraire, la Ville n'est pas l'assureur de ceux qui se servent de ses trottoirs. Le fait de faire une chute sur un trottoir ne donne pas n\u00e9cessairement ouverture \u00e0 une r\u00e9clamation pour les dommages subis. II faut n\u00e9cessairement \u00e9tablir la faute de la cit\u00e9. La Commission des Accidents du Travail de Qu\u00e9bec v. La Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec[6].\nII faut qu'il soit d\u00e9montr\u00e9 par la balance des probabilit\u00e9s qu'il y a eu n\u00e9gligence de la part de la cit\u00e9 ou de ses employ\u00e9s, et que c'est de cette n\u00e9gligence que le dommage a r\u00e9sult\u00e9. Ce que l'on exige des municipalit\u00e9s ce n'est pas un standard de perfection. Paquin v. La Cit\u00e9 de Verdun[7]. On ne peut demander aux villes de pr\u00e9voir l'incertitude des \u00e9l\u00e9ments, et la vigilance simultan\u00e9e de tous les moments dans tous les endroits de leur territoire serait leur imposer une obligation d\u00e9raisonnable. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 dit dans la cause de Paquin v. La Cit\u00e9 de Verdun, supra, il peut arriver, et il arrive malheureusement des accidents, o\u00f9 s'exerce cependant tr\u00e8s bien la surveillance municipale, et qui r\u00e9sultent d'aucune n\u00e9gligence et pour lesquels il n'y a pas de compensation sanctionn\u00e9e par la loi civile. Garberi v. Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al[8].\nEn 1937, le caract\u00e8re de la responsabilit\u00e9 en cette mati\u00e8re a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 par la disposition suivante:\n535a) Nonobstant toute loi g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ou sp\u00e9ciale, la cit\u00e9 ne peut \u00eatre tenue responsable des dommages r\u00e9sultant d'un accident dont une personne est victime sur les trottoirs, rues ou chemins, en raison de la neige ou de la glace, \u00e0 moins que le r\u00e9clamant n'\u00e9tablisse que ledit accident a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 par n\u00e9gligence ou faute de ladite corporation, le tribunal devant tenir compte des conditions climat\u00e9riques. (1 Geo. VI, c. 102, art. 76).\nCette disposition l\u00e9gale est empreinte du bon sens le plus \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire, et refl\u00e8te bien l'id\u00e9e du l\u00e9gislateur qui ne veut pas imposer une charge trop on\u00e9reuse aux municipalit\u00e9s. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 dit d\u00e9j\u00e0, la Cit\u00e9 n'est pas tenue d'assurer que ses rues et trottoirs ne seraient jamais glissants; elle est seulement oblig\u00e9e de prendre les pr\u00e9cautions que prendrait un homme diligent pour atteindre ce but. La seule responsabilit\u00e9 de la municipalit\u00e9 existe lorsque l'\u00e9tat du trottoir, s'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 la cause d'un dommage, a \u00e9t\u00e9 le r\u00e9sultat d'une faute que la victime doit \u00e9tablir.\nDans le cas qui nous occupe, je ne vois pas l'existence de cette faute g\u00e9n\u00e9ratrice de la responsabilit\u00e9 de la Cit\u00e9 d\u00e9fenderesse. Au moment de l'accident, une grande surface des trottoirs \u00e9tait libre de neige et de glace. Le temps \u00e9tait beau, c'\u00e9tait une journ\u00e9e ensoleill\u00e9e. Au cours de la matin\u00e9e, les trottoirs de la rue St-Jean ont \u00e9t\u00e9 sabl\u00e9s partout o\u00f9 il y avait de la neige ou de la glace. La temp\u00e9rature de cette journ\u00e9e du 4 mars, \u00e0 l'Ancienne Lorette, tel que prouv\u00e9 par le Service de m\u00e9t\u00e9rologie du minist\u00e8re des Transports du Canada, \u00e9tait la suivante: \u00e0 8 heures du matin, 22\u00b0; \u00e0 9 heures, 24\u00b0; \u00e0 10 heures, 25\u00b0; \u00e0 11 heures, 27\u00b0; \u00e0 midi, 29\u00b0; \u00e0 1 heure, 31\u00b0; \u00e0 2 heures, 33\u00b0; \u00e0 3 heures, 33\u00b0; \u00e0 4 heures, 31\u00b0 et \u00e0 5 heures, 29\u00b0.\nII a cependant \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli qu'entre l'Ancienne Lorette et la Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec il y a une diff\u00e9rence d'environ 5 degr\u00e9s dans la temp\u00e9rature, de sorte qu'\u00e0 4 heures, c'est-\u00e0-dire au moment o\u00f9 l'accident est arriv\u00e9 la temp\u00e9rature au Carr\u00e9 d'Youville \u00e9tait de 36\u00b0.\nII peut arriver \u00e9videmment qu'entre le temps o\u00f9 le sable a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 le matin et le temps o\u00f9 l'accident est arriv\u00e9, une l\u00e9g\u00e8re couche de glace se soit form\u00e9e. II est \u00e9galement possible que la neige ou la glace fondante ait entra\u00een\u00e9 le sable et y ait laiss\u00e9 une surface glissante. Mais cela ne constitue pas une n\u00e9gligence qui entra\u00eene la responsabilit\u00e9 de la ville. Celle-ci n'est pas tenue, quand elle doit surveiller 100 milles de trottoirs, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 les conditions climat\u00e9riques du 4 mars, de faire plus que ce qu'elle a fait. Je crois que la Cit\u00e9 a fait preuve de la diligence voulue. Comme le dit M. le Juge Badeaux de la Cour d'Appel: \u00ab L'on ne peut exiger de l'appelante qu'elle prot\u00e8ge chaque pouce et chaque pied de ses trottoirs \u00e0 chaque instant, surtout dans une ville de l'importance de la Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec. \u00bb\nJe n'oublie pas qu'il s'agit d'un proc\u00e8s devant un juge et des jur\u00e9s, et qu'il est tr\u00e8s difficile pour cette Cour d'intervenir sur les questions de faits. J'admets donc, malgr\u00e9 que la preuve soit contradictoire, qu'il y avait de la glace \u00e0 l'endroit o\u00f9 est tomb\u00e9e la victime (418 C.P.C.) Mais, o\u00f9 ce proc\u00e8s est entach\u00e9 d'erreur, c'est, lorsque r\u00e9pondant aux questions suivantes:\nQ. Si la demanderesse a subi des dommages, est-prouv\u00e9 que l'accident a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 par n\u00e9gligence ou faute de la demanderesse, Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec?\nR. Douze\u2014oui.\nQ. Si oui, dire en quoi consiste cette n\u00e9gligence ou faute.\nR. Une surface glac\u00e9e tr\u00e8s glissante; application de sable non suffisante pour cette partie tr\u00e8s achaland\u00e9e de la ville.\nQ. Combien?\nR. Douze.\nles r\u00e9ponses ci-dessus ont \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9es.\nCes r\u00e9ponses donn\u00e9es par le jury \u00e9l\u00e8vent, comme on peut le voir, le standard de pr\u00e9caution \u00e0 un degr\u00e9 sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 celui requis par la loi. On voudrait que les rues soient sabl\u00e9es \u00e0 chaque fois que se pr\u00e9sente un changement de temp\u00e9rature. Ceci est une erreur et n'est pas la loi de la province. La Cour d'Appel[9] \u00e9tait donc justifi\u00e9e de dire, comme elle l'a dit, que le juge pr\u00e9sidant au proc\u00e8s aurait d\u00fb accorder la motion orale de l'appelante pour retirer la cause du jury, qu'il a err\u00e9 en ne l'accordant pas, et en refusant de rejeter l'action de l'intim\u00e9e et en confirmant le verdict du jury.\nCette conclusion \u00e0 laquelle j'arrive me dispense d'examiner les autres aspects de cette cause. Je rejetterais donc l'appel avec d\u00e9pens de toutes les Cours.\nLe jugement des Juges Cartwright et Hall fut rendu par HALL J.:\u2014The facts are full set out in the judgment of the Chief Justice. I agree that the appeal must be dismissed but solely on the ground that the notice which the appellant gave to the respondent on March 10, 1961, in purported compliance with art. 535 of the Charter of the City of Quebec did not comply with the requirements of art. 535. In this regard I agree with Taschereau J. in the Court of Queen's Bench and I do not find it necessary to add anything to what he said in his reasons for judgment on this point.\nThe appeal should accordingly be dismissed with costs.\nAppel rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nProcureur de la demanderesse, appelante: L.

Cette op\u00e9ration requ\u00e9rait le remplissage de deux r\u00e9servoirs. Le remplissage du r\u00e9servoir n\u00b0 1 fut fait avec un boyau auquel \u00e9tait attach\u00e9 un joint automatique, connu sous le nom de \"fast filling\", qui ne permettait pas \u00e0 un surplus de gasoline de p\u00e9n\u00e9trer dans le r\u00e9servoir. Le boyau destin\u00e9 \u00e0 remplir le r\u00e9servoir n\u00b0 2 n'\u00e9tait pas \u00e9quip\u00e9 de ce joint automatique et pouvait permettre \u00e0 un surplus de gasoline de p\u00e9n\u00e9trer dans le r\u00e9servoir \u00e0 moins que ne se pr\u00e9sente I'intervention d'une personne pour discontinuer son op\u00e9ration.

On \u00e9valua la quantit\u00e9 de gasoline ainsi entr\u00e9e dans la cave entre 50 et 75 gallons. Cette gasoline occasionna la mise en op\u00e9ration d'une pompe automatique \u00e9lectrique; une \u00e9tincelle s'est produite qui provoqua une explosion.

L'explosion dans le cas pr\u00e9sent a r\u00e9sult\u00e9 de la faute unique du pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 de la d\u00e9fenderesse et les causes de cette explosion furent le renversement de l'essence et le d\u00e9faut de fermer la soupage des r\u00e9servoirs.

La Cour d'Appel[2] a confirm\u00e9 ces jugements en vertu desquels Imperial Oil Limited a \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9e \u00e0 payer les montants suivants:\nJean-Louis Nadeau\n$45,000\nFederated Mutual Implement & Hardware Insurance Co\n60,000\nRen\u00e9 Nadeau\n23,000\nL\u00e9o Boisclair\n9,000\nTous ces montants sont suffisants pour donner juridiction \u00e0 la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada d'entendre le pr\u00e9sent appel, mais, en ce qui concerne L\u00e9o Boisclair, comme il ne s'agit que d'un montant de $9,000, une permission sp\u00e9ciale d'appeler a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e \u00e0 Imperial Oil Limited.\nLes faits sont les suivants: Le 6 janvier 1959, un camion-citerne, propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'appelante, et conduit par son employ\u00e9, Marcel Lefebvre, a livr\u00e9 de la gazoline au garage Nadeau, \u00e0 Pierreville, dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec. A son arriv\u00e9e au garage, Lefebvre a mesur\u00e9 le nombre de gallons de gazoline qui \u00e9taient contenus dans les r\u00e9servoirs du garage, et il trouva que dans les r\u00e9servoirs nos 1 et 2 il pouvait livrer 2,500 gallons de gazoline nouvelle.\nLe remplissage n\u00b0 1 du garage fut fait avec un boyau auquel \u00e9tait attach\u00e9 un joint automatique, connu sous le nom de \"fast filling\", qui ne permettait pas \u00e0 un surplus de gazoline de p\u00e9n\u00e9trer dans le r\u00e9servoir. Le boyau destin\u00e9 \u00e0 remplir le r\u00e9servoir n\u00b0 2 du garage \u00e9tait \u00e9quip\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on diff\u00e9rente. II n'y avait pas de \"fast filling joint\" et pouvait permettre \u00e0 un surplus de gazoline de p\u00e9n\u00e9trer dans le r\u00e9servoir, dans certains cas, \u00e0 moins que ne se pr\u00e9sente l'intervention d'une personne pour discontinuer son op\u00e9ration. A un certain moment, pendant que le r\u00e9servoir n\u00b0 1 recevait la gazoline venant du camion, la gazoline destin\u00e9e au r\u00e9servoir n\u00b0 2 a refoul\u00e9 et s'est r\u00e9pandue dans la neige qui se trouvait dans les environs, \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 du garage, et a \u00e9videmment p\u00e9n\u00e9tr\u00e9 dans la cave du garage o\u00f9 une explosion s'est produite. On \u00e9value la quantit\u00e9 de gazoline ainsi entr\u00e9e dans la cave entre 50 et 75 gallons.\nCette quantit\u00e9 de gazoline qui s'est ainsi r\u00e9pandue occasionna la mise en op\u00e9ration d'une pompe automatique situ\u00e9e dans un puits pratiqu\u00e9 dans le plancher. Cette pompe servait \u00e0 d\u00e9verser l'eau qui pouvait, \u00e0 l'occasion, p\u00e9n\u00e9trer dans la cave, et, \u00e9videmment, dans ce puits s'est infiltr\u00e9e la gazoline qui s'est \u00e9chapp\u00e9e. Lorsque la pompe \u00e9lectrique, \u00e0 cause de l'infiltration de cette gazoline et l'\u00e9l\u00e8vement du niveau liquide dans le puits, s'est mise \u00e0 fonctionner automatiquement, une \u00e9tincelle s'est produite et c'est ce qui provoqua apparemment une explosion et causa les dommages mentionn\u00e9s ci-dessus et qui ne sont pas contest\u00e9s.\nL'honorable Juge Cousineau, qui a entendu la cause en premi\u00e8re instance, est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la conclusion que le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 de l'appelante, Lefebvre, s'est tromp\u00e9 quand il a mesur\u00e9 quelle quantit\u00e9 additionnelle d'essence le r\u00e9servoir pourrait contenir. Comme il l'a dit lui-m\u00eame dans son t\u00e9moignage:\nQ. Le r\u00e9servoir n\u00b0 2, dans votre opinion, il s'est rempli?\nR. Oui, pour que \u00e7a renverse il faut qu'il soit rempli. II renversait parce qu'il \u00e9tait trop plein.\nCeci est la premi\u00e8re faute que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a retenue pour \u00e9tablir la responsabilit\u00e9 de l'appelante, et, en second lieu, le juge ajoute que Lefebvre n'\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9s des valves de son camion au moment o\u00f9 la gazoline a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 se d\u00e9verser.\nLe Cour d'Appel n'a pas trouv\u00e9 que Lefebvre s'\u00e9tait tromp\u00e9 en prenant les mesures, mais a \u00e9t\u00e9 d'avis, avec le juge au proc\u00e8s, que Lefebvre aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre en position de fermer imm\u00e9diatement les valves quand le surplus s'est d\u00e9vers\u00e9 dans la neige, et a p\u00e9n\u00e9tr\u00e9 dans le sous-sol du garage. Je n'ai pas d'h\u00e9sitation \u00e0 retenir l'imprudence de Lefebvre. Et, parce qu'il \u00e9tait dans l'exercice de ses fonctions, sa n\u00e9gligence entra\u00eene la responsabilit\u00e9 de l'appelante.\nII est \u00e9vident que les employ\u00e9s des compagnies d'huile, qui livrent ainsi de l'essence \u00e0 leurs clients, doivent \u00eatre vigilants, attentifs et exercer une prudence qui \u00e9limine autant que possible tout risque d'accident comme celui qui s'est produit dans le cas qui nous occupe. La Cour a \u00e9t\u00e9 saisie \u00e0 maintes reprises de causes de cette nature et la r\u00e8gle est toujours demeur\u00e9e invariable. Ainsi, dans Larocque v. C\u00f4t\u00e9[3] , cette Cour a confirm\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision de la Cour du banc, de la Reine[4] , o\u00f9 l'honorable Juge Owen s'exprimait de la fa\u00e7on suivante:\nIn my opinion the ordinary rule of prudence required that Larocque (le livreur) remain at the connection to watch that the delivery proceeded normally and in the event of any blockage or overflow to be in a position to close the valve promptly. Larocque's failure to stay at the valve during delivery constituted negligence.\nAinsi, \u00e9galement, dans une cause assez r\u00e9cente, The Great Eastern Oil and Import Co., Ltd. v. Frederick Best Motor Assessories Co., Ltd.[5] , (1962) R.C.S. 118, cette Cour a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que le livreur d'huile ne demeurant pas aupr\u00e8s du tuyau des r\u00e9servoirs et de la soupape du boyau conduisant au camion-citerne constituait une n\u00e9gligence. Les faits de cette cause sont tr\u00e8s identiques \u00e0 ceux du pr\u00e9sent litige.\nJe ne vois aucune raison de d\u00e9cider autrement. Je pense que l'explosion a r\u00e9sult\u00e9 de la faute unique du pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 de la d\u00e9fenderesse-appelante et que les causes de cette explosion, qui a caus\u00e9 les dommages r\u00e9clam\u00e9s, sont le renversement de l'essence et le d\u00e9faut de fermer la soupape des r\u00e9servoirs.\nII s'agit d'une question de faits. Le juge au proc\u00e8s et la Cour d'Appel unanimement ont trouv\u00e9 qu'il y a eu n\u00e9gligence de la part de Lefebvre et je ne vois pas comment cette Cour peut intervenir. Je ne trouve rien dans la preuve qui pourrait justifier l'argument de l'appelante que le lien de causalit\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 bris\u00e9 par l'inaction du demandeur Nadeau. Je suis d'opinion que les appels doivent \u00eatre rejet\u00e9s avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppels rejet\u00e9s avec d\u00e9pens.\nProcureurs de la d\u00e9fenderesse, appelante: Tansey, de Grandpr\u00e9, de Grandpr\u00e9, Bergeron & Monet, Montr\u00e9al.\nProcureurs des demandeurs, intim\u00e9s, J.

II, c. 62\u2014Acte de l'Am\u00e9rique du Nord britannique, 1867 , c. 3, art. 96. Le 22 mai 1963, la l\u00e9gislature du Qu\u00e9bec adoptait la Loi concernant la juridiction de la Cour de Magistrat, 11-12 Eliz. II, c. 62, dont l'objet \u00e9tait de porter de $200 \u00e0 $500 la limite p\u00e9cuniaire de la juridiction de cette Cour. Par un arr\u00eat\u00e9-en-conseil en date du 22 janvier 1964, le lieutenant-gouverneur ordonna que soit soumise \u00e0 la Cour du banc de la reine, juridiction d'appel, la question de savoir si cette loi \u00e9tait inconstitutionnelle en tout ou en partie. La Cour d'Appel exprima l'avis que la Cour de Magistrat, avec toute la juridiction qui lui est conf\u00e9r\u00e9e non pas seulement par la loi sous \u00e9tude mais par toutes les lois pr\u00e9sentement en vigueur, avait chang\u00e9 de caract\u00e8re et \u00e9tait devenue une Cour vis\u00e9e par l'art. 96 de l'Acte de l'Am\u00e9rique du Nord britannique. La Cour d'Appel adjugea que vu que les magistrats n'\u00e9taient pas nomm\u00e9s conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'art. 96, la loi sous \u00e9tude \u00e9tait alors inconstitutionnelle. Le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la province en appela devant cette Cour.\nArr\u00eat: La Loi concernant la juridiction de la Cour de Magistrat, 11-12 Eliz. II, c. 62, n'est pas inconstitutionnelle.\nLa juridiction de la Cour d'Appel ainsi que la juridiction de cette Cour \u00e9taient d\u00e9limit\u00e9es par la question telle que pos\u00e9e par l'arr\u00eat\u00e9-en-conseil et la Cour d'Appel devait s'en tenir \u00e0 la question sp\u00e9cifique sur laquelle son avis avait \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9. Dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, l'avis recherch\u00e9 par le Conseil ex\u00e9cutif ne visait d'autre loi que la loi qui \u00e9tait sp\u00e9cifiquement mentionn\u00e9e et n'avait d'autre fin que celle de savoir si, en raison du changement de la limite p\u00e9cuniaire, cette loi \u00e9tait inconstitutionnelle. On ne peut trouver dans l'arr\u00eat\u00e9-en-conseil aucune intention expresse ou implicite de livrer indirectement \u00e0 l'examen des tribunaux les diverses lois de la province attribuant une comp\u00e9tence \u00e0 la Cour de Magistrat pr\u00e9sid\u00e9e par des juges nomm\u00e9s par le lieutenant-gouverneur-en-conseil. L'unique point que soul\u00e8ve la question se r\u00e9sume \u00e0 savoir si le fait d'augmenter de $200 \u00e0 $500 la limite p\u00e9cuniaire de la juridiction de la Cour de Magistrat \u00e9tait un fait qui, en soi et sans plus, \u00e9tait apte \u00e0 changer le caract\u00e8re de cette Cour pour en faire une Cour au sens de l'art. 96 ou analogue \u00e0 celles qui y sont mentionn\u00e9es. Une Cour inf\u00e9rieure validement constitu\u00e9e et non vis\u00e9e par l'art. 96 ne perd pas son caract\u00e8re initial du fait que par une l\u00e9gislation provinciale on pr\u00e9tend lui conf\u00e9rer une juridiction qui est propre aux Cours vis\u00e9es par cet article. Une telle l\u00e9gislation est invalide; mais la Cour demeure et retient son statut de Cour inf\u00e9rieure \u00e9chappant aux dispositions de l'art. 96. En l'esp\u00e8ce, l'extension, par l'augmentation du nombre de dollars, de cette juridiction de la Cour de Magistrat, consid\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la valeur courante du dollar, n'a pas en soi pour effet, lorsque ajout\u00e9e \u00e0 la juridiction qui lui est propre comme Cour inf\u00e9rieure non vis\u00e9e par l'art. 96, de faire de cette Cour une Cour tombant sous cet article. II s'ensuit que la loi sous \u00e9tude n'\u00e9tait pas inconstitutionnelle.\nConstitutional law\u2014Magistrate's Court of Quebec\u2014Pecuniary limits raised from $200 to $500\u2014Constitutionality of an Act concerning the jurisdiction of the Magistrate's Court, 11-12 Eliz. 11, c. 62\u2014B.N.A. Act, 1867, c. 3, s. 96.\nOn May 22, 1963, the Quebec Legislature passed an Act concerning the jurisdiction of the Magistrate's Court, 11-12 Eliz. II, c. 62, whose object was to raise the pecuniary limits of the jurisdiction of that Court from $200 to $500. On January 22, 1964, by Order-in-Council, the Lieutenant-Governor ordered that the question as to whether that statute was unconstitutional in whole or in part be submitted to the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side. The Court of Appeal expressed the opinion that the Magistrate's Court, with all the jurisdiction which has been conferred upon it not only by the statute in question but also by all the statutes presently in force, had changed its character and had become a Court within the meaning of s. 96 of the B.N.A. Act. The Court of Appeal ruled that since the magistrates were not appointed pursuant to s. 96, the statute in question was therefore unconstitutional. The Attorney General of the province appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The Act concerning the jurisdiction of the Magistrate's Court, 11-12 Eliz. II, c. 62, was not unconstitutional.\nThe jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal as well as the jurisdiction of this Court were limited to the question submitted by the Order-in-Council, and the Court of Appeal should have dealt only with the specific question upon which its opinion was asked. In the present instance, the opinion sought by the Executive Council referred only to the statute which was specifically mentioned and had no other object than the one as to whether, in view of the change in the pecuniary limits, that statute was unconstitutional. There is no intention express or implicit in the Order-in-Council to place indirectly under the scrutiny of the Courts the numerous statutes of the province attributing a competence to the Magistrate's Court presided over by judges appointed by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council. The only issue raised is as to whether the changing of the pecuniary limits of the jurisdiction of the Magistrate's Court from $200 to $500 was a fact which, by itself and without more, was apt to change the character of that Court so as to make it a Court within the meaning of s. 96 or analogous to those therein mentioned. An inferior Court validly constituted and outside the scope of s. 96 does not lose its initial character because a provincial legislation purports to confer upon it a jurisdiction which is proper to the Courts within the scope of that section. Such a legislation is invalid; but the Court retains its status of inferior Court outside the provisions of s. 96. In this particular case, the extension of the jurisdiction of the Magistrate's Court, by the raising of the pecuniary limits, considered in the light of the value of the dollar, did not have by itself the effect, when added to its jurisdiction as an inferior Court outside s. 96, to make of that Court a Court within the scope of that section. It follows that the statute in question was not unconstitutional.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec[1] , on a reference by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council.

II, c. 62. L'objet de cette loi modifiant le Code de Proc\u00e9dure Civile est de porter de $200 \u00e0 $500 la limite p\u00e9cuniaire touchant la juridiction de cette Cour. La date d'entr\u00e9e en vigueur de cette loi demeure sujette \u00e0 d\u00e9termination par une proclamation du Lieutenant-Gouverneur en conseil.\nAvant que ne soit lanc\u00e9e cette proclamation, la l\u00e9gislature, ainsi qu'il appert du pr\u00e9ambule d'une autre loi sanctionn\u00e9e le m\u00eame jour, 11-12 Eliz. II, c. 61, consid\u00e9ra qu'il importait d'obtenir, par un renvoi \u00e0 la Cour d'Appel de la province susceptible d'appel au plus haut tribunal du pays, la certitude que la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de la loi concernant la juridiction de la Cour de Magistrat est indiscutable. Aussi bien l'art. 1 du c. 61 prescrit-il que:\n1.

D\u00e8s lors, il y avait danger que, personne n'argumentant la th\u00e8se oppos\u00e9e, la question ne soit pas \u00e9ventuellement port\u00e9e devant la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada. C'est dans ces circonstances, d\u00e9crites au factum du Barreau de la Province de Qu\u00e9bec, que le Conseil du Barreau d\u00e9cida d'intervenir pour soutenir, en Cour du banc de la reine, la th\u00e8se oppos\u00e9e \u00e0 celle d\u00e9fendue par l'appelant et le Procureur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada et ce, ajoute-t-on au factum, \u00ab non pas afin de combattre \u00e0 outrance une l\u00e9gislation que tous souhaitent voir entrer en vigueur le plus t\u00f4t possible, \u00bb mais afin d'assurer que tous les aspects du probl\u00e8me soient pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s et qu'\u00e9ventuellement la question soit port\u00e9e devant la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada.\nApr\u00e8s avoir entendu les arguments de part et d'autre et d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9, la Cour d'Appel[3] (M. le Juge en chef Tremblay, MM. les Juges Rinfret, Choquette, Montgomery et Rivard) exprima son avis dans les termes suivants:\nLa loi concernant le juridiction de la Cour de Magistrat, 11-12 Elizabeth II, chapitre 62, est inconstitutionnelle en autant que les juges de la Cour vis\u00e9e par cette loi ne sont pas nomm\u00e9s conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'article 96 de l'Acte de l'Am\u00e9rique Britannique du Nord.\nLe Procureur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la Province de Qu\u00e9bec en appelle maintenant \u00e0 cette Cour, ainsi que le permet l'art. 37 de la Loi sur la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada. Dans cet appel, le Procureur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada et celui de la Province de Saskatchewan sont intervenus pour soutenir la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de la loi en question alors que, toujours dans le m\u00eame esprit, le Barreau de la Province de Qu\u00e9bec est intervenu pour soumettre les arguments militant en faveur de la th\u00e8se oppos\u00e9e.\nIl convient de citer les articles de la loi dont la constitutionnalit\u00e9 fait l'objet de cette r\u00e9f\u00e9rence:\n1. L'article 54 du Code de proc\u00e9dure civile, remplac\u00e9 par l'article 12 de la loi 1-2 Elizabeth II, chapitre 18, est modifi\u00e9 en rempla\u00e7ant les paragraphes 1 et 4 par les suivants:\n\u00ab 1. De toute demande dans laquelle la somme demand\u00e9e ou la valeur de la chose r\u00e9clam\u00e9e est inf\u00e9rieure \u00e0 cinq cents dollars, sauf les demandes de pension alimentaire et celles r\u00e9serv\u00e9es \u00e0 la Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier du Canada; \u00bb\n\u00ab 4. De toute demande en r\u00e9siliation de bail lorsque le montant r\u00e9clam\u00e9 pour loyer et dommages n'atteint pas cinq cents dollars. \u00bb\n2. Le dit code est modifi\u00e9 en ins\u00e9rant, apr\u00e8s l'article 58, le suivant: \u00ab 58a. Sauf dans les causes o\u00f9 l'objet du litige est d'une valeur inf\u00e9rieure \u00e0 deux cents dollars, un juge de la Cour du banc de la reine peut, en la mani\u00e8re pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l'article 1211, accorder la permission d'interjeter appel de tout jugement final de la Cour de magistrat.\nCet appel est r\u00e9gi par toutes les dispositions relatives \u00e0 l'appel des jugements interlocutoires de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure.\nIl ne permet de soulever que les questions de droit qui peuvent \u00eatre d\u00e9cid\u00e9es au vu du jugement, des actes de proc\u00e9dure et des \u00e9crits vers\u00e9s au dossier. \u00bb\n3. Du consentement des parties, toute cause qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 intent\u00e9e devant la Cour sup\u00e9rieure avant l'entr\u00e9e en vigueur de la pr\u00e9sente loi et qui, par l'article 1, est maintenant de la comp\u00e9tence de la Cour de magistrat est d\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 cette Cour pour y \u00eatre instruite et jug\u00e9e, comme si elle y avait \u00e9t\u00e9 intent\u00e9e et tous les jugements interlocutoires y avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 rendus.\n4. La pr\u00e9sente loi entrera en vigueur \u00e0 la date qui sera fix\u00e9e par proclamation du lieutenant-gouverneur en conseil.\nEn somme, l'art. 1 porte de $200 \u00e0 $500 la limite p\u00e9cuniaire de la comp\u00e9tence de la Cour de Magistrat; l'art. 2 donne \u00e0 la Cour du banc de la reine une juridiction d'appel d'un jugement de la Cour de Magistrat, sauf dans le cas o\u00f9 la valeur de l'objet en litige est inf\u00e9rieure \u00e0 $200; l'art. 3 contient une disposition transitoire relative aux causes pendantes, et enfin, l'art. 4 statue sur la date d'entr\u00e9e en vigueur de la loi. Ainsi donc, c'est l'art. 1 qui d\u00e9nonce l'objet v\u00e9ritable de la loi et qui donne une raison d'\u00eatre aux autres articles. Seul \u00e0 modifier la comp\u00e9tence de la Cour de Magistrat, l'art. 1 est aussi le seul article de cette loi auquel peut vraiment se rapporter la question soumise par l'arr\u00eat\u00e9 en conseil.\nEn Cour d'Appel, cependant, on a jug\u00e9 que cette question soumise par le Lieutenant-Gouverneur en conseil n'est pas, comme l'ont pr\u00e9tendu l'appelant et le Procureur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, de savoir si le fait d'augmenter la juridiction de la Cour de Magistrat de $200 \u00e0 $500 a pour effet d'en faire une Cour vis\u00e9e par l'art. 96 de l'Acte de l'Am\u00e9rique du Nord Britannique, c'est-\u00e0-dire une Cour dont les Juges contrairement \u00e0 ce qui s'est fait jusqu'\u00e0 maintenant, doivent \u00eatre nomm\u00e9s par le Gouverneur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral en conseil. On a plut\u00f4t jug\u00e9 que la question, ainsi que l'a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 le Barreau de la Province de Qu\u00e9bec, est de savoir si la Cour de Magistrat, avec toute la juridiction qui lui est conf\u00e9r\u00e9e, non pas seulement par la loi sous \u00e9tude mais par toutes les lois pr\u00e9sentement en vigueur, est une Cour vis\u00e9e par l'art. 96. C'est donc en donnant \u00e0 la question soumise une interpr\u00e9tation extensive dont la validit\u00e9 est mise en question dans cet appel, et en faisant entrer particuli\u00e8rement dans la consid\u00e9ration de la question ainsi interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e l'historique de la Cour de Circuit et de la Cour de Magistrat, les nombreuses lois attribuant une comp\u00e9tence \u00e0 la Cour de Magistrat, la comparaison de cette Cour avec la Cour de Circuit et les \u00ab District and County Courts \u00bb mentionn\u00e9es en l'art. 96, qu'on est arrive \u00e0 former l'opinion que si, lors de son \u00e9tablissement en 1869, la Cour de Magistrat n'\u00e9tait pas une des Cours vis\u00e9es par l'art. 96, la l\u00e9gislature en a graduellement chang\u00e9 le caract\u00e8re, au cours des ann\u00e9es, au point d'en faire, \u00e9ventuellement et \u00e0 un moment qu'on ne peut d\u00e9terminer, une Cour vis\u00e9e par cet article, tout en retenant, par ailleurs, le contr\u00f4le sur la nomination de ses Juges. Et d\u00e8s lors, la Cour d'Appel a conclu que la loi sous \u00e9tude \u00ab \u00e9tait inconstitutionnelle en autant que les juges de la Cour vis\u00e9e par cette loi ne sont pas nomm\u00e9s conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'article 96 \u00bb.\nEn droit, il \u00e9tait parfaitement loisible au Lieutenant-Gouverneur en conseil de soumettre l'une ou l'autre des questions que la Cour d'Appel a ainsi mises en contraste pour ensuite \u00e9carter la premi\u00e8re et retenir la seconde comme \u00e9tant, \u00e0 ses vues, celle qui lui \u00e9tait r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e. En effet, l'art. 2 de la Loi concernant les questions soumises \u00e0 la Cour du banc de la reine par le Lieutenant-Gouverneur en conseil S.R.Q. 1941 c. 8, sur lequel se fonde le pouvoir du Lieutenant-Gouverneur en conseil de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer des questions \u00e0 la Cour d'Appel, \u00e9dicte que:\n2. Le Lieutenant-Gouverneur en conseil peut soumettre \u00e0 la Cour du banc du roi, juridiction d'appel, pour audition et examen, toute question quelconque qu'il juge \u00e0 propos, et, sur ce, la Cour les entend et les examine.\nLe Lieutenant-Gouverneur en conseil a donc l'exclusive et la plus grande discr\u00e9tion en ce qui concerne le choix et la d\u00e9finition des questions qu'il d\u00e9sire soumettre; et il s'ensuit que la d\u00e9cision qu'il prend \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard d\u00e9limite la juridiction de la Cour d'Appel aussi bien que la juridiction de cette Cour. Le judiciaire n'a pas la responsabilit\u00e9 de sonder les desseins de l'ex\u00e9cutif; il doit s'en tenir \u00e0 la question sp\u00e9cifique sur laquelle on requiert son avis. Il n'est pas sans \u00e0 propos de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer ici \u00e0 l'extrait suivant du jugement du Comit\u00e9 Judiciaire du Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans Lord's Day Alliance of Canada v. Attorney-General for Manitoba (Attorney General for Canada, Intervener)[4] qui appara\u00eet au bas de la page 226:\nThe Lieutenant-Governor in Council expresses a desire to be informed as to the legality of the excursions to which he refers only on the assumption that that Act has been made operative, and no question as to their legality apart from the Act is propounded. Their Lordships were, however, strongly urged by the appellants to deal with and dispose of the view that such excursions were lawful in Manitoba independently of the Act altogether\u2014a view expressed by some of the learned Judges of the Court of Appeal in this case and foreshadowed in an earlier decision of the same Court.\nTheir Lordships will refrain from taking this course, for one compelling reason, which they name out of several which would justify reserve in this matter.\nStatutes empowering the executive Government, whether of the Dominion of Canada or of a Canadian province, to obtain by direct request from the Court answers to questions both of fact and law, although intra vires of the respective Legislatures, impose a novel duty to be discharged, but not enlarged, by the Court. See Attorney-General for Ontario v. Attorney-General for Canada (28 The Times L.R., 446; (1912) A.C. 571). It is more than ordinarily expedient in the case of such references that a Court should refrain from dealing with questions other than those which on executive responsibility are in express terms referred to it, and their Lordships will here act upon that view.\nJe dirais donc, et ce avec le plus grand respect pour la Cour d'Appel, qu'\u00e0 mon avis, le texte des consid\u00e9rants sur lesquels se fonde l'ordonnance de l'arr\u00eat\u00e9 en conseil, aussi bien que le texte de la question d\u00e9finie en cette ordonnance manifestent que l'avis recherch\u00e9 par le conseil ex\u00e9cutif ne vise d'autre loi que la loi qui y est sp\u00e9cifiquement mentionn\u00e9e et n'a d'autre fin que celle de savoir si, en raison de l'objet qui lui est propre\u2014soit le changement de la limite p\u00e9cuniaire\u2014cette loi serait inconstitutionnelle en autant que les Juges de la Cour vis\u00e9e par cette loi ne sont pas nomm\u00e9s conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'art. 96 de l'Acte de l'Am\u00e9rique du Nord Britannique. Nulle part en l'arr\u00eat\u00e9 en conseil peut-on trouver, \u00e0 mon avis, une intention expresse ou implicite de la part du Conseil Ex\u00e9cutif de livrer indirectement \u00e0 l'examen des tribunaux, en bloc et sans les sp\u00e9cifier, pour en mettre la constitutionnalit\u00e9 en question, les diverses lois de la province attribuant une comp\u00e9tence \u00e0 la Cour de Magistrat pr\u00e9sid\u00e9e par des Juges nomm\u00e9s par le Lieutenant-Gouverneur en conseil. La nature et les dimensions d'une telle r\u00e9f\u00e9rence seraient pour le moins inusit\u00e9es et encore aurait-il fallu, si vraiment c'\u00e9tait l\u00e0 l'intention du Conseil Ex\u00e9cutif, que cette intention apparaisse clairement des termes de la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence. Mais, soumet-on, on ne peut pr\u00e9sumer que le Conseil Ex\u00e9cutif ait pos\u00e9 une question dont la r\u00e9ponse est \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire et tel serait le cas si on assigne \u00e0 la question la port\u00e9e que lui donne l'appelant. La facilit\u00e9 de la r\u00e9ponse ne justifie pas per se l'extension de la question au-del\u00e0 des termes de la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence; d'autant plus que la v\u00e9ritable raison de cette r\u00e9f\u00e9rence appara\u00eet du pr\u00e9ambule et de l'art. 1 de la Loi, 11-12 Eliz. II, c. 61, supra, et du texte de l'arr\u00eat\u00e9 en conseil. Ce que la l\u00e9gislature a voulu, c'est de conditionner la mise en vigueur de la loi sous \u00e9tude \u00e0 l'obtention d'un avis des tribunaux en affirmant la validit\u00e9, afin de pr\u00e9venir qu'une fois en force, la validit\u00e9 de cette loi soit mise en question et que, par suite, son op\u00e9ration et la bonne administration de la justice en soient g\u00ean\u00e9es. L'arr\u00eat\u00e9 en conseil donne effet \u00e0 cette intention de la l\u00e9gislature.\nEn terminant ces consid\u00e9rations sur la v\u00e9ritable port\u00e9e de la question soumise par le Conseil Ex\u00e9cutif, il convient d'ajouter qu'il se peut qu'avec toute la juridiction que lui conf\u00e8rent les lois provinciales, la Cour de Magistrat soit devenue une Cour au sens de ou analogue \u00e0 celles qui sont d\u00e9crites en l'art. 96 du statut imp\u00e9rial et que, par suite, la loi sous \u00e9tude soit ultra vires de la l\u00e9gislature en autant que les Juges de la Cour vis\u00e9e par cette loi ne sont pas nomm\u00e9s conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 cet article. Il se peut aussi qu'en raison de la mati\u00e8re sur laquelle elles conf\u00e8rent une juridiction \u00e0 la Cour de Magistrat, tel par exemple les injonctions, certaines de ces lois soient ultra vires de la l\u00e9gislature et ce toujours en autant que les Juges de la Cour vis\u00e9e par ces lois ne sont pas nomm\u00e9s conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'art. 96. Autant de questions non comprises dans le cadre de cette r\u00e9f\u00e9rence et auxquelles, en cons\u00e9quence, il ne nous est pas loisible de r\u00e9pondre en l'esp\u00e8ce.\nAu m\u00e9rite, l'unique point, que soul\u00e8ve la question ainsi replac\u00e9e dans les limites que lui assigne l'arr\u00eat\u00e9 en conseil, se r\u00e9sume \u00e0 savoir si le fait d'augmenter de $200 \u00e0 $500 la limite p\u00e9cuniaire de la juridiction de la Cour de Magistrats\u2014Cour qui \u00e9tait incontestablement une Cour \u00e9chappant aux dispositions de l'art. 96 lors de sa cr\u00e9ation en 1869 et qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme telle jusqu'\u00e0 ce jour\u2014est un fait qui, en soi et sans plus, soit apte \u00e0 changer le caract\u00e8re de cette Cour pour en faire une Cour au sens de l'art. 96 ou analogue \u00e0 celles qui y sont mentionn\u00e9es. C'est l\u00e0 l'un des aspects du probl\u00e8me classique n\u00e9 de la conjoncture des dispositions des arts. 92(14) et 96, qui accordent respectivement, d'une part, \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislature de la province la comp\u00e9tence l\u00e9gislative relativement \u00e0 l'administration de la justice dans la province, y compris la cr\u00e9ation, le maintien et l'organisation des tribunaux de justice pour la province, ayant juridiction civile et criminelle, et y compris aussi la proc\u00e9dure civile dans ces tribunaux, et, d'autre part, au Gouverneur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral, le droit de nommer les Juges des Cours Sup\u00e9rieures, de District et de Comt\u00e9, dans chaque province. Ce probl\u00e8me a \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9 par cette Cour dans Re Adoption Act[5]. Et l'autorit\u00e9 de cette d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 maintes fois reconnue et nulle part en des termes plus positifs qu'au jugement du Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans Labour Relations Board of Saskatchewan v. John East Iron Works Ltd.[6] alors que, parlant au nom du Comit\u00e9 Judiciaire, Lord Simonds s'exprima comme suit \u00e0 la page 152:\nBut before parting with the case their Lordships think it proper to observe on two cases which have recently come before them, O. Martineau v. City of Montreal ((1932) A.C. 113) and Toronto Corporation v. York Corporation ((1938) A.C. 415), of which passing mention has already been made, and more particularly also upon Re Adoption Act of Ontario ((1938) S.C.R. (Can.) 398), in which will be found a judgment of Sir Lyman Duff, lately Chief Justice of Canada, so exhaustive and penetrating both in historical retrospect and in analysis of this topic, that their Lorships would respectfully adopt it as their own, so far as it is relevant to the present appeal.\nDans Re Adoption Act of Ontario, supra, on a jug\u00e9 que la juridiction des Cours inf\u00e9rieures, qu'il s'agisse de Cours vis\u00e9es ou non par l'art. 96, n'est pas \u00e0 jamais fig\u00e9e par l'Acte de l'Am\u00e9rique du Nord Britannique \u00e0 ce qu'elle \u00e9tait \u00e0 la date de la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration; que la pr\u00e9tention qu'une l\u00e9gislation provinciale est incompatible avec les dispositions de l'art. 96 si, sous quelque aspect que ce soit, cette l\u00e9gislation augmente la juridiction des Cours de juridiction sommaire existant \u00e0 la date de la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration est une pr\u00e9tention inadmissible en principe aussi bien qu'incompatible avec la pratique et les autorit\u00e9s depuis la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration; et, enfin, que l'augmentation de la limite p\u00e9cuniaire affectant la juridiction d'une de ces Cours inf\u00e9rieures n'a pas, en soi, pour effet de transformer le caract\u00e8re de cette Cour. Dans le cas qui nous occupe, la Cour d'Appel para\u00eet avoir accept\u00e9 comme pr\u00e9misse que la Cour de Magistrat, reconnue lors de son \u00e9tablissement en 1869 comme une Cour inf\u00e9rieure \u00e9chappant aux dispositions de l'art. 96, est devenue par suite d'une s\u00e9rie de lois provinciales, dont chacune en a \u00e9tendu la juridiction, une Cour au sens de ou analogue \u00e0 celles indiqu\u00e9es \u00e0 l'art. 96 dont les Juges doivent \u00eatre nomm\u00e9s par le Gouverneur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral. On a d\u00e8s lors conclu qu'une l\u00e9gislation qui \u00e9tend encore la juridiction d'une telle Cour, dont les Juges ne sont pas actuellement nomm\u00e9s par le Gouverneur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral, est inconstitutionnelle.\nEn toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, je dirais qu'\u00e0 mon avis une Cour inf\u00e9rieure validement constitu\u00e9e et non vis\u00e9e par l'art. 96 ne perd pas son caract\u00e8re initial du fait que par une l\u00e9gislation provinciale on pr\u00e9tend lui conf\u00e9rer une juridiction qui est propre aux Cours vis\u00e9es par cet article. Une telle l\u00e9gislation est invalide; mais la Cour demeure et retient son statut de Cour inf\u00e9rieure \u00e9chappant aux dispositions de l'art. 96.\nEn l'esp\u00e8ce, et \u00e0 cela se limite mon opinion, l'extension, par l'augmentation du nombre de dollars, de cette juridiction de la Cour de Magistrat, consid\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la valeur courante du dollar n'a pas en soi pour effet, lorsque ajout\u00e9e \u00e0 la juridiction qui lui est propre comme Cour inf\u00e9rieure non vis\u00e9e par l'art. 96, de faire de cette Cour une Cour tombant sous cet article. Il s'ensuit que la loi sous \u00e9tude n'est pas inconstitutionnelle. De cette conclusion, on ne doit pas inf\u00e9rer que je tienne comme constitutionnellement valides les diverses lois provinciales qui \u00e9tendent\u2014sauf par l'augmentation du nombre de dollars\u2014la juridiction de la Cour de Magistrat, lois que la Cour d'Appel a consid\u00e9r\u00e9es. Sur les opinions donn\u00e9es \u00e0 ce sujet en Cour d'Appel, je n'exprime ici aucune dissidence et aucun accord.\nJe maintiendrais l'appel, infirmerais le jugement de la Cour du banc de la reine, Division d'Appel, et r\u00e9pondant \u00e0 la question soumise par le Lieutenant-Gouverneur en conseil, je dirais que la Loi concernant la juridiction de la Cour de Magistrat, 11-12 Eliz. II, c. 62, n'est pas inconstitutionnelle.\nAppel maintenu.\n[1] [1965] B.R. 1.\n[2] [1965] B.R. 1.\n[3] [1965] B.R. 1.\n[4] (1924-25), 41 T.L.R. 225, [1925] A.C. 384.\n[5] [1938] S.C.R. 398, 71 C.C.C. 110, 3 D.L.R. 497.\n[6] [1949] A.C. 134.",

Il fut acquitt\u00e9 par le juge au proc\u00e8s pour les motifs qu'un conseiller l\u00e9gislatif n'\u00e9tait pas un fonctionnaire au sens de l'art. 102 du Code, et que m\u00eame s'il l'\u00e9tait, les actes qui lui \u00e9taient reproch\u00e9s n'avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9s par lui en sa qualit\u00e9 de conseiller l\u00e9gislatif. La Cour d'Appel rejeta ces deux motifs comme mal fond\u00e9s en droit et ordonna un nouveau proc\u00e8s. D'o\u00f9 le pourvoi de l'appelant devant cette Cour.\nArr\u00eat: L'appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9.\nLa Cour d'Appel a bien jug\u00e9 lorsqu'elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'un conseiller l\u00e9gislatif \u00e9tait un fonctionnaire au sens de l'art. 102 du Code Criminel. La Cour ne peut se substituer au parlement pour ajouter \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition de l'art. 99(e) (ii) du Code les mots \u00ab judiciaire ou minist\u00e9rielle \u00bb comme qualificatifs des expressions \u00ab fonction publique \u00bb. Il est douteux qu'en se servant du mot \u00ab nomm\u00e9e \u00bb le parlement ait eu l'intention d'attribuer \u00e0 ce mot, dans le contexte de l'art. 99, le sens purement juridique et strictement restreint ainsi que la port\u00e9e qu'il faudrait lui donner, si en fait\u2014ce qui n'est pas\u2014il apparaissait que le mot \u00ab nomm\u00e9e \u00bb est utilis\u00e9 en contraste avec le mot \u00ab \u00e9lue \u00bb. A tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement le conseiller l\u00e9gislatif est une personne nomm\u00e9e par le lieutenant-gouverneur. Les arts. 100 et 102 du Code envisagent des situations diff\u00e9rentes et rien ne s'oppose \u00e0 ce que, par sa conduite, un conseiller l\u00e9gislatif tombe sous l'un ou l'autre de ces deux articles.\nLa Cour d'Appel a bien jug\u00e9 lorsqu'elle a rejet\u00e9 la pr\u00e9tention que l'art. 102 ne s'applique au conseiller l\u00e9gislatif que dans le cas o\u00f9 les actes incriminants ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9s par lui en sa qualit\u00e9 officielle. On pourrait ajouter que dans ses termes, l'art. 102 n'exige pas, comme le fait l'art. 100, que l'acte incriminant soit pos\u00e9 en la qualit\u00e9 officielle de celui \u00e0 qui il est reproch\u00e9.\nIl n'y a pas lieu d'intervenir pour modifier l'ordonnance d'un nouveau proc\u00e8s rendue par la Cour d'Appel. Criminal law\u2014Member of Legislative Council\u2014Undue exercise of influence\u2014Whether legislative councillor an official\u2014Whether acts must be done in his capacity as legislative councillor\u2014Criminal Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 21, 99(e), 100, 102(1) (a) (ii) (iii), 592(4) (b), 597(2) (a).\nThe appellant, a member of the Legislative Council of the province of Quebec, was prosecuted on an indictment containing eleven counts charging him with having demanded, accepted, or offered, or agreed to accept a sum of money from a designated company for a designated person, contrary to the provisions of ss. 102(1) (a) (ii) (iii) and 21 of the Criminal Code. He was acquitted by the trial judge on the grounds that a legislative councillor is not an official within the meaning of s. 102 of the Code, and that even if he were, the transactions of which he was accused had not been made in his capacity as a legislative councillor. The Court of Appeal rejected these two grounds as ill-founded in law and ordered a new trial. The appellant appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe Court of Appeal was right in holding that a legislative councillor was an official within the meaning of s. 102 of the Criminal Code. The Court cannot substitute itself to Parliament in order to add to the definition in s. 99(e) (ii) of the Code the words \"judicial or ministerial\" so as to qualify the expression \"public duty\". It is doubtful that in using the word \"appointed\" Parliament had the intention to give to this word, in the context of s. 99, the purely juridical and strictly restricted sense as well as the scope which one would have to give to that word, if in fact\u2014which is not the case\u2014it appeared that the word \"appointed\" was used in contrast with the word \"elected\". In any event, the legislative councillor is a person appointed by the Lieutenant-Governor. Sections 100 and 102 of the Code contemplate different situations, and there is nothing to prevent a legislative councillor to come, by his conduct, under one or the other of these two sections.\nThe Court of Appeal was right in rejecting the contention that s. 102 applies to the legislative councillor only when the incriminating acts have been done by him in his official capacity. Furthermore, by its terms, s. 102 does not require, as s. 100 does, that the incriminating act be done in the official capacity of the person.\nThe order of a new trial made by the Court of Appeal should not be interfered with.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec, setting aside the appellant's acquittal and ordering a new trial.

Joseph Cohen, C.R., Fred Kaufman, D. Dionne et C. Rioux, pour l'appelant.\nLaurent E. B\u00e9langer, C.R., pour l'intim\u00e9e.\nLe jugement de la Cour fut rendu par\nLE JUGE FAUTEUX:\u2014Le 8 octobre 1963, le Juge G\u00e9rard Simard, de la Cour des Sessions de la Paix, condamnait l'appelant \u00e0 subir un proc\u00e8s sur un acte d'accusation contenant onze (11) chefs dont chacun l'accuse d'avoir, directement ou indirectement, dans le district de Qu\u00e9bec, entre le 1er janvier 1955 et le 30 juin 1960, \u00e9tant un fonctionnaire\u2014soit Conseiller L\u00e9gislatif pour la division des Laurentides et Lauzon, dans le Gouvernement de la Province de Qu\u00e9bec,\u2014exig\u00e9, accept\u00e9, ou offert, ou convenu d'accepter de la compagnie Peinture Sico Limit\u00e9e, pour une personne d\u00e9sign\u00e9e, une somme d'argent indiqu\u00e9e, en consid\u00e9ration d'une collaboration, d'une aide, d'un exercice d'influence ou d'un acte ou omission concernant la conclusion d'affaires avec le Gouvernement de la Province de Qu\u00e9bec ou au sujet d'affaires ayant trait audit Gouvernement, le tout contrairement aux dispositions des articles 102(1) (a) (ii) (iii) et 21 du Code Criminel.\nL'appelant fit option pour \u00eatre jug\u00e9 par un juge sans jury, et apr\u00e8s un long proc\u00e8s pr\u00e9sid\u00e9 par le Juge Albert Dumontier, de la Cour des Sessions de la Paix[1] , fut acquitt\u00e9 le 26 novembre 1964. Cet acquittement repose exclusivement sur deux motifs de droit. Aux vues du juge au proc\u00e8s un conseiller l\u00e9gislatif n'est pas un fonctionnaire au sens de l'art. 102 du Code Criminel et de plus, ajoute-t-il,\ncomme les d\u00e9marches que l'accus\u00e9 a entreprises aupr\u00e8s de la Compagnie 'La Peinture Sico Lt\u00e9e' d'une part, et le directeur des achats dans le gouvernement de la province de Qu\u00e9bec d'autre part, n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 faites en sa qualit\u00e9 de conseiller l\u00e9gislatif, les actes criminels contenus dans l'acte d'accusation ne pouvaient, en droit, lui \u00eatre reproch\u00e9s.\nEn somme, un conseiller l\u00e9gislatif ne serait pas un fonctionnaire au sens de l'art. 102 du Code Criminel, et m\u00eame s'il l'\u00e9tait, cet article, dit-on, ne peut s'appliquer que si les actes incriminants qui lui sont reproch\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9s par lui en sa qualit\u00e9 de conseiller l\u00e9gislatif.\nPort\u00e9 en appel, ce jugement fut infirm\u00e9 par une d\u00e9cision unanime de la Cour du banc de la reine. Dans leurs raisons de jugement MM. les Juges Casey et Brossard, avec l'accord de M. le Juge Pratte, rejettent comme mal fond\u00e9s en droit les deux motifs de droit sur lesquels se fonde l'acquittement de l'appelant. L'appel de la Couronne fut donc accueilli et le verdict d'acquittement fut \u00e9cart\u00e9. La Cour d'Appel ayant d\u00e8s lors \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer et d\u00e9cider, ainsi que l'exigent les dispositions de l'art. 592(4) (b) du Code Criminel, si elle devait consigner un verdict de culpabilit\u00e9 ou ordonner un nouveau proc\u00e8s, opta pour cette derni\u00e8re alternative.\nS'autorisant des dispositions de l'art. 597(2) (a) du Code Criminel l'appelant se pourvoit maintenant \u00e0 cette Cour pour faire r\u00e9tablir le jugement d'acquittement prononc\u00e9 en premi\u00e8re instance.\nSur le premier point de droit:\u2014Les dispositions pertinentes de l'art. 102 sur lesquelles reposent les accusations log\u00e9es contre l'appelant se lisent comme suit:\n102. (1) Commet une infraction, quiconque,\n(a) directement ou indirectement,\n(i)\n(ii) \u00e9tant fonctionnaire, exige, accepte ou offre ou convient d'accepter de quelqu'un pour lui-m\u00eame ou pour une autre personne,\nun pr\u00eat, une r\u00e9compense, un avantage ou un b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de quelque nature que ce soit en consid\u00e9ration d'une collaboration, d'une aide, d'un exercice d'influence ou d'un acte ou omission concernant\n(iii) la conclusion d'affaires avec le gouvernement ou un sujet d'affaires ayant trait au gouvernement,\nou\n(iv)\nque, de fait, le fonctionnaire soit en mesure ou non de collaborer, d'aider, d'exercer une influence ou de faire ou omettre ce qui est projet\u00e9, selon le cas.\nL'expression \u00ab fonctionnaire \u00bb ou l'expression \u00ab official \u00bb dans la version anglaise ont, pour les fins de l'art. 102 et des autres articles de la Partie III du Code Criminel, le sens que leur attribuent les dispositions ci-apr\u00e8s de l'art. 99(e).\n99. Dans la pr\u00e9sente Partie, l'expression\n***\ne) 'fonctionnaire' d\u00e9signe une personne qui\n(i) d\u00e9tient une charge ou un emploi, ou\n(ii) est nomm\u00e9e pour remplir une fonction publique;\n99. In this Part,\n***\ne) 'official' means a person who\n(i) holds an office, or\n(ii) is appointed to discharge a public duty; La Cour d'Appel ayant d'abord not\u00e9 que les membres du Conseil L\u00e9gislatif, nomm\u00e9s par le Lieutenant-Gouverneur au nom de la Reine, participent de par leur fonction \u00e0 la discussion et \u00e0 l'adoption des lois, consid\u00e9ra qu'il est difficile de concevoir une fonction qui plus que celle-l\u00e0 ait le caract\u00e8re et la nature d'une fonction publique, que donnant au texte de l'art. 99(e) (ii) son sens ordinaire, il s'ensuit que la compr\u00e9hensibilit\u00e9 de la disposition demande d'y inclure et non d'en exclure la fonction de conseiller l\u00e9gislatif, ou \u00ab official \u00bb au sens de l'art. 102. Avec ces vues je suis et que partant le conseiller l\u00e9gislatif est un \u00ab fonctionnaire \u00bb respectueusement d'accord.\nA l'audition devant nous, l'appelant, au soutien de la proposition contraire, a d'abord soumis l'argument suivant: L'article 102 doit \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la Common Law; sous la Common Law, il n'y a pas d'offense de corruption (bribery) \u00e0 moins que l'officier public concern\u00e9 soit, suivant le langage des trait\u00e9s et de la jurisprudence \u00ab a judicial or a ministerial officer \u00bb ce qui exclut toute personne\u2014tel un conseiller l\u00e9gislatif\u2014dont la fonction publique est ni judiciaire ni minist\u00e9rielle. A mon avis cet argument ne peut \u00eatre retenu. Nous ne pouvons en effet nous substituer au Parlement pour ajouter \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition de l'art. 99(e) (ii) les mots \u00ab judiciaire ou minist\u00e9rielle \u00bb, dans la version fran\u00e7aise, et les mots \u00ab judicial or ministerial \u00bb, dans la version anglaise, comme qualificatifs des expressions \u00ab fonction publique \u00bb et \u00ab public duty \u00bb respectivement. D'ailleurs nous ne pourrions attribuer au mot \u00ab ministerial \u00bb dans le contexte jurisprudentiel de l'expression \u00ab judicial or ministerial officer \u00bb le sens restreint que sugg\u00e8re l'appelant mais que rejette la Common Law, ainsi qu'il appert de la d\u00e9cision de la Cour d'Appel d'Angleterre dans Rex. v. Whitaker[2], o\u00f9 un argument similaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis et rejet\u00e9. Il convient de citer l'extrait suivant pris aux pages 1296 et 1297 du Rapport.\nThen it was argued that the appellant was not a 'public and ministerial officer'. A public officer is an officer who discharges any duty in the discharge of which the public are interested, more clearly so if he is paid out of a fund provided by the public. If taxes go to supply his payment and the public have an interest in the duties he discharges, he is a public officer. The addition of the words 'and ministerial' does not affect the matter. In our view he is also a ministerial officer. The Attorney-General was right in his contention that the word 'ministerial' is here used in contrast with 'judicial'; every officer who is not a judicial is a ministerial officer. No other word would aptly qualify the position of the appellant as a public officer, and it is clear that the colonel of a regiment is a public ministerial officer.\nL'appelant soumet de plus que si le Parlement avait eu l'intention d'inclure les l\u00e9gislateurs dans le cadre de l'art. 102, il aurait manifest\u00e9 cette intention en mentionnant, dans la d\u00e9finition de l'art. 99(e) (ii), la personne \u00e9lue aussi bien que la \u00ab personne nomm\u00e9e pour remplir une fonction publique \u00bb. Je doute s\u00e9rieusement qu'en se servant du mot \u00ab nomm\u00e9e \u00bb le Parlement ait eu l'intention d'attribuer \u00e0 ce mot, dans le contexte de la d\u00e9finition de l'art. 99(e) (ii), le sens purement juridique et strictement restreint ainsi que la port\u00e9e qu'il faudrait lui donner, si en fait\u2014ce qui n'est pas\u2014il apparaissait que le mot \u00ab nomm\u00e9e \u00bb est utilis\u00e9, dans la d\u00e9finition, en contraste avec le mot \u00ab \u00e9lue \u00bb. Il me para\u00eet difficile de concilier avec la notion fondamentale de l'offense de corruption (bribery) la proposition qu'uniquement en raison de la m\u00e9thode par laquelle on acc\u00e8de \u00e0 une fonction publique, on puisse, suivant qu'on a \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 ou \u00e9lu, \u00eatre coupable ou innocent du crime de corruption m\u00eame si dans les deux cas la conduite de celui qui remplit la fonction publique est identiquement r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible. Ce qui est certain, c'est que le texte de la d\u00e9finition est in\u00e9luctable en ce qui concerne la personne qui est \u00ab nomm\u00e9e pour remplir une fonction publique \u00bb. Et c'est clairement l\u00e0 le cas du conseiller l\u00e9gislatif\u2014le seul que nous ayons \u00e0 d\u00e9cider en l'esp\u00e8ce\u2014qui, aux termes de l'art. 72 de l'Acte de l'Am\u00e9rique du Nord britannique, est nomm\u00e9 par le Lieutenant-Gouverneur. Cet argument ne peut \u00eatre accept\u00e9.\nEnfin, s'appuyant sur le fait que le texte de l'art. 100 mentionne sp\u00e9cifiquement les membres du Parlement du Canada ou d'une L\u00e9gislature, l'appelant pr\u00e9tend que le cas de celui qui est conseiller l\u00e9gislatif est exclusivement r\u00e9gi par l'art. 100 et que les dispositions de l'art. 102 ne sauraient jamais lui \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9es. Je ne puis admettre cette fa\u00e7on de voir. Bien que ces deux articles visent un m\u00eame mal, soit la corruption, chacun d'eux envisage une situation diff\u00e9rente et rien ne s'oppose \u00e0 ce que, par sa conduite, un conseiller l\u00e9gislatif qui est aussi, pour les fins de la partie III, un \u00ab fonctionnaire \u00bb ou \u00ab official \u00bb, se trouve, soit dans la situation d\u00e9crite \u00e0 l'art. 100, o\u00f9 l'acte incriminant doit, tel que l'exige le texte de cet article, avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9 par lui en sa qualit\u00e9 officielle de membre de la L\u00e9gislature, ou dans la situation d\u00e9crite \u00e0 l'art. 102 o\u00f9 une telle exigence n'est pas indiqu\u00e9e et o\u00f9 il suffit que l'acte incriminant soit pos\u00e9 par un \u00ab fonctionnaire \u00bb ou \u00ab official \u00bb,\nSur le deuxi\u00e8me point de droit:\u2014Pour rejeter la pr\u00e9tention que l'art. 102 ne s'applique au conseiller l\u00e9gislatif que dans le cas o\u00f9 les actes incriminants qu'on lui reproche ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9s par lui en sa qualit\u00e9 officielle, la Cour d'Appel consid\u00e9ra que l'art. 102 est d'application g\u00e9n\u00e9rale; que cet article vise l'usage impropre que fait ou pr\u00e9tend faire, de l'influence r\u00e9elle ou pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e dont il jouit, celui qui est nomm\u00e9 pour remplir une fonction publique; que le marchandage d'influence constitue l'essence de l'offense et que le but de la disposition est de pr\u00e9venir ce genre de corruption dans au moins une sph\u00e8re de la vie publique; que rien n'exige que, pour \u00eatre atteint par les dispositions de l'article, le marchand d'influence agisse en sa qualit\u00e9 officielle et qu'il suffit qu'il soit \u00ab fonctionnaire \u00bb ou \u00ab official \u00bb, puisque c'est de ce fait que certaines personnes pourraient \u00eatre conduites \u00e0 pr\u00e9sumer qu'il a quelque chose \u00e0 vendre, soit de l'influence. Avec cette fa\u00e7on de voir, je suis aussi respectueusement d'accord. J'ajouterai que, dans ses termes, l'art. 102 n'exige pas, comme le fait l'art. 100, que l'acte incriminant soit pos\u00e9 en la qualit\u00e9 officielle de celui \u00e0 qui il est reproch\u00e9.\nPour les raisons donn\u00e9s par MM. les Juges Casey et Brossard et celles qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, je dirais, comme la Cour d'Appel, que les deux points de droit sur lesquels le Juge au proc\u00e8s s'est fond\u00e9 pour acquitter l'appelant sont mal fond\u00e9s. C'est donc \u00e0 bon droit que l'appel log\u00e9 par la Couronne \u00e0 la Cour du banc de la reine a \u00e9t\u00e9 accueilli et que le verdict d'acquittement a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9cart\u00e9.\nReste \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer l'ordonnance de nouveau proc\u00e8s rendue par la Cour d'Appel au regard de la demande faite par l'intim\u00e9e en cette Cour d'\u00e9carter cette ordonnance et de consigner \u00e0 la place un verdict de culpabilit\u00e9.\nL'appelant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il ne niait pas qu'en principe cette Cour avait le pouvoir d'accorder semblable demande, mais il s'est oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 ce qu'elle soit accord\u00e9e en l'esp\u00e8ce en s'appuyant sur les raisons donn\u00e9es en Cour d'Appel au soutien de l'ordonnance de nouveau proc\u00e8s.\nSur la question, M. le Juge Casey avec l'accord de ses coll\u00e8gues, MM. les Juges Pratte et Brossard, a not\u00e9 que le choix que donne l'art. 592(4) (b) du Code Criminel n'en est pas un qu'il est toujours facile d'exercer et en ce qui concerne le pr\u00e9sent cas, il a particuli\u00e8rement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit\nThis case deals with corruption in public life, a matter of extreme gravity. For this reason it is highly desirable\u2014more so than in any other type of case\u2014that the facts and, if it goes that way, the sentence be discussed in the Court of first instance.\nTenant compte de cette d\u00e9claration de la Cour d'Appel et ayant consid\u00e9r\u00e9 la question, je croirais judicieux de ne pas intervenir pour modifier l'ordonnance de la Cour d'Appel. Et vu cette conclusion il convient de n'en dire davantage sur le point.\nJe renverrais l'appel.\nAppel rejet\u00e9.\nProcureur de l'appelant: Joseph Cohen, Montr\u00e9al.\nProcureur de l'intim\u00e9e: Ivan Mignault, Qu\u00e9bec.\n[1] (1965), 45 C.R. 322.\n[2] [1914] 3 K.B. 1283. 10 Cr.

Cette d\u00e9cision n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise, au pr\u00e9alable, \u00e0 une cour de justice de la province de Qu\u00e9bec ou \u00e0 I'un de ses juges.

La requ\u00e9rante en a conclu que la d\u00e9cision de la Commission tombait sous le r\u00e9gime de I'art. 41(1) de la Loi sur la Cour supr\u00eame, S.R.C. 1952, c. 259.\nArr\u00eat: La requ\u00eate pour permission d'appeler doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e.\nCette Cour est sans juridiction pour entendre et par cons\u00e9quent pour permettre un appel direct d'une d\u00e9cision \u00e9manant de la Commission des Relations de Travail du Qu\u00e9bec. Au sens de l'art. 41(1) de la Loi sur la Cour supr\u00eame, les expressions \u00ab Cour ou I'un de ses juges \u00bb visent les Cours et les juges dont est form\u00e9e cette branche de gouvernement que repr\u00e9sente le pouvoir judiciaire, ce qui ne comprend pas les organismes administratifs\u2014tels que, par exemple, les commissions administratives, les chambres professionnelles et leur comit\u00e9 de discipline\u2014et ce nonobstant le fait que certaines fonctions judiciaires puissent leur \u00eatre attribu\u00e9es purement comme accessoire ou compl\u00e9ment n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 la mise en \u0153uvre de leurs fonctions administratives. La Commission des Relations de Travail est I'un de ces organismes administratifs. Dans les dispositions du Code du Travail on peut bien reconna\u00eetre les traits classiques de ces organismes administratifs institu\u00e9s pour promouvoir la paix industrielle, mais on n'y trouve pas les caract\u00e9ristiques des cours de justice ou des juges des cours de justice que vise I'art. 41(1).

The applicant contended that the decision of the Board was the decision of the highest Court of final resort in the province where a judgment can be had in this particular case, since the provisions of the Labour Code, R.S.Q. 1964, c. 141, prohibit all recourses in justice against the Board on account of any act, proceeding or decision relating to the exercise of its functions. The applicant has inferred from this that the decision of the Board fell under s. 41(1) of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 259.\nHeld: The motion for leave to appeal should be dismissed.\nThis Court is without jurisdiction to hear and consequently to entertain an appeal direct from a decision of the Quebec Labour Relations Board. The expressions \"Court or a judge thereof\", within the meaning of s. 41(1) of the Supreme Court Act, allude to the Courts and the judges which form this branch of the government represented by the judiciary power, which does not include administrative bodies\u2014such as, for example, the administrative boards, the professional societies and their disciplinary committees\u2014and this, notwithstanding the fact that some judiciary functions can be attributed to them purely as an accessory or as a necessary complement to the carrying out of their administrative functions. The Labour Relations Board is one of these administrative bodies. One can recognize in the provisions of the Labour Code the classical features of these administrative bodies created to promote industrial peace, but one cannot find the characteristics of the courts of justice or of the judges of the courts of justice which s. 41(1) has in view. Furthermore, the Courts of justice Act, R.S.Q. 1964, c. 20, does not mention the Board in the enumeration of the tribunals having jurisdiction in the province.\nAPPLICATION for leave to appeal from a decision of the Quebec Labour Relations Board. Application dismissed.\nREQU\u00caTE pour permission d'appeler d'une d\u00e9cision de la Commission des Relations de Travail du Qu\u00e9bec. Requ\u00eate rejet\u00e9e.\nRichard Dufour, pour la requ\u00e9rante.\nRoger Thibaudeau, c.r., pour I'intim\u00e9. Hazen Hansard, c.r., pour la mise-en-cause.\nLe jugement de la Cour fut rendu par\nLe Juge FAUTEUX:\u2014La compagnie J. R. Th\u00e9berge Lt\u00e9e a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate \u00e0 cette Cour pour obtenir la permission d'appeler d'une d\u00e9cision rendue, le 14 septembre 1965, par la Commission des relations de travail du Qu\u00e9bec. Ce qui est exceptionnel, en I'esp\u00e8ce, c'est que cette d\u00e9cision n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise, au pr\u00e9alable, \u00e0 une cour de justice de la province de Qu\u00e9bec ou \u00e0 I'un de ses juges.\nAu seuil de I'audition, s'est pos\u00e9e la question de savoir si cette Cour a juridiction pour consid\u00e9rer une telle requ\u00eate et en disposer au m\u00e9rite. Sur le point, la requ\u00e9rante a soumis que les dispositions de I'art. 121du Code du travail, S.R.Q. 1964, c. 141 prohibent tout recours en justice contre la Commission des relations de travail du Qu\u00e9bec en raison d'actes, proc\u00e9dures ou d\u00e9cisions se rapportant \u00e0 I'exercice de sa fonction. Et il s'ensuit, a-t-on dit, en paraphrasant les dispositions de I'art. 41(1) de la Loi sur la Cour supr\u00eame, S.R.C. 1952, c. 259, que la d\u00e9cision de la Commission est la d\u00e9cision de la plus haute cour de dernier ressort dans la province o\u00f9 un jugement peut \u00eatre obtenu dans I'affaire en question. Et de l\u00e0 on a conclu que I'art. 41(1) conf\u00e8re \u00e0 cette Cour la juridiction de consid\u00e9rer la requ\u00eate en question et en disposer au m\u00e9rite. A la fin de I'audition, la Cour d\u00e9clara ne pouvoir accueillir cette conclusion comme bien fond\u00e9e et, apr\u00e8s avoir indiqu\u00e9 que des raisons \u00e9crites seraient ult\u00e9rieurement donn\u00e9es, rejeta la requ\u00eate avec d\u00e9pens.\nL'article 41 (1) se lit comme suit:\n41.(1) Sous r\u00e9serve du paragraphe (3) il peut \u00eatre interjet\u00e9 appel \u00e0 la Cour supr\u00eame, avec l'autorisation de cette Cour, contre tout jugement d\u00e9finitif ou autre de la plus haute cour de dernier ressort dans une province, ou de l'un de ses juges, o\u00f9 jugement peut \u00eatre obtenu dans la cause particuli\u00e8re dont on veut appeler \u00e0 la Cour supr\u00eame, qu'une autre cour ait refus\u00e9 ou non l'autorisation d'en appeler \u00e0 la Cour supr\u00eame.\nAinsi donc, la d\u00e9cision, dont il peut \u00eatre interjet\u00e9 appel en vertu de cette disposition, doit \u00eatre la d\u00e9cision d'une \u00ab cour \u2026ou de l'un de ses juges \u2026 \u00bb Ces expressions \u00ab cour \u2026ou de l'un de ses juges \u00bb sont les m\u00eames qui apparaissent dans le texte de ces autres articles, relatifs \u00e0 la juridiction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale d'appel de la Cour supr\u00eame, qui, avec l'art. 41 (1), sont group\u00e9s sous le titre de \u00ab Juridiction d'Appel \u00bb dans la Loi r\u00e9gissant cette Cour. II n'est certes aucune raison d'assigner \u00e0 ces expressions, dans le contexte de l'art. 41(1), un sens diff\u00e9rent du seul sens possible qui leur a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 attribu\u00e9 dans le contexte de ces autres articles, soit: cour de justice, et juges d'une cour de justice, ce qui n'inclut pas un corps ou tribunal administratifs, non plus que les membres composant un corps ou tribunal administratifs.\nII n'est pas sans \u00e0 propos de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer aux origines du pr\u00e9sent texte de l'art. 41. C'est par l'art. 2, de la Loi 13 Geo. VI, c. 37, sanctionn\u00e9e le 10 d\u00e9cembre 1949 et proclam\u00e9e le 23 d\u00e9cembre de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e, que le Parlement augmenta consid\u00e9rablement la juridiction de la Cour supr\u00eame par l'adoption du texte de l'art. 41(1); et c'est par l'art. 3 de la m\u00eame Loi qu'il abolit les appels au Conseil priv\u00e9. Dans cette simultan\u00e9it\u00e9 de l'abolition des appels au Comit\u00e9 judiciaire et de l'extension consid\u00e9rable de la juridiction de la Cour supr\u00eame ainsi devenue cour de dernier ressort, on peut validement apercevoir, je crois, une intention du Parlement de conf\u00e9rer \u00e0 la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada une contrepartie, en quelque sorte, de la juridiction d'appel jusque l\u00e0 exerc\u00e9e par le Comit\u00e9 judiciaire. Ceci n'implique pas \u00e9videmment que cette nouvelle juridiction aille au-del\u00e0 des limites fix\u00e9es par les termes de l'art. 41(1) qui la conf\u00e8re. Mais il convient de noter que la juridiction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale d'appel, du Conseil priv\u00e9, \u00e9tait elle-m\u00eame exerc\u00e9e, \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de d\u00e9cisions \u00e9manant du pouvoir judiciaire\u2014et non de d\u00e9cisions \u00e9manant du pouvoir ex\u00e9cutif ou administratif\u2014ainsi qu'il appert \u00e0 l'art. Ill de la loi An Act for the better Administration of Justice in His Majesty's Privy Council, 3 & 4 Will. 4, c. 41 (1833):\nIII. All appeals or complaints in the nature of appeals whatever, which either by virtue of this Act, or of any law, statute or custom, may be brought before His Majesty or His Majesty in Council from or in respect of the determination, sentence, rule or order of any Court, judge or judicial officer, and all such appeals as are now pending and unheard, shall from and after the passing of this Act be referred by His Majesty to the said Judicial Committee of his Privy Council, and that such appeals, causes and matters shall be heard by the said Judicial Committee, and a report or recommendation thereon shall be made to His Majesty in Council for his decision thereon as heretofore, in the same manner and form as has been heretofore the custom with respect to matters referred by His Majesty to the whole of the Privy Council or a committee thereof (the nature of such report or recommendation being always stated in open Court). Dans Lovibond v. Governor General of Canada[1] , une requ\u00eate, pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au Conseil priv\u00e9, pour obtenir la permission d'appeler du refus du Gouverneur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada d'accorder son fiat pour une p\u00e9tition de droit, fut rejet\u00e9e. Le motif de ce rejet est fid\u00e8lement rapport\u00e9 comme suit au sommaire de la d\u00e9cision du Conseil priv\u00e9:\nThe Governor General of Canada, in deciding under s. 4 of the Petition of Right Act of Canada whether to grant his fiat, does not act as a 'judicial officer' within the meaning of s. 3 of the Judicial Committee Act, 1833, and consequently an appeal from his refusal does not lie to His Majesty in Council.\nOn peut noter que l'expression \u00ab judicial officer \u00bb, apparaissant \u00e0 l'art. III de la Loi r\u00e9gissant le Comit\u00e9 judiciaire, est absente du texte de l'art. 41(1) lequel ne r\u00e9f\u00e8re qu'\u00e0 la \u00ab \u2026cour \u2026 ou de l'un de ses juges\u2026 \u00bb.\nEn somme, au sens de l'art. 41(1), comme au sens des articles avec lesquels il appara\u00eet sous le titre de \u00ab Juridiction d'appel \u00bb, dans la Loi sur la Cour supr\u00eame, l'expression \u00ab \u2026cour \u2026ou de l'un de ses juges\u2026 \u00bb vise les cours et les juges dont est form\u00e9e cette branche de gouvernement que repr\u00e9sente le pouvoir judiciaire, ce qui ne comprend pas les organismes administratifs\u2014tels, par exemple, les commissions administratives, les chambres professionnelles et leurs comit\u00e9s de discipline\u2014et ce nonobstant le fait que certaines fonctions judiciaires puissent leur \u00eatre attribu\u00e9es purement comme accessoire ou compl\u00e9ment n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 la mise en \u0153uvre de leurs fonctions administratives.\nLa Commission des relations de travail est l'un de ces organismes administratifs. Le Code du travail, S.R.Q. 1964, c. 141, pourvoit \u00e0 son \u00e9tablissement et \u00e0 sa composition. L'article 100 prescrit que:\n100. Est institu\u00e9 un organisme sous le nom, en fran\u00e7ais, de 'Commission des relations de travail du Qu\u00e9bec', en anglais, de 'Quebec Labour Relations Board'.\nCette Commission est form\u00e9e d'un pr\u00e9sident, de cinq vice-pr\u00e9sidents et de huit autres membres dont quatre repr\u00e9sentent les employeurs et quatre repr\u00e9sentent les salari\u00e9s. Ces huit membres sont recommand\u00e9s au ministre par les associations ouvri\u00e8res et patronales les plus repr\u00e9sentatives.\nAucune disposition du Code du travail n'exige, comme qualification, d'une des personnes, formant cette Commission, d'\u00eatre avocat. Les dispositions du Code du travail \u00e9dictent que les s\u00e9ances de la Commission sont pr\u00e9sid\u00e9es par le pr\u00e9sident ou l'un des vice-pr\u00e9sidents et que les membres repr\u00e9sentant les employeurs et ceux repr\u00e9sentant les employ\u00e9s doivent y si\u00e9ger en nombre \u00e9gal; que plusieurs s\u00e9ances de la Commission peuvent \u00eatre tenues simultan\u00e9ment; que le quorum est de trois membres dont le pr\u00e9sident ou l'un des vice-pr\u00e9sidents et un membre repr\u00e9sentant les employeurs et l'autre repr\u00e9sentant les employ\u00e9s; que la Commission et ses membres ont tous les pouvoirs, immunit\u00e9s et privil\u00e8ges des commissaires nomm\u00e9s en vertu de la Loi des commissions d'enqu\u00eate; que la Commission peut, pour cause, reviser, r\u00e9voquer toute d\u00e9cision, tout ordre et tout certificat qu'elle peut \u00e9mettre.\nDans les dispositions qui pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent aussi bien que dans celles ayant trait aux pouvoirs de la Commission et de ses membres, on peut bien reconna\u00eetre les traits devenus classiques de ces organismes administratifs institu\u00e9s pour promouvoir la paix industrielle, mais on n'y trouve pas les caract\u00e9ristiques des cours de justice ou des juges des cours de justice que vise l'art. 41(1). Ajoutons enfin que la Loi des tribunaux judiciaires; S.R.Q. 1964, c. 20, ne fait \u00e9videmment aucune mention de la Commission des relations de travail dans l'\u00e9num\u00e9ration des tribunaux ayant juridiction dans la province.\nSi, de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, il faut conclure que cette Cour est sans juridiction pour entendre et par cons\u00e9quent permettre un appel direct \u00e0 cette Cour d'une d\u00e9cision \u00e9manant de la Commission des relations de travail, il ne s'ensuit pas que tel serait le cas s'il s'agissait de l'appel d'un jugement, \u00e9manant d'une cour vis\u00e9e par l'art. 41(1) ou de l'un de ses juges, concernant une telle d\u00e9cision.\nPour ces raisons, et comme d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9, la demande de permission d'appeler ne pouvait \u00eatre accord\u00e9e et fut rejet\u00e9e avec d\u00e9pens.\nRequ\u00eate rejet\u00e9e avec d\u00e9pens.\nProcureurs de la requ\u00e9rante: Dufour, Tremblay & Larouche, Chicoutimi.\nProcureur de l'intim\u00e9: R.
