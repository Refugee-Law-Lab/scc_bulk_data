Appellant;\nand\nThe Canadian Pacific Railway Company Respondent.\n1929: January 24.\nPresent: Duff J. in chambers.\nON APPEAL FROM THE BOARD OF RAILWAY COMMISSIONERS FOR CANADA\nAppeal\u2014Leave to appeal\u2014Jurisdiction\u2014Order of the Board of Railway Commissioners\u2014Leave of Board for operating railway\u2014Jurisdiction of the Board\u2014Railway Act, [1927], R.S.C., c. 170, ss. 62 (2), 276.\nThe Canadian National Railways applied for leave to appeal from an order of the Board of Railway Commissioners, made upon an application of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company under s. 276 of the Railway Act, by which that company was \u201cauthorized to open for the carriage of traffic that portion of its Swift Current north-westerly branch from * * * Willingdon to * * * Strathcona.\u201d Willingdon is the north-western terminus of the Cut Knife branch of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, a branch constructed and operated under Parliamentary authority independently of that company\u2019s principal Act of 1881. In 1919, the respondent company secured the approval by the Minister of Railways for the construction of a branch line to be known as the Swift Current branch, extending from a point near Galihead, in a northerly direction to Willingdon and thence in a westerly direction to Strathcona. On the 30th of July, 1928, when the Board made an order approving of a revised general location of this route, parts only of the line had been constructed leaving extensive gaps where the building of the line had not yet proceeded. The points of jurisdiction raised by the Canadian National Railways are stated thus: the authority of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company to operate branch lines under the Act of 1881 is a single indivisible authority applying only to a branch line in its entirety, as defined by the approved route map and consequently section 276 of the Railway Act invests the Board with no jurisdiction to sanction the opening for traffic of a part of any such branch line; and, alternatively, the appellant contended that in effect the order of the Board will enable the respondent company to work that part of the Swift Current branch, from Willingdon to Strathcona, as an extension of the Cut Knife branch, this not being permissible under the Railway Act.\nHeld, that leave to appeal should not be granted, as the intending appellant has not advanced any arguable objection to the jurisdiction of the Board of Railway Commissioners. (Railway Act, s. 52 (2) ). As to the first of the alternative contentions: there is no doubt that, under the provisions of sections 4 and 15 of the schedule to the contract between the respondent company and the Parliament of Canada, that company stands in an exceptional position with regard to unspecified branches thereby authorized and it cannot be contended that the authority to operate, any more than the authority to construct, any part of the \u201cline of railway\u201d to be known as the Canadian Pacific Railway under the direction of section 15, is conditioned upon the working of the system as a whole or of any integral part thereof. Moreover, by section 17 of the schedule, the enactments of the Consolidated Railway Act of 1879 when applicable have been incorporated in the respondent\u2019s contract; and section 37 of that Act, which seems to be the parent of the present section 276, presupposes authority in the respondent company, in the absence of an order to the contrary under section 39, to proceed with the working of a portion only of the railway. As to the second alternative point: the Board has jurisdiction under section 276 to make orders authorizing the opening for traffic of part of a railway; this contemplates, as the sequence of such an order, subject to the control of the Board, the working of the particular part of the railway to which the order applies under no greater restrictions than those which would affect the operation of it if the branch were in operation as a whole.\nAPPLICATION for leave to appeal to this court under section 52 (2) of the Railway Act from an order of the Board of Railway Commissioners of the 21st day of December, 1928, made upon an application of the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. under section 276 of the Railway Act.\nE. Lafleur K.C., A. Fraser K.C. and Geo. F. Macdonnell K.C. for the application.\nW. N. Tilley K.C. and E. P. Flintojt K.C. contra.\nDuff J.\u2014The Canadian National Railways applies for leave to appeal from an order of the Board of Railway Commissioners of the 21st of December, 1928, made upon an application of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company under s. 276 of the Railway Act, by which the company was authorized to open for the carriage of traffic that portion of its Swift Current north-westerly branch from mile 361-3 at Willingdon to mile 428-7 at Strathcona.\nThe jurisdiction to grant leave to appeal vested in a judge of this court under s. 52 (2) of the Railway Act, is operative only for the purpose of enabling the intending appellant to arraign the order of the Board as exceeding the jurisdiction of that body.\nThe question of jurisdiction which the Canadian National Railway wishes to raise is put by counsel in two ways; and in order to make the point intelligible, it is necessary first to state briefly the cardinal facts. Willingdon is the north-western terminus of the Cut Knife branch of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, a branch constructed and operated under Parliamentary authority independently of that company\u2019s principal Act of 1881 (44 Vic, c 1). In 1919, the company secured the approval, under the Railway Act as it then stood, by the Minister of Railways, of a branch line referred to as the Swift Current branch, to be constructed under the authority of that Act. The route so approved extended from a point at or near Galihead, in a northerly direction to Willingdon, and thence in a westerly direction to Strathcona. On the 30th of July, 1928, when the Board made an order approving of a revised general location of this route, parts only of the line had been constructed; from Swift Current to Empress, from Coronation to Lorraine and from Willingdon to Strathcona, leaving extensive gaps on the route as approved, where the building of the line had not yet proceeded.\nThe parliamentary sanction for the Swift Current branch, as already mentioned, rests upon the provisions of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company\u2019s principal Act. The point of jurisdiction, which the Canadian National Railways ask leave to bring before the Supreme Court of Canada is stated thus: the authority of the company to operate branch lines under the Act of 1881 is a single indivisible authority applying only to a branch line in its entirety, as defined by the approved route map, and consequently, s. 276 of the Railway Act invests the Board with no jurisdiction to sanction the opening for traffic of a part of any such branch line. Alternatively, the intending appellants propose to contend that in effect the order of the Board will enable the Canadian Pacific Railway to work that part of the Swift Current branch (from Willingdon to Strathcona) which the order affects, as an extension of the Cut Knife branch, and this, they say, is not permissible under the Railway Act.\nAs to the first of the alternative contentions. The pertinent provisions of the contract and schedule are article 14 of the contract, and sections 4 and 15 of the schedule. The precise words of s. 2, in virtue of which the schedule has the force of law, are these\nthe Governor may grant to them (the persons whose names are mentioned in the contract) under the corporate name of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, a charter conferring upon them the franchises, privileges and powers embodied in the schedule to the said contract, and to this Act appended, and such charter shall have force and effect as if it were an Act of the Parliament of Canada.\nSections 4 and 15 of the schedule are respectively as follows:\n4. All the franchises and powers necessary or useful to the company to enable them to carry out, perform, enforce, use, and avail themselves of, every condition, stipulation, obligation, duty, right, remedy, privilege, and advantage agreed upon, contained or described in the said contract, are hereby conferred upon the company. And the enactment of the special provisions hereinafter contained shall not be held to impair or derogate from the generality of the franchises and power so hereby conferred upon them.\n15. The company may lay out, construct, acquire, equip, maintain and work a continuous line of railway, of the gauge of four feet eight and one-half inches; which railway shall extend from the terminus of the Canada Central Railway near Lake Nipissing, known as Callander Station, to Port Moody in the province of British Columbia; and also, a branch line of railway from some point on the main line of railway to Fort William on Thunder Bay; and also the existing branch line of railway from Selkirk, in the province of Manitoba, to Pembina in the said province; and also other branches to be located by the company from time to time as provided by the said contract,\u2014the said branches to be of the gauge aforesaid; and the said main line of railway, and the said branch lines of railway, shall be commenced and completed as provided by the said contract; and together with such other branch lines as shall be hereafter constructed by the said company, and any extension of the said main line of railway that shall hereafter be constructed or acquired by the company, shall constitute the line of railway hereinafter called The Canadian Pacific Railway. It will be observed that the powers of the company under s. 15, touching the construction and working of the unspecified branch lines, are bestowed by the self same words as its powers in relation to the main line and the specified branches; while s. 4 plainly manifests the intention of Parliament that this language shall receive the most liberal construction in order to effectuate the purposes of the contract and in particular of articles 13 and 14.\nMy duty on this application is to consider whether the question which the Canadian National Railways desire to raise is one in respect of which there can be said to be a fairly arguable controversy. I am quite unable to discern any possible ground for doubt upon the question whether under these provisions the Canadian Pacific Railway Company stands in an exceptional position with regard to unspecified branches thereby authorized. I can discover nothing giving any substance to the contention that the authority to operate, any more than the authority to construct, any part of the \u201cline of railway\u201d to be known as the Canadian Pacific Railway, under the direction of s. 15, is conditioned upon the working of the system as a whole or of any integral part thereof. Moreover, by sec. 17 of the schedule, the enactments of the Consolidated Railway Act of 1879, in so far as applicable to the undertaking of the company, and if not inconsistent with, or contrary to the provisions of the schedule, are incorporated therewith. Section 37 of that Act (s. 200 of the statute of 1888), which seems to be the parent of the present s. 276, obviously presupposes authority in the company, in the absence of an order to the contrary under s. 39 (s. 202 of the statute of 1888), to proceed with the working of a portion only of the railway; and it is of course not disputed that this view has dictated the practice of the railways, of the Railway Committee of the Privy Council, and of the Board of Railway Commissioners in respect of railways generally; and as a rule the Special Acts governing railway construction and operation do not in any relevant respect differ materially in their cardinal provisions as to construction and operation from the provisions of s. 15. The objection now sought to be raised appears to be without foundation in the language of the statutes, and to give effect to it would involve a startling departure from the settled opinion as to the meaning of these statutes and from the long settled practice thereunder.\nAs to the second alternative, I am constrained to the conclusion that it is not a point of substance. The Board has jurisdiction under sec. 276 to make orders authorizing the opening for traffic of part of a railway. This seems to contemplate as the consequence of such an order, subject to such control as the Board is entitled to exercise in execution of its powers under the Act, the working of the particular part of the railway, to which the order applies, under no greater restrictions than those which would affect the operation of it if the branch were in operation as a whole; and it is not suggested that the Canadian Pacific Railway Company contemplates a use of this particular part of its Swift Current branch in a manner which would not be permissible in such circumstances. Some expressions let fall by the Chairman of the Board of Railway Commissioners in dealing with the application of the 25th of July, 1928, were relied upon. The words used by the learned Chairman are these:\nIt is proposed to practically extend the Cut Knife branch from Willingdon to Edmonton.\nAs a famous judge once observed, the adverb \u201cpractically\u201d has the force of a negative. It is not to be supposed that the learned Chairman was treating the piece of railway with which he was concerned as such an extension, which, as he fully recognizes, it in law could not be; and what was meant, no doubt, was that the Canadian Pacific Railway Company would take advantage of its line from Willingdon to Strathcona to reap as far as possible the economic benefits which might be derived from such an extension. I can discover no arguable ground for a contention that such a course is not entirely within the rights of that company.\nFor the reasons I have thus outlined, I have come to the conclusion that this is not a proper case for leave, because I entertain no doubt that no arguable objection to the jurisdiction of the Board has been advanced.\nThe application is dismissed with costs.\nApplication refused with costs.\n",

A. Macdonald J.\nThe trustee moved for an order setting aside a transfer by the insolvent to the respondent of the sum of $4,053.95 due him by the Government of Canada. The transfer was made less than sixty days before the assignment under the Bankruptcy Act, and it was attacked on two grounds: (1) that it was utterly void as against the trustee by virtue of s. 3 (2) of the Fraudulent Preferences Act, R.S.B.C., 1924, c. 97; and, alternatively, (2) that it was fraudulent and void as against the trustee by virtue of s. 64 of the Bankruptcy Act.\nSection 64 of the Bankruptcy Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 11, reads as follows:\n64. Every conveyance or transfer of property or charge thereon made, every payment made, every obligation incurred, and every judicial proceeding taken or suffered by any insolvent person in favour of any creditor or of any person in trust for any creditor with a view of giving such creditor a preference over the other creditors shall, if the person making, incurring, taking, paying or suffering the same is adjudged bankrupt on a bankruptcy petition presented within three months after the date of making, incurring, taking, paying or suffering the same, or if he makes an authorized assignment, within three months after the date of the making, incurring, taking, paying or suffering the same, be deemed fraudulent and void as against the trustee in the bankruptcy or under the authorized assignment. 2. If any such conveyance, transfer, payment, obligation or judicial proceeding has the effect of giving any creditor a preference over other creditors, or over any one or more of them, it shall be presumed prima facie to have been made, incurred, taken, paid or suffered with such view as aforesaid whether or not it was made voluntarily or under pressure and evidence of pressure shall not be receivable or avail to support such transaction.\n3. For the purpose of this section, the expression \"creditor\" shall include a surety or guarantor for the debt due to such creditor.\nSection 65 of the Act contains provisions protecting from invalidation payments, conveyances, etc., made under certain conditions.\nSection 3 of the Fraudulent Preferences Act, R.S.B.C., 1924, c. 97, reads as follows:\n3. (1.) Subject to the provisions of section 4, every gift, conveyance, assignment, transfer, delivery over or payment of goods, chattels, or effects, or of bills, bonds, notes, or securities, or of shares, dividends, premiums, or bonus in any bank, company, or corporation, or of any other property, real or personal, made by a person at a time when he is in insolvent circumstances, or is unable to pay his debts in full, or knows that he is on the eve of insolvency, shall:\u2014\n(a.) If made with intent to defeat, hinder, delay, or prejudice his creditors or any one or more of them, be, as against the creditor or creditors injured, delayed, or prejudiced, utterly void; and\n(b.) If made to or for a creditor with intent to give such creditor preference over his other creditors or over any one or more of them, be, as against the creditor or creditors injured, delayed, prejudiced, or postponed, utterly void.\n(2.) Subject to the provisions of section 4, every such gift, conveyance, assignment, or transfer, delivery over or payment as aforesaid, made to or for a creditor by a person at any time when he is in insolvent circumstances, or is unable to pay his debts in full, or knows that he is on the eve of insolvency, and which has the effect of giving such creditor a preference over the other creditors of the debtor or over one or more of them, shall\n(a.) In and with respect to any action or proceeding which, within sixty days thereafter, is brought, had, or taken to impeach or set aside such transaction, be utterly void as against the creditor or creditors injured, delayed, prejudiced, or postponed; and\n(b.) If the debtor, within sixty days after the transaction, makes an assignment for the benefit of his creditors, be utterly void as against the assignee or any creditor authorized to take proceedings to avoid the same.\n3. [Provides as to when a transaction shall be deemed to be one which has the effect of giving a creditor a preference within the meaning of subs. 2.]\n4. [\"Creditor\" or \"creditors\" in subss. 1, 2 and 3, to include a surety or endorser who would upon payment by him become a creditor of the person giving the preference, and to include a cestui que trust or other person to whom the liability is equitable only.] Section 4 of the Act contains, among other things, provisions protecting from the application of s. 3 payments, conveyances, etc., made under certain conditions.\nW. A. Macdonald J. found that the debtor was insolvent, within the meaning of the law, at the time the transfer was made, that it had the effect of giving the respondent a preference over the other creditors of the debtor, but that it was not made with a view of giving the respondent a preference; and that, if the trustee were confined solely to s. 64 of the Bankruptcy Act, the presumption created would have been destroyed by the evidence; but he held that the trustee was entitled to the benefit of the provincial statute, and that under it the transfer was void.\nThe Court of Appeal[2] set aside this judgment on the ground that there was here a conflict between Dominion and provincial legislation, and that the Dominion enactment should prevail; and that, as the presumption of fraudulent intent had been rebutted, the attack on the transfer failed.\nFrom this judgment the trustee sought leave to appeal. The petition was dismissed with costs.\nN. G. Larmonth for the petitioner.\nR. W. Ginn for the respondent.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014This is a petition by the trustee of the bankrupt estate of S. R. Wallace, under section 174 of the Bankruptcy Act (R.S.C., 1927, c. 11), for special leave to appeal from the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia[3] reversing the judgment of Mr. Justice W. A. Macdonald.\nThe litigation arose in connection with a motion of the trustee for an order setting aside a transfer by the insolvent to the respondent of the sum of $4,053.95 due him by the Canadian Government. The transfer was made less than sixty days before Wallace's assignment under the Bankruptcy Act, and it was attacked on two grounds: 1, that it should be deemed fraudulent and void against the trustee under section 64 of the Bankruptcy Act; 2, that it was utterly void under section 3 of the provincial statute, the Fraudulent Preferences Act, R.S.B.C., c. 97. The difference between the two statutory enactments, both of which deal with fraudulent preferences, is that subsection 2 of section 64 of the Bankruptcy Act, when the transfer, made within three months of the assignment in bankruptcy, has the effect of giving any creditor a preference over other creditors, creates merely a prima facie presumption that the transfer was made with a view to give the creditor such a preference; whereas section 3 of the provincial statute renders the transfer, having the effect to give a creditor preference over other creditors, utterly void as against the assignee or any creditor authorized to take proceedings when it was made within sixty days before an assignment by the debtor for the benefit of his creditors. Under the former statute the presumption of a fraudulent intent can be rebutted, under the latter it cannot.\nThe learned trial judge, upon consideration of section 64 of the Bankruptcy Act, found that the presumption of a fraudulent intent had been successfully rebutted, but he annulled the transfer under section 3 of the provincial statute, which he held established an irrebuttable presumption of fraudulent intent from the mere fact that the transfer, made less than sixty days before the assignment in bankruptcy, had the effect of giving the creditor a preference over the other creditors.\nThe Court of Appeal[4] set aside this judgment for the reason that there was here a clear conflict between Dominion and Provincial legislation, and that the Dominion enactment should prevail. Inasmuch, therefore, as the fraudulent intent had been rebutted, the court held that the transfer could not be attacked.\nThe petitioner now seeks leave to appeal from this judgment. In my opinion, the decision of the Court of Appeal is clearly right. The learned judges base their judgment on the decision of the Judicial Committee in La Compagnie Hydraulique de St. Fran\u00e7ois v. Continental Heat & Light Co.[5] , where it was held that when\na given field of legislation is within the competence both of the Parliament of Canada and of the Provincial Legislature, and both have legislated, the enactment of the Dominion Parliament must prevail over that of the province if the two are in conflict. The decision of the Privy Council in Attorney General of Ontario v. Attorney General of Canada[6] is, moreover, directly in point. The question there was as to the effect of a similar provincial statute, \"An Act respecting assignments and preferences by insolvent persons\" (R.S.O., 1887, c. 124), which had been enacted at a time when no Bankruptcy Act of the Dominion was in force. After discussing features common to all systems of bankruptcy and insolvency, Lord Herschell, speaking on behalf of their Lordships, said at p. 200:\u2014\nIn their Lordships' opinion these considerations must be borne in mind when interpreting the words \"bankruptcy\" and \"insolvency\" in the British North America Act. It appears to their Lordships that such provisions as are found in the enactment in question, relating as they do to assignments purely voluntary, do not infringe on the exclusive legislative power conferred upon the Dominion Parliament. They would observe that a system of bankruptcy legislation may frequently require various ancillary provisions for the purpose of preventing the scheme of the Act from being defeated. It may be necessary for this purpose to deal with the effect of executions and other matters which would otherwise be within the legislative competence of the provincial legislature. Their Lordships do not doubt that it would be open to the Dominion Parliament to deal with such matters as part of a bankruptcy law, and the provincial legislature would doubtless be then precluded from interfering with this legislation inasmuch as such interference would affect the bankruptcy law of the Dominion Parliament. But it does not follow that such subjects, as might properly be treated as ancillary to such a law and therefore within the powers of the Dominion Parliament, are excluded from the legislative authority of the provincial legislature when there is no bankruptcy or insolvency legislation of the Dominion Parliament in existence.\nThe recent pronouncement of the Judicial Committee in Royal Bank of Canada v. Larue[7] is also in point\nThe advisability of granting special leave to appeal to this Court from a judgment of a Court of Appeal, which is final and conclusive unless such special leave to appeal be obtained, is left to the discretion of the judge of this Court to whom the application for special leave is made (s. 174, Bankruptcy Act). I think that were leave to appeal granted in this case to the petitioner, the latter would not have a fairly arguable case to submit to this Court. Under these circumstances I would not be justified in retarding the liquidation of the insolvent estate by allowing a further appeal on this question of conflict between Dominion and Provincial legislation, which I must regard as settled beyond peradventure. The petition is therefore dismissed with costs.\nPetition dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the petitioner: Griffin, Montgomery & Smith.\nSolicitor for the respondent: R. W.

The Board fixed the rates on the basis of an allowance of 10% as a fair return on the investment in the enterprise, and in determining the \"rate base\" (the amount to be considered as invested in the enterprise) it included as a capital expenditure a sum which was the discount on the sale of the company's bonds. The rates were to continue in force for three years from the date on which gas was first supplied. In 1926 the appellant company applied for continuation of the rates. On this application the city objected to such a high rate of return and to the inclusion in the rate base of the item for bond discount. The Board continued said item in the rate base, but reduced the return to 9% \"in view of the elements which go to make up the rate base, and in view of the altered conditions of the money market.\" The parties appealed (by leave) to the Appellate Division, Alta., and then to this Court, the company against the reduction of the rate of return, and the city against the inclusion of the bond discount item in the rate base. The company contended that no evidence was adduced before the Board of \"altered conditions of the money market,\" and that, without hearing evidence upon the point and giving the company opportunity to establish that the conditions of the money market had remained unaltered since 1922, the Board acted without jurisdiction in making the reduction. Under s. 47 of The Public Utilities Act, 1923, Alta., c. 53, as amended 1927, c. 39, an appeal lies from the Board upon a question \"of jurisdiction\" or \"of law,\" upon leave obtained.\nHeld 1. The company's last mentioned contention involved a \"question of law,\" and therefore it had a right to appeal.\n2. The city's appeal failed; the question raised thereon was not one of jurisdiction or law.\n3. The company's appeal failed. The Board had power to reduce the rate of return, notwithstanding that at the hearing before it no witnesses testified as to altered conditions of the money market. The company's contention that to alter the rate of return would be unfair to its shareholders who had invested in the enterprise after the order fixing the rates in 1922, was not a matter open for consideration upon the appeal, as it did not involve a question of jurisdiction or law.\nPer Rinfret and Lamont JJ.: A consideration of ss. 21 (4) (5), 25, 43, and 44 of the said Act, the purposes of the Act, and the extent of the powers vested in the Board, leads to the conclusion that the intention of the legislature was to leave it largely to the Board's discretion to say in what manner it should obtain the information required for the proper exercise of its functions; it was not to be bound by the technical rules of legal evidence, but was to be governed by such rules as, in its discretion, it thought fit to adopt. An inference that it had not the proper evidence before it as to the altered conditions of the money market could not be drawn from the fact that no oral testimony in respect thereof was given at the hearing. The company had notice that a reduction was sought and that the city was attacking the methods and principles adopted in fixing the rate of return in 1922. This put the whole question of a fair return at large and informed the company that it would have to establish to the Board's satisfaction every element and condition necessary to justify a continuation of the 10% rate; and there was nothing in the record to justify the conclusion that the company had not the opportunity of making proof at the hearing as to the conditions of the money market.\nPer Smith J.: The Board has power to reduce the rate of return without evidence; the question of a fair rate of return is largely one of opinion, hardly capable of being reduced to certainty by evidence, and appears to be one of the things entrusted by the statute to the judgment of the Board. APPEALS by Northwestern Utilities, Limited, and the City of Edmonton, respectively, from the dismissal by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta of their respective appeals from the award of the Board of Public Utility Commissioners for the Province of Alberta fixing rates to be paid by consumers of natural gas, for the supply of which within the city of Edmonton the said company, Northwestern Utilities, Limited, has a franchise.\nThe company applied to the Board for an order continuing the rates which had been fixed for a certain period by an order of the Board made in 1922. The Board made an award fixing the rates, from which each party appealed to the Appellate Division. Under s. 47 of The Public Utilities Act of Alberta, 1923, c. 53, as amended 1927, c. 39, an appeal lies from the Board to the Appellate Division \"upon a question of jurisdiction or upon a question of law,\" if leave to appeal is obtained as therein provided. Such leave to appeal was obtained, it being reserved to each party to move before the Appellate Division to set aside the order granting leave to the other party, on the ground that the matters as to which leave to appeal was given did not involve any question of law or jurisdiction.\nThe company's objection to the Board's award was that it fixed the rates on the basis of an allowance of only 9%, instead of 10% which was allowed under the order made in 1922, as the \"rate of return\" on the investment in the enterprise. The Board in its award said:\u2014\nIn view of the elements which go to make up the rate base, and in view of the altered conditions of the money market, the Board believes it is justified in reducing the rate of return that the company shall be allowed, to nine per cent., and the Board's estimates are on that basis.\nThe company contended that there was before the Board no evidence of any \"altered conditions of the money market,\" that the \"elements which go to make up the rate base\" were the same as in 1922, and afforded no reason for changing the rate of return, that to reduce the rate of return would be unfair to its shareholders, who had invested in the enterprise after the order fixing the rates in 1922, that the money was invested and the plant constructed on the strength of the principles laid down in the 1922 award, and that it was clearly understood that the principles then adopted would govern all future revisions. The city's objection to the award was that, in determining the \"rate base\" (the amount to be considered as invested in the enterprise) it included (as it had done in the 1922 award) as a capital expenditure a sum which was the discount on the sale of the company's bonds.\nThe Appellate Division dismissed both appeals (no written reasons being given). Subsequently it made separate orders giving each party leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. On an application by both parties in the Supreme Court of Canada, the appeals were consolidated.\nBy the judgment of this Court both appeals were dismissed with costs.\nE. Lafleur K.C. and H. R. Milner K.C. for Northwestern Utilities, Limited.\nO. M. Biggar K.C. for the City of Edmonton.\nThe judgment of Anglin C.J.C. and Mignault J., was delivered by\nANGLIN C.J.C.\u2014While, with my brother Smith, I incline to the view that the appellant company may have some reason to complain of unfairness in the judgment of the Board of Public Utility Commissioners reducing the rate of return from 10% to 9%, I agree with the conclusion reached by my brother Lamont and concurred in by my brother Smith that it is not open to us to entertain the appeal of the company on that ground. It does not seem to raise either a question of law or jurisdiction within the purview of the statute on which the right of appeal rests. I would dismiss the appeal.\nThe judgment of Rinfret and Lamont JJ. was delivered by\nLAMONT J.\u2014These are separate but consolidated appeals by the Northwestern Utilities, Limited (hereinafter called the Company) and the City of Edmonton, respectively, from the dismissal by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta of their respective appeals against the award made by the Board of Public Utility Commissioners on an application by the company for an order fixing the price to be paid by the consumers of natural gas within the city. Subsequent to the dismissal of the appeals, the Appellate Division made separate orders giving each party leave to appeal to this Court. By a further order the appeals were consolidated.\nThe company is the successor of the Northern Alberta Natural Gas Development Company, which held a franchise from the city for the supply of natural gas to the inhabitants thereof.\nDisputes having arisen between the Development Company and the city, and an action having been commenced, the parties, on August 28, 1922, agreed to a settlement of their difficulties. One of the terms of the settlement was that the prices or rates to be paid by the inhabitants of the city should be fixed by the Board of Public Utility Commissioners. An application was accordingly made to the Board, the parties were heard, and, on November 27, 1922, an order was made fixing the rates to be paid. These rates were to continue in force for three years from the date on which gas was first supplied to consumers.\nIn order to fix just and reasonable rates, which it was the duty of the Board to fix, the Board had to consider certain elements which must always be taken into account in fixing a rate which is fair and reasonable to the consumer and to the company. One of these is the rate base, by which is meant the amount which the Board considers the owner of the utility has invested in the enterprise and on which he is entitled to a fair return. Another is the percentage to be allowed as a fair return.\nIn the award of 1922, which came into operation in the fall of 1923, the Board included in the rate base as a capital expenditure the sum of $283,900 (10% of the cost of plant) as, \"an allowance for the promotion and financing\" of the company, and the sum of $650,000 which was the discount on the sale of the Development Company's bonds. It also determined that 10% was a fair return on the investment. The rates thus fixed by the Board, with certain alterations made with the consent of all parties, continued in force for three years. In October, 1926, the appellant company, which had succeeded to the rights of the Development Company, applied to the Board for an order continuing the rates for such period as the Board might see fit. In its reply to the application the city submitted (par. 23) that the order of November, 1922, should in certain respects be disregarded. One of these was the following:\u2014\n(e) Rate of Return. It is submitted that the methods and principles adopted in the fixing of the rate of return are erroneous and that the rate of return allowed is too high.\nThe city also protested against including in the rate base the item for the promotion and financing of the company and the item for bond discount.\nIn its answer to the city's reply the company alleged (par. 10) that at the hearing in 1922 the city was fully and adequately represented, that it had submitted evidence, that upon the award being delivered it raised no objection to any part thereof, and, therefore, was now estopped from contending that the principles then laid down were wrong in principle or in fact.\nIn its award the Board continued both the above mentioned sums in the rate base, but reduced the rate of return to the company from 10% to 9%. The reason assigned by the Board for this reduction is as follows:\u2014\nIn view of the elements which go to make up the rate base, and in view of the altered conditions of the money market, the Board believes it is justified in reducing the rate of return that the Company shall be allowed, to nine per cent., (and the Board's estimates are on that basis.\nFrom the award the parties appealed, first to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, and now to this Court. The company appealed against the reduction of the rate of return on its capital expenditure to 9%. Referring to the reasons given by the Board for making the reduction the company in its factum says:\u2014\n1. The city adduced no evidence as to \"altered conditions of the money market\" and\n2. \"The elements which go to make up the rate base\" in 1927 are the same as in 1922.\nThe city appealed against the inclusion in the rate base of the item of the bond discount above mentioned.\nThe Public Utilities Act allows an appeal from the Board only upon a question of jurisdiction, or upon a question of law, and even then only when leave to appeal has first been obtained from a judge of the Appellate Division.\nAs against the company's appeal the city raises the preliminary objection that no question either of jurisdiction or law is involved therein. In my opinion the objection cannot be sustained. The substance of the company's appeal is that the Board in making a reduction in the rate of return did so for two reasons, one of which was the \"altered conditions of the money market,\" and that of this no evidence was adduced before the Board. The company contends that, without hearing evidence upon the point, and without giving it an opportunity to establish that the conditions of the money market had remained unaltered since 1922, the Board was without jurisdiction to make the reduction. This contention was not stated in this form in the order granting leave to appeal to the Appellate Division, but the fixing of the rate of return at 9% only, was there set out as an error of the Board in respect of which leave to appeal was granted.\nWhether or not the Board can properly base an order (in part at least) on the existence of a state of fact of which no evidence was adduced before it at the hearing and as to which the party affected has not had any opportunity of being heard is, in my opinion, a question of law which depends for its answer upon the construction to be placed upon the Public Utilities Act.\nI am, therefore, of opinion that the company had a right to appeal.\nThe question involved in this appeal is: Had the Board jurisdiction to find as a fact how the conditions of the money market had altered between November, 1922, and July, 1927, without any witness testifying at the hearing that an alteration had taken place.\nAs the Board was determining what would be a fair return on the capital invested by the company in the enterprise, and as it reduced the return from 10% to 9%, it can, I think, be taken that by \"the altered conditions of the money market\" the Board meant that the returns for money invested in securities in which moneys were ordinarily invested had decreased during the period in question. In other words, that the rate of interest obtainable for moneys furnished for investment was, generally speaking, lower by a certain percentage in 1927 than it was in 1922. That, in my opinion, is all that is involved in the finding.\nThe duty of the Board was to fix fair and reasonable rates; rates which, under the circumstances, would be fair to the consumer on the one hand, and which, on the other hand, would secure to the company a fair return for the capital invested. By a fair return is meant that the company will be allowed as large a return on the capital invested in its enterprise (which will be net to the company) as it would receive if it were investing the same amount in other securities possessing an attractiveness, stability and certainty equal to that of the company's enterprise. In fixing this net return the Board should take into consideration the rate of interest which the company is obliged to pay upon its bonds as a result of having to sell them at a time when the rate of interest payable thereon exceeded that payable on bonds issued at the time of the hearing. To properly fix a fair return the Board must necessarily be informed of the rate of return which money would yield in other fields of investment. Having gone into the matter fully in 1922, and having fixed 10% as a fair return under the conditions then existing, all the Board needed to know, in order to fix a proper return in 1927, was whether or not the conditions of the money market had altered, and, if so, in what direction, and to what extent.\nFor the city it was argued that, as one of the statutory powers of the Board was to deal with the financial affairs of local authorities (s. 20 (d)), and as this included the power to authorize the issue of new debentures by these authorities and to determine the rate of interest to be paid thereon and also the power to order a variation of the rate of interest payable upon any debt of the local authority (s. 103), the Board must necessarily be familiar with the rate of interest prevailing from time to time and therefore did not require to have witnesses called to furnish it with information which in the regular performance of its duty it was obliged to possess. In view of the powers and duties of the Board under the Act there is, in my opinion, considerable to be said for the city's contention. It is not necessary, however, to determine this question, for in the statute itself I find sufficient to justify the conclusion that the intention of the Legislature was to leave it largely to the discretion of the Board to say in what manner it should obtain the information required for the proper exercise of its functions. The material provisions of the Act on this point are as follows:\u2014\n21. (4) The Board may in its discretion accept and act upon evidence by affidavit or written affirmation or by the report of any officer or engineer appointed by it or obtained in such other manner as it may decide.\n(5) All hearings and investigations before the Board shall be governed by rules adopted by the Board, and in the conduct thereof the Board shall not be bound by the technical rules of legal evidence.\nSection 25 provides that upon a complaint being made to the Board that any proprietor of a public utility has unlawfully done or unlawfully failed to do something relating to a matter over which the Board has jurisdiction, the Board shall \"after hearing such evidence as it may think fit to require\" make such order as it thinks fit under the circumstances. Section 43 provides that the Board may \"appoint or direct any person to make an inquiry and report upon any application * * * before the Board.\" And by section 44 the Board may \"review, rescind, change, alter or vary any decision or order made by it.\" A perusal of these statutory provisions and a consideration of the purposes of the Act and the extent of the powers vested in the Board leads me to the conclusion that the Legislature intended to create a Board which in the exercise of its functions should not be bound by the technical rules of legal evidence but which would be governed by such rules as, in its discretion, it thought fit to adopt (s. 21 (5)). We have not been made acquainted with the rules, if any, adopted by the Board to govern its investigations. Nor do we know what information it possessed as to the altered conditions of the money market; but, as it had authority to act on evidence \"obtained in such manner as it may decide\" (s. 21 (4)), an inference that it had not the proper evidence before it cannot be drawn from the fact that no oral testimony in respect thereof was given at the hearing. If, in this case, the Board had asked its secretary to inquire from the various financial institutions in Edmonton if there had been any alteration in the conditions of the money market between 1922 and 1927, and the secretary had reported that there had been a certain decrease in the returns from invested capital, would it have been necessary to call witnesses to verify the report? In my opinion it would not. Nor would it have been necessary to afford to either party an opportunity to controvert before the Board the information so obtained. Then would it have been necessary to mention in the award that the fact that such altered conditions had been established to the satisfaction of the Board by a report of its secretary? I can find nothing in the Act requiring mention to be made of the evidence or of the manner of obtaining it.\nReference was made to s. 86, which provides that no order involving any outlay, loss or depreciation to the proprietor of any public utility or to any municipality or person shall be made without due notice and full opportunity to all parties concerned to make proof to be heard at a public sitting of the Board, except in the case of urgency. A reduction in the rate of return to the company would, in my opinion, come within this section. The Board was, therefore, without jurisdiction to make the reduction unless the company had notice that a reduction was sought and had an opportunity of proving that under the circumstances existing at the time of the hearing the existing rate of return was fair and reasonable. That the company had notice that the city was demanding a reduction is beyond question (par. 23 (e)). It had more. It had notice that the city was attacking the methods and principles adopted in fixing the rate of return in 1922. This, in my opinion, put the whole question of a fair return at large and informed the company that it would have to establish to the satisfaction of the Board every element and condition necessary to justify a continuation of the 10% rate. The company does not say that it was refused an opportunity of putting in evidence as to the conditions of the money market. Nowhere does it deny that it could have put in evidence had it so desired. What it does say is that the city did not adduce evidence on the point and that no witnesses were called to testify before the Board in regard thereto. There is nothing before us to justify an inference that the company was not at liberty to call witnesses as to the conditions of the money market had it so desired. Moreover, in the order which the company obtained giving it leave to appeal it did not even suggest that it had no opportunity of submitting evidence as to the existing market conditions. The ground upon which the company relied to meet the city's demand for a reduction, as set out in the answer which it filed, was that as the city had ac- cepted the award when it was delivered and had raised no objection thereto, it was now precluded from seeking to set aside the principles upon which the rate of return was based. In its factum it went further and contended that, even if there was no estoppel, the principles then adopted should now be adhered to because it was on the strength of their having been adopted that the shareholders of the company invested their money in the enterprise. This contention cannot be made effective. In the first place, it involves neither a question of jurisdiction nor of law. In the second place, it is the duty of the Board to fix rates which, in its opinion, will be fair and reasonable at the time the order is made and for the period for which they are fixed. If any wrong principle or erroneous view has been adopted it is the duty of the Board at the next revision to correct the error. The argument that it would be unfair to the shareholders now to alter the rate of return is not a matter open for consideration on appeal. Moreover, when these shareholders invested their money they knew that the rates fixed were to be in force for three years only and that it would be the duty of the Board on the next revision to fix rates which at that time would be fair and reasonable under the circumstances then existing.\nOur attention was also called to s. 47 (1a) as indicating an intention that evidence must be taken on all material points. That subsection reads as follows:\u2014\n(1a) On the hearing of any appeal referred to in subsection 1 of this section no evidence other than the evidence which was submitted to the Board upon the making of the order appealed from shall be admitted, and the Court shall proceed either to confirm or vacate the order appealed from, and in the latter event shall refer the matter back to the Board for further consideration and redetermination.\nIn my opinion this subsection means no more than that no new evidence is to be admitted on appeal.\nThe appeal of the company should therefore be dismissed with costs.\nThe appeal of the city should likewise be dismissed with costs. The items which should be included in the rate base cannot, in my opinion, be considered a question of jurisdiction or of law.\nSMITH J.\u2014The City of Edmonton had made an agreement with the Northern Alberta Natural Gas Development Company, by which the company obtained a fran- chise to supply natural gas to the city, and agreed to construct the necessary works. The company failed to construct the works, and the city sued for damages for breach of contract. The actions were settled by an agreement dated 22nd August, 1922, under which the determination of the rates to be charged by the company for gas was referred to the Board of Public Utility Commissioners, and the company was, within six months after the fixing of the rates, to deposit $50,000 with the city, which was to be forfeited to the city as liquidated damages in case the company did not complete the construction of the works as agreed.\nA rate hearing was held by the Board after this settlement, at which the company and the city were represented, and the Board made an award, setting out a rate basis and fixing prices for gas on this basis.\nThe difficulty about proceeding with the works had been the procuring of capital on the basis of prices provided in the original agreement and amendments made. The whole object of fixing a rate base and prices in advance of construction was to facilitate financing by the company. It would necessarily be on the basis of the award that investors would buy bonds and stock of the company. The company had the option of proceeding with the works or abandoning them and forfeiting the $50,000, after seeing the award. In July following the making of the award, the company assigned its franchise and property to the appellant, the Northwestern Utilities, Limited, which, by sale of its bonds and stock, raised the necessary capital, constructed the works, and put them in operation. The rate to be charged for gas was fixed by the award for three years, and at the end of this period the company applied to the Board for continuation of the rates fixed by the award. The rate base fixed by the Board in the award of 1922 contained many items, such as total investment, operating cost, depletion reserve, reserve for repayment of cost of plant, total necessary revenue, amounts of gas to be sold, and the rate of return on capital to be allowed. It is evident that, with the exception of the last of these items, the amounts fixed must have been estimates, liable to be varied by actual results. The rate of return to be allowed on capital was fixed in the award at 10%, not based on the ordinary rate of money on the market at the time or on an estimated future rate, but on consideration of the rate that would induce investors to risk their capital in an extremely hazardous and doubtful venture. At the hearing before the Board in 1922, the company had asked a 12% rate of return on capital, and the city had conceded 10%, which the Board fixed, though it stated that under the circumstances a return of more than 10% would not seem to be unjust. The reason set out for not fixing this higher rate was that it might so restrict the market that the higher rate would not compensate for the restriction of the market, and would therefore not be to the advantage of the company. It is, however, stated that in case of future revision, it may be found desirable, under certain circumstances, to increase this rate.\nOn the revision at the end of three years, this rate was not increased, but was reduced from 10% to 9%, at the instance of the city, and this reduction constitutes the ground of appeal.\nIn the reasons given by the Board in fixing the new rates, it is pointed out that, where rates have been fixed in advance of construction and financing, the Board is not precluded from subsequently making changes that may appear from subsequent reconsideration to be necessary, and it is then stated that\nthose investing in such a case must depend on the fairness of the Board in seeing that the Company is allowed a fair and reasonable return upon its investment, but the Board may, and indeed it should, take into consideration the circumstances under which such investment was made.\nIn discussing these circumstances in reference to a request by the city for elimination from the rate base of the 1922 award of the item for bond discount, the Board says:\nThere is, moreover, an additional factor to be considered in the present case and that is, that in 1922 the inclusion of the allowance for bond discount was practically agreed to by the city in its case and the item was not questioned by the city until at the recent hearing. It is only fair to assume that the fact of the inclusion of the bond discount in the rate base formed part of the inducement for the making of the investment. Under the circumstances, therefore, the Board does not feel justified in adopting the City's contention in this regard.\nThis lays down a principle with which one heartily agrees, and which applies exactly to the city's application for reduction of the rate of return on capital fixed in the award of 1922 at 10%. The Board fixed this rate with the assent of the city, and this rate, coupled with the suggestion by the Board that it might be increased, \"formed part of the inducement for the making of the investment.\"\nThe altered condition of the money market, given as a reason for the reduction of the rate to 9%, seems to me to have no bearing on the matter. The representation to the investor in 1922 was, for the risk you take in placing your capital in a hazardous undertaking, you will be allowed as a basis in fixing rates to be charged for gas a return of 10%. What the regular money market might be three years later could have nothing to do with the decision to invest. The whole question was, viewing the risk, and the chances, as matters then stood, was the chance of 10% on the money worth the risk of a bad investment, with the possibility of the loss of all or part of the capital?\nThe Board then, in my opinion, laid down a proper principle, and applied it in other instances, but failed to apply it to this item, as to which I think it was particularly applicable. The question is, can this Court set aside the finding of the Board as to this item on the appeal? I agree with my brother Lamont that, whether or not under the Act the Board was entitled to reduce the rate to 9% without evidence, because of a change in money market conditions, is a question of law, and that there is therefore a right of appeal, and it is with some regret that I feel bound to agree with him that the Board had jurisdiction to make the change in rate without evidence, and without giving the company an opportunity to offer evidence. The question of a fair rate of return on a risky investment is largely a matter of opinion, and is hardly capable of being reduced to certainty by evidence, and appears to be one of the things entrusted by the statute to the judgment of the Board.\nI am not entirely in accord with the observations of my brother Lamont in reference to the sending out of someone to gather evidence of the state of the money market and acting on that party's report without the knowledge of the company. The objection in such a case would not be the failure to set out in the award the fact of such evidence and its nature, but the failure to disclose it to the company with an opportunity to answer it. If it were a case where, evi- dence toeing necessary, it had been taken in the manner suggested, or otherwise, and a finding based on it without disclosure of it to the company and an opportunity to answer it, I would regard such a proceeding as contrary to elementary principles of justice, and as affording, under the statute, a ground for setting the award as to this item aside and referring it back for reconsideration. It does not, however, appear that any evidence was taken, and as stated, I have concluded that there was power to make the change without evidence.\nI therefore concur with my brother Lamont in the disposal of this appeal.\nAppeals dismissed with costs.\n",

Act, ss. 91, 92, 102 to 126.\nThe questions referred to this court by the Governor General in Council were answered as follows:[1] Question 1 (a). Where the bed of a navigable river is vested in the Crown in the right of the province, is the title subordinate to the public right of navigation?\nQuestion 1 (b). If not, has the Dominion the legislative power to declare that such title is subordinate to such right?\nAnswer: The questions as framed postulate the existence of a public right of navigation in the rivers to which they refer, as well as their navigability.\nThe title to the bed of the river is subject to that public right, except in so far as, at the date of the Union, the Crown possessed by law or has since acquired, under Dominion legislation, a superior right to use or to grant the use of the waters of the river for other purposes, such for example, as mining, irrigation or industry.\nQuestion 2. Where the bed of a navigable river is vested in the Crown in the right of the province, has the Dominion power, for navigation purposes, to use or occupy part of such bed or to divert, diminish, or change the flow over such bed (a) without the consent of the province; (b) without compensation?\nQuestion 3. Has the Parliament of Canada the power, by appropriate legislative enactment, to authorize the Dominion Government to expropriate the lands of the Crown in the right of the province for the purposes of navigation with provision or without provision for compensation?\nAnswer: These questions cannot be answered categorically either in the affirmative or in the negative.\nThe conditions controlling the exercise of Dominion legislative powers for purposes embraced within the comprehensive phrase, \u201cnavigation purposes,\u201d depend in part upon the nature of the \u201cpurpose,\u201d in part upon the nature of the means proposed for accomplishing it, and in part upon the character of the particular power called into play. Reference is respectfully made to the observations in the accompanying reasons, as indicating the governing principles with as much definiteness as is safe or practicable.\nQuestion 4. By section 108 of the British North America Act, 1867, and the first item of the Third Schedule thereto, the following public works and property of each: province, amongst others, shall be the property of Canada, namely \u201cCanals with lands and water-power connected therewith.\u201d\nHas the province any proprietary interest in or beneficial ownership of or legislative control over the water-power which, though connected with the said canals, is created or made available by reason of extensions, enlargements or replacements of said canals made by the Dominion since Confederation and which is not required from time to time for the purpose of navigation?\nQuestion 5. Where the bed of a navigable river is vested in the Crown in the right of the province, has the province any proprietary interest in or beneficial ownership of or legislative control over the water-power created or made available by works for the improvement of navigation constructed thereupon in whole or in part by or under the authority of the Dominion since Confederation which is not required from time to time for the purposes of navigation? Answer: Whatever subjects are comprehended under the phrase \u201cWater-Power\u201d in the 1st item of the third schedule, by section 106 passed to the Dominion, there was left to the provinces neither proprietary interest in, nor beneficial ownership of such subjects; and under section 91 (1) legislative control over them is exclusively committed to the Dominion.\nAs to water-powers (and these of course, are not comprised within that item) \u201ccreated or made available by reason of extensions, enlargements or replacements made by the Dominion since Confederation\u201d or \u201cby works for the improvement of navigation constructed * * * in whole or in part since Confederation,\u201d it is impossible to ascertain the respective powers or rights of the Dominion and the provinces in relation thereto, in the absence of a more precise statement as to the character of the works, as to the legislative authority under which the works were executed, and as to the circumstances pertinent to the question whether or not the conditions of such authority were duly observed.\nQuestion 6 (a). Has the Dominion exclusive proprietary interest in or beneficial ownership of or legislative control over water-powers created or made available by works authorized by Parliament to be erected in any boundary waters for the purpose of carrying out a treaty between His Majesty and a foreign country providing for the erection of joint works for (1) the improvement of navigation in such waters, or (2) for the development of power, or (3) for both?\nThe expression \u201cboundary waters\u201d in this question means the waters defined by the preliminary article of the Treaty dated 11th January, 1909, between His Britannic Majesty and the United States of America.\nQuestion 6 (b). If the Dominion has not the exclusive proprietary interest in or beneficial ownership of or legislative control over such water-powers, has the province the exclusive proprietary interest in or beneficial ownership of or legislative control over such water-powers?\nAnswer: The nature and extent of the respective powers, rights and interests of the Dominion and the provinces in, and in respect of such water-powers, would depend upon a variety of facts, including, inter alia, the terms of the Treaty, and the respective rights of the Dominion and the provinces in, and in relation to, the waters affected. In the absence of information as to such facts, it is impracticable to give an intelligible answer to the questions propounded.\nQuestion 7. Has the Parliament of Canada legislative power to authorize the construction and operation by the Dominion Government of works wholly for power purposes and the acquisition by purchase or expropriation of the lands and property required for the purposes of such works including lands of the Crown in the right of a province (a) in inter-provincial rivers; and (b) in provincial rivers?\n\u201cInterprovincial rivers\u201d in this question means rivers flowing along or across the boundaries between provinces.\nAnswer: As to both \u201c provincial rivers\u201d and \u201cinterprovincial rivers,\u201d Parliament has jurisdiction in respect of such works, if they fall within the ambit of sec. 92 (10a). With reference to the expropriation of provincial Crown lands \u201cfor the purposes of such works,\u201d the answer to the question would, to some extent, depend upon the particular purpose for which such lands were required. In answering this question, sec. 92 (10c) is not taken into account. Reference is respectfully made to what has been said upon that subject in the accompanying reasons.\nQuestion 8. May a province notwithstanding the construction by the Dominion for the purposes of navigation of works in a river the bed of which is within such province, control, regulate and use the waters in such river so long as such control, regulation and use does not interfere with navigation? In the case of a river flowing between two provinces may such provinces jointly control, regulate and use the water in the same manner?\nQuestion 9. Has a province the right to control or use the waters in provincial rivers and to develop or authorize the development of water-powers within the province provided that in so doing navigation is not prejudiced and that the province complies with Dominion requirements as to navigation?\nAnswer: These two questions mutually overlap, and it is convenient to deal with them together. If there is no valid conflicting legislation by the Dominion under an overriding power\u2014the power for example bestowed upon the Dominion by sec. 92 (10a)\u2014the several provinces have the rights which are the subject of interrogatory number 9.\nAs to the first branch of the eighth question. The authority of the provinces to \u201ccontrol, regulate and use\u201d such waters, in the circumstances mentioned, is subject to the condition that, in the exercise thereof, the provinces do not interfere in matters the control of which is reserved exclusively for the Dominion, and that all valid enactments of the Dominion, in relation to the navigation works, or in relation to navigable waters, be duly observed.\nThis condition is not necessarily identical with the condition expressed in the question by the words \u201cso long as such control, regulation and use does not interfere with navigation.\u201d The question therefore, in the form in which it is put, cannot be answered in the affirmative; and, as the exercise of legislative jurisdiction, in the comprehensive terms of the question, might encroach upon the exclusive jurisdiction of the Dominion, the proper answer seems to be in the negative.\nAs to the second branch, considering the variety of meanings which might attach to the phrase \u201cjointly control, regulate and use,\u201d no precise or useful answer is possible.\nThe answers to these questions, conformably to the views adverted to above, also proceed upon the assumption that the questions have no reference to any jurisdiction which might be acquired by the procedure laid down in sec. 92 (10c).\nQuestion 10. (a) If question 4 is answered in the affirmative, what is the nature or extent of such interest or ownership or control?\n(b) If question 5 is answered in the affirmative, what is the nature or extent of such interest or ownership or control?\n(c) If the answers to both questions 6 (a) and 6 (b) are in the negative, what are the respective rights and interests of the Dominion and the provinces in relation to such water-powers?\nAnswer: In view of what has already been stated in response to the 4th, 5th and 6th interrogatories, no answer to this question is called for. REFERENCE by His Excellency the Governor General in Council to the Supreme Court of Canada, under and pursuant to the Supreme Court Act, of certain questions for hearing and consideration as to the relative rights of the Dominion and Provinces in relation to the proprietary interest in and legislative control over waters with respect to navigation and water-powers created or made available by or in connection with works for the improvement of navigation.\nThe first Order in Council providing for the reference, dated 14th April, 1928 (P.C. 592), was as follows:\u2014\n\u201cThe Committee of the Privy Council have had before them a report, dated 13th April, 1928, from the Minister of Justice, submitting that at the conference of representatives of the Dominion and Provincial Governments held at Ottawa in the month of November, 1927, the Premiers of certain of the Provinces questioned the right of the Dominion to water-powers created or made available by the erection of Dominion works for the improvement of navigation and asserted a right on the part of the Provinces to such water-powers within the limite of the Province.\n\u201cThe Minister observes that in the discussion which followed with regard to this claim and also with regard to the whole question of the division of legislative control over and: proprietary interest in water-powers it was found impossible to reach any general agreement as between the Dominion and the Provinces, and in the result a request was made by the Premiers of Ontario and Quebec that the Dominion undertake to submit a case to the Supreme Court of Canada for hearing and consideration.\n\u201cIn pursuance of this request, Your Excellency was pleased, by Order in Council of the 18th January, 1928, (P.C. 115), passed on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice, to refer certain questions to the Supreme Court of Canada for hearing and consideration pursuant to section 60 of the Supreme Court Act.\n\u201cThe Minister states that the statistics show that the inland water-borne commerce of the Dominion has attained to great dimensions and with the growth and settlement of the country will involve large future expenditures for improvements of the extensive waterways comprising the inland navigation of the Dominion.\n\u201cThe Minister submits that owing to the great importance of the questions in controversy, it was considered advisable to consult with representatives of the Provinces with respect to the questions to be submitted, and such conference having been held it was deemed advisable to revise the said questions and to submit additional questions, viz., Nos. 8 and 9 hereinafter set out, at the request of representatives of the Province of Ontario.\n\u201cThe Minister accordingly recommends that Order in Council of the 18th January, 1928 (P.C. 115) be rescinded, and that, pursuant to the powers in that behalf conferred by section 60 of the Supreme Court Act, Your Excellency may be pleased to refer to the Supreme Court of Canada for hearing and consideration the following questions:\u2014\n1. (a) Where the bed of a navigable river is vested in the\nCrown in the right of the Province, is the title subordinate to the public right of navigation?\n(b) If not, has the Dominion the legislative power to declare that such title is subordinate to such right?\n2. Where the bed of a navigable river is vested in the Crown in the right of the Province, has the Dominion power, for navigation purposes, to use or occupy part of such bed or to divert, diminish, change the flow over such bed (a) without the consent of the Province; (b) without compensation?\n3. Has the Parliament of Canada the power, by appropriate legislative enactment to authorize the Dominion Government to expropriate the lands of the Crown in the right of the Province for the purposes of navigation with provision or without provision for compensation?\n4. By section 108 of the British North America Act, 1867, and the first item of the Third Schedule thereto, the following public works and property of each province, amongst others, shall be the property of Canada, namely, \u201cCanals with lands and water-power conected therewith.\u201d\nHas the Province any proprietary interest in or beneficial ownership of or legislative control over the water-power which, though connected with the said canals, is created or made available by reason of extensions, enlargements or replacements of said canals made by the Dominion since Confederation and which is not required from time to time for the purposes of navigation? If so, what is the nature or extent of such interest or ownership or control?\n5. Where the bed of a navigable river is vested in the Crown in the right of the province, has the province any proprietary interest in or beneficial ownership of or legislative control over the water-power created or made available by works of the improvement of navigation constructed thereupon in whole or in part by or under the authority of the Dominion since Confederation, which is not required from time to time for the purposes of navigation? If so, what is the nature or extent of such interest, ownership or control?\n6. (a) Has the Dominion the exclusive proprietary interest in or beneficial ownership of or legislative control over water-powers created or made available by works authorized by Parliament to be erected in any boundary waters for the purpose of carrying out a treaty between His Majesty and a foreign country providing for the erection of joint works for (i) the improvement of navigation in such waters, or (ii) for the development of power, or (iii) for both\nThe expression \u201cboundary waters\u201d in this question means the waters defined by the preliminary article of the Treaty dated 11th January, 1909, between His Britannic Majesty and the United States of America.\n(b) If the Dominion has not the exclusive proprietary interest in or beneficial ownership of or legislative control over such water-powers, has the Province the exclusive proprietary interest in or beneficial ownership of or legislative control over such water-powers?\n(c) If neither the Dominion nor the Province has the exclusive proprietary interest in or beneficial ownership of or legislative control over such water-powers, what are their respective rights and interests in relation to such water-powers?\n7. Has the Parliament of Canada legislative power to authorize the construction and operation by the Dominion Government of works wholly for power purposes and the acquisition by purchase or expropriation of the lands and property required for the purposes of such works including lands of the Crown in the right of a province (a) in interprovincial rivers; and (b) in provincial rivers?\n\u201cInterprovincial rivers\u201d in this question means rivers flowing along or across the boundaries between provinces.\n8. May a province notwithstanding the construction by the Dominion for the purposes of navigation of works\u2019 in a river the bed of which is within such province, control, regulate and use the waters in such river so long as such control, regulation and use does not interfere with navigation? In the case of a river flowing between two provinces may such provinces jointly control, regulate and use the water in the same manner?\n9. Has a Province the right to control or use the waters in provincial rivers and to develop or authorize the development of water-powers within the province provided that in so doing navigation is not prejudiced and that the province complies with Dominion requirements as to navigation?\n\u201cThe Committee concur in the foregoing and advise that Your Excellency may be pleased to refer the said questions to the Supreme Court of Canada for hearing and consideration, accordingly.\u201d\nA second Order in Council, rearranging questions, dated 31st May, 1928 (P.C. 921), was as follows:\u2014\n\u201cThe Committee of the Privy Council have had before them a report, dated 29th May, 1928, from the Minister of Justice, stating that by Order in Council dated 14th April, 1928 (P.C. 592), certain questions touching the rights of the Dominion and the Provinces, respectively, in relation to the proprietary interest in, and legislative control over, waters with respect to navigation and water-powers created or made available by or in connection with works for the improvement of navigation, were referred to the Supreme Court of Canada for hearing and consideration pursuant to section 60 of the Supreme Court Act;\n\u201cThe Minister observes that the said Court have suggested to counsel for the Attorney-General of Canada that it would be more convenient in considering and answering the questions if the concluding sentence of questions Nos. 4 and 5 and paragraph (c) of question No. 6 were transposed from their present position and consolidated in a new question, to be added as question No. 10.\n\u201cThe Committee, on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice, advise that the questions set forth in Order in Council of the 14th April, 1928 (P.C. 592), be rearranged in accordance with the suggestion of the Supreme Court of Canada, and that the said questions, so rearranged, be as follows:\u2014\n1. (No change.)\n2. (No change.)\n3. (No change.)\n4. By section 108 of the British North America Act, 1867, and the first item of the Third Schedule thereto, the following public works and property of each province amongst others, shall be the property of Canada, namely, \u201cCanals with lands and water-power connected therewith.\u201d\nHas the Province any proprietary interest in or beneficial ownership of or legislative control over the water-power which, though connected with the said canals, is created or made available by reason of extensions, enlargements or replacements of said canals made by the Dominion since Confederation and which is not required from time to time for the purposes of navigation?\n5. Where the bed of a navigable river is vested in the Crown in the right of the province, has the province any proprietary interest in or beneficial ownership of or legislative control over the water-power created or made available by works for the improvement of navigation constructed thereupon in whole or in part by or under the authority of the Dominion since Confederation which is not required from time to time for the purposes of navigation?\n6. (a) Has the Dominion the exclusive proprietary interest in or beneficial ownership of or legislative control over water-powers created or made available by works authorized by Parliament to be erected in any boundary waters for the purpose of carrying out a treaty between His Majesty and a foreign country providing for the erection of joint works for (i) the improvement of navigation in such waters, or (ii) for the development of power, or (iii) for both?\nThe expression \u201cboundary waters\u201d in this question means the water\u2019s defined by the preliminary article of the Treaty dated 11th January, 1909, between His Britannic Majesty and the United States of America.\n6. (b) If the Dominion has not the exclusive proprietory interest in or beneficial ownership of or legislative control over such water-powers, has the Province the exclusive proprietary interest in or beneficial ownership of or legislative control over such water-powers?\n7. (No change.)\n8. (No change.)\n9. (No change.)\n10. (a) If question 4 is answered in the affirmative, what is the nature or extent of such interest or ownership or control?\n(b) If question 5 is answered in the affirmative, what is the nature or extent of such interest or ownership or control?\n(c) If the answers to both questions 6 (a) and 6 (b) are in the negative, what are the respective rights and intereste of the Dominion and the Provinces in relation to such water-powers?\nPursuant to an order of the Court, notification of the hearing of the reference was sent to the Attorneys General of all the provinces and was published in the Canada Gazette. The Attorneys General of the Provinces of Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia, Manitoba and Saskatchewan were represented by counsel at the hearing.\nN. W. Rowell K.C., C Laurendeau K.C., H. J. Symington K.C., C.P. Plaxton K.C., and V. C Macdonald for the Attorney General of Canada.\nW. N. Tilley K.C., S. Johnston, K.C., and C.F.H. Carson for the province of Ontario.\nE. Lafleur K.C., C. Lanctot K.C., and A. Geoffrion K.C. for the province of Quebec.\nE.B. Ryckman K.C., I. F. Strachan and J. E. Lane for the province of British Columbia.\nF. H. Chrysler K.C. for the province of Manitoba.\nH. Fisher K.C. for the province of Saskatchewan.\nThe judgment of the Court[2] was delivered by\nDuff J.\u2014Certain interrogatories have been referred to us by the Governor General in Council concerning chiefly the distribution of public assets and legislative powers under the B.N.A. Act. They particularly relate to the scope of the legislative authority of the Dominion under certain of the enumerated heads of section 91, considered in connection with the authority of the provincial legislatures under section 92, and under the group of sections beginning with section 102 and ending with section 126, dealing with assets, revenue and sources of revenue. By the last mentioned group of sections, the assets, duties and revenues, including the sources of revenue over which the legislatures of the confederated provinces possessed the power of appropriation at the date of the Union, were distributed, and assigned in part to the control of the Dominion Parliament, and in part to that of the provincial legislatures. Attorney-General of Ontario v. Mercer[3]. The sources of revenue assigned to the provinces as well as the revenues derived from them, and the revenues raised under the special powers conferred by the Act, were to remain vested in the Crown, as the Sovereign Head of the several provinces, but were to be \u201csubject to the administration and control\u201d of the legislatures of those provinces. St. Catherines Milling and Lumber Company v. The Queen[4], and Liquidators of the Maritime Bank of Canada v. The Receiver-General of New Brunswick[5]. By the same series of sections, provision was made for the assumption by Canada of the burden of the public debts of the several provinces, within limits designated by the Act for each province, and for the payment, by the Dominion, according to a prescribed scale, of an annual grant to each of the provinces; which grants were to be \u201cin full settlement of all future demands on Canada.\u201d By section 91, the Dominion was given power to raise money, by any mode or system of taxation, and by section 92, each of the provinces was given the power to raise a revenue for provincial purposes by direct taxation, and by means of licenses.\nIt has never been suggested that either the Dominion alone or a province alone is entitled to alter the terms of this arrangement for the distribution of assets, liabilities and sources of revenue.\nIn the Ontario Mining Co. v. Seybold[6], the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council had to consider whether the Dominion Parliament, without the concurrence of Ontario, in the exercise of its legislative authority over Indians and lands reserved for Indians, could, after the surrender of the Indian title by the North West Anglo Treaty of 31st October, 1873, for the purposes of an Indian reserve, for which provision was made by that treaty, set out and appropriate portions of the land surrendered as reserves for the use of the Indians. Their Lordships negatived any such power in express terms (page 82), and held that such an appropriation could only be effected by the joint action of the two governments; a conclusion in which the Dominion and Ontario had, by legislative agreement, already concurred. Their Lordships declared (page 79) that the right of disposing of Crown lands\ncan only be exercised by the Crown under the advise of the Ministers of the Dominion or the province, as the case may be, to which the beneficial use of the land or its proceeds has been appropriated, and by an instrument under the seal of the Dominion or the province. This decision of 1902 proceeded upon the principle of earlier judgments delivered in 1898, in the first Fisheries case, Atty. Gen. for Canada v. Atty. Gen. for Ontario[7], and in the St. Catherine Milling and Lumber Company\u2019s case[8] already mentioned, which was decided in 1888. In the first Fisheries case7, their Lordships had to pass upon the validity of an enactment of the Parliament of Canada (R.S.C, c 95, s. 4) empowering the Governor in Council to grant fishery leases. Their Lordships decided that \u201cin so far as\u201d it empowered\nthe grant of fishery leases conferring an exclusive right to fish in property belonging not to the Dominion but to the provinces, it was not within the jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament to pass it.\nThe legislative authority in respect to \u201cFisheries,\u201d conferred upon the Dominion Parliament by section 91, does not, it was held, involve the power to deal with the property of a province as if the administration of that property had been entrusted by the B.N.A. Act, to the control of the Dominion Parliament; for, as Lord Herschell, who delivered the judgment of the Board, said, such a ruling would enable the Dominion to\ntransfer to itself property which had by the B.N.A. Act been left to the provinces and not vested in it. (p. 713).\nThe effect of the decisions seems to be, that neither the Dominion nor a province can take possession of a source of revenue which has been assigned to the other, and as a source of revenue, appropriate it to itself, nor, as owner, transfer it to another.\nThis, of course, is not to say that the Dominion in exercising its legislative authority under section 91, may not legislate in such a way as to affect the proprietary rights of a province. It is plain that in consequence of legislation on the subject, for example, of Fisheries, the provinces may be very greatly restricted in the exercise of their proprietary rights; but so long as the Dominion legislation truly concerns the subject of \u201cFisheries,\u201d as that subject is envisaged by section 91, such legislation has the force of law, however harmful, or even foolish, it may appear to be. Within the limits of the subject matters assigned to it, the authority of the Dominion is supreme, and no court of justice has jurisdiction to take cognizance of any complaint that such authority has been abused. The extent to which the provincial legislatures may be restricted in, or excluded from, the control of provincial property by the enactment of Dominion laws operative under section 91 cannot be defined in the abstract. That depends primarily upon the character of the particular authority which the Dominion is exercising. On the present Reference, the discussion has been largely concerned with the legislative authority of the Dominion Parliament in relation to the permanent occupation of Provincial Crown lands, and the permanent diversion and alteration of the flow of rivers and streams in derogation of the rights of a province, as proprietor of the beds of such rivers and streams, for purposes which have been compendiously styled, in the interrogatories, \u201cnavigation purposes.\u201d\nBefore proceeding to a consideration of some of the points debated, it is necessary to notice the distinction, now well settled, between those matters, which, according to the true construction of the words designating the subject or subjects faling under a \u201cspecially enumerated\u201d head of s. 91, are strictly and necessarily within the limits of those subjects, so that legislation in relation to such matters, by a province, is in no circumstances competent; and other matters, which, though not necessarily or strictly falling within such subjects, may be dealt with by Dominion legislation under some power arising by implication, because such implied power is requisite to enable the Dominion fully to perform the legislative functions devolving upon it in relation to the designated subject or subjects. With regard to such last mentioned matters, provincial legislation, dealing with them in their provincial aspects, may be competent and operative, until superseded or overborne by some valid enactment passed by the Dominion, having relation to their Dominion aspects.\nThere is one subject in relation to which it has been expressly held that the exclusive authority of the Dominion, within the strict limits traced by the language of s. 91 involves the power to legislate for the taking and using of provincial Crown lands for the purposes for which the authority was bestowed. In legislating for railways extending beyond provincial limits, it has been held, that it is of the essence of the Dominion authority to define the course of the railway, and to authorize the construction and working of the railway along that course, without regard to the ownership of the lands through which it may pass (Attorney General for Quebec v. Nipissing Central Ry. Co.[9]) \u201crailway legislation, strictly so called\u201d (in respect of such railways), is within the exclusive competence of the Dominion, and such legislation may include, inter alia (Canadian Pacific Ry. v. Corporation of the Parish of Notre Dame de Bonsecours[10]), regulations for the construction, the repair and the alteration of the railway and for its management. In the circumstances of this country, a provincial right of interdiction upon the occupation of provincial Crown property lying upon the route of the railway is incompatible with either a plenary or an exclusive Dominion authority over the construction or working of such railways; and this would have been even more strikingly evident, in 1867. On the other hand, the authority granted by section 91, head 4, \u201cIndians and lands reserved for Indians,\u201d while it enables the Dominion to legislate fully and exclusively, upon matters falling strictly within the subject \u201cIndians,\u201d including, inter alia, the prescribing of residential areas for Indians, does not, as we have seen, embrace the power to appropriate a tract of provincial Crown land for the purposes of an Indian reserve, without the consent of the province, (Seybold\u2019s case[11]).\nSo also under head 12 of section 91, which invests the Dominion with jurisdiction to make laws in relation to all matters pertaining to the subjects, \u201cSeacoast and Inland Fisheries,\u201d it has been decided that the Dominion has no right to authorize, for the purposes of fishing in waters where there is a public right of fishing, the affixing of fishing apparatus to the solum, where that is the property of a province. The exclusive power to license such use of the solum is, according to this decision, committed to the province. Atty. Gen. for Quebec v. Atty. Gen. of Canada[12].\nAgain, there is judicial sanction for the view that the authority given to the Dominion under s. 91 (10), \u201cNavigation and shipping,\u201d does not, in its essence, include the power to authorize the permanent occupation of provincial lands for harbour works, or to vest the bed of a river belonging to a province in a Board of Harbour Commissioners for harbour purposes; that such a power, if it exists, is in the nature of an ancillary power, and can only be exercised upon the condition of paying compensation to the province. City of Montreal v. Harbour Commissioners of Montreal[13]; Reference re s. 189, Railway Act[14]; Atty. Gen. for Quebec v. Nipissing Central Ry. Co.[15].\nCounsel for the Dominion claim, under section 91, a much more sweeping jurisdiction. Legislative authority, under the enumerated heads of that section, being plenary, carries with it, it is argued, in virtue of that authority, the widest discretion touching the means to be employed for the advancement of any legislative scheme or purpose within the purview of any such enumerated head. To the extent to which it is considered advisable to do so, in order to proceed effectually in pursuit of its objects, Parliament, it is said, is clothed with the power to legislate, for affecting such proprietary rights, and indeed, where it is conceived to be necessary, for the transfer of such rights to the Dominion, or to others. In support of this view, the initial words of section 91 are invoked.\nIt is hereby declared that notwithstanding * *. * anything in this Act, the exclusive legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada extends to all matters coming within the subjects next hereinafter enumerated.\nFrom these words, coupled with the concluding paragraph of s. 91, the deduction is drawn that in construing and giving effect to the language of section 91, defining the powers of Parliament, you may disregard the provisions of the Act, already discussed, by which certain assets and sources of revenue are exclusively vested in the control of the provincial legislatures; in the sense that you may treat the rights of the provinces under those sections as upon the same plane as the proprietary rights of private individuals.\nIt was argued that, to deny to the Dominion Parliament an unrestricted discretion in disposing of provincial property for purposes within the enumerated heads of s. 91 is equivalent to denying the plenary character of the Dominion legislative authority; that the provincial contention in the opposite sense has no other basis than the possibility that legislative powers of the Dominion, as interpreted by the Dominion, in argument, might be abused to the injury of the provinces; a consideration inadmissible in a court of law.\nThere is nothing more clearly settled than the proposition that in construing section 91, its provisions must be read in light of the enactments of section 92, and of the other sections of the Act, and that where necessary, the prima facie scope of the language may be modified to give effect to the Act as a whole. It was recognized at an early stage in the judicial elucidation of the Act that any other principle of construction might have the effect of frustrating the intention of its authors who\ncould not have intended that the powers assigned exclusively to the provincial legislatures should be absorbed in those given to the Dominion Parliament.\nThe Citizens Ins. Co. of Canada v. Parsons[16]; Great West Saddlery Co. v. The King[17]; Atty. Gen. for Ontario v. Reciprocal Insurers[18]. The argument presented on behalf of the Dominion hardly does justice to this principle. The authority of the Dominion Parliament in relation to railways under section 92-10 (a) is a plenary authority, which prima facie would enable the Dominion to legislate fully in respect of such enterprises as the Intercolonial Railway, and the railway stipulated for in the Terms of Union with British Columbia. But it could hardly be argued, as the Dominion contention, carried to its logical conclusion, seemed to suggest, that the arrangement embodied in the B.N.A. Act as to the Intercolonial Railway, might, as to date of completion, for example, be amended at will by the Dominion in exercise of its authority to legislate in respect of interprovincial railways. Similar observations might be made with regard to the terms of Union with .Prince Edward Island, dealing with steamboat services. Then there are the provisions in sections 102-126 and the corresponding stipulations contained in the Terms of Union with British Columbia and with Prince Edward Island, touching the\napportionment of the burden of the debts of the provinces. The Dominion has, under section 91 (1), complete authority to legislate on the subject of the public debt, but it could hardly be contended that this authority would enable the Dominion to legislate in such a manner as to prejudice its obligations so constituted.\nThen it seems proper to call attention to s. 91 (3) of the Act, and to contrast the unrestricted language of that head with section 125.\nIt is perhaps not superfluous to observe that the provisions of the Order in Council, setting forth the terms of the agreement, in pursuance of which British Columbia entered the Union, in so far as they concern the subjects of revenue and assets, were treated by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the Precious Metals case, The Atty. Gen. of British Columbia v. The Atty. Gen. of Canada[19], as constituting a modification of the provisions of the principal statute, in sections 102-126, dealing with the same subjects, and as having, in virtue of s. 146 of the B.N.A. Act, precisely the same force as those provisions.\nThe view cannot be accepted that, by the enactments of s. 91, the Dominion, in execution of its legislative powers under that section, is empowered to rewrite the terms of the agreements under which British Columbia and Prince Edward Island entered the Union; and that being so, it cannot be maintained that it is competent to the Dominion in exercise of such powers to legislate in disregard of the provisions of sections 102-126.\nIn considering the effect of the phrase \u201cnotwithstanding anything in this Act\u201d one must not overlook the fact that it is only the \u201cexclusive authority\u201d of the Dominion under the enumerated heads of s. 91 which is accorded the primacy intended to be declared by those words. In themselves they have not the effect of giving pre-eminence to the incidental or ancillary power; which are not strictly exclusive. As already observed, in recent pronouncements touching the appropriation of Provincial Crown property in professed exercise of such powers, support is given to the view that, if such appropriation be permissible in exercise of them, then the payment of compensation may be a condition of that exercise; and there appears to be, it may be added, no decision, and, except in the observations in the judgments referred to, no dictum, giving any support to the view that in virtue of an ancillary or incidental power the Dominion Parliament is entitled to authorize the permanent occupation of Provincial Crown property.\nThe task of reconciling the various sections of the Act is one of great difficulty. You must give full effect to the exclusive powers of the Dominion under section 91; yet in ascertaining the scope of those powers you must have regard to the other provisions of the Act. The character of the exclusive power may be such, on the true construction of section 91, as to involve the right to take, or to give to others, possession of Provincial Crown property, for the purpose of executing the power. The decisions already cited seem to show that such a conclusion must be founded on solid, not to say demonstrative, considerations; but, where the right is unmistakably involved in the authority given, then, of course, to that right effect must be given. But although the Dominion may, by legislation enacted in exercise of its exclusive powers relating to railways and canals, authorize the construction through the property of a province of a railway or canal, to which its jurisdiction extends, this does not involve the right to appropriate the whole beneficial interest of the site of the work (including the minerals, for example), for the purpose of making it available as an asset or source of revenue for the benefit of the Dominion or of the Dominion\u2019s grantees, where that site is vested in His Majesty and is, by the B.N.A. Act, subject to the administration and control of the Provincial legislature.\nApart from the fact that such legislation would not be legislation exclusively competent to the Dominion, it would transcend the ambit of Dominion authority touching railways or canals, which was not intended to enable the Dominion to take possession of sources of revenue assigned to the provinces, and by assuming the administration of them, to appropriate to itself a field of jurisdiction belonging exclusively to the provinces. Similar considerations apply to the exploitation and disposition of water-powers appropriated by the Dominion in exercise of its legislative authority in relation to canals. Assuming such an appropriation by the Dominion to be competent without payment of compensation, the Dominion could not constitutionally assume the administration or control of water-powers so acquired for purposes not connected with the canal. We must, as best we can, reconcile the control by the provinces of their own assets as assets, with the exercise by the Dominion of its exclusive powers for the purposes which those powers were intended to subserve. This can only be accomplished by recognizing that the proprietary rights of the provinces may be prejudicially affected, even to the point of rendering them economically valueless, through the exercise by the Dominion of its exclusive and plenary powers of legislation under the enumerated heads of section 91. On the other hand, in giving effect to the provisions of the British North America Act, we must rigorously adhere to the radical distinction between these two classes of enactment: legislation in execution of the Dominion\u2019s legislative powers under section 91, which may, in greater or less degree, according to the circumstances and the nature of the power, affect the proprietary rights of the provinces, and even exclude them from any effective control of their property; and, in contradistinction, legislation conceived with the purpose of intervening in the control and disposition of provincial assets, in a manner, which, under the enactments of that Act touching the distribution of assets, revenues and liabilities, is exclusively competent to the provinces.\nBefore proceeding to an examination of the interrogatories submitted, a few words of comment are required upon a point of more or less general application.\nDuring the argument there was much discussion touching the effect of s. 92 (10c). In the construction and application of that enactment, questions must emerge of far-reaching significance and importance. But such questions do not appear to be presented by the interrogatories before us. True, it cannot admit of much doubt that, as regards many of the kinds of works within the scope of them, the Dominion might acquire legislative jurisdiction by following the procedure prescribed by s. 92 (10c); but the interrogatories, which are expressed in general terms, are naturally read as concerning a jurisdiction given directly by the British North America Act itself, rather than mediately through the instrumentality of declarations by the Parliament of Canada under s. 92 (10c). Questions 2 and 3 illustrate this. At bar, the discussion of this sub-head 92 (10c) was chiefly directed to an investigation of its bearing upon the answer to interrogatory no. 7. But it does not appear that this interrogatory ought to be read as requiring an opinion upon the points discussed.\nThe authority created by s. 92 (10c) is of a most unusual nature. It is an authority given to the Dominion Parliament to clothe itself with jurisdiction\u2014exclusive jurisdiction\u2014in respect of subjects over which, in the absence of such action by Parliament, exclusive control is, and would remain vested in the provinces. Parliament is empowered to withdraw from that control matters coming within such subjects, and to assume jurisdiction itself. It wields an authority which enables it, in effect, to rearrange the distribution of legislative powers effected directly by the Act, and, in some views of the enactment, to bring about changes of the most radical import, in that distribution; and the basis and condition of its action must be the decision by Parliament that the \u201cwork or undertaking\u201d or class of works or undertakings affected by that action is \u201cfor the general advantage of Canada,\u201d or of two or more of the provinces; which decision must be evidenced and authenticated by a solemn declaration, in that sense, by Parliament itself.\nHad the intention been to address to us interrogatories touching the conditions under which this abnormal responsibility may devolve upon Parliament, it seems probable that such intention would have been explicitly manifested.\nThe language of the 7th interrogatory does not suggest an intention to elicit a response concerning a hypothetical jurisdiction, which may never come into existence; but rather concerning the extent and conditions of an existing jurisdiction, arising directly and immediately from the enactments of the Act itself.\nThe 2nd and 3rd questions are broadly expressed. \u201cNavigation purposes\u201d is a sweeping phrase. It has been employed to denote not only regulation and control of ships and shipping, but the control of navigable waters in the interests of shipping, including the improvement of navigability, the execution of works for facilitating navigation, the provision of such aids to navigation as beacons, buoys, and lighthouses; the establishment of harbours and harbour works, such as those considered in the Montreal Harbour case[20], which included an embankment and railway on the shore of the harbour, quays, a dry-dock, and a ship-repairing plant. And it was argued on behalf of the Do minion that \u201cnavigation and shipping\u201d within the intendment of s. 91 (10), would embrace all such matters as those just mentioned, as well as the construction, maintenance and operation of canals and incidental works, and generally all matters relating to transport by water.\nIt is, at least, doubtful whether the exclusive jurisdiction contemplated by item 10, s. 91, extends to many of the matters, which are above indicated as falling within the scope of the phrase \u201cnavigation purposes,\u201d when that phrase is given an interpretation so wide as that which counsel for the Dominion ascribe to it. By the 9th head of the same section, exclusive jurisdiction is entrusted to the Dominion in respect of matters falling within the subjects described by the words \u201cbeacons, buoys and lighthouses,\u201d and, under no. 13 in respect of matters included within the subject \u201cFerries\u201d between a province and other countries or between two provinces. Exclusive jurisdiction with regard to canals, and to other works of like character, extending beyond the limits of a province, is confided to the Dominion under s. 92 (10a); and by sub-heads (a) and (b) of s. 92 (10) the subjects of that exclusive jurisdiction comprise all matters falling within the descriptions \u201cLines of steam or other ships connecting the province with any other or others of the provinces,\u201d and \u201cLines of steamships between the province and any British or foreign country.\u201d Further, there is much to be said for the view that, subject to the power bestowed upon the Dominion by sub-head (c) of s. 92 (10) exclusive authority is committed to the provinces with respect to canals and other similar Works (which, according to the contention of the Dominion, would fall within the tenor of the phrase \u201cnavigation purposes\u201d), when such works are wholly situated within a province. It is not necessary to decide the point, but it is, at all events, quite open to argument that sub-heads (a) and (b) are intended to define exceptions to the principal clause of head 10, s. 92; and that, consequently, \u201cworks and undertakings,\u201d under the principal clause, include works and undertakings of the nature of those specified in these sub-heads so long as they are wholly within the boundaries of a province. If the subjects included under head 10, s. 91, embrace those falling within head 13, as well as \u201cbeacons, buoys, lighthouses\u201d designated in head 9, and \u201cworks and undertakings\u201d connected with \u201cnavigation and shipping\u201d and within the field of sub-heads (a) and (b) of s. 92 (10), then, to borrow the phrase used by Lord Haldane speaking for the Privy Council in John Deere Plow Co. v. Wharton[21], the enactment in no. 13 and the designation of \u201cbeacons, buoys, lighthouses\u201d in item 9 and of the subjects, as well, connected with navigation and shipping in sub-heads (a) and (b) of s. 92 (10) are nugatory; on the other hand, if the principle be applied which has controlled the operation of the second head of s. 91 \u201cRegulation of Trade and Commerce\u201d (Toronto Electric Commissioners v. Snider[22]), and of head 13 of s. 92, \u201cProperty and Civil Rights,\u201d as respects matters connected with the subject (head 11), \u201cIncorporations and Companies\u201d (John Deere Plow Co. v. Wharton[23]), then the matters explicitly dealt with in heads 9 and 13 of s. 91 and 10a and 10b of s. 92, which ordinarily might be embraced within the general language of no. 10 of s. 91, must be treated as outside the scope of that head.\nNevertheless, it has been said that the language of ss. 91 and 92\nand of the various heads which they contain obviously cannot be construed as having been intended to embody the exact disjunctions of a perfect logical scheme. The draftsman had to work on the terms of a political agreement, terms which were mainly to be sought for in the resolutions passed at Quebec in October, 1864. To these resolutions and the sections founded on them, the remark applies which was made by this Board after the Australian Commonwealth Act in a recent case Attorney General for Commonwealth v. Colonial Refining Co.[24], that if there is at points obscurity in language, this may be taken to be due, not to uncertainty as to general principle, but to that difficulty in obtaining ready agreement about phrases which attends the drafting of legislative measures by large assemblages. It may be added that the form in which provisions in terms over-lapping each other have been placed side by side shows that those who passed the Confederation Act intended to leave the working out an interpretation of these provisions to practice and to judicial decision. John Deere Plow Co. v. Wharton[25].\nIt is notorious that for many years, probably ever since the formation of the Union, the Dominion Parliament and Government have assumed, and acted on the assumption, that the authority derived from head no. 10 of s. 91 was sufficient to enable Parliament to legislate, in respect of most, if not all, the classes of matters it is now contended fall within the scope of the phrase \u201cnavigation purposes and in support of that view it may be noticed that the majority of the members of this court took the view in Booth v. Lowery[26], that river improvements, consisting of storage dams and basins, intended to improve the navigability of the river Ottawa and one of its tributaries, were subject to the legislative control of the Dominion under that head. Further, as already observed, the recent pronouncements in the judgments in the Privy Council and this court in the three cases cited above, beginning with the Montreal Harbour case[27], give countenance to the view that the Dominion may have an implied authority incidental or ancillary to its exclusive authority under head 10 of s. 91, to legislate in respect of some of the purposes intended to be described as\u201d navigation purposes \u201cin these two questions; although the judgment in the Montreal Harbour case (2) seems to say that the exercise of this ancillary or incidental authority is, or may be, conditioned upon the payment of compensation.\nThe principle of the decision in Atty. Gen. for Quebec v. Nipissing Central Ry. Co.[28] would apply to the authority given by 92 (10a) in respect to canals extending beyond a province, which must, for reasons similar to those governing the scope of the authority given by the same sub-head in relation to railways, be held to include the power to determine the route of the canal and make effectual provision for the construction and operation of it on the route determined. Such powers are of the essence of the exclusive authority vested in the Dominion in relation to railways and canals. Obviously, therefore, the 2nd and 3rd questions cannot be answered in the negative. Answers in that sense might convey the impression that the authority of the Dominion, in relation to such a purpose as the construction of a canal, would not in any circumstances involve the power to make use of Provincial Crown property without the consent of the province. On the other hand, it is impossible to affirm, in respect of every \u201cnavigation purpose,\u201d within the purport of these questions that the authority in relation thereto, whether derived from s. 92 (10) and s. 91 (29) or from one of the other heads of s. 91\u2014whether within the exclusive sphere of the Dominion Parliament, or only referable to its incidental or ancillary powers\u2014invests the Dominion with the right to override by its legislation the proprietary rights of the provinces.\nThere is no general formula for deciding whether or not, in respect of any such given purpose, the nature of the Dominion authority imports the existence of such a right. That can only be determined after an examination of the nature of the purpose, the character of the power invoked and the character of the means proposed to be employed in order to effectuate the purpose.\nThe word \u201cexpropriate\u201d in the 3rd question, moreover, would seem to include the act of transferring compulsorily to the Dominion itself, or to the others, the absolute beneficial title of the Crown to lands committed to the control of the provincial legislatures. As already explained, that is an authority which the Dominion did not expressly receive under any of the relevant clauses of s. 91.\nQuestion 4. This interrogatory is also general in form. Moreover, the works, which are the subject of it, although indicated by a general phrase, are existing works. The facts affecting each of them are capable of ascertainment. These facts are not before us; yet a categorical answer to the question would involve an expression of opinion as to powers and rights of the provinces in respect of each of them. Such an opinion could, of course, only proceed upon some general legal rule necessarily governing every case to which the interrogatory, as framed, applies. We have nothing before us to show whether in any given case the water-power has been acquired through private treaty from a provincial government, or from a subject, or, if it has been appropriated without the consent of the owner, or under what authority the officials of the Dominion have acted or professed to act, whether, for example, the Dominion has legislated under the authority of s. 91 (10), or under the authority of s. 92 (10a) or, after the necessary declaration, under s. 92 (10c). Nor have we the facts necessary to enable us to judge whether any authority to take the particular water-power in question did, in point of law, exist, in the circumstances in which it was taken; or, if so, whether the conditions of such authority were duly fulfilled.\nQuestion 5. This, once more, is a general question embracing a group of concrete cases in respect of which the facts are capatole of ascertainment. We have before us neither the relevant physical facts nor the character of the authority under which the construction of the particular works involved in the inquiry purported to proceed. For the reasons indicated in discussing the 4th question, it is not practicable to give a general answer to this question.\nQuestion 6. Broadly speaking, the Dominion has under s. 132 full authority to legislate for the execution of obligations imposed upon Canada, or upon a province, in virtue of an Imperial Treaty. But the rights and jurisdiction of the Dominion and of a province, respectively, in relation to water-powers, created or made available by joint works, such as those referred to in this question, could only be determined after disclosure of the facts touching the terms of the Treaty, and the nature of the works, as well as the rights of the Dominion and of the province, in respect of the waters to be affected by the execution of the treaty.\nFor the reasons above stated, the assumption of jurisdiction under s. 92 (10c) is not discussed.\nAs to works constructed either in \u201cprovincial\u201d or in \u201cinter-provincial\u201d rivers, the Dominion would appear to have jurisdiction respecting such works, if, within the meaning of s. 92 (10a) they extend beyond the boundaries of one of the provinces or connect two provinces. It does not seem practicable to lay down any general test for determining the application of s. 92 (10a), other than that furnished by the language of the enactment itself.\nAs to that branch of the interrogatory which relates to the taking of provincial lands and property for \u201cthe purpose of such works,\u201d works being described as \u201cworks wholly for power purposes,\u201d it does not seem possible to give any useful answer. \u201cAcquisition by expropriation\u201d points to the taking absolutely of the property \u201crequired.\u201d Reasons have been adduced suggesting that this is not permissible. And, moreover, it is not practicable, in the absenee of some more specific description of the nature of the purpose, to state whether, \u201cfor the purposes of such works,\u201d assuming the works themselves to be within the control of the Dominion, the proprietary rights of the province may be overborne or, if so, on what conditions, if any.\nQuestion 8. The second branch of this question is too vaguely expressed to permit of any answer not equally vague and indefinite. As to the first branch, it seems unnecessary to say that a province would be exceeding its powers if it attempted to intervene in matters committed exclusively to Dominion control, by attempting, for example, to interfere with the structure or management of a work withdrawn entirely from provincial jurisdiction, such as a work authorized by the Dominion by legislation in execution of its powers under s. 92 (10a). A province is, moreover, bound, of course, in dealing with rivers in respect of which it has powers of control, to observe any regulation validly enacted by the Dominion in relation to navigation works or in exercise of its authority over navigable waters.\nIt would not be a sufficient recognition of the jurisdiction of the Dominion to affirm that, in the circumstances mentioned in the question, a province is entitled to regulate and control the waters of the river so long as navigation is not interfered with. The obligation of the province in such circumstances is much more definite and precise, as has just been stated. The exercise of jurisdiction by a province, in a manner permitted by the terms of the question, might constitute a substantial encroachment upon the exclusive authority of the Dominion.\nAs to question 9, it was not seriously disputed that, under the conditions mentioned, the provinces have the rights which are the subject of the question. This, of course, is on the assumption that there is no conflicting legislation by the Dominion under an over riding power, a power, for example, conferred by the combined operation of section 91 (29) and 92 (10a).\nSufficient has been said to call attention to the difficulty, indeed the impracticability, of giving precise and categorical answers to some of the questions submitted. As regards most of them, the limit of practicability seems to be reached, when the principles to which reference must be made for the determination of particular cases have been indicated. The authority of the Governor in Council to submit these questions under the statute, and the validity of the statute itself are no longer open to question; and it is the duty of the judges of this court to endeavour, to the utmost of their powers, to return to His Excellency answers as precise and as useful as the questions admit of. Nevertheless the Privy Council has recognized, more than once, that, in the exercise of the statutory authority, interrogatories may through inadvertence be presented, to which it is not possible to give accurate or exhaustive answers, or indeed any answers which are not so encumbered by qualifications and reservations as to deprive them of all practical value. In Attorney General for British Columbia v. Attorney General for Canada[29], Lord Haldane said:\nunder this procedure questions may be put of a kind which it is impossible to answer satisfactorily. Not only may the question (sic) of future litigants be prejudiced by the court laying down principles in an abstract form without any reference or relation to actual facts, but it may turn out to be practically impossible to define a principle adequately and safely without previous ascertainment of the exact facts to which it is to be applied.\nAgain in John Deere Plow Co. v. Wharton[30], Lord Haldane, speaking for the Judicial Committee used these words:\nThe structure of ss. 91 and 92, and the degree to which the connotation of the expressions used overlaps, render it, in their Lordships\u2019 opinion, unwise on this or any other occasion to attempt exhaustive definitions of the meaning and scope of these expressions. Such definitions, in the case of language used under the conditions in which a constitution such as that under consideration was framed, must almost certainly miscarry. It is in many cases only by confining decisions to concrete questions which have actually arisen in circumstances the whole of which are before the tribunal that injustice to future suitors can be avoided.\nAnd, in the same judgment, at pp. 341 and 342, speaking with reference to the answers given by the judges of this court to certain questions submitted by the Governor in Council:\nIn the course of the argument their Lordships gave consideration to the opinions delivered in 1913 by the judges of the Supreme Court of Canada in response to certain abstract questions on the extent of the powers which exist under the Confederation Act for the incorporation of companies in Canada. Their Lordships have read with care the opinions delivered by the members of the Supreme Court, and are impressed by the attention and research which the learned judges brought to bear, in the elaborate judgments given, on the difficult task imposed on them. But the task imposed was, in their Lordships\u2019 opinion, an impossible one, owing to the abstract character of the questions put. For the reasons already indicated, it is impracticable to attempt with safety definitions marking out logical disjunctions between the various powers conferred by ss. 91 and 92 and between their various subheads inter se. Lines of demarcation have to be drawn in construing the application of the sections to actual concrete cases, as to each of Which individually the courts have to determine on which side of a particular line the facts place them. But while in some cases it has proved, and may hereafter prove, possible to go further and to lay down a principle of general application, it results from what has been said about the language of the Confederation Act that this cannot be satisfactorily accomplished in the case of general questions such as those referred to.\nIn Attorney General for Ontario v. Attorney General for Canada[31], the Lord Chancellor, Lord Loreburn, pointed out that when such considerations as these come properly into operation, it is permissible for the judges of this court to make any necessary representations to the Governor in Council, by calling attention to them in their answers.\nIt is important, also, since the opinions evoked by such questions, \u201care of course,\u201d as Lord Loreburn states in the same passage, \u201conly advisory, and will have no more effect than opinions of the law officers,\u201d to observe that, when a concrete case is presented for the practical application of the principles discussed, it may be found necessary, under the light derived from a survey of the facts, to modify the statement of such views as are herein expressed.\nSmith J.\u2014I concur with my brother Duff, but I think it may be of advantage to refer to certain circumstances which will indicate more precisely some of the difficulties that stand in the way of giving complete and definite answers to a number of the questions.\nIt is common knowledge that negotiations have been going on for some time between the Government of the Dominion and the Government of the United States in connection with a proposed scheme for improving navigation on the St. Lawrence river so as to provide passage for large vessels of 25 or 30 foot draft from the ocean to the head of the Great Lakes. A Joint International Commission of Canadian and United States engineers was formed to investigate and report on this project, and a report by this Commission has been made, setting out plans for such; improvements. The Canadian members of the Commission were appointed by the Dominion Government, by Order in Council and the Board acted on instructions agreed to by the two governments by an exchange of notes. The part of international waters where large water powers would be involved in carrying out the scheme proposed is the St. Lawrence river where its centre line forms the boundary between the United States and the province of Ontario from the westerly boundary of the province of Quebec on the south shore, westerly some 48 miles to a point beyond the head of the Galop Rapids at Cardinal. In this part of the river there is a succession of rapids, namely, the Galop at Cardinal, the Rapide Plat at Morrisburg, a small rapid at Farran\u2019s Point, and finally, the Long Sault, which is much greater than any of the others, having a drop of about 42 feet. Along the Canadian shore at each of these rapids there is a canal owned by the Dominion Government.\nTwo alternative schemes for providing the deep waterway are set out in the report of the Commission. It is sufficient for my purpose to refer to one of these. It provides for a dam across the whole river, extending from the Cornwall Canal, on the Canadian main shore\u201d, to the head of Barnhart\u2019s Island, which is United States territory, and then from the foot of this island to the United States main shore, by which the water level at this latter point would be raised to nearly the level of the river at the head of the swift water above the Galop Rapids, thus wiping out all the rapids, and making the whole of the river where the series of rapids occurs navigable for large vessels. This would provide a water head at the dam of about 85 feet, and make available there water-power of over 2,000,000 horse-power, by passing the flow of the river through water wheels, instead of allowing it to waste over the dam. Navigation from the level above the dam to the level below would be by a side canal, and locks connecting these two levels.\nThe international negotiations referred to and the questions that arise as to the respective powers and rights of the Dominion and the province of Ontario in reference to these proposed works and the water-power that would be made available by their construction have given rise to this reference. The questions, of course, are not confined to these particular waters, but it is particularly as to these waters that there is immediate need for clearing up the difficult questions that the proposed works give rise to, because the continuance of the negotiations awaits the result of this reference, as has been officially stated. Question 1 (a) is limited to \u201cwhere the bed of a navigable river is vested in the Crown in right of the province,\u201d and it may be noted in passing that a question may be raised as to whether the bed of these rapids is in the province or the Dominion. Under the British North America Act, the canal and canal lands became the property of the Dominion, so that the Dominion became riparian owner of the lands bordering on the stream opposite these rapids for nearly their whole length. It has been held by the Ontario Court of Appeal that the common law presumption that the riparian proprietor owns to the middle of the bed applies in Ontario, and although the Ontario Legislature promptly nullified the effect of that decision by an Act (1 Geo. V, c. 6) declaring that the presumption shall be the other way, as to grants, both before and after the passing of the Act, that Act could not affect the Dominion title, if it had any. It may be, as intimated in later Ontario decisions, that the presumption would not in any case apply to the St. Lawrence river. I am merely pointing out the possibility of the question being raised in a higher court. We have, of course, nothing to do with it here.\nMuch more complicated questions than this, however, arise, and in order to indicate their character it is necessary to look at the geography of the river. It will be sufficient to consider the situation at the Long Sault Rapids. At their head, the river is divided into two channels by Long Sault Island, which is United States territory. Much the larger volume of water passes down the international channel between this island and the Canadian shore, the bulk of it at this point being in Canadian territory. About two miles below the head of the rapids is a Canadian island near the Canadian shore, known as Sheik\u2019s Island, the head of which is nearly opposite the foot of Long Sault Island. Below the foot of Long Sault Island is the head of Barn-hart\u2019s Island, already referred to as United States territory. The main body of water of the Long Sault Rapids coming down the international channel crosses southerly through the channel between the foot of Long Sault Island and the head of Barnhart\u2019s Island, and joins with the waters of the United States South Sault Channel, together comprising about 96 per cent of all the water of the river, which continues in one stream down the channel between Barnhart\u2019s Island and the United States main shore, entirely in United States territory, for nearly four miles to the foot of Barn-hart\u2019s Island, which is about the foot of the rapids, where, as stated, the proposed dam is to be built.\nThe fall in these rapids to the foot of Long Sault Island is some 12\u00bd feet, and the rest of the total fall of about 42 feet, where, as stated, about 96 per cent of all the water runs, is entirely in the United States. Assuming that the province owns the bed at these rapids to the boundary at the middle of the stream, and that the course of the water is about as I have stated it, and that ownership of the bed gives some right of property in the power that may be made available from water running over this sloping bed, it would be a difficult matter to define the respective rights of the province and the Dominion in the water-power, even on an agreed upon statement of the facts. We have here, however, no statement of facts at all in the record in reference to the situation I have outlined, and it would probably have been impossible to get an agreed upon statement of facts in reference to it. There is a treaty with the United States dealing with the apportionment of water-power of international streams, but it may be that the province of Ontario would have to rely entirely on its own right, independently of this treaty, and that its claim to power would be limited to what the province could develop from these waters by its own unaided powers, situated as these rapids are. It is difficult to see how the province could develop any water-power from these rapids solely by virtue of its own rights and powers. To develop power from a rapid, the practical method employed is to transform the flow from down a slope into a perpendicular fall. This may be done by diverting the flow at or above the head of the slope into an artificial channel on the land, which would carry the flow below the foot of the rapids at about the level above the head, and there discharge it through water-wheels to the lower level. The other method would be by a dam at the foot to raise the level at the upper side of the dam to the level above the head of the rapids, thus providing a perpendicular fall from the upper side of the dam to the lower. If the province were to divert a large part of the water of the international channel referred to, it would be obliged to return it in such a way as to permit it to flow into the entirely United States channel to the extent that it flows there naturally; otherwise the United States would have the same cause to complain that Canada has to complain of the Chicago diversion. The water would therefore have to be returned so that nearly all of it would flow through its natural channel between Long Sault Mand and Barnhart\u2019s Island, and could only be brought there by bringing it across the Cornwall Canal. Once diverted into an artificial channel on the Canadian shore, the water could not be returned to the river without crossing the canal till carried below its foot at Cornwall, 12 miles down, which would be a complete and permanent diversion from its natural course through the United States channel. To make any diversion to the Canadian shore at the head would, moreover, require a dam in the natural channel to turn the water from that channel to the artificial one, and such a dam would close the navigation of the natural channel, which is now used daily, in the summer months, for a line of large passenger steamers. To get a head of water opposite the foot of Long Sault Island would require a dam from that island to Sheik\u2019s Island, which would again completely stop navigation, and of course would require co-operation, on the part of the United States and assent of the Dominion Government under the Navigable Waters Protection Act. Sheik\u2019s Island, too, is part of the Indian Reservation, rented and administered by the Dominion Government for the Indians.\nIt would appear, therefore, that water-power from these rapids could only be developed by Ontario with the cooperation of the United States and the Dominion Government, and that whatever right the province might have to power might, at most, be a part of what could be developed from the 12\u00bd foot fall to the foot of Long Sault Island. The four per cent flow in Canadian territory north of Barnhart\u2019s Island would be too small for practical development. There may be a still further limitation to the right of the province as owner of the bed, because the ordinary development of water-power requires the use of not only the bed, but also of the bank. Here the Dominion Government, as stated, is riparian proprietor of the bank opposite these rapids, and as such would have rights that would put in question the rights of the province to develop water-power by virtue of ownership of the bed only. The situation at this point, as I have outlined it, does not, of course, appear in the record. We might, perhaps, take judicial notice of some of the facts, and might gather others from statutory enactments. A glance at a map of the locality, and particularly at the maps annexed to the report referred to, would show the geographical situation and flow of the main body of water in the river, but we would still fall short of such a full knowledge of facts as would be necessary for the basis of a decision. I have gone beyond the record, not to obtain material as a basis for answering the questions, but merely to emphasize what my brother Duff has said as to the impracticability of giving full and definite answers to all the questions that would have general application, regardless of particular circumstances capable of proof but not established or admitted in the record.\nWhat I have said in reference to the Long Sault Rapids would apply in some, but not all, respects to the other rapids. There are probably localities throughout Canada where the situation would be entirely different, so that the difficulty of giving general answers to a number of the questions applicable to every possible variation of facts and circumstances becomes, I think, apparent.\nQuestions referred answered accordingly.\nSolicitor for the Attorney General of Canada: W.

[1925], c. 16, s. 5 (1).\nDame Philom\u00e8ne Valois, widow of the late Paul Lussier, died at Montreal on September 26, 1920, without issue, leaving an estate amounting to $925,825.55. According to the terms of her last will, dated May 8, 1913, she devised that part of her property derived from the estate of her father among the members of the Valois family. As for the residue of her property, estimated at $497,436.79, the testatrix, under clause 15 of her will, directed that it be liquidated by the testamentary executors and the proceeds handed over by them to the respondent de Boucherville, whom she named fiduciary legatee for the purpose of distributing the same as he may deem advisable, \u201cpour \u00eatre par lui seul employ\u00e9s et distribu\u00e9s comme il le jugera opportun en oeuvres de charit\u00e9, en oeuvres pies, au soulagement des souffrances de l\u2019humanit\u00e9, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9ducation de jeunes gens pauvres.\u201d The testatrix also stipulated in the same clause that the fiduciary legatee would be accountable to his own conscience only in the fulfilment of his trust, \u201csans qu\u2019aucune personne puisse lui en demander compte ou explication.\u201d The appellant, a next of kin of the testatrix, brought an action attacking the validity of the residuary legacy made to the respondent de Boucherville as being null, illegal and irregular because it was too vague, uncertain and not susceptible of enforcement, and also because the real legatees were not designated.\nHeld, that since the coming into force of the Civil Code, as well as under the old law anterior to the Code, the law of the province of Quebec has always been that public charitable bequests should not be set aside for want of certainty, provided it is at all possible to carry out the intention of the will.\nHeld, also, that clause 15 of the will was valid and that the disposition therein contained was for charitable purposes within the meaning of article 869 C.C. The terms of the clause: \u201cen oeuvres de charit\u00e9, en oeuvres pies, au soulagement des souffrances de l\u2019humanit\u00e9, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9ducation de jeunes gens pauvres\u201d fell sufficiently within the terms \u201cfins de bienfaisance ou autres fins permises\u201d contained in article 869 C.C., specially if those terms are read in conjunction with the comments of the Commissioners of Codification (4 & 5 Rep., 180) on that article.\nHeld, also, that the disposition in the will, by Which the fiduciary legatee was dispensed with rendering an account of his administration, was not in contravention with the civil law of Quebec, being on the contrary in conformity with articles 831, 840, 916, 921 C.C.\nHeld, further, that the Superior Court had no jurisdiction, under article 50 C.C.P. or any other provision of the law of the province, to supervise the carrying out of the charitable bequest of the testatrix, or to itself proceed to the distribution of the funds.\nThe majority of the court expressed no opinion on the question whether the Attorney General of Quebec had, under s. 5 (1), R.S.Q. 1925, c. 16, or otherwise, a status to intervene in this case in order to protect the interests of the undefined beneficiaries of the charitable disposition of the testatrix, and whether he was under an obligation to do it, similar to that which attaches, under like circumstances, to the office of the Attorney General of England.

Ross (25 Can. S.C.R. 307): It was not held that the word \u201cpoor\u201d was \u201ctoo vague and uncertain to have any meaning attached to it\u201d as contained in the head-note. The majority of the court, in that case, expressly declared that the construction of the provisions of the will \u00e1s to the legacies to \u201cpoor relations\u201d and charities was left \u201copen for future consideration\u201d; and the dissenting judge, Fournier J., stated that the terms \u201cpoor relations\u201d were vague and uncertain not on account of the word \u201cpoor\u201d but owing to the difficulty in ascertaining what \u201crelations\u201d the testator had in mind.\nThe Royal Institution for the advancement of learning v.

APPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], affirming a judgment of the Superior Court (Ph. Demers J.) and dismissing the appellant\u2019s action with costs.\nDame Philom\u00e8ne Valois, widow of the late Paul Lussier, died at Montreal on the 26th of September, 1920, without issue. She left a considerable estate amounting, according to the statement prepared for purposes of succession duties, to the sum of $925,825.55. According to the terms of her will, executed on the 2nd of March, 1898, before Ma\u00eetres Pepin & Hetu, notaries, that part of her property derived from the estate of her father, Simon Valois, is distributed among the members of the Valois family; as for the balance, the testatrix bequeaths the same to the two testamentary executors, the Rev. Kavanagh and the Rev. Duckett, priests, to be expended or employed by them for benevolent work. According to a second will, revoking the previous one, executed on the 23rd day of May, 1904, before Ma\u00eetres Cox & Charbonneau, notaries, the testatrix made a new distribution among members of the Valois family of the property which she received from her father; as for the balance, she ordered that the testamentary executors hand over the proceeds thereof to the Reverends Kavanagh and Duckett, whom she named fiduciary legatees, to be employed by them for charitable work and work of a similar nature. Finally, the testatrix made a third and last will, revoking all the others; it was executed before Ma\u00eetres Brunet and Ogden on the 8th of May, 1913. It contains dispositions identical to that of the other wills in reference to members of the Valois family. The respondents are named testamentary executors, with full power to sell and realize upon the assets and make a distribution thereof. As for the residue of her property, the testatrix, under clause 15 of her will, directs that it be liquidated by the testamentary executors and the proceeds thereof handed over by them to the respondent, J. de Boucherville, whom she names fiduciary legatee, for the purpose of distributing the same as he may deem advisable, for charitable or devotional work, to alleviate the sufferings of humanity and to educate young people in straitened circumstances: \u201cpour\n[Page 237[\n\u00eatre par lui seul employ\u00e9s et distribu\u00e9s comme il le jugera opportun en oeuvres de charit\u00e9, en oeuvres pies, au soulagement des souffrances de l\u2019humanit\u00e9, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9ducation de jeunes gens pauvres.\u201d * * * The value of that part of the estate bequeathed to the Valois family is $415,560, and the portion devolving to the respondent, de Boucherville, as fiduciary legatee, is $497,436,79. The testamentary executors took possession of all the property comprised in the estate, realized upon the same, and turned over the proceeds of the residue thereof to the respondent, de Boucherville, in conformity with clause 15. The appellant is a cousin in the first degree of the testatrix and at the time of the latter\u2019s death, was her next of kin, as she was the only cousin german then living; and, by her action, she attacked the validity of the residuary legacy made to the respondent, de Boucherville, as being null, illegal and irregular because it was too vague, uncertain and not susceptible of enforcement, and also because the real legatees are not designated. The trial judge dismissed the action on the ground that the clause contained an absolute legacy in full ownership in favour of the respondent, de Boucherville. The Court of King\u2019s Bench affirmed this judgment but on different grounds; it held that the legacy was valid according to the terms of article 869 of the Civil Code.\nIn the Supreme Court of Canada, the case was first argued on October 21, 1927; and the Court reserved judgment. On December 16, 1927, the following judgment was rendered by the Court:\u2014\n\u201cAfter consideration the Court is of the opinion that this appeal should not be disposed of without the Attorney General of the province of Quebec being notified of its pendency and of the nature of the questions presented and given an opportunity, if so advised, to intervene.\n\u201cInasmuch as the respondent, while admitting his moral obligation, asserts a right to receive the property in question as a personal bequest and free from any legal obligation, as a trustee or otherwise, to distribute the same amongst the charitable objects of the bounty of the testatrix, it would seem reasonably clear that he cannot adequately represent these prospective beneficiaries.\n\u201cThe validity of the bequest in their favour is contested and an intestacy as to the subject of such bequest is asserted by the appellant as one of the heirs of the testatrix. \u201cHas the Attorney General of Quebec, under the R.S.Q., 1925, c. 16, s. 5 (1), or otherwise, a status to intervene in these proceedings; and has he an obligation to protect the interests of the undefined beneficiaries of the charitable disposition of the testatrix similar to that which attaches, under like circumstances, to the office of the Attorney General of England?\n\u201cHas the Superior Court jurisdiction under article 50 C.C.P., or any other provision of the law of the province of Quebec, to supervise the execution of the charitable bequest of the testatrix, or to compel its being carried out either by holding the respondent accountable to it, or to its officers, or otherwise?\n\u201cIt will be realized that if the foregoing questions are determined in the negative, the testatrix\u2019s charitable purpose may fail; and, if so, the result in law may be either an absolute gift to the respondent, or an intestacy as to the subject of the bequest.\n\u201cSuch are the points to which the Court deems it proper that the attention of the Attorney General of Quebec should be drawn. To permit of his dealing with the matter by intervention, or otherwise, as he may be advised, the Court directs that a copy of this memorandum be transmitted to him, that this appeal shall stand over to be re-argued at the February term and that it be placed for that purpose on the docket for that term at the head of the list of cases from the province of Quebec.\u201d\nOn November 14 and 15, 1928, re-argument took place before the full court, when counsel for the appellant, for the respondent and for the Attorney General of Quebec were heard. On February 5, 1929, the Supreme Court of Canada delivered judgment dismissing the appeal with costs.\nAim\u00e9 Geofirion K.C. for the appellant.\nC. Laurendeau K.C. for the respondents.\nE. Lafleur K.C. and C. Lanctot K.C. for the Attorney General of Quebec.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by Rinfret J.; but Anglin C.J.C. and Mignault and Smith JJ., while concurring with the opinion of Rinfret J., also delivered written judgments. The Chief Justice.\u2014I regard this case as, in some of its aspects, transcending in importance any that has in recent years come before this court from the province of Quebec. That importance is due not chiefly to the fact that the value of the public charitable bequests involved is said to aggregate upwards of $400,000, but rather to the questions raised in respect of which the court deemed it advisable to bring the appeal to the attention of the Attorney General of Quebec, in order to afford him an opportunity, if so advised, to seek to intervene\u2014namely, whether or not he is, as Attorney General, invested with the powers and charged with the duties in regard to such bequests which appertain to the office of Attorney General in England; and to what extent, if at all, the Superior Court of the province of Quebec possesses the right of supervision over the administration of public charitable bequests, which is exercised by the English High Court of Justice as the successor of the former Court of Chancery. Owing to the substantial amount at issue and still more so because of the unimpeachable integrity of the gentleman designated as fiduciary, in whom the testatrix has reposed such unbounded confidence, we thought it opportune to suggest consideration of these matters on the present appeal.\nI have had the advantage of reading the exhaustive opinion prepared by my brother Rinfret, in which I understand my brother Mignault concurs, and I fully accept his conclusion that the impugned bequests are valid and that the respondent takes the property bequeathed to him solely as a fiduciary and in no event as a beneficiary. But for the very explicit language of article 916 C.C., however, which I read as applicable to a testamentary trustee, I am by no means certain that I should not have regarded the extraordinary provisions of the will now before us, which purport to relieve the respondent from all the obligations of accountability and from all subjection to curial control (which to one trained in English law seems incompatible with the existence of a trust), as giving the respondent a possible interest in conflict with his duty and attaching to the bequests \u201cconditions contrary to public order and good morals\u201d within the meaning of article 831 C.C. (8 Pothier\n(Ed. Bug.), p. 288, no. 227; 22 Demolombe, no. 119; 4 Marcada, no. 158; 14 Laurent, 386; Dalloz, 1846, 1, 155), with the result that, while the conditions would fail because invalid, the fiduciary bequests would stand freed from them.\nNotwithstanding the great deference which is due to the considered opinions of my esteemed colleagues from the province of Quebec, I am not wholly convinced that the law of that province is so defective as to provide no adequate means for the supervision of the carrying out of a public charitable bequest such as that now before us. The remedies afforded by arts. 981 (d) and 981 (h) C.C., I regard as quite inadequate. Arts. 981 (1) and 981 (m) are probably inapplicable to cases within art. 916 C.C. The statutory provision now found in s. 5 of the R.S.Q., 1925, c. 16 (notwithstanding the presence in it of the words \u201cin so far as the same are applicable in this province\u201d) I rather think was enacted with a view to conferring upon the Attorney General of Quebec, inter alia, some of the responsibility of the Attorney General of England in regard to such matters. Whether any part of the jurisdiction of the former Court of Chancery in England in regard thereto is vested in the Superior Court of the province of Quebec by article 50, C.C.P., is, no doubt, much more doubtful, as there appears to be no law envisaging the \u201cmanner and form\u201d of its exercise; and no other statutory provision conferring such jurisdiction was cited, nor was any instance of its attempted exercise referred to.\nBut whatever, and however strong, might be my personal views on these subjects, it would, in my opinion, be improper to determine that such functions exist as incidental to the office of the Attorney General for the province of Quebec in view of the doubts of my colleagues; and still more so to assert a jurisdiction in the Superior Court which they deny. In bringing these important questions to the attention of the law officers of the province and in suggesting that they should consider the advisability of legislation to provide clearly for the effectual supervision of the administration of public charitable trusts, and perhaps also of the property of persons non sui juris, we have probably done all that the circumstances of the case at bar now require.\nDuff J. concurred with Rinfret J. Mignatjlt, J.\u2014Je concours enti\u00e8rement dans le jugement de mon coll\u00e8gue, M. le Juge Rinfret, et je n\u2019aurais rien ajout\u00e9 \u00e0 son expos\u00e9 des questions soulev\u00e9es dans le proc\u00e8s, si, accessoirement \u00e0 ces questions, il ne s\u2019\u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de nouveaux probl\u00e8mes qui sont d\u2019un int\u00e9r\u00eat consid\u00e9rable.\nL\u2019esp\u00e8ce m\u00eame que nous avons \u00e0 juger n\u2019offre rien de bien anormal, si ce n\u2019est qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une somme tr\u00e8s \u00e9lev\u00e9e, au del\u00e0 de $400,000, dont les pauvres b\u00e9n\u00e9ficieront si le legs du r\u00e9sidu est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 valable. Cependant, les questions de droit \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre seraient les m\u00eames, et elles m\u00e9riteraient la m\u00eame attention de notre part, si l\u2019enjeu n\u2019\u00e9tait que d\u2019un faible montant, au lieu d\u2019\u00eatre de pr\u00e8s d\u2019un demi-million.\nMadame Valois, la testatrice, n\u2019avait pas d\u2019enfants et laissait une fortune tr\u00e8s consid\u00e9rable. Elle pouvait en disposer \u201csans r\u00e9serve, restriction, ni limitation\u201d (art. 831 C.C.).\u2019 Elle jouissait donc de ce qu\u2019on appelle la libert\u00e9 illimit\u00e9e de tester, et les seules entraves \u00e0 ce droit sont les prohibitions du code et ce que d\u00e9fendent l\u2019ordre public et les bonnes moeurs. Elle a fait des legs particuliers \u00e0 des parents collat\u00e9raux, et elle voulait laisser le r\u00e9sidu de sa succession aux pauvres. C\u2019\u00e9tait son droit.\nElle a donc fait un legs r\u00e9siduaire pour des fins de bienfaisance tel qu\u2019express\u00e9ment autoris\u00e9 par l\u2019art. 869 C.C., c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire par l\u2019entremise d\u2019un l\u00e9gataire fiduciaire ou simple ministre, M. de Boucherville. Mais elle a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 ce dernier une discr\u00e9tion absolue quant \u00e0 la distribution de son legs \u00e0 des pauvres individuels, et en cela elle ne faisait qu\u2019exercer la libert\u00e9 de tester telle que reconnue par le code.\nElle \u00e9tait encore dans les limites de son droit quand elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que son l\u00e9gataire fiduciaire ne devrait compte qu\u2019\u00e0 sa conscience pour l\u2019accomplissement de sa charge, \u201csans qu\u2019aucune personne puisse lui en demander compte ou explication\u201d.\nEn cela, elle ne d\u00e9passait pas les bornes de la libert\u00e9 de tester, car pouvant donner ses biens \u00e0 M. de Boucherville en toute propri\u00e9t\u00e9, elle pouvait le charger d\u2019en distribuer une partie ou m\u00eame la totalit\u00e9 aux pauvres. Aucun de ses h\u00e9ritiers l\u00e9gaux ne peut lui chercher querelle \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Du reste, la dispense de rendre compte est express\u00e9ment autoris\u00e9e par l\u2019article 916 C.C., dont l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation offre certaines difficult\u00e9s. Ce qui para\u00eet clair, cependant, c\u2019est que le testateur peut exempter l\u2019ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire de l\u2019obligation de faire inventaire et de rendre compte, et il peut aussi le constituer l\u00e9gataire de ce qui lui restera en mains apr\u00e8s avoir acquitt\u00e9 les charges et pay\u00e9 les legs mentionn\u00e9s au testament. Entre ces deux alternatives, il y en a une troisi\u00e8me, car l\u2019ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire peut \u00eatre exempt\u00e9 de faire inventaire et de rendre compte, sans qu\u2019il soit l\u00e9gataire du r\u00e9sidu qui demeure en sa possession. Alors, dit l\u2019article, la d\u00e9charge de faire inventaire et de rendre compte n\u2019emporte pas d\u00e9charge \u201cde payer ce qui lui reste en mains\u201d. Pour d\u00e9terminer quel montant \u201clui reste en mains\u201d, il est \u00e9vident que les tribunaux permettront la preuve par tous moyens l\u00e9gaux. La d\u00e9charge de rendre compte dans ce cas ne para\u00eet \u00eatre que de la proc\u00e9dure sp\u00e9ciale de l\u2019action en reddition de compte, avec ses d\u00e9bats de compte et ses sout\u00e8nements. Mais tout de m\u00eame le compte v\u00e9ritable du r\u00e9sidu rest\u00e9 aux mains de l\u2019ex\u00e9cuteur s\u2019\u00e9tablira en justice s\u2019il y a proc\u00e8s. Voil\u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation raisonnable de l\u2019article 916 C.C., et, ajoutons-le, cet article n\u2019a rien d\u2019extraordinaire, ni d\u2019incompatible avec la libert\u00e9 de tester, \u201csans r\u00e9serve, restriction, ni limitation\u201d de l\u2019art. 831 C.C.\nLa question accessoire, mais de tr\u00e8s grande importance, qui s\u2019est soulev\u00e9e devant cette cour est de savoir si le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral a qualit\u00e9 pour surveiller la distribution d\u2019un legs pour des fins de bienfaisance comme celui de Madame Valois, et si la cour sup\u00e9rieure peut, au cas o\u00f9 M. de Boucherville ne ferait pas la distribution ordonn\u00e9e, le forcer de distribuer, ou bien faire la distribution elle-m\u00eame.\nJe ne crois pas que le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral ait ce pouvoir en la province de Qu\u00e9bec. Le statut invoqu\u00e9 (chap. 16 des statuts refondus de Qu\u00e9bec, 1925) ne lui donne les pouvoirs du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral d\u2019Angleterre qu\u2019en tant qu\u2019ils sont applicables en cette province. Or, on ne trouve, ni dans le code civil, ni dans le code, de proc\u00e9dure civile, aucune disposition pr\u00e9voyant une telle intervention du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Mais ce qui est d\u00e9cisif, c\u2019est que le m\u00e9canisme pour une intervention efficace manque. La cour sup\u00e9rieure n\u2019a pas la juridiction des cours de chancellerie en Angleterre. En dehors des cas enumeres o\u00f9 elle exerce la juridiction gracieuse, elle n\u2019a que la juridiction contentieuse, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire elle juge les proc\u00e8s instruits devant elle. Elle pourrait bien destituer un fiduciaire infid\u00e8le, elle ne peut elle-m\u00eame faire la distribution qu\u2019il refuse de faire.\nIl est bien important, cependant, de dire que nous avons ici un fiduciaire qui ne demande pas mieux que de distribuer le r\u00e9sidu suivant les instructions de la testatrice, et qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 emp\u00each\u00e9 de le faire par ce proc\u00e8s. Dans un cas comme celui qui nous occupe, ni le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, ni la cour de chancellerie n\u2019interviendraient en Angleterre.\nCependant, je crois\u2014s\u2019il m\u2019est permis de le dire respectueusement\u2014qu\u2019il serait sage de donner effet \u00e0 la suggestion des codificateurs et de r\u00e9tablir en la province de Qu\u00e9bec quelque chose de semblable \u00e0 l\u2019ancienne juridiction des procureurs du roi, en augmentant au besoin les pouvoirs de la cour sup\u00e9rieure. Le besoin s\u2019en fait sentir beaucoup moins dans un cas comme celui-ci, o\u00f9 nous avons un fiduciaire int\u00e8gre qui ne demande qu\u2019\u00e0 accomplir son devoir, que dans les cas ordinaires o\u00f9 il s\u2019agit de la protection des incapables, ou bien lorsqu\u2019un fiduciaire essaie d\u2019\u00e9chapper \u00e0 ses obligations. Quand il est question de vendre ou d\u2019hypoth\u00e9quer les immeubles d\u2019un incapable, la consultation du conseil de famille est bien souvent une garantie insuffisante, car il est notoire que, contrairement aux articles 251-253 C.C., on appelle fr\u00e9quemment \u00e0 y si\u00e9ger, comme amis, des gens qui ne connaissent m\u00eame pas l\u2019incapable. Et la d\u00e9cision est donn\u00e9e, dans bien des cas, par un fonctionnaire, un d\u00e9put\u00e9 protonotaire, qui peut bien n\u2019\u00eatre pas un avocat, et non pas par un juge. Il est clair que la consultation obligatoire d\u2019un minist\u00e8re public ou d\u2019un procureur du roi serait une garantie autrement s\u00e9rieuse que celle qu\u2019offre maintenant, sans une consultation semblable, le conseil de famille. Le danger serait moins grand si dans tous les cas o\u00f9 il s\u2019agit des droits des incapables, le jugement, apr\u00e8s consultation du conseil de famille, ne pouvait \u00eatre rendu que par un juge.\nJe renverrais donc l\u2019appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nNewcombe J. concurred with Rinfret J. Rinfret, J.\u2014L\u2019appelante attaque l\u2019article quinzi\u00e8me du testament de Dame Philom\u00e8ne Valois, veuve de feu Paul Lussier, re\u00e7u le 8 mai 1913. Cet article se lit comme suit:\nJe veux et ordonne que tous mes autres biens, soit personnels, soit provenant de la succession de feu mon fr\u00e8re, le R\u00e9v\u00e9rend Etienne Avila Valois, pr\u00eatre, ou d\u2019autres sources, soient r\u00e9alis\u00e9s aussit\u00f4t que possible apr\u00e8s mon d\u00e9c\u00e8s par mes ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires, de la mani\u00e8re qu\u2019ils l\u2019entendront, sans le concours d\u2019autres personnes et sans formalit\u00e9 judiciaire, et apr\u00e8s avoir pourvu de la mani\u00e8re qu\u2019ils jugeront convenable pour le paiement des legs aux institutions ci-dessus nomm\u00e9es et aux personnes n\u2019appartenant pas \u00e0 la famille Valois, et pour le paiement des annuit\u00e9s ci-haut mentionn\u00e9es ainsi qu\u2019au paiement de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration ci-apr\u00e8s stipul\u00e9e en faveur de mes ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires, ces derniers devront remettre les produits desdits biens, au moment que tels produits seront disponibles, entre les mains dudit Joseph B. de Boucherville, avocat et conseiller du roi, de la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, que je nomme \u00e0 cette fin mon l\u00e9gataire fiduciaire qui sera d\u00e8s lors saisi des produits de mes tels biens pour \u00eatre par lui seul employ\u00e9s et distribu\u00e9s comme il le jugera opportun en \u0153uvres de charit\u00e9, en \u0153uvres pies, au soulagement des souffrances de l\u2019humanit\u00e9, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9ducation de jeunes gens pauvres, voulant surtout qu\u2019il affecte une somme de cinq mille piastres \u00e0 la fondation d\u2019une bourse perp\u00e9tuelle dont le revenu servira \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9ducation d\u2019un eccl\u00e9siastique pauvre au Coll\u00e8ge Canadien, \u00e0 Rome, dirig\u00e9 par les pr\u00eatres de Saint-Sulpice, suivant le choix de monsieur le Sup\u00e9rieur du S\u00e9minaire de Montr\u00e9al, et aussi qu\u2019il verse entre les mains de la fabrique de la paroisse de la Nativit\u00e9 de la Sainte Vierge d\u2019Hochelaga, une somme de cinq cents dollars dont le revenu sera employ\u00e9 \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuit\u00e9 au soutien des pauvres de ladite paroisse, le partage de ce revenu devant \u00eatre fait par monsieur le cur\u00e9 de la paroisse.\nSi, au moment de mon d\u00e9c\u00e8s, je n\u2019avais pas encore dispos\u00e9 de tous les effets ayant servi \u00e0 l\u2019usage personnel de mon fr\u00e8re ainsi que les objets religieux, ornements sacerdotaux, vases sacr\u00e9s servant \u00e0 ma chapelle, ainsi que les reliques et autres objets pieux ou religieux, je prie mes ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires de remettre sans d\u00e9lai ces choses \u00e0 mon dit l\u00e9gataire fiduciaire qui devra faire don de ces choses \u00e0 des pr\u00eatres pauvres ou \u00e0 des communaut\u00e9s religieuses, suivant son jugement, car ces choses devront \u00eatre donn\u00e9es et non vendues.\nEn outre, je veux que le l\u00e9gataire fiduciaire ci-dessus nomm\u00e9 ne doive compte qu\u2019\u00e0 sa conscience pour l\u2019accomplissement de sa charge, sans qu\u2019aucune personne puisse lui en demander compte ou explication.\nArrivant le d\u00e9c\u00e8s, disparition, refus ou incapacit\u00e9 d\u2019agir de mon dit l\u00e9gataire fiduciaire, je veux et ordonne qu\u2019il se nomme par acte authentique un rempla\u00e7ant, et m\u00eame je recommande \u00e0 mon l\u00e9gataire fiduciaire de nommer \u00e0 l\u2019avance par acte authentique celui qui devra le remplacer, arrivant le cas de sa disparition, et tel rempla\u00e7ant aura tous les pouvoirs que je conf\u00e8re \u00e0 mon l\u00e9gataire fiduciaire ci-dessus nomm\u00e9.\nComme r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration pour telle charge de l\u00e9gataire fiduciaire ledit Joseph B. de Boucherville, mon l\u00e9gataire fiduciaire ci-dessus nomm\u00e9, aura droit \u00e0 une somme de dieux mille dollars ($2,000) qu\u2019il se paiera \u00e0 m\u00eame les montants qu\u2019il aura re\u00e7us de mes ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires.\nLa testatrice a nomm\u00e9 des ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires qui ont r\u00e9alis\u00e9 les biens mentionn\u00e9s dans l\u2019article 15 et ont fait remise du produit \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9, Joseph B. de Boucherville. Il est admis qu\u2019au moment du d\u00e9c\u00e8s de dame Philom\u00e8ne Valois l\u2019appelante \u00e9tait parente de la testatrice \u00e0 un degr\u00e9 successible. L\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat qu\u2019elle pr\u00e9tend invoquer n\u2019est donc pas discutable. Elle all\u00e8gue que le legs r\u00e9siduaire contenu dans l\u2019article 15\nest nul, ill\u00e9gal et irr\u00e9gulier, \u00e9tant trop vague, incertain, et n\u2019\u00e9tant pas susceptible d\u2019ex\u00e9cution forc\u00e9e.\nElle demande, en cons\u00e9quence, que la cour d\u00e9clare que les biens mentionn\u00e9s dans cet article font partie de la succession l\u00e9gale de dame Philom\u00e8ne Valois et que l\u2019intim\u00e9, qui les a re\u00e7us, soit tenu d\u2019en rendre compte \u00e0 cette succession pour qu\u2019ils soient distribu\u00e9s aux h\u00e9ritiers conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la loi.\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a envisag\u00e9 cette partie du testament comme ayant l\u2019effet de constituer l\u2019intim\u00e9 l\u00e9gataire et propri\u00e9taire des biens dont il est dispos\u00e9 dans cette clause; elle jugea que la testatrice avait le droit d\u2019imposer \u00e0 la conscience de l\u2019intim\u00e9 les charges qui y sont mentionn\u00e9es et de stipuler que personne ne pourrait lui demander compte de l\u2019accomplissement de ce fid\u00e9icommis; que la disposition testamentaire dont il s\u2019agit ne violait aucune prohibition contenue dans le code civil et n\u2019\u00e9tait contraire ni \u00e0 l\u2019ordre public, ni aux bonnes m\u0153urs.\nLa Cour du Banc du Roi a unanimement confirm\u00e9 le dispositif de ce jugement, sains admettre que monsieur de Boucherville \u00e9tait un l\u00e9gataire propri\u00e9taire. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019avis que le legs r\u00e9siduaire contenu dans le testament \u00e9tait permis en vertu de l\u2019article 869 C.C.\nLa question est d\u2019importance \u00e0 cause de la port\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des principes de droit qu\u2019elle soul\u00e8ve. Elle l\u2019est \u00e9galement par suite de la valeur des biens en litige qui, au moment de l\u2019enqu\u00eate, s\u2019\u00e9levait \u00e0 la somme de $497,436.79, \u00e0 laquelle viendront s\u2019ajouter les int\u00e9r\u00eats.\nLa disposition fondamentale de la loi de la province de Qu\u00e9bec sur les testaments est contenue dans l\u2019article 831 C.C. qui se lit comme suit:\n831. Tout majeur sain d\u2019esprit et capable d\u2019ali\u00e9ner ses biens peut en disposer librement par testament sans distinction de leur origine ou de leur nature, soit en faveur de son conjoint en mariage, ou de l\u2019un ou de plusieurs de ses enfants, soit de toute autre personne capable d\u2019aoqu\u00e9rir et de poss\u00e9der, sans r\u00e9serve, restriction, ni limitation, sauf les prohibitions, restrictions et autres causes de nullit\u00e9 contenues en ce Code, et les dispositions ou conditions contraires \u00e0 l\u2019ordre public ou aux bonnes m\u0153urs. Cet article prend sa source dans l\u2019Acte de Qu\u00e9bec de 1774 (14 Geo. III, c. 83, s. X) par lequel les entraves maintenues par les anciennes lois civiles fran\u00e7aises furent abolies dans les termes suivants:\nProvided also, that it shall and may be lawful for every person that is owner of any lands, goods or credits, in the said province, and that has a right to alienate the said lands, goods or credits, in his or her lifetime, by deed of sale, gift, or otherwise, to devise or bequeath the same \u00e1t his or her death, by his or her last will and testament; any law, usage or custom here to before or now prevailing in the province, to the contrary hereof in any wise notwithstanding.\nCes dispositions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9es par le parlement du-Bas Canada en 1801 par le statut XLI Geo. III, c. 4.\nIl. est convenu que l\u2019article 831 C.C. accorde la libert\u00e9 illimit\u00e9e de tester (\u201csans r\u00e9serve, restriction ni limitation\u201d), sauf certaines \u201cprohibitions, restrictions et autres causes de nullit\u00e9\u201d. Mais c\u2019est dans le code seulement, dit l\u2019article, qu\u2019il faut trouver ces \u201cprohibitions, restrictions et autres causes de nullit\u00e9\u201d, parmi lesquelles le texte de l\u2019article range imm\u00e9diatement \u201cles dispositions ou conditions contraires \u00e0 l\u2019ordre public ou aux bonnes m\u0153urs\u201d.\nLe code donne effet, suivant des r\u00e8gles qu\u2019il \u00e9tablit, aux\ndispositions \u00e0 cause de mort, soit de tous biens, soit de partie des biens, faites en forme l\u00e9gale par testament ou codicile, et soit en termes d\u2019institution d\u2019h\u00e9ritier, de don, ou de legs, soit en d\u2019autres termes propres \u00e0 exprimer la volont\u00e9 du testateur * * * (art. 840 C.C.).\nLes r\u00e8gles qui concernent les legs et les pr\u00e9somptions de la volont\u00e9 du testateur, ainsi que le sens attribu\u00e9 \u00e0 certains termes, c\u00e8dent devant l\u2019expression formelle ou autrement suffisante de cette volont\u00e9 dans un autre sens et pour avoir un effet diff\u00e9rent. Le testateur peut d\u00e9roger \u00e0 ces r\u00e8gles en tout ce qui n\u2019est pas contraire \u00e0 l\u2019ordre public, aux bonnes m\u0153urs, \u00e0 quelque loi prohibitive ou \u00e9tablissant autrement des nullit\u00e9s applicables, ou aux droits des cr\u00e9anciers et des tiers (art. 872 C.C.).\nL\u2019appelante ne pr\u00e9tend pas que la clause quinzi\u00e8me du testament contient une disposition ou une condition contraire \u00e0 l\u2019ordre public ou aux bonnes m\u0153urs. Il lui faut donc trouver ailleurs dans le code la prohibition, la restriction ou la cause de nullit\u00e9 qui aurait pour effet de mettre \u00e0 n\u00e9ant le legs r\u00e9siduaire qu\u2019elle demande \u00e0 la cour d\u2019annuler. Elle pr\u00e9tend la trouver dans l\u2019article 838 du Code Civil, parce que, suivant elle, les b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires du legs ne sont pas d\u00e9sign\u00e9s et identifi\u00e9s d\u2019une mani\u00e8re suffisante et que la disposition testamentaire dont il s\u2019agit est faite en faveur de personnes ind\u00e9termin\u00e9es, \u00e0 savoir: en \u0153uvres de charit\u00e9, en \u0153uvres pies, au soulagement des souffrances de l\u2019humanit\u00e9, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9ducation de jeunes gens pauvres.\nIl est \u00e0 remarquer qu\u2019elle ne se plaint pas du legs de $5,000\n\u00e0 la fondation d\u2019une bourse perp\u00e9tuelle dont le revenu servira \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9ducation d\u2019un eccl\u00e9siastique pauvre au Coll\u00e8ge Canadien, \u00e0 Rome, dirig\u00e9 par les pr\u00eatres de Saint-Sulpice, suivant le choix de monsieur le Sup\u00e9rieur du S\u00e9minaire de Montr\u00e9al;\nni du legs qui doit \u00eatre vers\u00e9\nentre les mains de la fabrique de la paroisse de la Nativit\u00e9 de la Sainte Vierge d\u2019Hochelaga (d\u2019) une somme de cinq cents dollars dont le revenu sera employ\u00e9 \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuit\u00e9 au soutien des pauvres de ladite paroisse, le partage de ce revenu devant \u00eatre fait par monsieur le cur\u00e9 de la paroisse;\nnon plus que de l\u2019autre legs des\neffets * * * objets religieux, ornements sacerdotaux, vases sacr\u00e9s * * * reliques et autres objets pieux ou religieux\nqui est fait par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire du l\u00e9gataire fiduciaire\n\u00e0 des pr\u00eatres pauvres ou \u00e0 des communaut\u00e9s religieuses, suivant son jugement.\nCes trois derniers legs sont du m\u00eame ordre que le legs r\u00e9siduaire qui est attaqu\u00e9. Nous soulignons le fait que l\u2019appelante n\u2019a pris aucune conclusion \u00e0 leur \u00e9gard, simplement afin d\u2019expliquer pourquoi ils ne seront pas discut\u00e9s dans la suite de ce jugement.\nLes dispositions testamentaires en faveur de personnes ind\u00e9termin\u00e9es ont fait d\u00e9j\u00e0 l\u2019objet de quelques d\u00e9cisions de nos tribunaux. Il convient cependant de nous borner \u00e0 celles qui ont trait aux \u0153uvres de charit\u00e9 et de bienfaisance, puisque ce sont les seules que l\u2019on trouve dans la clause du testament en litige; et il importe donc de reproduire ici l\u2019article du code sur lequel s\u2019est bas\u00e9e la Cour du Banc du Roi:\n869. Un testateur peut \u00e9tablir des l\u00e9gataires seulement fiduciaires ou simples ministres pour des fins de bienfaisance ou autres fins permises et dans les limites voulues par les lois; il peut aussi remettre les biens pour les m\u00eames fins \u00e0 ses ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires, ou y donner effet comme charge impos\u00e9e \u00e0 ses h\u00e9ritiers et l\u00e9gataires.\nLa premi\u00e8re cause en date est probablement celle qui a trait \u00e0 la fondation de l\u2019universit\u00e9 McGill, \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al. Monsieur McGill avait l\u00e9gu\u00e9 \u00e0 des l\u00e9gataires fiduciaires une terre de quarante-six acres pour \u00eatre c\u00e9d\u00e9e \u00e0 The Royal Institution for the advancement of learning, corporation qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas alors en existence, \u00e0 la condition qu\u2019elle \u00e9rigerait, dans les dix ans, une universit\u00e9 dont l\u2019un des coll\u00e8ges porterait le nom de McGill. Ce legs fut reconnu valide par deux jugements: The Royal Institution for the advancement of learning v. Desrivi\u00e8res[2], confirm\u00e9 par la Cour du Banc du Roi (20 novembre 1828) et par le Conseil priv\u00e9 (7 mai 1828); et Desrivi\u00e8res v. Richardson[3].\nLa note plac\u00e9e en t\u00eate du rapport r\u00e9sume suffisamment l\u2019effet de ces d\u00e9cisions sur le point en discussion:\nThe bequest of a sum of money to trustees for the benefit of a corporation not in esse but in apparent expectancy, is not to be considered a lapsed legacy.\nA simular (bequest, to be applied towards defraying the expense to be incurred in the erection and establishment of a university or college upon condition that the same be erected and established within ten years from the testator\u2019s decease, such condition is accomplished if a corporate and political existence be given to such university or college by letters patent, emanating from the Crown, although a building applied to the purposes of such university or college may not have been erected within that period of time.\nVient ensuite la cause de Freligh v. Seymour[4]. Le testateur y l\u00e9guait ses biens \u201cfor ever upon trust\u201d \u00e0 un ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire qui \u00e9tait charg\u00e9 d\u2019en payer les revenus \u00e0 Dame Jane Freligh; et, apr\u00e8s la mort de cette derni\u00e8re,\nto apply the rents and revenues of the said real and personal property to the tuition and advancement or learning in the aforesaid village of Frelighsburg, wherein a Grammar School shall be established * * * and to and for no other use, intent or purpose whatsoever.\nLa cour d\u00e9cida \u201cthat a bequest in trust is valid in Lower Canada,\u201d mais ne se pronon\u00e7a pas sur la validit\u00e9 du legs pour les fins de l\u2019\u00e9cole parce qu\u2019elle fut d\u2019avis que l\u2019\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 pr\u00e9vue par le testament ne s\u2019\u00e9tait pas encore pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e. Monsieur le Juge Caron y exprima l\u2019opinion que \u201cle testament \u00e9tait valable m\u00eame dans cette seconde hypoth\u00e8se\u201d.\nLa fondation de The Fraser Institute \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al donna lieu \u00e0 un autre proc\u00e8s o\u00f9 le jugement fut rendu par le Conseil priv\u00e9 le 26 novembre 1874, Abbott v. Fraser[5]. L\u2019une des objections qu\u2019on faisait au testament \u00e9tait la m\u00eame que celle qu\u2019on avait soulev\u00e9e dans le cas de l\u2019universit\u00e9 McGill. La soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u201cThe Fraser Institute\u201d, \u00e0 qui le legs \u00e9tait fait, n\u2019existait pas \u00e0 la mort du testateur, et l\u2019on en concluait que le legs \u00e9tait caduc. Le Conseil Priv\u00e9 donna son approbation \u00e0 l\u2019opinion exprim\u00e9e, dans la cause de Desrivi\u00e8res v. Richardson[6], par la Cour d\u2019Appel que la m\u00e9thode adopt\u00e9e dans le testament McGill et dans le testament Eraser de l\u00e9guer des biens \u00e0 des l\u00e9gataires fiduciaires pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de futures institutions que les testateurs entendaient fonder \u00e9tait reconnue par la loi de la province de Qu\u00e9bec et que l\u2019article 869 C.C., qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en force lors du testament McGill mais qui l\u2019\u00e9tait lors du testament Fraser, \u201cpermits the appointment of fiduciary legatees for charitable and other lawful purposes\u201d[7]. Le Conseil Priv\u00e9 maintint le testament parce que c\u2019\u00e9tait\na disposition for a lawful purpose within the meaning of article 869 C.C.; while as to the bequest in favour of a corporation to be thereafter formed, there was no restriction against it to be found in the Code.\nSir Montague Smith, qui pronon\u00e7a le jugement de la cour, fit le commentaire suivant, qu\u2019il convient de reproduire d\u00e8s maintenant et auquel nous aurons l\u2019occasion de revenir plus loin:\nIt is evident that the charitable and lawful purposes mentioned in art. 869 C.C. were not meant to be confined to such trusts only as may be created for the benefit of some definite persons. The use of the word \u201cpurposes\u201d indicates that bequests may be made to uses for general and indefinite recipients so long as the purpose be charitable or lawful, and the bequest be within the limits permitted by law.\nEn 1893, dans la cause de Ross v. Ross[8], la Cour du Banc de la Reine de la province de Qu\u00e9bec d\u00e9cida que la disposition testamentaire con\u00e7ue en ces termes:\nI hereby wil and bequeath all my property, assets or means of any kind, to my brother Frank, who will use one-half of them for public protestant charities in Quebec and Carluke, say the Protestant Hospital Home, French Canadian Mission, and amongst poor relatives as he may judge best\n\u00e9tait valide et ne saurait \u00eatre attaqu\u00e9e comme vague et incertaine, comme ne d\u00e9signant pas suffisamment les b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires, ni comme laiss\u00e9e \u00e0 la volont\u00e9 du l\u00e9gataire Frank Ross.\nLe jugement fut unanime. Il fut confirm\u00e9 par la Cour Supr\u00eame[9], et il est important d\u2019\u00e9tudier ce dernier jugement avec soin, parce qu\u2019il est (avec Brosseau v. Dor\u00e9[10], auquel nous aurons \u00e0 r\u00e9f\u00e9rer plus tard) le seul jugement de cette cour sur la question qui nous occupe, et parce que certains jugements rendus post\u00e9rieurement dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec ont annul\u00e9 des testaments, en pr\u00e9tendant suivre la doctrine expos\u00e9e par cette cour dans Ross v. Ross[11].\nRoss \u00e9tait un marchand demeurant \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec. Se trouvant de passage \u00e0 New-York, il fit un testament olographe conforme \u00e0 la loi de la province de Qu\u00e9bec. C\u2019\u00e9tait en 1865, et avant la mise en force du Code civil; mais il est admis que le code n\u2019a pas chang\u00e9 la loi. Nous avons donn\u00e9 le texte du testament en r\u00e9sumant la d\u00e9cision de la Cour du Banc de la Reine. L\u2019action principale attaquait le testament parce qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas conforme aux lois de l\u2019Etat de New-York o\u00f9 il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait. On invoquait la maxime: \u201cLocus regit actum\u201d.\nTrois personnes intervinrent dans la cause:\n1. William Russell Ross, un cousin, qui all\u00e9gua qu\u2019il \u00e9tait parent et pauvre et r\u00e9clama sa part en vertu du testament;\n2. Morrin College, une institution destin\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9ducation sup\u00e9rieure et plus sp\u00e9cialement \u00e0 la pr\u00e9paration des jeunes gens au minist\u00e8re dans l\u2019Eglise presbyt\u00e9rienne du Canada. Les jeunes gens y \u00e9taient re\u00e7us gratuitement, et l\u2019instruction y \u00e9tait gratuite ou \u00e9tait pay\u00e9e au moyen de bourses ou \u201cscholarships\u201d;\n3. Finlay Asylum, une institution pour le soulagement des vieillards invalides, organis\u00e9e sous la direction de l\u2019Eglise anglicane.\nLe l\u00e9gataire Frank Ross contesta les interventions en pr\u00e9tendant\nthat the whole estate and succession was absolutely his own and the bequests in favour of public protestant charities and poor relations were void for vagueness and uncertainty * * * and conferred no right whatever in favour of any charity or relations.\nIl ajouta:\nA testamentary bequest, to be valid, must be the expression of the will of the testator; he cannot make a legacy depend upon the will of a third person, nor can he leave the choice, of the legatee to a third person.\nLa cour \u00e9tait compos\u00e9e de Sir Henry Strong, juge en chef, et des juges Fournier, Taschereau, Sedgewick et King. La majorit\u00e9 de la Cour Supr\u00eame (Sir Henry Strong, juge en chef, Sedgewick et King JJ.) d\u00e9clara le testament valide, quoique fait \u00e0 New-York, parce qu\u2019il \u00e9tait en l\u2019une des formes admises par la loi de la province de Qu\u00e9bec. Monsieur le juge Fournier concourut dans cette partie du jugement, quoique pour des raisons diff\u00e9rentes de celles de la majorit\u00e9. Monsieur le juge Taschereau fut seul d\u2019opinion diff\u00e9rente sur ce point. L\u2019action principale en annulation du testament se trouva donc rejet\u00e9e et le jugement de la Cour du Banc de la Reine sur cette action fut confirm\u00e9.\nQuant aux interventions o\u00f9 Frank Ross, dans sa contestation, soulevait la nullit\u00e9 des legs pour fins de charit\u00e9 ou aux parents pauvres, voici ce que dit Sir Henry Strong, C.J., qui pronon\u00e7a le jugement de la majorit\u00e9:\nThen as to the interventions. As the principal action was to annul the will, and as that action is dismissed, we are not called upon to interpret the legacies to any greater extent than is rendered necessary for the purpose of disposing of the interventions, but to this extent we must, interpret it in order to ascertain if the parties had any right to intervene.\nIl examine ensuite chacune des trois interventions.\nIl consid\u00e8re que celle de William Russell Ross, qui r\u00e9clame une part du legs comme \u00e9tant l\u2019un des \u201cpoor relations\u201d ne peut \u00eatre accueillie. En premier lieu, ce n\u2019est pas un legs absolu. La disposition conf\u00e8re au l\u00e9gataire Frank Ross la facult\u00e9 de choisir parmi les parents pauvres. Le droit de William Russell Ross, m\u00eame s\u2019il appartenait \u00e0 la classe de parents d\u00e9crits dans le testament, serait donc subordonn\u00e9 au choix pr\u00e9alable de Frank Ross. Mais le juge en chef explique que William Russell Ross ne tombe pas dans la cat\u00e9gorie des \u201crelations\u201d et n\u2019est pas un b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire en vertu du testament.\n\u201cPoor relations\u201d (dit-il) must be interpreted as meaning \u201cheirs-at-law\u201d. The word \u201cpoor\u201d is too vague and uncertain to have any meaning attached to it, and must therefore be rejected. The word \u201crelations\u201d, than standing alone, must be restricted to some particular class, for if it were to be construed generally as meaning all relatives it would be impossible ever to carry out the directions of the will. The line must therefore be drawn somewhere, and can only be drawn so as to exclude all except those whom the law, in the case of an intestacy, recognizes as the proper class among whom to divide the property of a deceased person who dies intestate, namely, his heirs.\nWilliam Russell Ross n\u2019\u00e9tant qu\u2019un cousin du testateur, la cour en conclut qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas un h\u00e9ritier et, pour cette raison, rejeta son intervention avec d\u00e9pens.\nIl est vrai que l\u2019on trouve dans le passage que nous venons de citer la phrase:\nThe word \u201cpoor\u201d is too vague and uncertain to have any meaning attached to it, and must therefore be rejected;\nmais, comme on le voit, ce n\u2019est l\u00e0 qu\u2019un obiter dictum qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas du tout n\u00e9cessaire pour les fins du jugement. La ratio decidendi de l\u2019intervention de William Russell Ross, c\u2019est qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas une \u201crelation\u201d envisag\u00e9e par le legs et que, par cons\u00e9quent, il ne peut tirer aucun b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de la disposition, bien que pauvre, parce qu\u2019il ne fait pas partie de la classe b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire. On remarquera, que m\u00eame si l\u2019on attribuait \u00e0 la phrase incidente sur le mot \u201cpoor\u201d une port\u00e9e qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas eue sur la d\u00e9cision, le juge en chef n\u2019a pas d\u00e9clar\u00e9 le legs nul par suite de l\u2019emploi de ce mot \u201cpoor\u201d, qu\u2019il trouvait vague et incertain, mais il l\u2019a tout simplement consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme non \u00e9crit.\nL\u2019intervention du Morrin College fut rejet\u00e9e parce qu\u2019on fut d\u2019avis qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas une institution charitable dans le sens indiqu\u00e9 dans le testament.\nL\u2019intervention de Finlay Asylum fut maintenue.\nEt, en conclusion, le juge en chef ajoute:\nAs I say above, I only interpret the will so far as is necessary for disposing of the interventions. I disclaim any intention of construing its provisions as to these legacies to poor relatives and charities beyond this. I therefore leave open for future consideration, and for a determination in some further action or proceeding if the parties cannot agree, the questions of how far Frank Ross\u2019s powers of selection go; whether he can give to some of the heirs and exclude others, or whether he must give something to all; and I would say the same with reference to the charities.\nCe fut l\u00e0 l\u2019opinion de la majorit\u00e9 de la cour telle qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 exprim\u00e9e par le juge en chef, qui parlait en son nom. Nous ne croyons pas que l\u2019on puisse trouver l\u00e0 la doctrine qu\u2019un legs ordonnant \u00e0 un l\u00e9gataire fiduciaire de distribuer ses biens\nen \u0153uvres de charit\u00e9, en \u0153uvres pies, au soulagement des souffrances de l\u2019humanit\u00e9, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9ducation de jeunes gens pauvres\nest, suivant la loi de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, trop vague et incertain pour \u00eatre valide. Le jugement de Ross v. Ross[12] d\u00e9clare qu\u2019il ne se prononce pas sur cette question. On ne saurait s\u2019autoriser pour cela de l\u2019allusion \u00e0 l\u2019emploi du mot \u201cpoor\u201d faite en passant par Sir Henry Strong et qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire pour la d\u00e9cision de la cause. Nous croyons, au contraire, que le juge en chef a clairement indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019entendait pas poser de principes de ce genre en d\u00e9clarant formellement qu\u2019il se bornait \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du testament en autant qu\u2019il le fallait pour juger les interventions; qu\u2019il r\u00e9pudiait toute intention de se prononcer sur la validit\u00e9 des dispositions en faveur des parents pauvres et des \u0153uvres charitables, et qu\u2019il entendait laisser cette question ouverte \u201cfor future consideration\u201d. C\u2019est dans ce jugement qu\u2019ont concouru messieurs les juges Sedgewick et King.\nM\u00eame la dissidence de Monsieur le Juge Fournier ne porte pas sur l\u2019incertitude du legs \u00e0 raison de l\u2019emploi du mot \u201cpoor\u201d. Il suffit de voir comment il pose la question dans son jugement:\nLe legs aux parents pauvres est aussi nul pour cause d\u2019incertitude. Que doit-on entendre par l\u2019expression \u201cpoor relations\u201d (parents pauvres)? Sont-ce les parente aux degr\u00e9s successibles, ou seulement tous ceux qui pourraient tracer leur descendance d\u2019un anc\u00eatre commun, qui doivent \u00eatre compris dans ce legs? Ces parents pauvres ne sont aucunement d\u00e9sign\u00e9s et ne pourraient \u00eatre reconnus par aucun \u00e9v\u00e9nement indiqu\u00e9 par le testateur; l\u2019expression vague et incertaine dont le testateur s\u2019est servi rend leur identification impossible et doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e.\nComme on le voit, la difficult\u00e9 entrevue par le savant juge ne provenait pas de l\u2019emploi du mot \u201cpoor\u201d mais de l\u2019emploi du mot \u201crelations\u201d. Ce fait est \u00e0 signaler parce que le legs fiduciaire de Madame Valois est pour des fins de charit\u00e9 et de bienfaisance. Nous verrons que la doctrine qui admet la nullit\u00e9 d\u2019une disposition testamentaire pour cause d\u2019incertitude a toujours fait exception en faveur des legs de charit\u00e9 et nous tenons \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer que le jugement de la majorit\u00e9 dans la cause de Ross v. Ross[13], et m\u00eame le dissentiment de Monsieur le Juge Fournier, n\u2019ont pas eu l\u2019effet d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter la loi de la province de Qu\u00e9bec comme s\u2019opposant \u00e0 cette doctrine d\u2019exception en faveur des legs pour des fins de charit\u00e9 ou de bienfaisance. Suivant nous, l\u2019opinion de Monsieur le Juge Fournier est plut\u00f4t \u00e0 l\u2019effet que le legs dans Ross v. Ross13 p\u00e8che par vice d\u2019obscurit\u00e9 en ce qu\u2019il est impossible de discerner \u00e0 quels parents le testateur entendait l\u00e9guer, et non pas \u00e0 cause de l\u2019incertitude de l\u2019expression \u201cpoor\u201d.\nIl reste \u00e0 remarquer que le maintien de l\u2019intervention de Finlay Asylum \u00e9tait au moins une indication que l\u2019opinion de la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour Supr\u00eame \u00e9tait favorable au legs contenu dans le testament pour fins de charit\u00e9.\nLa cause de Dor\u00e9 v. Brosseau[14], qui vient ensuite, nous offre l\u2019exemple d\u2019un arr\u00eat o\u00f9 la Cour du Banc du Roi a reconnu la validit\u00e9 d\u2019un legs exprim\u00e9 dans les termes suivants:\nSi, apr\u00e8s avoir fait instruire mes neveux et ni\u00e8ces comme susdit, il reste un surplus, je veux que ce surplus soit distribu\u00e9 \u00e0 mes fr\u00e8res et s\u0153urs ou neveux et ni\u00e8ces qui auront le plus besoin, \u00e0 la discr\u00e9tion desdits\nl\u00e9gataires fiduciaires. Le testateur Brosseau avait proc\u00e9d\u00e9 ici de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on que le testateur Ross. Il avait nomm\u00e9 des ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires charg\u00e9s de r\u00e9aliser ses biens et de les transmettre ensuite pour fins de distribution \u00e0 des l\u00e9gataires fiduciaires qu\u2019il nommait. La Cour du Banc du Roi ne trouva pas que les mots \u201cqui auront le plus besoin\u201d invalidaient la disposition pour cause d\u2019incertitude. Elle n\u2019accueillit pas, non plus, l\u2019argument que le choix laiss\u00e9 \u00e0 la discr\u00e9tion des fiduciaires \u00e9tait contraire \u00e0 la loi de la province de Qu\u00e9bec. Elle invoqua sur ce point les arr\u00eats de Molsons Bank v. Lionais, o\u00f9 la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure[15], la Cour du Banc de la Reine[16] et la Cour Supr\u00eame[17] s\u2019\u00e9taient accord\u00e9es pour admettre la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 d\u2019une disposition de ce genre. Elle invoqua \u00e9galement la d\u00e9cision du Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans la cause de McGibbon v. Abbott[18], o\u00f9 les lords admirent le m\u00eame principe; et elle s\u2019autorisa \u00e9galement du jugement alors r\u00e9cent de la Cour Supr\u00eame dans la cause de Ross v. Ross[19], dans lequel elle dit que le pouvoir de conf\u00e9rer ce droit d\u2019\u00e9lection aux fiduciaires avait \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu.\nLa Cour Supr\u00eame confirma le jugement de Brosseau v. Dor\u00e9[20] et d\u00e9clara la disposition valide. Monsieur le Juge Girouard, parlant au nom de toute la cour, dit que depuis la d\u00e9cision du Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans la cause de McGibbon v. Abbott[21] la question de savoir si un testateur peut conf\u00e9rer le pouvoir d\u2019\u00e9lire, qui divisait les commentateurs fran\u00e7ais, \u201cn\u2019est plus susceptible m\u00eame d\u2019un doute dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec\u201d. Il ajouta que la jurisprudence de la Cour Supr\u00eame \u00e9tait au m\u00eame effet, comme le prouvait l\u2019arr\u00eat, de Ross v. Ross20. Sur la question d\u2019incertitude, il d\u00e9clara que les mots \u201cqui en auront le plus besoin\u201d constituaient une direction suffisante pour faire la distribution.\nNous trouvons ensuite, en 1907, l\u2019arr\u00eat de la Cour du Banc du Roi re Stevens v. Coleman[22], qui maintient comme valide une disposition con\u00e7ue en ces termes: that all my property real and personal be retained in trust for the maintenance of a manual labor school for girls\net confiait \u00e0 deux personnes\nto act as executors of my will and take charge of all property of all kinds which I may leave for the purposes contained or expressed in my will.\nL\u2019argument d\u2019incertitude qu\u2019on invoquait contre le legs fut \u00e9cart\u00e9 par la Cour du Banc du Roi, qui confirmait en cela la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure.\nLe jugement de la Cour de Revision dans la cause de Latulippe v. La fabrique de l\u2019\u00e9glise m\u00e9thodiste de M\u00e9gantic[23] est bas\u00e9 sur des consid\u00e9rations d\u2019ordre diff\u00e9rent de celles qui ont fait l\u2019objet des arr\u00eats que nous avons \u00e9tudi\u00e9s jusqu\u2019ici.\nLe d\u00e9funt, Louis Turgeon, avait fait un testament olographe par lequel il l\u00e9guait tous ses biens\n\u00e0 la corporation protestante de la ville du Lac M\u00e9gantic \u00e0 la condition que ce soit pour aider \u00e0 la construction d\u2019un h\u00f4pital protestant dans cette ville.\nSes h\u00e9ritiers attaqu\u00e8rent le testament en pr\u00e9tendant que cette disposition \u00e9tait vague et incertaine et ne d\u00e9signait pas suffisamment le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire. Trois corporations protestantes contest\u00e8rent l\u2019action des h\u00e9ritiers: La fabrique de l\u2019\u00e9glise m\u00e9thodiste de la ville de M\u00e9gantic; La fabrique de l\u2019\u00e9glise presbyt\u00e9rienne de la ville de M\u00e9gantic; et La fabrique de l\u2019\u00e9glise anglicane de la ville de M\u00e9gantic, chacune d\u2019elles pr\u00e9tendant \u00eatre la \u201ccorporation protestante\u201d d\u00e9sign\u00e9e dans le testament. Le jugement de la Cour de Revision, prononc\u00e9 par Monsieur le Juge D\u00e9lorimier, dit d\u2019abord qu\u2019il est reconnu et admis que\u201d la corporation protestante de la ville de M\u00e9gantic n\u2019existe pas et n\u2019a jamais exist\u00e9\u201d; puis il ajoute qu\u2019il est impossible de choisir entre les trois corporations protestantes qui r\u00e9clament le legs, parce que la d\u00e9nomination religieuse n\u2019est pas indiqu\u00e9e dans le testament et qu\u2019aucune d\u2019elles \u201cni s\u00e9par\u00e9ment ni collectivement\u201d n\u2019offre les conditions requises pour invoquer le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de la disposition.\nD\u2019apr\u00e8s notre interpr\u00e9tation, ce jugement n\u2019est rien autre chose qu\u2019une application de l\u2019exemple donn\u00e9 par Pothier (\u00e9dition Bugnet, tome 8, n\u00b0 73) d\u2019une disposition testamentaire qui serait nulle par vice d\u2019obscurit\u00e9 \u201clorsqu\u2019on ne peut absolument discerner au profit de qui le testateur a voulu la flaire.\u201d Il dit:\nSi le testateur avait deux amis qui eussent l\u2019un et l\u2019autre le nom de Pierre, avec lesquels il e\u00fbt v\u00e9cu dans la m\u00eame union, et qu\u2019il e\u00fbt l\u00e9gu\u00e9 en ces termes: Je l\u00e8gue une telle chose \u00e0 mon ami Pierre; s\u2019il ne se rencontre aucune circonstance qui puisse faire pr\u00e9sumer qu\u2019il a voulu l\u00e9guer \u00e0 l\u2019un des deux Pierre plut\u00f4t qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019autre, aucun des deux ne pourra prouver que c\u2019est \u00e0 lui que le legs a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait, ce qui est n\u00e9anmoins n\u00e9cessaire pour fonder sa demande, et par cons\u00e9quent, le legs demeurera nul par vice d\u2019obscurit\u00e9.\nIci ni la fabrique de l\u2019\u00e9glise m\u00e9thodiste, ni la fabrique de l\u2019\u00e9glise presbyt\u00e9rienne, ni la fabrique de l\u2019\u00e9glise anglicane de la ville de M\u00e9gantic n\u2019a pu \u00e9tablir de circonstances qui faisaient pr\u00e9sumer que le testateur avait voulu l\u00e9guer \u00e0 l\u2019une plut\u00f4t qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019autre; et, dans l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 o\u00f9 la cour \u00e9tait de discerner celle des fabriques que le testateur avait en vue, la cour fut contrainte de d\u00e9clarer le legs caduc.\nC\u2019est l\u00e0, suivant nous, la v\u00e9ritable raison de cet arr\u00eat. Cela est confirm\u00e9 par les remarques suivantes que nous trouvons \u00e0 la fin du jugement:\nD\u2019ailleurs il est \u00e0 remarquer qu\u2019il existe une diff\u00e9rence notable entre les causes ci-dessus cit\u00e9es (N.B. Le savant juge vient de citer Stevens v. Coleman[24] et Fraser v. Abbott[25]) et la pr\u00e9sente cause, par le fait que. dans toutes ces causes, le l\u00e9gataire fiduciaire y \u00e9tait nomm\u00e9 avec pr\u00e9cision et certitude, et qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait, pour les tribunaux, qu\u2019\u00e0 le remplacer pour donner effet aux volont\u00e9s clairement exprim\u00e9es du testateur. Dans la cause actuelle, le cas est bien diff\u00e9rent, puisque les corporations d\u00e9fenderesses ne sont aucunement mentionn\u00e9es audit testament, ni comme l\u00e9gataires, ni comme fiduciaires, ni comme charg\u00e9es, de l\u2019ex\u00e9cution du testament.\nOn peut donc en conclure que s\u2019ils eussent \u00e9t\u00e9 en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019une nomination de l\u00e9gataires fiduciaires pr\u00e9cise comme dans le cas actuel, et s\u2019ils avaient trouv\u00e9 possible de discerner \u00e0 laquelle des trois corporations protestantes de la ville de M\u00e9gantic le testateur avait entendu l\u00e9guer ses biens, les m\u00eames juges en seraient venus \u00e0 une conclusion diff\u00e9rente.\nNous arrivons maintenant \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat re Cinq-Mars v. Atkinson[26], d\u00e9cid\u00e9 par la Cour du Banc du Roi en 1915. La clause du testament \u00e9tait la suivante:\nJe veux et ordonne qu\u2019au d\u00e9c\u00e8s de ma fille, les biens pr\u00e9sentement donn\u00e9s en usufruit soient distribu\u00e9s en \u0153uvres de charit\u00e9, par mon ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire ci-apr\u00e8s nomm\u00e9, \u00e0 sa discr\u00e9tion.\nLa l\u00e9gataire universelle a intent\u00e9 une action pour faire annuler cette clause comme vague et incertaine. L\u2019ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire a contest\u00e9 Taction et a soutenu la validit\u00e9 de cette disposition.\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure (Monsieur le Juge Fortin) a maintenu la clause comme valide et l\u00e9gale en se basant sur l\u2019article 869 C.C. La Cour de Revision[27] infirma ce jugement et annula la clause du testament, en d\u00e9clarant que l\u2019arr\u00eat de la Cour Supr\u00eame dans Ross v. Ross[28] ne s\u2019appliquait pas, et en paraissant s\u2019appuyer sur l\u2019arr\u00eat de Latulippe v. La fabrique m\u00e9thodiste de M\u00e9gantic[29] que nous venons d\u2019analyser.\nEn Cour du Banc du Roi, nous avons les notes de Monsieur le Juge Lavergne30, qui semble parler au nom de la cour, et de Monsieur le Juge Pelletier. Monsieur le Juge Lavergne s\u2019appuie uniquement sur l\u2019arr\u00eat de Ross v. Ross28, et Monsieur le Juge Pelletier donne surtout pour raison que\nla testatrice laisse \u00e0 la discr\u00e9tion, de son ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire le soin de distribuer les biens en question, en \u0153uvres de charit\u00e9, comme l\u2019ex\u00e9curteur le jugera opportun, \u00e0 sa discr\u00e9tion.\nNous sommes d\u2019accord avec Monsieur le Juge L\u00e9tourneau dans la pr\u00e9sente cause pour dire que l\u2019arr\u00eat de la Cour Supr\u00eame re Ross v. Ross28 n\u2019a pas la port\u00e9e que la Cour du Banc du Roi lui a donn\u00e9e dans Cinq-Mars v. Atkinson30, comme nous avons t\u00e2ch\u00e9 de la d\u00e9montrer par l\u2019analyse que nous en avons faite.\nQuant au motif invoqu\u00e9 par Monsieur le Juge Pelletier, il n\u2019est par opportun de le discuter ici, puisque la clause, en ce qui concerne le l\u00e9gataire fiduciaire de Boucherville, est r\u00e9dig\u00e9e d\u2019une fa\u00e7on diff\u00e9rente de celle qui \u00e9tait contenue dans le testament Atkinson et ne nous para\u00eet enfreindre aucune des prescriptions de la loi, surtout si l\u2019on tient compte de l\u2019article 916 C.C.\nIl reste les deux jugements de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure re Lyman v. The Royal Trust[30] et Hastings v. MacNaugton[31].\nDans la premi\u00e8re cause, il y avait trois legs contest\u00e9s. Le premier avait pour but d\u2019aider \u201c\u00e0 Montreal public library\u201d. Il pourvoyait \u00e0 un fonds de $25,000 dont on devait laisser accumuler le revenu annuel till such time as a sufficient amount has been subscribed and) paid in to responsible trustees to make with the bequest not less than $1,000,000 when the amount of my bequest with all increment may be handed over to the said trustees.\nLe testament ne nommait par les \u201cresponsible trustees\u201d et il n\u2019en existait pas. Le juge dit dans son jugement:\nNo such library exists or is in sight and there is no reasonable certainty that such a library will be established in Montreal within any reasonable time.\nCe cas \u00e9tait bien loin de celui du Fraser Institute, o\u00f9 les fiduciaires \u00e9taient nomm\u00e9s et la corporation destin\u00e9e \u00e0 administrer la biblioth\u00e8que \u00e9tait sur le point d\u2019\u00eatre organis\u00e9e. En r\u00e9alit\u00e9, nous avons ici ce que les lords du Conseil Priv\u00e9 avaient envisag\u00e9 dans cette cause du Fraser Institute (Abbott v. Fraser[32]), lorsqu\u2019ils disent:\nTheir Lordships consider that an impossibility to apply the property in accordance with the will would in this case arise, if the trustees failed, after the lapse of a reasonable time, to obtain a charter or act of incorporation, and that in that event the property would pass to the heirs under the above article.\nL\u2019article en question est l\u2019article 964 C.C. Ici, non seulement il n\u2019y a pas apparence de la possibilit\u00e9 de mettre le legs \u00e0 ex\u00e9cution dans un d\u00e9lai raisonnable; mais il n\u2019y avait pas de fiduciaires \u00e0 qui les ex\u00e9cuteurs pouvaient remettre le legs. Le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure sur ce point a seulement fait l\u2019application du principe pos\u00e9 par le Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans le passage que nous venons de citer.\nLes deux autres legs contenus dans le testament \u00e9taient faits \u00e0 la \u201cTuberculosis League, or similar works\u201d, et \u201cfor missionary purposes\u201d. La \u201cTuberculosis League\u201d avait cess\u00e9 d\u2019exister, et la cour d\u00e9clara le legs caduc Quant aux mots \u201csimilar works\u201d et \u201cfor missionary purposes\u201d, la cour les trouva trop vagues, en s\u2019appuyant sur les arr\u00eats de Ross v. Ross[33], de Latulippe v. La Fabrique de l\u2019Eglise m\u00e9thodiste de M\u00e9gantic[34] et de Cinq-Mars v. Atkinson[35]. Ce que nous avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit de ces trois arr\u00eats nous dispense de revenir l\u00e0-dessus.\nLa clause en litige dans Hastings v. MacNaughton[36] se lisait:\nThe remainder of my estate to go to some derserving charity, the election of which I leave to my executors.\nElle fut rejet\u00e9e du testament comme trop vague. Ce jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu quelques mois apr\u00e8s celui de Lyman[37] et s\u2019appuie sur le m\u00eame raisonnement et vraisemblablement sur les m\u00eames autorit\u00e9s que ce dernier arr\u00eat.\nCela compl\u00e8te notre revue de la jurisprudence de la province de Qu\u00e9bec sur la question qui nous est soumise. Ce qui s\u2019en d\u00e9gage est la tendance marqu\u00e9e d\u2019envisager avec faveur les legs pour fins de bienfaisance et de charit\u00e9 et de donner l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation la plus large possible \u00e0 l\u2019article 869 C.C. D\u00e8s que l\u2019on trouve dans le testament la nomination d\u2019un ministre, qu\u2019il soit l\u00e9gataire fiduciaire, ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire, ou qu\u2019il soit h\u00e9ritier ou l\u00e9gataire tout simplement, \u00e0 qui peuvent \u00eatre remis les biens destin\u00e9s \u00e0 la charit\u00e9 et qui devra les administrer et les distribuer, les jugements se montrent dispos\u00e9s \u00e0 maintenir le legs, m\u00eame lorsque la volont\u00e9 du testateur est exprim\u00e9e dans les termes les plus g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, pourvu qu\u2019aucune ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 ou obscurit\u00e9 n\u2019emp\u00eache de discerner, entre plusieurs b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires possibles, \u00e0 qui la description du b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire peut s\u2019appliquer, et lequel est le v\u00e9ritable destinataire dans l\u2019esprit du testateur.\nUn moment seulement cette tendance a paru s\u2019arr\u00eater, lorsque la Cour du Banc du Roi, dans Atkinson v. Cinq-Mars[38], a cru devoir donner \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de la Cour Supr\u00eame dans la cause de Ross v. Ross[39] une interpr\u00e9tation et une port\u00e9e que\u2014comme nous croyons l\u2019avoir d\u00e9montr\u00e9\u2014elle ne comporte pas. En plus de tout ce que nous en avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit, il est important de faire remarquer que le juge en chef Strong, lorsqu\u2019il a ins\u00e9r\u00e9 dans son jugement, The word \u201cpoor\u201d is too vague and uncertain to have any meaning attached to it and must therefore be rejected\ns\u2019adressait \u00e0 l\u2019expression du testament \u201cpoor relations\u201d. Il s\u2019agissait donc l\u00e0 simplement d\u2019un legs qu\u2019on pourrait appeler, tout au plus, de charit\u00e9 priv\u00e9e. Or, la doctrine a toujours fait la distinction entre une disposition de charit\u00e9 priv\u00e9e et une disposition pour fins de charit\u00e9, ou charit\u00e9 publique. C\u2019est cette derni\u00e8re seulement qui b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie de la faveur d\u2019exception qui l\u2019exclut de la r\u00e8gle rendant invalide les legs incertains ou ind\u00e9termin\u00e9s. Par cons\u00e9quent, m\u00eame en donnant \u00e0 la phrase incidente du juge en chef Strong une port\u00e9e qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas dans le jugement de Ross v. Ross39, cette opinion n\u2019affecterait que les legs de charit\u00e9 priv\u00e9e, et non pas les legs de charit\u00e9 en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, comme l\u2019indique bien d\u2019ailleurs la fa\u00e7on diff\u00e9rente dont le jugement traite l\u2019autre partie de la clause testamentaire en faveur des \u201cpublic protestant charities\u201d.\nDepuis la mise en vigueur du cod\u00e9, de m\u00eame que dans le droit ant\u00e9rieur, la loi de la province de Qu\u00e9bec a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 que les legs pour fins de charit\u00e9 en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral ne peuvent pas \u00eatre mis de c\u00f4t\u00e9 pour cause d\u2019incertitude, pourvu que l\u2019ex\u00e9cution en f\u00fbt possible. Les legs qui permirent la fondation du McGill College et du Fraser Institute, quoique aucune corporation n\u2019exist\u00e2t pour les accepter lors de la mort du testateur, parurent susceptibles d\u2019ex\u00e9cution par suite de la nomination de l\u00e9gataires fiduciaires qu\u2019ils contenaient et furent maintenus par le Conseil Priv\u00e9.\nNous ne saurions mieux d\u00e9finir la situation qu\u2019en empruntant \u00e0 Flaniol, Droit civil, tome 3, n\u00b0 3344, le passage suivant:\n3344. Quand on y r\u00e9fl\u00e9chit, on voit que l\u2019obstacle qui emp\u00eache de r\u00e9aliser d\u2019une mani\u00e8re directe une fondation par testament, ne vient pas d\u2019une prohibition de la loi, puisque cette m\u00eame fondation aurait peut-\u00eatre \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9e avec empressement et encourag\u00e9e par l\u2019administration, si le fondateur avait voulu ou pu l\u2019organiser de son vivant. L\u2019obstacle vient de ce que, le jour de son d\u00e9c\u00e8s, ses biens vont se trouver vacants et sans ma\u00eetre: ils ne seront pas encore la donation d\u2019un \u00e9tablissement qui n\u2019existe pas; ils ne sont \u00e0 personne. D\u00e8s lors un moyen tr\u00e8s simple s\u2019offre non pas d\u2019 \u201c\u00e9luder Ha loi\u201d, comme on 3e dit \u00e0 tort, car la loi ne d\u00e9fend rien ici, mais de tourner la difficult\u00e9: c\u2019est de charger queulqu\u2019un de faire, apr\u00e8s la mort du testateur, ce que celui-ci aurait pu faire de son vivant; cette personne sera, en quelque sorte, le d\u00e9positaire des biens destin\u00e9s \u00e0 la fondation et ele les poss\u00e9dera sous le titre de l\u00e9gataire, tenu d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter certaines charges \u00e0 lui impos\u00e9es par le d\u00e9funt.\nCe que Planiol dit d\u2019une fondation particuli\u00e8re est \u00e9galement vrai des legs pour la charit\u00e9 en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral.\nDisposer de ses biens (dit Demolombe, vol. 22, n\u00b0 81), dans le sens \u00e9lev\u00e9 de ce mot n\u2019est pas seulement les donner, c\u2019est en commander un emploi quelconque reconnu par la loi et qui devra \u00eatre fait apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9c\u00e8s du disposant de eo quod quis, post mortem suam, fieri velit.\nC\u2019est pour cela, avait-il dit ant\u00e9rieurement (vol. XXII, n\u00b0 2), que la loi permet\nla nomination de l\u2019ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire par lequel le testateur se survit pour ainsi dire \u00e0 lui-m\u00eame dans ce mandataire de son choix, qui le repr\u00e9sente, apr\u00e8s son d\u00e9c\u00e8s, pour procurer l\u2019accomplissement de ses derni\u00e8res volont\u00e9s.\nL\u2019ancien droit fran\u00e7ais a toujours admis les legs pour des fins de charit\u00e9 ou de bienfaisance, quoiqu\u2019ils fussent faits \u00e0 des personnes ind\u00e9termin\u00e9es. Furgole, Testaments (vol. 1), \u00e9crit en 1745:\nL\u2019incertitude ne rend pas non plus les dispositions nulles lorsqu\u2019elles sont faites en faveur de l\u2019\u00e9glise, de l\u2019h\u00f4pital, des pauvres, des captifs * * * (p. 418).\nLes dispositions testamentaires, g\u00e9n\u00e9rales ou particuli\u00e8res, en faveur des pauvres sont bonnes et valables, et l\u2019on ne peut point les attaquer sous pr\u00e9texte d\u2019incertitude (24 Co. de Episcopis et Clericis: id quod pauperibus testamenti, vel codicillis relinquitur, non sit incertis personis relictum evanescat) ce qui a lieu quoiqu\u2019un h\u00f4pital n\u2019ait point \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9, ni que l\u2019on n\u2019ait point exprim\u00e9 la qualit\u00e9 des pauvres auxquels les lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9s sont faites, et dans ce cas les lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9s appartiennent aux pauvres du lieu o\u00f9 le testateur avait son domicile, etc. (p. 391).\nEt Ricard, parlant des legs au profit des pauvres dans son Trait\u00e9 des donations, en 1652 (partie I, chapitre III, sect. XIII, n\u00b0 603, dit:\nLes lois ont non seulement autoris\u00e9 les donations et les legs faits \u00e0 leur profit quoique en nom collectif; mais elles les ont m\u00eame d\u00e9clar\u00e9s les plus favorables de toutes les dispositions.\nIl r\u00e9f\u00e8re alors au m\u00eame texte latin que Furgole et il poursuit:\nEt pour \u00e9viter l\u2019inconv\u00e9nient qui proc\u00e8de de l\u2019incertitude des personnes, entre lesquelles la distribution de semblables legs doit \u00eatre faite, il se pratique de la laisser \u00e0 la discr\u00e9tion des ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires, ou des personnes publiques, si le testateur n\u2019en a autrement dispos\u00e9.\n\u201cLegs pieux\u201d et \u201cdestin\u00e9s aux bonnes \u0153uvres\u201d ont \u201cplusieurs pr\u00e9rogatives\u201d et \u201csont toujours valables\u201d, d\u2019apr\u00e8s Ferri\u00e8re, dans son Dictionnaire du Droit, vol. II, page 109 (1749).\nNous n\u2019avons pas d\u2019ailleurs \u00e0 insister sur la d\u00e9monstration de ce principe. Pothier, dans son Trait\u00e9 des donations testamentaires (\u00e9dition Bugnet, vol. 8, p. 251, n\u00b0 93) dit:\nLes legs faits aux pauvres sont aussi valables, quoiqu\u2019ils ne le fussent pas par l\u2019ancien droit, les pauvres \u00e9tant regard\u00e9s comme personnes incertaines; car ce legs part d\u2019un motif plausible qui est le motif de charit\u00e9. Quand Pothier parle de l\u2019ancien droit, il va sans dire qu\u2019il r\u00e9f\u00e8re au droit romain, o\u00f9 les r\u00e8gles \u00e9taient plus rigoureuses.\nToute cette question est r\u00e9sum\u00e9e par Planiol dans son Trait\u00e9 El\u00e9mentaire de Droit Civil (8e \u00e9d., vol. 3) d\u2019une fa\u00e7on que nous pr\u00e9f\u00e9rons reproduire parce qu\u2019elle nous dispensera d\u2019insister davantage:\nDes lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9s faites aux pauvres.\nA.\u2014Aptitude l\u00e9gale des pauvres \u00e0 recevoir des lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9s. 2991. Importance des legs charitables.\u2014Depuis l\u2019av\u00e8nement du christianisme les lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9s au profit des pauvres ont \u00e9t\u00e9 de tout temps tr\u00e8s nombreuses. D\u00e8s le Ve si\u00e8cle, les empereurs Valentinien et Marcien d\u00e9cidaient qu\u2019un legs fait aux pauvres \u00e9tait valable (Code. liv. 1. tit. 3, loi 23) et il est probable que depuis longtemps des lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9s charitables \u00e9taient faites aux \u00e9glises, \u00e0 qui Constantin avait permis d\u2019adresser des legs par une constitution de l\u2019an 321 (Code. liv. 1. tit. 2, loi 1). Au moyen \u00e2ge, un testateur n\u2019aurait pas voulu \u00e9crire ses derni\u00e8res volont\u00e9s sans y ins\u00e9rer quelques legs pieux, destin\u00e9s \u00e0 de bonnes \u0153uvres et au soulagement des pauvres. De nos jours encore rien n\u2019est plus fr\u00e9quent que de voir des lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9s souvent consid\u00e9rables faites aux pauvres par testament.\n2992. Capacit\u00e9 de recevoir reconnue aux pauvres.\u2014Les pauvres sont-ils des personnes incertaines? Le droit romain les consid\u00e9rait certainement comme tels, et s\u2019il a permis de leur faire des legs, c\u2019est en introduisant en leur faveur une v\u00e9ritable exception inspir\u00e9e par l\u2019influence chr\u00e9tienne. Mais, comme on l\u2019a vu plus haut (n\u00b0 2926), la prohibition ancienne de gratifier des personnes incertaines, au sens romain du mot, n\u2019existe plus en droit fran\u00e7ais; il ne subsiste qu\u2019un obstacle de fait tenant \u00e0 l\u2019ind\u00e9termination des b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires. Or, il est permis d\u2019adresser un legs \u00e0 toute une cat\u00e9gorie de personnes, pourvu que cette cat\u00e9gorie soit elle-m\u00eame d\u00e9termin\u00e9e, car le nombre des l\u00e9gataires appel\u00e9s \u00e0 b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier d\u2019une lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9 n\u2019est pas limit\u00e9 par la loi. Il ne Teste donc plus qu\u2019a rechercher si la cat\u00e9gorie des pauvres est suffisamment d\u00e9termin\u00e9e pour recevoir des legs. On ne saurait dire o\u00f9 commence et o\u00f9 finit la pauvret\u00e9; les limites de cette classe sont ind\u00e9cises; les pauvres ne se reconnaissent pas \u00e0 des signes certains, comme le seraient des personnes habitant telle commune ou exer\u00e7ant telle profession.\nN\u00e9anmoins, il n\u2019y a pas lieu de s\u2019embarrasser du d\u00e9faut de d\u00e9termination, et cela pour une double raison.\n1\u00b0. Si la classe des pauvres n\u2019est pas d\u00e9termin\u00e9e par des limites tranch\u00e9es, elle n\u2019en a pas moins une existence r\u00e9elle, et il serait aussi odieux qu\u2019absurde d\u2019emp\u00eacher des lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9s faites aux pauvres parce que la d\u00e9termination des b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires pauvres pourra, dans certains cas, comporter une appr\u00e9ciation de fait par ceux qui seront charg\u00e9s d\u2019employer les fonds. Je dis \u201cdans certains cas\u201d, car pour la grande majorit\u00e9 de ceux qui se pr\u00e9senteront l\u2019\u00e9tat de d\u00e9tresse et de mis\u00e8re sera \u00e9vident.\n2\u00b0. En fait, la classe des pauvres est secourue par la charit\u00e9 tant publique que priv\u00e9e, et puisque des secours lui sont journellement distribu\u00e9s pour des sommes consid\u00e9rables, il est \u00e9videmment permis de contribuer volontairement \u00e0 augmenter ces distributions par des legs. Le droit serait la forme de l\u2019injustice, si ses principes aboutissaient \u00e0 paralyser la charit\u00e9.\n2993. Etat des textes\u2014Du reste, la question n\u2019est pas douteuse, l\u2019aptitude des pauvres \u00e0 recevoir n\u2019a jamais cess\u00e9 depuis le jour o\u00f9 les empereurs romains l\u2019ont reconnue (Pothier, Donations testamentaires, n\u00b0 93), et le Code civil la suppose en r\u00e9glant, dans ses art. 910 et 937, la fa\u00e7on dont doivent \u00eatre accept\u00e9es les lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9s faites \u201caux pauvres d\u2019une commune\". Les auteurs qui \u00e9crivent sur le droit administratif disent couramment que les pauvres forment une \u201cpersonne civile\u201d (Tissier, n\u00b0 125), Formule inutile: je puis l\u00e9guer mon bien \u00e0 six personnes; pourquoi pas \u00e0 cinq cents?\n2994. Interpr\u00e9tation des dispositions vagues.\u2014Les lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9s faites aux pauvres sont donc possibles, \u00e0 une condition, toutefois, c\u2019est que la cat\u00e9gorie de pauvres appel\u00e9e \u00e0 en b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier soit d\u00e9termin\u00e9e. Ordinairement, le disposant a soin de s\u2019expliquer sur ce point. Quand il ne l\u2019a pas fait, on n\u2019annule pas pour cela la lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9 faite aux pauvres d\u2019une mani\u00e8re vague: on cherche, par interpr\u00e9tation du testament, quels sont ceux que le disposant a entendu gratifier; ordinairement, ce sont les pauvres d\u2019une r\u00e9gion d\u00e9termin\u00e9e, par exemple, ceux de sa commune ou de sa paroisse. Les legs faits aux pauvres sans autre d\u00e9termination donnent lieu \u00e0 des difficult\u00e9s d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9solues diff\u00e9remment. Jadis on les attribuait volontiers aux pauvres de la commune o\u00f9 le testateur se trouvait lorsqu\u2019il a test\u00e9 (Avis du Conseil d\u2019Etat, du 12 ao\u00fbt 1834). D\u2019autres pr\u00e9f\u00e8rent le. lieu de son domicile ou de sa r\u00e9sidence (Pothier, Cout. d\u2019Orl\u00e9ans, introd. au tit. XVI, n\u00b0 38; Demolombe, t. XVIII, n\u00b0 812; Laurent, t. XI, n\u00b0 312; Metz., 10 mai 1844). Cela para\u00eet avant tout une question de fait et le juge doit statuer selon les circonstances (Paris, 7 et 20 mai 1885, Gazette des Tribunaux, 24 juin 1885; Douai, 20 nov. 1803, D. 04, 599).\nL\u2019expos\u00e9 que nous venons de faire de la doctrine reconnue par l\u2019ancien droit fran\u00e7ais ant\u00e9rieurement au code de la province de Qu\u00e9bec est utile pour nous aider \u00e0 comprendre le sens de l\u2019article 869 C.C. Le but de cet article est \u00e9videmment de permettre des legs \u00e0 des personnes ind\u00e9termin\u00e9es pour des fins qui ne sont pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9es autrement que par l\u2019indication qu\u2019elles seront affect\u00e9es \u00e0 la charit\u00e9 ou \u00e0 la bienfaisance. C\u2019est d\u00e9j\u00e0 ce qu\u2019avait signal\u00e9 le Conseil Priv\u00e9, dans ce passage de son jugement re Abbott v. Fraser[40], qu\u2019il est opportun de r\u00e9p\u00e9ter ici:\nIt is evident that the charitable and lawful purposes mentioned in art. 869 were not meant to be Confined to such trusts only as may be created for the benefit of some definite persons. The use of the word \u201cpurposes\u201d indicates that bequests may be made to uses for general and indefinite recipients so long as the purpose be charitable or lawful, and the bequest be within the limits permitted by law.\nCela \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 dire qu\u2019il est permis de faire des legs pour fins de bienfaisance ou fins analogues sans identifier les personnes avantag\u00e9es, en en laissant le choix \u00e0 un l\u00e9gataire fiduciaire, et qu\u2019il suffit d\u2019en indiquer la nature et le caract\u00e8re (purpose)\u2014fins de bienfaisance ou de charit\u00e9\u2014 sans en pr\u00e9ciser la description: \u00e9glises, h\u00f4pitaux, hospices, institutions de charit\u00e9, maisons d\u2019\u00e9ducation. S\u2019il n\u2019avait en vue que des b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires\u2014individus ou institutions\u2014qui seraient nomm\u00e9s dans le testament ou des fins de bienfaisanse qui y seraient d\u00e9termin\u00e9es, l\u2019article 869 C.C. serait inutile. Les autres articles du code y pourvoient d\u00e9j\u00e0.\nL\u2019appelante objecte que cette interpr\u00e9tation aurait pour effet de l\u00e9galiser tous les legs incertains, parce que l\u2019article ne mentionne pas seulement les \u201cfins de bienfaisance\u201d mais aussi \u201cles autres fins permises\u201d. Les legs de Madame Valois sont des legs charitables. Ils sont donc couverts par l\u2019expression: \u201cfins de bienfaisance\u201d, qui comprend la charit\u00e9 mais qui nous para\u00eet avoir un sens plus \u00e9tendu. Il n\u2019est donc pas n\u00e9cessaire, en cette cause, de d\u00e9finir la port\u00e9e des mots: \u201cautres fins permises\u201d. Une trop grande g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisation pourrait \u00eatre emp\u00each\u00e9e par l\u2019application de la r\u00e8gle ejusdem generis. Il nous suffit de savoir que l\u2019article s\u2019adresse \u00e0 toutes fins semblables aux \u201cfins de bienfaisance\u201d, qui y sont express\u00e9ment mentionn\u00e9es. Cela nous est rendu bien clair par ce passage du Cinqui\u00e8me Rapport des Codificateurs (p. 189) qui r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019article 869 C.C.:\nL\u2019article 134 bis (c\u2019est le num\u00e9ro qui lui est donn\u00e9 dans le rapport), qui se trouve en son rang parmi les pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents, expose en abr\u00e9g\u00e9 la loi sur les legs pour des objets pieux, de charit\u00e9, ou de bienfaisance; elle n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 chang\u00e9e par la nouvelle l\u00e9gislation sur lies testaments, qui au contraire \u00e9tait de nature \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tendre.\nVoil\u00e0 donc qui est tr\u00e8s explicite. Les Commissaires ont voulu, par cet article, introduire dans le code la loi qui jusque-l\u00e0 r\u00e9gissait les legs pour des objets pieux, de charit\u00e9 ou de bienfaisance. C\u2019est donc l\u2019ancien droit en mati\u00e8re de charit\u00e9, tel que nous venons de l\u2019exposer et qui permettait des legs en faveur de personnes ind\u00e9termin\u00e9es, que l\u2019article 869 C.C. reproduit. Par l\u2019emploi des mots \u201cou autres fins permises\u201d, l\u2019article n\u2019a pas voulu \u00e9tendre \u00e0 toutes les fins l\u2019exemption \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle d\u2019incertitude. Les commissaires pr\u00e9cisent que l\u2019article expose \u201cla loi sur les legs pour objets pieux, de charit\u00e9 ou de bienfaisance\u201d. Cela confirmerait qu\u2019il faut entendre les \u201cautres fins permises\u201d comme signifiant autres fins du m\u00eame genre. Les commissaires euxm\u00eames voulaient pourvoir aux cas des legs pieux, de charit\u00e9 et de bienfaisance. Ils ne mentionnent dans l\u2019article que les fins de bienfaisance; les \u201cautres fins permises\u201d incluraient au moins les legs pieux et de charit\u00e9.\nIls ne s\u2019expliquent pas sur le sens de l\u2019expression \u201cdans les limites voulues par les lois\u201d. Cette expression ne peut cependant \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e comme excluant les legs de bienfaisance \u00e0 des personnes ind\u00e9termin\u00e9es, par application de l\u2019article 838 C.C. Ce serait l\u00e0 enlever \u00e0 l\u2019article 869 C.C. tout son effet qui est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, en mati\u00e8res de bienfaisance et autres du m\u00eame genre, de permettre ces sortes de legs. Cette expression a trait aux restrictions expos\u00e9es dans le code relativement \u00e0 la substitution, \u00e0 la capacit\u00e9 de recevoir par testament, plus particuli\u00e8rement sans doute \u00e0 la capacit\u00e9 des corporations de mainmortes qui, en vertu de l\u2019article 836 C.C.\nne peuvent recevoir par testament que dans la limite des biens qu\u2019ils peuvent poss\u00e9der. On remarquera que l\u2019article 836 C.C. emploie le m\u00eame mot (\u201climite\u201d) que l\u2019article 869 C.C. Que ce soit l\u00e0 ce que les commissaires avaient en vue lorsqu\u2019ils ont propos\u00e9 le texte: \u201cdans les limites voulues par la loi\u201d, nous para\u00eet la chose la plus vraisemblable lorsque l\u2019on songe \u00e0 la pr\u00e9occupation retrac\u00e9e chez les commentateurs du Code Napol\u00e9on et la plupart des auteurs ant\u00e9rieurs de pr\u00e9venir la fraude \u00e0 la loi en emp\u00eachant les corporations de mainmortes de poss\u00e9der par des moyens indirects ou d\u00e9tourn\u00e9s des biens d\u2019une valeur sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 la limite qui leur \u00e9tait impos\u00e9e par les lois.\nNous nous contenterons, sur ce point, de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer \u00e0 Pothier, \u00e9d. Bugnet, vol. 1, page 412, et surtout peut-\u00eatre \u00e0 Laurent, vol. 11, n\u00b0s 317 \u00e0 328.\nApr\u00e8s le passage que nous venons de citer dans le Cinqui\u00e8me Rapport, les commentateurs continuaient:\nIl est \u00e0 remarquer que dans certains cas des dispositions de cette nature, bien que tout \u00e0 fait permises, pourraient se trouver sans effet parce que d\u2019apr\u00e8s les technicalit\u00e9s du testament il ne se trouverait personne d\u2019habile \u00e0 exercer le droit. Il en est de mi\u00eame de beaucoup d\u2019autres int\u00e9r\u00eats l\u00e9gitimes qui apparaissent et qui cependant ne sont pas et ne peuvent \u00eatre prot\u00e9g\u00e9s d\u2019apr\u00e8s notre pratique judiciaire, par exemple, dans le cas de non-n\u00e9s, de mineurs, d\u2019absents. Sous l\u2019ancien droit de hauts fonctionnaires de l\u2019ordre judiciaire repr\u00e9sentaient devant les tribunaux ceux qui ne pouvaient y agir autrement; en ce pays ce fonctionnaire \u00e9tait appel\u00e9 le procureur du roi. Sans vouloir que les cours prennent d\u2019elles-m\u00eames l\u2019initiative pour l\u2019exercice des droits particuliers, sans requ\u00e9rir davantage dans toutes les causes comme autrefois l\u2019intervention et les coruclusions du minist\u00e8re public, ill serait peut-\u00eatre important de r\u00e9tablir \u00e0 cet effet \u00e0 certains \u00e9gards les fonctions de l\u2019ancien procureur du roi, soit en commettant des devoirs de surveillance et d\u2019action \u00e0 une personne pr\u00e9pos\u00e9e expr\u00e8s, ou aux officiers en loi qui ordinairement repr\u00e9sentent la Couronne, soit m\u00eame en chargeant les tribunaux d\u2019ordonner que communication de la cause leur soit faite lorsque la justice le requerra. Sous les lois anglaises la cour de chancellerie et ses membres exercent de tels pouvoirs protecteurs. Les Commissaires ne se sont pas crus autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 recommander dans le code le r\u00e9tablissement d\u2019une organisation qui tient de si pr\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019ordre public, mais ils signalent le sujet \u00e0 l\u2019attention des autorit\u00e9s comp\u00e9tentes. Les dispositions adopt\u00e9es pourraient ensuite \u00eatre intercal\u00e9es dans le code de proc\u00e9dure.\nQue devons-nous d\u00e9duire de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de? A quoi nous conduit ce rapprochement fait par les commissaires entre l\u2019article 869 C.C., qu\u2019ils introduisent dans le code, et la l\u00e9gislation fran\u00e7aise et anglaise sur le m\u00eame sujet?\nLa conclusion irr\u00e9sistible, c\u2019est que, en r\u00e9digeant l\u2019article 869 C.C., ils ont voulu reconna\u00eetre la validit\u00e9 de legs en faveur de personnes ind\u00e9termin\u00e9es et pour des fins de charit\u00e9 ou de bienfaisance d\u2019une fa\u00e7on aussi \u00e9tendue que la chose \u00e9tait permise sous l\u2019ancien droit et qu\u2019elle est admise en Angleterre. Un legs de la nature de celui qui se trouve dans le testament de Madame Valois n\u2019offrait aucune difficult\u00e9 en France, m\u00eame avant l\u2019organisation des bureaux de bienfaisance. De m\u00eame, en Angleterre, on ne songeait jamais \u00e0 mettre un pareil legs de c\u00f4t\u00e9, m\u00eame avant l\u2019adoption des \u201ccharitable trust acts\u201d et des autres lois relatives aux \u201ccharities\u201d.\nEt ce que les commissaires disent dans leur explication, c\u2019est que, par le moyen de l\u2019article 869 C.C., ils entendent permettre ces m\u00eames legs ind\u00e9termin\u00e9s qui \u00e9taient bons et reconnus valides en France et en Angleterre, que dans ces derniers pays un m\u00e9canisme existait, que dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec ce m\u00e9canisme n\u2019existe pas, qu\u2019ils ne le cr\u00e9ent pas dans le code, mais qu\u2019ils signalent \u00e0 l\u2019attention des autorit\u00e9s comp\u00e9tentes l\u2019opportunit\u00e9 de le cr\u00e9er plus tard. Les m\u00eames legs qui seraient valides en France et en Angleterre sont donc valides dans le Qu\u00e9bec par l\u2019article 869 C.C., avec la diff\u00e9rence qu\u2019en France et en Angleterre un m\u00e9canisme de proc\u00e9dure existe, tandis que dans le Qu\u00e9bec ce m\u00e9canisme n\u2019existait pas, au moins lorsque le code a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9. Nous aurons \u00e0 examiner plus loin s\u2019il existe maintenant; mais nous insistons sur le point que la validit\u00e9 de ce genre de legs n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9, dans l\u2019article 869 ou dans la loi du Qu\u00e9bec, subordonn\u00e9e \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ation du m\u00e9canisme.\nA cause de l\u2019existence dans le code fran\u00e7ais actuel des articles 810 et 837, qui sont plut\u00f4t des lois prohibitives, et \u00e0 cause de l\u2019organisation sp\u00e9ciale relativement aux lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9s faites aux pauvres, nous croyons que, pour les fins de notre discussion, il ne peut r\u00e9sulter aucun avantage d\u2019une comparaison avec la doctrine et la jurisprudence modernes en France.\nPar suite de tout ce que nous venons de dire, nous sommes donc d\u2019avis que l\u2019article quinzi\u00e8me du testament de Madame Valois est valide en vertu de l\u2019article 869 du Code civil. Nous croyons que les termes de cette clause\nen \u0153uvres de charit\u00e9, en \u0153uvres pies, au soulagement des souffrances de l\u2019humanit\u00e9, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9ducation de jeunes gens pauvres\ntombent suffisamment dans le cadre du teste de l\u2019article 869 C.C., \u201cfins de bienfaisance ou autres fins permises\u201d, suivant le sens que les commissaires ont eu en vue, d\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019explication qu\u2019ils donnent dans leur Quatri\u00e8me Rapport. Les expressions \u201c\u0153uvres de charit\u00e9\u201d, \u201c\u0153uvres pies\u201d, sont celles-l\u00e0 m\u00eames qui sont employ\u00e9es dans le rapport. \u201cL\u2019\u00e9ducation de jeunes gens pauvres\u201d a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme rentrant dans la cat\u00e9gorie des \u0153uvres de charit\u00e9 ou. de bienfaisance. L\u2019expression \u201csoulagement des souffrances de l\u2019humanit\u00e9\u201d est apparemment plus ind\u00e9finie; mais il faut l\u2019entendre dans le sens g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la disposition. Il est clair que la testatrice avait en vue la charit\u00e9 en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. La r\u00e8gle invariable est que ce genre de legs doit recevoir l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation la plus large et la plus favorable. On l\u2019a vu dans Planiol: toute difficult\u00e9 d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation est consid\u00e9r\u00e9e avant tout comme \u201cune question de fait sur laquelle le juge doit statuer selon les circonstances\u201d. Par tous les moyens possibles, les tribunaux, en pareils cas, cherchent \u00e0 mettre \u00e0 ex\u00e9cution la volont\u00e9 du testateur et n\u2019acceptent l\u2019invalidit\u00e9 ou la caducit\u00e9 du legs que lorsqu\u2019ils y sont contraints par l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 de satisfaire \u00e0 ses conditions.\nIl reste \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 l\u2019objection que le testament n\u2019est pas susceptible d\u2019ex\u00e9cution forc\u00e9e, ou, en d\u2019autres termes, que le l\u00e9gataire fiduciaire ne pourra \u00eatre contraint \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter la volont\u00e9 de la testatrice.\nDans la clause du testament Ross, le l\u00e9gataire fiduciaire \u00e9tait charg\u00e9 de faire la distribution aux \u201cpublic protestant charities * * * as he may judge best\u201d. On fit la m\u00eame objection. Sir Alexandre Lacoste, pronon\u00e7ant le jugement de la Cour du Banc de la Reine[41], n\u2019a vu l\u00e0 aucune difficult\u00e9 d\u2019ordre l\u00e9gal. Cette situation est bien expos\u00e9e par Planiol, Droit Civil, vol. 3, n\u00b0 3021:\n3021. Cas o\u00f9 il y a charge sans obligation envers personne. Jusqu\u2019ici nous avons suppos\u00e9 que la charge appos\u00e9e \u00e0 une lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9 profitait \u00e0 un tiers que l\u2019on pouvait consid\u00e9rer comme cr\u00e9ancier. C\u2019est une condition qui n\u2019est pas toujours r\u00e9alis\u00e9e; il se peut que le donataire ou le l\u00e9gataire tenu de la charge n\u2019ait devant lui personne qui puisse lui en r\u00e9clamer l\u2019ex\u00e9cution. Ceci peut se produire de deux fa\u00e7ons diff\u00e9rentes:\n1\u00b0. Il est possible que le l\u00e9gataire soit charg\u00e9 de faire fonctionner une \u0153uvre qui ne sera pas rev\u00eatue de la personnalit\u00e9 civile et qui ne constituera pas un \u00e9tablissement distinct. Ainsi un legs \u00e0 un \u00e9v\u00each\u00e9, \u00e0 charge d\u2019entretenir un orphelinat, a \u00e9t\u00e9 valid\u00e9 (Amiens, 16 f\u00e9vr. 1893, D. 94, 2, 67, S. 93, 2, 253). L\u2019orphelinat n\u2019\u00e9tait pas reconnu d\u2019utilit\u00e9 publique; c\u2019\u00e9tait une \u0153uvre priv\u00e9e entretenue par l\u2019\u00e9v\u00each\u00e9; il n\u2019y avait donc pas, aux yeux de la loi, une personne b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de la charge. 2\u00b0. Il se peut que la charge dont le l\u00e9gataire est grev\u00e9e ne constitue pas pour lui une obligation proprement dite et juridiquement d\u00e9finie. Le disposant se contente parfois d\u2019exprimer un d\u00e9sir, ou de demander \u00e0 son l\u00e9gataire un simple engagement d\u2019honneur, dont la r\u00e9alisation est laiss\u00e9e \u00e0 sa discr\u00e9tion. Voyez Cass., 7 janv. 1902, D. 1803. 1.302. Il n\u2019y a alors qu\u2019un simple fid\u00e9icommis non obligatoire, qui est possible (Paris, 17 juin 1892, D. 92.2.381), mais dont la loi n\u2019a pas \u00e0 s\u2019occuper.\nDans la premi\u00e8re hypoth\u00e8se, la seule sanction qui puisse forcer le l\u00e9gataire ou le donataire \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter les charges est l\u2019action en r\u00e9solution qui appartient au disposant ou \u00e0 ses repr\u00e9sentants. Dans la seconde hypoth\u00e8se, il n\u2019y a pas de sanction du tout.\nOn se rappelle que les codificateurs ont envisag\u00e9 cette possibilit\u00e9. Dans le passage de leur rapport que nous avons cit\u00e9, ils ont pr\u00e9vu que\ndes dispositions de cette nature, bien que tout \u00e0 fait permises, pourraient se trouver sans effet, parce que, d\u2019apr\u00e8s les technicalit\u00e9s du testament, il ne se trouverait personne d\u2019habile \u00e0 exercer le droit.\nCela ne les emp\u00eache pas de dire que les dispositions de ce genre sont tout \u00e0 fait permises et de maintenir le texte de l\u2019article 869 C.C. qu\u2019ils proposaient, nonobstant la crainte de cette possibilit\u00e9. Il faut en conclure que la loi, telle qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e par la mise en vigueur du code et de l\u2019article 869 C.C., consid\u00e9rerait ce genre de legs comme valide, m\u00eame s\u2019ils devaient rester sans effet.\nDans le testament de Madame Valois, cependant, il semble que cette question ne doive pas nous pr\u00e9occuper, car la testatrice para\u00eet avoir consenti d\u2019avance aux risques de sa disposition testamentaire et avoir accept\u00e9 les cons\u00e9quences qui pourraient en r\u00e9sulter. Nous venons de voir qu\u2019elle pouvait, en vertu de l\u2019article 869 C.C., \u00e9tablir Monsieur Joseph B. de Boucherville l\u00e9gataire seulement fiduciaire pour les fins qui sont mentionn\u00e9es dans la clause 15, vu qu\u2019elles \u00e9taient des fins de charit\u00e9 et de bienfaisance. La testatrice stipule, en outre, que\nles produits de ces biens (seront) par lui seul employ\u00e9s et distribu\u00e9s comme il le jugera opportun,\nmais, bien entendu, dans le cadre que le testament indique. Cette discr\u00e9tion laiss\u00e9e au l\u00e9gataire fiduciaire est admise par la doctrine, reconnue par la jurisprudence et n\u2019est couverte par aucune prohibition, restriction, ou cause de nullit\u00e9 contenues dans le code (831 C.C.). En outre, la testatrice d\u00e9clare express\u00e9ment:\nJe veux que le l\u00e9gataire fiduciaire ci-dessus nomm\u00e9 ne doive compte qu\u2019\u00e0 sa conscience pour l\u2019accomplissement de sa charge, sans qu\u2019aucune personne puisse lui en demander compte ou explication. Il est impossible de dire que cette clause est contraire au Gode civil de Qu\u00e9bec. Les six juges de cette province qui ont entendu cette cause avant nous ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019accord sur ce point, et nous partageons leur opinion. Nous n\u2019y pouvons voir aucune restriction ou cause de nullit\u00e9 pr\u00e9vue par le code; et, au contraire, nous trouvons la justification de cette disposition de la testatrice dans les articles 831, 840, 916 et 921 C.C. Nous avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 reproduit les articles 831 et 840 C.C. Voici le texte des articles 916 et 921 C.C.:\n916. Le testateur peut limiter l\u2019obligation qu\u2019a l\u2019ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire de faire inventaire et de rendre un compte de l\u2019exercice de sa charge, ou m\u00eame l\u2019en dispenser enti\u00e8rement.\nCette d\u00e9charge n\u2019emporte pas celle de payer ce qui lui reste entre les mains, \u00e0 moins que le testateur n\u2019ait voulu lui remettre la disposition des biens sans responsabilit\u00e9, le constituer l\u00e9gataire, ou que les termes du testament ne comportent autrement la d\u00e9charge de payer.\n921. Le testateur peut modifier, restreindre, ou \u00e9tendre les pouvoirs, les obligations et la. saisine de l\u2019ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire et la dur\u00e9e de sa charge. Il peut constituer l\u2019ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire administrateur des biens en tout ou en partie, et m\u00eame lui donner pouvoir de les ali\u00e9ner, avec ou sans l\u2019intervention de l\u2019h\u00e9ritier ou du l\u00e9gataire en la mani\u00e8re et pour les fins par lui \u00e9tablies.\nL\u2019article 916 C.C. ne laisse pas de doute sur le pouvoir de Madame Valois d\u2019effectuer son legs fiduciaire \u00e0 Monsieur de Boucherville en la forme qu\u2019elle a exprim\u00e9e, et l\u2019article 872 C.C. nous dit que\nles r\u00e8gles qui concernent. les legs et les pr\u00e9somptions de la volont\u00e9 du testateur, ainsi que le sens attribu\u00e9 \u00e0 certains termes, c\u00e8dent devant Fexpression formelle ou autrement suffisante de cette volont\u00e9. Apr\u00e8s tout, les tribunaux n\u2019ont pas d\u2019autre chose \u00e0 faire qu\u2019\u00e0 chercher la volont\u00e9 du testateur et \u00e0 lui donner effet, dans les limites impos\u00e9es par la loi.\nIl est possible que, comme cons\u00e9quence de la dispense de faire inventaire et de rendre compte, de la d\u00e9charge de payer, du fait qu\u2019un testateur remet \u201cla disposition des biens sans responsabilit\u00e9\u201d, de la discr\u00e9tion laiss\u00e9e au fiduciaire et de sa soustraction voulue \u00e0 tout contr\u00f4le quelconque, il en r\u00e9sulte que, dans certains cas, la fiducie n\u2019existe que de nom (Mignault, Droit Civil, vol. 5, p. 171). Mais l\u2019on ne peut \u00e9viter d\u2019admettre que ces dispositions et ces d\u00e9charges sont autoris\u00e9es par le code. Apr\u00e8s tout, la loi du Qu\u00e9bec comporte la libert\u00e9 illimit\u00e9e de tester, restreinte seulement par le code. Dans le cas qui nous occupe, les biens qui font l\u2019objet de la disposition contenue dans la clause 15 appartenaient \u00e0 la testatrice. Elle a voulu en disposer comme elle l\u2019a fait. Elle n\u2019a voulu subordonner son l\u00e9gataire fiduciaire \u00e0 aucun contr\u00f4le. Elle s\u2019en est rapport\u00e9e \u00e0 sa discr\u00e9tion et a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait en lui une confiance absolue. S\u2019il ne distribue pas les biens suivant les indications contenues dans la clause 15, il trahira cette confiance; mais, d\u2019apr\u00e8s les termes m\u00eames du testament, \u201cil n\u2019en devra compte qu\u2019\u00e0 sa conscience\u201d. Les tribunaux n\u2019ont pas \u00e0 s\u2019immiscer l\u00e0 dedans. Ils ne doivent pas respecter \u00e0 moiti\u00e9 seulement la volont\u00e9 de la testatrice. Pourvu qu\u2019elle soit l\u00e9gale, ils doivent la respecter dans son int\u00e9grit\u00e9.\nLa clause 15 du testament Valois n\u2019offre vraiment pas une grande diff\u00e9rence avec \u201cl\u2019engagement d\u2019honneur\u201d dont parle Planiol, dans le passage cit\u00e9 plus haut (n\u00b0 3021) ou avec un legs en pleine propri\u00e9t\u00e9, suivant la d\u00e9cision de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure. M\u00eame le paragraphe de la clause qui pourvoit \u00e0 un rempla\u00e7ant et celui qui attribue un salaire au l\u00e9gataire fiduciaire ne faisaient pas n\u00e9cessairement obstacle \u00e0 cette intervention, puisque cette cour, dans la cause de Masson v. Masson[42], a fait reposer la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des biens de la succession Masson sur la t\u00eate de l\u00e9gataires fiduciaires au remplacement de qui le testament pourvoyait et qui \u00e9taient, eux aussi, indemnis\u00e9s pour leurs services. Au cours du jugement rendu en cette cause par Sir Charles Fitzpatrick, on trouve les deux passages suivants exprimant des vues qui ont \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9es par la majorit\u00e9 de la cour:\nOn the other hand, the Quebec law says that a testator may name legatees who shall be merely fiduciary, or simply trustees for charitable or other lawful purposes within the limit prescribed by law, and by taking advantage of that provision it was open to the testator to vest his estate in the appellants, (fiduciary legatees), who are merely heirs for a special purpose, and to charge them, as mere trustees, to administer his property and to employ it, in accordance with his will. And that is what, in my opinion, the testator has done.\n* * *\nThen, after having provided for the appointment of their successors, he proceeds to say in the following paragraph:\n\u201cAuxquels dits fid\u00e9icommissaires, rempla\u00e7ants ou successeurs je donne et l\u00e8gue, \u00e0 titre de fid\u00e9icommis, tous mesdits biens meubles et immeubles, propres, etc., etc.\u201d\nthat is to say, the universality of his estate. By those words, the whole estate of the deceased\u2014the universality in capital and revenue\u2014was vested in the fiduciary legatees, as such, to administer and hold indefinitely, or as long as the law will permit; so that, on the death of the testator, they were seized alone of the property, rights and actions, of the deceased. Mais nous sommes d\u2019accord avec M. le Juge L\u00e9tourneau pour dire que,\ndans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019intention, qui se d\u00e9gage de la clause 15 du testament est * * * exclusivement en faveur de \u201cfins de bienfaisance\u201d et de \u201cfins de charit\u00e9\u201d; la testatrice y a recours l\u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9, plut\u00f4t qu\u2019elle ne songe \u00e0 le favoriser. Elle prend la responsabilit\u00e9 de s\u2019en remettre \u00e0 lui, parce qu\u2019elle est certaine qu\u2019il accomplira la mission qu\u2019elle lui confie.\nNous adoptons donc la position prise par la Cour du Banc du Roi.\nNous rendons ce jugement apr\u00e8s avoir entendu le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la province de Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 qui la cour, \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une premi\u00e8re audition de la cause, avait fait parvenir le m\u00e9moire suivant:\nAfter consideration the court is of the opinion that this appeal should not be disposed of without the Attorney General of the Province of Quebec being notified of its pendency and of the nature of the questions presented and given an opportunity, if so advised, to intervene.\nInasmuch as the respondent, while admitting his moral obligation, asserts a right to receive the property in question as a personal bequest and free from any legal obligations, as a trustee or otherwise, to distribute the same among the charitable objects of the bounty of the testatrix, it would seem reasonably clear that he cannot adequately represent those prospective beneficiaries.\nThe validity of the bequest in their favour is contested and an intestacy as to the subject of such bequest is asserted by the appellant as one of the heirs of the testatrix.\nHas the Attorney General of Quebec, under E.S.Q., 1925, c. 16, s. 5 (1), or otherwise, a status to intervene in these proceedings; and has he an obligation to protect the interests of the undefined beneficiaries of the charitable disposition of the testatrix similar to that which attaches, under like circumstances, to the office of the Attorney General of England?\nHas the Superior Court jurisdiction under Article 50 C.C.P., or any other provision of the law of the province of Quebec, to supervise the execution of the charitable bequest of the testatrix, or to compel its being carried out either by holding the respondent accountable to it, or to its officers, or otherwise?\nIt will be realized that if the foregoing questions are determined in the negative, the testatrix\u2019s charitable purpose may fail; and, if so, the result in law may be either an absolute gift to the respondent, or an intestacy as to the subject of the bequest.\nSuch are the points to which the Court deems it proper that the attention of the Attorney General of Quebec should be drawn. To permit of his dealing with the matter by intervention, or otherwise, as he may be advised, the court directs that a copy of this memorandum be transmitted to him, that this appeal shall stand over to be re-argued at the February term and that it be placed for that purpose on the docket for that term at the head of the list of cases from the province of Quebec.\nA la suite de cet avis, le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 intervenir et a soutenu devant nous la validit\u00e9 du legs qui faisait l\u2019objet du litige. Sur ce dernier point, notre jugement est donc conforme aux vues qu\u2019il a exprim\u00e9es. Voici maintenant les autres conclusions qu\u2019il a prises dans son intervention:\n(1) That he may be permitted to intervene in this cause in order to exercise the prerogative right of the Crown to seek the enforcement of the charitable trust contained in the said will;\n(2) That the trustee be ordered within a delay to be fixed by the court to complete the distribution of the moneys entrusted to him by the testatrix for the said charitable purpose;\n(3) That in default of the trustee making such distribution within such delay the said trustee be removed and replaced by the court, or such other appropriate remedy may be applied as to this honourable court may seem fit.\nL\u2019appelante a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la question de l\u2019intervention du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral ne l\u2019int\u00e9ressait pas. Si la clause du testament \u00e9tait annul\u00e9e, il n\u2019y avait pas lieu \u00e0 cette intervention. Si, au contraire, la clause \u00e9tait d\u00e9clar\u00e9e valide, elle cessait personnellement d\u2019avoir aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat dans la fa\u00e7on dont les biens seraient distribu\u00e9s.\nLe l\u00e9gataire fiduciaire a pris la position que l\u2019intervention du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral serait au moins pr\u00e9matur\u00e9e, et il a vers\u00e9 au dossier la d\u00e9claration suivante:\nIf the Attorney General has a right of supervision and control, that right cannot be exercised by way of intervention before this Honourable Court nor at this time. At the present moment the legatee is no way in fault and all the defendants have scrupulously fulfilled all the obligations imposed by the said will, and if the moneys donated to charity have not been distributed it is because the ownership of these moneys has been challenged.\nThe legatee avers that he never for one moment thought of appropriating to his own use the moneys which he is charged to distribute, and that he always recognized the obligation he was under of making the distribution in the manner indicated. If the defendants in answer to the plaintiff\u2019s action did, among other grounds, plead that the will creates a legacy with a moral obligation only to the legatee, they did so because to the best of their belief it was the true construction to put upon the will. It is a pure question of law. The legatee, as representing those to whom the moneys will be ultimately distributed, considered to be his duty to put his views or their views before the courts.\nThe legatee sincerely declares that it is indifferent to him whether or not the Attorney General has in this matter a right of supervision or control. Even if the Attorney General has no such right, the legatee invites the Attorney General to come as often as he may deem fit and look over and examine all the books, receipts and all other documents relating to the said estate, and to the distribution of the moneys. And the same invitation is made to all those who may desire to do so. The legatee will be anxious to show how that distribution to charity will be made.\nThe legatee has already made a similar offer to the plaintiff in his plea and hereby renews that offer.\nCette d\u00e9claration donne \u00e0 l\u2019affaire un aspect qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas au moment o\u00f9 la cour a cru devoir informer le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du litige pendant devant elle. On peut voir que les seules conclusions expresses du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral ont \u00e9t\u00e9, en dehors de l\u2019affirmation de son droit d\u2019intervention, de demander \u00e0 la cour de fixer un d\u00e9lai pour l\u2019emploi des deniers de la testatrice aux fins de charit\u00e9 et de bienfaisance, et d\u2019ordonner qu\u2019\u00e0 d\u00e9faut par le fiduciaire d\u2019avoir compl\u00e9t\u00e9 sa distribution dans ce d\u00e9lai, il soit destitu\u00e9 et remplac\u00e9 par la cour.\nA l\u2019audition, Monsieur Lafleur, qui repr\u00e9sentait le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, n\u2019a pas pris de conclusions additionnelles. Il a admis formellement que la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure de la province de Qu\u00e9bec n\u2019avait pas le pouvoir de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer et qu\u2019il ne trouvait rien dans les lois de cette province qui donn\u00e2t aux tribunaux le droit de proc\u00e9der eux-m\u00eames \u00e0 faire la distribution des deniers pr\u00e9vue par le testament. Il a avou\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019existait aucun m\u00e9canisme semblable \u00e0 celui qui fonctionne en France et en Angleterre, et que, depuis le quatri\u00e8me rapport des commissaires, aucune l\u00e9gislation n\u2019avait \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e pour introduire un m\u00e9canisme de ce genre dans la province.\nNous croyons sur ce point devoir accepter les vues du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral; et d\u2019ailleurs nous ne trouvons rien dans les lois de la province de Qu\u00e9bec qui nous permette d\u2019adopter un point de vue diff\u00e9rent. L\u2019article 50 C.P., qui donne \u00e0 la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et \u00e0 ses juges un droit de surveillance et de r\u00e9forme sur les autres tribunaux, personnes, corps politiques et corporations dans la province, \u00e0 l\u2019exception de la Cour du Banc du Roi, est limit\u00e9 par la prescription que ce pouvoir de contr\u00f4le doit s\u2019exercer \u201cen la mani\u00e8re et la forme que prescrit la loi\u201d. La loi ne pr\u00e9voit nulle part une mani\u00e8re ou une forme qui permette \u00e0 la cour de proceder \u00e0 une distribution de deniers en vertu d\u2019un testament. D\u00e9j\u00e0 ce fut l\u2019opinion exprim\u00e9e par Monsieur le Juge Fournier dans la cause de Ross v. Ross[43] et par la Cour du Banc du Roi dans la cause de Cinq-Mars v. Atkinson[44]. Mais, dans l\u2019\u00e9tat actuel de la l\u00e9gislation, le contr\u00f4le des tribunaux se borne au pouvoir de destitution et de remplacement pr\u00e9vu par les articles 917, 924, 981 (c) et 981 (d) C.C., nous pensons, comme l\u2019intim\u00e9, qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas \u00e0 propos d\u00e8s maintenant que cette cour donne des ordres \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Pour la justifier d\u2019agir dans ce sens, il faudrait qu\u2019il f\u00fbt d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que le l\u00e9gataire fiduciaire a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 l\u2019application de ces articles. Ce n\u2019est pas \u00e0 ce sujet que le litige s\u2019est engag\u00e9; et il n\u2019est nullement question de cela dans cette cause o\u00f9 le moindre soup\u00e7on n\u2019est pas m\u00eame soulev\u00e9 contre l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du l\u00e9gataire fiduciaire. Ce n\u2019est pas ici, mais devant la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, et \u00e0 la suite d\u2019all\u00e9gations formelles suivies d\u2019enqu\u00eate \u00e9tablissant des faits qui le justifieraient, qu\u2019un ordre tel que celui qui est demand\u00e9 par le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral pourrait \u00e9maner.\nNous ob\u00e9irons davantage \u00e0 la volont\u00e9 de la testatrice en laissant le l\u00e9gataire fiduciaire proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution du testament librement et sans entraves et en r\u00e9servant \u00e0 ceux \u00e0 qui il appartient le droit de se plaindre r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement devant les tribunaux s\u2019il ne remplit pas la charge qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 confi\u00e9e par la testatrice, comme il le promet et comme il le doit. Tout ordre imm\u00e9diat de la nature de celui qu\u2019on nous demande serait certainement pr\u00e9matur\u00e9.\nIl ne reste donc plus dans l\u2019intervention que la question de savoir si, comme elle le pr\u00e9tend, la Couronne a ici des pr\u00e9rogatives qui autoriseraient le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u00e0 intervenir.\nCette question soul\u00e8ve des points de la plus haute importance et il faudrait l\u2019envisager tant au point de vue des droits de la Couronne que des pouvoirs du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral; sans compter, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, qu\u2019il faudrait tenir compte de la discr\u00e9tion absolue que la testatrice a conf\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 son l\u00e9gataire fiduciaire. Comme nous venons de conclure que cette intervention ne saurait pour le moment apporter aucun avantage efficace, il n\u2019y a aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 aborder et \u00e0 discuter ici le droit d\u2019intervention de la Couronne. C\u2019est une r\u00e8gle sage qui veut que les tribunaux se bornent \u00e0 trancher les points de droit qui sont n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 la solution des litiges qui leur sont soumis.\nDans cette cause, il s\u2019agissait de savoir si le legs fiduciaire \u00e9tait valide, et nous avons donn\u00e9 notre solution \u00e0 cette question.\nComme cons\u00e9quence de l\u2019ordre interlocutoire de la cour, il s\u2019agissait, en plus, de savoir si la loi de la province de Qu\u00e9bec autorisait le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u00e0 s\u2019immiscer dans, l\u2019ex\u00e9cution du legs fiduciaire et permettait \u00e0 la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure de surveiller et de contr\u00f4ler cette ex\u00e9cution, ainsi que, au besoin, de proc\u00e9der elle-m\u00eame, \u00e0 la distribution des deniers.\nNous constatons que ces pouvoirs n\u2019existent pas, mais qu\u2019ils se bornent au droit de destitution dans les cas o\u00f9 le fiduciaire dissipe, gaspille ou dilapide les biens re\u00e7us ou n\u00e9glige de mettre \u00e0 ex\u00e9cution les dispositions du testament. Nous avons vu que cette raison d\u2019intervenir n\u2019existe pas dans le moment. Il n\u2019est pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que l\u2019intervention, \u00e0 cette phase de l\u2019affaire, pourrait amener d\u2019autres r\u00e9sultats imm\u00e9diats. Il n\u2019y a donc aucune utilit\u00e9 pour cette cour \u00e0 se prononcer sur le droit abstrait de la Couronne.\nCe point important pourra \u00eatre tranch\u00e9 lorsque sa solution sera n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision d\u2019un proc\u00e8s et susceptible d\u2019apporter des r\u00e9sultats d\u2019ordre pratique. Tel n\u2019est pas le cas ici o\u00f9 nous pouvons juger la cause sans entrer dans ces consid\u00e9rations. Le but de la cour a \u00e9t\u00e9 atteint; le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral est inform\u00e9 de la situation; il pourra prendre en temps et lieu les proc\u00e9dures qui pourront s\u2019imposer; et tous ses droits \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard seront express\u00e9ment r\u00e9serv\u00e9s par le jugement, qui n\u2019entend se prononcer en aucune fa\u00e7on sur la nature de ses pouvoirs et de ses attributions en la mati\u00e8re. La cour d\u00e9sirait savoir si, dans son jugement, qui a pour effet de confirmer la saisine des biens au l\u00e9gataire fiduciaire, elle pouvait, dans les limites permises par la loi, ins\u00e9rer des mesures qui auraient garanti et assur\u00e9 davantage l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de la volont\u00e9 de la testatrice. Ces pouvoirs ne paraissent pas exister. C\u2019est au procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral qu\u2019il appartiendra de juger si, en s\u2019inspirant des suggestions faites par les commissaires du Code civil, il y a lieu d\u2019adopter plus ample l\u00e9gislation pour l\u2019avenir.\nL\u2019appel est rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens; et la cour d\u00e9clare qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas lieu pour le moment de recevoir l\u2019intervention du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, mais lui r\u00e9serve tous ses droits \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard pour l\u2019avenir.\nLamont J. concurred with Rinfret J.\nSmith J.\u2014I agree with what has been written by my brother Rinfret, and with the observations added by My Lord the Chief Justice.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Geoffrion & Prud\u2019homme.\nSolicitor for the respondents: Joseph B. de Boucherville.\nSolicitor for the Atty.

Weidman v. Shragge (46 Can. S.C.R. 1) foll.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, dismissing the appellants\u2019 appeal from a conviction and sentence rendered on the 29th January, 1926, when the trial judge, Wilson J., found the appellants guilty of a charge laid under section 498 of the Criminal Code and fined each of the appellants the sum of $2,000.\nThe material facts of the case are stated in the judgment now reported.\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. and W. F. Chipman K.C. for the appellants.\nErnest Bertrand K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nMignault J.\u2014Stinson-Reeb Builders\u2019 Supply Co., Limited, W. & F. P. Currie & Co., Limited, and Ontario Gypsum Co., Limited, appeal from a judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench affirming their conviction on an indictment laid against them under section 498 of the Criminal Code. This indictment contains the following counts:\u2014\nFor having\nat the city of Montreal, during the years 1924 and 1925, doing business together with other unknown persons, conspired, combined, agreed and arranged with each other and other persons unknown with view to unduly limit the facilities for producing, manufacturing, supplying and dealing in that certain commodity or article known as gypsum products, which said products are the subjects of trade and commerce;\nFor having\nat the same time and place, conspired, combined, agreed and arranged with each other and with other persons unknown to restrain, injure trade and commerce in relation to such gypsum products;\nFor having\nat the same time and place, unduly prevented and lessened competition in the purchase, sale and supply of such commodity and enhanced the price of the said commodity commonly known as gypsum products.\nThe appellants, with their consent, were tried before a judge (Mr. Justice Wilson) without a jury, were found guilty on the three counts and were sentenced to pay a fine of $2,000 each.\nThey appealed from their conviction to the Court of King\u2019s Bench on questions stated to be questions of law alone, and on questions stated to be questions of mixed law and fact. These appeals, heard before Howard, Bernier and Rivard, JJ., were dismissed. Leave having been given to pronounce separate judgments, Mr. Justice Howard delivered a dissenting judgment, and the appellants now appeal on his grounds of dissent. They had also applied for special leave to appeal to this court on the question of the constitutionality of section 498, but, as no conflict was shewn between the judgment of the court below and the judgment of any other court of appeal, the application was dismissed[1]. The validity of section 498 Or. C, therefore, is not in issue in this case, the only question submitted on the appeal, as I conceive it should be expressed, being whether there was evidence on which a jury properly directed or a judge sitting without a jury could convict the appellants on the charges laid against them. This is of course a question of law, and it is on this point that Howard J. dissented.\nSection 498 of the Criminal Code\u2014and we are concerned merely with its effect\u2014is in a subdivision of the code bearing the title \u201cOffences connected with trade and breaches of contract.\u201d It will be convenient to cite here sections 496, 497, 498 Cr. C, which together form a group dealing with what is known as \u201crestraint of trade.\u201d\n496. A conspiracy in restraint of trade is an agreement between two or more persons to do or procure to be done any unlawful act in restraint of trade. 497. The purposes of a trade union are not, by reason merely that they are in restraint of trade, unlawful within the meaning of the last preceding section.\n498. Every one is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to a penalty not exceeding four thousand dollars and not less than two hundred dollars, or to two years\u2019 imprisonment, or, if a corporation, is liable to a penalty not exceeding ten thousand dollars, and not less than one thousand dollars, who conspires, combines, agrees or arranges with any other person, or with any railway, steamship, steamboat or transportation company,\u2014\n(a) to unduly limit the facilities for transporting, producing, manufacturing, supplying, storing or dealing in any article or commodity which may be a subject of trade and commerce; or,\n(b) to restrain or injure trade or commerce in relation to any such article or commodity; or,\n(c) to unduly prevent, limit, or lessen the manufacture or production of any such article or commodity, or to unreasonably enhance the price thereof; or,\n(d) to unduly prevent or lessen competition in the production, manufacturing, purchase, barter, sale;, transportation or supply of any such article or commodity, or in the price of insurance upon person or property.\n2. Nothing in this section shall be construed to apply to combinations of workmen or employees for their own reasonable protection as such workmen or employees.\nThese provisions, and more especially section 498 Cr. C., were construed by this court in Weidman v. Shragge[2], which, although not a criminal case, is authority with regard to their meaning. I may quote what was stated by Mr. Justice Duff at p. 37:\u2014\nI have no hesitation in holding that as a rule an agreement having for one of its direct and governing objects the establishment of a virtual monopoly in the trade in an important article of commerce throughout a considerable extent of territory by suppressing competition in that trade, comes under the ban of the enactment.\nAnd Mr. Justice Anglin (as he then was), discussing the meaning of the expression \u201cunduly\u201d in section 498 Cr. C, said at p. 42:\u2014\nThe prime question certainly must be, does it (the agreement alleged to foe obnoxious to section 498), however advantageous or even necessary for the protection of the business interests of the parties, impose improper, inordinate, excessive or oppressive restrictions upon that competition the benefit of which is the right of every one?\nIn view of this statement of the rule, it will be unnecessary to refer to any of the English cases on which the appellants rely. What we have to determine is whether there is evidence bringing this case within the statute. There does not appear to be any dispute as to the material facts.\nAbout the end of 1913 an association called \u201cthe plasterers\u2019 association\u201d was formed between certain manufacturers of gypsum products and certain dealers in these commodities. It was composed of two branches, the manufacturers and the dealers. There were four manufacturers: The Albert Manufacturing Company, Limited, of Hillsborough, N.B.; The Windsor Plaster Company, Limited, of Windsor, N.S.; The Iona Gypsum Company, Limited, of Iona, N.S., and The Ontario Gypsum Company, of Paris, Ontario. There were originally six dealers, all of Montreal: Alex. Bremner, Limited; Sitinson-Reeb Builders\u2019 Supply Co., Limited; Wm. McNally & Co., Limited; Webster & Sons, Limited; W. and F. P. Currie & Co., Limited, and Hyde & Sons.\nAlmost from the beginning and at all the times with which we are concerned, one Alfred E. Balfry of Montreal was the secretary of the association and practically its factotum, being paid by the manufacturers and the dealers, and he also acted as chairman at the occasional meetings of the association held in Montreal at his office, for the renting of which, and other expenses, the members paid. There were also meetings of the dealers alone, and at these Balfry presided, besides acting as secretary. Minutes of proceedings at meetings were kept by Balfry. The association was not incorporated.\nI think there is no doubt that the forming of this association was an advantage to its members. From the manufacturers\u2019 point of view the question of freights, and of the quantities of gypsum products to be shipped to Montreal, was a material consideration. The freight rates were equalized, by taking as a basis the rate from Hillsborough, N.B., to Montreal. The manufacturers fixed their sale prices to the dealers, and also the price at which the latter would sell their products on the Montreal market, and no sales could be made for a lesser price. As far as concerned the Montreal market, the manufacturers agreed to sell to the dealers exclusively, and the dealers could buy only from the manufacturers. Orders by dealers for goods were handed by them to Balfry who distributed these orders among the manufacturers. The testimony shews that, as matters stood, the trade in Montreal could get these products only from the dealers, and through the latter from the manufacturers\/Shipments by other and more distant manufacturers to Montreal were impracticable on account of the freight rates and because, if a large quantity of products was shipped to Montreal, it would have to be stored, which would increase its selling price. That a monopoly of the trade in Montreal in gypsum products was secured by the plasterers\u2019 association does not appear to be open to doubt.\nIt may be emphasized here that the advantage thus obtained by the manufacturers and dealers of the association is not the proper test. What is the true test was laid down by this court in Weidman v. Shragge[3] as above stated. Injury to the public by the hindering or suppressing of free competition, notwithstanding any advantage which may accrue to the business interests of the members of the combine, is what brings an agreement or a combination under the ban of section 498 Cr. C.\nThis injury is shewn by what occurred in January, 1925. The six dealers met on\u2019 January 13, passed a resolution dissolving their association, and very shortly afterwards reformed it with five members instead of six, Hyde & Sons, who say they did not vote on the question of dissolution, being excluded. Of the forming of what he called a \u201cfamily of five\u201d Balfry immediately advised the manufacturers. The effect of the exclusion of Hyde & Sons was soon painfully apparent to the latter. They booked with Balfry orders for gypsum products which they required to fill contracts that they had made with builders. These products they were unable to procure either through Balfry or by applying directly to the manufacturers. They were told, to go to one of the five dealers, which meant purchasing the goods at a considerably higher price, about $2 per ton more than the selling price of the manufacturers to the dealers. This rendered it impossible for them to fulfil their contracts and carry on their business. Balfry is very frank as to the policy adopted towards Hyde & Sons. He is asked:\u2014\nQ. What objection had you to this plaster coming to Montreal\u2014what business had you in that\u2014what interests had you in that?\nA. To see that Hyde did not get any plaster in Montrea, Q. Why did you not want Mr. Hyde to have plaster in Montreal?\nA. Because I had made arrangements to supply it only to the five other firms.\nCounsel for the appellants contend that this is merely a case of a manufacturer freely choosing or changing his selling agents. It is very much more. It is a combination of manufacturers and dealers to control an important market wherein the goods in which they deal can be obtained only through them and at prices which they determine, free competition by others in the same market being suppressed.\nThis was clearly shewn in the case of one O\u2019Neil who, shortly before the exclusion of Hyde & Sons, had brought to Montreal and stored there a large shipment of plaster. When he attempted to compete with the dealers, the latter reduced their prices, this operation being repeated several times, as O\u2019Neil reduced his, so that eventually O\u2019Neil was forced out of the market and constrained to sell the balance of his stock to one of the dealers. This is represented by the appellants as being merely a rate war brought about by O\u2019Neil\u2019s action in underselling the dealers. I think it shews that the association had rendered competition impossible in the Montreal market. The evidence demonstrates that the manufacturers controlled the price at which these goods were sold by the dealers to the public. Just one quotation from the testimony of Balfry will establish this:\u2014\nQ. Dealers, as members of the association, after having bought, under your control, from the manufacturers, were not at liberty to sell to the public at whatever price they liked. Were they bound to sell at a fixed price, and at fixed terms?\nA. They were compelled at the price the manufacturers thought right to charge the public.\nQ. The dealers were not at liberty to sell to suit their convenience?\nA. I suppose, if they got into collaboration with the manufacturers, they might be able to induce the manufacturers to do what they wanted.\nBy Mr, Bertrand, K.C.:\nQ. They had to sell at a fixed price?\nA. Yes.\nBy the Court:\nQ. Not only the price, but the terms also?\nA. Yes.\nThe prosecution here is against two of the dealers and one of the manufacturers. I think these three companies agreed to all that was done, and it is no objection that the others were not charged under the same indictment.\nMy conclusion is that there was evidence on which the learned judge could find the appellants guilty of an offence against section 498 of the Criminal Code, subsections (a), (b) and (d).\nThe appeal should therefore be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Brown, Montgomery & McMichael.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Ernest Bertrand.\n[1] [1928] S.C.R. 402.\n[2] (1912) 46 Can.

Canadian Credit Men's Trust Assoc., [1929] S.C.R. 282\nDate: 1929-02-05\nDavid Garson and Another (Defendants) Appellants:\nand\nCanadian Credit Men\u2019s Trust Association (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1928: November 5; 1929: February 5.\nPresent: Duff, Newcombe, Rinfret, Lamont and Smith JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA EN BANC\nSale of goods\u2014Stock in trade\u2014Sale in bulk\u2014Non-compliance with Bulk Sales Act\u2014Assignment of the vendor\u2014Resale by the transferee to a bona fide purchaser\u2014Right of the trustee in bankruptcy to compel the transferee to account\u2014Bulk Sales Act, R.S.N.S. (1928), c. 202\u2014Assignments Act, R.S.N.S. (1928), c. 200.\nIn January, 1928, one C. sold all the stock in trade and assets of his business to the appellants for $1,600. On March 17, 1928, C. made an authorized assignment in bankruptcy, and his statement showed liabilities amounting to $4,395.55 with cash assets of $706. The sale of the stock in trade to the appellants was a sale in bulk under the Bulk Sales Act, but there was no compliance whatever with the provisions of that Act. At the time of the sale the appellants paid the purchase money to C. in cash and they resold the goods for $2,000 (before the respondent, as trustee in bankruptcy, moved to set aside the sale to them from C. The $2,000 were not ear-marked and have been disposed of by them in the ordinary course of their business.\nHeld that the respondent, on behalf of the creditors, was entitled to have the appellants account for the $2,000 received by them on the resale of the goods. The creation in the Bulk Sales Act of a presumption of fraud on the part of both purchaser and vendor as against the vendor\u2019s creditors, indicates a legislative intention to put a sale in bulk made without compliance with that Act in the same category as sales made with an intention to defraud the vendor\u2019s creditors. This presumption of fraud has the effect of bringing into play all other statutes passed for the protection of creditors against a fraudulent sale of his goods by a debtor to the prejudice of his creditors, and the right to recover from a fraudulent transferee the proceeds of goods coming into his possession by an invalid transfer, and resold by him, is given by s. 21 (1) of the Assignments Act (R.S.N.S. (1928), c. 200).\nAPPEAL, by special leave of this court[1], from the decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc, affirming the judgment of Carroll J. and maintaining the respondent\u2019s action.\nThe material facts of the case are fully stated in the above head-note.\nV. J. Pottier and A. C. Hill K.C. for the appellants.\nW. C. MacDonald K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nLamont J.\u2014The material facts in this appeal are few, and are not in dispute. In October, 1927, one Wellsley G. Crouse commenced business as a retail merchant in Middleton, N.S. In January, 1928, he sold all the stock in trade and assets of his business to the appellants for $1,600. On March 17, 1928, he made an authorized assignment in bankruptcy, and his statement shewed liabilities amounting to $4,395.55, with cash assets of $706. The sale of the stock in trade to the appellants was a sale in bulk under the Bulk Spies Act, but there was no compliance whatever with the provisions of that Act. At the time of the sale the appellants paid the purchase money to Crouse in cash, and they resold the goods for $2,000 before the respondent, as trustee in bankruptcy, moved to set aside the sale to them from Crouse. The $2,000 received by the appellants when they resold the goods were not ear-marked, and have been disposed of by them in the ordinary course of their business. The matter was brought before the court by way of stated case, in which it was agreed that no objection was to be taken to the status of the trustee, and the following questions were submitted to the court:\u2014\n1. Whether said sale was and is fraudulent and absolutely void under the Bulk Sales Act as against the creditors of said Wellsley G. Crouse in existence at the time of such assignment. 2. Whether said creditors are entitled to be paid by Garson & Lipwich the sum of $2,000, being an amount equal to the amount realized on the resale of said stock-in-trade.\n3. Whether the costs of this case should be paid by the trustee or by Garson and Lipwich.\nMr. Justice Carroll, before whom the matter came in the first instance, answered questions 1 and 2 in the affirmative, and directed the costs to be paid out of the bankrupt estate by the trustee. On appeal, the judgment of Carroll J. was affirmed by the Nova Scotia Supreme Court en banc, that court being of opinion that the trustee was entitled to recover the value of the property from the appellants under ss. 29 and 33 (now ss. 60 and 66) of the Bankruptcy Act.\nGarson and Lipwich now appeal to this court.\nThe Bulk Sales Act defines the duty of both vendor and purchaser where a purchase is made for cash or on credit of any stock of goods, wares and merchandise, in bulk. S. 2 requires the vendor to furnish a statement, verified by statutory declaration, setting out the names and addresses of his creditors, and the amount due to each. It also requires the purchaser to obtain such statement before closing the purchase and paying to the vendor any part of the purchase price. S. 3 requires that the agreement to purchase shall be in writing, and shall be filed in the Registry Office within ten days after execution thereof, and that no part of the purchase price or any security therefor shall be delivered within thirty days next after the execution of the agreement. S. 4 provides that if a purchase be made, and any part of the purchase price or any security therefor be paid or delivered to the vendor by the purchaser before receiving the vendor\u2019s statement, as required by s. 2, or without filing the agreement, as required by s. 3, the sale shall be Deemed to be fraudulent, and shall be absolutely void as against the creditors of the vendor, unless the proceeds of such sale are sufficient to pay the vendor\u2019s creditors in full, and are, in fact, actually applied in or towards payment of their claims. S. 5 provides that the purchaser, upon obtaining such statutory declaration from the vendor, must either obtain the written consent to his purchase, of creditors representing at least fifty per cent. in number and value of the claims, as shewn by the statutory declaration, or notified to the purchaser, or, if the purchase price is sufficient to pay the creditors in full, must pay the whole of the purchase price or deliver the securities therefor into the hands of a trustee for distribution pro rata among the creditors; and, in default of so doing, the sale shall be deemed fraudulent, and be void.\nIt is now common ground between the parties that in the Bulk Sales Act the word \u201cvoid\u201d means \u201cvoidable\u201d only and that a sale made without compliance with the Act is valid unless and until the creditors of the vendor elect to have it set aside. The fact that the Act avoids the sale only as against the vendor\u2019s creditors indicates an intention on the part of the legislature that on the sale the property in the goods shall pass, subject to the right of the creditors to have the sale set aside as fraudulent against them.\nIt is also common ground that if the goods are resold by the fraudulent transferee to a bona fide purchaser for value without notice, before the creditors challenge the validity of the sale, such purchaser has a valid title to the goods and the creditors cannot recover them. The question before us therefore is, are the creditors entitled to have the appellants account for the $2,000 received by them on the resale of the goods?\nFor the appellants it is contended that the question should be answered in the negative because[2] the appellants were not debtors of the creditors or any of them, and (2) as they had resold the goods at a time when the sale was still a valid one, the goods themselves in their hands were not clothed with any trust in favour of the creditors and consequently no trust could be impressed upon the proceeds thereof; that in the absence of an indebtedness on the part of the appellants, or of a trust in favour of the creditors, the appellants cannot be called upon to account for any proceeds received by them.\nIt is, no doubt, true that the appellants were not, in the ordinary sense of the term, debtors of the creditors, nor, unless made so by the Act, were the proceeds of the sale imposed with any trust in the creditors\u2019 favour. That, however, in our opinion, is not conclusive in favour of the appellants.\nThe object of the Bulk Sales Act is to prevent a trader from making a sale in bulk of his stock-in-trade, goods and merchandise without the consent of his creditors thereto or the payment of their claims. To effect this object the Act imposes a duty upon any intending purchaser not to complete the purchase or pay any part of the purchase price with out complying with the provisions of the Act. If he fails to perform that duty the Act declares that the sale\nshall be deemed to be fraudulent and shall be absolutely void as against the creditors.\n\u201cDeemed to be fraudulent\u201d here means that although the purchaser may not in fact have been guilty of fraud, yet the sale is to be considered as one based upon the existence of actual fraud and carrying with it all the consequences of a fraudulent sale. The Queen v. County Council of Norfolk[3].\nAs a consequence of such a sale the Act provides that the creditors may have it declared void and set aside.\nThe appellants contend that this is the creditors\u2019 only remedy and that the effect of setting aside the sale as invalid is merely to remove the impediment standing in the way of the enforcement of the creditors\u2019 executions against the goods sold, and they cited a number of authorities to the effect that where a fraudulent sale was set aside the creditors could follow the proceeds if the fund could be found in specie, or if it was so ear-marked that it could be traced; but that if it could not be found in specie, or was not so ear-marked, the creditors could not compel an accounting thereof. In re Mouat[4]; Ross v. Dunn[5]; Davis v. Wickson[6]. In our opinion the removal of the impediment which intercepted the action of the creditors\u2019 writs of execution was not the only effect which it was intended the legislation should have. Had that been the only effect intended there was no necessity whatever for enacting that the sale should be deemed fraudulent. The setting aside of the sale as invalid would, without branding it as fraudulent, have been sufficient to remove the impediment to the operation of the writs of execution. The creation of a statutory presumption of fraud on the part of both purchaser and vendor as against the vendor\u2019s creditors, indicates, in our opinion, a legislative intention to put a sale in bulk made without compliance with the Bulk Sales Act in the same category as sales made with an intention to defraud the vendor\u2019s creditors. Such intent the Act presumes to exist, and this presumption of fraud has the effect of bringing into play all other statutes passed for the protection of creditors against a fraudulent sale of his goods by a debtor to the prejudice of his creditors. So that if, in any such statute, the legislature has given to the creditors any remedy in addition to their right to have the sale set aside as invalid, the creditors of a fraudulent debtor under the Bulk Sales Act are entitled to claim the benefit of such remedy, provided, of course, that all the conditions precedent to the right to claim the remedy have been fulfilled. One such remedy, namely, a right to recover from a fraudulent transferee the proceeds of goods coming into his possession by an invalid transfer, and resold by him, is given by the Assignments Act (R.S.N.S. 1923, c. 200), which in part reads:\u2014\n4. (1) Every transfer of property made by an insolvent person\n(a) with intent to defeat, hinder, delay or prejudice his creditors, or any one or more of them:\nShall as against the creditor or creditors injured, delayed, prejudiced or postponed, be utterly void.\n21. (1) In the case of a transfer of any property which in law is invalid against creditors, if the person to whom the transfer was made shall have sold or disposed of, realized or collected, the property or any part thereof, the money or other proceeds may be seized or recovered in any action by a person who would be entitled to seize and recover the property if it has remained in the possession or control of the debtor or of the persons to whom the transfer was made and such right to seize and recover shall belong, not only to an assignee for the general benefit of the creditors of the said debtor, but in case there is no such assignment shall exist in favour of all creditors of such debtor.\nThat Crouse was insolvent is not disputed. The sale and delivery of his goods to the appellants was a transfer of property which in law was invalid as against his creditors. If the goods had remained in the hands of the appellants the creditors, on setting aside the sale, would have been entitled to recover them as goods belonging to the debtor. The appellants having resold the goods the creditors are, by s. 21, expressly given the right to recover the proceeds thereof from them. This right the creditors now seek to enforce, and, in our opinion, they are entitled to enforce it. As the Assignments Act has made provision for the very remedy which the creditors through the plaintiff seek to enforce, it is unnecessary to consider whether or not the Bulk Sales Act alone, or with the aid of the Bankruptcy Act, would entitle the creditors to the same remedy, and upon that question we express no opinion.\nWhen Crouse assigned the only asset which he turned over to the respondent was $706 in cash. It is not shewn in the stated case whether or not this was part of the $1,600 paid to Crouse by the appellants. If it was, the respondent, having received that part of the purchase price of the goods, would not be entitled to have it paid over again. If, therefore, the appellants so desire they may have an inquiry to ascertain if the $706 received by the respondent constituted \u00e0 part of the purchase money received by Crouse. Such inquiry, however, will be at their own expense.\nThe appeal should therefore be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: V. J.

Co. $2,000 for royalties accrued under an agreement by which T. Co. had granted G. certain rights to manufacture under a tube patent owned by T. Co. Being pressed for payment, G. got M. to sign and hand to him a promissory note for $2,000 payable to T. Co., which G. endorsed and delivered to T. Co., which accepted it, reserving its rights for payment of the royalties if the note was not paid. After maturity T. Co. transferred the note for value to plaintiff who sued M. and G. upon it. Defendants, among other things, pleaded s. 14 of the Bills of Exchange Act. At the trial it was dis- closed (neither T. Co. nor plaintiff having had any previous knowledge thereof) that M. had purchased from G. an interest in a certain tire patent (in which T. Co. had no interest). It was held by the Appellate Division, Ont., that the money owing by M. to G. on said purchase was the consideration for which the note was given, and, as the words \u201cGiven for a patent right\u201d were not written across it, the note was void under s. 14 of said Act.\nHeld (Lamont J. dissenting): The note was not void. The consideration was not purchase money for a patent right or interest therein. Consideration must move from the payee (Forsyth v. Forsyth, 13 N.S. Rep. 380; Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co. Ltd. v. Selfridge & Co. Ltd. [1915] AC. 847); the consideration for M.\u2019s promise by the note to pay T. Co. could not be a debt due by M. to G., although that debt might have been the motive inducing M. to hand it to G. Nor, in the circumstances, could it be said that the consideration consisted in the royalties due by G. to T. Co.; the note was not taken in satisfaction of that claim; there was no novation. The real consideration given by the payee was the extension of time to G. for payment of the royalties due by him. The fact that M., who owed nothing to T. Co., made the note to it, must have conveyed to him that, at G.\u2019s request, he was undertaking to pay T. Co. for some consideration moving from it (even if unknown to him) in which G. was interested, and to enable G. to obtain which he was accommodating G., and implied a request from M. to T. Co. to accord such consideration. (Craig v. M. & L. Samuel, Benjamin & Co., 24 Can. S.C.R. 278, dist.)\nRoyalties for a license to manufacture under a patent are not purchase money of a patent right. (Johnson v. Martin, 19 Ont. A.R. 593, explained).\nHeld also (as to G.\u2019s contention, invoking s. 131 of said Act, that he was not really an endorser of the note because he was not the holder when he signed it and did not sign it for the purpose of negotiation, and that plaintiff could recover against him only if he was a holder in due course) that G.\u2019s. endorsement on the note before T. Co. took it had the effect of an \u201caval\u201d, and made G. liable to T. Co. and its assignee, the plaintiff\u2014Robinson v. Mann, 31 Can. S.C.R. 484; Grant v. Scott, 59 Can. S.C.R. 227. (Moreover, as pointed out in Steele v. McKinley, 5 A.C. 754, \u201cit is not a collateral engagement, but one on the bill,\u201d this disposing of any contention of G. under the Statute of Frauds). R.E. Jones Ltd. v. Waring & Gillow Ltd., [1926] A.C., 670, which laid down the general proposition that \u201cholder in due course\u201d does not include a payee, had not the effect of overruling Robinson v. Mann. It cannot be said that, by force of s. 131 of the Bills of Exchange Act, one who signs a bill otherwise than as drawer or acceptor incurs liability only towards a holder in due course. The concluding words of s. 131, \u201cand is subject to all the provisions of this Act respecting endorsers,\u201d distinguish it from the corresponding English section, and make clear the intention to introduce into our law the principle of the \u201caval.\u201d\nJudgment of the Appellate Division, Ont., (34 O.W.N. 204) reversed (Lamont J. dissenting). APPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1] which allowed the defendants\u2019 appeal from the judgment of Riddell J. at trial[2], who held that the plaintiff was entitled to recover against the defendants upon a certain promissory note. The material facts of the case, and the questions in issue, are sufficiently stated in the judgments now reported, and are indicated in the above head-note. The plaintiff\u2019s appeal was allowed with costs in this Court and the Appellate Division and the judgment of the trial Court was restored. Lamont J., dissented.\nR.S. Robertson K.C. for the appellant.\nJ.M. Bullen for the respondent Murphy.\nT. Delany for the respondent Gilroy.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C. and Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.) was delivered by\nRINFRET J.\u2014The action is upon a promissory note for $2,000, dated June 28, 1926, made by Murphy and payable to the order of Travellers Rubber Company, Limited, six months after date. The note was endorsed by Gilroy before its delivery to the Travellers Company. It was transferred for value, but after maturity, to Gallagher, who does not claim to stand in any higher position than the company.\nMurphy and Gilroy filed separate statements of defence, each containing a variety of reasons why the action should not be maintained. At the trial, none of these reasons prevailed. The Appellate Division, however, held that the consideration for the note consisted of the purchase money of an interest in a patent right, within the meaning of section 14 of the Bills of Exchange Act, and that the note was void because the words \u201cGiven for a patent right\u201d were not \u201cwritten or printed * * * across the face thereof.\u201d\nWe adopt as correct the following statement of the circumstances under which the note was given:\nIn June, 1926, Gilroy owed the Travellers Company $2,000 for royalties accrued under an agreement by which the company had granted Gilroy certain rights to manufacture under a patent owned by the company upon an inner tube for an automobile tire. Gilroy was pressed for payment, but was unable to pay. He stated, however, that he had a \u201cfriend,\u201d Murphy, from whom he could get a note. He accordingly got Murphy to make the note in question payable to the company. He then put his own signature as endorser on the back of the note and delivered it to the company. The company accepted it, reserving its rights for the payment of the royalties due under the agreement, if the note was not paid; and both Murphy and Gilroy were so notified by letter. Murphy replied on July 16, 1926, that he would take up the note before maturity, on the last day of November, and that the company could depend upon this.\nThe note was dishonoured at maturity and the company sued Murphy upon it. Murphy filed an affidavit of merits. Gallagher, who was acting as the company\u2019s solicitor, finding that there was some dispute about his retainer, discontinued the action; but, as the company was indebted to him, he secured an assignment to himself of the note and of the company\u2019s claim in respect thereof. The present action was thereupon brought against Murphy and Gilroy. At the trial, it was unexpectedly disclosed that Murphy had acquired an interest in a patent owned by Gilroy, not the tube patent in respect of which royalties were owing by Gilroy, but a tire patent in which the company was not interested.\nNeither the company nor Gallagher had any knowledge of this transaction between Gilroy and Murphy. They never heard of it until the evidence was given at the trial. Up to that time Murphy had always been put forward as maker of the note for Gilroy\u2019s accommodation. In the affidavit of merits filed in answer to the action brought by the company, he swore that \u201cthe promissory note upon which the plaintiff has entered action herein was given by (him) for accommodation only.\u201d No mention was there made of his having purchased from Gilroy an interest in a patent right.\nIn the statements of defence, the note was referred to by both Gilroy and Murphy as having been given \u201cfor accommodation only; or, if for consideration, then such consideration was an interest in a patent right\u201d; but the \u201cinterest in a patent right\u201d to which it was intended to refer in these pleadings was not Murphy\u2019s purchase of a half interest in Gilroy\u2019s tire patent (which, as already stated, was brought out fortuitously at the trial) but the overdue royalties in respect of the license to manufacture granted by the company to Gilroy under the tube patent. Nevertheless, the purchase money owing by Murphy to Gilroy for this half interest in Gilroy\u2019s tire patent right was, in the opinion of the Appellate Division, the consideration for which the note in question was given. For that reason, as the words \u201cGiven for a patent right\u201d were not written across it, the note was held void and the action was dismissed.\nWith respect, we are unable to agree with this view.\nConsideration must move from the payee. (Forsyth v. Forsyth[3]; Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co. Ltd. v. Selfridge[4]).\nThe note was a promise by Murphy to pay $2,000 to the Travellers Rubber Company, Limited. The consideration for such a promise could not be a debt due by Murphy to Gilroy; that would afford no reason why Murphy should promise to pay the Travellers Company.\nThen if Gilroy, as endorser, paid the note at maturity, Murphy\u2019s debt to him would not be extinguished. If Murphy paid it, this debt would be extinguished pro tanto, only through the process of set off and not directly because he paid the note. Murphy\u2019s debt to Gilroy may have been the motive inducing Murphy to hand over the note to Gilroy; but it was not the consideration for the note between Murphy and the company.\nIf we should say that the consideration consisted in the royalties due by Gilroy to the company in respect of the license to manufacture under the tube patent, that statement would be more plausible. But the note was not taken in satisfaction of that claim. There was no novation. The company expressly stated in its letter of July 6 that the note was taken \u201ctowards payment of the royalties due\u201d but that it \u201creserved its rights under the agreement in case the note is not paid at maturity.\u201d Currie v. Misa[5].\nIn final analysis, the real consideration given for the note by the company (the payee) was the extension of time which it thereby gave to Gilroy for the payment of the royalties due by him. (Chalmers\u2014Bills of Exchange, 9th ed., p. 96, note n.). The company was pressing him. He replied that he had no money but could get a note from a friend. He got the note, endorsed it, and gave it to the company. Having that note, the company agreed to grant a further delay of six months for the payment of the royalties but did not give up its claim for them and did not release Gilroy. The real consideration moving from the company when it accepted the note was, therefore, the extension of time granted to Gilroy.\nThe following passage from Byles on Bills (18th ed., p. 127) well expresses our views on the point just discussed:\nA subsisting debt due from a third person is a good consideration for a bill or note, at least if the instrument be payable at a future day, for then it amounts to an agreement to give time to the original debtor, and that indulgence to him is a consideration to the maker.\nTrue it is that Murphy professes not to have known at the time that he was accommodating Gilroy, although he has since treated the note as one given for accommodation in an affidavit of merits and in his statement of defence. But the form of the note, in the light of the facts, speaks for itself. Murphy owed nothing to the Travellers Company; yet he was making this note to the order of that company. This fact must have conveyed to him that, at the request of Gilroy, he was undertaking to pay the company for some consideration moving from the latter (even if unknown to him) in which Gilroy was interested and to enable him to obtain which he was accommodating Gilroy, and implied a request from him to the company to accord such consideration.\nThis case must be distinguished from Craig v. M. & L. Samuel, Benjamin & Co.[6] There, the makers were not sued as accommodation parties and the payees were cognizant of all the circumstances. In fact, the note had been made payable to their order by their own \u201ccontrivance.\u201d Further, Mr. Justice Gwynne, speaking for the majority of the court (page 281), says:\nThe plaintiffs gave no consideration whatever to Fairgrieye and Craig, or to Craig, or to Fairgrieve, which can support their claim to recover against Craig upon the notes sued upon, and that is the sole question on this appeal. In Johnson v. Martin[7], the court was not called upon to decide whether the case was within the statute. The judgment was predicated upon the fact, assumed by court and counsel, that the notes had been given for the purchase money of a patent right. Osler J.A., begins his judgment thus: \u201cThe consideration given for the notes in question admittedly was a patent right sold,\u201d etc. This judgment, therefore, did not decide that royalties for a license to manufacture were the purchase money of a patent right. If it did, it would have to be overruled, for royalties are not purchase money. They are rather in the nature of rents. Nor is a license to manufacture an interest in a patent. The licensee has no property in the patent. (Fletcher Moulton on Patents, page 240.)\nWe think, for these reasons, that \u201cthe consideration\u201d for the note given by Murphy was not wholly or in part purchase money for an interest in a patent right. The note was not void; the action was rightly maintained against him and the judgment of the trial court should be restored.\nIn the case of Gilroy, however, a further point remains to be considered, which was raised for the first time at the argument before this court. It was claimed that Gilroy was not really an endorser of the note because he was not the holder when he signed it and he did not sign it for the purpose of negotiation. Section 131 of the Bills of Exchange Act was invoked, and it was urged that under it Gallagher could recover against Gilroy only if he was a holder in due course.\nSection 131 reads as follows:\n131. No person is liable as drawer, endorser or acceptor of a bill who has not signed it as such: provided that when a person signs a bill otherwise than as a drawer or accepter he thereby incurs the liabilities of an endorser to a holder in due course, and is subject to all the provisions of this Act respecting endorsers.\nIt will be remembered that Gilroy endorsed the note before he delivered it to the. Travellers Rubber Company. He did so for the evident purpose of becoming liable on the note to the company; in fact, no other purpose has been suggested. Moreover, under the proviso to s. 131, the case is concluded against him by the judgment of this court in Robinson v. Mann[8]. Gilroy contended that the recent decision of the House of Lords in R.E. Jones Ltd. v. Waring & Gillow Ltd.[9] had the effect of overruling Robinson v. Mann8. We do not think so. R.E. Jones Ltd. v. Waring & Gillow Ltd.9 lays down the general proposition, already contained in the judgment of Lord Russell in Lewis v. Clay[10], that the expression \u201cholder in due course\u201d does not include a payee. And it is argued that, as a result, the Travellers Rubber Company, not being a holder in due course, neither it nor its assignee Gallagher can recover against Gilroy.\nWe do not accept the proposition that, by force of s. 131, one who signs a bill otherwise than as drawer or acceptor incurs liability only towards a holder in due course, nor do we understand the decision in Robinson v. Mann8, to have depended upon the ground (although that view is no doubt expressed) that the payee was looked upon as a holder in due course. The decision was this:\nGeorge T. Mann, the respondent, endorsed a note signed by W. Mann & Co., and payable to the Molsons Bank. It was contended that he was an endorser and as such liable to the Bank to which the note so endorsed was delivered. Sir Henry Strong C.J., delivering the judgment of the court, said that \u201cby force of the statute, the endorsement operated as what has long been known in the French Commercial Law as an \u2018aval\u2019\u201d, and that the statute had adopted that \u201cform of liability.\u201d (See the explanation of Lord Blackburn in Steele v. M\u2019Kinlay[11]).\nThe corresponding section in the English Act does not contain the words \u201cand is subject to all the provisions of this Act respecting endorsers.\u201d Ever since Robinson v. Mann8 was decided, it has been considered that this addition was made in our Canadian statute with the \u201cintention of adopting the principle of the \u2018aval\u2019, as already in force in the province of Quebec.\u201d (Byles on Bills, 18th ed., pp. 163 and 164.)\nThere is no doubt that, in the light of that decision, the endorsement of Gilroy on the note before the Travellers Rubber Company took it had the effect of an \u201caval,\u201d and made Gilroy liable towards the company and its assignee, Gallagher. Moreover, as was pointed out by Lord Blackburn in the case of Steele v. M\u2019Kinlay[12] already referred to: \u201cIt is not a collateral engagement, but one on the bill\u201d; and this disposes of any argument of Gilroy under the Statute of Frauds.\nThe principle in Robinson v. Mann[13] was unanimously reasserted in Grant v. Scott, a later decision of this Court[14], where it was referred to in this way by Sir Louis Davies, the then Chief Justice:\u2014\nIt has remained now for many years unquestioned and been accepted throughout Canada as law. I see no reason for raising any doubt now upon its correctness.\nTo which the present Chief Justice added:\u2014\nThat decision has been uniformly accepted as the law of Canada in the provincial courts and by text writers of repute.\nAnd the late Mr. Justice Brodeur said, at p. 229:\u2014\nThis section [s. 131] contains an important addition to the corresponding section of the Imperial Act and it would not be advisable then to follow the British decisions.\nIt is the addition of the concluding words of s. 131 which distinguishes the Dominion from the corresponding English section and makes clear the intention to introduce into our law the principle of the \u201caval.\u201d That we understand to have been the view taken in this court both in Robinson v. Mann13 and Grant v. Scott14; and, notwithstanding the suggestion made by the distinguished author of \u201cFaiconbridge on Banking and Bills of Exchange\u201d (4th ed.), at p. 753, we do not regard those decisions as open for reconsideration here merely because of the holding by the House of Lords in R.E. Jones Ltd. v. Waring & Gillow Ltd.[15], that the payee of a note is not a holder of it in due course.\nThe consequence is that the appeal should be allowed, the judgment of the trial judge restored and the action maintained against both respondents with costs throughout.\nLAMONT J. (dissenting).\u2014As I am differing with the other members of the court in this case I naturally advance my own views with great hesitation, but I cannot escape the conviction that on the evidence before us the conclusion arrived at by the Court of Appeal was right. The important question here is one of fact: Did the defendant, Murphy, give the note in question to the defendant, Gilroy, as a payment on account of fan indebtedness which arose from the purchase by Murphy of a half interest in a patent owned by Gilroy?\nThe circumstances under which the note was given are as follows:\u2014\nJohn Schwab was the original owner of patent no. 230027, which was an invention for improving automobile tubes. In December, 1923, he agreed to assign the patent to Gilroy who was to form a company with a capital stock of $300,000 divided into 10,000 preference shares and 20,000 ordinary shares, all of $10 each. Gilroy covenanted that upon the company being organized he would cause 2,500 fully paid up ordinary shares to be allotted to Schwab, and that he would sell 5,000 preference shares as soon as possible, out of which Schwab was to be paid $25,000. Gilroy also covenanted that the company would employ Schwab as superintendent of the manufacturing of tubes under the patent at a salary of $250 a month. A company called the Travellers\u2019 Rubber Company was formed and to it Gilroy transferred the patent, and was to receive therefor $25,000 and 20,000 ordinary shares (fully paid up and non-assessable) of the company\u2019s capital stock.\nOn April 24, 1924, Gilroy, Schwab and the company entered into an agreement by which the company agreed to pay to Schwab the $25,000 due him from Gilroy, and Schwab released Gilroy from any liability in reference thereto. The shares of the company would not sell. Only 7 ten-dollar preference shares were ever subscribed for, and $65 was all the money ever received by the company from the sale of its shares (Ex. 7); The company, having no money to manufacture tubes, on January 2, 1925, granted to Gilroy and one Macdonald the exclusive license to manufacture tubes under the patent subject to payment of a royalty of $1,000 for the first year and $2,000 for the second year, and after that 50 cents a tube. At that time Gilroy owned another patent for an improvement in automobile tires.\nSome time prior to giving the note in question in this action, Gilroy sold a half interest in the tire patent to Murphy for $7,500, and received $3,000 of the purchase money. On June 28, 1926, Gilroy, being indebted to the company for royalties in the sum of $2,000, went to see Murphy (who was an old man seventy-seven years of age) and the note in question, which was made payable to the company, was signed by Murphy. Gilroy endorsed his name on this note and then handed it to the plaintiff on behalf of the company of which he was manager de facto as well as solicitor. At the trial Gilroy gave the following evidence:\u2014\nMr. TOOGOOD: What arrangement was made with Murphy whereby he gave this note?\u2014A. The arrangement with Murphy was that he was to have an interest in my tire patents.\nQ. Was that the consideration between yourself and Murphy?\u2014A. Was an interest in my tire patents.\n* * * * *\nCROSS-EXAMINED BY MR. BULLEN:\nQ. You sold Mr. Murphy an interest in a patent?\u2014A. Absolutely.\nQ. And he paid you some money on that interest?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. I have a cheque here from Mr. Murphy to Mr. Gilroy for $3,000, endorsed by you?\u2014A. Quite right.\nQ. And then subsequently he gave you this note sued on in this action as a further payment?\u2014A. As a further payment.\nQ. In connection with the same patent?\u2014A. Yes, and when it came due I was to renew it if he could not pay it.\n* * * * *\nCROSS-EXAMINED BY MR. ROBERTSON:\nQ. On your examination you did say that you never discussed with Murphy the question of an interest in the patents?\u2014A. I did not on the tube patents.\nQ. Here is what you say, question 17 * * * \u201cNow what interest in the patent right was he to receive?\u2014A. Never discussed.\u201d Is that correct?\u2014A. Quite correct it has never been discussed with Murphy and I, anything in connection with the tube patents.\nQ. That is this patent here that this company is interested in?\u2014A. No, this company is not interested.\nQ. It was some other patent, was it?\u2014A. Yes, my tire patent.\nQ. And you had some dealings with him. As a matter of fact he was going to take an interest in your business?\u2014A. No, in my tire.\nQ. Well, in your tire business?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. And question 113 you were asked: \u201cWhen you were getting Murphy to sign the note did you tell him it was for an interest in a patent right?\u2014A. No.\u201d And it was not, was it?\u2014A. An interest in the patent right certainly, it was my tire patent.\nQ. Why did you make that answer?\u2014A. It is not in the tube, Murphy is not in the tube patent, in the tire patent.\nQ. Some other patent you had. You have not any other agreement in writing with him?\u2014A. No.\nQ. And he was to get something and he gave you a note on account?\u2014A. Yes. His LORDSHIP: Mr. Gilroy has given a perfectly straightforward and apparently honest account of the transaction. He owed the company some money, Gallagher wanted to get that money, Gilroy had a deal with Murphy, Murphy gave him this note on account and Gilroy endorsed it over to Gallagher for the company.\n* * * * *\nBY MR. BULLEN:\nI see the note is made payable to the Travellers\u2019 Rubber Company, Limited, by Mr. Murphy.\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Why was that done?\u2014A. To give it to the company as royalties.\nQ. Mr. Murphy was not in any way indebted to the Travellers\u2019 Rubber Company?\u2014A. No.\nQ. There was no consideration passing from the Travellers\u2019 Rubber Company to Murphy?\u2014A. No.\nQ. And the sole consideration was the interest in the patents to you?\u2014A. Yes.\nAnd Murphy testified as follows:\u2014\nQ. Who did you give that note to (Exhibit No. 1) It says pay to the order of Travellers\u2019 Rubber Company, Limited, $2,000. Who did you give the note to?\u2014A. I presume to Mr. Gilroy, I am not sure.\nQ. Now try and think, and don\u2019t presume. You gave it to whom?\u2014A. Mr. Gilroy.\nQ. Why?\u2014A. For a half interest in his\u2014what is it?\nHis LORDSHIP: For a half interest in what?\u2014A. Tire wasn\u2019t it?\nMr. BULLEN: For a half interest in a patent to make a tire was it?\u2014A. A tire, yes.\nQ. How much was it, how much did you pay for it?\u2014A. $7,500.\nQ. And you paid how much in cash at the time you made the agreement?\u2014A. It was $3,000.\n* * * * *\nCROSS-EXAMINED BY MR. ROBERTSON:\nQ. You gave the note to Mr. Gilroy made payable to the Travellers\u2019 Rubber Company in order that Gilroy should pay the debt he owed that company, you knew that?\u2014A. I did not know anything about it.\nIn answer to a question by His Lordship, Gilroy admitted that the body of the note was in his handwriting.\nIn his judgment, the learned trial judge said:\u2014\nThe defendant Gilroy owed the T.R. Co. a considerable sum for the right to use a certain patent\u2014he was owed by the defendant Murphy a considerable sum as balance of purchase price of a share in his venture.\n* * * * *\nWhen this note was given, the purchase by Murphy of a share in Gilroy\u2019s venture had been completed, but Murphy owed a certain part of the purchase money as an ordinary debt\u2014nevertheless the original consideration was the interest in Gilroy\u2019s venture. I do not think that the right to manufacture under a patent is an interest in a patent, and a fortiori a right to share in the exercise by another of a right to manufacture under the patent cannot fairly be said to be an interest in the patent itself\u2014within the meaning of the statute. This, in my opinion, is a clear finding that Murphy gave the note in part payment of the interest which he had purchased from Gilroy. That interest the learned trial judge thought was a share in Gilroy\u2019s \u201cventure,\u201d meaning, as I understand his language, in the manufacture of tubes under patent no. 230,027. This, I think, was a misconception, as Murphy had purchased no interest in the manufacturing venture, his purchase was a half interest in the tire patent. On the evidence of Gilroy and Murphy, which the learned trial judge accepted, and on the finding, it seems to me impossible to reach any other conclusion than that Murphy gave the note sued on to Gilroy in part payment of the purchase price of a half interest in the tire patent.\nSection 14 of the Bills of Exchange Act reads as follows:\u2014\n14. Every bill or note the consideration of which consists, in whole or in part, of the purchase money of a patent right, or of a partial interest, limited geographically or otherwise, in a patent right, shall have written or printed prominently and legibly across the face thereof, before the same is issued, the words Given for a patent right.\n2. Without such words thereon, such instrument and any renewal thereof shall be void, except in the hands of a holder in due course without notice of such consideration.\nThe plaintiff was not a holder in due course, as he took the note after maturity and with knowledge that Murphy claimed that it was given for an interest in a patent right. The note not having the words \u201cgiven for a patent right\u201d written or printed thereon, is therefore void. Craig v. M. & L. Samuel, Benjamin & Co.[16]\nIt was, however, argued that as the note was made payable to the company to whom Murphy was not indebted it must be deemed to be an accommodation note and Murphy must be deemed to be an accommodation party within the meaning of s. 55 of the Act. That section reads as follows:\u2014\n55. An accommodation party to a bill is a person who has signed a bill as drawer, acceptor or endorser, without receiving value therefor, and for the purpose of lending his name to some other person.\nIt was admitted by counsel for the appellant that it was only as an accommodation maker that Murphy could be held liable on the note. To be an accommodation maker Murphy must not have received any consideration therefor and he must have signed it for the purpose of lending his name to Gilroy. Now it may well be said that Murphy received no consideration from the company, but can it be said that he gave the note for the purpose of lending his name to Gilroy? In my opinion it can not. Both he and Gilroy have sworn to the contrary and their evidence has not been contradicted. The only ground upon which the contention that the note was made for Gilroy\u2019s accommodation can be based is that the company\u2019s name appears therein as payee. This fact, it is said, supports an inference that Murphy in giving the note was lending his name to Gilroy. The probative force to be given to this inference is not, in my opinion, sufficient to override the positive testimony of Murphy and Gilroy that the note was given as a payment on account of an interest in the patent right. The cross-examination of these witnesses as to why the company\u2019s name was inserted as payee was most meagre. Practically all the information we have is that Gilroy drew up the note in that form and that Murphy signed it; but Murphy has testified that when he signed it he did not know that Gilroy intended to use it to pay a debt of his own to the company. Counsel for the appellant urged that Murphy had been put forward to the appellant and to the company as maker of a note for Gilroy\u2019s accommodation, and reference was made to the evidence of Gilroy in which he testified to a conversation he had with the appellant in which he told the appellant, who was pressing him for payment of the royalties, that he had a friend from whom he might get a note. In answer to this contention it is sufficient to point out that in his testimony the appellant swore positively that no such conversation had ever taken place and that he had never suggested the obtaining of a note by Gilroy. Whether the appellant or the company thought they were getting an accommodation note is, in my opinion, immaterial. They are presumed to know the law and to know that if the note handed to the appellant by Gilroy was in fact given as part payment of an interest in a patent right, the same was void under s. 14, above quoted.\nIt was argued that Murphy in his pleadings set up that the note was an accommodation note. It does so appear, but whoever drafted his statement of defence evidently set up every defence he could think of. The plea, however, on which Murphy relies is clearly set out in paragraph 9, and reads as follows:\u2014\n9. The defendant, J.E. Murphy, claims that the note sued upon is void, because to the knowledge of the plaintiff it was given for an interest in a patent right without having endorsed thereon the words \u201cgiven for a patent right.\u201d\nThen it is said that the testimony of Gilroy and Murphy should not be believed because, on his examination for discovery, Gilroy stated that he had never discussed with Murphy the question of an interest in the patent right. This Gilroy explains, and I think reasonably, by pointing out that his answer was absolutely true as regards the tube patent, which was the patent under discussion in the examination.\nIt was also pointed out that Gilroy had stated that at the time he obtained the note in question no mention was made of its being for an interest in a patent right. Why should such mention be made? The patent right had been discussed at the time Murphy bought his half interest. When the note was taken there was no occasion for discussing it, the interest had been purchased and the note was merely payment on account.\nOur attention was also called to the fact that in a former proceeding Murphy had made an affidavit that the note had been given by him for accommodation only. This affidavit was not in evidence at the trial and it comes before us only by the consent of Murphy\u2019s counsel that it might be filed and read. I am at a loss to understand why such consent should be given in the absence of any explanation by Murphy as to how he came to make the affidavit or as to what he understood by making a note for accommodation only. The affidavit not being before the trial court, Murphy, of course, was not asked to explain how he came to make it or what he understood by it. As the trial judge found Murphy\u2019s evidence given in court to be credible, I do not think the affidavit can be held to be conclusive against him in the absence of any opportunity on his part to explain it.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Fasken, Robertson, Atchison, Pickup & Calvin.\nSolicitors for the respondent Murphy: Clark & Brant.\nSolicitor for the respondent Gilroy: W.A.

Ils ach\u00e8teront \u00e9galement au comptant et en lots \u00e0 leur convenance le livre \u201cLa Sant\u00e9\u201d publi\u00e9 par l\u2019appelant, et cela aux prix mentionn\u00e9s dans la m\u00eame lettre. Enfin, ils s\u2019engagent \u00e0 d\u00e9penser en publicit\u00e9, annonces, etc., au moins $1,000 par ann\u00e9e, \u00e0 commencer un an apr\u00e8s la signature du contrat.\nDe son c\u00f4t\u00e9, rappelant nomme les intim\u00e9s ses agents, repr\u00e9sentants et d\u00e9positaires exclusifs pour la vente de ses produits pour tout le Canada et les Etats-Unis, durant vingt ann\u00e9es \u00e0 compter de la signature du contrat. Il les autorise \u00e0 faire enregistrer au Canada et aux Etats-Unis le livre \u201cLa Sant\u00e9\u201d, \u00e0 en faire publier une traduction anglaise, et \u00e0 se servir pour toutes fins commerciales et enregistrer comme raison sociale le nom \u201cLes Warr\u00e9cures-Canada\u201d, de m\u00eame que le mot \u201cWarr\u00e9cures\u201d pour toutes autres fins de publicit\u00e9.\nQuelques mois plus tard l\u2019appelant r\u00e9voqua le contrat qu\u2019il avait avec les intim\u00e9s. Puis il intenta contre eux la pr\u00e9sente action, o\u00f9 il demanda l\u2019annulation du contrat, all\u00e9guant que les intim\u00e9s n\u2019en avaient pas rempli les obligations, notamment quant au paiement au comptant du montant de leurs commandes de marchandises.\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure ne s\u2019est pas prononc\u00e9e sur les griefs invoqu\u00e9s par l\u2019appelant contre les intim\u00e9s, mais envisageant le contrat comme un mandat r\u00e9vocable au gr\u00e9 du mandant aux termes de l\u2019article 1756 C.C., elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la r\u00e9vocation de l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait effective et, pour ce seul motif, elle a maintenu l\u2019action.\nLa Cour du Banc du Roi a infirm\u00e9 ce jugement. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019avis que l\u2019article 1756 C.C. ne s\u2019applique pas \u00e0 un tel contrat qui est synallagmatique de sa nature et fait pour l\u2019avantage des deux parties. Elle a trouv\u00e9 mal fond\u00e9s les griefs que l\u2019appelant invoque, et elle a renvoy\u00e9 son action.\nL\u2019appelant se pourvoit maintenant devant nous en appel de ce jugement.\nLe jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi nous para\u00eet enti\u00e8rement bien fond\u00e9. Le contrat en question est d\u2019un type bien connu en ce pays. Il comporte le droit exclusif, dans le Canada et les Etats-Unis, de vendre les produits de l\u2019appelant que les intim\u00e9s doivent acheter de lui en quantit\u00e9s repr\u00e9sentant au moins 1,000 francs la commande. Les marchandises que les intim\u00e9s ach\u00e8tent et qu\u2019ils paient comptant avant l\u2019exp\u00e9dition leur appartiennent. Ils les vendent comme ils le veulent et n\u2019en sont pas comptables envers l\u2019appelant. La clause qui les nomme les agents et repr\u00e9sentants de ce dernier, n\u2019est un mandat que de nom, car les intim\u00e9s ne g\u00e8rent aucune affaire pour l\u2019appelant (art. 1701 C.C., d\u00e9finition du mandat), et malgr\u00e9 que la clause dise que les intim\u00e9s sont les agents de l\u2019Abb\u00e9 Warr\u00e9 pour la vente de ses produits, ils ne peuvent obtenir ces produits qu\u2019en les payant d\u2019avance, et alors c\u2019est leur propre marchandise qu\u2019ils vendent. M\u00eame si on envisageait cette clause comme contenant un v\u00e9ritable mandat, ce mandat serait une stipulation accessoire ou une condition d\u2019un contrat synallagmatique entre l\u2019appelant et les intim\u00e9s, et partant serait irr\u00e9vocable par le mandant seul (Aubry et Rau, 5 \u00e9d., t. 6, 185). Le droit de r\u00e9vocation que la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure reconna\u00eet \u00e0 l\u2019appelant n\u2019existe donc pas dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, et l\u2019article 1756 C.C. est hors de cause.\nNous sommes \u00e9galement d\u2019avis que l\u2019appelant n\u2019a prouv\u00e9 aucune inex\u00e9cution par les intim\u00e9s de leurs obligations contractuelles.

Mooney and Others (Defendants) Respondents,\n1929: February 7; 1929: March 20.\nPresent: Duff, Mignault, Newcombe, Lamont and Smith JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING\u2019S BENCH, SASKATCHEWAN\nWill\u2014Construction, as to beneficiaries\u2014Share of person predeceasing testator to go to such person\u2019s \u201cchildren\u201d\u2014Adopted child\u2014Effect of foreign law declaring rights of child adopted under that law.\nA testator, who died April 17, 1922, domiciled in Saskatchewan, by his will provided for division of part of his estate equally among seven persons, including S., and directed that \u201cshould any of the parties mentioned * * * predecease me, the share which such party would have received had he or she survived me is to be divided equally between the children of the party who would have received said share.\u201d S., who was domiciled in the State of Washington, predeceased the testator, leaving only a child whom he and his wife had adopted under the laws of Washington, by which laws such child is declared to be to all intents and purposes the child and legal heir of his adopter, entitled to all rights and privileges and subject to all the obligations of a child of the adopter begotten in lawful wedlock.\nHeld: The child did not take under the will. No principle was applicable from the rule applied to determine the legitimacy of children born before their parents\u2019 marriage. The question was not one of status, but was whether the adopted child was a person such as described in the bequest. There being nothing in the will or the circumstances to indicate its use otherwise than in its ordinary sense, the word \u201cchildren\u201d (under Saskatchewan law as it stood at the time in question) did not include an adopted child[1].\nJudgment of Bigelow J. (23 Sask. L.R. 111; appealed from per saltum) affirmed.\nAPPEAL (per saltum, by leave of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[2]) from the judgment of Bigelow J.[3] dismissing the appellant\u2019s (plaintiff\u2019s) application, made by way of originating notice, in the Court of King\u2019s Bench, Saskatchewan, for an order directing the executors of the will of the late Peter Donald, deceased, to pay to the appellant, as guardian of the estate of James W. Speedie, an infant, all moneys at the commencement of the proceedings or thereafter during the minority of said James W. Speedie payable to him out of said deceased\u2019s estate.\nThe following facts were, for the purpose of the appeal, admitted by the parties:\n1. [Nature of the proceedings, as above set out].\n2. The said Peter Donald died on April 17, 1922, domiciled in the province of Saskatchewan, having made his last will and testament bearing date April 26, 1920, letters probate whereof were granted to the respondent executors out of the Surrogate Court, Judicial District of Kindersley, in the province of Saskatchewan, on August 12, 1922.\n3. The said Peter Donald by his said will directed his executors to divide one-twelfth of the residue of his estate excepting one section of land equally share and share alike among seven persons, one of whom was Andrew Speedie, of Seattle, Washington, U.S.A.\n4. The said Andrew Speedie died on August 20, 1920, domiciled in the State of Washington, U.S.A.\n5. That the said Peter Donald, deceased, by his will provided as follows:\nShould any of the parties mentioned in this my will, except the said Margaret Fleming, predecease me, the share which such party would have received had he or she survived me is to be divided equally between the children of the party who would have received said share.\n6. That at the commencement of these proceedings the estate of said Peter Donald, deceased, had been partially distributed and that the share of the portion distributed which the said Andrew Speedie would have received had he survived the testator was at the commencement of these proceedings approximately $980, which sum is held in reserve by the respondent executors, and that the value of the estate of said deceased undistributed at the commencement of these proceedings was approximately $332,000.\n7. That the said Andrew Speedie died leaving surviving him James W. Speedie, an adopted child, adopted under the laws of the State of Washington, U.S.A., who was born on May 2, 1909, and no other child or children. 8. That the appellant is guardian of the person and estate of said James W. Speedie under letters guardianship issued out of the Superior Court of the State of Washington on October 18, 1927.\n9. That the said James W. Speedie was adopted by the said Andrew Speedie and his wife the appellant (then named Mary E. Speedie) as their son in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington and that the order of adoption under such laws was made on June 15, 1914, in the Superior Court of the State of Washington. The said order provides as follows:\nIt is hereby ordered that the said minor child be adopted by said petitioners and from this day he is to all intents and purposes the child of the petitioners Andrew Speedie and Mary E. Speedie and that his name be changed to James Waterbury Speedie.\n10. That at the time of said adoption the said Andrew Speedie and James W. Speedie were and the said James W. Speedie still is domiciled in the State of Washington, U.S.A.\n11. That the said Order of adoption was made pursuant to section 1698 of Remington\u2019s Compiled Statutes of Washington, which section is as follows:\nUpon the compliance with the foregoing provisions, if the court shall be satisfied of the ability of the petitioner or petitioners to bring up and educate the child properly, having reference to the degree and condition of the child\u2019s parents, and shall be satisfied of the fitness and propriety of such adoption, the court shall make an order setting forth the facts and declaring that from that date such child, to all legal intents and purposes, is the child of the petitioner or petitioners, and that the name of the child is hereby changed.\n12. That the effect of the said order of adoption according to the laws of the State of Washington is as set forth in section 1699 of the said Compiled Statutes, which section is as follows:\nBy such order the natural parents shall be divested of all legal rights and obligations in respect to such child, and the child shall be free from all legal obligations of obedience and maintenance in respect to them, and shall be, to all intents and purposes, the child and legal heir of his or her adopter or adopters, entitled to all rights and privileges and subject to all the obligations of a child of the adopter or adopters begotten in lawful wedlock: Provided, that on the decease of parents who have adopted a child or children under this chapter and the subsequent decease of such child or children without issue, the property of such adopting parents shall descend to their next of kin, and not to the next of kin of such adopted child or children.\n13. That the said sections 1698 and 1699 were in force on and for some time prior to June 15, 1914, and are now in full force and effect as laws of the said State of Washington.\n14. That under the laws of the State of Washington the guardian of an infant domiciled and resident therein and appointed by the courts of such State has power to receive and give legal discharges for all moneys payable to such infant whether the same be payable by persons residing within or beyond the said State and that under the laws of said State it is the duty of such a guardian to collect all debts and demands due to his ward.\nBigelow J.[4], following Burnfiel v. Burnfiel[5], which he held was applicable and binding upon him, held that the said James W. Speedie did not take under the will as a \u201cchild\u201d of the said Andrew Speedie.\nG. W. Forbes for the appellant.\nAvery Casey K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nSmith J.\u2014Peter Donald died domiciled in Saskatchewan on 17th April, 1922, having made his will dated 26th April, 1920, which was duly probated in Saskatchewan.\nBy this will the testator directed his executors to divide one-twelfth of the residue of his estate, excepting one section of land, equally among seven persons, one of whom was Andrew Speedie, of Seattle, Washington, U.S.A. Another clause of the will provided as follows:\nShould any of the parties mentioned in this my Will, except the said Margaret Fleming, predecease me, the share which such party would have received had he or she survived me is to be divided equally between the children of the party who would have received said share.\nAndrew Speedie died on the 20th day of. August, 1920, leaving surviving him James W. Speedie, adopted as a child under the laws of the State of Washington, but no other child. The statute of this State authorizes the court, upon compliance with its provisions, to make an order declaring that from and after that date such child, to all legal intents and purposes, is the child of the petitioner or petitioners, and such an order was made, declaring the child James W. Speedie to be the child of said Andrew Speedie and his wife Mary E. Speedie. The statute declares that by such order the child shall be,\nto all intents and purposes, the child and legal heir of his or her adopter or adopters, entitled to all rights and privileges and subject to all the obligations of a child of the adopter or adopters begotten in lawful wedlock.\nAndrew Speedie having died before the testator, the question is: Does the adopted child James W. Speedie, under the clause of the will quoted above, take the share that Andrew Speedie would have taken had he survived the testator? The appellant, as guardian of the infant James W. Speedie, on an originating notice in chambers applied to the Court of King\u2019s Bench in the Judicial District of Regina for an order directing the executors to pay to her as such guardian the moneys payable to the infant in respect of the share of Andrew Speedie, which motion was dismissed on the ground that the infant James W. Speedie was not entitled to the share bequeathed to Andrew Speedie as his child under the clause quoted.\nBy reason of conflicting decisions in the various provinces on the point in question, an appeal from the order in chambers is taken direct to this Court by leave obtained from the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan.\nThe appellant submits that the principle adopted in the English cases cited, in reference to children made legitimate according to the law of the domicile of the father, applies to children adopted as in this case. It is admitted that there is no direct authority for this proposition in this court, nor in English decisions, but four cases decided in our provincial courts are cited, viz.: Re Throssel[6]; Robertson v. Ives[7]; Purcell v. Hendricks[8]; In Re McAdam[9]. These cases are at variance with the decision of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan in Burnfiel v. Burnfiel[10].\nThe law in relation to the status of a child by legitimation is reviewed in In re Andros[11]. The following are extracts from the judgment by Kay J.: This will being an English will must, of course, be construed according to English law. That law requires that all who take under a gift to sons of a named father should be legitimate offspring.\n* * * * *\nA bequest in an English will to the children of A. means to his legitimate children, but the rule of construction goes no further. The question remains who are his legitimate children. That certainly is not a question of construction of the will. It is a question of status. By what law is that status to be determined. That is a question of law. Does that comity of nations which we call international law apply to the case or not?\nHe reviews the cases, and concludes that, owing to the conflict of authority, he must decide the matter for himself, and holds that a bequest of personality in an English will to the children of a foreigner means to his legitimate children and that by international law, as recognized in this country, those children are legitimate whose legitimacy is established by the law of the father\u2019s domicile. In the case before him, an English will bequeathed property to the sons of T. E. Andros, who died domiciled in Guernsey. The plaintiff was a son of T. E. Andros, born in Guernsey in 1860, before his marriage there to plaintiff\u2019s mother, which was in 1865. The subsequent marriage of his parents legitimated the plaintiff under the law of Guernsey. Applying the rule laid down, it was held that the plaintiff was to be deemed a legitimate child under the terms of the will and entitled to take. The rule, however, as stated is wider than the decision, and has been finally settled in more restricted form. Dicey\u2019s Conflict of Laws, 4th ed., at p. 903, states the rule in terms, which the author says may now be laid down with confidence, as follows:\nOur Courts hold that under the common law the question of a child\u2019s legitimacy is to be determined by the law of the father\u2019s domicil at the time of the child\u2019s birth, taken together with the law of the father\u2019s domicil at the time of the subsequent marriage of the child\u2019s parents, and, when a person is legitimated under these two laws, fully admit his legitimacy.\nThis rule, first applied in case of a bequest of personality, was applied to a devise of real estate in In re Gray\u2019s Trusts[12], but it was held in Birtwhistle v. Vardill[13], that it does not apply to inheritance of real estate.\nIt is the principle of the rule quoted above that, it is argued, applies here to the case of this adopted child. It will be noted that the rule does not apply to all illegitimate children legitimated by the law of the domicile, but only to those born in the domicile and legitimated by subsequent marriage of the parents in that domicile, as is illustrated by In re Goodman\u2019s Trusts[14].\nD., an unmarried woman domiciled in England, died intestate, leaving as her sole next of kin the children of two deceased brothers, one of whom had by Charlotte Smith three illegitimate children born in England. In 1870 he changed his domicile to Holland, where he had another illegitimate child by the same woman. He subsequently married this woman in Holland, whereby, under the law of that country, all these children became legitimate. It was held that the child born in Holland before the marriage was to be deemed legitimate and entitled to take as next of kin, but that those born in England were not next of kin.\nIt seems clear that there is no principle in the rule referred to that can be applied to an adopted child. The limitation as to parents marrying in the country of domicile can have no application in such case, and it was not suggested that the adopted child must be born in the domicile of the party adopting.\nThe bequest in this case is to \u201cthe children\u201d of Andrew Speedie, and there is nothing in the will or the circumstances to indicate that these words \u201cthe children\u201d were used otherwise than in their ordinary sense. The judgment in In re Andros[15], as stated above, lays it down-that \u201cEnglish law (which is Saskatchewan law) requires that all who take under a gift to sons of a named father should be legitimate offspring.\u201d\nSaskatchewan law therefore requires that the parties who take under this bequest to the children of Andrew Speedie shall be the legitimate offspring of Andrew Speedie, and the simple question is, does this adopted child come within that description? It seems perfectly clear that he does not, for the reason that he is not in fact the offspring of Andrew Speedie. It is not a question of status, but a question of whether this adopted child is a person such as mentioned and described in this bequest.\nIt is, of course, quite possible that the word \u201cchildren,\u201d as used in a will, may include adopted children or illegitimate children where the language of the will, coupled with the circumstances, indicates that the testator used the word in that sense, but there is nothing of that kind in this case.\nThe appeal must be dismissed.\nIn view of the decisions in the courts of three provinces being in conflict with the decision of the courts in Saskatchewan on the point in question, the appellant was not unreasonable in submitting her rights to the court, and in bringing them directly, as has been done, to this court. The costs, therefore, of the appeal and of the proceedings below of all parties as between solicitor and client will be out of the estate.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Cross, Jonah, Hugg & Forbes.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Casey, Dawson & Co.\n[1] Reporter\u2019s Note:\u2014The Adoption of Children Act, 1922 (Sask., 1921-22, c. 64.

Between the railway and the main travelled road there was a ditch. The ties and rails were above the ground level. There were built up crossings across the ditch and railway. Plaintiff was driving along the road after dark on January 2, 1926, when his horses ran away. They turned over one of said crossings on to the prairie, made a circuit and came back to the crossing and turned and ran along the railway where they were, further on, overtaken and struck by defendants tramcar, the motor-man, who was going at 30 miles an hour, not having seen them in time to stop before hitting them. Plaintiff sued for damages. The headlights used on defendant\u2019s cars were the standard equipment of similar cars on this continent. But the motorman testified that he had had trouble on his trip that evening from Winnipeg to Selkirk with dimness of the light; he had changed the carbon at Selkirk, but still had trouble with dimness on the trip back to Winnipeg, on which the accident happened; when the light was working with full efficiency he could see about seven \u201cpole lengths\u201d ahead; he had made emergency stops in about three pole lengths; he did not see plaintiff\u2019s outfit until he was about one pole length away. Evidence was given that after the accident the light was tested and found in good condition. An expert testified that in all arc lights there is a variation in brightness, due to automatic adjustment in the carbon, causing momentary dimness, and to the light being affected by line voltage. The jury found defendant negligent in \u201cnot having any man on duty at Selkirk capable of making adjustments to the lights or other equipment to the car before leaving Selkirk on the night of the accident\u201d; but this finding being deemed unsatisfactory in view of the pleadings, the jury, after further directions, added: \u201cas the evidence submitted shows the headlight was not sufficiently powerful to illuminate the track for the motorman to see an object far enough ahead to avoid the accident.\u201d Plaintiff recovered judgment, which was sustained by the Court of Appeal (37 Man. R. 320).\nHeld (Anglin C.J.C. and Lamont J. dissenting): The judgment below should be reversed, and the action dismissed.\nPer Newcombe and Smith JJ.: Defendant had no obligation to keep a man on duty at Selkirk; moreover, plaintiff had not alleged failure to do so as a ground of negligence. As to the added clause, it did not, in view of the evidence and the judge\u2019s charge, imply a finding of excessive speed; nor did it imply that the headlight in question had some particular defect causing it to function less effectively than defendant\u2019s headlights ordinarily functioned\u2014there was no evidence on which a jury could reasonably so find, and they had not found any such defect in terms; the only negligence found was failure in a duty which, in the jury\u2019s opinion, as indicated by their finding, was on defendant, to have a headlight sufficiently powerful to enable the motor-man to see plaintiff in time to stop before hitting him; and defendant\u2019s duty in law did not go that far; it was bound to operate its cars with the care that a reasonably prudent person would exercise under the circumstances; in view of the position and construction of the railway it had no reason to anticipate that a person might be going along on the railway with his team; and it was not bound to use such a degree of care as to insure against accident under such extraordinary circumstances as had placed the plaintiff in such a situation. Its duty to use reasonable care required it to have a headlight of reasonable efficiency, having regard to the state of the art, and such duty was complied with.\nPer Rinfret J.: The added clause indicated no intention of introducing a new and independent finding of negligence; it left the verdict as it stood formerly, except that it disclosed the reason for the original answer. It did not improve the unsatisfactory finding. But, looking upon it as a separate finding of negligence\u2014if it meant that defendant was under the duty to have on its cars headlights of sufficient power to illuminate the track so as, under all circumstances, to avoid an accident, the verdict was without legal grounds to maintain it; if it meant that the headlight on this particular car was insufficient, the answer was twofold: (1) the uncontradicted evidence was that it was the best type of light to be found; (2) there was no evidence that the headlight was out of order. The dimness which, for some reason not explained, temporarily existed, and which was not common to the type nor due to any defect in the particular light, might have been a reason for finding the motorman at fault in driving at that rate of speed under the circumstances; but that was not the finding; moreover, the question of speed had been withdrawn from the jury. In view of the position and construction of the railway, defendant could not reasonably be held to have been bound to anticipate what occurred. Per Anglin C.J.C. and Lamont J. (dissenting): The jury found, in effect, that, under the circumstances, defendant was negligent in not having on the car a headlight functioning with sufficient power to enable the motorman to see objects on the track in time to stop before hitting them. Whether defendant\u2019s common law duty to exercise \u201cthat care which a reasonably prudent man would exercise under the circumstances\u201d was complied with, was a question of fact; and there was evidence to justify the jury in finding that it was not complied with; that the particular headlight in question was inadequate, considering the hour, place, and speed of the car. Plaintiff had a right to be on the track (having regard to the relevant statutes and the agreement between defendant and the municipalities through which its line ran), subject only to obligation to give right of way. Defendant had reason to anticipate that the public might go on its track. The supplying by defendant to its cars of headlights of such power, when at full efficiency, as it did supply, was most cogent evidence against it as to what a proper headlight should do, and this standard of care established by defendant itself might well have been taken by the jury to be that which a reasonably prudent man would have adopted under the circumstances. Also, the statutory requirement to \u201cprovide adequate equipment\u201d for the \u201cefficient working and operation of the railway\u201d would include an effective headlight. The jury\u2019s finding that the headlight would not illuminate the track far enough ahead for safety, was sufficient, without a finding of any particular defect. Also, it could not be said that defendant discharged its full duty by equipping the car with a standard headlight, if that headlight, for some reason or other, did not function; its duty was to supply at adequately functioning headlight. (Anglin C.J.C. held also that, should the jury\u2019s finding be deemed insufficient to support a judgment for plaintiff, there should be a new trial, because of misdirection on the issue of excessive speed and insufficiency of a question put to the jury).\nAPPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1] dismissing its appeal from the judgment ordered by Curran J. to be entered, upon the verdict of a jury, for the plaintiff for the sum of $2,354.25 and costs. The action was for damages for personal injuries to the plaintiff and damage to his property caused by the defendant\u2019s street car colliding with the plaintiff\u2019s sleigh through, as alleged, the defendant\u2019s negligence.\nThe material facts of the case are sufficiently stated and discussed in the judgments now reported, particularly in the judgments delivered\u2019 by Lamont J. and Smith J., and are indicated in the above headnote. The questions put to the jury and the answers thereto are set out in the judgment of Smith J. The defendant\u2019s appeal to this Court was allowed with costs here and in the Court of Appeal, and the action dismissed with costs. Anglin C. J.C. and Lamont J. dissented.\nW. N. Tilley K.C. for the appellant.\nD. Campbell K.C. for the respondent.\nAnglin C.J.C. (dissenting).\u2014I have had the advantage of reading the opinions prepared by my brothers Lamont and Smith. While fully concurring in the conclusions of the former and in the reasoning on which they are based, there are a few observations which it seems to me desirable that I should make.\nThe ditch alongside the tramway and the unlawful height of the tracks\u2014six or eight inches above the highway level\u2014were much relied on by the appellant as affording strong ground for supposing that there would not be vehicular traffic along the tramway rails. At other seasons that might be the case. But we are here in the presence of midwinter conditions (January 2nd), when, normally, the line of demarcation would almost disappear, and no serious obstacle would be presented to the driving of a team of horses and a sleigh on to, and along, the part of the highway on which the tramway is laid. This bears on the question whether there was any reason for the company to anticipate that there might be vehicular traffic on that part of the highway.\nThe jury\u2019s answer to the sixth question indicates their purpose to hold the motorman, McLeod, blameless. They probably accepted his statement that he was obliged to make schedule time and that this required him to run his car at thirty miles an hour or upwards. Otherwise they might well have found him at fault, notwithstanding the misdirection of the trial judge on that question, in driving at that rate of speed while his headlight was, for one reason or another, functioning so poorly that he could not distinguish objects on the track more than seventy feet ahead.\nIn the light of McLeod\u2019s evidence, the finding of the jury in answer to the second question means that, the motorman being required to maintain a speed of not less than thirty miles per hour, the duty of the company was to provide him with a headlight which would always enable him to discern objects on the track at least 420 feet ahead, that being the shortest distance within which his car running at that speed could be stopped; and that it was negligence to fail to furnish such a headlight\u2014from whatever cause, whether inherent defect, loose connections, or lack of power, it failed so to function. The only alternative, on the evidence which the jury seems to have accepted, would be a finding of fault, amounting to recklessness, on the part of the motorman in maintaining, under the circumstances, the speed he did.\nBut if, for any reason, the jury\u2019s finding in answer to the second question should be deemed insufficient to support a judgment for the plaintiff, a new trial would, I fear, be inevitable, because of misdirection on the issue of excessive speed and also because of the insufficiency of the sixth question and of the direction in regard to it. That question should have read as follows:\u2014\nMight the defendant\u2019s servants, after the position of the plaintiff became apparent (or should have been apparent to the motorman), by the exercise of reasonable care have prevented the accident?\nThe part in brackets was omitted, and the charge of the learned trial judge did not remedy the deficiency. No doubt the motorman, as the jury found, did all he could after the position of the plaintiff was apparent, i.e., when he was about sixty feet ahead; but it was then too late. Had the part of the question (as above stated) in brackets been included, who can say that the jury, properly instructed, would not have found that the motorman should have seen the plaintiff\u2019s danger when he was over 500 feet away, and should in that case have stopped his car in time to avoid running him down? Such a finding would entail liability of the defendants; and the jury were not given the opportunity to make it.\nFinally, the case of Brenner v. Toronto Railway Co.[2], referred to by my brother Smith, and part of the judgment of the Divisional Court in which was approved by the Judicial Committee in British Columbia Electric Ry. Co. Ltd. v. Loach[3], was alluded to in the course of the argument only because the judgment in the Divisional Court had followed an earlier decision in Preston v. Toronto Ry. Co.[4], where it was held that a rule (or practice) of the railway company concerning the safety of persons using the streets affords evidence, as against the company, of a standard of reasonableness in regard to the subject covered by it upon which a jury may act. The Brenner case[5] has no other bearing upon the matter now before us.\nI am unable to understand why, having regard to the conditions under which the appellant\u2019s tramcars are operated, a headlight functioning effectively should not be deemed part of the \u201cadequate equipment\u201d which \u201cevery railway company\u201d is required by the Manitoba Railway Act (s. 40) \u201cat all times\u201d to provide \u201cfor the efficient working and operation of the railway.\u201d If it is, there was here a breach of statutory duty by the defendants which the jury has found to have been negligence causing the injuries of which the plaintiff complains. If not, then to cause a heavy tramcar to rush along a dark highway, where it has not an exclusive, but merely a preferential, right-of-way, at 30 miles per hour, with a headlight functioning so ineffectively that it only enables the motorman to see objects 60 or 70 feet ahead, instead of at a distance of 800-1,000 feet, as a headlight functioning at full efficiency would enable him to do, imports a reckless indifference to the rights of others and a criminal disregard of the safety of those who may be on such highway utterly inconsistent with the duty \u201cto operate their cars with the care that a reasonably prudent person would exercise under the circumstances,\u201d which, it is common ground, the common law imposed upon the defendants.\nIn setting up, in explanation of their failure to have an adequate headlight, the improbability of there being any vehicular traffic on the tramway tracks because of their excessive height above the highway, the defendants are, in effect, invoking a consequence of their own illegality to excuse the non-observance of what would otherwise have been their plain duty.\nNewcombe J. concurs with Smith J.\nRinfret J.\u2014I do not think the verdict can stand.\nThe first answer of the jury was that the company was at fault for \u201cnot having any man on duty at Selkirk capable of making adjustments to the lights or other equipment to the car before leaving Selkirk on the night of the accident.\u201d This was considered unsatisfactory by the trial judge and counsel on both sides. All seemed to agree that, more particularly in view of the pleadings and the course of the trial, no judgment could be entered on such ground. The jury were accordingly requested to reconsider their answer. They did not change it; they only added to it the following words: \u201cas the evidence submitted shows the headlight was not sufficiently powerful to illuminate the track for the motorman to see an object far enough ahead to avoid the accident.\u201d The wording of this additional answer indicated, on the part of the jury, no intention of introducing a new and independent finding of negligence against the company. It left the verdict as it stood formerly, except that it disclosed the reason for the original answer. It did not improve the unsatisfactory finding.\nShould we, however, look upon the additional answer as a separate finding of negligence, the difficulty is to understand its true meaning. If the meaning be that the railway company was under the duty to have on its cars headlights of sufficient power to illuminate the track so as, under all circumstances, to avoid an accident, I do not see upon what legal grounds such verdict can be maintained.\nIf the meaning be that the headlight on this particular car was insufficient, the answer is two-fold:\u2014\n1. The uncontradicted evidence is that it is the best type of light that can be found. It is in use on 90% of the lines on the North American continent. At full efficiency, it will show an object about 700 feet ahead, which is far more than what would be required to meet the duty of the company, even if we should accept the standard laid down by the jury according to the widest interpretation that can be given to its verdict.\n2. There is no evidence that the headlight was out of order. During the previous trip from Selkirk to Winnipeg, the dimmer was used and gave no trouble. Coming back from Winnipeg to Selkirk, \u201cthe bull\u2019s eye * * * was working good.\u201d Tests were made daily. One was made on this particular headlight before it was put on the car. After the accident, the headlight was again tested, when it was brought back to Selkirk, and found in good condition. So that the charge of negligence against the company:\n5b. In failing to supply and maintain sufficient and adequate lights to enable the motorman to see the plaintiff in time to stop.\nwas without foundation.\nThe headlight which the company supplied and maintained was sufficiently powerful to meet the exigencies of the jury, even if such duty was cast upon the company.\nTrue it is that, in the course of operation, for some time previous to the accident, and for some reason not satisfactorily explained, the lamp flickered and the light became dim. That was not common to that type of headlight, nor due to any defect in the particular light then in use. It was a temporary condition unknown to any official, agent or employee of the company, outside of the motorman. It might have been a reason for the jury to find the motor-man at fault in driving at that rate of speed under the circumstances. But that is not what the jury found. On that point, moreover, it should not be overlooked that the question of speed had been withdrawn from them by the trial judge, who told them that they should disregard it altogether.\nThat the motorman was held blameless is not inconsistent with the view that he could not anticipate such an unusual occurrence as the finding of a team and sleigh on this railway, constructed as it was with ties and rails above the ground level, ando separated from the travelled highway by a \u201cwide road ditch.\u201d\nIt may be that the special Act of incorporation of the company did not authorize the railway to be so constructed. But the jury were faced with the conditions as they were. The trial judge, in his address, had said to them:\nThere is no doubt about it that the railway was properly and legally constructed.\nIt seems evident that, wrongly or rightly, the company had taken unto itself the exclusive use of its right of way. The wide ditch and the other circumstances favoured this course of action. The public appears to have assented to it. It did not, in fact, travel upon the right of way. Any vehicular traffic over it was out of the question, on account of the lay-out, of the ties and of the protruding rails. The railway had been thus in operation for a good many years. The plaintiff himself did not contend that, at the time of the accident, he happened to be on the right of way in the exercise of a right. He took pains to explain that he was driven there through a course of events absolutely beyond his control. No doubt he was found guilty of no contributory negligence; but the evidence was that the horses became unmanageable and that fact would be a sufficient explanation of that part of the verdict.\nIn my view of the case, that point is not concluded by the statutes and the Act of incorporation. It has to be considered in the light of the actual facts and the existing conditions and that was a matter essentially for the jury. I do not think, upon the answers, the plaintiff was entitled to a judgment in his favour.\nI would allow the appeal and would concur in the dismissal of the action.\nLamont J. (dissenting)\u2014In this case the facts are as follows:\u2014\nOn January 2, 1926, the respondent (plaintiff) who is a farmer, left Winnipeg for his home, about sixteen miles north, with a team and sleigh. He had proceeded along the highway some twelve miles when he met a large covered truck, the canvas of which was flapping in the wind. This so frightened his horses that they got beyond control and ran away. They ran north a short distance, then turned to the left, crossed the appellant\u2019s line of railway and entered a field adjoining the railway track to the west. While endeavouring to check the speed of his horses, the respondent dropped the left rein. He continued to pull on the right rein, which had the effect of bringing the horses around in a circle. When they got back to the appellant\u2019s track the horses, instead of crossing the track to the east, ran south along it towards Winnipeg. One horse ran between the: rails and the other just outside of the west rail. When they had gone at full gallop for half a mile they were overtaken and run down by the appellant\u2019s electric car, which smashed the sleigh, severely injured the respondent, killed, one horse and injured the other. To recover damages for his injuries and the loss he sustained the respondent brought this action, in which he claims that his injuries and loss were occasioned solely by the negligence of the appellant, its servants and agents. Among other acts of negligence alleged was the following: (b) In failing to supply and maintain sufficient and adequate lights to enable the motorman to see the plaintiff in time to stop.\nThe appellant denied negligence on its part or that of its servants; pleaded the statute authorizing its incorporation and operation; and alleged that the accident was due to negligence on the part of the respondent.\nThe evidence shews that the appellant operates an electric railway between Winnipeg and Selkirk. The car line is located on the highway, occupying the most westerly part thereof. The car which ran down the respondent was in charge of Motorman W. H. McLeod and Conductor Johnston. McLeod testified that his car was equipped with a headlight which, when in good condition, i.e., at full efficiency, would illuminate the track six or seven pole lengths ahead of the car, and that he could then distinguish a person at five pole lengths. According to him a pole length varied from 125 to 150 feet; but Hawes, the appellant\u2019s superintendent, fixed it at about 140 feet.\nMcLeod left Winnipeg for Selkirk at 5.30 p.m., and arrived at Selkirk at 6.20 p.m. He testified that he had trouble with the headlight on his way up. The light flickered and was very dim. He thought the trouble was with the carbon, so, on reaching Selkirk, he got a new carbon and put it in the headlight. At 6.30 p.m. he left Selkirk for Winnipeg. The new carbon did not effect any improvement in the light. Instead of the track being illuminated, as it should have been, for six or seven pole lengths, the light was shewing ahead for only one pole length, and he could not distinguish objects on the track until they were within 70 or 75 feet of the car. The result was that, running on schedule time (30 miles per hour), which McLeod said he was supposed to do, he could not see the stations where intending passengers were waiting, in sufficient time to stop before going by them. This actually happened at least twice between Selkirk and the place of the accident. As the new carbon gave no better light than the former one, McLeod concluded that the trouble was not with the carbon. Twice between Selkirk and the place of the accident he got out and examined the headlight and he noticed that the felt around the door was worn away, letting the wind blow in. He thought this might be the cause of the flickering. The second examination was at McLennan. Two miles farther on the accident happened. The track at the place where the accident happened was straight and level for a mile each way.\nThe jury found that the appellant had been guilty of negligence which caused the respondent\u2019s injuries and that the respondent had not been guilty of any negligence. In answering the question: In what did the defendant\u2019s negligence consist? The jury said:\nNot having any man on duty at Selkirk capable of making adjustments to the lights or other equipment to the car before leaving Selkirk on the night of the accident, as the evidence submitted shows the headlight was not sufficiently powerful to illuminate the track for the motorman to see an object far enough ahead to avoid the accident.\nTo understand that answer, further reference to the evidence is necessary. The testimony shews that the appellant kept at Selkirk a barn foreman whose duty it was to superintend the equipment, including the headlights, and keep it all in good working order. He, however, left the barn each day at 6 p.m., after which time the appellant had no one at the barn except the night watchman, who knew nothing whatever about repairing headlights, and had no duties in connection therewith. When, therefore, McLeod brought his car with the headlight which he thought defective to Selkirk at 6.20 p.m., there was no one there who could repair it. In view of these facts, which were undisputed, and the fact that the appellant\u2019s car was running on the unlighted highway at a rate of speed of at least 30 miles an hour, the answer of the jury in my opinion, amounts to a finding that, under the circumstances, the appellant was negligent in not having on this car a headlight functioning with sufficient power to enable the motorman to see objects on the track in time to avoid running over them. The first part of the answer suggests that had the appellant had a man at Selkirk on the night of the accident who could have remedied any defect in the headlight, the track, on the return trip, would have been illuminated ahead for six or seven pole lengths and, as McLeod could stop his car in three pole lengths, the accident would not have happened. The jury having found that the accident resulted from the use of an insufficient headlight, the next question is, was the appellant under any obligation to supply the car with a headlight functioning adequately having regard to the speed at which it was necessary to operate the car to maintain schedule time. In the first place it is to be noted that the respondent was injured on the highway where he had a right to be unless there was some statutory provision limiting his right.\nThe statutes applicable are: c. 78, Statutes of Manitoba, 1900 (the appellant\u2019s special Act of Incorporation), as amended by c. 90 of the Statutes of 1904 (Private); and the Manitoba Railway Act which is incorporated therein.\nThe material provisions are sections 38 and 40 of the Railway Act; section 13 of c. 78, and clause (d) of the agreement entered into between the appellant and the various municipalities through which the appellant\u2019s line ran. In part they read as follows:\n38. No person other than those connected with or employed by the railway company shall walk along the track thereof, except where the same is laid across or along a highway, and not even then if the track be laid on a separate and distinct part of such highway and it be so expressed or understood between the company and the municipal council in whose territory such highway is comprised * * *.\n40. Every railway company shall at all times provide adequate equipment and motive power for the efficient working and operation of the railway.\n13. The rails of the railway, when the railway is constructed along the street or highway as aforesaid, shall be laid flush (as nearly as practicable) with such street or highway and the railway track shall conform to the grades of the same, so as to offer the least possible impediment to the ordinary traffic of the said streets and highways, consistent with the proper working of said railway.\n(d) All cars and trains shall have the right-of-way on the said tracks and highways, and any vehicle, horseman or foot passenger on said track shall, on the approach of any car, give such car right-of-way.\nThere is nothing in these sections which interferes with the respondent\u2019s right to use the highway. Had the municipalities, in their agreements with the appellant, consented to have the public excluded from walking on that part of the highway covered by the appellant\u2019s track, s. 38 of the Railway Act, in the absence of s. 13 of c. 78, would be operative, and walking on the track prohibited. For two reasons, however, I am of opinion that no such prohibition existed. In the first place, the municipalities did not, either expressly or impliedly, consent thereto. On the contrary, clause (d) above quoted recognizes the right of pedestrian or vehicular traffic to use the portion of the highway covered by the track, subject only to giving a right of way to the appellant\u2019s cars. In the second place, s. 13 is impliedly inconsistent with the existence of any restriction on the right of the public to use every part of the highway. Section 13 requires the rails to be laid as nearly as practicable flush with the highway, \u201cso as to offer the least possible impediment to the ordinary traffic\u201d on the highway. This clearly contemplates that traffic may be carried on along that part of the highway on which the rails are laid. Section 13 is part of a special Act into which the provisions of the Railway Act\u2014which is a general Act\u2014have been incorporated. In Maxwell on the Interpretation of Statutes, 6th ed., page 328, the learned author says:\u2014\nWhen a general Act is incorporated into \u00e0 special one, the provisions of the latter would prevail over any of the former with which they were inconsistent.\nAs section 13 impliedly leaves the whole of the highway open for use by the public, it would prevail over any restriction on that use provided for by s. 38 of the Railway Act. The respondent had, therefore, a right to be upon that part of the highway occupied by the appellant\u2019s tracks, but, on the approach of the appellant\u2019s car, he was under obligation to give it the right of way. This obligation implies that he would be made aware of the approach of the car in time to get off the track. He was not made aware of its approach until it was impossible for him to leave the track and, under the circumstances, he probably would not have been able to vacate the track even had he been aware of the car\u2019s proximity.\nFor the appellant it was contended that neither the statute nor the agreement it made with the municipalities requires the appellant to equip its cars with a headlight of any particular intensity or\/indeed, with any headlight at all, and that, having complied with all the statutory requirements, it owed no duty to the respondent other than not to wilfully injure him. It is, no doubt, true that the statute does not in terms prescribe that a headlight shall form part of the necessary equipment, but it does require the appellant \u00e2t all times to provide adequate equipment for the efficient operation of its railway. Such adequate equipment in the case of a tram car driven at high speed along a dark highway at night, in my opinion, certainly includes an effective headlight. But even if headlights should not be included in the term \u201cadequate equipment,\u201d it is well established law that although a railway company has not violated any statutory provision, yet it may be found guilty of negligence by reason of its failure to perform an obligation imposed upon it by common law. This is made clear by the language of the Privy Council in Rex v. Broad[6], where their Lordships say:\nThe making of general regulations and the particular compliance with them still left those in charge of the working of the traffic bound to exercise whatever measure of care might in law be their appropriate duty upon the occasion in question.\nIt is also well established law that statutory authority to operate a railway does not authorize its operation in a negligent manner or in a manner which unnecessarily causes damage to others. C.P.R. v. Roy[7].\nApart, therefore, from any statutory requirement, as the respondent had a right to be on the highway, there was a duty imposed upon the appellant at common law to exercise such care as the law calls for to prevent injury to him, since without negligence on his own part, he found himself upon the railway track and unable for the moment to get out of the way of the approaching car. The degree of care which the law calls for is \u201cthat care which a reasonably prudent man would exercise under the circumstances.\u201d Whether or not the appellant\u2019s motorman, under the circumstances as known to him, acted as a reasonably prudent man in running his car on schedule time without a better light than he had, is a question of fact as to which no legal rules can be laid down. The jury had before it two pieces of evidence from which an inference could be drawn that he did not. The first of these is that the appellant anticipated that the public might frequent its tracks. This is shewn by its having inserted in the agreement a clause requiring that \u201cany vehicle, horseman or foot passenger on said track shall, on the approach of any car give such car right of way.\u201d The second is that the appellant, by itself furnishing a headlight, which, when at full efficiency, would illuminate the track for six or seven pole lengths, had shewn what in its opinion was an adequate headlight for the efficient operation of its cars and the safety of the public The supplying of such a headlight to its cars was most cogent evidence against the appellant as to what a proper headlight should do, and this standard of care established by the appellant itself may well have been taken by the jury to be that which a reasonably prudent man would have adopted under the circumstances.\nI am therefore of opinion that there was evidence to justify the jury in finding that a headlight, which illuminated the track for one pole length only, was totally inadequate where the car was being driven at night on the country highway at a speed of thirty miles per hour.\nWe were not referred to any Canadian or English case similar to the one before us, but the American case of Gilmore v. Federal Street & Pleasant Valley Passenger Ry. Co.[8], seems in point. At page 33 of the report the court says:\u2014\nThe degree of care to be exercised must necessarily vary with the circumstances, and therefore no unbending rule can be laid down, but there is no difficulty in saying that it is negligence to run a car along a narrow and unlighted alley in a dark night at a rate of speed that will not permit its stoppage within the distance covered by its own headlight.\nOn the argument a number of cases were cited in which individuals had been injured by steam railways. There can be no analogy between the duty owed to a person on its track by a railway company, the cars of which are run over the company\u2019s own private property where the public, generally speaking, have no right to be, and where the company is not called upon to anticipate their presence, and the duty owed by the appellant to the respondent in this case, where the cars were run upon the highway, from no part of which the public were excluded and where the appellant had reason to anticipate some persons might be.\nCounsel for the appellant contended that the verdict could not stand because the jury had not found the particular defect in the headlight which caused its dimness. In my opinion this contention cannot be supported. The jury found that the headlight on that car would not illuminate the track far enough ahead for safety. Why it would not do so was a matter into which they did not inquire; nor were they called upon to do so. Whether it arose from the wind getting into the headlight, as McLeod seemed to think, or because the connection between the headlight and the electric wire became deranged, or because the voltage was lowered by overloading the line, as the appellant\u2019s superintendent suggested, is immaterial; the duty was upon the appellant to keep its car equipped with a headlight which would properly illuminate the track, and if any of these suggested causes interfered to prevent adequate illumination, the appellant should have removed the interfering cause. To rush along an unlighted highway at 30 miles an hour with the headlight as it was amounts, in my opinion, to sheer recklessness; and the jury has in effect so found.\nIt was also suggested that the appellant had done its whole duty as far as the headlight was concerned, when it equipped the car with a standard type of headlight which was largely used in Canada and the United States. Surely it is idle to contend that the appellant discharged its full duty by equipping the car with a standard headlight, if that headlight, for some reason or other, did not function. It is an adequately functioning headlight that it is the appellant\u2019s duty to supply.\nCounsel for the appellant further contended that the finding of the jury, carried to its logical conclusion, \u201cwould impose upon the defendant the duty of operating its cars and trains at such a speed that if any object is on the track the car could be brought to a stop without colliding with the object, and under all circumstances, such as fog, rain, sleet, snow, wind and snow and track curves,\u201d etc This, in my opinion, is entirely beside the question. The jury were not dealing with conditions of fog, sleet, track curves, etc.; what they held, and all that they held, was, that, given the hour, place and speed at which the car was being driven at the time of the accident, it was negligence so to run that car with a headlight which did not permit the motorman to see objects within the distance in which it could be stopped. I agree that the appellant is not an insurer of the public. Its duty is to have its cars operated with due care for the public safety. But how it can be said that to drive a car, at night along a dark highway which the public have a right to frequent, at thirty miles an hour with a light which reflects only 140 feet ahead, and enables the motorman to distinguish objects only at 70 feet ahead, when the car cannot be stopped in less than 420 feet, was taking that reasonable care for the safety of the public which it is common ground it was the duty of the appellant to take, passes my comprehension. If the appellant had blindfolded its motorman at Selkirk and told him to drive to Winnipeg at thirty miles an hour and a person on the track was injured, could it be contended that the appellant was not negligent if the accident occurred by reason of the inability of the motorman to see in front of him? Yet to my mind that is practically the situation existing here. The motorman was not blindfolded, but he was given a car with a headlight which did not enable him to distinguish objects beyond 70 feet, although required to run at a schedule rate such that he could not stop the car in less than 420 feet, and the accident occurred because he could not see far enough ahead to stop his car before running over the respondent.\nIn my opinion the judgment of the Manitoba Court of Appeal was right and should be affirmed. I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nSmith J.\u2014The respondent (plaintiff) at the trial by jury recovered judgment against the appellant (defendant) for damages sustained through being struck by one of the appellant\u2019s cars. An appeal to the Court of Appeal for Manitoba was dismissed, and the appellant now appeals to this Court.\nFrom Winnipeg north to Selkirk, a, distance of nineteen miles, there is a highway called Main street, 132 feet wide, on the westerly side of which is located the appellant\u2019s line of railway. Between the railway and the main travelled highway there is a ditch, the depth and width of which are not described in the evidence, but which is marked on the plan as being on the space about 35 feet wide, extending from the easterly side of the railway to the westerly side of the main traveled road. There is another ditch along the east side of the main travelled road, and then a dirt road east of the latter ditch. The appellant\u2019s railway is located where it is under statutory authority and agreement with the municipalities, and is constructed like an ordinary railway line, having ties laid on the surface with ballast between, the rails on top projecting upwards their full depth above the ties and ballast, so that both ties and rails are above the ground level. Built-up crossings were therefore necessary, to enable traffic to cross both ditch and railway, and were provided where required.\nThe respondent was driving in his sleigh with a team of horses from Winnipeg northerly along the main travelled road referred to, after dark on the evening of the second day of January, 1926, and, at a point about ten miles north of Winnipeg, met a motor truck, at which his horses became frightened, and ran away. They turned to the left over one of the crossings of the railway which led on to the prairie at the west. Here respondent says he lost one of the reins, and, pulling on the other, caused the horses to make a circuit, which brought them back on to the crossing, from which they turned south along appellant\u2019s railway line. About half a mile south of the crossing, the horses, still running along the track, one on each side of the westerly rail, were overtaken by defendant\u2019s car, which struck with force respondent\u2019s outfit, smashing it, killing one of the horses, and injuring the other and the respondent himself.\nThe following are the questions submitted to the jury, and the answers:\u2014\n1. Were the defendants guilty of negligence? Yes.\n2. If so, in what did this negligence consist? Not having any man on duty at Selkirk capable of making adjustments to the lights or other equipment to the car before leaving Selkirk on the night of the accident.\n3. If the defendants were negligent, was the injury to the plaintiff caused by their negligence? Yes.\n4. Was the plaintiff guilty of contributory negligence? No.\n5. If so, in what does such negligence consist? None.\n6. Might the defendant\u2019s servants, after the position of the plaintiff became apparent, by the exercise of reasonable care have prevented the accident? No, none from the evidence submitted. The motorman did all in his power to avoid the accident.\n7. At what sum do you assess the plaintiff\u2019s damages? Special $35455. General damages $2,000.\nPlaintiff\u2019s counsel requested the Judge to direct the jury to make a more explicit finding in regard to question no. 2. After argument, His Lordship again addressed the jury, and referred to questions 1 and 2, and proceeded:\u2014\nI merely point out to you that in enumerating the particulars of negligence or negligent acts charged in the pleading against the defendant, the answer that you have given was not one of these particulars. There is no allegation in the statement of claim that the defendants were negligent in not having a man on duty at Selkirk capable of making adjustments to the lights and so on. The allegation was that the light, that the system itself, was defective. The allegation was\u2014\nMr. Guy: My Lord, I don\u2019t think your Lordship should suggest what the answer might be to the question. They heard all this before.\nAfter some discussion, His Lordship proceeded:\u2014\nThe allegation of negligence with regard to lights is this: In failing to supply and maintain sufficient and adequate lights to enable the motor- man to see the plaintiff in time to stop. Now, that is the allegation of negligence that the plaintiff makes against the defendant. Have you any finding in respect to that. They don\u2019t say in their particulars that the defendant was negligent because he did not have a capable man at Selkirk barn and so on. They don\u2019t say that at all. They say they were negligent in failing to supply ample and sufficient and adequate lights to enable the motorman to see the plaintiff in time to have stopped. So I would be quite willing to give to you an opportunity to reconsider or more fully consider that question and the answer in the light of what I have read to you as containing what the plaintiff complains of.\nThe jury retired, and defendants\u2019 counsel renewed an objection that he had previously made, that the allegation just read to the jury as constituting negligence was not in point of law negligence, but His Lordship replied that he had explained the law to the jury the best he was able.\nThe jury returned and said they had added to their former answer to question no. 2, so as to now make it read as follows:\u2014\nAnswer: Not having any man on duty at Selkirk capable of making adjustments to the lights or other equipment to the car before leaving Selkirk on the night of the accident, as the evidence submitted shows the headlight was not sufficiently powerful to illuminate the track for the motorman to see an object far enough ahead to avoid the accident.\nThe learned judge\u2019s exposition of the law to the jury that he referred to in answer to Mr. Guy\u2019s objection was in general terms, namely, that to create liability there must be a duty on the defendant to protect the plaintiff, a breach of that duty, and damage to the plaintiff resulting from that breach through a natural and continuous sequence of events uninterruptedly connecting the breach of duty with the damage. This, of course, did not enlighten the jury as to whether, as a matter of law, it was the duty of the defendant to have a headlight sufficiently powerful to enable the motorman to see the plaintiff in time to stop. The jurymen were left to decide the point for themselves, and found that there was such duty, and also a duty to have had a man at Selkirk on the night of the accident capable of making adjustments to the lights and other equipment to the car before it left Selkirk, and a breach of both these duties.\nAs to the neglect to have a man on duty at Selkirk, it seems clear that there was no such obligation on the defendants. Their duty to the public as to the condition and equipment of the car was in operating it, to have it in a condition to be operated without undue danger to the public, and, whether or not they had a man on duty capable of putting it in such condition would make no difference. This ground of negligence was not alleged or attempted to be proved, and counsel for plaintiff urged the trial judge to point this out to the jury, as he did. The plaintiff\u2019s case therefore rests entirely on the finding that defendants were under a duty to have on the car a headlight sufficiently powerful to illuminate the track for the motorman to see an object far enough ahead to avoid the accident. An attempt has been made to read into the answer some other meaning. One of the learned judges in the court below reads it as a finding of too great speed, which he gives as thirty to thirty-five miles per hour. The only evidence as to speed was by plaintiff\u2019s witness, the motorman, who said: \u201cI was going possibly thirty miles an hour.\u201d The learned judge, in the course of the trial, remarked that to say this rate was negligence was absurd, and in his charge told the jury that they might disregard this element, which they did, inasmuch as they have not said a word about speed. It has also been urged that this answer implies a finding that the particular lamp on this car was out of order at the time of the accident. The answer, to my mind, plainly indicates that in the opinion of the jury it was the duty of the defendants to have a headlight of the brilliancy they mention, regardless of whether it was functioning properly or not. An attempt was made to prove that this particular light was out of order, but the evidence to that effect, if it could be considered as evidence, of a defect that caused the dimness of the light, was of the most vague and feeble character. The motorman said the light was dim, and he thought the carbon was bad. He got a new carbon, and found he was mistaken, as the new carbon made no improvement. He then makes another guess, and says the felt against which the door of the lamp shuts was worn, which allowed the wind to get in and make the lamp flicker. He says he does not know anything about electricity, and would not know how to adjust one of these lamps.\nThe expert witness for the defendants says that a certain amount of flickering is inherent in all arc lights, by reason of the way the carbon burns, the arc gradually moving round the outer edge of the carbon, and that there is a variation in the brightness in any particular direction; firstly, because brightness in that direction depends on whether the arc is at the front, the side or the back of the carbon; secondly, because the voltage on the power line of a railway varies with the varying load it is called on to carry. Again, he says that when the carbon is, automatically adjusting itself, the light will almost go out for a moment. He further shows, by production of the lamp, that the outer casing projects back beyond the felt referred to, so as to carry the current of air back beyond this felt, and that, in any case, air entering there would not cause the light to flicker.\nThe motorman says that, leaving Winnipeg for Selkirk at 5.30 that evening, this light \u201cwas working good,\u201d but says it became .dim, and he changed the carbon at Selkirk, and had trouble with dimness on the trip back to Winnipeg, on which the accident happened.: He does not, however, confine his complaint at all to this particular headlight, but says all the headlights were bad. He says: \u201cI have never had satisfaction with these headlights.\u201d \u201cWell, the headlight, I am speaking generally, the whole bunch of headlights, they are never, satisfactory to my way.\u201d \u201c The headlights are all bad.\u201d\nA boy named Parchinko testified that he was proceeding north along the highway and was standing up in his sleigh, and heard the crash of the collision right across on his left, looked round, and then saw the car lighted up inside, but had not seen any lights or the car till attracted by the crash. The headlight, the motorman says, was lit all the time, and illuminating the track for 150 feet ahead, and the car was lit up inside, and this boy, facing it as it approached on a parallel course 35 or 40 feet away never even became aware of its presence till attracted by the crash at his left hand. He had some power of vision, because he says after the crash he saw the car and lights inside. If he states the truth, the only explanation is that he was not looking in the direction of the car, and, never having seen the headlight at all, he could tell nothing about its brightness.\nI think there was no evidence on which a jury could reasonably find that there was in the headlight in question some particular defect that caused it to function less effectively than it and the other similar headlights used by defendants ordinarily function. The only evidence as to the condition of the headlight after the accident is that it was in good condition and has been in use as usual ever since. It had gone out because the collision had pulled the plug of the cord from its socket, thus severing the connection and cutting off the current. The jury has not found any such defect in terms, and I do not think we can read such a finding by implication into the answer. If such had been the intention of the jury, it would have been easy to say so in direct and simple language. The jury was urged, at request of plaintiff\u2019s counsel, to say whether or not the defendants were negligent by failing in their duty to have a light sufficiently powerful to enable the motorman to see an object on the track sufficiently far off to enable him to stop before hitting it, and, in my opinion, that and nothing else is the negligence found by the added clause.\nThe whole question, therefore, is whether or not the defendants were under legal obligation to carry a headlight of the power mentioned. If not, then the negligence found was failure to do what there was no legal obligation to do, which, of course, would not support the verdict.\nNo case has been cited that goes the length contended for here. We must simply apply the general rule that defendants had a duty towards the plaintiff to operate their cars with the care that a reasonably prudent person would exercise under the circumstances. Plaintiff was carried on to the railway by his runaway team, and the jury has found that he was not guilty of negligence in being there, or when there. The defendants, however, had no reason to anticipate such an unusual occurrence. The construction of the railway, as described, was such that nobody would voluntarily attempt to drive a team and sleigh along it, and in addition it was separated from the travelled highway by a ditch.\nThe Railway Act requires a railway line on a highway to be on a level with the road, with the top of the rails not more than one inch higher, and it is not shown why this was departed from in this instance. It is, however, not important here whether or not defendants were legally entitled to construct their railway above the road surface level as they did, because the condition actually existed, so that it would be quite out of reason to say that it might have been anticipated that some one might be driving his team along the railway. Under these circumstances, I think it cannot be said that defendants were bound to use such a degree of care as would insure against such an unusual and unforeseen occurrence. The possibility of a person walking on the track might, perhaps, be anticipated, but in that case he would also be required to take reasonable care, and the light, even if as dim as the motorman claims, could be seen far enough away to enable him, if keeping a reasonable lookout, to step out of the way. This would also apply to animals on the track, because the owner would also be required to take reasonable care. We are dealing here with a special and unusual case, where the plaintiff was, by no fault of his own or defendants, deprived of the power of exercising the care that would be exercised under ordinary circumstances. Were, then, the defendants bound, as a matter of law, to provide means of insuring against accident under such extraordinary circumstances? The Court of Appeal holds that they were. Fullerton J.A., speaking of defendants\u2019 duty to take reasonable care, says,\nthat a company operating cars at night could not possibly discharge this duty without being able to stop on the appearance of danger.\nTrueman J.A., says,\nthat at night the speed of the car shall be governed by the power of the headlight, so that when an object on the track is seen, the car can be stopped in time. \u00c0 lookout, to be worth the name, must be subject to this condition.\nOne of the passengers testifies that it was snowing and stormy at the time of the accident, but respondent says it was a nice, clear night.\nThese judgments, however, go the full length of obliging defendants to insure the public against damage by any collision, quite regardless of conditions. If there is a curve in the track, a heavy snow storm or a fog, the speed must be regulated accordingly. If the conformation of the ground along the track, trees, buildings or other objects, obstruct the view, even in the daytime, speed would have to be regulated in the same way.\nI am not in accord with these views. I think the obligation on defendants to use reasonable care would require them to have a headlight of reasonable efficiency, having regard to the state of the art of artificial lighting at night of cars operating as defendants\u2019 cars do. They were, perhaps, not under obligation to have the very latest and most efficient headlights made, but according to the evidence they had, in fact, the very best lights in use for the purpose. These lights are the standard equipment of similar cars all over this continent, according to the only evidence offered. Plaintiff\u2019s witness, the motorman, thinks they are not bright enough, but neither he nor any other witness says that any brighter or better lights are available. There is, in my opinion, as I have stated, no finding that the particular light in use on this occasion was ineffective by reason of being out of order. I am therefore of opinion that the defendants in having on the car a headlight of the power and efficiency in general use for the purpose on this continent according to the uncontradicted evidence in the case, discharged their duty to have a headlight of reasonable efficiency under the circumstances.\nThe numerous cases cited in respondent\u2019s factum as to the respective functions of judge and jury, and as to interfering with the finding of fact by a jury, seem to me to have no application, because the jury\u2019s finding that is questioned is not as to the fact that the headlight was not sufficiently powerful to enable the motorman to see plaintiff in time to stop. It is their finding, or assumption, that as a matter of law defendants had a duty to have a light of this efficiency. It is conceded that if there was such a duty, the finding of fact as to its breach cannot be questioned. If the jury\u2019s finding of negligence is based on the assumption that defendants had a legal duty to supply a light of the efficiency they mention, the verdict cannot stand if, as a matter of law, the defendants had not a legal duty to take such a degree of care. Many authorities are cited in the appellant\u2019s factum that support the view I have indicated above as to the degree of care respecting headlights that it was defendant\u2019s duty to take[9]. Beven on Negligence, 3rd ed., p. 614:\nThe unbending test of negligence in methods, machinery and appliances is the ordinary usage of the business. All the evidence in this case shows that defendants fully complied with the ordinary usage of the business as to headlights, taking it, as I do, that there is no finding of a special defect in the condition of the particular light: Zuvelt v. C.P.R.[10], is much in point as to the principles involved here.\nAn interesting point is raised in the appellant\u2019s factum as to the effect of section 21 of the Public Utilities Act, R.S.M. (1913), c. 166, which places in the hands of a Commission the power to make orders regarding equipment, appliances and safety devices in carrying out a franchise involving the use of public property.\nMallory v. Winnipeg Joint Terminals[11], decided under the statute, is referred to. In view of what I have said above, I think it is not necessary to deal with this point.\nThe King v. Broad[12], was referred to as discussing the principle, but as it deals with a case of accident at a highway and railway intersection, where people were expected to be crossing, I think nothing can be gathered from it applicable to this case.\nBrenner y. Toronto Ry. Co.[13], deals with ultimate negligence where the defendant\u2019s servant, by anterior negligence, deprived himself of the power to avoid the consequences of plaintiff\u2019s negligence, which he otherwise would have had. Here plaintiff was found not to have been negligent, and it does not seem to me that this case helps.\nIt has been suggested that the answers of the jury are unsatisfactory, and that therefore there should be a new trial. The plaintiff in his statement of claim alleges negligence, as follows:\n(a) A dangerous rate of speed.\n(b) \u201cIn failing to supply and maintain sufficient and adequate lights to enable the motorman to see the plaintiff in time to stop.\u201d\n(c) Defective brakes, and failure to apply the brakes and slow down in time.\nAs I have pointed out, there is no finding of excessive speed under (a), and there was no real attempt by plaintiff to prove excessive speed. I have referred above to the only evidence as to speed and to the judge\u2019s charge regarding it. There was no objection to this, though, after the jury had first brought in their answers, plaintiff\u2019s counsel in a long argument asked the trial judge to give further directions to the jury. Further directions were given along the lines requested, but there was no request for a change of directions on this particular point, nor for a direction to the jury to make a finding with reference to it.\nAs to (c), the plaintiff proceeded at the trial to show, by his evidence, that the brakes were not defective, and that there was no negligence on the part of the motorman. There is no finding of defective brakes, the only evidence on the point being that of plaintiff\u2019s witness, that they were not defective; and there is a finding, in accordance with the evidence of plaintiff\u2019s witness, that defendants\u2019 servants were not negligent.\nThe plaintiff therefore, at the trial, grounded his whole case on the proposition of law that there rested on defendants a duty toward plaintiff to the extent set out in .(b), and the judgment appealed from is grounded on that proposition of law, which, as I have stated, is, in my opinion, unsound. If I am correct in that view, then plaintiff at another trial would have to try some new ground. He has had one chance before a jury on the question of excessive speed, and has failed to get such a finding. He practically acquiesced in withdrawing that ground of complaint from the jury, and I can see no reason for submitting that question to another jury. In fact, I agree with the trial judge that it would be absurd to call 30 miles an hour on a track where there was no reason to expect any person to be travelling, excessive.\nIt would, I think, be unreasonable to allow plaintiff a new trial to prove that the brakes were defective, or that the motorman was negligent, after having proved at the former trial that the brakes were not defective and the motorman was not negligent. The only other point would be as to a defect in the particular headlight in use at the time of the accident. No such express ground of negligence was alleged in the pleadings, the allegation being that the light was insufficient, not because the particular light was defective, but regardless of whether it was defective or not. There was no request to have the jury make a finding as to whether or not there was a defect in this particular light. All the evidence that plaintiff can possibly get on this point was offered at the trial, and amounted to a statement by a witness that it was one of a bad lot in use by defendants. He, however, admitted that he had no knowledge of electricity, and was incompetent to explain defects in such lamps or to adjust them, and that the guess he made as to the carbon being defective was all wrong.\nOn the question of the strength of the light, he says he saw plaintiff a pole length in front, which would be 125 or 150 feet. There is nothing to indicate that the jury believed that he could not see further than 150 feet, and it is quite possible that they did not believe it. The same witness stated that it required about three pole lengths, about 450 feet, to come to a stop from a speed of 30 miles per hour, and all that the answer of the jury implies is that the light was not strong enough to enable the motorman to see that far. If it was a bright night, as plaintiff says, were the jury likely to believe that a large dark object like plaintiff\u2019s team and sleigh with a big box could not be seen on the snow more than 150 feet away, even if there had been no light? The jury had all the evidence before them on this point that can be offered now, and did not see fit to say that the particular light had any defect or was out of condition, nor did plaintiff\u2019s counsel ask the trial judge in his second charge to direct the jury to make a finding on that point. I think, therefore, that plaintiff is not entitled to another chance with another jury of getting a finding of a defect in the particular light.\nThe appeal should be allowed, and the action dismissed, with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitons for the appellant: Anderson, Guy, Chappell & Turner.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Lamont & Bastin.\n[1] 37 Man.

Dans ses notes de jugement, que nous avons lues avec beaucoup d\u2019attention, il r\u00e9f\u00e8re presque exclusivement aux opinions des cinq m\u00e9decins entendus et il dit:\nOn: ne doit pas s\u2019attendre que je prenne parti entre deux opinions diam\u00e9tralement oppos\u00e9es Tune \u00e0 l\u2019autre, et formul\u00e9es par des professionnels d\u2019exp\u00e9rdence et de comp\u00e9tence reconnues, et dont je n\u2019ai pas raison de suspecter la droiture et la sinc\u00e9rit\u00e9.\nD\u2019apr\u00e8s la r\u00e8gle ordinaire d\u2019appr\u00e9ciation de la preuve, les t\u00e9moignages des trois m\u00e9decins, qui nient cat\u00e9goriquement que la p\u00e9rigastrite dont souffre le demandeur ait aucune relation avec l\u2019accident qu\u2019il a subi, doivent l\u2019emporter sur le t\u00e9moignage du seul m\u00e9decin qui l\u2019affirme et cela r\u00e8gle la question d\u2019indemniti\u00e9 pour incapacit\u00e9 partielle permanente. Il faut reconna\u00eetre le grand embarras o\u00f9 les tribunaux se trouvent parfois plac\u00e9s par le manque d\u2019accord entre les professionnels qui expriment des vues diff\u00e9rentes en mati\u00e8re scientifique; et, comme il est arriv\u00e9 en particulier dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce actuelle, en mati\u00e8re m\u00e9dicale, Mais\u2014sauf peut-\u00eatre le cas o\u00f9 la question leur a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e en expertise (art. 391 et suiv. C.P.C.), sur lequel nous n\u2019avons pas \u00e0 nous prononcer ici\u2014la loi ne fait aucune distinction entre les professionnels et les autres t\u00e9moins. Leurs t\u00e9moignages doivent \u00eatre appr\u00e9ci\u00e9s comme les autres, et le tribunal est tenu de les examiner et de les peser comme toute autre preuve faite dans la cause (The Tobin Manufacturing Company v. Lachance[1]. Nous croyons donc respectueusement que le savant juge de premi\u00e8re instance a fait erreur en posant comme \u201cr\u00e8gle ordinaire d\u2019appr\u00e9ciation de la preuve\u201d que la th\u00e9orie de la d\u00e9fense devait l\u2019emporter parce qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait d\u00e9fendue par un plus grand nombre de m\u00e9decins.\nEn outre, lorsque, comme ici, tout un ensemble de faits et de circonstances que ont pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9, accompagn\u00e9 ou suivi l\u2019accident a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en preuve, il est essentiel que le juge leur accorde toute la consid\u00e9ration n\u00e9cessaire. Sans doute, il doit les envisager \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la preuve m\u00e9dicale; mais il ne saurait en abandonner exclusivement l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation aux m\u00e9decins, et c\u2019est \u00e0 lui qu\u2019il incombe de les contr\u00f4ler souverainement et de se prononcer en dernier ressort. Le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure omet de nous donner cette appr\u00e9ciation personnelle. Il para\u00eet s\u2019en rapporter exclusivement \u00e0 celle des m\u00e9decins. Puis, comme les opinions de ceux-ci sont partag\u00e9s et qu\u2019il \u00e9vite de choisir entre elles, le jugement arrive en d\u00e9finitive \u00e0 un r\u00e9sultat n\u00e9gatif, parce qu\u2019il ne comporte pas de d\u00e9cision sur les faits.\nLa question restait donc compl\u00e8tement ouverte lorsque la cause a \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9e devant la Cour du Banc du Roi. A son tour, cependant, cette cour, pour infirmer le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, d\u00e9clare se baser non pas sur l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation des faits, mais sur une pr\u00e9tendue pr\u00e9somption l\u00e9gale qui, en vertu de la loi des accidents du travail, imposerait au patron le fardeau de la preuve. Voici comment le jugement s\u2019exprime: Considering that the plaintiff has proved that, whilst employed by the company defendant as a workman at the time and place and in the manner above mentioned, an accident happened to him in the course of his work which caused him physical injury;\nConsidering that this proof entails a presumption of responsibility in favour of the workman, which the defendant must rebut by establishing that the accident is due to a cause which has no relation to the work at which the plaintiff was engaged when the accident happened;\nConsidering that the burden of making such proof rests upon the employer, and that the defendant has not discharged itself of this burden which the law imposed upon the company defendant, to show that the accident resulted solely from a cause which has no connexity with the work at which the plain\/tiff was employed at St. Alban in January, 1927;\nConsidering that the defendant has failed to prove that the perigastritis from which the plaintiff suffers results from a cause which has no connexity with the work which the plaintiff was doing at the time the accident happened;\nIl est peut-\u00eatre juste d\u2019ajouter que ces motifs se retrouvent seulement dans les notes de .l\u2019un des deux juges qui ont form\u00e9 la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du Banc du Roi; mais il n\u2019en reste pas moins que la ratio decidendi est ainsi formul\u00e9e dans le jugement de la cour.\nC\u2019est avec raison, suivant nous, que l\u2019appelant a combattu cette doctrine. Les accidents du travail, apr\u00e8s l\u2019adoption de la l\u00e9gislation sp\u00e9ciale qui les concerne, ont continu\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre soumis, au point de vue de la preuve, \u00e0 l\u2019article 1203 du Code civil. Seul l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment de faute a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9limin\u00e9 et la th\u00e9orie du risque professionnel lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 substitu\u00e9e. C\u2019est \u00e0 l\u2019accident\u00e9 qu\u2019il incombe de d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il y a eu accident du travail et de faire la preuve de la relation existant entre cet accident et la maladie ou l\u2019incapacit\u00e9 (Loubat, Trait\u00e9 sur le risque professionnel, 3\u00e8me \u00e9dition, n\u00b0 546; Sachet, Trait\u00e9 sur les accidents du travail, 7\u00e8me \u00e9dition, vol. 1, n\u00b0 439). Sans doute, cette preuve est susceptible d\u2019\u00eatre \u00e9tablie par les moyens ordinaires, y compris les pr\u00e9somptions; mais le fardeau n\u2019en a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9plac\u00e9; et, \u00e0 l\u2019exception de l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment de faute, la preuve \u00e0 faire sous la loi des accidents du travail est r\u00e9gie par les m\u00eames r\u00e8gles que dans toute autre cause.\nIl nous faut donc \u00e9carter le motif du jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi; mais un examen critique de la preuve nous conduit \u00e0 la m\u00eame conclusion que celle qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e par cette cour.\nL\u2019appelant avait toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 en excellente sant\u00e9 jusqu\u2019au moment de l\u2019accident. A partir de ce moment, il a souffert de l\u2019estomac, \u00e0 l\u2019endroit o\u00f9 il a re\u00e7u le coup. D\u00e8s les premi\u00e8res heures qui ont suivi sa chute, et toujours depuis, il a ressenti \u201cdes d\u00e9chirements d\u2019estomac\u201d qui, dans les premiers jours, se manifestaient \u201ctoutes les quinze, vingt minutes Le traitement du docteur Desjardins \u00e9tait pour l\u2019estomac. C\u2019est cet organe que le docteur Fortier a examin\u00e9 aux rayons X. Les m\u00e9decins qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 entendus de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019accordent pour dire que la p\u00e9ri-gastrite dont il souffre peut \u00eatre provoqu\u00e9e par un accident comme celui qu\u2019il a subi. En se basant sur les faits dont l\u2019accident\u00e9 et son p\u00e8re ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate, et principalement sur la circonstance qu\u2019il n\u2019avait jamais auparavant souffert de l\u2019estomac, ces deux m\u00e9decins d\u00e9clarent que la l\u00e9sion qui est constat\u00e9e dans l\u2019estomac de la victime est \u201crattachable \u00e0 l\u2019accident\u201d, et que \u201cl\u2019accident seul peut expliquer tout\".\nD\u2019autre part, les trois m\u00e9decins qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9s par la compagnie appuient trop \u00e9videmment leur t\u00e9moignage sur une version de l\u2019accident et de l\u2019historique du cas qui est consign\u00e9e dans un rapport qu\u2019ils ont pr\u00e9par\u00e9 ensemble \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 ils ont fait l\u2019examen de la victime, mais qui ne s\u2019accorde pas sur des points essentiels avec la preuve faite sous serment au cours de l\u2019enqu\u00eate en cette cause. Cela, et le fait que, tout en soutenant que la maladie de l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019est pas le r\u00e9sultat de sa chute, ils se d\u00e9clarent incapables d\u2019en d\u00e9couvrir une autre cause, affaiblit la valeur probante de leur opinion. L\u2019affirmation contraire nous para\u00eet mieux s\u2019accorder avec l\u2019encha\u00eenement logique des circonstances et la succession des sympt\u00f4mes qui se sont manifest\u00e9s. Ces circonstances et ces sympt\u00f4mes sont suffisamment graves, pr\u00e9cis et concordants pour nous permettre de d\u00e9cider que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a fait la preuve, qui lui incombait, de la relation entre la maladie dont il souffre et l\u2019accident qu\u2019il a subi, surtout lorsque cette conclusion est d\u2019accord avec celle de deux m\u00e9decins \u201cd\u2019exp\u00e9rience et de comp\u00e9tence reconnues\u201d et dont nous n\u2019avons \u201cpas raison de suspecter la droiture et la sinc\u00e9rit\u00e9\u201d, suivant le t\u00e9moignage accord\u00e9 par le juge du proc\u00e8s \u00e0 tous les m\u00e9decins qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 entendus en cette cause.\nL\u2019appelante n\u2019a pas contest\u00e9 le degr\u00e9 d\u2019incapacit\u00e9 permanente dont l\u2019intim\u00e9 est atteint, non plus que l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e par la Cour du Banc du Roi; elle s\u2019est content\u00e9e de nier la relation de cause \u00e0 effet entre cette incapacit\u00e9 et l\u2019accident. Comme nous sommes d\u2019avis que r cette relation a \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9e, nous devons donc, avec les restrictions que nous avons indiqu\u00e9es, confirmer avec d\u00e9pens les conclusions du jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi.\nAppeal dismissed with costs:\nSolicitors for the appellant: Savard & Savard.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Blanchet, Bilodeau & Roy.\n[1] 22 R.L.n.s. 192.\n",

Dorais K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nMignault, J.\u2014L\u2019appelante, Emma Saint-Denis, \u00e9pouse d\u2019Edouard Marceau, \u00e9tait la fille de feu Edouard Saint-Denis, ancien marchand de Montr\u00e9al, d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 le 25 mars 1926 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 92 ans et quelques mois. Outre l\u2019appelante, feu Edouard Saint-Denis laissait un fils, l\u2019abb\u00e9 Joseph Saint-Denis, qui mourut lui-m\u00eame quand cette cause \u00e9tait pendante devant la cour du Banc du Roi, nommant par son testament olographe sa s\u0153ur comme sa l\u00e9gataire universelle, et Emma Saint-Denis a repris, au nom de son fr\u00e8re, l\u2019instance qu\u2019elle poursuivait conjointement avec lui. Edouard Saint-Denis s\u2019est mari\u00e9 trois fois; la premi\u00e8re fois avec Dame Mathilda Mailloux, la m\u00e8re de Joseph et Emma Saint-Denis, la deuxi\u00e8me fois avec Dame Emma Saneer, et la troisi\u00e8me fois, en d\u00e9cembre 1913, alors qu\u2019il avait pr\u00e8s de 80 ans, avec l\u2019intim\u00e9e, Dame Olivine Thibodeau, qui, elle, avait 70 ans environ. Il n\u2019a eu d\u2019enfants qu\u2019avec sa premi\u00e8re femme, la m\u00e8re des demandeurs.\nQuelques semaines apr\u00e8s la mort d\u2019Edouard Saint-Denis, Joseph et Emma Saint-Denis intent\u00e8rent cette action demandant l\u2019annulation, pour cause de suggestion et d\u2019incapacit\u00e9 testamentaire, de deux testaments et de deux codicilles d\u2019Edouard Saint-Denis, laissant en vigueur un premier testament qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7u devant Mtre Eustache Prud\u2019homme le 26 avril 1918. Il faut dire ici que par son contrat de mariage avec l\u2019intim\u00e9e, Edouard Saint-Denis avait conf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 celle-ci certains avantages, notamment la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des meubles-meufolants dans la r\u00e9sidence des \u00e9poux, la jouissance d\u2019une rente annuelle de $300 pendant le mariage, et l\u2019usufruit, apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9c\u00e8s du futur \u00e9poux, de la somme de $5,000.\nA l\u2019occasion de ce proc\u00e8s pour annulation de dispositions testamentaires, l\u00e9s parties ont donn\u00e9 libre cours aux griefs qu\u2019elles avaient les unes contre les autres, et il en est r\u00e9sult\u00e9 une tr\u00e8s longue enqu\u00eate. De tout cela nous n\u2019avons que faire. Les seconds mariages de vieillards sont rarement chanceux, soit pour les \u00e9poux eux-m\u00eames, soit pour les enfante issus d\u2019un mariage pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent. Dans ce cas, l\u2019histoire s\u2019est r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e une fois de plus, et elle l\u2019a fait \u00e0 sati\u00e9t\u00e9. Il n\u2019importe gu\u00e8re de dire qui a raison et qui a tort. Probablement il y a eu des torts des deux c\u00f4t\u00e9s. Encore une fois, cela ne nous int\u00e9resse pas. Il n\u2019y a qu\u2019une question de validit\u00e9 de testaments \u00e0 juger.\nLes dispositions testamentaires attaqu\u00e9es sont: 1\u00b0 un testament du 23 septembre 1921, devant le notaire Lionel Trempe; 2\u00b0 un testament du 9 mai 1923, devant Eustache Prud\u2019homme, N.P.; 3\u00b0 un codicille du 10 mars 1924, P. G. Coupai, N.P.; 4\u00b0 un codicille du 15 mars 1926, devant le notaire Isidore Coupai, dix jours avant le d\u00e9c\u00e8s du testateur.\nLes moyens d\u2019annulation invoqu\u00e9s sont la suggestion et l\u2019absence de capacit\u00e9 testamentaire. La preuve volumineuse au dossier ne nous autoriserait pas \u00e0 dire que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a exerc\u00e9 une pression directe sur le testateur, mais la question de suggestion, telle que l\u2019appelante la formule, se confond plut\u00f4t avec celle de la capacit\u00e9 de tester. En d\u2019autres termes, le testateur, qui est mort d\u2019une ur\u00e9mie dont il souffrait depuis environ cinq ans, avait-il suffisamment d\u2019intelligence, d\u2019entendement et de m\u00e9moire, et aussi de libert\u00e9, pour pouvoir disposer de ses biens?\nPrenons d\u2019abord le testament Trempe, fait pr\u00e8s de cinq ans avant le d\u00e9c\u00e8s d\u2019Edouard Saint-Denis. Absolument rien ne d\u00e9montre que le testateur n\u2019e\u00fbt pas alors le plein usage de ses facult\u00e9s mentales. Et le testament a \u00e9t\u00e9 si peu sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9e, que cette derni\u00e8re n\u2019en a eu connaissance qu\u2019apr\u00e8s sa confection. D\u2019ailleurs, le testament Trempe importe peu, car il a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9voqu\u00e9 par le testament Prud\u2019homme. Le testament Prud\u2019homme est en date du 9 mai 1923. Edouard Saint-Denis jouissait alors de toutes ses facult\u00e9s, et n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019objet d\u2019aucune suggestion. Le t\u00e9moignage du, notaire Prud\u2019homme, vieil ami du testateur et \u00e2g\u00e9 de plus de 80 ans, supporte pleinement ce testament, et le fait que le Dr Georges Dupont, dont il sera question plus loin, a servi de t\u00e9moin testamentaire, prouve bien que dans son opinion le testateur pouvait alors tester. Saint-Denis a discut\u00e9 longuement avec le notaire la r\u00e9daction de ce testament. Il voulait emp\u00eacher son gendre, Marceau, de se m\u00ealer de l\u2019administration de ce qu\u2019il donnerait \u00e0 sa fille, et, d\u2019apr\u00e8s le conseil de M. Prud\u2019homme, il a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de cr\u00e9er une substitution portant sur la part de Mme Marceau. Tout d\u00e9montre qu\u2019il avait alors pleine capacit\u00e9 testamentaire, et l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a rien eu \u00e0 faire avec la pr\u00e9paration du testament, M. Prud\u2019homme ayant eu soin de l\u2019\u00e9carter quand il s\u2019agissait des instructions que le testateur lui donnait pour ce testament.\nLa p\u00e9riode plus douteuse commence quelques mois apr\u00e8s ce testament. M. Saint-Denis avait dit au notaire Prud\u2019homme qu\u2019il voulait laisser une vingtaine de mille dollars pour des \u0153uvres de charit\u00e9, et le notaire lui avait expos\u00e9 que, pour \u00e9viter des proc\u00e8s, il fallait nommer les institutions b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires du legs, ce que Saint-Denis promit de faire. Celui-ci se transporta au bureau du notaire pour lui donner ce renseignement, mais \u00e0 peine rendu il avait oubli\u00e9 le nom des institutions qu\u2019il voulait favoriser, et M. Prud\u2019homme en conclut que Saint-Denis n\u2019avait plus de m\u00e9moire et que son esprit n\u2019\u00e9tait pas suffisamment lucide pour pouvoir tester. Il d\u00e9clina donc de recevoir un codicille pour lui, et sur les conseils et par l\u2019initiative d\u2019un p\u00e8re oblat qui le visitait, Saint-Denis fut mis en rapports avec un jeune notaire, P. C. Coupai, qui re\u00e7ut le codicille du 10 mars 1924, auquel son fr\u00e8re, Isidore Coupai, alors \u00e9tudiant, comparut comme t\u00e9moin.\nTout ce que ce codicille ajoute au testament Prud\u2019homme, c\u2019est le legs en faveur de l\u2019intim\u00e9e d\u2019une maison sur la rue Chambord, \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, d\u2019une valeur, dit-on, d\u2019environ $5,000. Il n\u2019est pas douteux que depuis un certain temps Saint-Denis songeait \u00e0 donner cette maison \u00e0 sa femme, car il en avait parl\u00e9 au notaire Prud\u2019homme. C\u2019\u00e9tait deux ans avant le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de Saint-Denis, qui sortait encore en voiture, \u00e9t il n\u2019y a aucune preuve de pression ou de suggestion frauduleuse d\u00e9 la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. D\u2019apr\u00e8s le notaire et les personnes qui l\u2019ont vu, le testateur comprenait bien ce qu\u2019il faisait. Ces t\u00e9moignages ont \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9s par le juge du proc\u00e8s et par la cour d\u2019appel.\nVenons-en au dernier codicille, celui re\u00e7u dix jours avant le d\u00e9c\u00e8s du testateur par Isidore Coupai, qui depuis peu avait \u00e9t\u00e9 admis \u00e0 l\u2019exercice de la profession de notaire, et qui visitait souvent les \u00e9poux Saint-Denis. Ce codicille contient deux clauses. La premi\u00e8re dispense l\u2019intim\u00e9e de l\u2019obligation de rendre compt\u00e9 aux h\u00e9ritiers du testateur des sommes qu\u2019elle aurait re\u00e7ues du testateur ou qu\u2019elle aurait d\u00e9pens\u00e9es provenant de ses fonds. La seconde exprime la volont\u00e9 du testateur que ses h\u00e9ritiers et son ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire se servent du notaire instrumentant pour l\u2019enti\u00e8re ex\u00e9cution de ses dispositions testamentaires.\nCette derni\u00e8re clause a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 sugg\u00e9r\u00e9e au testateur par le notaire instrumentant? Celui-ci l\u2019explique en affirmant que Saint-Denis lui avait souvent dit qu\u2019apr\u00e8s sa mort, il (le notaire) devrait avoir soin de Mme Saint-Denis, qu\u2019il serait, \u00e0 cause de sa situation \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, celui le plus en vue pour avoir soin de ses affaires. On ne peut cependant se d\u00e9fendre de penser que le notaire lui-m\u00eame n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tranger \u00e0 l\u2019insertion de cette clause au testament. Il y avait inconvenance, pour dire le moins, pour le notaire instrumentant, de stipuler ainsi, ou de laisser stipuler, en sa faveur dans un testament qui se faisait par son minist\u00e8re.\nM. Coupai \u00e9tait alors un tout jeune notaire, et on peut facilement croire qu\u2019il manquait d\u2019exp\u00e9rience. Le code civil (art. 846) ne met pas de c\u00f4t\u00e9 le testament qui contient un legs en faveur du notaire instrumentant, mais se contente d\u2019annuler le legs lui-m\u00eame. La stipulation au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de M. Coupai n\u2019est pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment un legs, mais c\u2019est une clause qui \u00e9tait cens\u00e9e lui conf\u00e9rer un certain avantage, partant une clause \u00e0 l\u2019insertion de laquelle il avait int\u00e9r\u00eat. Il est de principe, et nous pourrions ajouter presque d\u2019ordre public, que l\u2019acte re\u00e7u par un notaire ne contienne pas une stipulation en sa faveur. La loi d\u00e9fend au notaire de recevoir un acte ou contrat dans lequel il est une des parties contractantes (S.R.Q. 1925, c. 211, art. 38). Il est impossible, donc, de ne pas regarder comme une circonstance aggravante l\u2019insertion d\u2019une telle clause dans le deuxi\u00e8me, codicille, mais il n\u2019en r\u00e9sulte pas que le codicille lui-m\u00eame soit nul si le testateur qui y a consenti avait alors une capacit\u00e9 testamentaire suffisante pour le comprendre. Et quant \u00e0 la clause elle-m\u00eame, elle ne peut plus avoir d\u2019effet, car le d\u00e9lai pour ex\u00e9cuter le testament est expir\u00e9 depuis longtemps. Il serait donc inutile maintenant de l\u2019annuler, bien que cette annulation ait \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9e par l\u2019appelante.\nNous pouvons faire une autre observation au sujet de ce deuxi\u00e8me codicille. Le notaire para\u00eet avoir re\u00e7u ses instructions pour la pr\u00e9paration de ce codicille de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, et tout ce qu\u2019il peut dire dans son t\u00e9moignage, c\u2019est que le testateur y a pleinement consenti, quand il lui a lu le codicille. C\u2019\u00e9tait, pour dire le moins, un moyen d\u2019agir tr\u00e8s p\u00e9rilleux, et si le codicille avait contenu une disposition importante des biens du testateur, l\u2019objection aurait pu \u00eatre tr\u00e8s grave. Mais il s\u2019agit ici d\u2019un testateur qui avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 dispos\u00e9 de ses biens par un testament et un premier codicille que nous croyons inattaquables. On lui rappelle qu\u2019il y a danger que sa femme soit troubl\u00e9e apr\u00e8s sa mort par une action en reddition de compte \u00e0 raison de transactions d\u2019argent qu\u2019elle a eues avec lui. Si le testateur, m\u00eame dans son \u00e9tat tr\u00e8s affaibli, pouvait comprendre l\u2019opportunit\u00e9 de soustraire sa femme \u00e0 de tels ennuis, nous ne croyons pas qu\u2019on doive mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 la clause en faveur de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, alors m\u00eame que nous serions d\u2019avis que le testateur n\u2019aurait pu alors faire une disposition importante de ses biens.\nIl y a une autre consid\u00e9ration. Une telle d\u00e9charge \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s raisonnable dans les circonstances. La preuve constate que Saint-Denis et sa femme se pr\u00eataient mutuellement des fonds quand l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre en avait besoin. L\u2019intim\u00e9e avait un petit capital. Elle avait probablement aussi le go\u00fbt de la sp\u00e9culation, sur une \u00e9chelle d\u2019ailleurs bien modeste. Elle payait toutes les d\u00e9penses de la maison, y compris les m\u00e9decins et la garde-malade. Saint-Denis lui a fait de temps \u00e0 autre des avances d\u2019argent qu\u2019elle dit avoir employ\u00e9es pour des d\u00e9penses de maison, ou qu\u2019elle lui aurait rembours\u00e9es. Tout se faisait comme d\u2019ordinaire entre mari et femme, sans que ni l\u2019un ni l\u2019autre ait tenu des livres ou exig\u00e9 des re\u00e7us. Dans ces circonstances, il\n\u00e9tait \u00e9minemment raisonnable que le mari mourant ait voulu \u00e9viter \u00e0 sa femme l\u2019ennui d\u2019une poursuite en reddition de compte de la part de ses enfants, poursuite que les relations tr\u00e8s tendues entre l\u2019intim\u00e9e et les demandeurs rendaient assez facile \u00e0 pr\u00e9voir. Il n\u2019y avait en cela rien de compliqu\u00e9, ni de difficile \u00e0 comprendre, m\u00eame pour un homme tr\u00e8s affaibli par la maladie, s\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas d\u2019ailleurs en \u00e9tat d\u2019alli\u00e9nation mentale.\nNous pouvons en dire autant de tous les legs que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a re\u00e7us par les deux testaments et le premier codicille attaqu\u00e9s. Ces legs \u00e9taient raisonnables tant par leur montant que par les biens qui en \u00e9taient l\u2019objet. L\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s vieille, et Saint-Denis laissait une succession qu\u2019on \u00e9value \u00e0 $150,000, dans laquelle, s\u2019il n\u2019y avait eu aucun testament, l\u2019intim\u00e9e aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 h\u00e9riti\u00e8re pour un tiers (art. 6246 C.C.). Les biens que re\u00e7oit l\u2019intim\u00e9e sont des maisons, la r\u00e9sidence des \u00e9poux et une autre maison, dont le revenu lui permettra de vivra. Son mari lui l\u00e8gue, en outre, tout le contenu de la r\u00e9sidence commune, son automobile, et une somme de $300 pour son deuil, et tous ces legs ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits \u00e0 la condition expresse qu\u2019elle renonce aux avantages stipul\u00e9s en son contrat de mariage. L\u2019ensemble l\u00e9gu\u00e9 se monte \u00e0 une somme d\u2019environ $25,000, et on ne saurait regarder une telle somme comme d\u00e9raisonnable.\nReste la question de savoir si le testateur avait, \u00e0 la date du dernier codicille, une capacit\u00e9 testamentaire suffisante pour accorder \u00e0 sa femme la dispense de rendre compt\u00e9, car il serait t\u00e9m\u00e9raire de lui nier cette capacit\u00e9 aux autres dates dont il est question ici, surtout en vue des jugements des deux cours qui ont express\u00e9ment reconnu l\u2019existence de cette capacit\u00e9.\nSous ce rapport, nous constatons ici\u2014chose assez ordinaire d\u2019ailleurs\u2014une opposition marqu\u00e9e entre le t\u00e9moignage des experts m\u00e9dicaux et autres, et les dires des personnes qui ont v\u00e9cu avec le testateur, ou qui l\u2019ont fr\u00e9quemment rencontr\u00e9 dans les affaires usuelles de la vie.\nLa preuve m\u00e9dicale, celle des docteurs Georges Dupont, Adonias Lussier et Eug\u00e8ne Virolle,\u2014et on peut assimiler \u00e0 la preuve m\u00e9dicale le t\u00e9moignage de la garde-malade, Mme Pilon,\u2014est d\u00e9favorable \u00e0 l\u2019existence chez le testateur de la capacit\u00e9 de tester \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque du second codicille. Saint-Denis est tomb\u00e9 malade de sa derni\u00e8re maladie en novembre 1925, mais depuis cinq ans il \u00e9tait atteint d\u2019ur\u00e9mie. Le Dr Dupont dit que le testateur, lors du dernier codicille, n\u2019avait pas la capacit\u00e9 de tester, qu\u2019il \u00e9tait devenu enfant, qu\u2019il se croyait pauvre, ne se rappelait pas o\u00f9 il avait mal, et que sa volont\u00e9 \u00e9tait presque nulle. Le Dr Dupont avait refus\u00e9 de servir de t\u00e9moin au dernier codicille. Les autres t\u00e9moins m\u00e9dicaux disent \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s la m\u00eame chose, mais le Dr Virolle reconna\u00eet que dans cette maladie, l\u2019ur\u00e9mie, il y a des pouss\u00e9es aigu\u00ebs et des intervalles d\u2019accalmie, et que dans ces intervalles le malade peut reprendre son intelligence et comprendre les choses, surtout lorsqu\u2019elles sont simples.\nPar contre, le P\u00e8re Legault (celui-l\u00e0 m\u00eame qui l\u2019avait mis en rapports avec les MM. Coupai) visitait Saint-Denis plusieurs fois par ann\u00e9e. Il l\u2019a vu quelques jours avant sa mort et il dit qu\u2019il n\u2019a constat\u00e9 aucune diff\u00e9rence quant \u00e0 son \u00e9tat mental, qu\u2019il a convers\u00e9 avec lui et que Saint-Denis a parfaitement compris tout ce qu\u2019il lui avait dit. Rousseau, un voisin, a vu le testateur \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s un mois avant sa mort, et il lui a paru absolument normal comme d\u2019habitude. Marchildon, aussi un voisin, a visit\u00e9 le testateur dans sa derni\u00e8re maladie, et trois ou quatre jours avant sa mort celui-ci, en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 une question de Marchildon de savoir s\u2019il le connaissait, a dit \u201cioui\u201d, et il s\u2019est mis \u00e0 \u00e9peler son nom. Rivard, son chauffeur, le voyait tous les jours jusqu\u2019\u00e0 sa mort, et il affirme que le testateur a toujours eu sa lucidit\u00e9 d\u2019esprit, d\u2019apr\u00e8s ce qu\u2019il a pu voir.\nIl y a bien aussi le t\u00e9moignage du notaire Isidore Coupai et des t\u00e9moins instrumentales. Ces derniers, bien que m\u00e9decins, n\u2019ont fait aucun examen m\u00e9dical du testateur. Cependant, leur t\u00e9moignage, ainsi que celui du notaire, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 accueillis favorablement par le premier juge.\nDans les circonstances, le t\u00e9moignage de gens absolument d\u00e9sint\u00e9ress\u00e9s qui ont vu le testateur durant sa derni\u00e8re maladie ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9 par la cour sup\u00e9rieure et la cour du Banc du Roi, il est difficile pour cette deuxi\u00e8me cour d\u2019appel de ne pas en tenir compte. Il s\u2019agissait pour le testateur d\u2019une chose bien simple, dispenser sa femme de l\u2019obligation de rendre compte \u00e0 ses h\u00e9ritiers des fonds qu\u2019elle avait re\u00e7us de lui au cours de la vie commune. La preuve accept\u00e9e par les deux cours permet de dire que le testateur pouvait comprendre la port\u00e9e d\u2019une telle d\u00e9charge.\nEncore une fois, il ne s\u2019agit ici que d\u2019une question de fait. Les deux cours sont d\u2019accord pour d\u00e9clarer que les demandeurs n\u2019ont pas prouv\u00e9 leurs all\u00e9gations de suggestion frauduleuse ou d\u2019absence de capacit\u00e9 testamentaire, et, dans un tel cas, m\u00eame s\u2019il pouvait y avoir des diff\u00e9rences d\u2019opinion dans l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation des faits, cette cour n\u2019a pas l\u2019habitude d\u2019intervenir, pas plus que le Conseil priv\u00e9 d\u2019ailleurs. Voy. Robins v. National Trust Co. (1).\nL\u2019appel est renvoy\u00e9, mais ayant \u00e9gard \u00e0 toutes les circonstances de cette cause nous ne croyons pas devoir accorder de frais \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e devant cette cour.\nAppeal dismissed without costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: Armand Mathieu.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Dorais & Dorais.\n[1] Reporter\u2019s Note.\u2014The head-note contained in the report of this case (Q.R. 44 K.B. 207) is founded on the opinion of Mr. Justice Cannon, which was not concurred in by the other judges, and counsel for the appellants submitted no such ground) in their argument before this court.

Baker (Defendant) Respondent.\n1929: February 5; 1929: March 20.\nPresent: Duff, Mignault, Newcombe, Lamont and Smith JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ONTARIO.\nCriminal law\u2014Charge of negligence in performance of duty, causing grievous bodily injury\u2014Cr. Code, ss. 284, 247\u2014Momentary diversion of attention\u2014Conduct not amounting to criminal negligence.\nRespondent was in charge of hoisting machinery in a mine shaft. When a descending cage was nearing the bottom he was required to arrest it and give warning to workmen below (a precaution required by the mining regulations). A dial enabled him to follow the cage\u2019s descent. There was also a buzzer which operated at a certain point to warn him, but on the occasion in question it was out of order. His attention to the dial was momentarily diverted by a violent noise behind him from \u201cclapperboards\u201d (any defective working of which it was his duty to report), and when his attention was restored it was too late to arrest the cage and it struck a workman below. Respondent was experienced and conscientious in his duties. He was convicted under s. 284, Cr. Code, of causing grievous bodily injury \u201cby doing negligently or omitting to do an act which it was his duty to do.\u201d\nHeld: While the arresting of the cage was indisputably one of those duties contemplated by ss. 247 and 284, Cr. Code, yet the respondent\u2019s act, almost involuntary, in yielding, in the special circumstances, to the impulse to turn his eyes to the source of the disturbance behind him, was not an act of such culpability as falls within the category of criminal negligence.\nMcCarthy v. The King, 62 Can. S.C.R., 40, discussed and explained. The decision therein did not attempt to lay down an abstract rule for determining the incidence of criminal responsibility for negligence.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division, Ont., (63 Ont. Lit. 275) setting aside the conviction, affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], setting aside the conviction of the respondent by J.S. McKessock, Esq., Police Magistrate for the District of Sudbury, for that the respondent\nat the Town of Frood, in the District of Sudbury, on or about the 23rd day of September, A.D. 1928, while acting as hoistman in the mine of the International Nickel Company, by doing negligently or omitting to do an act which it was his duty to do, did cause grievous bodily injury to the person of Nestor Peltola, contrary to section 284 of the Criminal Code of Canada.\nThe appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was brought under s. 1025 of the Criminal Code, leave to appeal being granted by Smith J. The application for leave to appeal was made, on behalf of the Attorney General for Ontario, on the ground that the judgment appealed from conflicted with the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan in Rex v. McCarthy[2].\nThe material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal to this Court was dismissed.\nE. Bayly K.C. for the appellant.\nJ.J. O\u2019Connor for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDUFF J.\u2014There is no material dispute as to the primary facts. On the day the offence is alleged to have been committed, the hoisting machinery in one of the shafts of the Frood Mine was in operation raising muck from the bottom of the shaft. The accused was the hoistman in charge of this machinery. There were two cages or skips raised and lowered simultaneously, at the same rate of speed, by the same machinery. Part of the duty of the hoistman was to arrest the machinery as the descending skip was nearing the bottom of the shaft, to give warning of its approach to the workmen engaged there. On the occasion in question, this precaution was not observed, and one of the workmen, caught unawares, was struck by the skip and killed.\nThere was a dial which showed the position of the skips at any moment, and a buzzer which, when working, announced the arrival of the skips at points 100 feet from the top and bottom respectively. On the occasion with which we are concerned, the buzzer was out of order.\nIt was the duty of the hoistman to follow the ascent and descent of the skips, and for this purpose to give close attention to the dial; but on the occasion in question, the attention of the accused was diverted for a moment, and during that moment, the descending skip reached a point so near the bottom of the shaft, that when his attention to the dial was restored, he was too late, with the means at his command, to bring the skip to rest and avert the tragedy.\nThe Mining Regulations require the arrest of the descending skip for the protection of workmen engaged below, and the duty to conform to the regulation is a duty of the strictest order. It is indisputably one of those duties contemplated by sections 247 and 284 of the Criminal Code. The question to be considered, is whether the momentary inattention of the hoistman involved, under the circumstances, a breach of duty of the kind that entails criminal responsibility.\nThe accused was an experienced hoistman, and admittedly had been most conscientious in the performance of his duties. His explanation of his conduct is that his attention was attracted by a violent noise proceeding from some appliances known as \u201cclapperboards,\u201d situated behind him, which appear to be groups of electrical contactors controlling the hoisting apparatus. It was the duty of the hoistman to report any irregularities in the working of the machinery, and these \u201cclapperboards\u201d had been reported upon, but there had been some difficulty in precisely identifying the nature of the defect. There were two sets of such appliances, and there had been some doubt as to which of these was the seat of the trouble. With this in his mind, on hearing the noise on the day of the accident, his attention was immediately attracted with more than usual force to the \u201cclapperboards.\u201d It is conceded that when these \u201cclapperboards\u201d are out of order, the noise proceeding from them may be of a violent and disturbing nature. The official inspector and the mining officials agree that this noise might be expected to produce some distraction of the hoistman\u2019s attention; that in the situation of the accused, only a man of very steady nerves would be proof against the impulse to turn his eyes to the source of the disturbance.\nThe almost involuntary act of the accused, in yielding, in the special circumstances, to this impulse, does not appear to be an act of such culpability as falls within the category of criminal negligence. On this point the decision of the court below is manifestly right.\nThe contention advanced on behalf of the Attorney General is, that, by force of sections 247 and 284 of the Criminal Code, criminal responsibility ensues when there is neglect of a duty to exercise reasonable care in the control of a thing, which, in the absence of such care, may endanger human life; and that\u2014at least where (as here) no question of skill is involved\u2014neglect of such a character as to give rise to civil responsibility gives rise to criminal responsibility also. In support of this proposition, the decision of this court in McCarthy v. The King[3] is cited.\nThis is a misapprehension of the effect of McCarthy\u2019s case3. Two of the judges who took part in that decision expressed the view now advocated by the Attorney General, but that was not the ground of the decision. In that case the court had to consider the charge of a trial judge in a prosecution for manslaughter in these circumstances: the accused, driving an automobile in a frequented street at about twelve miles an hour, ran into a workman working in a manhole in the street and killed him. The manhole was covered by a tarpaulin tent about three or four feet wide at the bottom, five or six feet high and several feet long. The vision of the accused was obstructed owing to the dirty condition of his windshield, and for this reason, he said that from time to time he looked out from the side of the car, but failed to observe the tarpaulin covering the manhole. The trial judge instructed the jury that if the death of the deceased was due to \u201csome want of ordinary care which an ordinary prudent man would have observed in the driving of the car,\u201d it was their duty to convict. He directed their attention to the distinction between the degree of negligence required to affect a defendant with liability in a civil case, and the culpable negligence required to justify a conviction in a criminal case; he presented to them, as the cardinal issue, the question whether the accused was maintaining a \u201cproper lookout\u201d; and he told them, if they were convinced that the accused, if he \u201chad been looking ahead at all as a driver of a motor car should have looked ahead,\u201d would have seen the obstruction in the street, they would be justified in finding him guilty of \u201cculpable negligence.\u201d The trial judge reserved a question as to the correctness of his instruction touching \u201cthe negligence which under the circumstances of the case would render the accused guilty of manslaughter.\u201d\nThe question so stated was the subject of the enquiry in this court, and that inquiry involved an examination of the effect of the sections of the Criminal Code above mentioned, as applied to the facts in evidence and the charge of the trial judge. The court was unanimous in the view that failure to maintain a \u201cproper lookout\u201d amounted, in the circumstances, to culpable negligence within the contemplation of the criminal law, and that, speaking more generally, a want of ordinary care in circumstances in which persons of ordinary habits of mind would recognize that such want of care is not unlikely to imperil human life, falls within that category. But the decision does not attempt to lay down an abstract rule for determining the incidence of criminal responsibility for negligence.\nThis is all that is necessary for the disposition of the appeal. We think it right to add that we see no reason to differ from the view expressed by Sedgwick J., speaking for the majority of this court, in Union Colliery Co. v. The Queen[4], that s. 247 (then s. 213) of the Criminal Code is a \u201cmere statutory statement of the common law.\u201d\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: E. Bayly.\nSolicitor for the respondent: J.J. O\u2019Connor.\n[1] (1928) 63 Ont. L.R. 275.\n[2] [1921] 1 W.W.R. 443; affirmed, 62 Can. S.C.R. 40.\n[3] (1921) 62 Can. S.C.R. 40.\n[4] (1900) 31 Can.

And Mignault, Newcombe, Lamont And Smith JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA (TORONTO ADMIRALTY DISTRICT)\nShipping\u2014Collision\u2014Ship in tow colliding with and damaging a moored ship\u2014Whether tow in fault\u2014Liability of tow for fault of tug.\nThe steamship P., in winter quarters in Owen Sound harbour, with its engines and steering gear laid up, while being moved (under contract) by a tug to an elevator dock for unloading, went past the dock and collided with the moored steamship S. The owners of the S. and her cargo brought action in rem against the P. for damages sustained.\nHeld (1): Upon the facts and circumstances as disclosed by the evidence there was not, during the progress of the towing, any act or omission by those on board the P. constituting a fault causing or contributing to the accident.\n(2.): Although the S. might not have sustained the damage which occurred if the P.\u2019s anchor had not been in the position in which it was, and although the P.\u2019s ship-keeper had encouraged the tug\u2019s captain to leave it in that position, yet the position of the anchor, if it were a fault, was not the fault of the P.\u2019s owners; they had put the tug in\n(1) (1900) 31 Can. S.C.R. 81, at pp. 87 and 88. charge, and their ship-keeper had no authority to direct the stowage of the anchors, for the purposes of the tug; and, moreover, the anchor did not cause or contribute to the collision, and its position did not create liability on the part of the owners, upon well-known principles discussed in Admiralty Commissioners v. S.S. Volute [1922] 1 A.C. 129.\n(3): Assuming, as was justified on the evidence and the course of the trial, that the tug was competent to the service for which it was engaged, the owners of the P. were justified in permitting it to be moved from its moorings to the elevator under the power, direction and control of the tug, and, being not otherwise guilty of any fault, had incurred no personal liability. Further, having regard to the facts (as found by this Court) that, in the towing, the governing and navigating authority was solely with the tug, that the P. had no power to assist either in the way of furnishing power or directing her course, that no one on the P. had any authority or duties which were unfulfilled with regard to the navigation, and all orders from the tug were duly executed, the P. was not liable to the plaintiffs for the damage which, in the circumstances, was sustained by reason of the negligence of the tug. The Devonshire, [1912] P. 21, at p. 49; [1912] A.C. 634, at p. 647; Sturgis v. Boyer, 24 How. 110, at pp. 121-123; The Quickstep, 15 P.D. 196, at p. 201; Marsden on Collisions at Sea, 8th.ed., p. 195; River Wear Commissioners v. Adamson, 2 App. Cas. 743, at pp. 767-8, referred to. It could not be said that, although the tow was innocent of any fault in itself, a maritime lien nevertheless attached to it, as being the instrument which, by reason of the tug\u2019s negligence, caused the injury (The \u201cAmerican\u201d and The \u201cSyria\u201d, L.R. 6 P.C. 127; The \u201cUtopia\u201d, [1893] A.C. 492).\nAPPEAL by the defendant ship Robert J. Paisley from the judgment of Hodgins J., Local Judge in Admiralty, for the Toronto Admiralty District, of the Exchequer Court of Canada, in favour of the respondents, and condemning the appellant, in both of the actions herein, for the damages sustained by the plaintiffs as the result of a collision between the said defendant ship and the steamship Saskatchewan in the harbour at Owen Sound, Ontario, on January 18, 1927. The steamship Saskatchewan was owned by the plaintiff Canada Steamship Lines Limited, and its cargo was owned by the plaintiff James Richardson & Sons, Limited. Each plaintiff brought an action in rem to recover damages, and the actions were tried together as to the question of liability. When the collision occurred the defendant ship, which was in winter quarters in the harbour, with its engines and steering gear \u201claid up,\u201d was being moved (under contract with the owners of the tug) by a tug to an elevator dock for unloading, and the defendant ship claimed that the collision was not caused by any negligence on its part, or on the part of its owners or those on board or in charge of it, and that responsibility for what happened did not lie upon it.\nThe material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was\u2019 allowed with costs, and the actions dismissed with costs.\nR. I. Towers K.C. and F. W. Bartram for the appellant.\nA. R. Holden K.C. and F. Wilkinson for the respondent Canada Steamship Lines, Ltd.\nS. Casey Wood K.C. and G. M. Jarvis for the respondent James Richardson & Sons, Ltd.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nNewcombe J.\u2014The steamship Saskatchewan, owned by the Canada Steamship Lines, Ltd., while lying moored in the harbour of Owen Sound, Georgian Bay, laden with grain, on 18th January, 1927, sustained damage in collision with the defendant steamship, Robert J. Paisley, in consequence of which, on the following day, she sank at her moorings, and her cargo, which belonged to James Richardson & Sons, Ltd., was also thereby damaged. The owners of the ship and cargo respectively brought these two actions in rem in the Exchequer Court in Admiralty, to recover their damages against the Paisley. The actions were, by consent, tried together, as to the question of liability. There are some differences, though not, I think, very material, upon the facts, and there is also a question of law to be determined, arising out of the fact that the Paisley was, at the time, being navigated by the tug Harrison, which belonged to and was under the direction of John Harrison & Sons, Ltd.\nThe Paisley is of 3,762 tons gross, length 266 feet, beam 50 feet, and moulded depth 28 feet, registered at Fairport, Ohio; and she was, at the time, engaged in the Canadian grain trade. It would appear that her owners had entrusted the management of the vessel to the Cleveland Cliffs Iron Company, of Cleveland, Ohio, of which Albert E. R. Schneider was the general manager, and that, on 6th November, 1926, William Richards, the superintendent of the Great Lakes Elevator Co., Ltd., which has a grain elevator at Owen Sound, wrote to the Cleveland Cliffs Company, referring to a telephone conversation of the previous day, and informed the company that John Harrison & Sons, Ltd., of Owen Sound, had a good tug, and would write the Cleveland Cliffs Company in connection with the handling of any steamers which the latter company might send to the elevator. Mr. Richards represented that ice conditions were favourable at Owen Sound, that harbour being usually the last to freeze over and among the first to open in the spring; that the handling would be cheaper there than at other ports, and that every assistance possible would \u201cbe given steamers, and if you can see your way clear to favour us with a share of this business, we feel that we can take care of same to your entire satisfaction, and that it will turn out to be a mutual benefit.\u201d Following this, upon the same date, Harrison & Sons wrote the Cleveland Cliffs Company, at the suggestion of Mr. Richards, and further correspondence ensued. On 2nd December, the Harrison Company wrote Mr. Schneider that they were interested in the Elevator Company, and were anxious to give satisfactory service at Owen Sound, \u201cso that you will be disposed to charter for this port more frequently,\u201d and they put forward their views \u201cas to the cost of handling your three steamers to and from the elevator,\u201d and suggested delay in fixing the charges until the last of the winter fleet should have arrived. By letter of 11th December, the Harrison Company wrote Mr. Schneider, stating that,\nNow that the winter storage fleet has been chartered with fair prospects of all being able to get here, we are prepared to undertake the moving of your steamers with storage cargoes to and from the elevator here at a flat average rate of one-quarter cent (\u00bcc.) per bushel, as per Lake Bills (that is on a Bushel Basis), to include keeping the ice clear as long as possible.\nThis must be subject to immediate acceptance by owners of all storage cargo vessels in this Port; otherwise, we cannot undertake it.\nIn event of any of the steamers being on the bottom and requiring lightering, there will of course have to be an extra charge for this, but we do not anticipate anything of this kind.\nWe have already incurred considerable expense keeping Harbour open and notwithstanding the cold weather we have had, the Harbour is to-day entirely free of ice.\nIt is understood this work will be done at owner\u2019s risk and that your Ship-keeper will direct the mooring of Steamers after being unloaded, the Harbour Master to settle any dispute as to location.\nIf all concerned are willing to give us instructions to undertake this work on above basis, we intend keeping Tug in commission and the Harbour clear of ice as late as possible. If any of the Owners are not satisfied with this offer, we will lay up the Harrison immediately.\nBe good enough to telegraph us one way or the other not later than Tuesday, the 14th, and upon receipt of the acceptance of ail the Owners, we will confirm this arrangement promptly.\nThere was some further discussion as to the rate, but by; telegram of 13th December, Mr. Schneider accepted the Harrison Company\u2019s offer of \u00bc cent per bushel, and on 20th December, the Harrison Company wrote him as follows:\nWe duly received your telegram accepting our offer to have tug Harrison keep harbour clear long as possible and move your steamers to and from elevator, for which we thank you.\nThe harbour is clear of ice and your steamer Presque Isle is under the leg to-day. Do not know whether they will be able to take all the cargo out at this time or not.\nPresume your Charter covers that Shippers of Cargo will pay expense of more than one move. Please send us copy of your Charters, for our information, with reference to this and also give your wheat capacity of each Steamer for our records and oblige.\nAll owners have accepted this arrangement, with exception of Pater-son Steamship Line; they have only one small boat here, and we think surely they will be satisfied to come in.\nIt was upon the terms so disclosed that the towing operations were undertaken and carried out by the Harrison Company.\nThe owners of the Paisely having received the assurances and made the arrangements set out in the correspondence, the Paisley took up her winter quarters at Owen Sound, and was moored on the east side of the harbour, and somewhat to the southward of the elevator, which was situate on the opposite side of the harbour; her bow pointing southerly, or inwards, and immediately below her several other ships were lying moored, alongside of each other. The Paisley\u2019s engines and steering gear were \u201claid up\u201d; the ship was generally put into condition for the winter; the officers and crew were discharged, and left the ship.\nOn 14th January, Mr. Schneider telegraphed the owners of the tug,\nElevator ready to unload steamer Paisley. Place accordingly and notify A. R. Penrice, Ship-keeper.\nMr. Telliard, the chief engineer of the Paisley, who was the last of her officers to leave, and who quitted the ship on the morning of 15th January, tells us that, on 13th or 14th January, Captain Waugh, of the tug, came on board the Paisley to find out about raising her anchors. Mr. Telliard unlocked the windlass room and explained how it was fitted and cleared, and how the windlass should be worked with steam power supplied by the tug, and gave him further requisite information. Captain Waugh then left the ship, and, on the 15th, the ship-keeper arrived, and the engineer went home.\nThe ship-keeper was Alvin Roy Penrice. He was employed by the owners of the Paisley and, according to their agreement, which was dated 22nd December, 1926, and sets forth the terms under which he was acting from the time he took charge as ship-keeper, he was to receive $65 per month, and his regular duties were to look after the boat he lived on, which was the Paisley, as well as other vessels of the company, that might be near him,\nto sound all tanks, peaks and engine room well; record all movements of vessel and work done in connection with loading or unloading storage cargoes; get vessel ready to inspection or fumigation; look after repairs, and perform such work as chipping, scraping rust, painting, removing snow from hatches, as well as any other work called on to do, without extra compensation.\nAnd he was to report in writing to the Cleveland Cliffs office, at Cleveland, every Monday morning; the contract to terminate at any time the owners or their representatives were not satisfied with his services or conduct.\nMr. Richards, the superintendent of the elevator, had informed Penrice that \u201cthe Paisley would be the next boat to go to the elevator.\u201d\nCaptain Waugh, with his tug, came alongside on the afternoon of 15th January, and raised the Paisley\u2019s anchors, supplying the power from the tug and using the ship\u2019s winch in the manner which had been explained by her engineer. The tug had a crew of three or four men, and Penrice assisted with the anchors. Both anchors were brought up into their hawse-pipes, but there was trouble with the stowing of the port anchor, and Captain Waugh considered that it projected so far as to interfere with the navigation of the tug, and it was accordingly lowered again, and permitted to remain suspended and partially submerged.\nPenrice gives the following evidence as to the commencement of the towing operation, about which there is no dispute:\u2014 Q. Now you have told us about the anchors being hove up on the 15th January. Then what was your next communication about shifting the vessel?\nA. On Tuesday, January 18.\nQ. Yes?\nA. The tug came over in the forenoon and Captain Waugh came aboard bringing with him a short piece of chain and said he was going to shift us to the elevator that morning.\nBy His Lordship:\nQ. What do you mean by a short piece of chain? One you had never seen before?\nA. I had never seen this piece of chain before. I went with Captain Waugh to the stern of the Paisley and he put this chain around the bitts on the stern of the Paisley.\nQ. Where was the bitt?\nA. On the fan tail of the stern of the Paisley. I asked Captain Waugh what the chain was for.\nQ. You had no idea, I suppose?\nA. I didn\u2019t know what he was going to use that for. He said that was to hook his towing cable into. He made the chain fast. The cable was pulled aboard from the tug, the towing cable, and made fast to this chain.\nBy Mr. Towers:\nQ. Was that in the forenoon?\nA. It was before noon, January 18.\nQ. Had you any men besides yourself on board then?\nA. I had one man when the tug came. Shortly after the tug arrived my other two men.\nBy His Lordship:\nQ. The towing cable from the tug was made fast to this chain? A. Made fast to the chain.\nQ. Then what was done with the chain, left on the bitts?\nA. Left on the bitts. After that was done the lines were taken in; that is, the mooring lines.\nQ. That is, of the Paisley?\nA. On the Paisley.\nQ. That means she was afloat then, does it?\nA. Yes, sir.\nBy Mr. Towers:\nQ. You said you had some other men on board. Who were they?\nA. Mr. Sykes and Mr. Holmes and Mr. Bechard.\nBy His Lordship:\nQ. Employed under you?\nA. I arranged to have them.\nQ. Employed under you?\nA. Yes, sir.\nBy Mr. Towers:\nQ. For what purpose did you have them?\nA. To assist me in handling lines, taking off hatches and principally to sweep out the boat when she arrived into the elevator, and was being unloaded. By His Lordship:\nQ. Were they aboard this morning?\nA. They were.\nBy Mr. Towers:\nQ. Well, then once you were afloat, what happened?\nA. The tug pulled our stern out away from the dock and then straightened us out and pulled us down the harbour, that is northward.\nBy His Lordship:\nQ. Stern first, I suppose?\nA. Stern first.\nAt this point, according to the chart in evidence, the general direction of the harbour, going inward, is south westerly, and the direct distance from the Paisley, as she lay at her moorings, to the elevator on the opposite side of the channel, is about 700 feet. The course was unobstructed, but, owing to the fact that other vessels were lying at the stern of the Paisley, the master of the tug found it advisable to tow her out in a northerly direction, and so he made fast to his cable, which he had attached to the chain affixed to the stern bitts of the Paisley, and proceeded outwards on a northerly course for a distance of about 1,000 feet, which brought the ship to a position about mid-channel, or perhaps somewhat closer to its western side, and to the northward of the elevator, where those on the ship, by the tug\u2019s direction, cast off the cable from the ship\u2019s stem, and the tug passed upward between the western shore and the starboard side of the ship, and sent up a cable to Sykes, one of the men on board, to make fast to her bow. There was some unimportant delay here, because Sykes attached the cable to the Paisley\u2019s starboard bitts, whereas the tug master desired to use the bitts on her port bow, and, this direction having been executed, the tug proceeded, towing the ship southwesterly by a tow-line the length of which, as between tug and tow, is stated to have been fifteen feet, and with the intention, no doubt, of bringing the ship in some manner to the elevator. At the same time, Mr. Richards, who was in charge at the elevator, sent out four of his employees, who were engaged at storage, to attend to what would be necessary upon the part of the elevator in securing lines and in the mooring of the tow, when she came to her station alongside of the dock. It is here that a difference develops in the testimony, as between the tug master and his mate, on the one hand, and those at the dock and on board the ship, on the other hand.\nCaptain Waugh had given no directions to the ship-keeper, and there was no arrangement or understanding between him and Penrice, or any of the men on the ship, as to the mooring of the ship when she was brought to the dock; but Penrice seems to have supposed that it would be his duty to see to the mooring, and he had his mooring lines and cables on deck, ready for the purpose. There is no apparent reason why the tow should not have been brought directly up to the dock, as her course was nearly parallel with the dock\u2019s face, and the lines would then naturally have been passed over to the elevator employees, who were waiting on the dock to receive them. Captain Waugh, who was the plaintiffs\u2019 witness, indeed, says, in answer to the question, \u201cWhere were you intending, on that dock, to land the Paisley?\u2014A. I was intending to land her along the dock. Q. How far along? You must have had some definite idea where you were going?\u2014A. We were supposed to put her right at the elevator.\u201d What happened, however, according to Captain Waugh, was this:\u2014\nQ. Now how close in to the dock did you get the Paisley before she was abreast of the elevator? You didn\u2019t measure it, but tell His Lordship as near as you can what the distance was from the nearest part of the Paisley to the face of the dock just before she got to the elevator?\nA. When she was immediately northeast of the elevator she was within thirty feet of the dock as closely as I could go, or judge.\nBy His Lordship:\nQ. Within thirty feet of that dock when she was northeast of the elevator?\nMr. Wood: When her bow was, my Lord.\nQ. That is her bow?\nA. Her bow.\nBy Mr. Holden:\nQ. How near does a ship like that need to be to get her line ashore, with the heaving line first and so on?\nA. Well, I think it is practicable for\u2014Well I shouldn\u2019t say I think; I know it is practicable for a man to get a heaving line ashore from a greater distance than that from the dock.\nQ. How great a distance?\nA. Some men can put a heaving line further than others. They should be able to put a heaving line a hundred feet.\nQ. Then did the Paisley get her line ashore when she was thirty feet off, about, before reaching the elevator, as you intended? Did she get a line ashore there?\nA. She didn\u2019t get a line ashore. There was, at the time, no order or gesture by the tug that any attempt should be made to heave a line, although the tug master says that\nI kept on ahead with the steamer till we got past the elevator, expecting that he was getting a line out.\nThen, having passed the elevator, the tug manoeuvred in the following manner:\u2014\nQ. And then what happened, Captain?\nA. I put the wheel hard a port, swung her stern out to clear the steamer, and backed up on her.\nQ. Swung her stern out, that is the tug\u2019s?\nA. The tug\u2019s.\nQ. And then you backed up on the tug?\nBy His Lordship:\nQ. Swung the tug\u2019s stern out and backed up. For what purpose? What was your object in that?\nA. We were supposed to back up and put her nose against the steamer and push her in to her moorings to the elevator.\nQ. Well, where did you push her in, at the bow or stern?\nA. Well, it would depend on\u2014\nQ. What did you do?\nA. I didn\u2019t\u2014I backed up and I saw that they didn\u2019t have a line out and the man on the bow of the Paisley\u2014when I backed up our men carried their line forward on the tug\u2019\u2014\nQ. Well?\nA. And Jimmy was going to let go our line.\nBy Mr. Holden:\nQ. That is Jimmy Sykes on the Paisley.\nA. Yes. and I saw they hadn\u2019t a line on the dock, when I got back far enough I saw there was no line on the dock and that the tow had to be stopped some way.\nBy His Lordship:\nQ. So what did you do?\nA. So I sung out to Jimmy to not throw the line off; I told the mate to take a turn on the timber head forward on the tug.\nQ. Do what?\nA. Take a turn on the line.\nBy Mr. Holden:\nQ. When you say you sang out, this is your line on the tug?\nA. Yes.\nQ. That is your own mate?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And then\u2014?\nA. I backed up on the tug to check the Paisley.\nQ. The Paisley was still going ahead, not enough to run ashore?\nA. The Paisley was still going ahead.\nBy His Lordship:\nQ. And you backed up on the tug in order to put a pull on her?\nA. To stop her. Mr. Holden: You see, my Lord, as she drifted ahead she was pointing right for the Saskatchewan.\nBy Mr. Holden:\nQ. And then what happened? When you tried to stop her what happened?\nA. Well, I backed up on the line; the line commenced to slip on the timber head on the tug.\nBy His Lordship:\nQ. The what?\nA. The timber head. It is a snubbing post. I went ahead on the tug again to give the mate a chance to make fast\u2014The line by this time had all run out but about 4 feet.\nQ. Yes?\nA. The mate\u2014there was an eye on the inside end and he threw the eye over the timber head.\nQ. Yes?\nA. I backed up on the tug again.\nQ. Yes?\nA. And when she got the line tight\u2014taut is a more nautical way of putting it\u2014I rang up for full speed astern.\nQ. Yes?\nA. And the line parted.\nIn consequence, the tow, detached from the tug and deprived of power and steering capacity, pursued her course, and, although another line was substituted and made fast, it was too late to prevent the collision, the Saskatchewan being moored, as depicted on the chart, not more than 350 feet above the elevator, and, as was said in one of the above extracts, directly athwart the Paisley\u2019s course, as set by the tug. There is a suggestion that they were rather slow on the tow in receiving or making fast the substituted line, but Captain Waugh answered, in his examination in chief, that the collision and the consequent breach in the Saskatchewan\u2019s bow could not have been prevented, even if the delay which he alleges had not occurred.\nThe evidence of Mathewson, the mate of the tug, who was also the plaintiffs\u2019 witness, is in substantial accord with that of his captain, although he says he could not see very well, as he was standing low, at the stem of the tug. He says that when they cast off from the stern of the Paisley, and commenced to tow her forward by the port bitts, she was stationary, and that \u201cit looked to me as if it would be an easy job to take her to the elevator\u201d; that at that time their course was due west, two points south, which would bring them almost directly to the land; that he thinks the Paisley\u2019s bow came within thirty feet of the elevator dock when she was less than half way in to the elevator, heading southwest, her stern being further out than her bow, and that he did not know whether she changed that course before striking the Saskatchewan. He makes the following important statement, however, which is consistent with his captain\u2019s evidence:\u2014\nQ. After the tug had passed the elevator, then what happened?\nA. Well, I had been standing right at the tow post.\nQ. Yes?\nA. Watching after my own work. I was expecting a call from the Captain to carry the line up, to move the line off the tow post. At that time I thought they were getting a line out on the Paisley.\nQ. And then what happened?\nA. Well, they got orders to carry the line up, the Captain told me he was going to throw his stern out and back down on the port side of her.\nQ. What for?\nA. To get back in place ready to shove her into the dock.\nQ. And then what happened her?\nBy His Lordship:\nQ. The Captain said he was going to do what?\nA. The Captain said he was\u2014he told me to be ready to\u2014He was going to back the tug down on the port side of her and told me to be ready for to carry the tow line up forward to the forward timber head.\nBy Mr. Towers:\nQ. Where was the Captain, up at the bow of the tug?\nA. The Captain was up in the wheelhouse.\nQ. A hundred feet away from you?\nA. He could stand out there and call to me; I can go up any time he calls.\nQ. Did he call you?\nA. I happened to walk up the side.\nQ. I thought you said you were at the bitts?\nA. I did, but I walked up the side knowing that we had the Paisley up in its place.\nQ. When you had the Paisley up to its place, what did you have to walk up the side for?\nA. To find out if the Captain\u2014to get my orders to move this line.\nQ. To get your orders to move the line. You knew what you would have to do with the line if you were up at your place, the same as you always do?\nA. I knew what I had to do with it, but I wouldn\u2019t do it until I was ordered.\nIn addition, Captain Waugh gives the following answers in his cross-examination:\u2014\nQ. Well then, had there been no slipping on your forward bitts, would you have taken the way off?\nA. Well, if the line hadn\u2019t parted.\nQ. You think you would?\nA. Yes. Q. And then, when you did get a strain on her, if the line hadn\u2019t parted, do you think you would have held it from going down on the Saskatchewan?\nA. I think we could have stopped her.\n* * * * *\nBy His Lordship:\nQ. Do you think you could have stopped her if the line had not parted, but the slip had occurred, before that?\nA. Independent of the slip?\nQ. Yes?\nA. The slip\u2014I think we could have stopped before she hit the Saskatchewan if the line had of held, hadn\u2019t of parted.\nQ. A slip before wouldn\u2019t have prevented you stopping if the line hadn\u2019t parted?\nA. No, it would give us probably a couple of minutes.\nIt seems, therefore, to be a necessary inference that, from the beginning, the project must have been to stop the progress of the tow by reversing the tug, and that this manoeuvre was adopted, not by reason of any emergency, nor because of any failure of anticipated action by the tow to put her mooring lines ashore, but because it was a part of the towing operation, as deliberately designed and attempted by the tug, that the towing should be reversed when the tow had reached the point beyond the elevator where the tug master had directed his mate to shift the tow-line. Admittedly neither he nor his mate knew, nor had tried to ascertain, whether or not any line had been put ashore by the tow, nor had either of them made the ship-keeper aware of any intention or desire on the part of the tug that the ship should, in the circumstances, endeavour to heave a line.\nNow, as to the distance at which the Paisley passed the elevator dock going southerly, and as to whether those on board could reasonably have been expected to put a line ashore in the circumstances, and at that distance, the appellants called the elevator employees, who, when the tug and tow were approaching, had been sent out by their superintendent to attend to the mooring. There were four of them: Dault, Colquette, Ney and Yeo. And, in considering their testimony, it should be remembered that, according to the correspondence, the tug was interested in the elevator company, and had been recommended by the superintendent of the elevator, and, of course, both tug and elevator were concerned in the success of the towing operation and the mooring of the tow. Dault, as he testifies, came out of the elevator when the Paisley was to the north of it, coming southwest; \u201ctoo far out to look for a line,\u201d and during her passage she remained still too far away. The dock was in course of construction at the time, and had been completed only to, or for a very short distance above, the southern side of the elevator. Beyond that there was piling, and Dault walked along, opposite the ship, as she passed. Ultimately a line was thrown, which landed upon a cluster of piles, from which it was recovered, but not in time to be of any use, for, if for no other reason, it was 65 feet out from the nearest . post to which a cable could be fastened. Dault was asked,\nQ. What do you say now as to whether it would have been any use or not to try to get a cable to stop the boat there?\n\u00c0. Well, at the distance the boat was away from the first piling, I don\u2019t think they could have done it.\nHe says that the piling upon which the heaving line fell was about 100 feet south from the south side of the elevator.\nColquette testifies that, when he came on the dock, the Paisley\u2019s bow was to the south of the elevator, possibly about 75 feet, and that he did not expect a line, because she was further out than usual; that in practice the tow comes right up against the dock, or within a few feet.\nNey, the foreman at the elevator, who went out with Dault, says that when the vessel passed, he did not expect a line, because she was too far out, and that, when the line was actually thrown, she was \u201caround in the neighbourhood of 150 feet, I would say,\u201d from the south, end of the elevator, and that, as a rule, the tow is brought right in to the centre of the elevator, to touch the dock.\nYeo came out of the elevator on the south side, and then the ship was passing the elevator, and the pilot house of the Paisley was in view. Asked whether, when he got to the dock, he expected a line to be thrown, he answers:\u2014\nNo, we weren\u2019t looking for one just then.\nQ. Why not?\nA. Well, the boat was out further than usual.\nHe is the man who recovered the line that was thrown from the ship to the piles south of the elevator.\nThese are the witnesses from the elevator, called by the defence. Then comes the testimony of Penrice and his assistants on board the tow, Sykes, Bechard and Holmes. Penrice tells us that the Paisley passed the elevator dock too far away to land a heaving line with which to pull a cable ashore by hand. He estimates the distance at 100 feet, and, according to other evidence, that is a long cast, under favourable circumstances. He had been aft, on the starboard side of the Paisley, and came forward to the forecastle. His testimony in the record, at pages 162, line 9, to 165, line 28, and, in cross-examination, at page 183, lines 9 to 24, is worth quoting.\nA. I looked at the winch to make sure that the forward line was ready for mooring purposes.\nQ. Where had you got to? You only said you came forward up the starboard side. Where did you get to?\nA. I came forward to about No. 1 hatch, between No. 1 and No. 2.\nBy Mr. Towers:\nQ. Where was your forward windlass?\nA. My forward windlass was in the windlass room and the mooring winch was between No. 1 and No. 2 hatch.\nQ. The mooring winch?\nA. Yes, sir.\nBy His Lordship:\nQ. That is the one you looked at, is it?\nA. Yes, sir.\nBy Mr. Towers:\nQ. What did you look at it for?\nA. To make sure the line was ready to heave a line for mooring purposes.\nQ. And was it there?\nA. It was.\nQ. Did the situation cause you any thought\u2014?\nHis Lordship: Why suggest that to him? Just get what was done. If he was under any apprehension that is what he will tell you.\nQ. We have got the mooring line there; you saw it was all right, did you?\nA. Yes, sir.\nQ. What next?\nA. Went from there onto the forecastle, onto the bow.\nQ. What did you see there?\nA. Saw the tug pulling on us.\nQ. At that time?\nA. At that time.\nQ. Pulling in which direction?\nA. Well, I don\u2019t quite understand that question.\nQ. Well, in which direction was the tug pulling you?\nBy His Lordship:\nQ. Towards the elevator or away from it?\nA. Well, he was pulling us about like that. (Indicating).\nQ. That is parallel to the dock line, is it? A. Practically parallel.\nBy Mr. Towers:\nQ. Well how long did that continue?\nA. Oh, maybe two or three minutes.\nQ. And did you stay there during |hat time?\u2014A. I did.\nBy His Lordship:\nQ. Did you say anything to anybody on the tug?\nA. I remember of\u2014as the bow of the Paisley at this time was past the elevator, considerably past\u2014\nMr. Holden: Past the south side?\nA. (Cont\u2019d.): The south side of the elevator, and I passed the remark\nthat it was time\u2014\nQ. I know, did you pass it to the men on the tug?\nA. No.\nQ. I don\u2019t care what you talked among yourselves.\nA. That was amongst ourselves. I had no communication with the tug whatsoever.\nBy Mr. Towers:\nQ. Up to that time had you made any attempt to get a line ashore?\nA. I had not.\nQ. Why?\nA. I couldn\u2019t. It was too far away.\nQ. Had any other man on board, to your knowledge, made such attempt?\nA. They had not.\nBy His Lordship:\nQ. Did you give any instructions to the men at this time? You saw the mooring winch was all right and the mooring line was there and you saw the tug pulling you along and you said something to them on board. Did what you said include any order to them?\nA. No order to the tug at all.\nBy Mr. Towers: Q. To any of your men on the boat?\nA. No, it did not include any orders.\nQ. Well then, what happened?\nA. The tug stopped pulling and backed across our bow, that would be from the starboard bow to the port, slackening up his tow line. Q. Did you see that?\nA. I saw that.\nBy His Lordship:\nQ. She backed across your bow?\nA. Across our bow, and the men on the tug disconnected the tow line from the stern of the tug and carried the bight of it forward on the tug.\nQ. Did you see that?\nA. I saw that operation.\nQ. You saw it perfectly. With any difficulty or without difficulty?\nA. They got the bight of the line forward and they seemed to have trouble in getting sufficient turns on it; the speed of the Paisley going and the tug going astern they didn\u2019t have enough slack in their line to make it fast around the bitts, it was surging or rendering on them. By His Lordship:\nQ. The tug was backing, the Paisley going on, is that right?\nA. Correct.\nQ. And the result?\nA. The men could not handle the tow line.\nQ. They could handle it all right; you said something about they couldn\u2019t get sufficient turns?\nA. Sufficient turns on the snubbing post forward.\nQ. That is what you saw, or was that what you thought?\nA. Well I saw that, and they also had trouble carrying the line past the stays on the side of the tug.\nQ. Past what?\nA. The stays.\nBy Mr. Towers:\nQ. Well then, what, if anything, did you do?\nA. When I saw them having trouble getting the line by I left the forecastle and went down on deck where my mooring line was on the forward winch.\nBy His Lordship:\nQ. That is the main deck?\nA. Main deck.\nBy Mr. Towers:\nQ. You went to the mooring winch?\nA. Well, down to the starboard side, that would be abreast of the mooring winch, picked up a heaving line and endeavoured to pass it ashore.\nBy His Lordship: Q. What did your endeavour consist of, throwing it? A. Throwing it.\nBy Mr. Towers: Q. What distance would you say you threw it? A. Oh, I threw it 75 feet. A. And where did it light?\nA. The end of the line lit on these spring spiles, the furthest spiles to the south\u2019ard on the dock.\nBy His Lordship:\nQ. Did you pay it out then?\nA. Well I had no more to pay out, sir. I had the end of the line in my hand.\nBy Mr. Towers:\nQ. Well then would the Paisley going ahead carry it off at once?\nA. Well it would tend to do that but I walked down the Paisley towards amidships so it wouldn\u2019t be pulled off these spring spiles.\nQ. I show you Exhibit C-2 where \u201cPiles where Yeo got heaving line\u201d are shown. Is that correct?\nA. That is correct.\nQ. Then what?\nA. One of the elevator men secured the end of the line; by this time I was nearly amidships on the Paisley; I called for another heaving line, intending to tie the two of them together and make it fast to the cable. By His Lordship:\nQ. Whom did you call to?\nA. One of the two men I had on the boat, Mr. Bechard.\nQ. For another heaving line?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And\u2014?\nA. He was bringing me the heaving line and I sized up the situation and decided I couldn\u2019t get a line ashore, that is a cable ashore.\nQ. Yes, and\u2014?\nA. And I told Mr. Yeo on the dock to let it go.\nBy Mr. Towers:\nQ. Had you seen anything more of the tug in the meantime?\nA. I had not; I was busy endeavouring to get that line out.\nQ. And why did you decide you couldn\u2019t do it?\nA. Oh it was impossible for\u2014\nBy His Lordship:\nQ. Yes, but why? Why was it impossible? You must have had some reason for making up your mind?\nA. Well, the winches were dead, had no steam, I couldn\u2019t pull them out; I had experience with that with the other boat.\nQ. Well, but I thought you said the winch was all right, the mooring winch?\nA. It was ready; what I mean by that, sir, the cable was out and through the chock and on the deck to take a heaving line there, but to get that line out you have to pull it out by man power.\nQ. Yes, well?\nA. And that is a very slow operation when there is no steam on a winch.\nBy Mr. Towers:\nQ. Those were the conditions under which you started, were they?\nA. They were.\nQ. Now you say that you sized up the situation and decided you couldn\u2019t get a cable ashore. Now just elaborate the reasons that made you come to that conclusion?\nA. Well it was too far off, firstly.\nQ. Yes?\nA. To pull a cable and get it to a spile.\nQ. Yes. Next?\nA. And the fact the winches were dead, it is a very slow operation getting the cable out.\nQ. Yes?\nA. And also the amount of cable I would have had to put out to reach a spile would be a considerable heft.\nBy His Lordship:\nQ. A great weight, I suppose?\nA. A great weight, and would take a long time to pull it out there.\nQ. And other factor? Any other reason?\nA. Well, that is about all I know of.\nBy Mr. Towers:\nQ. How close was the nearest spile it could be put on?\nA. Oh it would be 125 or thirty feet from the line. By His Lordship:\nQ. From where?\nA. From the mooring cable that I had ready.\nBy Mr. Towers:\nQ. You don\u2019t mean that these piles are the ones that the mooring cable was to be put on?\nA. No. You couldn\u2019t put that on them, they were no good.\nQ. And the other one was no good?\nA. Yes; 65 or 70 feet from that.\nQ. Now you had this mooring cable ready and passed through the chock and lying on deck, you say?\nA. Correct.\nQ. How did you expect to manoeuvre the boat when you left your other berth?\nA. Well, I expected the tug would put us right to the dock and I would pass the eye of the cable on the dock.\nBy His Lordship:\nQ. You expected the tug to do what?\nA. To put the Paisley alongside of the dock.\nQ. Without any lines being thrown from your ship?\nA. Without throwing any heaving lines, yes, sir.\n* * * * *\nQ. When you did go forward, her stem then being a little south of the south wall of the elevator, what instructions did you then give to your three men?\nA. I came forward and went up on the forecastle and\u2014.Oh, there was a conversation; I don\u2019t remember anything definitely, only I do remember this: That I passed the remark: He has got us going pretty fast. He had better check us pretty soon now. It was more speaking my own mind out loud than anything else.\nPenrice says also, in another place, that he had two wire cables and two manilla lines, \u201cready to put ashore,\u201d and \u201cfor tying up the Paisley when she arrived at the dock.\u201d\nSykes was examined; he says nothing as to the possibility of putting a line ashore, except that \u201cIf we were close enough, we might have got a line ashore, and checked the vessel.\u201d Bechard says the tow was too far out. Holmes was also called, but he does not testify as to the distance at which the Paisley passed the elevator. His impression of the accident is naively summed up in the following answers. He had assisted Sykes in putting the towing line on the port bitts:\u2014\nQ. Then, after that what happened?\nA. Well, I couldn\u2019t just say.\nQ. How long a line was that? How long was it pulled up? After you put it on the port bitts what distance ahead did the tug go?\nA. Well, I couldn\u2019t exactly say that either.\nQ. Well, about how far?\nA. Well, I should say about a hundred feet. Q. And then what happened?\nA. Well, I think he backed up, if I am not mistaken, and while they was backing up they was trying to make for to bring the line up to the forward snubbing post on the tug and it busted.\nQ. The line busted?\nA. Yes, sir.\nQ. Then, where did the vessel go?\nA. I think the vessel went towards the amidships.\nQ. On what?\nA. Towards the amidships of the Paisley.\nQ. You mean the tug went?\nA. The tug.\nQ. Where did the Paisley go after the line bust?\nA. The Paisley went on ahead.\nQ. And where did she pull up?\nA. She pulled up against another boat.\nAs to the rate of speed at which the tug and tow passed up on their southwesterly course opposite to the elevator dock, there are various estimates by the observers, running from half a mile an hour to two or three miles, and there seems to be no doubt that it was involved in the operation, as designed by Captain Waugh, that, at some point beyond the elevator, he would cast off the tow-line from the tug\u2019s stern., carry it forward and make it fast at her bow, and, by reversing the tug and backing up on that line, check the speed of the tow, so as to enable him to push her into place by bringing the tug into contact with the side or bow of the ship; or, as described in the evidence, by \u201cnosing\u201d the ship into place, a manoeuvre which did not in any wise depend upon any action on the part of Penrice, or any of his men, in the way of landing a cable, to be made fast on the dock for the purpose of checking the Paisley\u2019s speed.\nThe trial judge finds for the plaintiffs, upon the ground that the tug and tow were jointly negligent, and he says,\nI accept the stories of Waugh and Mathewson that they got the bow of the Paisley within thirty feet of the dock, and that the course taken would throw the stern in, and I have no doubt that had those on her been ready, and proper arrangements made to have men at the dock to receive them, they could have got their lines out in time to have helped to check the steamer and, with the shoving of the tug, to safely dock her.\nNow, with all due respect for the learned judge\u2019s finding, and with full realization of the difficulties, if any, involved in the case, I am persuaded, upon the whole testimony and the attendant circumstances, that the judge is mistaken, both in his finding and in permitting that finding to influence his determination of the case. The evidence of Waugh and Mathewson, as to the distance of 30 feet, depends upon the assumption that the tug, after making fast to the forward port bitts of the Paisley, directed her course at a very broad angle to the face of the elevator dock, or towards the west shore of the harbour. It is not less than 175 feet from the north side of the elevator, to the place where, on the chart, Captain Waugh put the encircled cross, to which he says he headed the tug, and, if he did that, and continued in that direction, the tug would, of course, have been ashore long before the tow got within thirty feet of the dock, or any distance approximating to it. Therefore, if the tug, after shifting her line to the Paisley\u2019s bow, really set out upon the course which her captain says she did, she must immediately have swung consideralbly to the southward, because she seems to have passed the elevator dock with her tow about parallel with the dock, and on her course to collide with the Saskatchewan. Captain Waugh says he was immediately northeast of the elevator, when the Paisley\u2019s bow came within thirty feet of the dock, \u201cas closely as I could go or judge,\u201d but the Paisley was being brought to the elevator in order immediately to discharge her cargo, and the intention evidently was that she should lie with her starboard side to the dock, and under the leg of the elevator. Captain Waugh, with the interest which his owners had in the elevator, and his experience in towing vessels there, knew perfectly well what should be done, and he says, \u201cWe were supposed to put her right at the elevator and the suggestion that he anticipated that the ship-keeper would put his lines ashore from the ship\u2019s bow to the northward of the elevator, even if he could, is impossible to accept, especially when it is evident that Captain Waugh did not intend to cast off, reverse and nose the tow in, until he had reached the point beyond the elevator where that process was attempted, and failed. Moreover, Captain Waugh never gave any order or instruction for the handling of the lines, thus shewing, since he was in charge of the enterprise, that no action on the part of the tow was at the time expected or anticipated; and, indeed, it would have been a very imprudent and perhaps hazardous step on the part of the ship-keeper and those on the dock, without direction from the tug, to have attempted to check the speed of the tow while the tug was still deliberately moving her forward.\nPenrice seems fully to have realized that, if a line were to be put ashore from the ship, he would be the one to do it, and the elevator employees were on the dock for no other purpose than to receive and make fast the mooring cables when landed; but not one of them considered that the vessel was within reasonable distance for that; and it is most unlikely that any of these men, who were at the time responsible for the mooring, and not unaccustomed to that service, would be apt to misjudge the situation, which was perfectly simple\u2014unobstructed sea room, adequate tug power, an experienced master in absolute control, men at hand to execute his order. The idea of a long, flying shot, without orders, in the absence of any emergency, in the hope of checking the vessel before the tug had made known its plan and method of approach, and without any direction from the tug, can, I think, be suggested only to be rejected. It was when, in pursuance of the captain\u2019s project, he had cast loose from the tow and was endeavouring to move his tow-line to his forward bitts, and when it was discovered that the mate was having trouble with the lines, that Penrice, as \u00e2 forlorn hope, made the cast which fell on the piles at a distance of 75 feet from the ship, and where the line was 65 feet from the nearest snubbing post on the dock.\nThese are the facts and circumstances, as disclosed by the proof, and I can only regard the tug master\u2019s testimony as an effort on the part of the tug to excuse her own faulty navigation by alleging neglect of the tow to land her mooring lines; it is an excuse for which there is no justifiable foundation in fact. I cannot discern that, during the progress of the towing, the ship-keeper did or omitted to do anything which caused or contributed to the accident, and I see no reason to charge the owners of the Paisley with any fault relating to the navigation, after the Paisley was taken by the tug from her moorings.\nEven supposing that the tug did, at one stage of her progress, bring the bow of the Paisley, at a speed of one half mile an hour, to within 30 feet of the elevator dock, as the speed and distance are estimated by the tug master and his mate, that cannot, I think, be considered as completing the movement of the ship to the elevator, and it still remaind for the tug to bring the ship alongside, where she could be moored, and where her cargo could be discharged. Penrice, the ship-keeper, had no authority, either from his owners or from the tug, to exercise independent judgment as to anything concerned with the navigation, or as to when, so long as the ship was in charge of the tug, good seamanship required that he should cast a line or perform any service connected with the movement of the ship. He was not employed by the owners of the ship for that purpose, and he had no order or authority from the tug master. It certainly did not seem to him that the time had come for mooring, and the towing or moving to the dock had not been completed when the Paisley, on her southerly course, was passing the dock, even if her bow were, at one stage of that passage, only thirty feet from the dock.\nWith regard to the port anchor, there is no doubt that Penrice, on 15th January, when the tug master objected to the position to which he had raised the anchor in its hawse-pipe, encouraged Captain Waugh to leave it in the position in which it was at the time of the accident, and, perhaps, the Saskatchewan would not have sustained the damage which occurred, if the anchor had not been there, but the position of the anchor, if it were a fault, was not the fault of the owners of the Paisley; they had put the tug in charge, and their ship-keeper had no authority to direct the stowage of the anchors, for the purposes of the tug; and moreover the anchor did not cause or contribute to the collision, and its position does not create liability on the part of the owners, upon well-known principles, which were recently discussed in the case of Admiralty Commissioners v. S. S. Volute[1].\nFor similar reasons, the evidence as to the manner in which Penrice had placed or employed his three men upon the ship during the passage, for the purpose of providing facilities and expedition for the mooring of the vessel, at the elevator, does not affect the case, because, even if Penrice had actually complied with all the conditions which the plaintiffs suggest, it is obvious that the accident would nevertheless have occurred as and when it did. I do not consider, however, that the plaintiff has succeeded in attributing any fault to the ship-keeper or his men in this particular.\nIt may, I think, be fairly and safely assumed, having regard to all the evidence and the course of the trial, that the tug was competent to the service for which she was . engaged; and, upon this assumption, the owners of the Paisley were, in my view, justified in permitting their vessel to be moved from her moorings to the elevator, as they did, under the power, direction and control of the tug, and, being not otherwise guilty of any fault, have incurred no personal liability; but the question remains whether the ship itself has become liable to the plaintiffs for the damage which, in the circumstances, the latter sustained by reason of the negligence of the tug.\nNow it is evident that, in the towing of the Paisley, the governing and navigating authority was solely with the tug, and that the ship, in the condition in Which she was, had no power to assist in the operation, either in the way of furnishing power or of directing her course. It was not contended at the hearing that the tug was in any wise the servant of the tow. Neither the ship-keeper, nor the three men whom he had employed to assist on board and at the dock in the discharge of the vessel\u2019s cargo, had any authority or duties which were unfulfilled with regard to the navigation; the ship-keeper appears to have been prepared and willing to give effect, so far as possible, to any order which he might receive from the tug master, and all such orders were in fact duly executed; it is observable, too, in this connection, that, by the Harrison Company\u2019s letter of 11th December, the only service to be rendered by the ship-keeper for which the tug stipulated was to \u201cdirect the mooring of steamers after being unloaded.\u201d The case therefore falls within the rule stated by Fletcher Moulton, L.J., in The Devonshire[2], where he says, referring to the towing of barges or other craft of the like kind,\nIn such cases the tow has no control over those navigating the tug. The tug is in the position of an independent contractor who performs the service of towing the barge to its destination, and who chooses for himself how he shall perform that service. I can see no reason why the misconduct of such an independent contractor should be imputed to the innocent tow, who is, in fact, no party to the wrongful act. So to impute it would be inconsistent with the general principles of our common law, and I should decline to do so unless I found a well-settled principle of admiralty jurisprudence evidenced by a course of consistent decisions which required me to do so. When the decisions are examined, the contrary is found to be the case.\nAnd he proceeds to consider those decisions.\nIn Sturgis v. Boyer[3], an Admiralty action in rem, which originated in the United States District Court, Clifford, J., pronouncing the judgment, upon appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States, used the following language:\u2014\nCases arise, undoubtedly, when both the tow and the tug are jointly liable for the consequences of a collision; as when those in charge of the respective vessels jointly participate in their control and management, and the master or crew of both vessels are either deficient in skill, omit to take due care, or are guilty of negligence in their navigation. Other cases may well be imagined where the tow alone would be responsible; as when the tug is employed by the master or owners of the tow as the mere motive power to propel their vessels from one point to another, and both vessels are exclusively under the control, direction, and management, of the master and crew of the tow. * * * But whenever the tug, under the charge of her own master and crew, and in the usual and ordinary course of such an employment, undertakes to transport another vessel, which, for the time being, has neither her master nor crew on board, from one point to another, over waters where such accessory motive power is necessary or usually employed, she must be held responsible for the proper navigation of both vessels; * * * Assuming that the tug is a suitable vessel, properly manned and equipped for the undertaking, so that no degree of negligence can attach to the owners of the tow, on the ground that the motive power employed by them was in an unseaworthy condition, the tow, under the circumstances supposed, is no more responsible for the consequences of a collision than so much freight; and it is not perceived that it can make any difference in that behalf, that a part, or even the whole of the officers and crew of the tow are on board, provided it clearly appears that the tug was a seaworthy vessel properly manned and equipped for the enterprise * * *.\nThese passages are quoted and adopted by Butt, J., sitting with Sir James Hannan, in The Quickstep[4]; and in Marsden on Collisions at Sea, 8th ed., at p. 195, the learned author makes the following comments:\u2014\nThe extent of the liability of a shipowner for engaging an unseaworthy tug does not appear to have been fully considered in this country (as to liability for employing tugs of insufficient power, see The Bristol City[5]); in other respects this statement seems to be a correct exposition of the principles upon which the respective liabilities of tug and tow are to be determined.\nIf, as I conclude, the Paisley\u2019s owners were not guilty of any fault, it follows that they have not incurred any personal obligation. River Wear Commissioners v. Adam son[6], per Lord Blackburn; The Devonshire[7].\nIt is suggested, however, that a maritime lien nevertheless attaches to the tow, although innocent of any fault in itself, seeing that it was the instrument which, by reason of the tug\u2019s negligence, caused the injury. The cases were reviewed by Hill, J., in The Sylvan, Arrow[8]; but the question is, for the purposes of this appeal, in principle ruled against the plaintiff by the decisions of the Judicial Committee in The \u201cAmerican\u201d and The \u201cSyria\u201d[9], and particularly in the case of The \u201cUtopia\u201d[10]. In the latter case the judgment was pronounced by Sir Francis Jeune, who says, at p. 499:\u2014\nIt was suggested in argument that, as the action against the Utopia is an action in rem, the ship may be held liable, though there be no liability in the owners. Such contention appears to their Lordships to be contrary to principles of maritime law now well recognized. No doubt at the time of action brought, a ship may be made liable in an action in rem, though its then owners are not, because, by reason of the negligence of the owners, or their servants, causing a collision, a maritime lien on their vessel may have been established, and that lien binds the vessel in the hands of subsequent owners. But the foundation of the lien is the negligence of the owners or their servants at the time of the collision, and if that be not proved no lien comes into existence, and the ship is no more liable than any other property which the owners at the time of collision may have possessed. In the recent case of The Castlegate[11], in the House of Lords, language used by the present Master of the Rolls in the case of The Parlement Belge[12], which expresses the above view, was quoted with an approval which their Lordships desire to repeat.\nThe appeals should, in my opinion, be allowed, and the actions should in each case be dismissed, with costs.\nAppeals allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Galt, Gooderham & Towers.\nSolicitors for the respondent James Richardson & Sons, Limited: Casey Wood & Co.\nSolicitors for the respondent Canada Steamship Lines Limited: Rowell, Reid, Wright & McMillan.\n[1] [1922] A.C. 129.\n[2] [1912] P. 21, at p. 49.\n[3] (1860) 24 How., 110, at pp. 121-123.\n[4] (1890) 15 P.D. 196, at p. 201.\n[5] (1921) 37 T.L.R. 901.\n[6] (1877) 2 App. Cas. 743, at pp. 767, 768.\n[7] [1912] A.C. 634, at p. 647.\n[8] [1923] P. 220.\n[9] (1874) L.R. 6 P.C. 127.\n[10] [1893] A.C. 492.\n[11] [1893] A.C. 38, at p. 52.\n[12] (1880) 5 P.D. 197, at p. 218.\n",

Quinlan & Robertson Ltd., [1929] S.C.R. 385\nDate: 1929-02-05\nThe Montreal Light, Heat & Power Company (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nQuinlan & Robertson, Limited (Defendant) Respondent.\n1928: November 16; 1929: February 5.\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING\u2019S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nNegligence\u2014Crown\u2014Lease of property by the Crown\u2014Clause denying any claim by the lessee against \u201cHis Majesty, His servants or agents\u201d\u2014Contractor performing government work on leased property\u2014Damages suffered by the lessee\u2014Liability.\nThe respondent company entered into a contract with the Minister of Railways and Canals, as representing the Crown, for the enlargement of the Lachine Canal, near Montreal. The appellant company had obtained under a lease from the Government the right to lay and maintain a gas main across the solum of the canal. Clause 6 of the lease stipulated that, in the event of its gas main being from any cause injured, the appellant company was to have no claim or demand against \u201cHis Majesty, His servants or agents.\u201d During the execution of the contract, a break occurred in the gas main; and the appellant company claimed damages alleging negligence of the respondent company in dredging the bed of the canal.\nHeld, reversing the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Q.R. 44 K.B. 230), that the respondent company was not a \u201cservant\u201d or an \u201cagent\u201d within the contemplation of clause 6 of the lease and was therefore liable in damages. Kearney v. Oakes (18 Can. S.C.R. 148) foll.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, Surveyer J., and dismissing the appellant\u2019s action.\nThe material facts of the case are stated in the judgment now reported.\nAim\u00e9 Geofirion K.C. and O. S. Tyndale K.C. for the appellant.\nJ. L. Perron K.C. and J. H. Michaud for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDuff J.\u2014The appellant company appeals from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, dismissing an appeal from the judgment of Mr. Justice Surveyer, who dismissed the appellant\u2019s action and incidental demand, by which he claimed $15,000 odd, as damages alleged to have been suffered in consequence of a break in the company\u2019s gas main, where it crosses the solum of the Lachine Canal. The appellant company\u2019s right to lay and maintain the gas main was derived from a lease of the year 1910, from the Minister of Railways and Canals. In April, 1913, the gas main was lowered, as the result of correspondence between the appellant company and the Quebec Superintendent of Railways and Canals, in order to allow for the enlargement of the canal then projected. This work was begun in the spring of 1914, and in May of that year the appellant company delivered to the respondent company, which had contracted with the Government to do the work, a blue print showing the position of its main and electric conduits, in order to enable the respondent company to take the necessary precautions to avoid injuring them in the execution of its contract. On the 28th of May, 1914, the gas main was broken; with the result that the supply of gas in a considerable section of Montreal was interrupted and the appellant company incurred heavy damages. The appellant company alleges that this break was caused by the negligence of the respondent company in dredging the bed of the canal, as part of the contract work; and the issue arising out of this allegation was one of the issues presented in the action.\nThe appellant company\u2019s action was instituted in January, 1915. The respondent company in its defence, in addition to denying responsibility for the injury to the main upon the facts, set up and relied upon clause 6 of the above-mentioned lease. The tenor of clause 6 is that in the event of its gas main being from any cause injured, the appellant company is to have no claim or demand against His Majesty, His servants or agents, therefor. The respondent company alleged that, in executing the work contracted for, it was, under the terms of the contract, constituted the servant or agent of His Majesty, and is consequently exempt in virtue of clause 6 from all liability to indemnify the appellant company. To this defence effect is given, both by the learned trial judge and by the Court of King\u2019s Bench, who unanimously held that under the terms of the respondent company\u2019s contract the department was entitled to exercise such a degree of control over the manner of the execution of the work, as to bring the respondent company within the category of agents or servants. The appellant company attacks this position, first, by denying that, in point of law, the respondent company has a status to set up the stipulations of clause 6, and second, by denying that the respondent company is a servant or agent within the contemplation of that clause.\nOn the first-mentioned contention no opinion is expressed.\nThe clauses in the contract upon which the respondent company relies are clauses 5, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 22, 29, 34 and 36, the effect of which is, according to the respondent\u2019s contention, that it was merely constituted \u201ca workman and at most a foreman.\u201d By these clauses, the engineer is made sole judge of the work as to quantity and quality; the work is to be commenced, carried on, and prosecuted to completion by the contractor, in such manner and at such points and places as the engineer shall from time to time direct, and to his satisfaction. The contract repeatedly stipulates for direction and control by the engineer, for example in clauses 7 and 11, which require that all his orders and directions shall be properly and efficiently obeyed to his satisfaction. A competent foreman is to be kept on the ground, to receive the orders of the engineer, and this foreman may be discharged by him for incompetence or improper conduct; books, invoices and pay-lists are subject to inspection and control by the . engineer.\nIt was held by the learned trial judge that, His Majesty having thus retained supervision of the work to be performed by the contractor, the relation of master and servant or principal and agent was constituted by the contract. In the Court of King\u2019s Bench some stress is laid upon section 9 of 35 R.S.C., by which it is provided that the Minister shall direct the construction, maintenance and repair of canals, and that the public canals are to be under the Minister\u2019s management and control.\nIt should first be observed that when this contract is looked at as a whole, it has few of the badges of hire and lease of services. Paragraphs 1, 3, 30, 37 and 48 may be mentioned specifically, as shewing that what the respondent company undertook under its contract was to execute a given work and supply materials of quantity and character ascertained or to be ascertained, and not to hire its servants to the department. The stipulations which the respondent company affirms have the effect of imparting to the contract the character of a contract of hire of services are precisely those usually found in contracts for the construction of extensive works.\nIn this court the controversy, on this branch of the appeal, seems to be concluded by a previous d\u00e9cision, Kearney v. Oakes[2]. The defendants, the respondents in that case, had a contract with the Minister of Railways and Canals, by which they undertook to construct a branch line of the Intercolonial Railway at Dartmouth, N.S. One defence to the action was based upon section 109 of the Government Railway Act of 1881, which provided that \u201cno action shall be brought against any officer, employee or servant\u201d of the department, for anything done in virtue of his office, service or employment, except upon notice in writing. No notice had been given. Ritchie, C.J., who dissented, reviews carefully the provisions of the contract, which, as appears from that review, contained clauses corresponding to those now relied upon by the respondent company; in most cases, framed in identical terms, and in others, in equivalent terms. The majority of the court held that notwithstanding these provisions, the respondents were not officers, servants or employees of the department.\nThere is also the decision of the Court of Exchequer in Reedie v. The London and North Western Railway Co.[3]. It was there held that the presence in a contract of a clause reserving to a railway company the power of dismissing the contractor\u2019s servants for incompetence had not the effect of clothing the contractors themselves with the character of servants, or of making the railway company responsible for the acts of the contractor\u2019s servants.\nIn Kearney v. Oakes[4], the decision turned upon the question whether the respondents, having contracted to construct the branch railway, were acting as \u201cemployees\u201d of the Minister in entering upon the appellant\u2019s land for that purpose. Patterson J., who delivered the principal judgment of the majority, held that the word \u201cemployee,\u201d in section 109, was used in the sense of servant, and this he considered was decisive in favour of the respondents. That contractors, under such a contract, were not servants, he regarded as not susceptible of dispute. It does not appear to have been suggested, even by the dissentient minority, that, under such a contract, the contractors are servants in a sense which would make the owners of the railway responsible for their collateral acts of negligence.\nThis was a decision upon a contract of 1884, with the Minister of Railways and Canals, which, in all pertinent respects, appears to have been the same as that now before us. And the decision, pronounced in 1890, necessarily involves the point that contractors, under such a contract, are not servants or employees.\nWe have to construe a stipulation in an instrument of 1910 executed by the Minister of the same department, and to determine whether under the contract of 1913, also executed by the Minister of the same department, and expressed in terms equivalent to those of the contract of 1884, the contractors are \u201cservants\u201d or \u201cagents\u201d of His Majesty.\nWe should be taking liberties with the language selected by the parties to express their mutual stipulations, if, in pronouncing upon that question, we disregarded the decision or the judgments in Kearney v. Oakes[5].\nFor these reasons, in my opinion, the defence to which effect has been given in the courts below, cannot be sustained. The issues of fact have not been passed upon and, in pursuance of the intimation given on the argument, the case will be remitted to the Superior Court to be dealt with conformably to the decision of this court on the question of law.\nThe appellant company should have the costs of the appeals in the Court of King\u2019s Bench, and in this court. The costs of the abortive trial should abide the ultimate result of the litigation.\nAppeal allowed with cost.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Brown, Montgomery & McMichael.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Beaubien & Lamarche.\n[1] Q.R. 44 K.B. 230.\n[2] (1890) 18 Can.

Clich\u00e9, [1929] S.C.R. 390\nDate: 1929-02-05\nL\u00e9opold Grondin (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nVital Cliche (Defendant) Respondent\n1928: November 29; 1929: February 5.\nPresent: Anglin G.J.C. and Duff, Mignault, Rinfret and Lamont JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING\u2019S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nSale of land\u2014Deed with warranty of \u201cfranc et quitte\u201d\u2014Description of the lot\u2014Error as to the cadastral number\u2014Clear title\u2014Rights of the buyer\u2014Arts. 1065, 1607, 1535, 2098, 2172, 2173, 2176 C.C.\nThe respondent sold to the appellant, with warranty of franc et quitte, a lot of land erroneously described in the deed of sale as the northwest part of lot no. 107 instead of as lot no. 107a. The .appellant, alleging such error and also that the property was not clear of encumbrances, brought an action for the r\u00e9siliation of the sale and the reimbursement of the purchase price and damages.\nHeld that, seeing the stipulation of warranty of franc et quitte contained in the deed of sale, the appellant had the right to have a property free of all encumbrances that may appear in the entry books of the registry office (page blanche) and that, owing to encumbrances registered upon lot no. 107, the appellant had not a clear title to the property sold to him. But the Court gave the option to the respondent, upon condition of paying all costs, to rectify the titles and have them registered, a certificate of search to be filed with the registrar on or before the 1st of May, showing due performance of this obligation; and, in case of his failure to do so, the sale would be annulled and the purchase price reimbursed to the appellant.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, Letellier J. and dismissing the appellant\u2019s action.\nThe material facts of the case are fully stated in the judgment now reported.\nLouis Morin K.C. for the appellant.\nP. H. Bouffard K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nMignault J.\u2014L\u2019appelant, qui avait eu gain de cause en premi\u00e8re instance, se plaint d\u2019un jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi qui a renvoy\u00e9 son action contre l\u2019intim\u00e9. Les faits de la cause sont assez compliqu\u00e9s, et il vaut mieux les relater avant de discuter le m\u00e9rite de la demande de l\u2019appelant. Le 15 mars 1921, par acte pass\u00e9 devant Gosselin, notaire, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a vendu \u00e0 l\u2019appelant, avec la garantie de \u201cfranc et quitte une terre de trois arpents de front sur trente arpents de profondeur, situ\u00e9e en la concession Saint-Antoine sud-ouest, en la paroisse de Saint-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric de Beauce, laquelle terre fut d\u00e9crite par tenants et aboutissants, avec mention qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait la partie nord-ouest du lot n\u00b0 107 du cadastre de cette paroisse. L\u2019intim\u00e9 d\u00e9clara \u00e0 l\u2019acte que cet immeuble lui appartenait pour l\u2019avoir acquis de Hilaire Roseberry, suivant acte du 31 mai 1902 devant le m\u00eame notaire, d\u00fbment enregistr\u00e9 \u00e0 Beauce. La vente fut faite \u00e0 charge de la rente constitu\u00e9e seigneuriale et pour le prix de $5,000, lequel prix a \u00e9t\u00e9 depuis compl\u00e8tement pay\u00e9.\nCette terre appartenait originairement au p\u00e8re de l\u2019intim\u00e9, Richard Cliche, qui, le 30 octobre 1885, l\u2019a vendue \u00e0 Jean Roseberry pour $2,100, dont $500 \u00e0 payer \u00e0 Ephrem Jacques, $500 \u00e0 Thomas Lambert, et $1,100 payable au vendeur, \u00e0 termes. Richard Cliche \u00e9tait aussi propri\u00e9taire alors d\u2019un terrain voisin, au sud de la terre vendue.\nCette vente s\u2019est faite avant le cadastre de la paroisse de Saint-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric, qui est entr\u00e9 en vigueur le 25 f\u00e9vrier 1888. Autant qu\u2019on peut le constater, toute la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Richard Cliche, y compris le terrain voisin au sud, a re\u00e7u au cadastre le num\u00e9ro 107, et d\u00e8s ce moment les trois arpents par trente, dont il s\u2019agit en cette cause, devaient, d\u2019apr\u00e8s la loi, se d\u00e9crire comme la partie nord-ouest du lot 107. Il n\u2019est pas question dans cette cause du terrain voisin au sud, soit la partie sud-est du lot originaire 107 donn\u00e9e par Richard Cliche \u00e0 son fils, l\u2019intim\u00e9, le 16 f\u00e9vrier 1899, et vendue par ce dernier \u00e0 un tiers.\nPlus tard, par un amendement au cadastre, le lot originaire 107 fut subdivis\u00e9 en deux parties. La partie sud-est a conserv\u00e9 le num\u00e9ro 107 et la partie nord-ouest, savoir la terre que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a vendue \u00e0 l\u2019appelant, a re\u00e7u le num\u00e9ro 107A. Cet amendement au cadastre est entr\u00e9 en vigueur le 11 novembre 1890.\nCependant, malgr\u00e9 l\u2019amendement, on a continu\u00e9 dans les actes \u00e0 d\u00e9signer la terre de l\u2019appelant tant\u00f4t comme la partie nord-ouest du lot 107, c\u2019est ainsi que la d\u00e9crit la vente du 15 mars 1921, tant\u00f4t comme la moiti\u00e9 c\u00f4t\u00e9 nord du lot 107. Pareillement la partie sud-est de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 originaire de Richard Cliche est appel\u00e9e la moiti\u00e9 sud-est ou bien la moiti\u00e9 sud du lot 107, et cela sans \u00e9gard \u00e0 l\u2019amendement du cadastre. Il est \u00e9vident que les notaires n\u2019ont tenu aucun compte de la subdivision du lot 107, et c\u2019est leur n\u00e9gligence \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard qui a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 ce proc\u00e8s.\nLa premi\u00e8re vente de la terre en question, celle de Richard Cliche \u00e0 Jean Roseberry, \u00e9tant ant\u00e9rieure au cadastre, Richard Cliche, apr\u00e8s l\u2019entr\u00e9e en vigueur de ce cadastre, s\u2019est conform\u00e9 aux articles 2168 et 2172 du code civil en donnant au r\u00e9gistrateur un avis, enregistr\u00e9 le 22 f\u00e9vrier 1890, portant que cette terre \u00e9tait alors connue comme \u00e9tant la moiti\u00e9 nord-ouest du lot 107. A cette date-l\u00e0, cette d\u00e9signation \u00e9tait exacte, mais elle ne l\u2019\u00e9tait plus apr\u00e8s l\u2019entr\u00e9e en vigueur de l\u2019amendement au cadastre, le 11 novembre 1890.\nIl faut suivre maintenant cette terre depuis l\u2019achat qn\u2019en a fait Jean Roseberry, le 30 octobre 1885. Nous nous guiderons pour cela sur les constatations du certificat de recherches, ou \u00e9tat hypoth\u00e9caire, que les parties acceptent comme preuve du contenu des actes y mentionn\u00e9s.\nJean Roseberry est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 le 8 novembre 1893, instituant par son testament son \u00e9pouse, Archange Vachon, sa l\u00e9gataire universelle. Le 15 ao\u00fbt 1894, Archange Vachon a donn\u00e9 cette terre, d\u00e9sign\u00e9e comme \u201cla moiti\u00e9 c\u00f4t\u00e9 nord dudit lot 107\u201d, de m\u00eame qu\u2019un autre immeuble non d\u00e9crit, \u00e0 son fils Hilaire Roseberry. Cette donation comportait les charges suivantes: 1\u00b0 de payer les rentes constitu\u00e9es (probablement les rentes seigneuriales); 2\u00b0 de livrer \u00e0 sa s\u0153ur, Eug\u00e9nie Roseberry, certains meubles et de lui payer $300; 3\u00b0 d\u2019acquitter envers la donatrice une rente viag\u00e8re et alimentaire compos\u00e9e de diverses obligations mentionn\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019acte, et une rente annuelle de $150, s\u2019il y a lieu (l\u2019\u00e9tat hypoth\u00e9caire ne fait pas voir si cette rente annuelle de $150 rempla\u00e7ait la rente viag\u00e8re et alimentaire). Le donataire s\u2019est de plus oblig\u00e9 \u00e0 payer toutes les dettes tant hypoth\u00e9caires que chirographaires de la donatrice, et aussi \u00e0 acquitter\ntoutes les charges mentionn\u00e9es en faveur de Jean Roseberry, p\u00e8re du donataire, dans l\u2019acte de donation qu\u2019il a consenti \u00e0 feu Jean Roseberry, devant Legendre N.P., le 25 octobre 1869. Le tout sous hypoth\u00e8que des dits immeubles. Le 31 mai 1902, Hilaire Roseberry vendit \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 la terre en question en la d\u00e9crivant comme \u201cla partie nord-ouest dudit lot 107\u201d, \u00e0 la charge de la rente constitu\u00e9e seigneuriale et\npour le prix de $3,050, payable comme suit: $50 dans le cours de l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9; $500 au 1er novembre, prochain, * * * et la balance payable \u00e0 termes. Le tout sous l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que dudit immeuble.\nOn a enregistr\u00e9 de plus: un testament par Clara Poulin, l\u2019\u00e9ponse de l\u2019intim\u00e9, instituant ce dernier son l\u00e9gataire universel; une d\u00e9claration d\u2019h\u00e9r\u00e9dit\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9 exposant que Clara Poulin, son \u00e9pouse, est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e le 12 juillet 1919, et que parmi les biens transmis \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 par ce testament, \u201cse trouve ledit lot 107 et autre immeuble\u201d; un certificat du percepteur du revenu provincial du district de Beauce constatant qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de droits exigibles, re Suce Clara Poulin, \u201csur moiti\u00e9 indivise dudit lot 107\u201d (probablement Clara Poulin n\u2019avait que son droit comme commune en biens); la vente susmentionn\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appelant; enfin un avis par l\u2019intim\u00e9 que dans la d\u00e9claration d\u2019h\u00e9r\u00e9dit\u00e9 ci-dessus\nil y a eu erreur, que parmi les biens transmis se trouvait la moti\u00e9 indivise du dit lot 107, au lieu de tout le lot 107.\nProbablement, par moiti\u00e9 indivise, on voulait dire la moiti\u00e9 appartenant \u00e0 Clara Poulin comme commune en biens; car, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque du d\u00e9c\u00e8s de Clara Poulin, l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire de tout le lot originaire 107, mais, encore une fois, le notaire instrumentant n\u2019a tenu aucun compte de l\u2019amendement au cadastre.\nDe toutes les hypoth\u00e8ques mentionn\u00e9es au certificat de recherches, une seule, celle consentie par l\u2019appelant pour garantir le paiement de son prix de vente, para\u00eet avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 radi\u00e9e. Et ces hypoth\u00e8ques, \u00e0 l\u2019exception de celle cr\u00e9\u00e9e par la vente de Richard Cliche \u00e0 Jean Roseberry, sont toutes subs\u00e9quentes \u00e0 l\u2019entr\u00e9e en vigueur de l\u2019amendement au cadastre. Pour le cas au moins des charges mentionn\u00e9es \u00e0 son titre d\u2019acquisition, l\u2019intim\u00e9 sait si ces charges ont \u00e9t\u00e9 acquitt\u00e9es, et, si elles l\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9, il est en mesure, plus que personne, \u00e0 en faire faire la radiation.\nL\u2019appelant avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 acquitt\u00e9 son prix de vente lorsqu\u2019il d\u00e9couvrit l\u2019erreur de d\u00e9signation de l\u2019immeuble qu\u2019il avait achet\u00e9. Il mit alors l\u2019intim\u00e9 en demeure, par une lettre de son procureur en date du 4 d\u00e9cembre 1926, de lui donner un bon titre de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, de r\u00e9gulariser ses titres, et d\u2019en acqu\u00e9rir (sic), le tout \u00e0 ses frais et d\u00e9pens. L\u2019intim\u00e9 ne s\u2019\u00e9tant pas conform\u00e9 \u00e0 cette mise en demeure, l\u2019appelant institua une action contre lui, le 16 d\u00e9cembre 1926, concluant \u00e0 la r\u00e9siliation de la vente et r\u00e9clamant le remboursement du prix de vente, $5,000, et de plus $1,000 de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats. Dans sa d\u00e9claration, l\u2019appelant se dit pr\u00eat, cependant, mais sans pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 ses droits, \u00e0 suspendre son action pendant un mois, afin que l\u2019intim\u00e9 ait le temps n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9gulariser ses titres, de donner un bon titre \u00e0 l\u2019appelant, et de lib\u00e9rer l\u2019immeuble des hypoth\u00e8ques et privil\u00e8ges, et alors l\u2019appelant se d\u00e9clare pr\u00eat \u00e0 maintenir la vente, \u00e0 condition que l\u2019intim\u00e9 paie tous les frais.\nApr\u00e8s l\u2019institution de cette action, l\u2019appelant et l\u2019intim\u00e9 se rendirent devant le notaire Andr\u00e9 Taschereau, de St-Joseph de Beauce, et par un acte en date du 21 d\u00e9cembre 1926, produit au dossier, rectifi\u00e8rent l\u2019acte de vente du 15 mars 1921, en d\u00e9clarant que la description du terrain vendu par l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait erron\u00e9e,\net que ledit lot vendu \u00e9tait et est encore connu au cadastre de Saint-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric \u2018Comme \u00e9tant de lot cent sept A (107A), et les parties font ladite rectification pour valoir ce que de droit.\nCet acte de rectification fut enregistr\u00e9 sur le lot 107A, et les parties admettent que c\u2019est la seule entr\u00e9e au bureau d\u2019enregistrement au sujet de ce lot.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9, cependant, ne voulant pas faire davantage, l\u2019appelant continua son action que l\u2019intim\u00e9 contesta au fond. Le jugement de la cour sup\u00e9rieure (Letellier, J.) a maintenu les conclusions de l\u2019appelant quant \u00e0 la r\u00e9siliation de l\u2019acte de vente et au remboursement du prix, $5,000, mais il a accord\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 l\u2019option de rectifier tous les titres et de lib\u00e9rer la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de toutes les hypoth\u00e8ques et charges, pourvu qu\u2019il le f\u00eet dans le d\u00e9lai de deux mois \u00e0 compter de ce jugement.\nLa cour du Banc du Roi a infirm\u00e9 ce jugement, et l\u2019appelant nous demande de le r\u00e9tablir.\nUne consid\u00e9ration me para\u00eet dominer ce litige, c\u2019est que la vente dont il s\u2019agit comporte de la part du vendeur la garantie de franc et quitte. Cette modification de la garantie l\u00e9gale\u2014et les parties peuvent ajouter aux obligations que cette garantie impose au vendeur (art. 1507 C.C.)\u2014nous vient de l\u2019ancien droit, o\u00f9 l\u2019on enseignait que m\u00eame lorsque le vendeur fait la d\u00e9claration de franc et quitte de bonne foi (s\u2019il \u00e9tait de mauvaise foi, c\u2019\u00e9tait un stellionat), il n\u2019en est pas moins tenu civilement de faire d\u00e9charger les biens des hypoth\u00e8ques, ou de souffrir la r\u00e9siliation du contrat avec dommages et int\u00e9r\u00eats (Guyot, R\u00e9pertoire, vol. 7, p. 548, col. 2. Voyez aussi l\u2019opinion de Casault, J., dans Beaudette v. Cormier[1], et la d\u00e9cision du juge Davidson dans Millar v. Gohier[2]. Voyez encore Laurent, t. 24, n\u00b0 325; Hue, t. 10, n\u00b0 165 in fine, p. 228).\nIl est d\u2019ailleurs superflu d\u2019insister, car on lit dans le jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi le \u201cconsid\u00e9rant\u201d qui suit:\nConsid\u00e9rant que, vu la garantie de franc et quitte qui se trouve dans le titre d\u2019acquisition du demandeur, ce dernier a droit \u00e0 urne propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qu\u2019aucune charge ou hypoth\u00e8que n\u2019affecte dans les livres du bureau d\u2019enregistrement.\nEt le juge Tellier dit:\u2014\nA cause de la garantie de franc et quitte qui se trouve dans son titre d\u2019acquisition, le demandeur a droit \u00e0 une page blanche, ou libre de tout embarras, au bureau d\u2019enregistrement.\nLe m\u00eame savant juge a \u00e9galement expos\u00e9 la m\u00eame doctrine dans la cause de Langlois v. Chaput[3].\nL\u2019appelant a-t-il cette page blanche? je ne le crois pas.\nEt d\u2019abord le jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi, parlant de la vente du 30 octobre 1885, par Richard Cliche \u00e0 Jean Roseberry, dont l\u2019enregistrement a \u00e9t\u00e9 renouvel\u00e9 apr\u00e8s le cadastre, reconna\u00eet qu\u2019il y a l\u00e0 une cr\u00e9ance hypoth\u00e9caire pour balance du prix de vente de $2,100, rien ne d\u00e9montrant si cette cr\u00e9ance a \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9e, ou est encore due, et que l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que r\u00e9sultant de l\u2019enregistrement de l\u2019acte de vente ne para\u00eet pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 radi\u00e9e.\nIl y a aussi les charges stipul\u00e9es \u00e0 la donation du 15 ao\u00fbt 1894, par Archange Vachon \u00e0 Hilaire Roseberry, l\u2019auteur de l\u2019intim\u00e9. Il est vrai que la d\u00e9signation de l\u2019immeuble comme \u00e9tant \u201cla moiti\u00e9 c\u00f4t\u00e9 nord dudit lot 107\u201d est d\u00e9fectueuse, car alors le cadastre amend\u00e9 \u00e9tait en vigueur, mais quelle serait la position de l\u2019appelant si on demandait \u00e0 faire rectifier cette d\u00e9signation, en supposant que les charges de cette donation n\u2019aient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 acquitt\u00e9es?\nOn peut en dire autant de l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que cr\u00e9\u00e9e par la vente de Hilaire Roseberry \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9. Rien ne d\u00e9montre au bureau d\u2019enregistrement que le prix d\u2019acquisition ait \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9. La Cour du Banc du Roi, qui para\u00eet avoir reconnu que l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas la page blanche \u00e0 laquelle il a droit, a n\u00e9anmoins \u00e9cart\u00e9 son action pour deux raisons que nous croyons mal fond\u00e9es.\nLa premi\u00e8re raison, c\u2019est que la comparution de l\u2019appelant \u00e0 l\u2019acte de rectification par lequel son titre d\u2019acquisition a \u00e9t\u00e9 corrig\u00e9, et son acceptation de cet acte, sans aucune restriction ni r\u00e9serve, comportent de sa part un abandon ou d\u00e9sistement de sa demande en r\u00e9solution, vu qu\u2019il y a incompatibilit\u00e9 absolue entre cette demande et ledit acte de rectification.\nIl me para\u00eet impossible de soutenir que l\u2019acceptation de cet acte de rectification comporte abandon par l\u2019appelant du droit d\u2019obtenir la radiation des entr\u00e9es qui paraissent au bureau d\u2019enregistrement. Nul n\u2019est cens\u00e9 renoncer \u00e0 un droit, et il semble \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire d\u2019ajouter que, pour valoir, une renonciation doit \u00eatre non \u00e9quivoque. Du reste, il n\u2019y a certainement pas incompatibilit\u00e9 entre la demande et un acte de rectification qui n\u2019a satisfait qu\u2019\u00e0 un seul des chefs de cette demande. Autant vaudrait dire que l\u2019intim\u00e9, en signant l\u2019acte de rectification, aurait renonc\u00e9 au droit de contester les autres conclusions de l\u2019action qui \u00e9tait alors pendante. Cette raison para\u00eet donc d\u00e9nu\u00e9e de fondement.\nL\u2019autre raison est une fin de non-recevoir, dit l\u2019appelant, que la Cour du Banc du Roi a d\u2019office oppos\u00e9e \u00e0 sa demande, sans que l\u2019intim\u00e9 l\u2019e\u00fbt en aucune fa\u00e7on invoqu\u00e9e. Il appert \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tat hypoth\u00e9caire que, subs\u00e9quemment \u00e0 son acquisition, l\u2019appelant a hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9 l\u2019immeuble pour garantir un pr\u00eat de $1,400. Or, dit la Cour du Banc du Roi, l\u2019appelant n\u2019est pas en position de rendre cet immeuble \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 dans le m\u00eame \u00e9tat qu\u2019il l\u2019a re\u00e7u de ce dernier (art. 1065 C.C.).\nCependant, l\u2019appelant, dans son factum devant nous, dit que si l\u2019intim\u00e9 e\u00fbt invoqu\u00e9 ce moyen, il aurait pu faire voir que ce pr\u00eat avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rembours\u00e9 A l\u2019audition, il avait la quittance du pr\u00eat et il l\u2019a exhib\u00e9e en cour. Il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire, cependant, de lui accorder la permission de produire cette quittance au dossier, car l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9, ni dans son factum, ni dans sa plaidoirie orale, n\u2019a invoqu\u00e9 le moyen sur lequel la Cour du Banc du Roi s\u2019est bas\u00e9e. Il a pris connaissance de la quittance \u00e0 l\u2019audition, et il n\u2019a jamais pr\u00e9tendu que le pr\u00eat en question n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 rembours\u00e9. Il faut donc ne tenir aucun compte de la deuxi\u00e8me raison de la Cour du Banc du Roi.\nNe pouvant faire valoir ni Tune ni l\u2019autre de ces raisons, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9, \u00e0 l\u2019audition, a pr\u00e9tendu que toutes les charges qui paraissent \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tat hypoth\u00e9caire sont maintenant non avenues parce que leur enregistrement n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 renouvel\u00e9 au d\u00e9sir de l\u2019art. 2172 C.C.\nIl faut remarquer que toutes les charges non radi\u00e9es qui apparaissent \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tat hypoth\u00e9caire ou certificat de recherches ne sont pas dans la m\u00eame situation.\nLes charges cr\u00e9\u00e9es par la donation d\u2019Archange Vachon \u00e0 Hilaire Roseberry ainsi que par la vente d\u2019Hilaire Roseberry \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 sont subs\u00e9quentes au cadastre et \u00e0 son amendement. Pour elles, la question du renouvellement de l\u2019enregistrement ne peut se soulever, mais l\u2019immeuble hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9 est par erreur d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00eatre dans un cas \u201cla moiti\u00e9 nord\u201d, et dans l\u2019autre cas \u201cla moiti\u00e9 nord-ouest\u201d du lot 107, alors que c\u2019\u00e9tait le lot 107A qu\u2019il aurait fallu dire. Cette erreur (on peut m\u00eame dire qu\u2019il y a eu, dans toutes les transactions qui paraissent \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tat hypoth\u00e9caire, erreur commune) peut-elle se corriger maintenant? Je ne crois pas que nous devrions nous prononcer sur ce point, car notre jugement pourrait affecter les droits de tiers qui ne sont pas devant nous. Et s\u2019il y a nullit\u00e9 de l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que par suite de cette erreur, n\u2019est-ce pas \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9battre cette question avec les cr\u00e9anciers de ces charges, car il a garanti que l\u2019immeuble \u00e9tait franc et quitte?\nL\u2019enregistrement des charges cr\u00e9\u00e9es par la vente de Richard Cliche \u00e0 Jean Roseberry (ant\u00e9rieure au cadastre) a \u00e9t\u00e9 renouvel\u00e9 une fois apr\u00e8s l\u2019entr\u00e9e en vigueur du cadastre, mais il n\u2019y a pas eu un autre renouvellement apr\u00e8s l\u2019amendement du cadastre. Le d\u00e9faut de ce dernier renouvellement annule-t-il l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que par application des articles 2172, 2173, 2176 du code civil que l\u2019intim\u00e9 invoque? C\u2019est encore une question \u00e0 d\u00e9battre entre l\u2019intim\u00e9 garant et les cr\u00e9anciers; la r\u00e9soudre dans ce proc\u00e8s serait, si l\u2019intim\u00e9 a raison, affecter les droits de tiers qui ne sont pas en cause.\nM\u00eame sous l\u2019empire de l\u2019article 1535 du code civil, on d\u00e9cide que ce n\u2019est pas \u00e0 l\u2019acqu\u00e9reur \u00e0 discuter si une charge qui appara\u00eet au bureau d\u2019enregistrement existe r\u00e9ellement, mais le seul fait de l\u2019inscription hypoth\u00e9caire suffit pour lui ouvrir le recours de cet article.\nAinsi, dans la cause de Parker v. Felton[4], cour d\u2019appel, le juge-en-chef Dorion disait:\u2014\nThis court has already decided in the case of Jobin v. Shuter[5], that the buyer was not obliged to establish a clear right of action against the property purchased, nor to assume the risk of a lawsuit. It was sufficient if there appeared a reasonable cause of trouble. Now it has been repeatedly held in France that the existence of inscriptions hypoth\u00e9caires was a sufficient cause of trouble to entitle the purchaser to retain the price of sale * * * and this jurisprudence has always been followed here.\nVoy. aussi Malb\u0153uf v. Leduc[6], cour de revision.\nS\u2019il en est ainsi sous l\u2019article 1535 C.C., \u00e0 plus forte raison doit-il en \u00eatre de m\u00eame lorsque la vente est faite avec la clause de franc et quitte (voy. les autorit\u00e9s cit\u00e9es plus haut), car l\u2019article 1535 CC n\u2019envisage que le cas de garantie ordinaire.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9 dit encore que l\u2019appelant a la jouissance paisible de cette terre et que personne ne le trouble. Ce n\u2019est pas une raison pour ne pas donner effet \u00e0 la clause de franc et quitte. Si l\u2019appelant a la jouissance paisible de cette terre, peut-on dire qu\u2019il en a un titre indiscutable qui lui permette d\u2019en disposer, ou d\u2019emprunter en l\u2019hypoth\u00e9quant?\nUn dernier argument de l\u2019intim\u00e9, c\u2019est que l\u2019appelant ayant pay\u00e9 son prix n\u2019a aucun recours contre lui tant qu\u2019il ne sera pas \u00e9vinc\u00e9. Cet argument serait bien fond\u00e9 si nous nous trouvions dans l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se pr\u00e9vue par l\u2019article 1535 C.C. Mais il est certain que dans le cas de la garantie de franc et quitte, l\u2019acheteur peut demander l\u2019annulation de la vente si l\u2019immeuble n\u2019est pas franc et quitte, et n\u2019est pas oblig\u00e9 d\u2019exercer le recours de l\u2019article 1535 C.C. Je renvoie ici aux autorit\u00e9s cit\u00e9es plus haut.\nIl me para\u00eet indiscutable que l\u2019intim\u00e9 doit faire enregistrer son titre d\u2019acquisition sur le lot 107A pour permettre \u00e0 l\u2019appelant d\u2019enregistrer le sien (art. 2098 C.C).\nMa conclusion est de maintenir l\u2019appel avec les d\u00e9pens de toutes les cours contre l\u2019intim\u00e9. L\u2019appelant a droit \u00e0 un jugement r\u00e9siliant la vente du 15 mars 1921 et condamnant l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 lui rembourser le prix de vente, $5,000, avec int\u00e9r\u00eat de la date de ce jugement. Je n\u2019accorderais pas l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 compter de l\u2019institution de l\u2019action, car, pendant le proc\u00e8s, l\u2019appelant a eu la jouissance de la terre. Sur paiement de cette somme, rappelant devra r\u00e9troc\u00e9der cette terre \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9, aux frais de ce dernier, libre de toute charge qui proc\u00e9derait de son chef, et l\u2019acte de rectification du 21 d\u00e9cembre 1926 et son enregistrement seront alors non avenus.\nCependant la cour sup\u00e9rieure ayant donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 l\u2019option de faire rectifier tous les titres et de faire dispara\u00eetre toutes les hypoth\u00e8ques et charges sur l\u2019immeuble, et d\u2019\u00e9viter ainsi la r\u00e9siliation de la vente et l\u2019obligation de rembourser le prix, je suis d\u2019opinion, \u00e0 titre d\u2019indulgence, d\u2019accorder cette option \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 aux conditions suivantes:\nDans un d\u00e9lai de 15 jours de ce jugement l\u2019intim\u00e9 devra, par une d\u00e9claration d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au greffe de cette cour, et dont copie sera signifi\u00e9e au procureur de l\u2019appelant, dire s\u2019il entend accepter cette option.\nDans les 15 jours de l\u2019acceptation de l\u2019option, l\u2019intim\u00e9 devra payer au procureur de l\u2019appelant ses frais taxables dans toutes les cours.\nSi l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019accepte pas cette option ou si, l\u2019ayant accept\u00e9e, il ne paie pas les frais dans le d\u00e9lai susdit, il y aura jugement r\u00e9siliant la vente et condamnant l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 rembourser le prix, $5,000, avec int\u00e9r\u00eat tel que susdit, et les frais de toutes les cours.\nAu cas d\u2019acceptation de l\u2019option et du paiement des frais, cette cause restera ajourn\u00e9e au premier jour de mai prochain, et l\u2019intim\u00e9 proc\u00e8dera avec toute diligence possible \u00e0 faire rectifier tous les titres depuis, et y compris, la vente de Richard Cliche \u00e0 Jean Roseberry jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la vente par Hilaire Roseberry \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 inclusivement, en faisant corriger la d\u00e9signation erron\u00e9e qui s\u2019y trouve, et, apr\u00e8s correction, il fera enregistrer tous ces titres sur le num\u00e9ro 107A. De plus, il fera radier au bureau d\u2019enregistrement toutes les charges et hypoth\u00e8ques qui apparaissent au certificat de recherches comme affectant la terre qu\u2019il a vendue \u00e0 l\u2019appelant. Au premier jour de mai, ou \u00e0 toute date ult\u00e9rieure que la cour, pour cause suffisante, pourra fixer \u00e0 la demande de l\u2019intim\u00e9, ce dernier devra produire au greffe de cette cour un certificat de recherches constatant l\u2019accomplissement de ces conditions.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Morin & V\u00e9zina.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Bouffard & Bouffard.\n[1] [1890] 16 Q.L.R. 69, at p. 71.\n[2] [1901] 7 R. de J. 396.\n[3] [1921] Q.R. 32 K.B. 178, at p. 196.\n[4] [1877] 21 L.C.J. 253, at p. 255.\n[5] [1876] 21 L.C.J. 67.\n[6] [1900] Q.R. 19 S.C. 67.\n",

La d\u00e9claration all\u00e8gue, mais ne reproduit pas, le jugement de la Nouvelle-Ecosse. Elle se contente de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer \u00e0 l\u2019exemplification de ce jugement qui fut mise au greffe du tribunal, comme exhibit, en m\u00eame temps que furent produits le bref et l\u2019exploit d\u2019assignation (Arts. 151-155 C.P.C.). Elle all\u00e8gue, en outre, que devant la cour de la Nouvelle-Ecosse l\u2019appelant a comparu, a li\u00e9 contestation et que le jugement y fut rendu apr\u00e8s enqu\u00eate et audition de part et d\u2019autre. Cette derni\u00e8re affirmation appara\u00eet au jugement lui-m\u00eame; et, d\u2019ailleurs, elle n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9e.\nDevant la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, Rabinovitch comparut et fit motion pour que Chechik re\u00e7\u00fbt l\u2019ordre\nto produce the original or an authentic copy of the record in the said case no. 5908 of the records of the Supreme Court for the province of Nova Scotia in the city of Halifax in the said province, wherein the present plaintiff is plaintiff and the present defendant is defendant.\nCette motion fut accord\u00e9e et Chechik s\u2019y conforma en d\u00e9posant au greffe tous les documents du dossier de la Nouvelle-Ecosse.\nRabinovitch produisit alors une d\u00e9fense et une demande reconventionnelle. . Chechik plaida en droit, par voie d\u2019inscription, \u00e0 la d\u00e9fense et \u00e0 la demande reconventionnelle.\nLe juge de premi\u00e8re instance a laiss\u00e9 en suspens l\u2019inscription en droit \u00e0 rencontre de la d\u00e9fense, mais il a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019inscription en droit \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la demande reconventionnelle, en d\u00e9clarant qu\u2019il s\u2019appuyait sur les articles 211 et 212 du code de proc\u00e9dure civile et sur l\u2019arr\u00eat re Knox v. Lingle rendu par la Cour du Banc du Roi[2] et confirm\u00e9 par la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada[3].\nLa Cour du Banc du Roi a infirm\u00e9 ce jugement en donnant pour motifs que l\u2019arr\u00eat re Lingle v. Knox3 n\u2019avait pas d\u2019application en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, que la demande reconventionnelle n\u2019\u00e9tait qu\u2019une r\u00e9p\u00e9tition de la contestation qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 produite devant la cour de la Nouvelle-Ecosse et que l\u2019inscription en droit qui en demandait le rejet \u00e9tait donc bien fond\u00e9e et devait \u00eatre maintenue.\nRabinovitch se pourvoit maintenant en appel devant cette cour en niant l\u2019identit\u00e9 de la contestation dans la cause de la Nouvelle-Ecosse et dans celle de Qu\u00e9bec et en pr\u00e9tendant, \u00e0 tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, que les raisons invoqu\u00e9es par Chechik ne pouvaient faire l\u2019objet, d\u2019une inscription en droit parce que les faits sur lesquels elles s\u2019appuyaient n\u2019apparaissaient pas dans la d\u00e9claration elle-m\u00eame et que la Cour du Banc du Roi les a trouv\u00e9s dans les documents qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 produits au soutien de cette d\u00e9claration, ce qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas le droit de faire.\nNous n\u2019entendons nous occuper de cette cause que pour voir si un principe de justice a \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9 par le jugement qui nous est soumis et si l\u2019arr\u00eat concordant rendu par la Cour du Banc du Roi et par cette cour dans la cause de Lingle v. Knox (2) contredit le jugement dont il y a maintenant appel; car, pour le reste, il s\u2019agit d\u2019une question de proc\u00e9dure dans laquelle nous consid\u00e9rons que la d\u00e9cision du plus haut tribunal de la province de Qu\u00e9bec doit \u00eatre respect\u00e9e.\nCette province accorde la finalit\u00e9 aux jugements rendus dans les autres provinces du Canada lorsqu\u2019il y a eu \u201cassignation personnelle\u201d, ou si le d\u00e9fendeur \u201ca comparu lors de l\u2019action originaire\u201d (arts. 211 et 212 C.P.C.). Voici comment se lisent ces articles:\n211. La d\u00e9fense qui aurait pu \u00eatre faite \u00e0 rencontre de l\u2019action originaire, peut \u00eatre oppos\u00e9e \u00e0 la poursuite bas\u00e9e sur un jugement rendu dans une autre province du Canada, s\u2019il n\u2019y a pas eu d\u2019assignation personnelle dans cette province ou s\u2019il n\u2019y a pas eu de comparution du d\u00e9fendeur.\n212. Semblable d\u00e9fense ne peut \u00eatre faite, si le d\u00e9fendeur a \u00e9t\u00e9 assign\u00e9 personellement dans cette province, ou s\u2019il a comparu lors de l\u2019action originaire, sauf dans les cas o\u00f9 il s\u2019agit de d\u00e9cider d\u2019un droit affectant un immeuble situ\u00e9 dans cette province, ou de la juridiction d\u2019une cour \u00e9trang\u00e8re concernant ce droit.\nIl ne s\u2019agit pas ici\nde d\u00e9cider d\u2019un droit affectant un immeuble situ\u00e9 dans cette province ou de la juridiction d\u2019une cour \u00e9trang\u00e8re concernant ce droit.\nIl reste donc seulement \u00e0 s\u2019enqu\u00e9rir si la demande reconventionnelle contre laquelle Chechik a inscrit en droit est une\nd\u00e9fense qui aurait pu \u00eatre faite \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019action originaire.\nSi cette condition existe, il y avait lieu \u00e0 inscription en droit, d\u2019apr\u00e8s les termes m\u00eames de l\u2019article 212 C.P.C. \u201cSemblable d\u00e9fense ne peut \u00eatre faite\u201d ici parceque Rabinovitch \u201ca comparu lors de l\u2019action originaire\u201d. Il s\u2019agit bien alors purement et simplement d\u2019une question de droit: la d\u00e9fense, dans ce cas, ne peut plus \u00eatre faite; Rabinovitch n\u2019a pas le droit de produire telle d\u00e9fense. \u00c0 la vue de la d\u00e9claration, des documents produits, et surtout des jugements rendus par la cour de la Nouvelle-Ecosse, il est absolument \u00e9vident que la contestation que Rabinovitch pr\u00e9tend engager au moyen de sa demande reconventionnelle est exactement la m\u00eame que celle qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9battue en Nouvelle-Ecosse.\nL\u2019instance originaire \u00e9tait une action pro socio o\u00f9 Chechik demandait:\n(a) That the partnerships existing between Plaintiff and Defendant be dissolved and decreed to be at an end.\n(b) The appointment of a receiver of the real and personal property and assets of the partnership.\n(c) An accounting of the partnership dealings between the Plaintiff and Defendant, and a winding-up of the affairs of the partnership.\nApr\u00e8s enqu\u00eate et audition des parties, la Cour de la Nouvelle-Ecosse a rendu un jugement pr\u00e9liminaire\n7. That an account be taken by said Charles F. Tremaine, special referee, of all dealings and transactions of defendant with or concerning or relating to the partnerships between the plaintiff and defendant from 1st of August, A.D. 1919, down to the commencement of this action, and of dealings and transactions between the plaintiff and defendant during the same period; and that what, upon the taking of such account, shall be due from either of the parties to the other of them, shall be certified by said special referee.\n8. That the said referee shall have the same powers as the judge or a court in the conduct of proceedings before him, including, without restriction to the generality of the foregoing, the power to subpoena witnesses for attendance before him, with or without documents, etc.; to issue commissions, etc., for the examination of witnesses abroad; to rule on all questions of evidence; to proceed to any place or places in or out of the province of Nova Scotia to hear evidence, and in all things in connection with this action and the issues and accounts referred to him for inquiry and report, to have the same powers as could or might be exercised by the court or a judge.\nLe \u201cspecial referee\u201d, apr\u00e8s avoir accompli ce qui lui \u00e9tait ordonn\u00e9 par ce jugement, fit un rapport \u00e0 la suite de quoi le jugement final fut rendu d\u00e9clarant\nthat the partnerships at any time existing between the plaintiff and defendant are, and each of them is, dissolved;\net, comme cons\u00e9quence du rapport du \u201creferee\u201d, Rabinovitch fut condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 payer \u00e0 Chechik $309,229.99 repr\u00e9sentant le solde qu\u2019il lui devait \u00e0 la suite du d\u00e9bat de compte.\nCe jugement et ce rapport portaient sur toutes les transactions des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s qui ont exist\u00e9 entre Rabinovitch et Chechik depuis le 1er ao\u00fbt 1919 jusqu\u2019au 28 juin 1924. Ce sont exactement les m\u00eames transactions que Rabino- vitch entend remettre en question et au sujet desquelles il pr\u00e9tend rouvrir les d\u00e9bats de compte au moyen de la demande reconventionnelle qu\u2019il produit maintenant. Il est donc clair que la contestation qu\u2019il veut soulever est absolument la m\u00eame que celle qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9e par la cour de la Nouvelle-Ecosse.\nIl n\u2019est m\u00eame pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019aller aussi loin; et il suffirait de se demander si la contestation offerte par cette demande reconventionnelle est celle \u201cqui aurait pu \u00eatre faite \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019action originaire\u201d, car c\u2019est l\u00e0 tout ce que les articles 211 et 212 du code de proc\u00e9dure exigent.\nNous constatons que le litige en Nouvelle-Ecosse \u00e9tait une action pro socio o\u00f9 les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s existant entre les parties ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9es dissoutes et des d\u00e9bats de comptes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ordonn\u00e9s pour liquider et fixer l\u2019avoir de chacune des parties. Il s\u2019ensuit que c\u2019est lors de ces d\u00e9bats de comptes que Rabinovitch aurait d\u00fb faire valoir les moyens qu\u2019il invoque maintenant dans sa demande reconventionnelle. Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de constater s\u2019il l\u2019a fait, mais simplement de savoir s\u2019il aurait pu le faire. La Cour du Banc du Roi a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans l\u2019affirmative et nous sommes en tous points de son avis.\nLa question est diff\u00e9rente de celle qui s\u2019est pos\u00e9e dans la cause de Lingle v. Knox[4].\nLe pr\u00e9sent litige exige une interpr\u00e9tation des articles 211 et 212 du code de proc\u00e9dure. Lingle v. Knox4 comportait plut\u00f4t une interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019article 217 C.P.C. Il s\u2019agissait l\u00e0 d\u2019une action bas\u00e9e sur un jugement rendu dans la province de la Colombie-Britannique. Knox Brothers, sans produire de d\u00e9fense, offraient \u00e0 rencontre de la demande principale une demande reconventionnelle r\u00e9clamant compensation judiciaire pour une somme sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 celle de la demande principale.\nLingle, feignant d\u2019ignorer la demande reconventionnelle, avait inscrit ex parte pour jugement sur la demande principale. La Cour Sup\u00e9rieure condamna Knox Brothers par d\u00e9faut de plaider \u00e0 payer \u00e0 Lingle la somme r\u00e9clam\u00e9e, sans tenir aucun compte de la demande reconventionnelle \u201cdont elle ne para\u00eet pas avoir soup\u00e7onn\u00e9 l\u2019existence\u201d. On peut voir par les notes des juges de la Cour du Banc du Roi que la principale question qui s\u2019est d\u00e9battue a \u00e9t\u00e9 de savoir si la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure avait le droit de rendre jugement pari d\u00e9faut de plaider sans prendre en consid\u00e9ration la demande reconventionnelle. Par l\u00e0, la cour fut amen\u00e9e \u00e0 d\u00e9cider la port\u00e9e de l\u2019article 217 du code de proc\u00e9dure, qui se lit comme suit:\n217. Le d\u00e9fendeur peut exercer par demande reconventionnelle toute r\u00e9clamation qui r\u00e9sulte en sa faveur de la m\u00eame source que l\u2019action principale, et qu\u2019il ne peut faire valoir par d\u00e9fense.\nDans le cas o\u00f9 la demande principale tend \u00e0 une condamnation en deniers, le d\u00e9fendeur peut aussi former une demande reconventionnelle pour une r\u00e9clamation de deniers qu\u2019il peut avoir r\u00e9sultant d\u2019autres causes; mais cette demande reconventionnelle est distincte de l\u2019action principale et ne peut la retarder.\nLorsque le tribunal adjuge sur les deux demandes en m\u00eame temps, il peut d\u00e9clarer qu\u2019il y a compensation.\nLa demande reconventionnelle produite par Knox Brothers, d\u2019apr\u00e8s le rapport de l\u2019arr\u00eat, \u00e9tait une r\u00e9clamation qui r\u00e9sultait en leur faveur \u201cde la m\u00eame source que l\u2019action principale\u201d. Il fallait donc d\u00e9cider si une r\u00e9clamation de ce genre incorpor\u00e9e dans une demande reconventionnelle retardait l\u2019action principale. La Cour du Banc du Roi fut d\u2019avis que seule, en vertu de l\u2019article 217 C.P.C., la \u201cdemande reconventionnelle pour une r\u00e9clamation de deniers * * * r\u00e9sultant d\u2019autres causes\u201d est distincte de l\u2019action principale et ne peut la retarder. Elle d\u00e9cida que cette prescription, qui se trouve seulement dans le deuxi\u00e8me paragraphe de l\u2019article, ne s\u2019applique pas \u00e0 la demande reconventionnelle pr\u00e9vue par le premier paragraphe, lequel a trait \u00e0 une r\u00e9clamation r\u00e9sultant de \u201cla m\u00eame source que l\u2019action principale\u201d. (Lepitre v. The King[5], International Land & Lumber Company v. Martel[6]. Il s\u2019ensuivait que, d\u2019apr\u00e8s le sens de l\u2019article 217 C.P.C., une demande reconventionnelle contenant une r\u00e9clamation qui r\u00e9sulte de la m\u00eame source que l\u2019action principale retarde cette action, et que la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure n\u2019aurait pas d\u00fb rendre jugement sur l\u2019action principale de Lingle sans tenir aucun compte de la demande reconventionnelle de Knox Brothers.\nC\u2019est ce qui ressort absolument du jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi, qui n\u2019est pas reproduit dans le rapport de cette cause[7] et qui se lit en partie comme suit: Consid\u00e9rant que l\u2019appelante par sa demande reconventionnelle, r\u00e9clamant des dommages des intim\u00e9s par suite de l\u2019inex\u00e9cution par les intim\u00e9s de leurs obligations de vendeurs, exerce aux termes de l\u2019article 217 C.P. \u201cune r\u00e9clamation de la m\u00eame source que l\u2019action principale\u201d laquelle l\u2019appelante ne pouvait faire valoir par d\u00e9fense, suivant les r\u00e8gles de notre droit civil, qui n\u2019admet la compensation l\u00e9gale que dans les cas o\u00f9 la r\u00e9clamation oppos\u00e9e en compensation est claire et liquide;\nConsid\u00e9rant que les intim\u00e9s au lieu de lier contestation avec l\u2019appelante sur le m\u00e9rite de cette demande reconventionnelle l\u2019ont ignor\u00e9e, en inscrivant purement et simplement la cause pour jugement ex parte sur la demande principale et que le tribunal pareillement en ne rendant jugement que sur l\u2019action principale a ignor\u00e9 la demande reconventionelle dont il ne para\u00eet pas avoir soup\u00e7onn\u00e9 l\u2019existence, d\u2019o\u00f9 il est r\u00e9sult\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019a, statu\u00e9 que sur une partie du litige, privant ainsi l\u2019appelante de son droit d\u2019\u00eatre entendue sur sa demande reconventionnelle en m\u00eame temps que les intim\u00e9s seraient entendus sur leur action principale, afin de faire prononcer la compensation judiciaire par elle r\u00e9clam\u00e9e au cas o\u00f9 les all\u00e9gations de la demande reconventionnelle seraient prouv\u00e9es.\nC\u2019est ce jugement qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 par la Cour Supr\u00eame, qui fut d\u2019avis que le texte de l\u2019article 217 C.P.C. seems clearly to be open to the interpretation adopted by the Court of King\u2019s Bench; and, on the whole, there appears to be no solid ground for differing from this view.\nLa discussion sur la nature de la demande reconventionnelle produite par Knox Brothers, dans les notes des juges, n\u2019\u00e9tait pas tant pour d\u00e9cider si une demande reconventionnelle peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme rentrant dans la cat\u00e9gorie des d\u00e9fenses \u201cqui auraient pu \u00eatre faites \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019action originaire\u201d, au sens des articles 211 et 212 du code de proc\u00e9dure, que pour savoir s\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une demande reconventionnelle \u201cr\u00e9sultant de la m\u00eame source que l\u2019action principale\u201d et qui retardait cette action, ou une demande reconventionnelle \u201cr\u00e9sultant d\u2019autres causes\u201d et qui ne pouvait la retarder.\nL\u2019effet de l\u2019arr\u00eat re Lingle v. Knox[8] a \u00e9t\u00e9 que la demande reconventionnelle de Knox Brothers \u201cr\u00e9sultant de la m\u00eame source\u201d et se trouvant au dossier, la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure avait commis une erreur en la traitant purement et simplement comme inexistante. Elle n\u2019en pouvait \u00eatre s\u00e9par\u00e9e et le tribunal devait en disposer en m\u00eame temps que de l\u2019action principale. (Voir notes de M. le Juge Tellier et de M. le Juge Gu\u00e9rin, pp. 328 et 330). Le dossier devait donc \u00eatre retourn\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure pour que l\u2019on y dispose de la. demande reconventionnelle en m\u00eame temps que de l\u2019action principale. Mais cela ne voulait pas dire que cette demande reconventionnelle constituait r\u00e9ellement une contestation qui n\u2019aurait pu \u00eatre faite \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019action originaire en Colombie-Britannique. La Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, \u00e0 qui le dossier fut retourn\u00e9, conservait, suivant nous, le droit de la rejeter de ce chef. C\u2019est bien ce qui est indiqu\u00e9 par ce passage du jugement de notre coll\u00e8gue, Monsieur le Juge Duff, parlant au nom de la cour:\nA question may arise whether the claim under par. 5 of the cross-demand is not one which, in substance (as a claim in respect of diminution in value resulting from breach of the contract of sale), might, on the principle of Mondei v. Steele[9], have been set up, in whole or in part, as a defence to the British Columbia action; see Bow McLachlan & Co. v. The Ship \u201cCamosun\u201d[10]. From this point of view, the relevancy of art. 212 C.P.C., as respects this claim, may have to be considered; but it seems more convenient that any such question should be reserved for the trial.\nDans la cause actuelle, le jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi, pour une cause de droit, dispose de la demande reconventionnelle avant d\u2019adjuger sur l\u2019action principale. Cette m\u00e9thode de proc\u00e9der, loin de lui \u00eatre contraire, est absolument conforme au principe pos\u00e9 re Lingle v. Knox[11].\nIl reste que la Cour du Banc du Roi, pour maintenir l\u2019inscription en droit, ne s\u2019est pas appuy\u00e9e uniquement sur les all\u00e9gations de la d\u00e9claration et de la demande reconventionnelle, mais qu\u2019elle a pris en consid\u00e9ration les pi\u00e8ces produites au soutien de la d\u00e9claration. Elle para\u00eet, en cela, avoir tranch\u00e9 une question de proc\u00e9dure qui \u00e9tait jusqu\u2019ici controvers\u00e9e.\nLa jurisprudence de la Cour Supr\u00eame est d\u2019intervenir dans les\nquestions of practice (only) when they involve substantial rights or the decision appealed from may cause grave injustice.\nF\u00e9vrier v. Tr\u00e9pannier[12]; Lambe v. Armstrong[13]; Eastern Townships Bank v. Swan[14]; Higgins v. Stephens[15]; McKay v.

Il a pr\u00e9tendu qu\u2019en se servant des exhibits pour d\u00e9cider l\u2019inscription en droit la Cour du Banc du Roi s\u2019\u00e9tait appuy\u00e9e sur des documents dont l\u2019authenticit\u00e9 n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie. C\u2019est lui-m\u00eame qui, par sa motion, a demand\u00e9 la production de ces documents avant de produire sa d\u00e9fense et sa demande reconventionnelle. Le jugement qui fut rendu sur cette motion ordonnait qu\u2019on verse au dossier\nthe original or an authentic copy of the record in the said case no.

S\u2019il en contestait l\u2019authenticit\u00e9, l\u2019appelant devait se pourvoir en vertu de l\u2019article 209 du Code de proc\u00e9dure. Il ne l\u2019a pas fait. Au contraire, il a tenu tous ces documents pour exacts, puisqu\u2019il a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que l\u2019ordre de la cour qui avait ordonn\u00e9 la mise au dossier de \u201ccopies authentiques\u201d avait \u00e9t\u00e9 ob\u00e9i et qu\u2019il a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 produire sa d\u00e9fense et sa demande reconventionnelle. Il n\u2019a pas song\u00e9 \u00e0 soulever ce pr\u00e9tendu d\u00e9faut d\u2019authenticit\u00e9 avant d\u2019\u00eatre rendu devant la Cour Supr\u00eame. D\u2019ailleurs, il n\u2019affirme m\u00eame pas que ce d\u00e9faut existe; il se contente de dire que la chose serait possible. Il a eu plus que le temps n\u00e9cessaire pour s\u2019en assurer avant de venir ici et pour adopter les proc\u00e9dures n\u00e9cessaires, s\u2019il y avait lieu, pour faire rejeter ces pi\u00e8ces du dossier.

Is the Combines Investigation Act, R.S.C., 1927, chapter 26, ultra vires the Parliament of Canada, either in whole or in part, and, if so, in what particular or particulars or to what extent?\n2. Is section 498 of the Criminal Code ultra vires the Parliament of Canada, and, if so, in what particular or particulars or to what extent? N. W. Rowell K.C., A. R. McMaster, K.C., and F. P.

Bayly K.C for the Attorney General of Ontario.\nW.F. O\u2019Connor K.C. for Amalgamated Builders Council and Amalgamated Clothing Industries Council.\nOn behalf of the Attorney General of Canada, it was contended that the legislation in question was intra vires, being justifiable as having been enacted in relation to criminal law, the regulation of trade and commerce, patents of invention (as to s. 30 of the Combines Investigation Act), and the peace, order and good government of Canada, under jurisdiction given to the Dominion by s. 91 of the B.N.A. Act.\nOn behalf of the other parties appearing, it was contended that the legislation in question was wholly ultra vires; that the subject matter of the legislation was assigned to the exclusive jurisdiction of the province under heads 13 (property and civil rights in the province), 14 (administration of justice in the province), and 16 (generally all matters of a merely local or private nature in the province) of s. 92 of the B.N.A. Act, and was not assigned to the Parliament of Canada under any of the enumerations in s. 91 of the B.N.A. Act, or under the initial residuary provision of s. 91.\nThe judgment of Duff, Rinfret and Smith JJ. was delivered by\nDuff J.\u2014The scope of the 27th head of section 91 of the British North America Act under these words, \u201cThe Criminal Law, except the constitution of Courts of criminal jurisdiction, but including the procedure in criminal matters,\u201d has been described in sweeping terms by the judgment of the Privy Council in Attorney General for Ontario v. Hamilton Street Railway Co.[1]. The Lord Chancellor (Lord Halsbury), in delivering the judgment there, said: The question turns upon a very simple consideration. The reservation of the criminal law for the Dominion of Canada is given in clear and intelligible words which must be construed according to their natural and ordinary signification. Those words seem to their Lordships to require, and indeed to admit, of no plainer exposition than the language itself affords. Sect. 91, subs. 27, of the British North America Act, 1867, reserves for the exclusive legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada \u201cthe criminal law, except the constitution of Courts of criminal jurisdiction.\u201d It is, therefore, the criminal law in its widest sense that is reserved, and it is impossible, notwithstanding the very protracted argument to which their Lordships have listened, to doubt that an infraction of the Act, which in its original form, without the amendment afterwards introduced, was in operation at the time of confederation, is an offence against the criminal law. The fact that from the criminal law generally there is one exception, namely, \u201cthe constitution of Courts of criminal jurisdiction,\u201d renders it more clear, if anything were necessary to render it more clear, that with that exception (which obviously does not include what has been contended for in this case) the criminal law, in its widest sense, is reserved for the exclusive authority of the Dominion Parliament.\nThe question for consideration in that case was the competency of the Ontario Legislature to pass an enactment respecting the observance of Sunday, and the subject of the paragraph just quoted is the exclusive jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada.\nNevertheless, some limitation upon the general words of s. 91 (27) is necessarily implied by (1) the fact itself that co-ordinate exclusive authority in respect of a variety of subjects is vested in the provincial legislatures, and executive authority of the same order in the provincial governments, and (2) character of the enactments of s. 92. This has been recognized in a series of cases, the Dominion License Acts Reference[2], the Board of Commerce case[3]; Attorney General for Ontario v. Reciptoral Insurers[4]; Attorney General for Canada v. Attorney General for Alberta[5]; Toronto Electric Commissioners v. Snider[6]. The words of head 27 read in their widest sense would enable Parliament to take notice of conduct in any field of human activity, by prohibiting acts of a given description and declaring such acts to be criminal and punishable as such. But it is obvious that the constitutional autonomy of the provinces would disappear, if it were open to the Dominion to employ its powers under head 27 for the purpose of controlling by such means the conduct of persons charged with responsibility for the working of provincial institutions. It is quite clear also that the same result would follow, if it were competent to Parliament, by the use of those powers, to prescribe and indirectly to enforce rules of conduct, to which the provincial legislatures had not given their sanction, in spheres exclusively allotted to provincial control. This has been fully elaborated in the series of cases just mentioned.\nSecond, the language of head 27 must be read in light of head 15 of section 92. Provincial legislative enactments in relation to matters falling within the various heads of s. 92 may, by force of head 15, prescribe sanctions of fine and imprisonment for regulations in respect of such matters; and such regulations may be of such a character that, but for the language of head 27 of s. 91, the offences thus created would be described without hesitation as criminal offences \u2014regulations, for example, for the preservation of public health\/order and decency. Hodge v. The Queen[7]. The exclusive jurisdiction of the Dominion in relation to \u201cCriminal Law\u201d under s. 91 is not incompatible with the possession by the provinces of this jurisdiction; although there is the highest authority for applying to proceedings for enforcing the penal clauses of such enactments the description \u201ccriminal\u201d; and notwithstanding that it appears to have been assumed, in Nadan v. The King[8], that such proceedings come within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament under head 27, s. 91, \u201cprocedure in criminal matters.\u201d\nIt is, of course, essential to the exercise of this jurisdiction by the provinces that the substantive provisions shall, within the sense of s. 92, have \u201crelation to\u201d such \u201clocal\u201d or \u201cprivate\u201d matters, as fall within the scope of the subjects designated by the heads of that section. The existence of this undoubted jurisdiction of the provinces necessarily affects the operation of the powers conferred upon the Dominion under head 27, s. 91. Evidently the Act does not contemplate the use of these powers for the purpose merely of creating sanctions for rules of law in relation to such matters in their provincial aspects. Matters, however, which in one aspect and for one purpose fall within the jurisdiction of a province over the subjects designated by one or more of the heads of s. 92, may in another aspect and for another purpose, be proper subjects of legislation under s. 91, and in particular under head 27.\nThis may be illustrated by reference to the subject matters of s. 92 (13), \u201cProperty and Civil Rights.\u201d You cannot create a new criminal offence without directly affecting civil rights. The characteristic rules of the Criminal Law, rules designed for the protection of the State and its institutions, for the security of property and the person and public order, rules for the suppression of practices which the Criminal Law notices as deserving chastisement by the State, and so on, all are rules restricting the liberty of action of the subjects of the State, and in that sense affecting civil rights; but such acts and neglects are not, as a rule, viewed by the Criminal Law in their juristic aspect, but in their actual effects, physical or moral, as harmful to some interest which it is the duty of the State to protect. They are concerned primarily not with rights, with their creation, the conditions of their exercise, or their extinction; but with some evil or some menace, moral or physical, which the law aims to prevent or suppress through the control of human conduct.\nFraud, for example, may be of such a character as to constitute an actionable wrong or a criminal offence. The law in relation to civil rights, while necessarily concerned with defining the elements of the wrong entailing the civil responsibility of the wrong-doer, is primarily concerned with the victim\u2019s right of reparation, while the Criminal Law deals with the fraud as such, as something deserving of punishment at the hands of the State. So in the case of contracts. An agreement involving bribery of a public official may be a criminal offence because the law marks such acts of corruption as criminal and punishes them. The law in relation to civil rights, the law of contracts, takes note of the elements of the transaction which give it character as bribery, but solely for the purpose of denying to the parties the legal right of enforcing it.\nThese considerations do not provide, of course, any precise formula for discriminating between Criminal Law and legislation in relation to property and civil rights. But the indicia suggested by them would probably be sufficient in most cases for deciding to which of these two categories a given enactment belongs. Indeed, as to the first fourteen heads of s. 92, there would probably be little difficulty in determining whether or not legislation dealing with matters falling in their provincial aspects within the subjects designated by those heads is truly legislation from the provincial point of view, or legislation dealing with such matters in some aspect within the jurisdiction of the Dominion under s. 91, head 27.\nOn the other hand, matters falling within head 16 come under the jurisdiction of a province because they are matters \u201cmerely local\u201d or \u201cmerely private\u201d within the province, in the sense of s. 92. Prohibitions may be enacted under the authority of that head under sanction of fine and imprisonment, with the object of abating or preventing a local evil in the interests of public order or decency, which, as we have seen, may be perfectly valid, and plausible arguments may be adduced in support of the view, that all such enactments are valid, provided they do not trench upon topics already dealt with by the Criminal Law of the Dominion, expressly or tacitly, and do not intervene in subject matters which by their \u201cvery nature belong to the domain of criminal jurisprudence.\u201d The exclusive jurisdiction of the Dominion in relation to Criminal Law is not, as I have said, incompatible with the creation by provincial enactment of offences which it has been held properly fall within the description \u201ccriminal.\u201d But if such matters present aspects which are appropriate subjects for criminal legislation, it does not follow that they may not be the subject of valid legislation under the powers conferred by s. 91 (27).\nThe matter of section 498 is not property and civil rights. It strikes at agreements, no doubt, but not at those agreements as juridical acts, as having effects in point of law, in creating rights between the parties. The legislation aims at suppressing certain practices calculated, in the view of Parliament, to limit competition and produce the evil of high prices. Agreements of defined classes are dealt with from that point of view and from that point of view only. Nor can the matter of s. 498 be described as matter \u201cmerely local or private\u201d within the several provinces. The combinations struck at, rarely, in their origin or in their operation, take account of provincial boundaries. There is in this respect little, if any, resemblance between s. 498 and the enactments which were the subjects of decision in the Dominion Liquor License Acts Reference[9], in the Board of Commerce case[10], or in Snider\u2019s case[11]. In the enactments in debate in those cases, the penal provisions were merely incidental. There was an attempt, in each case, in the substantive provisions of the impeached enactment, to regulate matters which were unquestionably \u201cmerely local\u201d or \u201cmerely private\u201d in each of the provinces in a manner which could, it was held, not be justified, as an exercise of the powers conferred by the residuary clause or the second head of s. 91.\nIt was argued that the Dominion\u2019s jurisdiction only enables Parliament to legislate in relation to offences which were criminal offences at the time of confederation, or to offences which in \u201ctheir very nature\u201d belong to the domain \u201cof the Criminal Law.\u201d It is difficult to understand upon what justification the Dominion Parliament can be denied the power under s. 91 to declare any act to be a crime which, in its opinion, is such a violation of generally accepted standards of conduct as to deserve chastisement as a crime. The views of the community as to what deserves punishment change from generation to generation. Practices calculated to imperil health and safety, or to prejudice the moral standards of the community may become, in the course of a few years, so widely prevalent as to create a general demand for the abatement and prevention of them by State action in the sphere of the Criminal Law. Other acts, once within the scope of the Criminal Law, may, in the course of time, come to be regarded as outside the proper domain of State interference. It is difficult to understand on what principle the court is to review the decisions of Parliament in seeking to adapt the Criminal Law to successive phases of public opinion in such matters. I am assuming, of course, that Parliament in such decisions is not attempting to deal with matters committed to the provinces in their provincial aspects. Moreover, practices tending to limit competition, to foster monopolies in the popular sense, to enhance prices (the practices of forestalling, regrating and engrossing), were for centuries treated as crimes and were regarded by the law as crimes mala in se; the matter of section 498 is a kindred topic.\nI do not intend, by what I have said, to imply that Dominion legislation on the subject of the criminal law is necessarily ultra vires because it deals with a matter which is local in one or more of the provinces.\nAs to the Combines Investigation Act, that is an Act which, as its name imports, provides for the investigation of matters touching the existence of a combine or the pending formation of a combine; and further provides that where, as the result of investigation, it appears that such a combine exists, the Governor in Council may, in appropriate cases, cause the reduction or abolition of any customs duty imposed on any article affected by it; and where it appears that there has been abuse of his privileges by the holder of any patent under the Patent Act, in the manner set out by the Act, the Minister of Justice may exhibit an information in the Exchequer Court of Canada praying the revocation of the patent, and authority is given to the court to give judgment accordingly. The Act also provides that anybody knowingly assisting in the formation of a combine shall be guilty of an indictable offence, and punishable on conviction at the instance of the Solicitor-General of Canada or an Attorney General of the province. Throughout the Act the word \u201ccombines\u201d denotes:\ncombines which have operated or are likely to operate to the detriment or against the interest of the public, whether consumers, producers or others, and which\n(a) are mergers, trusts or monopolies, so called; or\n(b) result from the purchase, lease, or other acquisition by any person of any control over or interest in the whole or part of the business of any other person; or\n(c) result from any actual or tacit contract, agreement, arrangement, or combination which has or is designed to have the effect of\n(i) limiting facilities for transporting, producing, manufacturing, supplying, storing or dealing, or (ii) preventing, limiting or lessening manufacture or production, or\n(iii) fixing a common price or a resale price, or a common rental, or a common cost of storage or transportation, or\n(iv) enhancing the price, rental or cost of article, rental, storage or transportation, or\n(v) preventing or lessening competition in, or substantially controlling witihin any particular area or district or generally, production, manufacture, purchase, barter, sale, storage, transportation, insurance or supply, or\n(vi) otherwise restraining or injuring trade or commerce.\nThat part of the Act which makes it a criminal offence to assist in the formation of a combine, has in principle been already discussed.\nAs to the other provisions, they may be looked upon from two points of view. First, one may consider them from the point of view of the responsibility imposed upon Parliament in respect of trade and commerce, especially the responsibility in relation to trade with foreign countries and customs and excise duties. It is hardly necessary to observe that trade combinations and their effect upon competition and the results of competition have a special importance and significance in view of the settled policy of this country in the matter of protective duties. To the general belief that such duties, when imposed upon the scale on which they are maintained in this country, tend in their effects to facilitate the operation of plans for reducing competition and maintaining prices, it may be surmised that legislation such as s. 498 in the Criminal Code and the Statute we are now considering, are very largely due. It appears to me that legislative authority over trade and commerce with foreign countries, and particularly over such aspects of those subjects as are related to the economic conditions and tendencies arising from the law in force on those subjects, must embrace the authority to legislate for such investigations as those authorized by this Act. It is quite true, combinations in relation to transport and to insurance would not appear, ex facie, to be directly connected with the imposition of customs duties. But the Dominion has a special jurisdiction in relation to insurance, jurisdiction touching, that is to say, the rights of foreign countries and foreigners generally to engage in the business of insurance in Canada; and considering that the design of the reigning trade policy is to encourage domestic trade, and that its effectiveness for that end may depend upon the character of the facilities for, and the rates of, domestic transport, the authority to conduct such investigations ought, in a fair view of the matter, to enable Parliament to include the subject of transport within the scope of them.\nThe other point of view is that of the responsibility of the Dominion with regard to the Criminal Law. The authority in relation to the Criminal Law and Criminal Procedure given by s. 91 (27) would appear to confer upon the Dominion, not as an incidental power merely, but as an essential part of it, the power to provide for investigation into crime, actual and potential.\nAn attempt was made on the argument to bring this statute under the decision of the Privy Council in relation to the Combines and Fair Prices Act[12]. There is no doubt that parts of the present statute are taken from the earlier Act, but the provisions of the earlier Act which gave character to that Act have disappeared.\nThe former statute in its substantive enactments on the subject of combines conferred upon the Board of Commerce, a Board created by Dominion legislation, composed of persons named by the Dominion Government, the authority and the duty to inquire into the existence of combines and plans for the formation of combines, and to suppress, by order of the Board, the combines themselves, and practices associated with combines, in so far as the Board might think it right and in the public interest to do so. The present Act gives no such power of regulation.\nBoth questions should be answered in the negative.\nThe judgment of Mignault, Newcombe and Lamont JJ. was delivered by\nNewcombe J.\u2014Two questions have been propounded by the Governor General in Council for hearing and consideration under the usual practice. They are:\u2014\n\u201c1. Is the Combines Investigation Act, R.S.C. 1927, Chapter 26, ultra vires the Parliament of Canada, either in whole or in part, and, if so, in what particular or particulars, or to what extent? \u201c2. Is Section 498 of the Criminal Code ultra vires the Parliament of Canada, and, if so, in what particular or particulars, or to what extent?\u201d\nCounsel were heard on behalf of the Attorney General of Canada and also for several of the provinces, and counsel were also heard on behalf of the Amalgamated Builders\u2019 Council and Amalgamated Clothing Industries\u2019 Council, and for the Proprietary Articles Trade Association; these bodies having been authorized by the Court to be heard as classes of persons interested within the meaning of subs. 4 of s. 55 of the Supreme Court Act.\nI would answer both these questions in the negative, because I am satisfied that the legislation strictly appertains to powers which the Parliament of Canada has, by s. 91 of the British North America Act, 1867,\n* * * to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada, in relation to all matters not coming within the classes of subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the Legislatures of the Provinces; and for greater certainty, but not so as to restrict the generality of the foregoing terms of this section, it is hereby declared that (notwithstanding anything in this Act) the exclusive Legislative Authority of the Parliament of Canada extends to all matters coming within the classes of subjects next hereinafter enumerated; that is to say,\u2014\n* * * * *\n2. The Regulation of Trade and Commerce.\n* ** * *\n27. The Criminal Law, except the Constitution of Courts of Criminal Jurisdiction, but including the Procedure in Criminal Matters.\n* * * * *\nAnd any matter coming within any of the classes of subjects enumerated in this section shall not be deemed to come within the class of matters of a local or private nature comprised in the enumeration of the classes of subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the Legislatures of the Provinces.\nIn the consideration of these provisions it may be useful here to mention the provincial enumerations upon which the advocates of affirmative answers rely. They are to be found in s. 92, by which it is enacted that\nIn each Province the Legislature may exclusively make laws in relation to matters coming within the classes of subjects next hereinafter enumerated; that is to say,\u2014\n* * * * *\n13. Property and Civil Rights in the Province.\n14. The Administration of Justice in the Province, including the Constitution, Maintenance and Organization of Provincial Courts, both of Civil and of Criminal Jurisdiction, and including Procedure in Civil Matters in those Courts. 15. The Imposition of Punishment by Fine, Penalty, or Imprisonment for enforcing any Law of the Province made in relation to any matter coming within any of the classes of subjects enumerated in this section.\n16. Generally all matters of a merely local or private nature in the Province.\nIt is not, in my opinion, open to question that the powers of Parliament with relation to the criminal law extend, not only to common law and statutory offences, as derived from the Laws of England, or locally enacted, under the constitution of the various provinces and territories of the Dominion, and existing therein at the time of the Union or admission of these provinces or territories into the Union, but comprehend also the power to create new statutory offences. It is, I think, certain that there is legislative authority in the Dominion, when the need arises, to declare criminal, and to prescribe the punishments for, acts or omissions which were lawful and innocent by the common law or by Imperial legislation which, subject to the provisions of the Colonial Laws Validity Act, 28-29 Vic, c. 63, is continued in force by s. 129 of the British North America Act, 1867, in the four original provinces, or as extended and applied to the provinces and territories subsequently admitted; and this conclusion must follow from the interpretation enunciated by their Lordships of the Judicial Committee in the case of Attorney-General for Ontario v. Hamilton Street Railway Co.[13], where it was held that the Ontario Act to Prevent the Profanation of the Lord\u2019s Day, R.S.O., 1897, c. 246, was, as a whole, ultra vires of the provincial legislature. That case was heard by a very powerful court, which included the Lord Chancellor (Halsbury), Lord Macnaghten, Lord Shand, Lord Davey, Lord Robertson and Lord Lind-ley. The Lord Chancellor, in pronouncing the judgment, expressed himself as follows:\u2014\nThe question turns upon a very simple consideration. The reservation of the criminal law for the Dominion of Canada is given in clear and intelligible words which must be construed according to their natural and ordinary signification. Those words seem to their Lordships to require, and indeed to admit, of no plainer exposition than the language itself affords. Sect. 91, subs. 27, of the British North America Act, 1867, reserves for the exclusive legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada \u201cthe criminal law, except the constitution of Courts of criminal jurisdiction.\u201d It is, therefore, the criminal law in its widest sense that is reserved, and it is impossible, notwithstanding the very protracted argument to which their Lordships have listened, to doubt that an infraction of the Act, which in its original form, without the amendment afterwards introduced, was in operation at the time of confederation, is an offence against the criminal law. The fact that from the criminal law generally there is one exception, namely, \u201cthe constitution of Courts of criminal jurisdiction,\u201d renders it more clear, if anything were necessary to render it more clear, that with that exception (which obviously does not include what has been contended for in this case) the criminal law, in its widest sense, is reserved for the exclusive authority of the Dominion Parliament.\nThe extent of the Dominion power is thus so clearly and unmistakably stated that one seeks for a reason for the submission of the questions in hand, and it appears to have arisen out of some of the observations of their Lordships of the Judicial Committee in more recent decisions; but, in my view, the doubt so suggested vanishes when these decisions are properly understood.\nThe Dominion Insurance Act of 1910, which was considered in Attorney General of Canada v. Attorney General of Alberta[14], embodied a very elaborate set of provisions of considerable variety, designed to regulate the business or trade of insurance, based upon a legislative prohibition, which is to be found in s. 4, the leading section, of that Act, against the acceptance of any insurance risk or policy without a general license from the Minister who was charged with the administration of the Act. The principal question was as to whether s. 4 was ultra vires of the Parliament, and it was held in the affirmative, upon the ground that the subject matter was within exclusive provincial powers. Section 70 was an ancillary provision, imposing penalties for contravention of the Act, and, of course, it fell with the principal enactment, which it was designed to enforce. It was not, indeed, attempted to uphold this latter provision as an independent exercise of the Dominion power with relation to criminal law. This decision led to some amendments of the Dominion Insurance Act involving modifications of the former provisions.\nSubsequently, in 1921, a question arose as to the validity of the Board of Commerce Act, 1919, and the Combines and Fair Prices Act, 1919, whereby, as narrated in the head-note[15], the Parliament of Canada had purported to prohibit the formation and operation of such trade combinations for production and distribution in the provinces as the Board of Commerce might consider to be detrimental to the public interest. It was, moreover, provided that the Board might restrict the accumulation of food, clothing and fuel beyond the amount reasonably required, in the case of a private person, for his household, and, in the case of a trader, for his business, and require the surplus to be offered for sale at fair prices; and that the Board could attach criminal consequences for breaches of the Act. The case is reported in [1922] 1 A.C., 191. It was argued that the legislation could be sustained, among other grounds, as criminal law, but it was held otherwise. Their Lordships referred to the Insurance Case of 1916[16] as an illustration of the impotency of the Dominion power for the regulation of trade and commerce, taken by itself, to authorize interference with particular trades in which Canadians would, apart from any right of interference otherwise conferred, be free to engage in the provinces. The result was said to be the outcome of a series of well-known decisions of earlier dates. Then follow these observations:\u2014\nFor analogous reasons the words of head 27 of s. 91 do not assist the argument for the Dominion. It is one thing to construe the words \u201cthe criminal law, except the constitution of courts of criminal jurisdiction, but including the procedure in criminal matters,\u201d as enabling the Dominion Parliament to exercise exclusive legislative power where the subject matter is one which by its very nature belongs to the domain of criminal jurisprudence. A general law, to take an example, making incest a crime, belongs to this class. It is quite another thing, first to attempt to interfere with a class of subject committed exclusively to the Provincial Legislature, and then to justify this (by enacting ancillary provisions, designated as new phases of Dominion criminal law which require a title to so interfere as basis of their application.\nOne must, of course, endeavour to extract the meaning of this paragraph, and perhaps some confusion is apt to be caused by the antithesis, and the illustration chosen for the explanation of the first limb, but I am persuaded that there can be no intention here to restrict the legislative power of Parliament in the creation of offences under s. 91 (27) so as to exclude an act or omission which is not malum in se. The occasion did not call for that, and the passage should be read secundum subjectam, materiam. It is not necessarily inconsistent, and I do not think it was meant to be incompatible, with the notion, that one must have regard to the subject matter, the aspect, the purpose and intention, instead of the form of the legislation, in ascertaining whether, in producing, the enactment, Parliament was engaged in the exercise of its exclusive and comprehensive powers with respect to the criminal law, or was attempting, in excess of its authority, under colour of the criminal law, to entrench upon property and civil rights, or private and local matters, in the provinces; and when, in the case of the Combines and Fair Prices Act, 1919, as in the case of the Insurance Act, 1910, their Lordships found that Parliament was really occupied in a project of regulating property and civil rights, and outside of its constitutional sphere, there was no footing upon which the exercise of Dominion powers, with relation to the criminal law, could effectively be introduced\u2014no valid enactment to which criminal sanction could be applied. The principle is illustrated by a remark of Lord Dunedin in Grand Trunk Railway Company of Canada v. Attorney General of Canada[17], which may be applied mutatis mutandis; his Lordship said:\nAccordingly, the true question in the present case does not seem to turn upon the question whether this law deals with a civil right\u2014which may be conceded\u2014but whether this law is truly ancillary to railway legislation.\nIn the Insurance case[18], Lord Haldane had already recognized the principle as well established, but none the less to be applied only with great caution,\nthat subjects which in one aspect and for one purpose fall within the jurisdiction of the provincial legislatures may in another aspect and for another purpose fall within Dominion legislative jurisdiction.\nAnd I am convinced that he never intended to suggest that Parliament might not competently find a public wrong lurking or tolerated under the head of civil rights in a province which it is necessary or expedient, according to its will and discretion, or, using Sir Matthew Hale\u2019s expression, \u201cby the prudence of law-givers,\u201d to suppress, in the exercise of its authority over the criminal law.\nThen came the Reciprocal Insurers\u2019 case[19], which contributes a very instructive addition to the interpretation of the British North America Acts. This case suggests no limitation of the legislative authority of the Dominion with regard to the criminal law, although it recognizes that a Dominion enactment, which, in language and form, and a sociis; is criminal, may, having regard to its history, real subject matter, true aspect and purpose, by which it must also be judged, be found, in reality, intended to regulate property and civil rights in a province, or matters of a merely local or private nature, such as have been committed to the exclusive authority of the provinces, and so not to fall within the Dominion enumeration; and it is especially made clear that the quality of such an enactment is not concluded by its introduction into the Criminal Code. This decision, in its application to the present question, affirms, with respect to the Dominion insurance legislation of 1917, what was decided in the year immediately preceding, namely, that a provision like s. 70 of the Act of 1910, and which differed from it in no material respect as to the essential purpose which it was intended to serve, remained ancillary and inoperative, notwithstanding the alterations of form to which it had been subjected and its incorporation as an independent section in the Criminal Code; and Mr. Justice Duff, who pronounced the judgment of the Board, having reviewed the preceding decisions, observed, at page 337, that:\nIt has been formally laid down in judgments of this Board, that in such an inquiry the Courts must ascertain the \u201ctrue nature and character\u201d of the enactment: Citizens\u2019 Insurance Co. v. Parsons[20]; its \u201cpith and substance\u201d: Union Colliery Co. v. Bryden[21]; and it is the result of this investigation, not the form alone, which the statute may have assumed under the hand of the draughtsman, that will determine within which of the categories of subject matters mentioned in ss. 91 and 92 the legislation falls; and for this purpose the legislation must be \u201cscrutinized in its entirety\u201d: Great West Saddlery Co. v. The King[22]. Of course, where there is an absolute jurisdiction vested in a Legislature, the laws promulgated by it must take effect according to the proper construction of the language in which they are expressed. But where the law-making authority is of a limited or qualified character, obviously it may be necessary to examine with some strictness the substance of the legislation for the purpose of determining what it is that the Legislature is really doing.\nAnd further, at page 342:\nIn accordance with the principle inherent in these decisions their Lordships think it is no longer open to dispute that the Parliament of Canada cannot, by purporting to create penal sanctions under s. 91, head 27, appropriate to itself exclusively a field of jurisdiction in which, apart from such a procedure, it could exert no legal authority, and that if, when examined as a whole, legislation in form criminal is found, in aspects and for purposes exclusively within the provincial sphere, to deal with matters committed to the Provinces, it cannot be upheld as valid. His Lordship thought it proper to add, however, that what had been said\ndoes not involve any denial of the authority of the Dominion Parliament to create offences merely because the legislation deals with matters which, in another aspect, may fall under one or more of the subdivisions of the jurisdiction entrusted to the Provinces.\nA case involving the like consideration was Toronto Electric Commissioners v. Snider[23], where the question arose as to the authority of the Dominion to enact the Industrial Disputes Investigation Act, 1907, which provided, in effect, speaking by the head-note, that upon disputes occurring between employers and employees in any of a large number of important industries in Canada, the Dominion Minister for Labour might appoint a Board of Investigation and Conciliation to make investigations, with power to summon witnesses and inspect documents and premises, and, if no settlement could be brought about, to recommend fair terms; and, pending the reference, a lockout or strike was prohibited, subject to penalties. It was held that this legislation conflicted with provincial powers as to property and civil rights in the provinces or other enumerations of s. 92; and Lord Haldane, who pronounced the judgment, referred to the judgment in the Reciprocal Insurers\u2019 case[24], as summing up the effect of the series of previous decisions relating to the point; and he reiterated the antithetical passage quoted above. His Lordship was of the opinion that, on authority as well as on principle, the Board was precluded from accepting the Act as justified in the exercise of Dominion power under s. 91 with relation to criminal law. He reviewed the provision of the Act in question, and concluded with the following important observations:\nIt is obvious that these provisions dealt with civil rights, and it was not within the power of the Dominion Parliament to make this otherwise by imposing merely ancillary penalties. The penalties for breach of the restrictions did not render the statute the less an interference with civil rights in its pith and substance. The Act is not one which aims at making striking generally a new crime.\nIt would seem manifestly to be implied from the last sentence, that different considerations would have presented themselves if the real purpose of the statute had been found to be the construction of a new offence. It must not be overlooked that, by the 15th enumeration of s. 92, there is included among the classes of subjects as to which the provincial legislatures may exclusively make laws:\u2014\nThe imposition of punishment by fine, penalty, or imprisonment for enforcing any law of the province made in relation to any matter coming within any of the classes of subjects enumerated in this section.\nAnd local enactments, deriving their force from the exercise of the powers conferred by this enumeration, have been described as provincial criminal law. In Russell v. The Queen[25], Sir Montague Smith, delivering the judgment, referred to an argument submitted by Mr. Benjamin, that, if the Act related to Oriminal law, it was provincial criminal law under the 15th enumeration of s. 92; and his Lordship said that no doubt\nthis argument would be well founded if the principal matter of the Act could be brought within any of these classes of subjects.\nMore recently, in the oase of Rex v. Nat Bell Liquors Limited[26], their Lordships had to consider the effect of a conviction under a local liquor Act of Alberta. By s. 36 of the Supreme Court Act, as enacted by c. 32 of 1920, the appellate jurisdiction of the Court had been limited by an exception excluding\ncriminal causes and in proceedings for or upon a writ of habeas corpus, certiorari or prohibition arising out of a criminal charge,\nand the question was considered as to whether a prosecution under a typical temperance Act was or was not a criminal charge. Lord Sumner, who delivered the judgment, at pages 167 and 168, disposed of this issue as follows:\u2014\nThe issue is really this. Ought the word \u201ccriminal\u201d in the section in question to be limited to the sense in which \u201ccriminal\u201d legislation is exclusively reserved to the Dominion Legislature by the British North America Act, s. 91, or does it include that power of enforcing other legislation by the imposition of penalties, including imprisonment, which it has been held that s. 92 authorizes Provincial Legislatures to exercise? It may also be asked (though this question is not precisely identical) under which category does this conviction fall of the two referred to by Bowen L.J., in Osborne v. Milman[27], when he contrasts the cases \u201cwhere an act is prohibited, in the sense that it is rendered criminal,\u201d and \u201cwhere the statute merely affixes certain consequences, more or less unpleasant, to the doing of the act.\u201d\nTheir Lordships are of opinion that the word \u201ccriminal\u201d in the section and in the context in question is used in contradistinction to \u201ccivil,\u201d and \u201cconnotes a proceeding which is not civil in its character.\u201d Certiorari and prohibition are matters of procedure, and all the procedural incidents of this charge are the same whether or not it was one falling exclusively within the legislative competence of the Dominion Legislature, under s. 91, head 27.\nIt is not, for present purposes, necessary to ascertain precisely what is meant by the concluding sentence, but it may be observed that the criminal law, under s. 91 (27), includes expressly \u201cthe procedure in criminal matters,\u201d and that, viewing s. 92 (15) as authorizing the constitution of crimes by the provincial legislatures, there is no express provision empowering those legislatures to enact procedure for the enforcement of the punishments so imposed.\nLater, in Nadan v. The King[28], the Board had to consider the effect of s. 1025 (now s. 1024 (4)) of the Criminal Code, by which it was provided that:\nNotwithstanding any royal prerogative, or anything contained in the Interpretation Act or in the Supreme Court Act, no appeal shall be brought in any criminal case from any judgment or order of any court in Canada to any court of appeal or authority by which in the United Kingdom appeals or petitions to His Majesty in Council may be heard.\nThere was a conviction in question for an offence against the provincial Government Liquor Control Act of Alberta, and it was argued that the foregoing section did not apply to a penalty imposed by a provincial statute in which it was not incorporated. Their Lordships were of the view, however, that this contention was negatived in principle by the judgment of the Board in Rex v. Nat Bell Liquors Ltd.[29]. They held that:\nSect. 1025 is expressed to apply to an appeal in a criminal case from \u201cany judgment or order of any Court in Canada,\u201d and this expression is wide enough to cover a conviction in any Canadian Court for breach of a statute, whether passed by the Legislature of the Dominion or by the Legislature of the Province.\nIt must therefore, of course, if I realize the effect of these decisions, be considered that provincial enactments, falling within the 15th enumeration of s. 92, belong to that branch of the law which is criminal. But this does not necessarily diminish or affect the amplitude of Dominion powers under s. 91 (27). What the provinces may do under the authority of s. 92 (15) is to impose punishment, by fine, penalty or imprisonment, for enforcing any law of the province made in relation to a matter coming within any of the provincial enumerations, and is therefore confined to matters described generally as of a merely local or private nature in the province. But the concluding paragraph of s. 91 must be considered, and it was thus explained by Lord Watson, in the Liquor Prohibition case[30]:\nIt was apparently contemplated by the framers of the Imperial Act of 1867 that the due exercise of the enumerated powers conferred upon the Parliament of Canada by s. 91 might, occasionally and incidentally, involve legislation upon matters which are prima facie committed exclusively to the provincial legislatures by s. 92. In order to provide against that contingency, the concluding part of s. 91 enacts that \u201cany matter coming within any of the classes of subjects enumerated in this section shall not be deemed to come within the class of matters of a local or private nature comprised in the enumeration of the classes of subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces.\u201d It was observed by this Board in Citizens\u2019 Insurance Co. of Canada v. Parsons[31], that the paragraph just quoted \u201capplies in its grammatical construction; only to No. 16 of s. 92.\u201d The observation was not material to the question arising in that case, and it does not appear to their Lordships to be strictly accurate. It appears to them that the language of the exception in s. 91 was meant to include and correctly describes all the matters enumerated in the sixteen heads of s. 92, as being, from a provincial point of view, of a local or private nature. It also appears to their Lordships that the exception was not meant to derogate from the legislative authority given to provincial legislatures by these sixteen subsections, save to the extent of enabling the Parliament of Canada to deal with matters local or private in those cases where such legislation is necessarily incidental to the exercise of the powers conferred upon it by the enumerative heads of clause 91. That view was stated and illustrated by Sir Montague Smith in Citizens\u2019 Insurance Co. of Canada v. Parsons[32] and in Cushing v. Dupuy[33]; and it has been recognized by this Board in Tennant v. Union Bank of Canada[34], and in Attorney General of Ontario v. Attorney General for the Dominion[35].\nConsequently, if it be, as I apprehend, that the criminal law, in its widest sense, is reserved for the Parliament of Canada, a branch of that criminal law cannot well be exclusively within the authority of a province, and, while the provinces may undoubtedly, within their local and private range of legislative power, and in that aspect, impose punishments for enforcing their local laws which are in other respects intra vires\u2014punishments that are, in the sense of the decisions, laws of a criminal nature\u2014they can- not thereby occupy, so as to obstruct, a field of legislation, like that of the criminal law, which has been committed exclusively to the Dominion.\nEach question answered in the negative.\nSolicitor for the Attorney-General of Canada: W.

The originality required involves the exercise of intellectual activity so as to suggest for the first time the application of a particular pattern, shape or ornament to some special subject matter to which it had not been applied before. (Dover, Ltd. v. N\u00fcrnberger Celluloidwaren Fabrik Gebr\u00fcder Wolff [1919] 2 Ch., 25, at p. 29). To constitute an original design there must be some substantial difference between it and what had theretofore existed as applied to articles of an analogous character.\nAppellant\u2019s registered design, which related to a rack for display of garments in a retail store, held not to have fulfilled above requirements (and therefore not to have been proper subject matter for registration) but to have (been anticipated in a previous design for a bedside table, whose function was held analogious to that of a garment rack. (In re Clarke\u2019s Design, [1896] 2 Oh., 38, at p. 44; In re Read & Gres-well\u2019s Design, 42 Oh. D., 200, at p. 262, referred to-. Walker, Hunter & Co. v. Falkirk Iron Co., 4 R.P.C., 390, distinguished on the facts.)\nAn attack on the validity of registration of a design is not limited to\nproceedings under s. 42 of said Act (R.S.C. 1906, c. 71), but may be made by an alleged infringer when sued by the registered owner. (In re Clarke\u2019s Design, supra, at p. 42).\nJudgment of Maclean J., [1928] Ex. C.R. 159, affirmed in the result.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada (1), dismissing its action for relief for alleged infringement by defendant of plaintiff\u2019s registered design of a display stand. Maclean J. held that there was no novelty or subject matter in the plaintiff\u2019s registered design, and that the same was invalid.\nThe material facts of the oase are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was dismissed with costs.\nR. S. Smart K.C. for the appellant.\nH. G. Fox and B. McPherson for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nLamont J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the President of the Exchequer Court[1] in favour of the defendant in an action for damages for the infringement of an Industrial Design which the plaintiff had, on November 26, 1926, registered under the provisions of the TradeMark and Design Act (R.S.C. 1906, c. 71). The ground upon which the learned President, based his judgment was that the plaintiff\u2019s design was not novel and was not proper subject-matter for registration.\nThe design in question relates to a rack or stand for the display of garments in a retail store. In its structure this rack is extremely simple. It consists of a straight horizontal bar so supported at its extremities that garments can be hung on it on ordinary coat or garment hangers. Each of the side supports consists of a vertical bar the lower end of which is fitted into a base or footing which rests upon the floor, and these footings are connected by another horizontal bar which holds the rack firm. The footing at each side where it connects with the bar is ornamented so, that, in conjunction with an ornamented boss which encircles the upright at the lower end and reste on the footing, the effect produced is pleasing to the eye. The junction of each upright with the top horizontal bar is also ornamented. It is upon the shape of the base or footing and the character of the ornamentation that the appellant relies to justify the conclusion that the combination is artistic, new and original.\nNo definition of a \u201cdesign\u201d is given in the Act. The word must, therefore, be taken in its ordinary signification which Lindley, L.J., in In re Clarke\u2019s Design[2], stated means: \u201cSomething marked out\u2014a plan or representation of something.\u201d A \u201cdesign\u201d is, therefore, a pattern or representation which the eye can see and which can be applied to a manufactured article. To be entitled to registration the \u201cdesign\u201d must be original. The Act does not expressly call for novelty, but s. 27 (3) provides that the Minister\u2019s certificate of registration shall, in the absence of proof to the contrary, be sufficient evidence of the originality of the design. Just what is contemplated by \u201coriginality\u201d the Act does not make clear. Under the English Act a design, to be registrable, must be \u201cnew or original.\u201d As that Act uses both words it has, in a number of cases, been sought to draw a distinction in meaning between them, and it has been held that \u201cevery design which is original is new, but every design which is new is not necessarily original.\u201d In re Rollason\u2019s Design[3].\nIn Dover, Limited v. N\u00fcrnberger Celluloidwaren Fabrik Gebr\u00fcder Wolff[4], Buckley, L.J., defines \u201coriginal\u201d as applied to designs, as follows:\u2014\nThe word \u201coriginal\u201d contemplates that the person has originated something, that by the exercise of intellectual activity he has started an idea which had not occurred to any one before, that a particular pattern or shape or ornament may foe rendered applicable to the particular article to which he suggests that it shall be applied. If that state of things foe satisfied, then the design will foe original although the actual picture or shape or whatever it is which is being considered is old in the sense that it has existed with reference to another article before. And further on he says:\u2014\nThere must be the exercise of intellectual activity so as to originate, that is to say suggest for the first time, something which had not occurred to any one before as to applying by some manual, mechanical, or chemical means some pattern, shape, or ornament to some special subject-matter to which it had not been applied before.\nThe above quotations, in my opinion, set out what is called for by our Act. Does the appellant\u2019s design comply therewith?\nIn so far as the rack feature of the appellant\u2019s design is concerned (that is the horizontal bar upon which the garments are to be hung supported by upright side bars and connected at the bottom by another bar) the appellant admits that, before his registration, it was well known in the art, and no claim is made in respect thereof. The base or footing upon which stress is laid is briefly described as being composed of oppositely-disposed curved arms of which the outer ends and the upper side of the inner ends terminate in a spiral scroll. This configuration is commonly known as the double ogee curve. The top of the base between the scrolls is flat and supports the upright which at the bottom is, as I have already pointed out, encircled by an ornamented boss. On the outer side of the base there is a heart-shaped panel carrying ornamentation. Each upright is crowned with a fluted, conical-shaped cap, while on its outer side, opposite to the point where it forms a junction with the top horizontal bar, there is an ornamented panel. Such being the appellant\u2019s design, we have to determine if it could properly be said to possess, originality. The registration thereof was for the rack as a whole and not simply for its configuration and ornamentation.\nIn the judgment appealed from, the learned President held that it had been anticipated by a rack (Exhibit B) which the respondent, in the latter part of 1925 or the earlier part of 1926, had obtained in the United States-where it was manufactured. This rack had the same general characteristics as the one for which the appellant; obtained registration. It had the same general outline, and the same underslung feature of the base. It had\u2019 oppositely-disposed curved arms which, it was argued, constituted the double ogee curve. This rack the learned: President held to be essentially the same as the appellant\u2019s registered design. It was, however, without ornamentation. To my eye there is a difference between the ogee curve of the arms of the appellant\u2019s base and the arms of the base of the rack obtained in the United States by the respondent. In the latter, instead of having the curve commencing at the inner end of the arm and ending at the extreme outer end, I find the arm extending half its length at the inner end in a perfectly straight line, then making an abrupt curve and ending in a flat knob which does not have the same artistic appearance as the double ogee curve. It must be remembered, however, that to constitute an original design there must be some substantial difference between the new design and what had theretofore existed. A slight change of outline or configuration, or an unsubstantial variation is not sufficient to enable the author to obtain registration. If it were, the benefits which the Act was intended to secure would be to a great extent lost and industry would be hampered, if not indeed paralyzed. Whether these differences between Exhibit B and the appellant\u2019s registered design are so unsubstantial as to prevent the appellant\u2019s design being proper subject-matter for registration I find it unnecessary to determine, for even if we were to hold that the appellant\u2019s registered design was not anticipated by Exhibit B, it was, in my opinion, anticipated by Exhibit F, which shews a cut of a bedside table which had been on the market for years prior to the appellant\u2019s registration, and which was composed of two underslung base footings the arms of which presented the same double ogee curve as the appellant\u2019s design. These footings were joined together by a bar and from the centre of one of them there extended a vertical upright bar which supported a horizontal bar to the upper side of which was fastened a small table. If anyone had taken the uprights joined together by the top horizontal bar of Exhibit B and had set them in the base footings of Exhibit F, he would have had precisely the design registered by appellant, less the ornamentation. The question then is: Could the appellant company take the framework of Exhibit B and set it on the base footings of Exhibit F, place ornamentation thereon, and properly call it an original design? In my opinion it could not. What is there original about it? Not the underslung base; not the configuration of the ogee curves; not the outline of the rack itself; nothing but the ornamentation, and the ornamentation is not what was registered. For the appellant it was contended that it was quite open to it to take old designs and combine them into a new form and obtain registration thereof as a new design. I agree, provided that from the combination there is produced an original design which is substantially different from any of the old designs, or any known combination thereof.\nIt was further contended that, even if the arms of the footings in Exhibit F possessed the same double ogee curve as the appellant\u2019s rack, it had been applied only to bedside tables and not to garment racks, and that, even if it had been registered for bedside tables, the appellant was entitled to have it registered for a different class of article, and, as authority therefor, the case of Walker, Hunter & Co. v. Falkirk Iron Co.[5], was cited. In that case it was held that a design for a kitchen range fire door with moulding on the top which, by being attached to the door, shut out all cold air and assisted the draft, and fulfilled a function in no way analogous to anything found in its former use, was a properly registered design, although similar mouldings had been used on sideboards. Whether or not a design is original is a question of fact and, unless the matter dealt with in one case is identical with that dealt with in another, a decision on the facts in the one case is of little assistance in the other. In In re Clarke\u2019s Design[6], Lindley, L.J., said:\u2014\nBut it has been decided! that if a design is really old in its application to some manufactured article its application to a new substance will not necessarily entitle it to protection, although such substance may not fall within the class (to which the first article belongs.\nand in In re Read & Greswell\u2019s Design[7], Chitty J. said:\u2014\nTo be capable of being registered a design must be \u201cnew or original\u201d in fact, and not, as is suggested, \u201cnew or original\u201d as to some particular class of goods. It cannot be said to be new and original if it is already being applied to articles of an analogous character.\nIn my opinion, the function of a bedside table is analogous to that of a garment rack. The purpose of each is to have the top bar support a weight. Whether that weight is placed directly upon the upper side of the bar by the weight itself or is placed there by means of a hook to which the weight is attached cannot, in my opinion, be material. Apart, therefore, from the ornamentation, the appellant\u2019s design was not original at the time of its registration. There was in it no new idea, nor any new way of applying old designs to manufactured articles of a class which was not analogous. The appellant\u2019s design was, therefore, not proper subject-matter for registration.\nIn appellant\u2019s factum a further question is raised, namely, that as the appellant\u2019s design is registered the validity of the registration can only be attacked by proceedings, taken under s. 42, to expunge the entry in the register. In my opinion, this objection is answered by Lindley, L.J., in In re Clarke\u2019s Design (1), where he said:\u2014\nThe only protection afforded to the public against an abuse of the Act and the acquisition of mischievous monopolies for designs which are neither new nor original, but which have escaped the vigilance of the comptroller and been improperly registered., is the protection of a Court when its aid is invoked by the registered owner of the design against an alleged infringer, or by a person aggrieved who (applies * * * to expunge a registered design from the register.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Caudwell & Symmes.\nSolicitors for the respondent: McPherson & Co.\n[1] [1928] Ex.

The contract between each producer and the Association, which is set out in full, and the other material facts, and the grounds taken by the appellant against the assessment, sufficiently appear in the judgment now reported. The appeal was dismissed with costs.\nLewis Duncan for the appellant.\nC. Fraser Elliott K.C. and W. S. Fisher for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDuff J.\u2014The appellant company is incorporated under the Agricultural Associations Act of the Province of British Columbia. The Association has share capital. Persons may be admitted to membership, who are resident of the Fraser Valley, west of Yale, producers of milk and subscribers for at least ten shares, and who execute the Association's agreement respecting the sale of milk and cream through the Association. No shareholder may hold less than ten or more than three hundred shares. A shareholder may withdraw from the Association, with the consent of the directors, if he ceases to produce in the territory, and, on the surrender of his certificate, is entitled to a refund of the amount paid up on his shares. Shares are to be paid for in cash, and the directors are entitled to make calls in respect of unpaid balances on shares. The dividends received by shareholders are proportioned to the amounts paid on their shares.\nThe contract executed by producers is in the following words:\u2014\nWhereas the Producer has requested the Association to accept for distribution and sale on his behalf, all the milk and\/or cream produced by the Producer during the life of this agreement, which the Association has agreed to do.\nNow therefore this Agreement witnesseth: That in consideration of the outlays and expenses incurred and to be incurred by the Association in providing means for handling, manufacturing and marketing the milk and dairy products of the Producer as mentioned herein, the said parties have agreed to, and do hereby agree as follows:\u2014\n1. The Producer agrees to forward to the Association, or as it may direct, all milk and\/or cream produced by the Producer other than that retained by him for his own personal or family use, for a continuous period from the date hereof until he shall retire absolutely from the dairy business, in the lower mainland of British Columbia, subject to cancellation by a twelve months' notice which may be given by either party to the other to terminate this agreement while the Producer is still carrying on dairying in the aforementioned district, the contract to terminate at the expiration of said notice: Provided always that the Producer will endeavour to follow the instructions of the Association as to the proportionate quantities of milk to be produced during the several months of the year, in order that the natural surplus in the spring may be reduced as much as possible.\n2. The Producer agrees to deliver the said milk and\/or cream to such plant or other place as the Association may from time to time require and that he will be responsible for the condition of the said milk and\/or cream until the same is accepted at such plant or other place by the Association, or by such person or persons as may be appointed by the Association in that behalf.\n3. The Association agrees with the Producer to receive from him all the said milk and\/or cream produced by him and to sell the same, as may be deemed by the management of the Association to be most advantageous to all members thereof and to pool the proceeds of all sales on behalf of all Producers delivering to the Association and to distribute the same to such Producers on the basis of the butter fat content f.o.b. Vancouver (reducing the price of such butter fat content f.o.b. Vancouver where the amounts paid for delivery have been less than the cost of delivery at Vancouver, by an equitable difference (according to market prices obtained for sour cream, sweet cream, and whole milk Provided always that from and out of the moneys realized from the sale of milk and\/or cream during the term of this agreement the Association may deduct and retain from month to month such amounts for the purposes of the Association as its Directors may from time to time decide, which amounts shall not exceed in all 10 per cent, of the amount realized from the sale of the said milk and\/or cream, and said amounts so deducted and retained by the Association together with similar amounts deducted and retained by the Association from all other Producers delivering to the Association shall be a fund in the hands of the Association to be expended 'as follows:\u2014\n(a) To provide for all losses, costs, charges and expenses incurred by the Association in carrying on its business together with a reasonable allowance for depreciation of all plants and equipment.\n(b) To establish a reserve fund as may be required by the provisions off the \"Co-operative Associations Act\" as in force here from time to time.\n(c) For the purpose of paying a cash dividend on the paid-up shares in the capital stock of the Association at such rate as may be fixed by the said Association in annual general meeting, such dividend not to exceed eight per centum per annum.\n(d) The directors may retain from such fund after the foregoing subsections have been complied with, such amounts as the directors may deem 'advisable for the purpose of purchasing any land, buildings, machinery or equipment, or in making any other investment or investments which they may deem for the benefit of the Association, Provided always that such expenditure in any year shall not exceed 2\u00bd per cent, of the total amount realized from all sales of milk and\/or cream during such year; unless the expenditure of a larger amount be authorized by a special general meeting of the Association called for that purpose, in which case the Producer hereby agrees to be bound by the decision of such meeting whether he be present or not. Upon the completion of any such purchase or investment the Association shall issue paid-up shares to the extent of the capital sum expended and shall issue to each Producer and each Producer agrees to accept his proportion of said shares being that proportion which the value of the butter fat calculated f.o.b. Vancouver, shipped by him during such year bears to the total amount expended by the Association under this subsection.\n(e) Any balance remaining over, shall be disposed of in such manner as shall be decided by the members of the Association in Annual General Meeting, and the Producer hereby agrees to be bound by the decision of such meeting, whether he be present or not.\n4. The tests for butter fat content shall be made by persons holding Government certificates' of qualification and shall be subject to the provisions of the Creameries and Dairies Regulation Act.\n5. The Association agrees to make payment semimonthly for all milk and\/or cream received, subject to the provisions herein contained, about the middle and end of each and every month during the life of this agreement, or at such periods as may be fixed by the Association in annual general meeting.\n6. While doing its best to provide sufficient empty cans to every member for use in shipping milk and\/or cream, the Association is not to be held responsible for the failure of any transportation company or milk hauler to leave the requisite number of empty cans for this purpose.\n7. The Producer hereby covenants with the Association that should the said Producer fail to carry out the terms of this agreement by making default in the supply or delivery of the milk and\/or cream within contracted for, he will pay to the Association the sun of twenty cents (20 cents) for each pound of butter fat not delivered by reason of the said milk and\/or cream being not delivered, and such amount shall be held to be 'liquidated damages for such non-delivery and not as a penalty.\nThe financial report of the company, for the year 1923, showed that there was, from the operations of the company for that year, a balance of $39,953.34, which admittedly has been distributed among the shareholders. In respect of the sum of $32,000 odd, which is arrived at by deducting certain allowances from this balance, it has been held by Audette J.[2] that the appellants are assessable to income tax as taxable income received during the year 1923. From this judgment the appellants now appeal.\nThe judgment of Audette J. is assailed on two grounds: First, that this sum was not received by the appellants in the year 1923; and, secondly, if so received, it is not assessable to income tax.\nTo deal first with the second of these contentions. Both the statute, under which the appellants are organized, and the appellants, own rules contemplate the distribution of profits to the shareholders of the Association as such. Section 13 of the Co-operative Associations Act, Chapter 19, B.C. Statutes of 1920, is in these words:\u2014\n13. (1) The profits from the business of an association shall be apportioned as follows:\u2014\n(a) By setting aside such sum as its rules may provide, not being less than ten per cent, of the net profits, as a reserve fund, until such fund is equal to at least thirty per cent, of the share capital paid up at the date of the apportiontment.\n(b) By payment of such dividend as its rules may provide, not exceeding eight per cent per annum, on the share capital paid up at the date of the apportionment.\n(c) By distributing, in accordance with the rules of the association, among its patrons, whether members or not and whether vendors to or purchasers from the association, the remaining profits, or such portion thereof as the association may provide.\nThe statute treats the Association as a profit-making concern, and as a profit-making concern it is contemplated by the contract. The contract provides for the deduction for moneys, realized from the sale of milk and cream, and the retention by the Association, from month to month, of such amounts not exceeding ten per cent, of the sums so realized, as the directors may from time to time decide, for the purposes of the Association. These moneys deducted and retained 'b\ny the Association \"for the purposes of the Association \" are to be expended:\u2014\n(1) In providing for all losses, costs, charges and expenses of the business of the Association, including an allowance for depreciation of plant and equipment,\n(2) in establishing a reserve fund in compliance with the statute,\n(3) in payment of a \" cash dividend \" to the shareholders of the Association, at such rate as shall be \" fixed by the said Association, not exceeding eight per cent, per annum,\"\n(4) as to any surplus, after providing for these requirements, in paying a sum, not to exceed 2\u00bd per cent. of the total moneys realized, in the purchase of lands, buildings, machinery or equipment, or \"in making any other investment,\" deemed to be \"for the benefit of the Association\"; and in disposing of any balance of the surplus in such manner as the Association may determine in annual general meeting.\nMoneys distributed among the shareholders by way of dividend, pursuant to the terms of this contract, are moneys paid out of profits\u2014profits assessable to income tax. The contention of the appellants, however, is that the scheme as a whole is a co-operative scheme; and that the Association is incorporated for the purpose of providing convenient machinery for putting this scheme into effect. The appellants are, it is said, a mere agency, and, the profits, so called, distributed among the shareholders, constitute, in part, the returns received by the appellants in that character, which, in the form of dividends, or interest on paid-up capital, are handed over to the producers.\nIt seems impossible to accept this view. It is quite clear that the moneys distributed, as dividends, or among shareholders as interest on paid-up capital, are not divided among the producers, unless by .accident, in the same proportion as the share of moneys realized from sales, which is paid directly to producers from month to month, under the terms of the contract. The share of each producer in the moneys so distributed is determined by the butter fat content of his product; while his share of moneys distributed, by way of dividend or interest, is determined by the amount he has paid on his shares. Moreover, while it is intended, no doubt, that the number of shares held shall bear a definite relation to the number of cans of milk supplied by the shareholder to the Association, that relation is not necessarily maintained, as the following evidence shows:\u2014\nQ. Supposing we had a shipper who shipped one can of milk but he only held five shares, and we have another who ships one can of milk but he has three hundred shares; you say the money all goes to the shipper and they are synonymous?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Do they get the same amount of money?\nA. No.\nQ. Where is the difference?\nA. The man with bigger shipments would get more.\nQ. The shipments are both the same?\nA. The man who has more capital in the company would get more interest.\nOn the whole it seems impossible to treat the distribution of moneys under clause 3 (c) of the contract as a mere accounting by the appellants, as agents, to their principals. Admittedly, by the contract, the moneys realized from the sale of milk and cream, were to be distributed \"about the middle and the end of each month,\" or at such periods as might be fixed by the Association, subject to the monthly deduction above mentioned, which is not to exceed ten per cent. of the total amount realized from sales. Moneys retained, which remained in the hands of the Association at the end of the year 1923, could only be retained in virtue of the proviso to the third paragraph of the agreement, which authorized the retention of moneys \"for the purposes of the Association.\" The destination of the moneys, so retained, is explicitly fixed by the terms of the agreement itself. Only in payment of a cash dividend is the distribution of any part of such moneys among the shareholders authorized, and this only after the expenses, incurred by the Association \"in carrying on its business,\" have been provided for.\nAs to the first contention. The terms of the contract seem to conclude the point against the appellants. The appellants' argument is that the balance of $39,000 odd, which was distributed after the annual meeting of February, 1924, consisted of the undistributed proceeds of sales in the year 1923. These moneys, as part of such proceeds, could only be retained rightfully under the terms of the proviso, paragraph 3; and, therefore, we are entitled, and indeed bound, to presume that they were, from month to month, deducted and retained by the Association, pursuant to those terms, that is to say, \" for the purposes of the Association,\" and, moreover, that the distribution among the shareholders was made in conformity with the obligations of the appellants under the contract. The proper inference, therefore, is that these moneys were received by the appellants, for their own purposes, in the year 1923.\nThe appeal is to be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Lewis Duncan.\nSolicitor for the respondent: C.

Appellant had a registered specific trade-mark \u201cCameo Soap\u201d to be used in connection with the sale of soap, and for many years had manufactured and sold a yellow bar soap under that name. There is a distinction broadly observed in the soap trade between \u201claundry soap\u201d and \u201ctoilet soap,\u201d depending largely upon shape, dimensions, and convenience or indication for use; but some soaps classified as \u201claundry soaps\u201d are extensively used for toilet purposes, and laundry soaps and toilet soaps are largely sold by the same dealers. Appellant\u2019s said soap, although listed in its catalogues and price lists, and known in the trade, as a \u201claundry soap,\u201d was extensively used also for toilet purposes. In February, 1927, appellant decided to produce and sell a white soap in cake form suitable for toilet purposes, and to use in connection therewith said trade-mark. This soap was first announced in its catalogue in January, 1928. Respondent had, in 1926, applied for, and in January, 1927, obtained, in the United States, registration of the word \u201cCamay\u201d as a specific trade-mark for \u201ctoilet soap\u201d; and in May, 1927, applied in Canada to register \u201cCamay\u201d as a specific trade-mark to be used in connection with the sale of a \u201ctoilet and bath soap,\u201d which application was refused because of appellant\u2019s registered trademark. In an application and an action by respondent in the Exchequer Court, orders were made for registration of its trade-mark and for restricting appellant\u2019s trade-mark to laundry soap.\nHeld (1): Appellant\u2019s trade-mark should not be so restricted. Considering the nature of the goods, the uses to which they were put, and the course of the trade in them, it could not be said that \u201claundry soap\u201d and \u201ctoilet and bath soap\u201d are each a \u201cparticular description\u201d of goods, within the meaning of the Trade-Mark and Design Act. The use by other traders of the same trade-mark in respect of any soap would be likely to give rise to deception or confusion, against which the law was intended to give protection. Edwards v. Dennis, 30 Ch. D. 454, and John Batt & Co. v. Dunnett, [1899] A.C. 428, distinguished.\n(2): The refusal by the departmental tribunal to register the word \u201cCamay\u201d as a specific trade-mark should not be disturbed, it not being demonstrably wrong. One challenging its decision must establish affirmatively that if the proposed word is registered deception will not result. On this question it is the ultimate purchasers who are to be considered. That the word \u201cCamay,\u201d when vocalized, has a strong similarity to the French word \u201ccam\u00e9e,\u201d was, in view of conditions in this country, a fact to be considered.\n(3): Appellant should not be held to have lost its rights by using on its yellow bar soap the name of its predecessors in title, whose assets it had purchased.\nJudgment of Maclean J., [1928] Ex. C.R. 207, reversed.\nAPPEAL by Pugsley, Dingman & Company, Limited (objecting party in the one proceeding, and defendant in the other proceeding) from the judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], holding that the respondent, The Proctor & Gamble Company (petitioner in the one proceeding, and plaintiff in the other proceeding), was entitled to have registered in the Department of Secretary of State of the Dominion of Canada in the register of Trade-Marks the specific trade-mark consisting of the word \u201cCamay\u201d to be used in connection with the manufacture and sale of toilet and bath soaps; and that the registered trade-mark of the said appellant, consisting of the words \u201cCameo Soap,\u201d should be restricted to laundry soap only, and the register of Trade-Marks be rectified accordingly.\nThe one proceeding was an application by the respondent to the Exchequer Court of Canada for an order for the registration of the word \u201cCamay\u201d as a specific trade-mark, applicable to a toilet and bath soap, the respondent\u2019s application for registration of the same having been refused by the Commissioner of Patents; and the other proceeding was an action by the respondent for an order expunging the entry of the registration by the appellant of the specific trade-mark \u201cCameo Soap,\u201d or, in the alternative, varying the said entry by restricting it to laundry soap.\nThe material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. As to the last point mentioned in the judgment, the reference is to the use by the appellant on its yellow bar soap of the name of its predecessors in title, a company whose assets it had purchased and which had ceased to carry on business.\nThe appeals were allowed, and the orders of the trial judge set aside, with costs to the appellant throughout.\nR. C. H. Cassels K.C. for the appellant.\nO. M. Biggar K.C. and R. S. Smart K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDuff J.\u2014These are two appeals from two orders of the President of the Exchequer Court, one made in a proceeding by way of appeal from the Commissioner of Patents who rejected an application of the respondents for the registration of the word \u201cCamay\u201d as a trade-mark for toilet and bath soap, directing the registration of the trade-mark, the other made in an action by the respondents claiming rectification of the registry of the appellants\u2019 trade-mark \u201cCameo Soap\u201d by limiting that mark to laundry soap, granting the relief claimed. In 1900, the words \u201cCameo Soap\u201d were registered in the name of the Imperial Soap Co. Ltd. as a specific trade-mark to be applied to the sale of soap. In 1902, the appellants purchased all the assets of the Imperial Soap Co. Ltd. (who thereupon ceased to carry on business), including said trade-mark, a formal assignment of which was executed in 1902 and registered in the Department of Agriculture in 1906. In December, 1925, the registration of the trade-mark having expired under the law, an application was made by the appellants to register a specific trade-mark to be used in connection with the sale of soap, consisting of the words \u201cCameo Soap,\u201d and this trade-mark was registered on the 11th of January, 1926. From the date of the acquisition of the trade-mark from its immediate predecessors in title, the appellants have, down to the commencement of these proceedings, manufactured and sold a yellow bar soap under the name \u201cCameo Soap.\u201d In February, 1927, the appellants decided to produce and sell a white soap in the form of a cake suitable for toilet purposes, and to use in connection with the sale thereof, their trade-mark \u201cCameo Soap.\u201d This toilet soap first appeared in their catalogue in January, 1928. In August, 1926, more than twenty-five years after the registration of the mark \u201cCameo Soap,\u201d the respondents applied in the United States for the registration of the word \u201cCamay\u201d as a specific trade-mark for \u201ctoilet soap,\u201d and registration was granted in January, 1927. In May, 1927, the respondents applied to the Commissioner of Patents in Ottawa to register the same word \u201cCamay\u201d as a specific trade-mark to be used in connection with the sale of \u201ctoilet and bath soap.\u201d This application was refused because of the presence on the register of the appellants\u2019 trade-mark. In November, 1926, the respondents commenced to advertise widely their soap \u201cCamay\u201d in the United States, but did not advertise in Canada. Down to the trial in June, 1928, the respondents had not used their trade-mark \u201cCamay\u201d in connection with the sale of soap in Canada.\nIt will be convenient first to consider the order of the learned trial judge rectifying the registration of the appellants\u2019 trade-mark. And at the outset it should be observed that there is by the concurrence of all parties, a distinction broadly observed in the soap trade between laundry soap and toilet soap. The distinction is largely evidenced in price lists and catalogues, and it seems to be quite clear that the term \u201claundry soap\u201d is applied generally to soaps sold in bars or cakes of such shape and dimensions that they cannot be used, conveniently in washing the person, while the words \u201ctoilet soap\u201d are used to designate soaps which are sold in cakes of suitable size, often perfumed and commonly presented in attractive form with some indication of the purpose for which they are recommended by the seller. On the other hand, the use of the term laundry soap does not indicate that the soap to which it is applied is not used for personal purposes. In truth, there is uncontradicted evidence that a number of well known brands of the commoner soaps, which are sold in bars or cakes not immediately adapted for toilet purposes are extensively used for washing the body and for all other household purposes. One soap, known as \u201cSunlight Soap,\u201d is mentioned in the evidence which the principal witness for the respondent seemed to consider was sold in such a form as to bring it within the classification of laundry soap, which undoubtedly is very widely bought in this country for every purpose for which a soap can be used; and it is not disputed that the yellow bar soap to which the appellants have applied their trade-mark \u201cCameo Soap\u201d for more than twenty-five years, has always been bought and used extensively for the purpose of washing the body as well as for laundry purposes. It may be observed also that Castile soap, which is used almost exclusively for toilet purposes, and which the appellants list sometimes as toilet soap, sometimes as Castile soap simply, seems to be sometimes sold in large bars and in that form advertised as toilet soap.\nThe learned trial judge has held that, for the purposes of trade-mark registration, toilet soap and laundry soap belong to descriptions of goods \u201cabsolutely different\u201d; and on this ground has held, applying the principle I am about to mention, that the registration of the appellants\u2019 trade-mark should be rectified in the manner mentioned[2].\nBy s. 4 (c) of the Trade-Mark and Design Act, \u201cspecific trade-mark\u201d means a trade-mark used in connection with the sale of a \u201cclass merchandise of a particular description.\u201d I shall assume for the purposes of the appeal, though I shall express no opinion whatever on the point, that the registered owner of a \u201cspecific trade-mark\u201d is not entitled to prevent the registration of the identical trademark or a closely resembling one by another trader, where that trader does not seek registration in respect of the same description of goods, or of goods of such a like description that the subsequent registration might lead to deception or confusion.\nThe respondents invoke the authority of the court under s. 45 (formerly s. 42) of the Act. Under that section the court has power to expunge or vary any entry \u201cmade without sufficient cause\u201d in the register, and this jurisdiction has been held to empower the court to expunge the registration of a trade-mark where registration ought not to have been granted, or to rectify the terms of such registration when it is of a character to which the applicant was not entitled.\nThe contention of the respondents, which prevailed with the learned trial judge, is that the appellants\u2019 predecessors in title were not entitled to register their trade-mark in respect of soap generally, but only in respect of \u201claundry\u201d soap. This contention is based upon a principle laid down by the Court of Appeal in Edwards v. Dennis[3], and afterwards by the House of Lords in John Batt & Co. v. Dunnett[4], in which it was held that under the English Act then in force, where a trade-mark is registered by a trader, in respect of one of the numbered classes of goods defined by that Act, and that class includes things of a variety of descriptions, and it appears that at the time of the registration the trader was dealing in only one of those descriptions of goods, and had no intention of dealing in any other, the registration of his trade-mark ought to be restricted by excluding the descriptions of goods in respect of which he was not carrying on business. Later, this principle was extended to the case in which the trader, although dealing in the particular description of goods in question, had, at the time of the registration of the trade-mark, never applied his mark to such description of goods, and had no intention of so applying it. I assume in the discussion which follows, although I wish to leave the question entirely open if it should arise for decision, that a title to a trade-mark may, under the Canadian Act, be acquired by registration under the Act, although prior to registration the trader has never made use of the trade-mark. This must, however, be subject to the qualification that a specific trade-mark cannot be acquired in respect of a \u201cparticular description of goods\u201d within the meaning of s. 4 of the Act, where the applicant has not made use of the mark in respect of that \u201cdescription of goods\u201d and has at the time of his application no present definite intention of doing so. It is obvious enough that the application of this qualification may raise questions of some nicety as to what use of the trade-mark or intended use of one constitutes for the purpose of the rule a use in connection with a given \u201cparticular description of goods.\u201d\nThe onus is, of course, on the respondents, but the facts are not really in dispute. It is not denied that neither the appellants nor the appellants\u2019 predecessors in title, prior to the application for registration in 1900 or to the application in 1926, made use of the trade-mark \u201cCameo Soap\u201d in connection with any kind of soap other than the yellow bar soap mentioned, or that at the time of either of these applications, the applicant had no present definite intention of using it in connection with any other kind of soap. This yellow bar soap was, and is, as I have said, listed by the appellants in their catalogues and price-lists as a \u201claundry soap,\u201d and is known in the trade as such.\nThe respondents\u2019 contention is that laundry soap is a \u201cparticular description of goods\u201d within the meaning of the Act, that toilet and bath soap is another description of goods within the meaning of the Act, and that registration in respect of soap generally cannot be acquired by an applicant, who has used and only intends to use his trade-mark in respect of a soap which is known in the trade as laundry soap or toilet soap. The appellants, on the other hand, contend that the use of their trade-mark in connection with a kind of soap, which, though known in the trade as laundry soap, is used for all the purposes of a soap and is purchased for all such purposes, is manufactured and sold to supply a market largely including such purchasers to the knowledge of everyone who deals in it, gives them a title to that trade-mark which cannot be adequately protected when the registration is limited to laundry soap; and that the effect of the decision of the learned President of the Exchequer Court, as to the owner of trade-marks used in connection with soaps to which the appellants\u2019 yellow bar soap belongs (soap sold in bars, a form which brings it under the trade denomination of laundry soap, but used by purchasers for all purposes), is to deprive him of the protection which the law is intended to give him.\nObviously, it is said, a soap which, though sold in a form bringing it under the description of \u201claundry soap\u201d is used for toilet and bath purposes very extensively, as, for example, the evidence shows the soap known as \u201cSunlight Soap,\u201d is, has a market for such purposes. It is a laundry soap according to the trade classification referred to (and that because the operation of cutting the large bars into smaller pieces suitable for toilet purposes is left to the customer), but for every other purpose it is a toilet and bath soap as well as a laundry soap. In such a case, it is argued, if you limit the registration of the trade-mark to laundry soap (soap sold in large pieces), you deprive the owner of the trade-mark of the statutory protection under s. 19, where the infringement consists in the use of the trademark in respect of soap prepared and sold in a form suited only for use as a toilet soap; and may materially limit the protection he would otherwise enjoy under the Common Law (s. 20). It would, it is said, be difficult to reconcile such a result with the fundamental considerations upon which trade-mark law rests. The rules of law in that respect are intended to protect the interest of the public in not being misled as to the source of the goods which it purchases, as well as the interest of the owner of the trademark in the market he has acquired among people for whom the trade-mark stands as a symbol of goods dealt in by him, his interest in his reputation as a producer or dealer connected with his trade-mark, and his interest in the distinctiveness of the trade-mark itself. These interests the Act also is designed to protect; and it is contended that the decision appealed from has the effect of impairing that protection. I think the respondents have failed to establish the proposition upon which their contention rests. Soaps which, according to the trade classification, fall within the designation \u201claundry soap\u201d are used, purchased and sold in fact, for every purpose for which soap can be used; and such soaps are sold by the same dealers as those who sell soap used for toilet purposes exclusively. The evidence is that 85% of toilet soaps are sold by grocers. They are bought by the same persons, used in the same households, and the trade distinction does not appear to be based upon any difference in composition. It would, I think, be greatly straining the application of such cases as Edwards v. Dennis[5] to give effect to the respondents\u2019 contention.\nThe only object of limiting the registration of a trademark by excluding descriptions of goods to which it has never been applied, is to clear the field for the purpose of enabling other traders to make use of the same trade-mark or a similar trade-mark, in respect of such last mentioned descriptions of goods, or to obtain registration of some such trade-mark in respect of such goods. I find it difficult to suppose on what grounds, in view of what I have already said, the Commissioner could satisfy himself, on such an application, that the registration of the trade-mark \u201cCameo\u201d in respect to toilet and bath soaps, would not create risk of confusion and deception, even when the appellants\u2019 trade-mark is limited to laundry soap. In view of the fact that the appellants, even under the restriction, would be entitled to use their trade-mark in respect of any soap falling within the trade description, that is to say, any soap sold in forms and sizes inconvenient for personal use, although largely in fact bought for and applied to such purposes, I cannot suppose that such registration would be permitted. Nor can I understand on what ground the appellants can fairly be deprived of protection against the reasonable possibility of deception and confusion arising from the use by other traders of their trade-mark in respect of any soap whether known in the trade as laundry or as toilet soap.\nThe question of what degree of similarity between given descriptions of goods is calculated to give rise to deception or confusion has arisen in a great variety of cases; in these cases the tribunals have applied themselves to considerations as to the course of the trade in the goods in relation to sellers and purchasers, to the nature of the goods and to the uses to which they are put. In re the Australian Wine Importers\u2019 Trade-Mark[6]; the Motricine case (In re the Application of the Compagnie Industrielle des Petroles to Register a Trade-Mark)[7]; the Egall case (In re Application by Egg Products Ltd. for a Trade-Mark)[8]; In re Application of Gutta-Percha & Rubber Mfg. Co. of Toronto Ltd.[9]; In re McDowell\u2019s application[10]; In re Shreeve\u2019s Trade-Mark[11]. To these various considerations I have already adverted.\nThe persons to be primarily considered in determining any such question, are the ultimate purchasers. In re Warschauer\u2019s Application[12], and Bowden Wire Ltd. v. Bowden Brake Co. Ltd[13].\nFor these reasons, I think that the appeal from the order rectifying the appellants\u2019 registration should succeed.\nAs to the other appeal, the question is a question of fact, and the view of the Departmental Tribunal is one which ought not to be interfered with unless it is demonstrably wrong. It is incumbent upon the party challenging the decision of that Tribunal to establish affirmatively, that if the proposed mark is registered, deception will not result from it. In considering this question, it is the ultimate purchaser who is to be considered, and such purchasers may largely consist of ill-informed people. The question is a practical question. I am satisfied that the appellants are on sound ground in calling attention to the fact that the proposed word, when vocalized, has a strong similarity to the French word \u201ccam\u00e9e,\u201d and that in this country there are many thousands of people who, almost every day of their lives, employ both English and French in the ordinary business of life. I am not at all prepared to say that it would be wrong to conclude that if a soap came to be well known among such people as \u201cCameo Soap,\u201d it would be described indifferently as \u201cCameo\u201d and \u201cCam\u00e9e.\u201d The wrapper produced before us, which may or may not have been before the Commissioner, suggests that the word \u201cCamay\u201d is not in the minds of those who adopted it wholly unconnected with the idea of \u201cCameo.\u201d I am unable to follow the contention that in the circumstances the French word is not to be considered.\nThis appeal ought also to be allowed.\nReference should also be made to a point, rather faintly suggested, that the appellants have lost their rights by the use of the name of the Imperial Soap Co. The appellants, having purchased the assets, which, prima facie, include the goodwill, of their predecessors, were entitled to make use of their predecessors\u2019 name, unless there was something in the circumstances of the transfer to them depriving them of that right. Churton v. Douglas (1); Levy v. Walker (2). Such a point, if it was to be taken, should have been raised explicitly in the pleadings.\nBoth appeals should be allowed with costs here and in the Exchequer Court.\nAppeals allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Blake, Lash, Anglin & Cassels.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Smart & Biggar.\n[1] [1928] Ex.

V, c. 100; (N.S.) (1924) c. 122.\nThe St. Luke\u2019s Presbyterian Congregation of Salt Springs in the County of Ptictou, was a congregation in connection with the Presbyterian Church in Canada. Under the provisions of \u201cThe United Church of Canada Act\u201d (Can.) it voted on December 22, 1924, not to concur in union. The minister, Rev. S. C. Walls, who was in the minority, resigned. On May 5, 1925, the Presbytery of Pictou (the appellant congregation being within its bounds), appointed one Rev. Robert Johnston of New Glasgow, N.S., interim (pro tempore) moderator of its session, and until after July 27, 1925, no minister was inducted to the charge. In that month, requisitions were signed by a large number of the members of the congregation asking the elders to convene a congregational meeting for the purpose of taking a second vote under the provisions of \u201cThe United Church of Canada Act\u201d (N.S.). Some of the elders called a meeting for the 27th of July. One hundred of those who attended voted to become part of the United Church; none opposing. Members opposed to union then brought this action for a declaration inter alia that the meeting and proceedings so taken were null and void; that the congregation is a Presbyterian congregation and not a congregation of or in connection with the United Church of Canada.\nHeld, Duff J. dissenting, that, under the circumstances of this case and in view of the enactments of the federal and provincial Acts respecting the United Church of Canada, the vote given at the meeting of the 27th of Judy, 1925, was ineffective to carry either the congregation or its property into the Union.\nPer Newcombe, Rinfret and Smith JJ.\u2014The power of non-concurrence which the appellant congregation duly exercised under the Dominion Act, having been invoked with affirmative consequences, was exhausted and could not be reviewed by the congregation. Moreover, a meeting of non-concurrence is held under the authority of \u201cThe United Church of Canada Act,\u201d and should be held before the union comes into force. It is, for the purposes of this case, a meeting of a congregation of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, and, in the absence of any express statutory provision, the regulations of that church applicable to holding a congregational meeting in like circumstances were apt to regulate the meeting for which the statute provides. Rule 19 of the Rules and Forms of Procedure of the Presbyterian Church in Canada requires that meetings of the congregation shall be called by the authority of the Session, which may act of its own motion or on requisition in writing of the Deacons\u2019 Court or Board of Managers, or of a number of persons in full communion, or by mandate of a superior court, and rule 50 reiterates that it is the duty of the Session \u201cto call congregational meetings.\u201d These rules were not followed as to the meeting of 27th July, and there was no antecedent meeting of the Session, but, moreover, by s. 10 (d), the United Church of Canada Act specially provides that a meeting of the congregation for the purposes of expressing non-concurrence may be called by authority of the Session of its own motion, and shall be called by the Session on requisition to it in writing of twenty-five members entitled to vote, in congregations, such as this, having over 100, and not more than 500 members. There was no compliance with these provisions, and in consequence the meeting of 27th July was not regularly called or held, and consequently, if for no other reason, it failed of its purpose.\nPer Anglin C.J.C. and Smith J.\u2014The meeting of the 27th of July, 1925, was professedly called under the last sentence of clause (a) of s. 8 of the Nova Scotia Act. There is no corresponding provision in the Dominion Act. The resolution for concurrence passed at that meet- ing could not bring about the entry of the congregation into the incorporated body known as \u201cThe United Church of Canada,\u201d since that body is a Dominion corporation. While the property of the congregation might possibly be affected, the congregation did not thereby become part of The United Church of Canada. Under the constating Act of that body corporate (s. 10) the congregation of Saltsprings had definitely, and apparently irrevocably, voted itself out of the Union on the 22nd of December, 1924. But assuming that, by virtue of the Nova Scotia Act of 1925, the vote for non-.concurrence taken in December, 1924, should be deemed for all purposes of the Nova Scotia Act of 1924 to be a vote taken under and in conformity with the earlier provisions of s. 8 (a) of the latter Act, nevertheless the resolution voted on the 27th of July, 1925, being ineffective to bring the Saltsprings Congregation into the Union, its only avowed purpose, it could not operate indirectly to affect the property held by the defendant trustees for such congregation. If it did, that property would thereafter be held by the trustees for a body legally non-existent, i.e., The Presbyterian Congregation of Saltsprings in connection or communion with the United Church of Canada. That the legislature contemplated or intended any such anomalous result is inconceivable. Moreover, the only decision at which the last sentence of clause (a) of s. 8 purports to authorize the meeting, for which it provides, to arrive is \u201cto enter the Union and become part of the United Church.\u201d The application of the Act \u201cto the congregation and all the property thereof\u201d is manifestly dependent on such \u201cdecision\u201d being effectively made. Inefficacious to cause the congregation to become part of the United Church, the resolution for concurrence could not bring about the application of the Nova Scotia Act either to the congregation or to its property.\nJudgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc, (59 N.S. Rep. 272) aff., Duff J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, en banc,[1], reversing the judgment of Harris C.J., and maintaining the respondent\u2019s action claiming a declaration that a meeting of the Congregation of Saltsprings, held on or about July 27, 1925, to consider entering the United Church of Canada, was null and void and of no effect.\nThe material facts of the case are fully stated in the judgments now reported.\nH. McInnes K.C. and G. W. Mason K.C for the appellants.\nH. P. MacKeen for the respondents.\nAnglin C.J.C.\u2014I have had the advantage of reading the carefully prepared opinion of my brother Newcombe. While I concur in his disposition of this appeal, its dismissal can, in my opinion, be rested on a short and simple ground, not taken at bar, but so obvious from a consideration of the statutes that to direct re-argument upon it would seem unnecessary.\nThe Dominion statute, 1924, (14-15 Geo. V, c. 100), alone provides for the incorporation of the United Church of Canada, a Dominion-wide body. The provincial statute of Nova Scotia (c. 122 of the year 1924) of course makes no provision for incorporation and deals chiefly with matters affecting property.\nThe Dominion Act, by section 10, provides for a meeting of \u201cany congregation in connection or communion with any of the negotiating churches\u201d being held \u201cat any time within six months before the coming into force of the Act,\u201d at which a majority of the persons present and entitled to vote may decide \u201cnot to enter the said Union of the said Churches.\u201d While s. 2 of the Dominion Act, which was assented to on the 19th of July, 1924, provides that the Act as a whole is not to come into force until the 10th of June, 1925, it also expressly provides that s. 10 thereof shall come into force on the 10th of December, 1924.\nSection 29 of the Nova Scotia Act reads as follows:\n29. This Act shall come into force on the day upon which the United Church shall be incorporated by Act of the Parliament of Canada, provided that the said date in respect of the whole of this Act or any section or sections thereof may be altered to such date or dates as shall be fixed by proclamation of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council to be made upon the request of the sub-committee on Law and Legislation of the joint committee on Church Union to be evidenced by the hands of its chairman and secretary.\nNo proclamation bringing into force the whole or any section or sections of this Act was referred to in argument, nor have I been able to find any such proclamation in the Royal Gazette of Nova Scotia. It would seem, therefore, that the Nova Scotia Act came into force only on the 10th of June, 1925.\nThe Congregation of St. Luke\u2019s Presbyterian Church at Saltsprings held a meeting, now admittedly regularly called, on the 22nd of December, 1924, at which a majority of those present and qualified to vote decided \u201cnot to enter the said Union of the said churches.\u201d Obviously, this meeting was held under s. 10 of the Dominion Act, as s. 8 of the provincial Act did not come into force until the 10th of June, 1925.\nClause (a) of section 8 of the Nova Scotia Act reads as follows: 8. (a) Provided always, that if any congregation in connection or communion with any of the negotiating churches shall, at a meeting of the congregation regularly called and held within six months after the coming into force of this section, decide by a majority of votes of the persons present at such meeting and entitled to vote thereat, not to concur in the said union of the said churches, then and in such case the property, real and personal, belonging to or held in trust for or to the use of such non-concurring congregation shall be held by the existing trustees, or other trustees elected by the congregation for the sole benefit of said congregation. Should such congregation decide in the manner aforesaid at any later time to enter the union and become part of the United Church, then this Act shall apply to the congregation and all the property thereof from the date of such decision.\nIn 1925 the Legislature of Nova Scotia, by c. 167, amended its Act of 1924 and enacted this declaratory section:\n1. Any vote on the question of entering the said union taken in a congregation prior to the coming into force in pursuance of and in accordance with the provisions of the Act of incorporation, shall be deemed to be the vote of such congregation for the purposes of this Act.\nThe manifest purpose of this provision was to make \u201cany vote on the question of entering the said union\u201d taken under the authority of s. 10 of the Dominion Act of 1924 of the same efficacy for the purposes of the Nova Scotia Act, as if such vote had been taken under and in conformity with the earlier provisions of s. 8 (a) above quoted.\nSubsequently, on the 27th of July, 1925, another meeting was held, the regularity of which the respondents challenge, but at which a majority of those present decided to enter the Union and become part of the United Church. This meeting was professedly called under the last sentence of clause (a) of s. 8 of the Nova Scotia Act. There is no corresponding provision in the Dominion Act. Obviously, if effective for any purpose, the resolution for concurrence passed at that meeting could not bring about the entry of the congregation into the incorporated body known as \u201cThe United Church of Canada,\u201d since that body is a Dominion corporation. It would follow, if there were no other objection to the validity of the transactions of the meeting, that, while the property of the congregation might possibly be affected in some way by such resolution, the congregation itself did not thereby become part of The United Church of Canada. Under the constating Act of that body corporate (s. 10) the congregation of Saltsprings had definitely, and under the provisions of the Dominion Act apparently irrevocably, voted itself out of the Union on the 22nd of December, 1924. But for the amending Act of 1925, there would have been a deeper objection to the efficacy of what was done at the meeting of the 27th of July, 1925. The last sentence of, clause (a) of s. 8 of the Nova Scotia Act deals with \u201csuch congregation,\u201d i.e., a congregation which had already held a meeting under the earlier provision of clause (a) of s. 8, and thereat voted non-concurrence. But no such meeting was ever held because s. 8 only came into force on the 10th of June, 1925, and the only meeting at which non-concurrence was voted had been held on the 22nd of December, 1924, exclusively under the authority of the Dominion Act. To the congregation of St. Luke\u2019s Presbyterian Church at Saltsprings, the last sentence of clause (a) of s. 8, therefore, could not apply, unless by virtue of the legislation of 1925. Consequently the meeting of the 27th of July, 1925, could not have been validly held under that provision. Nor can any meeting under the earlier part of clause (a) of s. 8 be now held, since that clause prescribes that such a meeting must be held within six months after the coming into force of the statute, i.e., before the 10th of December, 1925.\nBut, assuming that, by virtue of the Nova Scotia Act of 1925, the vote for non-concurrence taken in December, 1924, should be deemed for all purposes of the Nova Scotia Act of 1924 to be a vote taken under and in conformity with the earlier provisions of s. 8 (a) of the latter Act, nevertheless the resolution voted on the 27th of July, 1925, being ineffective to bring the Saltsprings Congregation into the Union, and to make it a constituent part of the Dominion Corporation, \u201cThe United Church of Canada,\u201d its only avowed purpose, it cannot operate indirectly to affect the property held by the defendant trustees for such congregation. If it had any such operation that property would thereafter be held by the trustees for a body legally non-existent, i.e., The Presbyterian Congregation of Saltsprings in connection or communion with the United Church of Canada. That the legislature contemplated or intended any such anomalous result is inconceivable. Moreover, the only decision at which the last sentence of clause (a) of s. 8 purports to authorize the meeting, for which it provides, to arrive is \u201cto enter the Union and become part of the United Church.\u201d The application of the Act \u201cto the congregation and all the property thereof\u201d is manifestly dependent on such \u201cdecision\u201d being effectively made. Wholly inefficacious to cause the congregation \u201cto enter the Union and become part of the United Church,\u201d the resolution for concurrence, which the meeting purported to pass, cannot bring about the application of the Nova Scotia Act either to the congregation or to its property.\nOn this ground, therefore, I would affirm the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc in favour of the respondents with the variation in its terms indicated by my brother Newcombe.\nDuff J. (dissenting).\u2014There was no disagreement\u2014and apparently no doubt\u2014in the court below, upon the capacity of a majority of St. Luke\u2019s congregation to take the necessary proceedings to make the congregation a part of the United Church; and to bring the congregation property under the trusts of the model trust deed adopted by the Basis of Union and the Act of Incorporation. Neither was there any doubt as to the power of the United Church to receive St. Luke\u2019s, at the critical date (27th July, 1925), as one of its constituent congregations.\nAs these subjects were not discussed or even touched upon in the argument before us, I should not have adverted to them but for the views in respect of them which form the principal ground of the judgment of the majority of the court.\nFor that reason only, I review briefly the statutory enactments bearing upon these points, before proceeding to the discussion of what I conceive to be the substantial question in controversy. The United Church Act (The Act of Incorporation) (c. 11, 14-15 Geo. V), after reciting that the Presbyterian, Methodist and Congregational Churches had agreed to unite and form one body or denomination of Christians under the name of the \u201cUnited Church of Canada,\u201d declared that the union of these churches should be effective on the day on which the statute should come into force (10th June, 1925). The \u201cChurches\u201d so united included all congregations in communion or in connection with them, except such as should declare their non-concurrence within six months before \u201cthe coming into force of this Act\u201d or within any time limited by the local legislature having jurisdiction over the property of the congregation. On this appeal we are immediately concerned with the effect of this statute (the Act of Incorporation) upon the status and the rights of the non-concurring congregations. Some of its provisions touching upon this subject could only become completely operative under the sanction of provincial legislation, and the Nova Scotia Act of 1924, c. 122, which came into effect on the same date as the Dominion Act (10th of June, 1925) gives in express terms \u201cwith respect to property and civil rights\u201d in Nova Scotia, the force of law to these provisions (s. 27).\nThe effect of the Act of Incorporation in point of law\u2014 and this of course is the only aspect of the legislation with which we are concerned\u2014is not obscure. Such a congregation was, so far as legislative enactment could bring it about, the moment the statute came into operation, segregated from the organized ecclesiastical body or connection to which it belonged, that body having now become absorbed in the United Church; and its congregational property freed from all denominational interest and control and the congregation itself from denominational jurisdiction.\nThe Act of Incorporation contains no explicit provision purporting to enable a non-concurring congregation to reverse its decision and to enter the United Church after the consummation of the Union. But power to receive congregations is given unmistakably to the United Church by s. 18 (j)\n(To do all such lawful Acts or things as may be requisite to carry out the terms, provisions and objects of the Basis of Union and this Act);\nand that power is explicitly recognized by s. 8 of the Act and by article 8 of the Basis of Union.\nI am unable to discern any ground for a contention that after the Union, the United Church was destitute of power to receive the St. Luke\u2019s Congregation as a congregation of that body. The Act of Incorporation does not deal with the subject from the point of view of the non-concurring congregation. In virtue of the Act of Incorporation and the supplementary provincial legislation, such a congregation having, by voting non-concurrence, severed its former denominational connections, its civil rights and property became, as subjects of legislation, merely provincial matters, within the exclusive jurisdiction of the provincial legislature; and accordingly it is to the law of the province of Nova Scotia that we must return to ascertain the scope of the congregation\u2019s rights and the conditions controlling their exercise.\nThe governing enactment is sec. 8 (a) of the Nova Scotia Act of 1924, (C. 122), as amended and interpreted by sec. 1 of the Act of 1925 (C. 167). These enactments are in these words:\n8. (a) Provided always, that if any congregation in connection or communion with any of the negotiating churches shall, at a meeting of the congregation regularly called and held within six months after the coming into force of this section, decide by a majority of votes of the persons present at such meeting and entitled to vote thereat, not to concur in the said union of the said churches, then and in such case the property, real and personal, belonging to or held in trust for or to the use of such non-concurring congregation shall be held by the existing trustees, or other trustees elected by the congregation, for the sole benefit of said congregation. Should such congregation decide in the manner aforesaid at any later time to enter the union and become part of the United Church, then this Act shall apply to the congregation and all the property thereof from the date of such decision.\nSec. 1. Chapter 122 of the Acts of 1924 is amended by the addition of the following subsection to Section 8:\n(d) 1. Any vote on the question of entering the said union taken in a congregation prior to the coming into force in pursuance of and in accordance with the provisions of the Act of incorporation, shall be deemed to be the vote of such congregation for the purposes of this Act.\nThe Nova Scotia courts as I have observed have had no doubt about the effectiveness of this legislation to empower St. Luke\u2019s Congregation by appropriate proceedings to enter the United Church. \u201cThe purposes of this Act\u201d mainly contemplated by the clause introduced into s. 8 of the Act of 1924 by the amendment of 19.25, are manifestly the \u201cpurposes\u201d of the first clause of the same section\u2014 clause (a)\u2014which specifically declares the consequences of a vote of non-concurrence. A vote of non-concurrence therefore pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of the Act of Incorporation is, in virtue of this amendment, a vote within the meaning of sec. 8 (a). It is, in short, in the words of the statute of 1925, a vote of non-concurrence for \u201cthe purposes of\u201d clause (a), and for all the purposes of that clause\u2014for the purposes of that part of the clause which enables a non-concurring congregation to enter the United Church, as well as of that part of it which declares the effects of non-concurrence.\nSt. Luke\u2019s Congregation is therefore a congregation within the operation of the second sentence of s. 8 (a):\nshould such congregation decide in manner aforesaid at any later time to enter the Union and become part of the United Church, then this Act shall apply to the congregation and all the property thereof from the date of such decision.\nSection 8 (a) and the statute of 1925 were not intended to take effect in vacuo. They must be read with the Act of Incorporation, which empowers the United Church to receive congregations after the Union. The capacities of the United Church, in so far as they affect the exercise of rights in relation to property or other civil rights within the province, are recognized by the provincial statute (s. 27). The enactments of that statute (as is evidenced by sec. 27) are intended to operate in harmony with the Act of Incorporation; and must be read in light of this legislation as a whole. Section (a), by necessary implication, empowers a non-concurring congregation to which it applies, to take, as a congregation, the steps prescribed, in order to \u201center the Union and become part of the United Church\u201d; and again, by necessary implication, to take these steps in co-operation with the United Church, acting under the powers derived from the Act of Incorporation and in pursuance of its provisions. It is, perhaps, not out of place to observe that, the main purpose of the enactment being clear, it ought not to be reduced to a nullity, in consequence of infelicities of draughtsmanship. Salmon v. Duncombe[2].\nAs to the property of the congregation, the Nova Scotia Statute is to apply to it. It matters little, it seems to me, whether that property comes under s. 4 or s. 6. If under s. 6, that section sanctions (as do s. 8. of the Act of Incorporation and article 8 of the Basis of Union) the use by a congregation of the United Church of congregational property in which, as property, the United Church has no interest and over which it has no control. The congregation, as a congregation of the United Church, has control over the congregational property (affected by s. 6) for congregational purposes; and after proper proceedings under s. 8 (a), the congregation is pursuing its legitimate congregational objects in exercising its ecclesiastical and religious functions as a congregation of the United Church. The trustees hold the property for the benefit of the congregation, that is to say, to enable the congregation to make use of it for such legitimate congregational purposes. In either view, the plaintiffs must fail if the proper steps have been taken under s. 8 (a). Turning now to the question of procedure. The enactment of the Act of Incorporation and the decision of the congregation to become a non-concurring congregation, necessarily affected the congregational procedure. The Book of Rules envisages a congregation under the Presbyterian polity; under a denominational system of church government in the Presbyterian form and in full vigour.\nBy section 8 (a), the property of a non-concurring congregation \u201cshall be held * * * for the sole benefit of the congregation.\u201d This necessarily implies capacity in the congregation to act as a congregation; and the last sentence of the clause, authorizing such a congregation \u201cto enter the Union\u201d if \u201csuch congregation decide, in the manner aforesaid\u201d to do so, implies the existence of capacity on the part of the congregation to reach a decision, \u201cin the manner aforesaid,\u201d that is to say, in the words of the earlier part of the clause, \u201cat a meeting of the congregation regularly called and held\u201d to \u201cdecide by a majority.\u201d\nA non-concurring congregation, so long as it remains unconnected with a denominational system acknowledging the Presbyterian form of government, is outside the sphere of Presbyteries and other superior church courts; and on the separation taking effect, all rules involving the exercise of authority by such superior courts were necessarily ipso facto suspended or modified in their practical operation. The retention of all such rules in their entirety may be put out of question, because that would have the effect, the obvious effect, in contingencies likely to occur in the ordinary course, contingencies which must have been foreseen, of paralysing the congregation as an ecclesiastical body. The participation of the Presbytery, for example, in the selection and induction of a minister became impossible; and the appointment of a minister, therefore, also impossible, unless plenary authority in relation to such matters vested in the congregation in consequence of the severance. So also, if the minister died or resigned or became incapable of acting, a session could not be properly constituted, according to the strict prescriptions of the Book of Rules; because according to the rules the appointment of an interim moderator rests exclusively with the Presbytery. There could, under the rules, be no properly constituted session and therefore, if the view advanced by the respondents be accepted, no properly constituted meeting of the congregation\u2014no such meeting \u201cregularly called and held.\u201d\nIt cannot be supposed that the legislature intended that the enactments of clause (a) should become nugatory in circumstances and conjunctures so probable that they must be taken to be contemplated; in such easily foreseeable contingencies, for example, as the resignation of the minister after a vote of non-concurrence. The Act of Incorporation for the Trustees of St. Luke\u2019s (C. 217 of Nova Scotia statutes of 1906) provides for an annual meeting of the congregation on a specified date, and prescribes the notice to be given. It enacts also that no property of the congregation shall be disposed of, and no action or suit brought by the trustees without the authority of the congregation, given at a regular meeting, called for the purpose of granting such authority. There is nothing in this Act requiring meetings of the congregation to be called by the session or requiring notice of the annual meeting, which the statute itself enjoins, to be given under the authority of the session.\nBut, assuming the proceedings directed and authorized by the St. Luke\u2019s Act to be governed by the rules in the Book of Rules, the Nova Scotia legislature, in enacting s. 8 (a) and in giving its sanction to the Dominion enactments in the Act of Incorporation, can hardly have intended to deprive a congregation situated as St. Luke\u2019s was, of the power of functioning as a congregation in relation to its property or in holding an annual meeting. A decision of such a congregation \u201cin the manner aforesaid\u201d which, by the second limb of s. 8 (a) is the condition upon the performance of which such a congregation enters the Union, does not require for its validity a meeting \u201cregularly called and held\u201d within the strict prescriptions of the Book of Rules\u2014a condition impossible of performance in such cases as those alluded to. What is required is a meeting fairly called in a manner conforming to the customary procedure in such a degree as is reasonably practicable, and, having regard to the disruption, fairly demanded in the circumstances of the particular case.\nI now turn to a brief consideration of the circumstances in which the impeached decision of the congregation was arrived at. First of all, it is well to correct an impression which one might gather from the judgments in the full court, that there was in fact no meeting of the elders who signed the notice calling the meeting of the congregation. There is evidence that the session, that is to say, the elders who were members of the session, in the absence, of course, of Mr. Johnston, decided to call a meeting of the congregation for the purpose of having a second vote. This evidence is uncontradicted and there was no cross-examination upon it. For the purposes of this appeal, it must be taken that the elders professed to meet, without Mr. Johnston, as a session, and that, as such, they decided upon calling the congregational meeting. In the circumstances, it would appear that the elders did everything that could reasonably be required of them. Mr. Johnston had, at a meeting of the Presbytery of Pictou on the 5th of May, been appointed interim moderator. On the 10th of June, the legislation constituting the United Church took effect and the vote of non-concurrence by St. Luke\u2019s Congregation in December became operative. Mr. Johnston, himself a non-concurrent, together with the Pictou Presbytery constituted by the non-concurring Presbyterian congregations, of which he was a member, assumed that St. Luke\u2019s came under the jurisdiction of this Presbytery\u2014a not unnatural supposition perhaps in view of the vote in the December preceding. In fact, St. Luke\u2019s had not adhered, and never did adhere to the church formed by the continuing Presbyterians, and the Presbytery never acquired any jurisdiction over that congregation. At a meeting of the session on the 10th of July, at which Mr. Johnston was present, there was a good deal of acrimonious discussion, and Mr. Johnston reported to the Presbytery that the elders had resigned; the Presbytery accordingly, acting no doubt under the belief that it possessed the authority to do so, appointed assessors, who with Mr. Johnston were to act as the Session (R. 59), In this action, the respondents took the position that these proceedings by the Presbytery were effective, that the elders had resigned as Mr. Johnston had reported, and that the assessors so appointed had been regularly constituted assessors, under the constitution by which the congregation was governed. The learned trial judge, the Chief Justice of Nova Scotia, held that, although Mr. Johnston had acted under a belief that the elders had resigned, there never was any intention on their part to do so, and that they had not in fact done so. The learned trial judge evidently accepted the evidence of the elders, and was convinced that there was a quarrel and a misunderstanding as to what had occurred. The learned judge also finds that Mr. Johnston was notoriously opposed to Union and opposed to the holding of a meeting for the purpose of taking a second vote.\nI cannot in these circumstances doubt that the elders, who unanimously desired a meeting of the congregation for that purpose, were entitled to proceed as they did. They and they alone represented the congregation as members of the Session. There was no minister. The presence of an interim moderator could not, for the reasons I have given, be essential to the proper constitution of a meeting of the Session.\nIt is argued that the present case differs from those suggested because there was an interim moderator who had been duly appointed; and it is contended that it was necessary to observe the rules in so far as it was possible to do so, in the circumstances. There are, I think, weighty reasons for doubting that Mr. Johnston\u2019s authority as interim moderator survived the separation of the congregation from the church which, by force of legislative enactment, had become incorporated in the United Church of Canada. Up to that time, he was interim moderator and possessed of such authority as pertained to that office under the constitution of the Presbyterian Church of Canada. But it was not an authority attaching to him personally in the sense that he was entitled to wield it according to his uncontrolled discretion. He was the appointee of the Presbytery; he was subject to the direction of the Presbytery as to calling meetings of the Session and in respect of other things; against him complaints could be addressed to the Presbytery, which had full powers to deal with such matters as well as a general superintendency over the Session. The records of the Session were subject to review by the Presbytery, to which an appeal lay from the Session. The Presbytery in its turn was subject to the jurisdiction of superior courts, the general assembly and the Synod. It would be superfluous to pursue these matters into their details. What is now contended is that Mr. Johnston, having been appointed interim moderator of this Session under a polity which conferred upon him certain very important powers touching matters pertaining to the spiritual and temporal affairs of the congregation, but subject, in the exercise of them, to the control and discipline of the superior courts of the church, still retained those powers in their full vigour, but free from any such discipline and control. I am disposed to think that the authority of the interim moderator lapsed when the disruption occurred which deprived the congregation of the protection provided in the Presbyterian polity against ill-judged or arbitrary acts by a moderator in whose appointment the congregation itself had no voice. That is the view upon which I am disposed to think this branch of the appeal ought to be decided; but, beyond that, I am wholly unable to assent to the proposition that an interim moderator in Mr. Johnston\u2019s position, assuming the attitude he assumed, asserting an authority derived from a Presbytery which had no jurisdiction over the congregation, could insist upon being recognized as the official solely entitled to initiate the proceedings necessary to call the congregation together for the transaction of business of vital moment to the congregation itself.\nIf the elders were strictly bound by the letter of the rules, they were in the circumstances powerless. By those rules it is the moderator who convenes the Session. It is true that he is bound to do so when enjoined by a superior court or when requested to do so by one-third of the elders. There was no longer a superior court possessed of jurisdiction. It is improbable that he would have recognized any of the elders (who, he believed, had resigned), if they had requested him to call a meeting. It is equally improbable that he would have called a meeting for such a purpose of his own motion. And if he had called one, there can be little doubt that he would have recognized only the assessors appointed by the Presbytery as entitled to take part with himself in the business of the Session. Under the rules, in their integrity, the elders would have had their remedy by way of complaint or appeal. In the circumstances, if the view advanced by the respondents be accepted, the elders of the congregation were subjected to the arbitrary dictates of the interim moderator. The appeal should be allowed with costs.\nNewcombe J. (concurred in by Rinfret J.).\u2014This action relates to a division which has unfortunately taken place in the congregation known to the law as \u201cSt. Luke\u2019s Presbyterian Congregation of Saltsprings in connection with Presbyterian Church in Canada,\u201d as to the position which that congregation occupies with regard to the recent legislative union of the churches. It is maintained by the plaintiffs, on the one hand, that the congregation is non-concurrent, while it is contended by the defendants, on the other hand, that the congregation belongs to the union.\nThe plaintiffs, whose contention has been upheld by the majority of the Supreme Court en banc, were, at the time of the union (10th June, 1925), members of the congregation in full communion, and the Rev. Robert Johnston, who was the pro tempore or interim Moderator of the Session. It is claimed, on behalf of the plaintiffs, that Mr. Cameron and Mr. Halliday were also assessors to the Session, and a question was suggested in the court below as to the validity of their appointment, but that is a question which, in my view, it will not be necessary to consider. The defendants are the trustees of the congregation under the statute of Nova Scotia, c. 217 of 1906, entitled An Act to Incorporate the Trustees of St. Luke\u2019s Presbyterian Congregation of Saltsprings in connection with the Presbyterian Church in Canada; also two reverend gentlemen, Mr. Frame and Mr. Matheson, who were in some wise thought to be concerned in the controversy, and against whom the action was dismissed.\nThe question depends upon the meaning of the legislation, to which I shall now refer, in its application to the material facts.\nThe Act incorporating the United Church of Canada, c. 100 of the Dominion, received assent on 19th July, 1924, and may be cited as The United Church of Canada Act; it recites that the Presbyterian Church in Canada, the Methodist Church and the Congregational Churches of Canada, believing the promotion of Christian unity to be in accordance with the Divine Will, recognize the obligation to seek and promote union with other churches adhering to the same fundamental principles of the Christian faith, and, having the right to unite with one another without loss of their identity, upon terms which they find to be consistent with such principles, have adopted a basis of union, which is set forth in schedule A. to the Act, and have agreed to unite and form one body or denomination of Christians under the name of \u201cThe United Church of Canada\u201d; and it is declared that the Act shall come into force on 10th June, 1925,\nexcept the provisions required to permit the vote provided for in section ten being taken, which section shall come into force on the tenth day of December, 1924.\nSome definitions follow, including these:\n(c) \u201cCongregation\u201d means any local church, charge, circuit, congregation, preaching station, or other local unit for purposes of worship in connection or in communion with any of the negotiating churches or of The United Church of Canada.\n(e) \u201cThe Presbyterian Church in Canada\u201d shall include * * * the Presbyterian congregations separately incorporated under any statute of the Dominion of Canada or of any province thereof, and all congregations heretofore and now connected or in communion with The Presbyterian Church in Canada, whether the same shall have been organized under the provisions of any statute or deed of trust or as union or as joint stock churches or otherwise howsoever.\n* * * * *\n(k) \u201cNon-concurring congregations\u201d shall mean those congregations which decide, as hereinafter provided, not to enter the union hereinafter mentioned.\nBy section 4, the union of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, the Methodist Church and the Congregational Churches becomes effective when the Act comes into force, namely, on 10th June, 1925,\nand the said churches, also united, are hereby constituted a body corporate and politic, under the name of \u201cThe United Church of Canada.\u201d\nThe several corporations, described as the Presbyterian Church in Canada, the Methodist Church and the Congregational Churches, are merged in the United Church, and the congregations of these churches which are known as the \u201cnegotiating churches,\u201d are admitted to, and declared to be congregations of, the United Church; but it is provided, notwithstanding anything in the Act contained, that members of any non-concurring congregation\nshall be deemed not to have become, by virtue of the said union or of this Act, members of the United Church;\nand provisions follow to the effect that any minister or member of the negotiating churches may, within six months from the coming into force of the Act, notify in writing to the prescribed authority his intention not to become a minister or member, as the case may be, of the United Church, and that, in such event, he shall be deemed not to have become, by virtue of the union or of the Act, such minister or member.\nSections 5 to 9 inclusive relate to church or congregational property, and need not, for the present, be considered. Section 10 is the important section. It provides in part that if any congregation in connection or communion with any of the negotiating churches, shall,\nat a meeting of the congregation regularly called and held at any time within six months before the coming into force of this Act (10th June, 1925) or within the time limited by any statute respecting the United Church of Canada passed by the legislature of the province in which the property of the congregation is situate, before such coming into force, decide by a majority of votes of the persons present at such meeting and entitled to vote thereat not to enter the said union of the said churches, then, and in such case, the property, real and personal, belonging to such non-concurring congregation shall remain unaffected by this Act, except that any church formed by non-concurring congregations of the respective negotiating churches into which such congregation enters shall stand in the place of the respective negotiating churches in respect of any trusts relating to such property, and except that, in respect of any such congregation which does not enter any church so formed, such property shall be held by the existing trustees or other trustees elected by the congregation free from any trust or reversion in favour of the respective negotiating churches and free from any control thereof or connection therewith.\nIt is further enacted by s. 10 that the persons entitled to vote shall be only those who are in full membership and whose names are on the roll of the church \u201cat the time of the passing of the Act\u201d (19th July, 1924); but it is nevertheless provided that\nIn any province where by an Act of the Legislature respecting the United Church of Canada passed prior to the passing of this Act, a different qualification for voting has been prescribed, the qualification for voting under this section shall be as provided in such Act.\nThen it is provided by paragraph (c) that\nThe non-concurring congregations in connection, or in communion with, any or all of the negotiating churches may use, to designate the said congregations, any names other than the names of the negotiating churches, as set forth in the preamble of this Act, and nothing in this Act contained shall prevent such congregations from constituting themselves a Presbyterian Church, a Methodist Church, or a Congregational Church, as the case may be, under the respective names so used.\nIt will have been observed by the foregoing that the meeting of the congregation at which the power of non-concurrence may be exercised is, by the express direction of the statute, to be regularly called and held. Paragraph (d) of s. 10 proceeds to define more closely the method by which the meeting may be called. It may be called by the authority of the Session of its own motion, and shall be called by the Session on requisition to that body in writing of a number of members entitled to vote, depending upon the total membership of the congregation; and it is further provided that such meeting shall be called by public notice read before the congregation at each diet of worship on two successive Lord\u2019s Days on which public service is held, and that such notice shall specify the object of the meeting.\nThese directions follow very nearly, although with variations, the method described by the Rules and Forms of Procedure of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, to be found in rule 19 thereof. That rule is as follows:\n19. Meetings of the congregation are called by the authority of the Session of its own motion or on requisition in writing of the Deacons\u2019 Court or Board of Managers, or of a number of persons in full communion, or by mandate of a superior court. Meetings are called by public notice, read before the congregation on the Lord\u2019s Day; such notice specifies the object of the meeting and is given on at least one Sabbath before the time of meeting, unless otherwise and specially provided for. Congregational meetings are opened and closed with prayer.\nBefore passing on to consider the provincial legislation, attention should, perhaps, be directed to s. 22 of the Dominion Act, by which it is provided that all synods and presbyteries of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, and all other courts or governing bodies of any of the negotiating churches shall,\nsave as to the non-concurring congregations, continue to have, exercise and enjoy all or any of their respective powers, rights, authorities and privileges, in the same manner and to the same extent as if this Act had not been passed, until such time or times as the United Church, by its general council, shall declare that the said powers, rights, authorities and privileges, or any of them, shall cease and determine.\nThere is no evidence of any such declaration, and I refer to this section because the appellants endeavour to justify an inference from it that, once a congregation becomes non-concurring, it ceases to be subject to any of the church courts or governing bodies. The section, however, did not come into effect until 10th June, 1925, when the non-concurrence became operative, and then it did not, in my view, operate to displace the regulations for the holding of meetings contemplated by the previous clauses to which I have referred, and which, I think, must have their application, notwithstanding any inference which may be admissible under s. 22. The promoters of the union, in order to obtain adequate legislative sanction, and for the avoidance of doubts, sought legislation, not only by the Dominion, but also by the provinces, and, in Nova Scotia, the local provisions are to be found in ch. 122 of 1924, entitled An Act Respecting the Union of Certain Churches Therein Named, enacted on 9th May, as amended by c. 167, enacted on 7th May of the next following year. We were told that the common intent was, in one way or another, to have each legislative provision sanctioned by both the Parliament and the provincial legislature, and no question of legislative power was in terms raised or suggested at the hearing, although the point is specifically made in the statement of claim that the proceedings upon which the defendants rely are \u201cnull and void and of no effect.\u201d So far as the intention of Parliament and of the legislature appear to be the same, it is, perhaps, unnecessary to define their respective limits of authority, but, as I shall presently shew, the Assembly has, in some material particulars, purported to enact provisions which form no part of the incorporating Act. The local statute is however largely in conformity with and anticipates the enactments of the United Church of Canada Act. It is provided by s. 29, the concluding section, that\nThis Act shall come into force on the date upon which the United. Church shall be incorporated by Act of Parliament of Canada, provided that the said date, in respect of the whole of this Act or any section or sections thereof, may be altered to such date or dates as shall be fixed by proclamation of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, to be made upon the request in writing of the said Committee on Law and Legislation and the joint committee of Church Union to be evidenced by the hand of its chairman and secretary.\nOur attention was not directed to any such proclamation, and none appears to have been published in the Nova Scotia Gazette. The local provisions affecting non-concurrence are to be found in s. 8 of the Nova Scotia Act, and they correspond, in some measure, with s. 10 of the Dominion Act, but it will be useful, I think, to reproduce s. 8. It reads as follows:\n8. (a) Provided always, that if any congregation in connection or communion with any of the negotiating churches shall, at a meeting of the congregation regularly called and held within six months after the coming into force of this section, decide by a majority of votes of the persons present at such meeting and entitled to vote thereat, not to concur in the said union of the said churches, then and in such case the property, real and personal, belonging to or held in trust for or to the use of such non-concurring congregation shall be held by the existing trustees, or other trustees elected by the congregation, for the sole benefit of said congregation. Should such congregation decide in the manner aforesaid at any later time to enter the union and become part of the United Church, then this Act shall apply to the congregation and all the property thereof from the date of such decision.\n(aa) notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (a) no congregation of the negotiating churches within the province of Nova Scotia excepting such congregation as have prior to the passing of this Act joined with any one or more congregations of any of the other negotiating churches for purposes of worship shall be deemed to have entered the Union or become part of the United Church, nor shall all the property, real or personal, belonging to or held in trust for or to the use of such congregation be affected by the provisions of this Act, if within six months from the day upon which this Act comes into force such congregation at a meeting of the congregation regularly called shall decide by a majority of votes of the persons present at such meeting and entitled to vote thereat not to concur in the said Union of said churches.\n(b) the persons entitled to vote under the provisions of the first clause of this section shall be those who by the constitution of the congregation, if so provided, or by the practice of the Church with which they are connected, are entitled to vote at a meeting of the congregation.\n(c) \u201cCongregation\u201d in this section means a local church as mentioned in the Basis of Union.\nParagraph (b) of this section should be read in connection with rule 14 of the Rules and Forms of Procedure of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, by which it is prescribed that\nAll members in full communion, male and female, have the right to vote at all congregational meetings, arid to them exclusively belongs the right of choosing ministers, elders and deacons. At any meeting of the congregation when matters relating to the temporal affairs of the congregation, and not affecting the order of worship, the discipline of the Church, or the disposal of property, are under consideration, adherents who contribute regularly for the support of the Church and its ordinances may vote.\nIt will have been perceived that the Nova Scotia Act came into force as a whole on 10th June, 1925, and there is no such exception, as there is in s. 2 of the Dominion Act, with respect to the\nprovisions required to permit the vote provided for in section ten being taken,\nand that, by the provincial requirement, the time for a meeting of the congregation to authorize non-concurrence in the union is within six months after the coming into force of s. 8; and, moreover, there is introduced into s. 8 the concluding sentence of paragraph (a), which provides that\nShould such congregation decide in the manner aforesaid at any later time to enter the Union and become part, of the United Church, then this Act shall apply to the congregation and all the property thereof from the date of such decision. There is no corresponding enactment in the Dominion Act, nor does that Act contain any express provision whereby a non-concurring congregation may enter the union; and,-moreover, according to the meaning of s. 8 (a), the intention seems to be that this concluding sentence applies only, to a congregation which, at a meeting within six months after 10th June, 1925, has decided, by a majority of votes, not to concur in the union. What happened may now be\u2019 stated in the order of the events.\nOn 22nd December, 1924, the congregation of Saltsprings, then under the ministry of the Rev. S. C. Walls, voted not to concur in the union. There is, notwithstanding a suggestion to the contrary by the learned Chief Justice who tried the cause, no dispute as to the regularity and effect of this meeting. The vote was for non-concurrence, and the congregation admittedly then became non-concurrent. The minister, who was in the minority, resigned. The congregation was within the bounds of the Presbytery of Pictou, and that body, following the prescribed practice in like cases, at a meeting on 5th May, 1925, appointed a pro tempore Moderator of the Session. The Rev. Robert Johnston was selected, and, by the minute, his appointment was to take effect from 10th May. His powers and duties as Moderator are regulated by Rules 53, 54, 58 and 59 of the Forms and Rules of Procedure, as follows:\n53. The duty of the moderator is to preside; to preserve order; to take the vote; to announce the decisions of the court and to pronounce censures. The moderator may introduce any competent business, and may express his views upon any matter under consideration. He has only a casting vote.\n54. In the absence of the moderator, or when, for prudential reasons, he deems it better not to preside, another minister of the Church, having authority from him, may act as moderator pro tempore. When the minister has been removed by death or otherwise, or is under suspension, a moderator pro tempore is appointed by the Presbytery.\n58. The moderator has power to convene the Session when he sees fit; and he is bound to do so when enjoined by a superior court or requested by one-third of the elders. Meetings are called on the authority of the moderator, either by notice from the pulpit or by personal notice to the members.\n59. The moderator and two other members constitute a quorum. When from any cause, the number of elders is not sufficient to form a quorum, application is made to the Presbytery for assessors to act with the other members until new elders have been elected.\nAt the December meeting, there had been a substantial minority of the congregation voting against non-concurrence, and subsequently a question of reconsideration arose. There were, nominally, nine elders. On 10th July, Mr. Johnston met the Session, when he ascertained that three of the five elders who attended were unwilling to continue in office. There was talk about resignations, and the minister apparently understood that the way was open for the election or re-election of seven elders. Notice was to be given on the two next following Sabbaths, 12th and 19th July, and the ballots were to be taken oh the third Sabbath, 26th July. Whether or not this was done does not appear by the evidence, but I infer that the election did not take place. Some of the elders caused to be read at the church on 19th and 26th July the following notice:\nNotice is hereby given that a meeting of the congregation shall be held at the Church on the 27th day of July, 1925, at 2 o\u2019clock p.m. for the purpose of considering and voting upon a resolution that St. Luke\u2019s Presbyterian Church, Saltsprings, concur in the Union of the Churches provided for by Chapter 122 of the Acts of Nova Scotia for 1924, and that the said St. Luke\u2019s Presbyterian Church at Saltsprings shall become part of The United Church of Canada. The meeting and the voting thereat shall take place under the provisions of said section 8 of said Chapter 122 of the Acts of Nova Scotia, 1924.\nDated at Saltsprings, N.S., this 18th day of July, 1925.\nThis notice was preceded by a requisition, signed by some of the members of the congregation, which reads as follows:\nThe undersigned members in full communion of St. Luke\u2019s Presbyterian Congregation at Saltsprings hereby request the elders to call a meeting of the congregation to be held at the earliest time possible under the constitution of the Church for the purpose of considering and voting whether or not the said cogregation shall concur in the union of St. Luke\u2019s Church with The United Church of Canada, and become part of the said The United Church of Canada.\nThe said meeting is to be called under Section 8 of Chapter 122, of the statutes of Nova Scotia, for the year 1924.\nDated at Saltsprings, N.S., this 15th day of July, 1925.\nThe pulpit was supplied, on 19th July, by Mr. Harrison, a student for the ministry, who had for some time been conducting services for the congregation under authority of the Presbytery; and, on the 26th, Mr. Johnston preached, but each of them declined to read the notice.\nPursuant to the notice thus advertised, a meeting was held at the time and place thereby appointed, when, according to the notes of the meeting, Mr. W. H. McKay, one of the elders, was appointed Chairman of the meeting, and Mr. C. H. McKay, Secretary. The notice was read, and the following resolution, moved and seconded by two of the elders, was put to the meeting and carried by a standing vote:\nResolved, that St. Luke\u2019s Presbyterian Church, Saltsprings, concur in the Union of Churches, provided for by Chapter 122 of the Acts of Nova Scotia for 1924, and that St. Luke\u2019s Presbyterian Church, Saltsprings, shall become part of the United Church of Canada.\nThe votes having been counted by scrutineers, who were then appointed, the Chairman declared 100 for, and none opposing, and he then proceeded to declare.\nThat St. Luke\u2019s Presbyterian Church, Saltsprings, is now a part of the United Church of Canada.\nThen a letter was prepared by the Rev. Mr. Farquhar, \u201cthe minister in New Glasgow,\u201d who had been invited to attend the meeting, and signed by Mr. A. C. MacDonald, the clerk of the Session. The letter is addressed to Mr. Harrison, the student who had been supplying the congregation at Saltsprings, and reads as follows:\nSt. Luke\u2019s Church, Saltsprings\nJuly 27, 1925.\nMr. E. Harrison,\nSaltsprings.\nDear Sir,\u2014You will recall that some time ago a resolution was passed and communicated to you that we held ourselves responsible for your services for two Sundays only, your services to terminate on June 10. You have since continued to give services in the congregation of St. Luke\u2019s while it remained an independent congregation and neither at the request of nor with the acquiescence of the elders of the congregation, in whose hands all arrangements for pulpit supply, for the time being, lay.\nTo avoid difficulty we have till now taken no action. To-day the congregation of St. Luke\u2019s has decided to enter the United Church of Canada.\nThis is to inform you that from to-day any further attempt on your part to supply St. Luke\u2019s will be in opposition to the wishes of the elders and the congregation and contravene the authority of the Presbytery of Pictou of the United Church of Canada, under whose jurisdiction this congregation now lies.\nWe write you thus because we are persuaded that you are not aware of the gravity of the situation, and the very serious matter of contravening constituted authority.\nWe would also inform you that the Presbytery of Pictou of the United Church of Canada is asked to send supply to the pulpit of St. Luke\u2019s on Sunday next.\nYours very truly,\n(Sgd.) Alex. C. McDonald,\nSession Clerk.\nThe writ was issued on 1st September, 1925.\nThe trial was had before the learned Chief Justice. He had some doubts as to the validity of the meeting of December 24, 1924, when the congregation voted non-concurrence. He concluded that the elders had not resigned. He thought that if the pro tempore moderator had not been properly appointed, he would not be a constituent of the Session, and that the signing of the notice for the congregational meeting of 27th July \u201cwould seem to do away with the necessity of any meeting\u201d of the Session; but, upon the assumption that Mr. Johnston had been properly appointed, he expressed the following view:\nThe situation was, as everybody knew, that the Reverend Robert Johnston would oppose in every way the taking of a second vote on the question of Union by this congregation. His attitude throughout shews this. If a meeting of the Session had been asked for there is no reason to suppose that he would have called it; and if he had called it he would have had no vote at the Session meeting, because all the elders were unanimously for the holding of a meeting, and the minister only had a casting vote in case of an equal division. Under the circumstances the holding of a meeting of the Session would have been a mere formality and the question is whether the notice given by all the elders was not under the circumstances a good notice for the purpose. I think it was.\nHe held that the notice of the congregational meeting complied with the rules; that s. 7 of ch. 217 has reference only to the Annual Meeting of the congregation, and does not apply to the meeting of 27th July, and he held that, although it had been argued that there was no provision for a second vote upon the question of union, and that once the congregation had voted against union, no further vote was permissible, the latter part of s. 8 (a) of the provincial Act specifically states that after the congregation has decided not to concur, it may, at a later date, decide to enter the union. Accordingly, he dismissed the action.\nThe plaintiffs appealed, and the judges en banc were Rogers, Mellish, Graham and Carroll JJ. The majority (Rogers, Graham and Carroll JJ.) were of the view that the congregational meeting of 27th July, 1925, was ineffective because no meeting of the Session was held authorizing the calling of the congregational meeting, and that, in the absence of such authorization, a valid meeting could not be held, seeing that, by the requirements of s. 8 (a) of the provincial Act, non-concurrence of a congregation could not be authorized, unless \u201cat a meeting of the congregation regularly called and held.\u201d The learned judges referred to the Rules and Forms of Procedure, adopted by the General Assembly, as setting forth the law and practice of the Church, and they considered that the regularity of the procedure was to be judged by these rules, and that, if the elders believed that the congregation had changed its view, and desired to enter the union, their proper course would have been to request another meeting of the Session, under Rule 38, for the purpose of passing a resolution for the calling of another meeting. Mellish J., on the other hand, was of the opinion that it was the paramount intention and purpose of Parliament and the Legislature \u201cto obliterate each of the negotiating churches as such, and their ministry and membership,\u201d and he says that after the union, the Session of the Saltsprings congregation had no right to function, that it no longer remained a court of a negotiating church, and that the elders and congregation were no longer under any obligation to respect or conform to the previously existing rules with respect to meetings. Mellish J., seems therefore to have been of the opinion, if I do not misjudge his reasoning, that the July meeting was regularly called and held within the meaning of s. 8 (a) of the provincial Act.\nBeyond this, he held that the trustees of the Saltsprings congregation are not entitled to hold the congregational property in trust for the benefit of the congregation as part of the United Church, unless the congregation consent thereto; that the individual members of the congregation have the right to select their own church, but not to alter the proprietary rights of each other, unless so authorized by statute, and that\nthe consent contemplated is not the consent of the congregation as a part of the United Church, but in this case I think the quondam congregation of the Presbyterian Church in Canada known as St. Luke\u2019s. And their property can, I think, be dealt with under the Act incorporating the trustees to reasonably meet any situation, whether the congregation enters the union in a body or not.\nThis point, it is said, was not raised before the learned Chief Justice at the trial, and it is rejected by Rogers and Graham JJ., who are in agreement throughout, although Carroll J., concurs with Mellish J.\nas to the conditions or terms under which this particular property is held.\nIn the result, upon the latter point, the Court en banc is equally divided, but in the view which I take of the case, it is not necessary for me to consider it.\nOne must desiderate, in these judgments, an explanation or statement of the reasons which led the judges in Nova Scotia to permit the provincial Act to operate in a manner to affect the constitution of the United Church as incorporated and established by Act of Parliament. It is remarkable that no attention was paid to that subject, but it is none the less obvious that, by the United Church of Canada Act, every congregation of the Presbyterian Church in Canada was a negotiating church, and, subject to the provisions or exceptions of s. 10 of that Act, became embodied in the union, on 10th June, 1925, when the union of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, the Methodist Church and the Congregational Churches, became operative, and the churches, as so united, were constituted, a body corporate and politic under the name of The United Church of Canada. The legislative description is that the several corporations embraced within the definitions of s. 3 are merged in the United Church, and the congregations are admitted, and declared to be, congregations of the United Church; and, moreover, the congregations which, in the manner and within the time prescribed, decided not to enter the union, were excepted from the union as non-concurrent. These remain, as to their property, unaffected by the Act of Union, except in respect of trusts and reversions, as to which there are special provisions, intended no doubt, for the protection of the non-concurring congregations, and to produce equity.\nNow the time for non-concurrence was within six months before 10th June, 1925, \u201cor within the time limited by any statute respecting the United Church of Canada passed by the legislature of the province in which the property of the congregation is situate, before such coming into force,\u201d and the meeting of non-concurrence was held on 22nd December, 1924, before the provincial Act, or any of its provisions, came into force, and not otherwise than under the Church Union Act of Canada. This proceeding seems definitely to have placed Saltsprings in the category of a non-concurring congregation. Certainly the Nova Scotia Act, including s. 8, was passed before the Dominion Act, if that be a relevant circumstance, but neither s. 8, nor any other provision of the local Act, was meant to come into force until 10th June, 1925, nor had it anything to do with bringing about the condition of non-concurrence in which Saltsprings has stood since the meeting of 22nd December, 1924, by the effect of the Dominion Act; and, the power of non-concurrence which the congregation duly exercised under that Act, having been invoked with affirmative consequences, is, in my opinion, exhausted, and cannot be reviewed by the congregation. Under the authority of the Dominion Act there is no sanction for re-trial of the vote upon a future occasion; and by the amending Act of Nova Scotia, ch. 167 of 1925, it is enacted in terms that\n1. Any vote on the question of entering the said union taken in a congregation prior to the coming into force in pursuance of and in accordance with the provisions of the Act of incorporation, shall be deemed to be the vote of such congregation for the purposes of this Act.\n2. Notwithstanding any informality in the taking of any vote or defect in the proceedings relating thereto, and notwithstanding that persons not entitled to vote have voted or that persons entitled to vote have been deprived of the vote, all votes taken or purporting to have been taken in pursuance of the Act of incorporation shall be valid and binding upon the congregations respectively in which such votes have been taken unless on or before the 10th day of June, 1925, a proceeding is taken in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia for the purpose of having such vote set aside or declared of no effect.\nThe concluding sentence of s. 8 (a) of the provincial Act does not help; first, because the premises or conditions in which it is intended to operate never did, in fact, exist; and secondly, because that clause, relying, as it does, solely upon provincial authority, is incompetent to the legislature of the province, according to principles which are very plainly established by such cases as Dobie v. The Temporalities Board[3]; Colonial Building and Investment Association v. Attorney General of Quebec[4], and the more recent authorities.\nMoreover, the formula of the vote, by which a congregation of the negotiating churches may escape union, as prescribed by the Dominion Act and by s. 8 (a) of the Nova Scotia Act, differs from that which has been adopted in this case under the authority said to be derived from s. 8 (a). What is required, in order to disqualify and exclude a congregation from the operation of the Act of Union, is a majority of qualified votes \u201cnot to enter such union of the said churches,\u201d and in fact the vote of 22nd December, 1924, is the only vote which complies with that requirement. No effect is given by Parliament to a resolution, expressing concurrence in the union of the churches, or that a congregation \u201cshall become part of the United Church of Canada,\u201d nor is any authority given for the holding of a meeting for such a purpose.\nAs to the invalidity of the meeting of 27th.July, I agree with the reasons of the majority of the Supreme Court en banc. A meeting of non-concurrence is held under the authority of the United Church of Canada Act, and should, as I interpret the statute, be held before the union comes into force. It is, for the purposes of this case, a meeting of a congregation of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, and I should have thought that, in the absence of any express statutory provision, the regulations of that church applicable to holding a congregational meeting in like circumstances were apt to regulate the meeting for which the statute provides.\nNow I have already shewn that Rule 19 requires that meetings of the congregation shall be called by the authority of the Session, which may act of its own motion or on requisition in writing of the Deacons\u2019 Court or Board of Managers, or of a number of persons in full communion, or by mandate of a superior court, and rule 50 reiterates that it is the duty of the Session \u201cto call congregational meetings.\u201d These rules were not followed as to the meeting of 27th July, and there was no antecedent meeting of the Session, but, moreover, by s. 10 (d), the statute itself specially provides that a meeting of the congregation for the purposes of expressing non-concurrence may be called by authority of the Session of its own motion, and shall be called by the Session on requisition to it in writing of twenty-five members entitled to vote, in congregations, such as this, having over 100, and not more than 500 members. There was no compliance with these provisions, and in consequence it seems to me to be very plain that the meeting of 27th July was not regularly called or held, and that consequently, if for no other reason, it failed of its purpose. I do not think the Court is entitled to infer that, although the regulations were disregarded, the meeting, such as it was, would have been held, or would have reached the identical result, if the prescribed preliminaries had been observed, and it is, I should think, very unlikely that Parliament or the legislature intended to leave congregations who were in doubt about their future affiliation, without adequate directions for the determination of that vital question. The suggestion that the defect in the meeting of 27th July is, at most, an irregularity, which does not affect the reality of the thing accomplished, ought therefore to be rejected. The prescribed regulations must, I should think, rather be regarded as essential requirements of procedure in the polity or administration of the Church. And besides, there is a two-fold answer: In the first place, the statute in this particular case, which involves the whole status of the congregation, expressly insists that the meeting shall be regularly called and held, and therefore it would seem that irregularity is not to be tolerated; and, secondly even assuming regularity in the calling of the meeting, its object and business, in so far as it could effectively serve any purpose, was, in substance, the reversal of a statutory election or option, which having been already competently exercised, could not be revoked by the congregation: quod semel placuit in electionibus amplius displicere non potest. The case is not within the principle enunciated in the cases of which the well known judgment of Mellish L.J., in McDougall v. Gardiner[5], is a leading example.\nFor these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal, but I think the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc should be varied by striking out the fourth paragraph, which begins with a statement of opinion\nthat the congregation, at a meeting regularly called and held, may, pursuant to the latter part of s. 8 (a), of ch. 122 of the Acts of the Province of Nova Scotia, 1924, enter the union and become part of the United Church,\nbecause I am not satisfied that this congregation may, pursuant to that authority, exercise such a power, and certainly cannot do so in the present circumstances with the consequence of uniting or merging the congregation with the united body.\nThe costs of the appeal should follow the event.\nSmith J.\u2014I agree with the Chief Justice and my brother Newcombe that the provincial Act could not introduce into the Dominion Corporation a congregation that the latter Act, in pursuance of the vote of non-concurrence under it, expressly excluded. This ground, however, was not taken, either in the court below or here, and my brother Newcombe has therefore deemed it advisable to discuss the merits of the appeal upon the grounds presented to the Court.\nIf this be advisable, I would concur in his conclusions, as I agree with him that the meeting of 27th July, 1925, was not strictly regular. It seems to me that the rules of procedure of the Presbyterian Church in Canada continued to apply to this congregation after the union, so far as applicable, and that the officers of the congregation continued in office. I think there was a method by which a meeting of the Session could have been had, in accordance with these rules, notwithstanding any efforts by the temporary moderator to prevent it.\nThe object of the meeting was to enable the members of the congregation who wished to go into the union to carry with them into the union the property of the congregation. If that could be done at all, under authority of the provincial statute, it could only be done by the vote of a meeting regularly called. It is argued that what was done by the individual members of the Session in calling a meeting is precisely what would have been done had a meeting of the Session been regularly called, and that therefore there is no substantial difference, and that the contention that the meeting was not regularas a mere technicality, without substantial merit. There is, of course, weight in this argument, and it was pressed with great force. The answer to it would be that if the statute authorizes the transfer of the property of the congregation from the congregation to another body, upon a vote taken at a meeting regularly called, this condition must be strictly fulfilled, and here it was not fulfilled, because the meeting was not regular. The point is, of course, a debatable one, as is indicated by the difference that has arisen in judicial opinion concerning it in this case. I have, however, intimated that in my opinion, for the reasons set out by the Chief Justice and also by my brother Newcombe, the vote of 27th July, 1925, even if the meeting had been regular, was ineffective to carry either the congregation or its property into the union.\nI concur in disposing of the appeal as proposed by my brother Newcombe.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: L.

V, c. 78), s. 95 (3) (as enacted by 7 Geo. V, c. 45, s. 9)\u2014Consolidated Municipal Act, 1922, c. 72, ss. 249 (1), 297 (1).\nPlaintiff removed from the city of Toronto to the township of York on December 14, 1923. He paid an income tax to the City of Toronto in 1923 and to the Township of York in 1924. An assessment roll for the City of Toronto was prepared and settled in 1923, pursuant to by-law under s. 57 of the Assessment Act, R.S.O. 1914, c. 195, and plaintiff, then resident in Toronto, was entered on this roll for income. This assessment of 1923 was, pursuant to subs. 5 of said s. 57, adopted by the city council of 1924, by by-law passed February 28, 1924, and the City levied on plaintiff an income tax in 1924, which he paid under protest. He now sought repayment.\nHeld (reversing judgment of the Appellate Division, Ont., 63 Ont. L.R. 397, which, by equal division, sustained the judgment of Widdifield, Co. C.J., dismissing the action), that plaintiff should succeed. The income assessed in 1924 was the income for 1924 (City of Ottawa v. Egan [1923] S.C.R. 304) notwithstanding 12-13 Geo. V, c. 78, s. 11, changing subs. 2 of s. 11 of said Assesment Act. That subsection, as so changed, merely made the amount of the previous year\u2019s income conclusive as to the amount of income to be assessed in the current year, instead of (as formerly) a mere basis for estimating the amount for the current year. The income to be assessed was still the income for the current year. Therefore, under its by-law of February 28, 1924, the city council was assessing and levying on plaintiff\u2019s income of 1924; and in doing so was attempting to exercise jurisdiction outside the municipality, contrary to s. 249 of the Consolidated Municipal Act, 1922, was going beyond the jurisdiction given it by s. 297 of said Act to \u201clevy on the whole rateable property within the municipality,\u201d and was attempting to assess plaintiff in respect of income in a municipality in which he did not reside, contrary to s. 12 of said Assessment Act. Subs. 3 of s. 95 of said Assessment Act, as enacted by 7 Geo. V, c. 45, s. 9, did not give power to the City to collect from plaintiff a tax on his income of 1924; that subsection only applies to rates properly assessable, and not to rates levied on an income not assessable at all. The fact that the assessment roll of 1923 was finally revised and settled without an appeal by plaintiff, then resident in Toronto, did not make the matter res judicata (Hagersville v. Hambleton, 61 Ont. L.R. 327, distinguished). APPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1] dismissing (on equal division of the court) his appeal from the judgment of Widdifield, Co. C.J., dismissing his action for return of money paid, under protest, to the defendant, the City of Toronto, for income tax.\nThe material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was allowed with costs.\nThe appellant in person (with him John C.M. Macbeth) for the appellant.\nG.R. Geary K.C and F.A.A. Campbell for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nSMITH J.\u2014The appellant for some time had been a resident of the City of Toronto, but, on the 14th December, 1923, he removed to the Township of York, where he has since continuously resided. He paid an income tax to the City of Toronto in 1923, and to the Township of York in 1924. The City of Toronto assessed and levied on him an income tax in 1924 of $176.46, which he paid under protest on the 9th day of March, 1925, and which he seeks to recover with interest in this action.\nThe trial judge dismissed the action, and this judgment was sustained by the First Appellate Division1, the Court of four being equally divided.\nSection 249 of the Consolidated Municipal Act, 1922 (now s. 258) is as follows:\n249 (1) Except where otherwise provided, the jurisdiction of every council shall be confined to the municipality which it represents and its powers shall be exercised by by\u2011law.\nSection 297 (1), now s. 306 (1), provides that,\nSubject to subsection 13 of section 397 (not material here), the council of every municipality shall in each year assess and levy on the whole rateable property within the municipality a sum sufficient to pay all debts of the corporation, whether of principal or interest, falling due within the year.\nSection 300 (now s. 309) provides that,\nThe rates imposed for any year shall be deemed to have been imposed and to be due on and from the 1st day of January of each year unless otherwise expressly provided by the by-law by which they are imposed. Sections 11 and 12 of R.S.O. 1914, c. 195, provide as follows:\n11. (1) Subject to the exemptions provided for in sections 5 and 10 (not material here)\u2014\n(a) Every person not liable to business assessment under section 10 shall be assessed in respect of income;\n((b) and (c) not material here.)\n(2) Where such income is not a salary or other fixed amount capable of being estimated for the current year, the income of such person for the purposes of assessment shall be taken to be not less than the amount of his income during the year ending on the 31st December then last past.\n12. (1) Subject to subsection 6 of section 40 (not material here), every person assessable in respect of income under section 11 shall be so assessable in the municipality in which he resides either at his place of residence or at his office or place of business.\nSection 50 of the Assessment Act, R.S.O. 1914, c. 195, provides that, subject to ss. 56 to 60, the Assessor shall begin to make his roll in each year not later than the 15th day of February, and complete it not later than the 30th day of April.\nSection 57 provides that the council of a city may, by by-law, provide for making the assessment at any time prior to the 30th September, and may fix prior and separate dates for the return of the roll of each ward, and shall provide for holding a Court of Revision.\nSubsections 3 and 4 provide that the County Judge may sit throughout the year to hear appeals as therein provided.\nSubsection 5 provides that,\nThe assessment so made and completed may be adopted by the council of the following year as the assessment on which the rate of taxation for such following year shall be fixed and levied, and the taxes for such following year shall in such case be fixed and levied upon the said assessment.\n7 Geo. V, c. 45, s. 9, amended s. 95 of the Assessment Act by adding subs. (3) as follows:\n(3) Subject to the provisions of section 118 (now 121) every person assessed in respect of business or income upon any assessment roll which has been revised by the Court of Revision or County Judge shall be liable for any rates which may be levied upon such assessment roll notwithstanding the death or the removal from the municipality of the person assessed or that the assessment roll had not been adopted by the council of the municipality until the following year.\nAn assessment roll for the City of Toronto was prepared and settled in 1923, pursuant to by\u2011law under s. 57, and the appellant was entered on this roll for income quite properly, as he was a resident of Toronto in that year and in receipt of the income mentioned in the roll. He made no appeal, and had no ground for appeal. This assessment of 1923 was, pursuant to subs. (5) of s. 57 quoted above, adopted by the council of the following year by by-law No. 9942, passed 28th February, 1924, and by this same by-law the council exercised the power given it by s. 297 of the Municipal Act, and nowhere else, to \u201cassess and levy on the whole rateable property within the municipality the sum required for the current year.\u201d\nThe effect of subs. (2) of s. 11 of the Assessment Act as quoted above was considered in City of Ottawa v. Egan[2]. The City of Ottawa assessed and levied in 1921 an income tax on Sir Henry K. Egan in respect of moneys received from an industrial company in 1920. It was established that no similar amount was received from the company in 1921. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario held that this amount must be deducted from the income assessment, and this was affirmed by the unanimous judgment of this Court.\nThe decision was that the income to be taxed was the income for the current year, and that the income of the preceding year was only a basis from which to estimate the former. Duff J. says, at p. 309:\nThe principle of income assessment and taxation clearly expressed in the legislation which comes under consideration on this appeal is that it is the income for the current year which is assessable.\nWe must accept this as still the law, unless it has been changed by subsequent legislation.\nSubsection (2) of section 11, quoted above, was repealed by 12-13 Geo. V., c. 78, s. 11, and the following substituted:\n(2) The income to be assessed shall be the amount of the income received during the year ending on the 31st of December then last past.\nThis provision has remained unchanged, and is now subs. (2) of s. 10 of the Act. No other statutory change material here seems to have been made.\nHas, then, this change in subs. (2) entirely altered the principle of income assessment expressed in the legislation prior to this change as laid down in City of Ottawa v. Egan[3], and has it had the effect of enacting that, in case of a city proceeding under s. 57 (5), the income to be assessed shall be not the income for the current year, but the income for the previous year? I am of opinion that the substituted subsection (2) has no such effect. It merely makes the amount of the previous year\u2019s income conclusive as to the amount of income to be assessed in the current year, instead of a mere basis for estimating the amount for the current year. The income to be assessed is still the income for the current year, to be fixed at the amount of the previous year\u2019s income, and not subject to be changed to the actual amount of the current year\u2019s income, as previously.\nIt follows, therefore, that the decision in City of Ottawa v. Egan3 applies in this case, and that the assessment in question was on appellant\u2019s income of 1924, during which year he was a resident of another municipality, and was properly assessed there for that income. The city council, therefore, in assessing and levying by its by-law of 28th February, 1924, on appellant\u2019s income of 1924, was attempting to exercise jurisdiction outside the municipality that it represented, contrary to s. 249 of the Municipal Act; was going beyond the jurisdiction given it by s. 297 to \u201clevy on the whole rateable property within the municipality\u201d; was attempting to assess the appellant in respect of income in a municipality in which he did not reside, contrary to s. 12 of the Assessment Act; and was thus attempting to subject the appellant to taxation twice on his income of 1924.\nIt is contended, however, that, notwithstanding these sections, the added subs. (3) of the statute of 1917, quoted above, gives the city council power to collect from the appellant a tax on his income of 1924.\nI agree with the view expressed by Hodgins, J.A., in the Appellate Division that this subsection only applies to rates properly assessable, and cannot apply to rates levied on an income not assessable at all, as in this case.\nIt is further argued that, because the assessment roll of 1923 was finally revised and settled without an appeal by the appellant, then resident in Toronto, the matter is res judicata, and the case of Hagersville v. Hambleton[4], is relied on. There the defendant was assessed for income and appealed to the Court of Revision on the ground that he was not a resident; his appeal was dismissed and he made no further appeal. In an action by the corporation for these taxes, defendant pleaded that there was no right to tax, because he was not a resident, and the decision was that, as the Court of Revision, being a court of competent jurisdiction, had decided that point, that decision was final.\nI am quite unable to see that this decision has any application to the present case. We have in question here the assessment of appellant\u2019s income of 1924. The assessment roll of 1923 had to do with the income of 1923, and the Court of Revision for that year had no jurisdiction to deal with the income of 1924. Appellant was properly placed on the 1923 roll for the income appearing there. He could not appeal successfully against being placed there for that income, and he clearly could not have appealed then against being assessed for the same amount for income in 1924, by by-law of that year. The assessment and levy on his income for 1924 were first made by by-law of 28th February, 1924, and there was no tribunal to which he could appeal against that improper assessment and levy except the ordinary courts to which he has resorted.\nThe only passage in the judgments in Hagersville v. Hambleton4 that seems to me to have any application to this case is the quotation by Riddell J. from Board v. Board[5], as follows:\nIf the right exists, the presumption is that there is a Court which can enforce it, for if no other mode of enforcing it is prescribed, that alone is sufficient to give jurisdiction to the King\u2019s Courts of Justice.\nThe appeal is allowed with costs, and there will be judgment for the appellant (plaintiff) for the amount claimed with interest and costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: MacBeth & MacBeth.\nSolicitor for the respondent: C.M.

While a draft lease was signed by defendant (the findings below to this effect being sustained) and the signed copy received by plaintiff, this, under the circumstances, evidenced nothing more than an offer to become lessee upon the terms set forth, and plaintiff could not rely upon that offer beyond a reasonable time; and plaintiff did not itself sign or deliver the lease, or agree to do so except upon a condition never fulfilled, until after such lapse of time and material change of circumstances as rendered it too late for plaintiff to be entitled to make the lease effective and engage defendant\u2019s liability by executing and forwarding a copy. Defendant had never entered or exercised any possession; and it was a certain company (contemplated to be the actual occupier of the property, and originally proposed as lessee) and not the defendant, who was at all times recognized by plaintiff as having the use and occupation of the property.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], which, reversing the judgment of Kelly J., held that the plaintiff\u2019s action, which was for arrears of rent claimed to be payable by the defendant under an alleged lease, should be dismissed. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was dismissed with costs.\nI.F. Hellmuth, K.C. and F.C. Betts for the appellant.\nD.L. McCarthy, K.C. and S.A. Hayden for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nNEWCOMBE J.\u2014The plaintiff sues for arrears of rent alleged to be payable by the defendant under a lease dated 20th April, 1926. There are two volumes of testimony and documents; but the material facts for the disposition of this appeal are comprised in the following narrative:\nThe plaintiff company was incorporated in 1923, under the laws of the State of Rhode Island, for the purpose of promoting industrial development and the employment of labour at the City of Newport, Rhode Island, in co-operation with the Chamber of Commerce. In January, 1926, it acquired, for the price of $85,000, which it borrowed from the local banks, a property situate at Newport, which, having been used as a chewing gum factory, had recently been abandoned by the previous tenants. The plaintiff was evidently desirous that the city should not be left without a chewing gum factory, and the employment which its activities would afford, and, in seeking a new tenant who would carry on the industry, came into touch with the Everybody\u2019s Chewing Gum Corporation, then operating a factory in Newark, N.J. There were negotiations for a lease, in which the latter company was represented by Henry E. Short and his son, Percy H. Short, its President and Treasurer, respectively; of whom Percy H. Short appears to have been the principal director of the business.\nProposals were submited and favourably entertained, and the plaintiff, by letter of 6th January, 1926, agreed, upon the terms and conditions therein stipulated, to lease the vacant property, with an option of purchase, to the Everybody\u2019s Chewing Gum Corporation, for a period of twenty years, to begin 10th February, 1926, at the rent of $10,000 per annum for the first ten years, payable monthly in advance; and, during the second ten years, at a rent, payable in like manner, to be agreed upon, or, if the parties could not agree, to be fixed by arbitration. By the fifth clause, it was stipulated that\nThe lessee shall furnish to the lessor a guarantee in writing with surety or sureties satisfactory to the lessor, whereby the said surety or sureties guarantees or guarantee the payment of all rents provided for in said lease for said full term of twenty years, including that to be fixed by arbitration.\nOptions of purchase were provided for, and also the various details. This offer proved acceptable, and by a note, written at the foot of the letter,\nEverybody\u2019s Chewing Gum Corporation hereby accepts the provisions of the above contract, subject to the conditions therein stated.\nThe letter was signed, for the plaintiff company, by Charles Tisdall, President, and Thos. B. Congdon, Treasurer; and the acceptance, for the Everybody\u2019s Chewing Gum Corporation, by Henry E. Short, President, and Percy H. Short, Treasurer; and the document, as so executed, was returned to the plaintiff by letter of 9th January, signed \u201cEverybody\u2019s Chewing Gum Corporation, H.E. Short, President,\u201d and addressed to Walter Clemens Campbell, the Secretary of the Newport Chamber of Commerce. There is no question about Mr. Campbell\u2019s authority to receive this communication on behalf of the plaintiff company; he is treated throughout the case as having competent authority for the business which he transacted. There is an entry in the plaintiff\u2019s minute book of 14th January, that an agreement had been reached in accordance with the terms submitted by the Board of Directors at its meeting on 6th January, and it was resolved that, upon the acquisition of the title and performance of the other conditions as stipulated, the President and Treasurer be authorized to sign and execute for the Newport Industrial Development Company a lease to the Everybody\u2019s Chewing Gum Corp. in accordance with said agreement of January 6th, 1926.\nIn this posture of affairs it would appear that the Everybody\u2019s Company, with the plaintiff\u2019s consent, entered into possession of the premises; and it remained in possession uninterruptedly until February or March, 1927, when it became bankrupt.\nIn a letter of 20th January, signed \u201cApple Gum Corporation, P.H. Short, Secretary,\u201d and addressed to Mr. Campbell, referring to security for payment of the rent, which was to be given by the United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company, it is said, \u201cEnclosed find cheque on Canada.\u201d It is not perfectly clear, but apparently the business transacted at Newark, N.J., had been carried on under the name of the Apple Gum Corporation, and on that account some confusion is apt occasionally to be introduced into the correspondence, which relates entirely to the Everybody\u2019s Company. The cheque referred to was not, in fact, enclosed, and Mr. Campbell wrote to Mr. Short on 21st January,\nYou also indicate that a cheque was enclosed, but through some oversight it was not enclosed with your communication of the 20th.\nOn the following day Mr. Short wrote to Mr. Campbell,\nI hasten to forward cheque which I intended to enclose in my previous letter.\nThe explanation is found in a letter written on the same day by Percy H. Short to his Aunt Susie, the defendant, and Uncle William Heughan, her husband, jointly, who reside and carry on a dry goods business at London, Ontario. In this letter Mr. Short says,\n* * * I have figured out that I don\u2019t want Newport Industrial Co. to get any money from Everybody\u2019s, so have asked them to return Everybody\u2019s cheque of $833.34, and I\u2019m sending them cheque of same amount as though it is from you. I enclose you exact copy of cheque I sent them, so on Monday when I get cheque back from them, will send you cheque of $833.34, and will you please deposit in your account, and give Mr. Goodall your cheque for $833.34 to pay the cheque I have drawn.\nTo make it clear.\nI gave cheque as per copy to Newport, $833.34.\nI will send you our cheque for $833.34.\nYou deposit our cheque $833.34 in your bank.\nYou give Mr. Goodall, Imperial Bank cheque of $833.34 to pay cheque I gave Newport.\nEach month I will send you $833.34 to mail. * * * Mr. Goodall was the Manager of the Imperial Bank at London. Mr. and Mrs. Heughan were carrying on business there as partners under the name of \u201cHeughan & Co.\u201d In consequence of this communication of 22nd January, Mrs. Heughan sent her cheque, or that of Heughan & Co., for $833.34, to the plaintiff company, that being the amount of one month\u2019s rent, plus one cent; and, in fact, as resolved by Mr. Short, in accordance with his letter, throughout the period during which rent was paid on behalf of the Everybody\u2019s Corporation, namely, until January, 1927 inclusive, the rent was paid in the manner indicated; that is to say, a cheque of the Everybody\u2019s Company was deposited at London to the defendant\u2019s credit, and the defendant sent Heughan & Co\u2019s cheque to the plaintiff. Meantime there had been no communications whatever between the appellant company and the defendant, and the cheques, when acknowledged by the plaintiff, were acknowledged, not to the defendant, but to Percy H. Short, or to the Everybody\u2019s Company. For example, on 26th January, Mr. Campbell wrote to Mr. Short, at 342 Madison Avenue, New York, where he or the Everybody\u2019s Company had an office:\nI am returning herewith the cheque from the Everybody\u2019s Gum Co. forwarded to me some time ago.\nI also wish to acknowledge receipt of cheque for $833.34 on the Imperial Bank of Canada.\nThere is an extract from the plaintiff\u2019s income book shewing credits for the cheques of Heughan & Co. so received, as follows:\n1926:\nFebruary 3, Everybody\u2019s, etc., $830.22.\nMarch 12, Everybody\u2019s, etc., $833.34.\nApril 14, Everybody\u2019s, etc., $833.34.\nMay 17, Susie Heughan for \u201cChewing Gum Co.\u201d, $833.34.\nJune 10, Heughan & Co., \u201cfor Gum Co.\u201d, $833.34.\nJuly 13, Heughan & Co., \u201cfor Gum Co.\u201d, $833.34.\nAugust 12, Heughan & Co., \u201cfor Gum Co.\u201d, $833.34.\nSeptember 22, Everybody\u2019s Chewing Gum Co., $833.34.\nOctober 13, Everybody\u2019s Chewing Gum, $833.34.\nNovember 19, Everybody\u2019s Chewing Gum, $833.34.\nDecember 20, Everybody\u2019s Chewing Gum, $833.34.\n1927:\nJanuary 21, Everybody\u2019s Chewing Gum, $833.34.\nA formal lease for execution was prepared under the instructions of the plaintiff company, bearing date the day of March, 1926, in which the plaintiff is described as the lessor, and Everybody\u2019s Chewing Gum Corporation as the lessee. It contains a covenant on the part of the lessee to pay rent at the rate of $833.33 monthly in advance for the term of ten years, beginning 10th February, 1926; and, for the remainder of the term, at an agreed rate, or as fixed by arbitration.\nIt had been orally proposed, on the part of the Gum Company, that Percy H. Short\u2019s aunt, the defendant, should guarantee payment of the rent for the entire period of the lease, and the plaintiff had made some enquiries as to her means, and, in consequence, was apparently satisfied to accept her as a guarantor, provided a guaranty company became an additional surety. Accordingly, there was endorsed on the form of lease, which the plaintiff sent to the Gum Company, a formal guaranty, to be executed under seal by the defendant, whereby she was to guarantee \u201cthe payment when due of rent for the entire period of 20 years.\u201d The Gum Company referred the draft lease to its solicitors, and they suggested some alterations, which were accepted, and, on 9th March, Messrs. Sheffield & Harvey, the plaintiff\u2019s solicitors, wrote to Messrs. Thomas & Freedman, who represented the Gum Company, enclosing a re-draft and saying:\nWe are, therefore, enclosing the lease redrafted, and would ask you to kindly have this executed in duplicate, returning both copies to us for signature, and accompanying same with a vote of your corporation authorizing the President and Treasurer to execute the lease.\nWe understand that under an arrangement with the company Miss Heughan is going to guarantee the payment of this rent and that the United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company will deliver, simultaneously with it, a bond in the sum of $10,000, guaranteeing the performance by the company.\nBut, on 24th March, Percy H. Short wrote Mr. Campbell:\nI expect to be with Thomas & Freedman to-morrow and go over the leases with Mr. Freedman which your attorney sent. I wish you would please write me if it will be satisfactory to your people to have the lease made out to Susie P. Heughan, and guaranteed by Everybody\u2019s Chewing Gum Corp. It will mean a good deal to me to have the lease made out in this way, and I trust therefore, that you will write me that this is satisfactory.\nAnd, by letter of 27th March, Mr. Campbell replied:\nThe Industrial Development Co. would be agreeable to your changing the lease to Susie Heughan, lessee, and guaranteed by Everybody\u2019s Gum Corporation, provided the security as outlined in the form of lease forwarded to you is obtained.\nWe cannot, of course, say that it will be entirely satisfactory to our banks, but we will be glad to submit the lease to them and urge their acceptance when you have returned same properly executed. On 30th March, the Gum Corporation acknowledged this letter, saying:\nWe appreciate your information regarding the lease, and we naturally expect to furnish the security as outlined.\nThe plaintiff then caused to be prepared and delivered to Mr. Short a corresponding draft lease, in duplicate, wherein the defendant is described as lessee, and the Gum Company is substituted for the defendant as guarantor of the rent, and, on 22nd April, Mr. Short wrote Mr. Campbell:\nEnclosed lease signed by my Aunt. I note they did not sign duplicate, but after your folks execute the duplicate and mail it to us, I can have our copy signed up, and you keep the original.\nOn 8th May, Mr. Campbell wrote Mr. Short:\nI am getting in a real \u201cjam\u201d on account of not having the bond to accompany the lease. Is there not some way to rush it through promptly so that I may have it first of next week, Tuesday at the latest.\nMr. Short\u2019s reply is dated 10th May, and he says:\nJust received your favour of the 8th inst., and I sincerely regret that the bond has not reached you, and I\u2019m getting right into this matter, and will not be contented until same is in your hands.\n* * *\nWill go right after the bond as I must get you out of the \u201cjam.\u201d\nOn 25th May, Thomas B. Congdon, the plaintiff company\u2019s Treasurer, wrote Mr. Short:\nAt the request of Mr. Campbell we enclose herewith a copy of the lease from the Newport Industrial Development Company to Susie Heughan for your use with the surety company whose bond you propose to furnish us in accordance with the agreement with the directors of the Newport Industrial Development Company. Upon receipt of the Surety Company bond and its approval by our attorney we will send to you the issue duly executed.\nIt is agreed that the antepenultimate word of this extract should read \u201clease,\u201d instead of \u201cissue.\u201d\nOn 27th May, Mr. Short wrote Mr. Campbell:\nReceived copy of lease yesterday, and had a meeting with the representative of the bonding company.\nWe can secure Ten Thousand Dollar bond, but the charge for same for one year is ($500) Five Hundred Dollars.\nThis price or charge seems to me to be exorbitant, and even though we were willing to go to this expense, I don\u2019t think your folks in Newport would expect us to go to such a tremendous expense.\n* * *\nIn the event your people insist on bond, I will immediately commence negotiations to purchase the plant, as it is within our power to do so, although with the extensive sales program we are inaugurating, the purchase plan would deter our production. In our opinion, your people are desirous that we attain a large production as quickly as possible, so as to make openings for a large number of employees, and this is the direction in which we are working. Mr. Campbell again wrote Mr. Short on 11th June:\nWe have canvassed the situation here with the banks quite carefully, and it seems to be considered as a part of the agreement to furnish the bond with the lease, and that the agreement should be kept.\nIt will be to the advantage of all concerned to keep this agreement and prevent any adverse criticism in case future banking accommodations are required.\nThis is the crux of the situation, as I see it, and while the price is high for the bond, yet it will be worth it in good will and confidence that will be established.\nOn 1st July, Mr. Campbell wrote the Mercantile Credit Company, of 321 Broadway, New York City:\nThe Everybody\u2019s Chewing Gum Corporation, 342 Madison Ave., New York, have leased a plant in this city, formerly occupied by the William Wrigley Co., for which they are paying $10,000 a year rental from February 10, 1926. The rent has been paid promptly in advance of the date due each month.\nAnd he gave some further particulars with regard to the constitution and standing of the Gum Company.\nThe plaintiff\u2019s solicitors, Messrs. Sheffield & Harvey, on 30th October, wrote to Hockstein & Zimmerman, 104 West 42nd St., New York City, enclosing form of guaranty bond \u201cfor the rent of Everybody\u2019s Chewing Gum Corporation property to the Newport Industrial Development Company,\u201d and enclosing a form of bond, whereby Everybody\u2019s Chewing Gum Corporation bound itself for payment of the rent. On 11th November, the Lancashire Agency Ltd. wrote Messrs. Sheffield & Harvey: \u201cRe indemnifying lease Everybody\u2019s Chewing Gum Corporation,\u201d making some suggestions and enquiries, to which the solicitors answered, on 12th November, as follows:\nYour letter of November 11th about the lease of the Newport Industrial Development Company to Everybody\u2019s Chewing Gum Corporation is duly received. Unfortunately after this lease was originally drawn they changed the name of lessee and failed to let us know about this, so that we did not have in our files a correct copy; as yet no lease has been executed.\nWe enclose herewith a copy of the document as completed thus far. We understand that the Lessor has not signed this because one of the conditions of signing was that the lease should give satisfactory guarantee from an insurance company.\nThere was a meeting of the plaintiff company on 23rd November, the minutes of which are produced. They relate to a conference with Percy H. Short as to guaranty of the lease, wherein he related \u201cthe difficulties which they (the Gum Company) had encountered in trying to secure a bond to cover the lease for a period of years,\u201d and evidence a final decision that * * * the best they (the Gum Company) could do would be to give a bond for $10,000 covering the lease for one year, the same to be renewed for each year to follow, and the bonding company would require the name of Susie Heughan to be released from the lease and placed on the bond as surety.\nThe Vice-President advised Mr. Short that this would not be a satisfactory arrangement and that the banks would require more surety to cover the lease.\nMr. Short then advised that the Everybody\u2019s Chewing Gum Corporation would proceed to purchase the building at the optional price mentioned in the lease; namely, $85,000, and that it would probably require about sixty days to consummate the purchase.\nOn 27th November, Mr. Campbell wrote Mr. Short:\nAnswering your request for information covering the buildings on Third Street now occupied by your company under lease from the Newport Industrial Development Company, we submit the following:\nand he mentions the various units and submits valuations of the land and buildings.\nOn 1st December, Mr. Congdon, the plaintiff\u2019s Treasurer, wrote Mr. Short:\nPlease be advised that we have received checks in payment for rent of the factory of the Newport Industrial Development Company, on Third Street, which is leased to Everybody\u2019s Chewing Gum Corporation, each check covering rental for one month in advance, as follows:\nand he proceeds with a statement of the monthly payments of rent received by the plaintiff, beginning 3rd February and ending 19th November, ten months in all.\nOn 8th December, Messrs. Sheffield & Harvey received a communication from the Lancashire Agency Ltd., reminding them that the documents relating to the surety bond for Everybody\u2019s Chewing Gum Corporation had not come to hand, and the solicitors replied that \u201cThe matter is being temporarily held up, pending a decision on the part of the lessees to purchase.\u201d\nThere was another meeting of the plaintiff company on 29th December, in which the financial condition of the Gum Company was considered; and on 5th January, 1927, Messrs. Sheffield & Harvey suggested to the Lancashire Agency that the latter should communicate directly with the Chewing Gum Company. Then there was a meeting of the plaintiff company on 1st March, of which the minutes read as follows:\nThe report of the committee having under consideration the financial condition of the Everybody\u2019s Chewing Gum Corporation was given by the Vice-President. He outlined the method followed in advancing loans to the Everybody\u2019s Chewing Gum Corporation on the receipt of open accounts with bills of lading attached. The total loans amounting to $13,000 have been extended to the Corporation and arrangements made with local banks as to plans for additional credit of $30,000.\nThe report was received.\nThe President reported the lease on the Third Street Building as having been signed by the president and treasurer.\nIt was moved by Titus, seconded by Friend, that the copy of the lease on the Third Street Building be forwarded to Mrs. Susie Heughan. Motion carried.\nIt may be inferred from the evidence that about this time the defendant received a copy of the lease by registered letter, and that she sent the document to Edwin J. Tetlow, of Providence, R.I., a lawyer. Her reason for this is stated in her testimony as follows:\nWell, I had received a letter from Percy some time before telling me that anything I received from Newport I should send to Tetlow, and not bother with it at all, because he thought these things might and would worry me.\nShe says the copy which she received was not signed at all, and that\nIt was the first and only thing I had ever seen in the way of a lease.\nThere is a letter, without date, postmarked at Newport 9th March, 1927, signed \u201cPercy H. Short for Susie P. Heughan,\u201d addressed to and received by the plaintiff company, stating:\nThis is to notify you that through failure on your part to deliver to me within a reasonable time after our negotiations an executed lease of the premises described as the Gum Company on the easterly side of Third Street in said City of Newport, bounded westerly on Third Street, southerly on land of A.B. Cascambas, easterly on land of the New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad and northerly on land of Kate Hunter Dunn, I will not now accept delivery of the lease of said premises which you drafted and dated the day of April, 1926, and proposed to execute and deliver to me for the term of 20 years from February 10. 1926, or any other lease of said premises.\nTo this the plaintiff company replied by James T. Kaull, Secretary, on 10th March, as follows:\nThe Newport Industrial Development Company received yesterday by registered mail a letter undated, signed by Percy H. Short, purporting to act for you, in which it is stated that because of our failure to deliver \u201cto me\u201d an executed lease of the Gum Company property, that the signer of the letter will not now accept any lease.\nWe beg to inform you that the Newport Industrial Development Company holds a lease of said premises, duly executed by you; that a copy of this lease was delivered, with your consent, to Percy H. Short, then acting for you; that you have, since the execution of said lease by you, entered into possession thereunder, paid rent provided for under the terms of said lease, and that the lessor will hold you liable and responsible for the performance of the covenants to be performed by you under said lease, including the payment of rent, for the full period of 20 years, as therein provided. It appears from a subsequent letter of 5th November, 1927, from the plaintiff\u2019s solicitors in this cause to the defendant\u2019s solicitors, that the plaintiff company had released the premises to a Delaware corporation for a period of five years from 1st November, 1927, at an annual rent of $7,000.\nThe action was brought by a specially endorsed writ of 12th May, 1927, claiming $3,333.33 for the stipulated payments of February, March, April and May, 1927, then overdue, and the defendant, in her affidavit of merits, alleges, among other defences:\nThat there is not now and never has been any privity of contract between me and the plaintiffs in respect of the said lands or otherwise howsoever.\nThe action was tried without pleadings, and Kelly J., the learned trial judge, found that the defendant had signed the lease, and that she was clearly under an obligation to pay, either as lessee or as guarantor; and he held, moreover, that nothing had happened to relieve her from her obligation to pay.\nThe appeal was heard by five learned judges of the Appellate Division, who, for various reasons, which were stated, agreed that the action failed[2], and Middleton J.A., one of these learned judges, expressed the view which, upon the foregoing evidence, appears to be perfectly sound, that\nThe negotiations between the parties never got beyond the stage of mere negotiation. There never was any actually completed transaction.\nThe defendant never entered or exercised any possession, and it was the Gum Company, and not the defendant, who was at all times recognized by the plaintiff as having the use and occupation of the property. There is no proof that either the Gum Company or Percy H. Short was the defendant\u2019s agent. That suggestion is denied by the defendant, and Short was not called. The defendant testifies that she did not sign the draft lease, but the signature looks like hers, and that issue has been found against her, both at the trial and upon the appeal, and these concurrent findings must stand. It required something more, however, to constitute the relationship of landlord and tenant between the parties.\nThe plaintiff company, although it received a copy of the lease, signed by the defendant, as early as April, 1926, did not itself sign or deliver the lease, or agree to do so, except conditionally, upon receiving the stipulated security of a guaranty company, which never was furnished, and it was not until the plaintiff company\u2019s meeting of 1st March, 1927, that it was resolved to execute and deliver the lease. Up to this time the plaintiff had not communicated at all with the defendant. Meantime the Gum Company had been continuously in possession, under the agreement of 6th January, 1926, and had not only utterly failed in the performance of the condition upon which the plaintiff would accept the defendant as its lessee, but also had made default in payment of the February rent, and had become insolvent; and it was by that time too late for plaintiff company, as said in its minutes of 1st March, 1927, \u201chaving under consideration the financial condition of Everybody\u2019s Chewing Gum Corporation,\u201d to make the lease effective and engage the defendant\u2019s liability by signing and forwarding to her a copy. The defendant\u2019s signature, which is found to be written upon the copy that the plaintiff received from Percy H. Short, evidenced nothing more than an offer at that time to become lessee upon the terms set forth, and the plaintiff could not rely upon that offer beyond a reasonable time, or, after nearly a year had passed, and when the conditions, under which the defendant was content to accept the responsibility of lessee, had disappeared, or materially changed, by reason of the collapse of the gum business at Newport.\nThere are other serious difficulties in the plaintiff\u2019s way, which were considered in the Appellate Division, and urged on behalf of the respondent at the hearing in this Court; but holding the view which I have expressed, it is not necessary new to consider whether these can be overcome.\nThe appeal will be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Cronyn & Betts.\nSolicitors for the respondent: McCarthy & McCarthy.\n[1] (1928) 62 Ont.

(f).\nFor the purposes of appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, \u201cthe amount or value of the matter in controversy in the appeal\u201d depends, not on what is claimed in the action, but on what may be contested in the proposed appeal (Dreifus v. Royds, 64 Can. S.C.R. 346). Where a plaintiff seeks to appeal against the dismissal of his action by a provincial appellate court, after he had recovered at the trial a pecuniary judgment for an amount (with allowable interest) less than $1,000, but from which he had not cross-appealed, the Supreme Court of Canada has no jurisdiction to grant special leave to appeal under clause (f) of the proviso to s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act, as the utmost relief which he can possibly obtain on the appeal is the restoration of the trial judgment, in which, by not appealing against it, he has acquiesced. (Monette v. Lefebvre, 16 Can. S.C.R. 387, and other cases, referred to.)\nMOTION by the plaintiff, under the proviso to s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 35) for special leave to appeal to this Court from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], special leave to appeal having been refused by the Appellate Division.\nThe motion was refused with costs.\nJ. Jack (applicant in person) for the motion.\nA.W.

The only clause of the proviso which can possibly apply to this case is that which enables this Court to grant special leave, refused below, (f) In cases * * * in which the amount or value of the matter in controversy in the appeal will exceed the sum of one thousand dollars.\nThe plaintiff\u2019s claim was for $2,000 damages and, at the trial, he recovered judgment for $250. On appeal by the defendant, that judgment was set aside by the Appellate Divisional Court and the action dismissed. The plaintiff did not cross-appeal to that court from the judgment at the trial.\nWhatever doubt may have existed in the past as to the basis upon which the value of the matter in controversy should be determined for the purposes of appeal to this Court, since the amendment of 1920, enacting the proviso above referred to, it is beyond question that \u201cthe amount or value of the matter in controversy in the appeal\u201d depends not on what is claimed in the action, but on what may be contested in the proposed appeal. Dreifus v. Royds[2]. In the case of a plaintiff seeking to appeal against the dismissal of his action by a provincial appellate court, after he had recovered at the trial a pecuniary judgment for an amount (with allowable interest) less than $1,000, but from which he had not cross appealed, the utmost relief which he can possibly obtain in this Court is the restoration of the trial judgment, in which, by not appealing against it, he has acquiesced.\nIt follows that the amount or value of the matter in controversy in this appeal is, at the outside, the sum of $250, with the possible addition of some interest; in any event, an amount much less than $1,000.\nMoreover, under the proviso of s. 41 referred to, the application for special leave to appeal must be made to this Court within the sixty days from the entry or pronouncement of the judgment to be appealed from fixed by s. 64, or within thirty days thereafter. This time has long since expired. But, assuming in favour of the applicant that he has made a case for the exercise of the discretion conferred on the Court by 15-16 Geo. V., c. 27, s. 3 (R.S.C., 1927, c. 35, s. 41) to extend this period, the fact that the amount or value of the matter in controversy in the appeal is clearly less than $1,000 is fatal to our jurisdiction to grant the present motion. The motion will, accordingly, be refused with costs. A decision directly in point is the case of Monette v. Lefebvre, which has been since approved in Laberge v. Equitable Life Ass. Soc.; Beauchemin v. Armstrong; and Beauvais v. Genge.\nMotion refused with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Ewart, Scott, Kelley & Kelley.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Trevor H.

Rowlings (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1929: May 1, 2; 1929: May 27.\nPresent: Duff, Mignault, Newcombe, Lamont and Smith JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA, EN BANC\nSolicitor\u2014Company\u2014Director of company acting as its solicitor\u2014Claim for payment for legal services\u2014Whether a \u201ctrustee\u201d within s. 56 of the Trustee Act, R.S.N.S., 1923, c. 212.\nPlaintiff, who was a director and vice-president of defendant company, acted as its solicitor (although not formally appointed as such) in a great number of matters, and was consulted, and his advice sought, by his co-directors and the officers of the company. His co-directors were aware of his so acting, and he was paid substantial amounts on account of the legal services rendered from time to time. He sued on an account for legal services rendered.\nHeld, reversing judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc ([1929] 2 D.L.R. 519), that he could not recover; his position as director of the company incapacitated him from engaging as its solicitor, on principles of law laid down in Aberdeen Ry. Co. v. Blaikie, Bros., 1 MacQueen, 461, at p. 471; North-West Transportation Co. v. Beatty, 12 App. Cas., 589, at p. 593; Broughton v. Broughton, 5 De G. M. & G., 160, at p. 164. He was not a \u201ctrustee\u201d within the meaning of the enabling s. 56 of the Nova Scotia Trustee Act, R.S.N.S., 1923, c. 212. In re Lands Allotment Co., [1894] 1 ch. 616, distinguished.\nAPPEAL by the defendant, a company incorporated in 1922 under the provisions of The Nova Scotia Companies Act (1921, c. 19; now R.S. N. S., 1923, c. 174), from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc[1] dismissing its appeal from the judgment of Carroll J.1 confirming and varying (by increasing the amount allowed) the decision or report of His Honour Walter Crowe, Co. C. J.1, as special referee appointed under order of Jenks J., in an action by the plaintiff claiming payment for legal services rendered by him to the defendant.\nThe material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was allowed, with costs in this court and in the court below, and the action dismissed with costs.\nC. B. Smith K.C. and R. S. McLellan K.C. for the appellant.\nT. R. Robertson K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nNewcombe J.\u2014I have examined this case with some anxiety, hoping to find that the law has made provision whereby the plaintiff may be compensated for his services, but I have reluctantly come to the conclusion that his case breaks down irretrievably upon the main point.\nThe material facts are stated in a compact and orderly fashion by the learned County Court Judge, who was the Referee in the case. I quote the following passage from his report:\nThe salient facts, as I find them, and as to which I think there is no serious dispute, briefly are that the defendant company was incorporated in 1922 under the Nova Scotia Companies Act, chap. 174 R.S. The plaintiff, who is a Barrister and Solicitor of this Court of many years\u2019 standing, and a King\u2019s Counsel, took the necesasry steps to incorporate the Company, of which he was one of the promoters and provisional directors, and he was paid for that service. At a later stage in the Company\u2019s history the plaintiff became a Director and its Vice-president, and I find that during the period covered by the accounts referred to he was a Director and Vice-president of defendant company. I find that no formal appointment of plaintiff as the Solicitor of the Company was made, certainly no express resolution to that effect was ever passed by the Board of Directors, or if it was no evidence was offered about it. I find, however, and of this there can be no doubt, that plaintiff did act as the Company\u2019s Solicitor in a great number of matters, that he was freely consulted and his advice sought by his co-directors and the officers of the company, and of his so acting his fellow directors were well aware. Indeed he was paid substantial amounts on account of the legal services he had rendered or was rendering to the company from time to time.\nThe Referee found for the plaintiff upon items of the accounts filed, amounting to $1,876.48, and Carroll J., upon motion before him to adopt or vary the report, increased the amount found by the addition of some further items; confirmed the report in other respects, and directed judgment to be entered for $2,730.48 (corrected by the judgment of the Supreme Court en banc to $2,630). There was an appeal and a cross-appeal to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, sitting en banc, and both appeal and cross-appeal were dismissed (subject to the variation aforesaid); Jenks J. dissenting. He would have allowed the appeal.\nThe appellant company relies upon the principle enunciated by Lord Cranworth, L.C., in Aberdeen Railway Co. v. Blakie Brothers[2] that\na corporate body can only act by agents, and it is of course the duty of those agents so to act as best to promote the interests of the corporation whose affairs they are conducting. Such agents have duties to discharge of a fiduciary nature towards their principal. And it is a rule of universal application, that no one, having such duties to discharge, shall be allowed to enter into engagements in which he has, or can have, a personal interest conflicting, or which possibly may conflict, with the interests of those whom he is bound to protect.\nThis doctrine is affirmed by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in North-West Transportation Company v. Beatty[3], where Sir Richard Baggallay, pronouncing the judgment, says:\nUnless some provision to the contrary is to be found in the charter or other instrument by which the company is incorporated, the resolution of a majority of the shareholders, duly convened, upon any question with which the company is legally competent to deal, is binding upon the minority, and consequently upon the company, and every shareholder has a perfect right to vote upon any such question, although he may have a personal interest in the subject matter opposed to, or different from, the general or particular interests of the company.\nOn the other hand, a director of a company is precluded from dealing, on behalf of the company, with himself, and from entering into engagements in which he has a personal interest conflicting, or which possibly may conflict, with the interests of those whom he is bound by fiduciary duty to protect; and this rule is as applicable to the case of one of several directors as to a managing or sole director.\nThe rule is, indeed, so well established and familiar as to require no citation of authority. It is applied in the case of a solicitor-trustee in relation to his profit-costs, as in Broughton v. Broughton[4]. So far there seems to be no dispute.\nBut the respondent objects that the appellant is not entitled to raise that contention; that it is not set up in his pleadings. I think, however, that the pertinent facts are sufficiently stated by paragraphs 3 and 4 of the defence, wherein the existing relation between the parties is in fact alleged; moreover, no effect was given to the objection by the court en banc, where, presumably, the adequacy of the pleadings was considered in the light of the local practice, if the question were raised in that court; and therefore I think we must proceed upon the view that if, according to the law, the claim cannot be enforced, there is sufficient in the defence to enable the court to decide in conformity.\nThe respondent\u2019s principal answer, and that to which the majority of the court en banc gave effect, rests upon a. 56 of the Nova Scotia Trustee Act U.S. N.S., 1923, c. 212, whereby it is enacted that:;\n56. Where there are more executors, administrators, trustees or guardians than one, any one of such executors, administrators, trustees or guardians who is also a solicitor may with the consent of his co-executors, co-administrators, co-trustees or co-guardians, charge for professional services rendered by him in relation to the estate in the same manner as if he were not such executor, administrator, trustee, or guardian: Provided, however, that no such charge shall be made for any service which an executor, administrator, trustee or guardian ought to render without the intervention of a solicitor.\nThis was the chief topic discussed at the hearing, and my view, which I have reached upon very careful consideration, is that the legislature has not, by this provision, manifested an intention to include the directors of a company, as such, within the class of trustees to which the enactment is meant to apply. The collocation of the words, \u201cexecutors, administrators, trustees or guardians\u201d, as descriptive of the persons for whose benefit the dispensation is made, coupled with the limitation of the professional services, which are the subject-matter of the clause, to those rendered \u201cin relation to the estate\u201d, make it to my mind extremely unlikely that a solicitor, if not a trustee otherwise than because he is a director of a company, is within the purview of the section. The reading of the text is not only inapt to draw attention to the ordinary case of a director, but it seems, upon my interpretation, more likely to stifle any suggestion that a mere director is intended to share in the benefit of the provision. And, however the case may stand as to a director, who has in hand money or property of the company, and who is thus, in a qualified sense, a trustee, whether within the application of s. 56 or not, the respondent here is no more than an agent who is endeavouring, without any enabling clause, to justify the transaction in question, and to recover reward for his services by reason of instructions emanating from himself and his co-directors. This is not a case of dual capacity, such as that to which James, L. J., referred in Smith v. Anderson[5], when he observes that\nthe same individual may fill the office of director and also be a trustee having property, but that is a rare, exceptional, and casual circumstance.\nOn the other hand, the respondent\u2019s disqualification arises only by reason of his quality as agent of the company; as is said by Lord Selborne, L.C., in Great Eastern Railway Co. v. Turner[6]\nThe directors are the mere trustees or agents of the company\u2014trustees of the company\u2019s money and property\u2014agents in the transactions which they enter into on behalf of the company.\nThe majority of the court below appears to have reached a different view upon the authority of In re Lands Allotment Company[7]. In that case, the company was being wound up, and it was said that the directors had engaged in a transaction which was ultra vires of the company. What they had done, in effect, was this: One Hobbs was indebted to the company to the extent of \u00a335,000, and a company called the Building Securities Company was formed to purchase his business and to take over his assets and liabilities. It thus became the duty of the Building Securities Company, as between it and Hobbs, to pay off that sum of \u00a335,000, and it did so by purporting to sell its shares to that amount to the Lands Allotment Company which sent the Securities Company its cheque for the sum, upon the understanding that the cheque should be immediately returned. Hobbs\u2019 debt was thus repaid in a manner which is described as a farce. In point of fact, it was a mere paper transaction; the cheque was handed back on the following day, and, as stated by Lindley, L. J.,\nthe real substance of that transaction, when you see through the cloak which is thrown around it, is that the Lands Allotment Company took \u00a335,000 worth of shares in the Building Securities Company in satisfaction of Hobbs\u2019 debt. That was what was really done.\nLindley, L. J., considered the case upon the assumption that the transaction was ultra vires, and therefore that the directors were liable to make good the money; and the question was whether they were protected by the Statute of Limitations relating to trustees, c. 59, s. 8, of 1888; it was held in the affirmative, and upon the view, if I correctly interpret the meaning, that the directors had committed a breach of trust; that directors, although not, properly speaking, trustees, have always been considered as trustees of money which comes to their hands, or is actually under their control, and liable to make good that which they have misapplied, upon the same footing as if they were trustees; that s. 8 of the Trustee Act, 1888, applies to trustees, and includes\na trustee whose trust arises by construction or implication of law as well as an express trustee;\nand that directors are considered as express trustees of money which they have control of, or, if not, that they are certainly trustees by construction or implication of law, within the definition of the Act. Kay, L. J., makes the matter very clear at pages 638 and 639, where he says:\nThen comes the question, what was the position of the directors who made an improper and ultra vires investment of that kind? Now, case after case has decided that directors of trading companies are not for all purposes trustees or in the position, of trustees, or quasi trustees, or to be treated as trustees in every sense; but if they deal with the funds of a company, although those funds are not absolutely vested in them, but funds which are under their control, and deal with those funds in a manner which is beyond their powers, then as to that dealing they are treated as having committed a breach of trust.\n* * *\nIt is said, by way of argument, \u201cWhy did not the definition clause expressly include directors?\u201d But it would have been quite wrong to have included directors, because directors are not always trustees. As directors they are not trustees at all. They are only trustees qu\u00e2 the particular property which is put into their hands or under their control, and which they have applied in a manner which is beyond the powers of the company. I conceive that qu\u00e2 such fund they are constructive trustees, or trustees by implication of law, and they come exactly within the words of this definition in the Act, and therefore the 8th section of the Act, which applies to all persons who come within this definition of trustees, does apply to exonerate these directors from that misapplication of funds for which otherwise, I assume, they would have been liable. The case of the Lands Allotment Company[8], upon this point, may therefore be taken as a mere example or illustration of the principle affirmed by Jessel, M.R., when he said in In re Wincham Shipbuilding, Boiler, and Salt Co.; Poole, Jackson and Whyte\u2019s case[9]:\nIt has always been held that the directors are trustees for the shareholders, that is, for the company. They are the managing partners of the company, and if they abuse their powers, which they hold in trust for the company, to the damage of the company, for their own benefit, they are liable to make good the breach of trust to their cestuis que trust like any other trustees.\nThe directors had misused their powers. They were charged with the resulting liability, and, the proceeding not being within the statutory exception, they were naturally held entitled to the protection of the statute.\nUpon this review of the Lands Allotment case8, I do not think it affords the respondent any assistance. His case is entirely different. He is seeking to recover from the appellant company, for services rendered under a contract, which, by the general principles of the law, is incapable of being enforced, and the company resists the demand, relying upon the director\u2019s incapacity. The respondent has no money or property of the company in his hands; he is not subject to any action for breach of trust; rather, it seems, he is endeavouring to persuade the court to sanction a breach of trust.\nFor these reasons I do not think that the respondent can be regarded as a trustee for the purposes of s. 56 of the Nova Scotia Trustee Act.\nIt follows that the appeal must be allowed and the action dismissed with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: R.

Morton, Administrator Of The Trust and One of The Executors and Trustees of The Estate of Sam Brighouse, Deceased (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1929:February 6, 7; 1929: April 30.\nPresent: Duff, Newcombe, Rinfret, Lamont and Smith JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nTrusts and trustees\u2014Accounting\u2014Accounting to deceased's estate as to receipts and expenditures in connection with deceased's affairs\u2014Disputed items\u2014Whether payments properly chargeable to estate\u2014Findings on the evidence\u2014Corroboration\u2014Mingling of funds of trustee and cestui que trust\u2014Presumption as to funds of unidentified origin\u2014Mingling authorized by cestui que trust.\nBy the judgment of this Court, [1927] S.C.R. 118, defendant was held accountable for all moneys of the late S. B. received by him since February 6, 1907 (except as to gifts completed within S. B.'s lifetime) and was held entitled to all just and proper allowances for expenditures made, and for costs, charges and expenses incurred by him in or in relation to or in connection with S. B's affairs. On the accounting, disputes arose as to certain items, which, by the judgment now reported, were decided by this Court as follows:\n(1) As to certain payments by defendant to discharge a liability of S. B. for money borrowed from a bank for which a demand note was given, it being contended that the money was used for a business given by S. B. to defendant, and that, as between defendant and S. B., the note was a liability of defendant rather than of S. B.; held that there was no evidence that the money was received by defendant after February 6, 1907, or at any time, and therefore it was not money for which defendant was accountable by the said former judgment of this Court, upon which the accounting must proceed; and, moreover, the payments were expenditures or charges incurred by defendant \"in or in relation to or in connection with the affairs\" of S. B.; and the items should be allowed to defendant.\n(2) As to sums charged by defendant as paid to his brother W., deceased, for W.'s wages for work on S. B.'s farm, as to which it was contended that there was no proof or presumption that the services of W. (who was S. B.'s nephew and lived with him on his farm) were to be paid for, and that the payments were not really for wages but on account of the sale price of land which defendant and W. had sold and in which each had a half interest, and that there was no corroboration of defendant's evidence that he appropriated the payments to wages or that W. was entitled to wages; held, that the sums should be allowed to defendant; on the evidence, and with due regard to the rule requiring corroboration in such cases (Evidence Act, B.C., s. 11) there was ample proof of the payments and of their imputation on account of wages, and there was no evidence to the contrary beyond an inference sought to be drawn from certain circumstances, but which was negatived by the evidence; as to W. having an enforceable claim against S. B. on a presumed or implied agreement, the circumstances possibly justified the inference of a legal demand, but, in any event, the payments to W. constituted expenditures by defendant in relation to S. B.'s affairs, there was no reason to doubt that they were made honestly and within the scope of defendant's authority as proved, and therefore they should not be disallowed on the ground that possibly W. could not have established his claim for wages by strict proof of a contract for payment; the situation, under the circumstances, was one as to which defendant was entitled to exercise his judgment in the administration of his authority with relation to S. B.'s affairs. (Lamont J. dissented as to this allowance, holding that, on a consideration of all the evidence, there was no corroboration of defendant's statement that S. B. told him to pay wages to W. or that the sums were paid as wages.)\n(3) As to certain sums deposited by defendant in his bank account, the origin of which sums he was, after the long time elapsed, unable to identify, and as to which it was contended that, since defendant admittedly deposited moneys of S. B., along with his own, in his individual account, he was responsible for an unlawful mingling of funds, and moneys not shown to have belonged to defendant must be taken to have belonged to S. B.; held, that the reason underlying the principle invoked by such contention did not apply in this case, where it was found that S. B. himself had authorized and encouraged defendant to dispense with a separate account and to keep the entries in the manner in which the account appeared; it would be inequitable, and also inconsistent with the judgment which regulated the accounting, that defendant should be held accountable for deposits not admitted or identified as belonging to the estate; as to the contention that defendant could not plead the authority derived from S. B. because S. B. became insane, held, that, on the evidence in this regard, no revocation or suspension of authority at the material time was established.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia, 40 B.C. Rep. 278, reversed on the above questions.\nAPPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] which decided in favour of the plaintiff upon the items of account in question in the present appeal. The disputes arose in connection with the accounting by the defendant pursuant to the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada reported in [1927] S.C.R. 118. The material facts of the case appear in that judgment together with the judgment now reported. The appeal was allowed with costs, Lamont J. dissenting in part. Ghent Davis for the appellant.\nW. D. Gillespie for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Duff, Newcombe, Rinfret and Smith JJ. was delivered by\nNEWCOMBE J.\u2014The writ was issued 13th June, 1924, and the action, which was for an account, has been productive of considerable litigation. The defendant, now appellant, disputed his liability to account, and succeeded at the trial, and, upon an equal division of judicial opinion, in the Court of Appeal in British Columbia[2] . But a different view prevailed in this Court[3], and the defendant was ultimately held accountable, subject to the provisions of the judgment. The case is reported, sub nomine Morton v. Brighouse, in [1927] S.C.R., 118. The material clauses of the judgment, for present purposes, are these:\nAND THIS COURT DOTH FURTHER ORDER AND ADJUDGE\nthat the respondent, Brighouse, is accountable for all moneys of the late Sam Brighouse, received by him since the 6th day of February, 1907, excepting money in respect of which the intended gift mentioned in the pleading was completed within the lifetime of the said Sam Brighouse.\nAND THIS COURT DOTH FURTHER ORDER AND ADJUDGE\nthat the respondent is entitled to all just and proper allowances for expenditures made by him, and for all costs, charges and expenses incurred by him in or in relation to or in connection with the affairs of the said Sam Brighouse.\nThree classes of items, and interest, are in dispute.\nFirst. These are payments amounting to $7,287.76, which were made by the defendant to the Bank of Montreal to discharge a liability of Sam Brighouse. The latter had borrowed $13,000 from the bank in June, 1906, for which he gave his demand note endorsed by his nephew, the defendant, and by the Royal Ice and Dairy Company, a concern which at that time belonged to Sam Brighouse, or in which he was interested, and he constructed upon the defendant's land the buildings and plant which were used for the purposes of that company. Subsequently Sam Brighouse gave the business to the defendant. It is satisfactorily proved, and is in fact not disputed, that the defendant made the payments, amounting to $7,287.76, on account of this loan. Sam Brighouse himself had made the preceding payments in reduction of his liability, and the amount in question was required to discharge the balance. It is in proof, however, that the defendant owned the ice business in 1909, although he did not own it in 1906 and 1907, and it is suggested, but not proved, that the money borrowed by Sam Brighouse in 1906 was used for that business, and that, as between the defendant and Sam Brighouse, the note was a liability of the defendant rather than of Sam Brighouse. There were differences of opinion in the provincial courts. The Deputy Registrar disallowed these charges, and the learned judge, before whom they came upon review, D. A. McDonald J., allowed them. In the Court of Appeal the majority upheld the Deputy Registrar. But it is certain that the proceeds of the loan were credited to Sam Brighouse's bank account, and were withdrawn by him in June, 1906; and, whether he used the money to construct the ice building or not, or whatever he used it for, there is no evidence that it was money received by the defendant after 6th February, 1907, or at any time, and therefore it is not money for which the defendant is accountable by the judgment of this Court, upon which the accounting must proceed; and, moreover, it cannot be successfully disputed that the payments were expenditures or charges incurred by the defendant \" in or in relation to or in connection with the affairs of the said Sam Brighouse.\" Consequently these items aggregating $7,287.76 should be allowed.\nSecond. There are payments amounting to $4,000, which the defendant charges as paid to his brother William A. Wilkinson, deceased, for the latter's wages for work done on the farm of Sam Brighouse, during the period from 1896 to 1913. The payments were made, and that is not disputed; but it is said that, although the services were rendered, there is no proof or presumption that they were to be paid for; that the payments were in reality not for wages, but on account of the sale price for Gulf lots, which the defendant and his brother had sold, and in which each of them had a half interest, and that there was no corroboration of the defendant's evidence that he appropriated the payments for wages or that his brother was entitled to wages. The items comprising this amount were disallowed by the Deputy Registrar for lack of corroboration, and they were allowed by D. A. McDonald J. upon the finding that \"the evidence is sufficiently corroborated that these moneys were paid to W. A. Wilkinson on instructions from the deceased Sam Brighouse, and they were moneys properly payable to W. A. Wilkinson.\" The Court of Appeal, in turn, disallowed these items; the Chief Justice, \"because there was no agreement by the deceased or by the defendant to pay wages to W. A. Wilkinson,\" and because \"this was not a transaction with which Sam Brighouse had anything to do\"; Martin J.A., considered that the Deputy Registrar was right. Galliher J.A., says that the defendant's evidence in connection with the payment of these items \"is far from convincing or sufficient in my opinion. I would therefore restore the Registrar's finding.\" M. A. MacDonald J.A., did not consider that there was sufficient corroboration of defendant's testimony to show \"that the brother was actually hired with the consent of the deceased to work in the farm.\"\nHere again, I am disposed to think that the learned judges did not pay proper regard to the judgment of this Court of 4th January, 1927, by which the accounts are directed to be taken. The first payment made by the defendant to his brother, amounting to $2,000, was paid on 15th December, 1909, and on that day the defendant received the sum of $4,000 on account of the sale of the Gulf lots. The defendant testifies:\nDecember 15, 1909, I paid to my brother W. A. Wilkinson, $2,000. This $2,000 I paid on account of wages. He had been on the farm for close since\u2014'96, that is for thirteen years at that time. He was on the farm until 1919, until Brighouse's death. Practically, he had received nothing, only a few dollars here and there. Sam Brighouse asked me many times\u2014told me many a time to pay him as soon as I could give him something. I paid him this $2,000 on account.\nThe second payment of $2,000 was actually made in four payments of $500 each by Mr. Sauerberg, who was the book-keeper of the Royal Ice Company during the years from 1908 on, when the defendant owned the business, and he testifies to the making of these payments on defendant's account. The defendant, at that time had been paid only $6,000, net, from the sale of the Gulf lots, and so, if the whole sum of $4,000 which is claimed, was paid by the defendant to his brother on account of the Gulf lots, it was more by $1,000 than the brother's share of the receipts. The whole proceeds of the sale were ultimately received by the defendant, and the total amount, with interest, was $52,462. This, with $30,000 more of the defendant's own money, was invested by the defendant in the Royal Mansions.\nThe defendant testifies that his brother was pressing him for money on account of wages and that he gave it to him, referring to the first payment of $2,000. He says: \"Now in making the deal in putting up the Royal Mansions I split even with him. I paid him that on account of his wages, or I would have taken that much out of him.\" And it is shown by the consent judgment in the will case, by which the Royal Mansions were declared to belong to the testator's (Sam Brighouse's) residuary estate, that this property passed to the estate, subject to a mortgage to the defendant for $25,000, and to a mortgage for a like amount to William A. Wilkinson, the defendant's brother; thus accounting for the proceeds of the Gulf lots in full by equal division between the brothers, except, perhaps, as to a balance of $2,462 in which the estate of William A. Wilkinson may still retain a one-half interest; but that matter has not been brought into question, nor has it been explained. It is, however, sufficiently plain that, if the $4,000, represented by the payments now in controversy, be regarded as part of the proceeds to William A. Wilkinson of the Gulf lots, he has been, to that extent, paid twice, an event which is very unlikely to happen by the payer's consent. The settlement thus furnishes strong corroboration of the defendant's denial that the payments of $4,000, which his brother received, were appropriated to the reduction of the defendant's liability for proceeds of the Gulf lots, and it is not suggested that there is an alternative motive for these payments, except wages. There is independent proof of the services, at least during the period from 1907 to 1913, which comprises the last six years of Sam Brighouse's life. The first payment of $2,000 was made by defendant's cheque, which is in evidence, and which was paid and charged to the defendant in his bank account. The other four payments of $500 were made by Sauerberg, and charged against the defendant in the books of the Royal Ice Company.\nThere is thus, with due regard to the rule requiring corroboration in cases of this character, ample proof of the payments in question, and of their imputation on account of wages, and there is no evidence to the contrary beyond the inference which is sought to be drawn from the fact that there was a liability of the defendant to his brother in respect of proceeds of the Gulf lots as to which the defendant might, if so disposed, have appropriated a payment of $2,000; an inference which, I think, is negatived by the evidence.\nThere remains the contention that William A. Wilkinson, being nephew of Sam Brighouse, and living on his farm, had no enforceable claim against his uncle for wages by reason of a presumed or implied agreement. I am not sure that the circumstances do not justify the inference of a legal demand, but, in any event, the payments constituted expenditures by the defendant in relation to the affairs of Sam Brighouse, and there is no reason to doubt that the defendant made the payments honestly, within the scope of his authority as proved; and, if so, it does not appear to me that the court would be justified to disallow the claim on the ground that perhaps the nephew could not have established his claim for wages against his uncle by strict proof of a contract for the payment of wages. The situation was one as to which, in my view of the circumstances, the defendant was entitled to exercise his judgment in the administration of his authority with relation to his uncle's affairs.\nThird. There are two other items, $992.80 and $668.30, aggregating $1,661.10, described as \"surcharge,\" which were disallowed, both by the Deputy Registrar and by all the judges. These two sums were deposited in the defendant's account in the Bank of Montreal on 23rd August and 26th September, 1910; the account does not specify the origin of either deposit, and the defendant, after the long time elapsed, is unable to identify them, except as deposits which he made; but there is, on the other hand, no proof that they belonged to Sam Brighouse. The plaintiff accordingly invokes the principle that, since the defendant admittedly has deposited the moneys of Sam Brighouse, along with his own, in his individual account, he is responsible for an unlawful mingling of the funds, and the moneys must, he says, belong to the cestui que trust, which are not shewn to belong to the trustee. This principle, in its usual application, the defendant does not dispute, but he answers the plaintiff's contention by the fact that, according to the proof, the account was kept in a manner authorized by Sam Brighouse, and that therefore neither he nor those claiming under him could, in the circumstances, equitably insist upon the surcharge, and the defendant cites par. 399 from Halsbury's Laws of England, Vol. 28, and Fletcher v. Collis[4]. I think the answer is well founded; it would be not only inequitable, but also inconsistent with the judgment which regulates the accounting, that the defendant should be held accountable for deposits which are not admitted or identified as belonging to the estate.\nIn Lupton v. White[5], Lord Eldon ruled that the distinction lies upon the person who occasions the confusion of property, and he explained that although the principle did not produce strict justice, it was the only justice that could be done; and that no more could be done was the fault of the accounting party. It is well enough to hold that where a trustee has confused the fund, the whole is to be treated as belonging to the trust, except so much as the trustee can distinguish as his own, but the reason underlying the principle manifestly does not apply in the present case, where it is found that Sam Brighouse himself had authorized and encouraged the defendant to dispense with a separate account, and to keep the entries in the manner in which the account appears.\nThe plaintiff suggests, however, that the defendant cannot plead the authority which he derived from Sam Brighouse, because Sam Brighouse became insane; thereby, I suppose, intending to intimate that the defendant's authority was revoked. The contention is thus stated in the appellant's factum :\nThe said Samuel Brighouse developed mental trouble after being at the hospital in December, 1908, which eventually led to insanity, so that he was not in a normal condition to acquiesce or concur in the acts of the appellant in mixing the trust funds of Samuel Brighouse with his own.\nNow the following facts are narrated in the judgment of this Court upon the former appeal:\nIn 1908, Brighouse had a serious operation, after which, according to the evidence of the respondent, his mental powers suffered a decline, and, as a result of which, he eventually became demented. In 1911, Brighouse executed a codicil to the will of 1906, making unimportant alterations in the particular legacies, but leaving the respondent still the beneficiary of his residuary estate. In 1912, Brighouse left Vancouver for England, and in the same year he executed a new will, the effect of which will be fully stated. In 1913 he died.\nThe deposits which it is sought to surcharge were, as already shown, made in August and September, 1910. Sam Brighouse went to the hospital in December, 1908. The defendant, in his cross-examination, gave the following testimony :\nQ. I think you told me also, on discovery, when your uncle went to the hospital, his trouble was all mental.\nA. I couldn't tell you it was all mental, because it was enlargement of the prostate gland, but it led to mental trouble. His doctor told me that would be the effect of it.\nHe appears to have recovered from the operation, because he subsequently returned to his home, and, in 1911, executed a codicil. In the same year he went to England, and there he made a new will in 1912, of which the plaintiff is one of the executors, and he died in 1913. There is no evidence as to the precise time when his mind sank into the condition of dementia, but I cannot draw the inference that he was not responsible for instructions to which he adhered in 1910, and I am satisfied that the appellant fails to establish any revocation or suspension of authority at the material time, while, on the contrary, the deceased was executing testamentary instruments in 1911 and 1912, the latter of which was admitted to probate and constitutes the respondent's title.\nIn consequence the defendant succeeds upon all the material items in dispute, and it is not necessary to consider the question of interest.\nThe appeal should therefore be allowed upon all items, with costs throughout.\nLAMONT J.\u2014This is an appeal from the decision of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia[6], in which it was held that the defendant was indebted to the plaintiff as administrator of the trust and one of the trustees of the estate of Sam Brighouse, deceased, in the sum of $7,986.63, with interest thereon from July 31, 1913. The action was for an accounting by the defendant of the moneys and property of the late Sam Brighouse which came into his hands. The defendant's name originally was Michael Wilkinson; Sam Brighouse was his uncle and, in compliance with a stipulation contained in his uncle's will, the defendant added the name of Brighouse to his own.\nThe defendant had been carrying on the business of Sam Brighouse under a power of attorney dated February 6, 1907. By a judgment of this Court[7] , the defendant was ordered to account for all the moneys of the late Sam Brighouse received by him after February 6, 1907, except moneys which constituted a completed gift to him by Brighouse during his lifetime. The accounting was had, and, by the judgment appealed against, the plaintiff was held entitled to recover the sum above mentioned. From that judgment the defendant has appealed to this Court in respect of three classes of items.\nThe first class, aggregating $7,287.76, comprises sums of money paid into the Bank of Montreal from time to time by the defendant, or charged to his account by the bank, to pay off the balance due on a promissory note for $13,000, dated June 13, 1906, made in favour of the bank by Sam Brighouse and in which the defendant and the Royal Ice Company joined, either as makers or endorsers, which, it is not clear. This much, however, is beyond dispute, that the $13,000 was placed to the credit of the account of Sam Brighouse in the bank, and that Brighouse drew out the entire amount before the end of June, 1906. On the note Brighouse himself paid $3,000 on October 23, 1906, and a further sum of $3,000 on February 14, 1907. The balance with interest was paid by the defendant in instalments between April 23, 1907, and September 21, 1910; and it is these several instalments, amounting in all, as I have said, to $7,287.76, that the defendant seeks to charge against Brighouse's estate. In my opinion he is entitled to do so. He has shewn that he paid the above amount into Brighouse's account at the bank to square that account. Prima facie, therefore, he paid it for Brighouse, and the onus was on the plaintiff to shew that, notwithstanding this application of the money, the note was in reality a debt that should have been paid by the defendant himself, and not by Brighouse. This, in my opinion, the plaintiff has failed to do. Neither the defendant nor any other witness at the trial could say just what Sam Brighouse did with the $13,000. The defendant suggested that some of it may have been used to erect buildings on Lots 18 and 20, Block 1 D.L. 185, for the Royal Ice Company, a company which Brighouse at that time controlled and whose business he carried on. In 1908 Brighouse gave the property and business of the company to the defendant.\nFor the plaintiff it was contended that it should be held that this $13,000 had been used to erect buildings for the Ice Company or to assist in carrying on the company's actual business operations; and that, as Brighouse gave the business to the defendant before the note was fully paid, the defendant was under an obligation to pay the balance thereof as a liability of the business. In my opinion this contention cannot prevail: In the first place there is no evidence whatever that Brighouse used the money for the business operations of the company, and in the second place, if he used it for the erection of buildings on the above mentioned lots, he knew, when he did so, that these lots were the property of the defendant and had been since 1890. In view of that fact and the relationship existing between them, if the money did go into the buildings, the proper inference to be drawn, under all the circumstances, would be that Brighouse intended the buildings to be a gift to the defendant. As to the suggestion that the $13,000 was a loan to the defendant, all that needs to be said is that there is absolutely no evidence to justify such a conclusion, and the defendant has testified that when Brighouse gave him the business of the Royal Ice Company no obligation was imposed on him to pay off the note in question. The defendant was, therefore, entitled, in the accounting, to charge the $7,287.76 against the estate.\nThe second class consists of a payment of $2,000 made by the defendant to his brother, W. A. Wilkinson, on December 15, 1909, and four payments of $500 each, made in 1911 by the Royal Ice Company to W. A. Wilkinson on the following dates: March 24, April 10, April 28, and May 12. The defendant claims that all these sums were paid as wages due to his brother from Sam Brighouse; while the plaintiff contends they were moneys belonging to W. A. Wilkinson in the hands of the defendant. The circumstances under which the first sum of $2,000 was paid, were as follows: The defendant and his brother jointly owned lands known as the Gulf lots. These lands they sold under an agreement of sale on November 29, 1909, for $46,400, payable, $500 on the execution of the agreement; $5,500 on December 15, 1909; $8,400 on November 29, 1910, and $8,000 on November 29 in each of the following four years, with interest at 6%. The $500 and the $5,500 were paid, and the defendant endorsed on the agreement, under date of December 14, 1909, the receipt of this $6,000, and also the payment thereout of a commission of $2,000. On December 15 he deposited the balance ($4,000) to his credit in the bank and, on the same day, issued a cheque to his brother for $2,000, the exact amount of his brother's share of the purchase money then in the defendant's hands. As the defendant had, just before issuing the cheque to his brother, deposited in his own account in the bank $2,000 belonging to his brother, it is important to note the reason he gives for issuing the cheque on account of wages rather than as a payment of purchase money. His explanation is that his brother had worked for Sam Brighouse from 1896, a period of thirteen years, and had received therefor \"only a few dollars here and there\"; that Sam Brighouse had told him many times to pay his brother \"as soon as he could give him anything\"; that his brother had been pressing him the whole time for payment and that when he got the money from the Gulf lots he was in a position to pay him. His testimony on this point is as follows:\u2014\nQ. Now, let us clear up the facts. It was because you had received money from the sale of the Gulf lots on the 15th of December that put you in funds to enable you to pay your brother $2,000?\nA. Exactly.\nThe whole tenor of his evidence was calculated to lead the court to the conclusion that Sam Brighouse recognized an obligation on his part to pay wages to W. A. Wilkinson; that he did not have the money to pay him and that he requested the defendant to pay these wages as soon as he could collect sufficient to do so. Sam Brighouse was a very wealthy man, which is attested by the fact that he left an estate of $700,000. Had he been under an obligation to pay wages to W. A. Wilkinson, it seems highly improbable that he would not have made a payment on account in the ten years from 1896 to 1906 that W. A. Wilkinson lived with him, and prior to the time when the defendant took over the management of Brighouse's business. The fact is that the mother of the defendant and W. A. Wilkinson was a sister of Sam Brighouse, and went to live with him at the ranch on Lulu Island in 1896, and she and her boys continued to live there until Brighouse's death. There was absolutely no evidence of any agreement on the part of Brighouse to pay wages to W. A. Wilkinson, or any evidence that W. A. Wilkinson had ever asked him for wages. It is not, in my opinion, unworthy of note that although the defendant was receiving considerable sums of money on Brighouse's account from time to time, including $1,515 on November 19, and $2,500 on December 11, 1909, he did not pay anything to his brother until he had on hand money to which his brother was entitled, and then paid him the exact sum due.\nThen as to the four $500 payments in 1911, made also, the defendant claims, for wages: These sums were paid by the Royal Ice Company and charged to the defendant's account. The defendant was asked if, on March 24, 1911, when the Royal Ice Company paid the first $500 to his brother, he (defendant) had received the payment of $8,400 due November 29, 1910, under the agreement of sale. His answer was \"I don't know I am not sure of that.\" Then he gave this testimony :\nQ. *** It is true, is it not, that at the time you paid your brother these four items of $500 you had received moneys from the sale of the Gulf lots, out of which your brother would be entitled to more than $2,000.?\nA. Not at that time he would not be entitled to it from the Gulf lots.\nQ. You received $5,500 on the 15th December, 1909?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And you received $8,400 in November, 1910?\nA. I don't know whether I received the second one at that time, Mr. Craig.\nNow if the defendant did not know whether or not he had received the $8,400 payment before directing the Ice Company to make these $500 payments to his brother, he was scarcely in a position to state, as he did, that when the payments were made his brother was not entitled to them out of the moneys from the Gulf lots. The defendant did know, however, that he had received a part, at least, of the $8,400 due November 29, 1910, for, on December 20, 1910, he made a deposit in the bank of $2,674, and the deposit slip shews that $2,424 of this amount came from one Wakely, and $250 from one Esmond. In reference to the deposit slip he was asked : Q. *** Take the next item, 45, Mr. Brighouse, marked \"Wakely\" and the item 46 marked \"Esmond\"?\nA. That is part of the same payment for the sale of the Gulf lots.\nSo that when the first $500 was paid to his brother by the Ice Company the defendant had on hand over $1,300 of his brother's money, apart altogether from the moneys received in 1909.\nBefore the Registrar the defendant was asked :\nQ. Why should the Royal Ice Company pay him $2,000?\nA. It was out of my account at the Royal Ice Company. I was charged with it. I put the money from the Royal Ice Company into a mortgage in his name.\nFrom this answer it appears that these payments, for whatever purpose they were made, came back to the defendant for investment on his brother's account. At a later stage of the examination the defendant testified that he put the money which he and his brother received from the Gulf lots into the Royal Mansions Apartment Block. These apartments were erected by the defendant in 1912, at a cost of over $80,000, on land of which Sam Brighouse was the registered owner, but which the defendant stated Brighouse had verbally given to him. After Brighouse's death, by a judgment of the courts of British Columbia, the Royal Mansions were adjudged to form part of Brighouse's estate and the defendant and his brother were each given a mortgage thereon of $25,000, evidently for the reason that the defendant had established that he had put into the block $50,000 that did not belong to Sam Brighouse, and that such a sum had been received by himself and his brother from the sale of the Gulf lots. It was argued that the fact that the defendant's brother received a mortgage in his own name for $25,000 corroborated the defendant's statement that none of the $4,000 paid to W. A. Wilkinson could have been paid on account of the purchase money of the Gulf lots, otherwise he would have been overpaid. The fact that W. A. Wilkinson obtained a mortgage for $25,000 must be considered in the light of the further fact that he never had a dollar invested in the Gulf lots. Brighouse bought these lots under an agreement of sale and afterwards turned the agreement over to the defendant who obtained title and then made his brother a gift of a half interest. The defendant's conduct towards his brother, in reference to the Gulf lots and also to the Royal Mansions Apartments, would really indicate that he was making pro- vision for him. He gave him his entire interest in the lots and, with regard to the Royal Mansions he, in one place, gave the following evidence:\nQ. But the Royal Mansions\u2014you considered you owned the Royal Mansions?\nA. No, no, he had a half interest in it.\nIn another place he says:\nNow in making the deal in putting up the Royal Mansions, I split even with him.\nFrom these answers I take it that had it been adjudged that the Royal Mansions belonged to the defendant, his brother would have had a half interest therein. When it was adjudged to belong to the estate and the only interest the defendant had therein was the money he could shew he had put into the block, other than the money of Sam Brighouse, it was to his interest to make this sum as large as possible. Under these circumstances the fact that W. A. Wilkinson got a mortgage on the Royal Mansions of $25,000 is not, in my opinion, corroborative of defendant's statement that had the $4,000 not been paid as wages he would have deducted it from his brother's mortgage. His brother's whole interest in the Royal Mansions was a gift from the defendant and the inference to be drawn from the dealings between them is not that which might be drawn from transactions between strangers carried out in accordance with business principles.\nSection 11 of the Evidence Act of British Columbia reads:\n11. In any action or proceeding by or against the heirs, executors, administrators, or assigns of a deceased person, an opposite or interested party to the action shall not obtain a verdict, judgment, or decision therein, on his own evidence, in respect of any matter occurring before the death of the deceased person, unless such evidence is corroborated by some other material evidence.\nIn the evidence before us I am unable to find any corroboration of the defendant's statement that Sam Brighouse told him to pay his brother wages, or that the $4,000 was paid as wages. An agreement to pay will not, as between near relatives living together, be implied from the fact that service is rendered by one to another. In my opinion, therefore, the defendant is not entitled to charge against the estate the items of this class.\nThe third class comprises two items, one for $992.80 and the other for $668.30, charged against the defendant in the surcharge. These items appear as credits in the defendant's bank book, and the defendant is now unable to say whether they are trust funds or his own money. He kept the trust funds and his own money in one bank account. The plaintiff relies upon the rule that where a trustee mixes trust funds with his own, whether in his account at the bank or elsewhere, the cestui que trust has a claim to have it restored out of the mixed fund in priority to any right of the trustee to the fund, and can claim the whole fund, if the amount which is trust money cannot be ascertained. Generally speaking, therefore, a trustee mixes trust funds with his own at his peril. It is, however, justifiable if done with the consent of the cestui que trust, and that is the ground upon which the defendant justifies his action. He says that on more than one occasion Sam Brighouse told him to use his (Brighouse's) money as his own and not to keep any account of it as that was not necessary. If Sam Brighouse made these statements to the defendant the mixing of the defendant's money with the trust money was with the consent and acquiescence of Brighouse, in which case the plaintiff would not be entitled to succeed in respect of these two items, for they have not been proved to be trust funds and it is established law that a cestui que trust who actively concurs, or passively acquiesces, in a breach of trust can obtain no relief against the trustees in respect of it if, at the time of this concurrence or acquiescence, he was of full age and sui juris and had full knowledge of the circumstances. A person claiming under a cestui que trust stands in the same position as the cestui que trust himself. (Fletcher v. Collis[8] ).\nThe important question therefore is: Did Sam Brighouse acquiesce in the defendant's keeping the trust funds in his own bank account? To corroborate his statement that he did, the defendant called a number of witnesses. R. M. Currie testified that in November, 1908, Sam Brighouse had stated to him that \"everything he had was Michael's (defendant's) to use and do with as he liked, that he (defendant) had kept the estate together and it was his.\" W. R. Burdes testified that Brighouse had great confidence in the defendant and spoke of the property as \"ours\" and said that \"Michael had authority to do what he liked.\" J. H. Cocking, another witness, testified to a conversation he had with Sam Brighouse when he took him to the hospital. He says that on that occasion Brighouse told him that everything he had was Michael's and \"that Michael could use anything he had as though it were his own.\"\nThe evidence of these witnesses, in my opinion, corroborates the testimony of the defendant and justifies its acceptance. As against the defendant, therefore, the rule as to mixing trust moneys with the trustee's own money has no application. The defendant cannot, therefore, be called upon to account for these two sums.\nI would allow the appeal as to classes one and three, and dismiss it as to class two.

M., by mortgage under seal and registered, mortgaged land in the province of Alberta to plaintiff, and subsequently, by transfer, not under seal, made pursuant to the Alberta Land Titles Act, and registered, transferred the land to B., who thereby became liable to plaintiff, under the covenant implied by virtue of s. 54 (1) of said Act, to pay the mortgage money. More than six years (the period of limitation applicable to a simple contract debt) but less than 12 years after registration of the transfer or any payment on account or written acknowledgment of liability by B., the plaintiff sued B. in Alberta for payment.\nHeld (reversing judgment of the Appellate Division, Alta., 23 Alta. L.R. 565) that B.'s liability to plaintiff was not statute barred. The period of limitation in Alberta for bringing action to recover money secured by mortgage made under the Alberta Land Titles Act is 12 years. (Limitation of Action Act, R.S.A. 1922, c. 90, s. 3; Real Property Limitation Act, 1874 (Imp.), c. 57, s. 8; and other statutes, considered); and that was the period applicable to the implied covenant in question.\nPer Duff, Newcombe, Rinfret and Smith JJ.: The covenant implied under s. 54 is, not a simple contract, but a covenant in its ordinary and primary sense, that is, an agreement under seal.\nPer Lamont J.: Whether or not the implied covenant is a covenant in the sense of an agreement under seal, in view of the language in which it is couched (in s. 54) the transferee's liability upon it is co-extensive with the mortgagor's liability on the mortgage; and an action thereon may be brought within the same period of limitation as applies to the mortgagor's Liability.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta [1] holding that the liability in question of the respondent to the appellant was statute barred. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgments now reported, and are indicated in the above head-note. The matter came before the Supreme Court of Alberta by way of stated case, which was referred by Walsh J. to the Appellate Division. The stated case is set out in full in the judgment of Smith J. The appeal was allowed with costs.\nM. M. Porter for the appellant.\nA. Macleod Sinclair, K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Duff, Necombe, Rinfret and Smith J. J. was delivered by\nSMITH J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta (1) in a case stated upon consent by the Trial Division. The stated case is as follows:\n\" 1. By an Instrument of Transfer in writing, made pursuant to the provisions of the Land Titles Act and Amendments thereto, not under seal, executed by the Defendant, George Henry McLeod, dated the 24th day of November, 1917, and registered in the Land Titles Office for the South Alberta Land Registration District on the 23rd day of January, 1918, as No. 522 C.A., the Defendant, William Buxton, the transferee therein named, became the registered owner of the following lands situate in the Province of Alberta, and being composed of the East Half of Section Fourteen (14), in Township eleven (11), Range Twenty-two (22), West of the Fourth (4th) Meridian, containing 320 acres more or less, reserving unto the Crown all mines and minerals.\n2. At the time of registration of said transfer the said lands were subject to a mortgage in favour of the Plaintiff, duly executed under seal by the Defendant, George Henry McLeod, dated the 3rd day of April, 1917, and duly registered on the 17th day of April, 1917, as No. 2546 B.S.\n3. The Defendant, William Buxton, does not deny but admits that by virtue of the registration of said transfer he became liable to the Plaintiff under and by virtue of the provisions of Sections 54 and 55 of the said Land Titles Act.\n4. A period of over six years has elapsed since the date of registration of said transfer and since the date of any payment on account or of any written acknowledgment of the said liability by the said Defendant, William Buxton.\nQuestion for the Consideration of the Court:\nWas the said liability of the Defendant, William Buxton, statute barred at the time of the commencement of this action, i.e., the 31st day of January, 1928?\nThe Plaintiff and the Defendant, William Buxton, hereby agree to the submission of the Special case, as above stated, to a Judge of the Supreme Court of Alberta, subject to the usual right of appeal, or of a reference to the Appellate Division, given by the Rules of the Supreme Court, and further agree that if the question of law hereby submitted is answered in the affirmative the action of the Plaintiff shall be dismissed with costs, and in the event that the said question shall be answered in the negative, Judgment shall be given against the Defendant, William Buxton, for the amount of the Plaintiff's claim with interest and costs, including the costs of and incidental to the disposition of this special case.\nCosts in either case to be taxed on column 4 of Schedule C of the Tariff of Costs.\nDATED at the City of Calgary, in the Province of Alberta, this 13th day of September, 1928.\" Section 54 of the Land Titles Act provides as follows:\n54. (1) In every instrument transferring land, for which a certificate of title has been granted, subject to Mortgage or encumbrance, there shall be implied the following covenant by the transferee both with the transferor and the mortgagee, that is to say: That the Transferee will pay the principal money, interest, annuity or rent charge secured by the mortgage or encumbrance, after the rate and at the time specified in the instrument creating the same, and will indemnify and keep harmless the Transferor from and against the principal sum or other moneys secured by such instrument and from and against the liability in respect of any of the covenants therein contained or under this Act implied, on the part of the transferor.\nThe word \"covenant\" in English law, in its ordinary and primary signification, means an agreement or promise under seal. Wharton's Law Lexicon, 11th ed., 240; Stroud's Judicial Dictionary, 168. It may, like many other words, by reason of circumstances or context have a different meaning in particular instances, but I am unable to discover any ground for supposing that in the section quoted above the Legislature intended to use the word otherwise than in its ordinary and primary sense. On the contrary, I should think it remarkable if it was used with the intention that it should be given any other meaning. If the intention was that only a simple contract was to be implied, there was no difficulty about using a word that would make that intention absolutely clear, such as \"agreement\". The use of the technical word \"covenant\", in dealing with conveyancing, indicates, in my opinion, that the deliberate intention was to provide for a real covenant; that is, an agreement under seal, the equivalent of what would be used in such a transaction in ordinary conveyancing if there were no such Act.\nWe are therefore to imply by the express words of s. 54 that the transferee Buxton, by the transfer in question, entered into a covenant, that is, an agreement under seal, with both the transferor and the mortgagee, in the terms set out in the section.\nI agree with my brother Lamont, for the reasons stated by him, that the period of limitation in Alberta for bringing an action to recover money secured by mortgage in statutory form is twelve years, and it may follow, as he holds, that the same period applies to an action on the covenant to be implied under s. 54, even if it be regarded as a simple contract. Whether this be so or not, I think it clear that the period of limitation under the implied covenant is twelve years for the reasons I have stated.\nThe appeal is allowed with costs here and below.\nThe question submitted is answered in the negative, and there will be judgment against the (defendant) respondent, as provided in the stated case.\nLAMONT J.\u2014This is an appeal from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[2]. The facts are all admitted and are as follows:\u2014\nPrior to November 24, 1917, the defendant McLeod was the registered owner of the E. \u00bd 14 \u2014 11 \u2014 22 \u2014 W. 4. That land was subject to a mortgage in favour of the appellant company made by McLeod, on April 3rd, 1917, and duly registered during that month. On November 24th, 1917, McLeod executed a transfer of the land, subject to the mortgage, to the respondent Buxton, which transfer was registered January 18, 1918. That transfer was not under seal. After the registration of the transfer a period of more than six years elapsed without any payment by Buxton on account of the mortgage, or any written acknowledgment of any liability on his part thereunder.\nOn January 31, 1928, the appellant brought action to compel payment of the mortgage by Buxton by virtue of the implied covenant contained in s. 54 of the Land Titles Act. Buxton claimed that the liability imposed on him by that section was merely a simple contract debt and that it was statute barred when the action was brought. There being no dispute as to the facts, a stated case was agreed upon and the following question was submitted to the court:\nWas the liability of Buxton statute barred at the time of the commencement of this action, i.e. 31st day of January, 1928?\nThe Appellate Division, applying its own previous decision in Societe Beige D'Enterprises Industrielles et Immobilieres v. Webster and Mill[3], answered the question in the affirmative. From that decision this appeal is brought. The relevant sections of the Land Titles Act are sections 50, 54 and 55.\n50. After a certificate of title has been granted for any land, no instrument shall be effectual to pass any estate or interest in such land (except a leasehold interest for three years or for a less period) or render such land liable as security for the payment of money, unless such instrument is executed in accordance with the provisions of this Act and is duly registered thereunder; but upon the registration of any such instrument in the manner hereinbefore prescribed the estate or interest specified therein shall pass, or, as the case may be, the land shall become liable as security in manner and subject to the covenants, conditions and contingencies set forth and specified in such instrument or by this Act declared to be implied in instruments of a like nature.\n54. (1) In every instrument transferring land, for which a certificate of title has been granted, subject to mortgage or incumbrance, there shall be implied the following covenant by the transferee both with the transferor and the mortgagee, that is to say: That the transferee will pay the principal money, interest, annuity or rent charge secured by the mortgage or incumbrance, after the rate and at the time specified in the instrument creating the same, and will indemnify and keep harmless the transferor from and against the principal sum or other moneys secured by such instrument and from and against the liability in respect of any of the covenants therein contained or under this Act implied, on the part of the transferor.\n55. Every covenant and power declared to be implied in any instrument by virtue of this Act may be negatived or modified by express declaration in the instrument; and in any action for a supposed breach of any such covenant the covenant alleged to be broken may be set forth and it shall be lawful to allege that the party against whom the action is brought did so covenant, precisely in the same manner as if the covenant had been expressed in words in the transfer or other instrument, any law or practice to the contrary notwithstanding; and every such implied covenant shall have the same force and effect and be enforced in the same manner as if it had been set out at length in the transfer or other instrument.\nFor the appellant it was contended that, as the obligation of the transferee was, in s. 54, stated to be a \"covenant\", the employment of that word indicated a legislative intention that the liability of the transferee should be the same as though the covenant were under seal.\nIn the view I take of the case it is not necessary to determine this question, for I find in the obligation which s. 54 expressly imposes, and in the statutory enactments relating to limitation of actions, sufficient to enable me to answer the question submitted to the court.\nThe obligation imposed upon Buxton by the implied covenant is that he will pay the principal money and interest secured by the mortgage and will indemnify and keep harmless the transferor from and against his obligations under the mortgage. This means that Buxton must idemnify McLeod and keep him harmless from any payments which McLeod, as mortgagor, may be called upon to make by reason of his covenants in the mortgage.\nIn view of the language in which the covenant is couched, Buxton's obligation to indemnify McLeod must be held to be co-extensive with McLeod's obligation to pay. The argument advanced in the respondent's factum that even if the mortgage debt be a specialty, Buxton's liability was only a simple contract debt, seems to me so inconsistent with the plain language of the covenant as not to merit serious consideration. When the mortgagor's liability in respect of the mortgage is at an end the transferee's liability will cease. The important question, therefore, is: Within what period can an action be brought to enforce a mortgage debt in the Province of Alberta?\nBefore September 1, 1905, the territory now forming the Province of Alberta was part of the North West Territories. By s. 3 of c. 25 of the Statutes of 1886, the Parliament of Canada enacted that the laws of England relating to civil and criminal matters, as the same existed on the 15th day of July, 1870, shall be in force in the Territories in so far as the same are applicable and in so far as the same have not been, or may not hereafter be, repealed or modified. In the same year Parliament enacted the Territories Real Property Act, which introduced into the Territories the Torrens System of registration of land titles, which, with some slight variations, became the Land Titles Act of Alberta, after the creation of that province.\nAmong the laws of England in force on July 15, 1870, were those relating to limitation of actions.\nBy 21 Jac. I., cap. 16, all actions arising out of simple contracts or torts had to be brought within six years after the cause of action arose.\nBy 3 and 4 Wm. IV., cap. 42, s. 3 (Imp.) (1833) it was enacted that the time within which actions upon specialties must be brought was twenty years after the cause of action arose.\nBy 3 and 4 Wm. IV., cap. 27, the time within which an action could be brought to recover any sum of money secured by any mortgage, or otherwise charged upon or payable out of land, was fixed at twenty years.\nThese were the periods of limitation according to English law in force on July 15th, 1870, which were introduced into the Territories.\nIn 1874, however, another alteration was made. The Real Property Limitation Act, 1874 (Imp.), cap. 57, s. 8, enacted as follows:\u2014\nNo action or suit or other proceeding shall be brought to recover any sum of money secured by any mortgage, judgment, or lien, or otherwise charged upon or payable out of any land or rent, at law or in equity, or any legacy, but within twelve years next after a present right to receive the same shall have accrued to some person capable of giving a discharge for or release of the same, unless in the meantime some part of the principal money, or some interest thereon, shall have been paid, or some acknowledgment of the right thereto shall have been given in writing signed by the person by whom the same shall be payable * * *.\nBy an ordinance (No. 28 of 1893) the Legislative Assembly of the North West Territories declared the provisions of the Imperial Act of 1874 to be in force in the Territories. In 1905 the Province of Alberta was carved out of the North West Territories and the laws of the Territories were made applicable thereto, until repealed or altered by the Alberta Legislature. By c. 24 of 1906 the provincial legislature enacted the Land Titles Act under which a mortgage, to become a security on land, must be in the form prescribed by the Act and duly registered. Then in 1922 the Legislature enacted the Limitation of Action Act (R.S.A. 1922, c. 90), sections 2 and 3 of which are as follows:\u2014\n2. All actions for recovery of merchants' accounts, bills, notes, and all actions of debt grounded upon any lending or other contract without specialty shall be commenced within six years after the cause of such action arose and not afterwards.\n3. The provisions of The Real Property Limitation Act) 1874, being chapter 57 of the Statutes of the Imperial Parliament, passed in the thirty-seventh and thirty-eighth years of Her Majesty's reign, are hereby declared to be in force in the Province and shall be deemed to have been in force in the Province and in the North-West Territories since the passing thereof.\nBy s. 3, above quoted the legislature, by reference, enacted that no action shall be brought to recover any sum of money, secured by any mortgage or otherwise charged upon or payable out of land, but within twelve years from the time the cause of action arose. The only mortgages in Alberta to which that provision could be applied were those provided for in the Land Titles Act. By no other means could money be secured by mortgage on Alberta lands. The legislature, therefore, in enacting the section must have contemplated its application, so far as actions on mortgages are concerned, to the statutory mortgage of the Land Titles Act. The legislature, having jurisdiction to fix the period within which a mortgage debt shall become statute barred and having fixed it at twelve years, reference to other considerations is rendered unnecessary. As an action on the mortgage in question may be brought against the mortgagor, McLeod, within twelve years from payment or acknowledgment in writing, an action, in my opinion, may be brought on the implied covenant in s. 54 within the same time.\nI would allow the appeal with costs; set aside the judgment below, and enter judgment for the plaintiff, with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\n[1] 23 Alta.

Fletcher (1), were entitled to invoke that doctrine with respect to the fire, which started, as the trial judge had found, from the application of the blow torch, it was not disputed, and, of course, could not be disputed, that they must fail if these two propositions of fact were determined against them: (1) that the fire started in the afternoon and originated in some act of Ferguson, and (2) that the act of Ferguson was the unauthorized act of a third person; and the Court had no manner of doubt that Ferguson's acts in the afternoon were the acts of an unauthorized person, and agreed with the majority of the Court of Appeal that the most natural conclusion from all the evidence was that the fire must have occurred as the result of the sawdust being ignited on the occasion of Ferguson's visit to the cellar in the afternoon.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nChas.

The platform was provided and maintained and kept in repair by the city. Plaintiff claimed damages against the defendant street railway company.\nHeld, reversing judgment of the Manitoba Court of Appeal, 37 Man. R. 412, that defendant was not liable. It could not be said that defendant owed a duty to plaintiff to see that the platform was maintained \u201cat a safe distance from the rail,\u201d or \u201cto take care that it could be used in safety by the persons who went upon it\u201d waiting for and entering defendant\u2019s cars. The platform was one of the appurtenances of the public street. It was, as such, under the care of the municipality, and persons using it, as a stopping place while crossing the street, or for waiting for a street car or other public conveyance, were doing so under such guarantees of safety as the municipal control and the duties incident to that control might provide. In no pertinent sense could it be said that such persons used the platform \u201cat the invitation of the defendant.\u201d The fact that defendant made the platform one of its stopping places involved no assurance by it that the municipality had discharged its duty in respect of maintenance and repair.\nAPPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1] dismissing its appeal from the judgment of Kilgour J.[2] who held that the plaintiff was entitled to recover damages against the defendant for personal injuries sustained by her when the platform or \u201cisland\u201d stationed beside the defendant\u2019s street car track on the corner of Jarvis Avenue and Main Street in the City of Winnipeg, on which she was standing in order to board an approaching street car of the defendant, was struck by the step (which had not been let down and was in its closed or vertical position) of the said street car, causing the plaintiff to be thrown off her feet and injured. The platform was provided and maintained and kept in repair by the City of Winnipeg.\nThe appeal was allowed with costs.\nW. N. Tilley K.C. for the appellant.\nS. Abrahamson for the respondent.\nThe Court.\u2014We have come to the conclusion that appeal should be allowed. The Court of Appeal rightly treated the question of onus of proof as of no importance. The respondent, no doubt, established a prima facie case; but the Court of Appeal rightly considered that, on the facts in evidence, the motorman could not be held ta be chargeable with negligence and that the car was of normal dimensions. The grounds upon which that court proceeded appear from the judgments of Dennistoiun and Trueman, JJ.A., in these passages. Mr. Justice Dennistoun says:\u2014\nI think there was negligence on the part of the defendant company in permitting the platform to occupy a position on the highway for a considerable time, with only one-half inch of lateral clearance. It should have been realized by the company that a very slight movement of the platform would bring it into collision with a passing car. It is well known to judges of this Court that these platforms are frequently collided with by motor cars. That being so the company should have taken precautions to see that the platform in question was placed by the city, or their own workmen, at a safe distance from the rail.\nThe same learned judge also agrees with the reasons of Trueman, J.A., who expresses this view:\u2014\nThe defendant having knowledge that the platform was in the way and likely to be displaced by motor traffic, it plainly was its duty to take care that it could be used in safety by the persons who went upon it by its invitation.\nThe substantial controversy on the appeal concerns the question whether the appellant company did owe a duty to the respondent to see that the platform was maintained \u201cat a safe distance from the rail\u201d as Dennistoun, J.A., puts it; or, as Trueman, J.A., puts it, \u201cto take care that it could be used in safety by the persons who went upon it\u201d waiting for and entering the company\u2019s cars. Dennistoun, J.A., it will be perceived, states the rule in narrower terms than those employed by Trueman, J.A.; but, with great respect, we are not aware of any basis of legal principle upon which the rule, stated in either form, can stand.\nThe platform was one of the appurtenances of the public street; it was, as such, under the care of the municipality, and persons making use of it, as a stopping place while crossing the street, or for entering an auto bus or a street car, were doing so under such guarantees of safety as the municipal control and the duties incident to that control might provide. Persons waiting for a street car or other public conveyance made use of it just as in other circumstances they would have used a sidewalk or pavement.\nIt seems impossible to hold that in any pertinent sense such persons used the platform \u201cat the invitation of the company.\u201d The fact that the company, whether under compulsion of municipal by-law or without any such compulsion, made the platform one of its stopping places, involved no assurance by it that the municipality had discharged its duty in respect of maintenance and repair. It might with equal force be affirmed that such an assurance is implied in the fact that at street corners and other convenient places, the company sets up marks showing where its cars are brought to a stop in order to receive or discharge passengers.\nThe appeal involves no question as to the responsibility of the company in respect of the safe carriage of its passengers. That responsibility, no doubt, is in full force when the passenger is actually being received, as such, upon a car. But its responsibility for the safe carriage of its passengers is not susceptible of being enlarged to the indefinite extent required to make it applicable to a person standing on a street, waiting for a ear which has not yet come to a stop.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the Court of Appeal, and the action dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Anderson, Guy, Chappell & Turner.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Abrahamson & Greenberg.\n[1] 37 Man.

On October 29, 1927 (a Saturday evening), the lessee, stating his intention to purchase (without reference to terms for the balance), tendered $15,000 (accompanied by a letter) as being the first payment under the option, which was not accepted, the lessor (respondent) requiring terms that the balance be \"practically cash\" or be placed in escrow in the bank pending delivery of title. On October 31 (Monday) the lessee had decided to pay the whole price in cash, but could not find the lessor who was out of town, and, on his return, notified him on November 3 that $45,000 was on deposit in a certain bank and would be paid out in accordance with the terms required. The offer was refused, and the lessee claimed damages for breach of contract.\nHeld (affirming judgment of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia, 40 B.C. Rep. 403), Newcombe J. dissenting, that the lessee could not succeed. By the option terms the balance of the price was left to be determined by a further understanding between the parties, which did not take place; the lessor's terms not having been accepted on October 29, there was no enforceable agreement; acceptance on November 3 was too late.\nPer Newcombe J., dissenting: The expression \"balance to be arranged,\" having regard to the context, was unilateral, and intended only to evidence an obligation of the purchaser, the word \" arranged \" having the sense of \" provided.\" To convert the option into a contract of sale it was not necessary for the lessee (purchaser) to do more than he did. It involved him in the obligation to provide $30,000 more, to be paid when the lessor (vendor) made out his title; and the passing of the conveyance and payment of said balance should, in ordinary course, take place simultaneously. The lessee had fortified himself with the money; in other words, he had \" arranged \" the balance, and it would have been paid but for the lessor's default in rejecting the tender and ignoring the contract.\nAPPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] which, reversing the judgment of Morrison J.[2], dismissed his counterclaim for damages for alleged breach of contract in not carrying out the sale of certain hotel premises in accordance with a certain alleged exercised option to purchase contained in a lease. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgments now reported. The appeal was dismissed with costs, Newcombe J. dissenting.\nJ. W. de B. Farris K.C. for the appellant.\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. and W. F. Hansford for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Duff, Mignault, Lamont and Smith JJ.) was delivered by\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014On the 30th of October, 1926, the parties entered into a contract of lease for one year from the 1st of November, 1926, of an hotel known as the King Edward Hotel in Revelstoke, B.C. The contract gave to the lessee (the appellant) an option to purchase the hotel which reads as follows:\u2014\nAnd the said lessors hereby give to the said lessee the first option to purchase the said lands, premises, furniture and equipment for a period of one year from the date hereof at a price of $45,000 with a cash payment of $15,000 and balance to be arranged.\nThe present litigation has arisen over an attempt of the appellant to exercise the option granted by this clause, and the whole difficulty is occasioned by the words \"balance to be arranged\" in the option. It was apparently not intended that more than $15,000 should be paid in cash, and there had to be a further agreement between the parties as to the terms of payment of the balance of the purchase price.\nThe appellant waited until the year was nearly completed before taking any steps to exercise the option. He had every reason to expect trouble because, on September 17, 1927, the respondent McSorley gave him a written notice that he had sold to the other respondent, Prince Edward Hotels, Limited, the land and premises, furniture and equipment of the King Edward Hotel at Revelstoke. McSorley had previously asked Murphy to release him on the option, which the latter refused to do. About three months before the end of the year McSorley had asked him what he was going to do, and Murphy replied: \"If you tell me what your terms are, I will tell you right now what I can do.\" McSorley's answer was that the terms would have to be practically cash.\nFinally Murphy placed the matter in the hands of a Mr. A. M. Grimmett, a solicitor of Revelstoke. Mr. Grimmett had an interview with McSorley on October 28, 1927, and the latter stated that the terms would be $15,000 cash and the balance placed in escrow pending delivery of title. Mr. Grimmett says:\nI told him that Mr. Murphy did not consider those terms satisfactory; however, would pay him $40,000 cash if, in consideration for giving the cash, Mr. McSorley would throw off $5,000. Mr. McSorley said, \"No,\" that he was definite in his terms, and it would have to be $15,000 cash and the balance placed in the bank in escrow pending delivery of title. We had further discussion as to the advisability of such terms, but Mr. McSorley would not deviate, and I told him that I would place the proposition before Mr. Murphy.\nOn October 29, a Saturday, during the evening, Mr. Grimmett and Murphy met McSorley by appointment. What ensued may be stated in the words of Mr. Grimmett:\nOn the 29th of October I went, in company with Mr. Murphy, to the King Edward Hotel, an appointment having been made with Mr. McSorley for eight o'clock. I waited in the lobby until approximately 8.10, when Mr. McSorley was free, and the three of us went into the ladies' parlour, and Mr. Murphy took a certified cheque, which he had attached to a letter, and offered it to Mr. McSorley, saying \"This is the first payment under the terms of the option.\" Mr. McSorley said, \"I won't accept it.\" He said, \"You know my terms. It has to be practically cash,\"\u2014or, \"you know my terms, the balance to be placed in escrow in the bank.\" Mr. McSorley then said: \"I want to know what Mr. Murphy intends to do.\" Mr. Murphy said, \"I tender you the $15,000 in accordance with the terms of the option and intend to purchase the hotel.\" Mr. McSorley refused it, and there was nothing said for a few moments. Then I said, \"Well, I guess that is all we can do.\" And another silence for a few moments; I repeated what I said, then got up, and we left.\nThe letter to which Mr. Grimmett refers reads as follows: REVELSTOKE, B.C.,\nH. J. McSorley and\nOctober 29, 1927.\nKing Edward Hotel Ltd.,\nRevelstoke, B.C.\nDear Sir:\nI herewith tender to you the sum of fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000), by certified cheque, being the first payment under the terms of a certain option to purchase, made between Henry Joseph McSorley and the King Edward Hotel Limited of the one part and Patrick Henry Murphy, of the other part, bearing date the 30th day of October, A.D. 1926.\nYours truly,\nP. H. MURPHY.\nIt appears from the above that the parties separated on the evening of October 29, without having agreed upon the terms of payment of the balance of the purchase price. The next day, Sunday the 30th, was the last day of the year mentioned in the option. On Monday, the 31st October, Murphy had decided to pay the whole purchase price in cash. But he could not find McSorley, who had gone to Vancouver. When the latter returned, Mr. Grimmett notified him, on November 3, that\nthe sum of $45,000 is now on deposit in the Imperial Bank of Canada at Revelstoke, B.C., and will be paid out to you or the King Edward Hotel Limited in accordance with the terms set out by you on the 29th of October.\nMcSorley refused to accept this offer, and as Murphy had remained in possession of the hotel after the expiration of the year, he took proceedings with Prince Edward Hotels Limited, to have him ejected. To this action Murphy counterclaimed demanding specific performance of the agreement of sale. The issue under the counterclaim is now reduced to a claim of damages for breach of contract, for Murphy was unable to tie up so large a sum as $45,000 during the litigation.\nThe learned trial judge (Morrison J.) decided the case in favour of Murphy[3]. He said:\nAny difficulty which the incidents of the transaction present arises from the words\u2014\" balance to be arranged,\" which appear in the lease. To my mind, it cannot be that the price of $45,000 having been fixed, and $15,000 to be paid in cash, it was intended the balance should also be in cash, as demanded by the plaintiff. The character of the transaction and the knowledge which it is reasonable to find that the plaintiff had of the defendant's financial capacity repel such submission. So that the true meaning of that clause as to the arrangement for the balance would, in my opinion, come within the cases cited in the judgment of Martin J., in the Townley case[4].\nThe balance was to be arranged impliedly upon a reasonable and fair basis. The attitude taken by the plaintiff was, in my opinion, not reasonable or fair. I find there was no waste or neglect on the defendant's part. For ought it appears the plaintiff could have performed his part of the contract, but he would not do so.\nThis judgment was set aside by the Court of Appeal (Macdonald C.J. and Martin & Galliher JJ.), Mr. Justice Galliher dissenting[5]. The substantial ground of reversal, as stated by the learned Chief Justice was that\nan agreement which leaves one of the essential terms to be determined by the parties mutually at a future time is unenforceable. It was contended that, since an election to purchase was made within the year, respondent was in time when he notified the appellant of his election. There are two answers to that contention, first, the agreement is void ab imitio, and secondly, if that be not a sufficient answer, there was an attempt to arrange the terms, which failed; Godson v. Burns[6]; Bocalter v. Hazle[7].\nWith the learned trial judge, I am of opinion, as I have already stated, that the understanding of the parties, so far as it had progressed at the time of the lease, was not that if Murphy exercised the option, he should pay the whole price in cash. There was to be a down payment of $15,000, and the balance was to be \"arranged,\" that is to say, its mode of payment, no doubt very imprudently, was left to be determined by a further understanding between the parties, for to \"arrange\" something is to come to an agreement in respect of it, to settle or adjust it. Unfortunately for the appellant, this further understanding or meeting of the minds did not take place. It is no answer to say that McSorley's attitude was not \"fair\" or \"reasonable.\" As it takes two to make a bargain, the only way this bargain could have been made would have been by acceptance of McSorley's terms at the interview of October 29. It was too late to accept them on November 3. The court cannot make for the parties a bargain which they themselves did not make in proper time. It follows, with all possible deference for the opinions of the learned trial judge and of Mr. Justice Galliher, that the majority of the Court of Appeal were right when they rejected the appellant's counterclaim for damages.\nThe appeal should therefore be dismissed with costs.\nNEWCOMBE J. (dissenting).\u2014I would have thought that if, within the year to which the option extended, the appellant had exercised his option and tendered to the respondent McSorley the stipulated price, $45,000 in cash, the latter would have been bound; on the contrary, it is the real foundation of the respondents' case that there was no contract, and that, even in the event which I have assumed, McSorley would have been justified to reject the tender and to deny any obligation\u2014an interpretation which denudes the option clause of any effect; but the construction ought to be otherwise if reasonably possible. It is the duty of the Court to find a reasonable intendment when the words are capable of it, and the contract should be construed ut res magis valeat quam pereat.\nNow there is not a word expressed in the contract to indicate that, as has been said, the mode of payment was left to be determined by a further understanding between the parties. I repeat the clause:\nAnd the said lessors hereby give to the said lessee the first option to purchase the said lands, premises, furniture and equipment for a period of one year from the date hereof at a price of $45,000 with a cash payment of $15,000 and balance to be arranged.\nWhat is to be arranged? The balance, that is, $30,000. Who was to do this? I should think, undoubtedly, the purchaser. The expression \"balance to be arranged,\" having regard to the context in which it stands, is unilateral, and intended only to evidence an obligation of the purchaser. The word \" arrange,\" while it often may import a meaning which requires two parties for the effecting of the arrangement, does not necessarily have that meaning; and, in the sense in which it is here used, when you look for the subject of the verb, expressed, as it is, in its passive form, and you find it to be $30,000, it becomes obvious that it was for the appellant to do the arranging. I would give effect to the word, as we find it, in the sense of \"provided \"; that is an authorized or admissible synonym, and is very frequently used as a convenient equivalent, particularly in business transactions. When a man says, \"I will arrange the funds,\" he means, \"I will provide the funds \"; and, if he says,\" The funds will be arranged, \" in relation to a transaction in which it is implicit that the funds are to come from him, it means nothing but that he will provide the funds.\nThen, upon the assumption that an effective purchase would have been contracted by the tender of the purchase price on 28th October, it is clear that the contract was not, upon its face, utterly inefficient; and it is necessary to inquire further as to what was the vendor's position in the circumstances as they existed. In order to convert the option into a contract for sale, it was necessary, according to the stipulations, for the appellant to do no more than he did. The purchaser attended upon the vendor on the penultimate day of the year and tendered the requisite payment of $15,000 in cash, stating that he intended to purchase the hotel. This involved the purchaser in the obligation to provide $30,000 more, to be paid, of course, when the vendor made out his title; and the passing of the conveyance and the payment of the aforesaid balance should, in ordinary course, take place simultaneously. The appellant had fortified himself with the money. In other words, he had arranged the balance, and it would have been paid but for McSorley's default in rejecting the tender and ignoring the contract and his obligations thereunder.\nUpon this view of the case, I would allow the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Farris, Farris, Stultz & Sloan.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Harper & Sargent.\n[1] 40 B.C.

The fact that the captain of the Glenross, when hearing fog signals from the other ship, changed its course one point to starboard (immediately indicating this by signal), was not, of itself, under the circumstances, a ground of liability against the Glenross.\nAPPEAL by the ship Glenross and by its owners from the judgment of Hodgins J., Local Judge in Admiralty of the Toronto Admiralty District of the Exchequer Court of Canada, holding the ship Glenross solely responsible for the collision in question between it and the respondent ship Glenledi, which occurred on Lake Superior on the morning of June 17, 1926. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was allowed with costs, and the judgment below varied by declaring both ships equally liable for the damages caused by the collision.\nW. Fraser Grant and W. A. Robinson for the appellants.\nFrancis King K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nMignault J.\u2014These two actions, which were consolidated and tried together in the court below, are proceedings in rem against the ship Glenross, in one case, and against the ship Glenledi, in the other, arising out of a collision between the two ships on Lake Superior early in the morning of the 17th of June, 1926. The Local Judge in Admiralty of the Toronto Admiralty District (Mr. Justice Hodgins), found the Glenross solely to blame for the collision and dismissed the action brought against the Glenledi. The Glenross and her owners now appeal in both actions.\nThe Glenross is a steamer of a gross tonnage of 3,219 tons, and measures 343 feet in length. The gross tonnage of the Glenledi is 3,571 tons and its length 391 feet, so that it is the larger vessel of the two. It is also the faster ship, its full speed being 12 miles per hour and that of the Glenross 8\u00bd miles, or a shade better. At the time of the accident, the Glenross was upward bound and the Glenledi downward bound, both being on the stretch, more than 100 miles in length, between Passage Island and Whitefish Point, and the place of collision was between 27 and 28 miles from the latter point. Both ships were fully laden.\nThe weather was heavy with rain, and the wind was from the southeast. Notwithstanding the wide expanse of Lake Superior, neither ship apparently had caught sight of the other, although they were then approaching rapidly, and several hours of daylight had intervened. At about\u20197 a.m. a thick fog set in, and any possibility of seeing passing ships became out of the question, the only way their presence could be detected being by the fog signals which they were required to blow at regular intervals. The Glenledi was steaming on a course S. 60\u00b0 E. by compass, while the Glenross was steering N. 53\u00b0 W., also by compass. They were thus on substantially parallel courses, these courses being in close proximity, and the ships were approaching on the starboard side of each other.\nWhen the fog set in, the captains of both ships were called and came on the bridge. Captain Taylor was master of the Glenledi, and he went into the wheelhouse, or pilot house, in the forepart of the ship, where he remained with the wheelsman, Mahew, while the second mate, Sykes, and the watchman, Gerster, stood outside on the bridge. Captain Taylor placed himself before an open window. Captain Hudson was master of the Glenross, and, with his second mate, Bush, his wheelsman, Bruce, and his watchman, Woods, took his stand in the wheelhouse, the three front windows of which were open, the captain being at the window on the starboard side.\nThe clocks on the two ships did not agree, and this explains the discrepancy in the testimony as to the precise time at which the material events happened. For this reason, and because the marking down of the hour on the Glenledi appears to have been the most accurate, I propose to follow what I may call the respondent\u2019s time-table, which places the collision at 7.24 a.m., the time given by the appellant being 7.28 a.m.\nFog signals (three distinct blasts according to the rules) were at intervals sounded and heard by both ships, the conditions, on account of the direction of the wind, being better for hearing signals on the Glenledi than on the Glenross. To the watchers on the latter ship, the fog signals from the Glenledi appeared to come from straight ahead. For this reason, and after three or four fog signals had been exchanged, Captain Hudson of the Glenross ported his helm one point (11 degrees), thus bringing the ship\u2019s head one point to starboard. He says that he wanted to test the bearing of the other ship, the identity of which he did not know, and after the manoeuvre was effected, the signals were heard one point to port, confirming, the captain states, his impression as to the position and bearing of the oncoming vessel. This change of course of the Glenross, whatever may have been its motive, was much insisted upon by the respondent. It is no doubt a circumstance to be considered, but in itself it does not appear to have been necessarily faulty. A circumstance more material, in view of what happened, is that while the wheelsman on the Glenross was carrying out the manoeuvre of porting one point, Hudson blew one blast on his whistle, and he states that he heard in reply a one-blast signal, appearing much nearer than the previous fog signals from the other ship, but the witnesses from the Glenledi say that this one-blast signal was not given. Hudson also checked his ship to half-speed, about 4\u00bd miles per hour.\nUnder rule 21 of the rules adopted by Order in Council of February 4, 1916, for the navigation of the Great Lakes, one blast, with an exception not material here, means: \u201cI am directing my course to starboard.\u201d And the same rule states that in all weathers every steam vessel under way in taking any course authorized or required by the rules shall indicate that course by the following signals (mentioned in paragraph 2 of rule 21) on her whistle, to be accompanied, whenever required, by corresponding alteration of her helm; and every steam vessel receiving a signal from another shall promptly respond with the same signal or sound the danger signal as provided in rule 22.\nThese signals are known as passing signals, and the testimony on behalf of the Glenross is that this one-blast signal was sounded at the time her course was changed one point to starboard. If this signal was received by the Glenledi, it called for the action on her part required by the rule just mentioned.\nIt will be convenient at this point to see what was being done at that time on the Glenledi. The master, Captain Taylor, had come on the bridge at 7.13 a.m. For some time he heard fog signals from an approaching vessel which turned out to be the Glenross. To those on the Glenledi, these signals sounded one and two points to starboard, and they seemed to broaden out more and more on that side. At 7.20 both the second officer, Sykes, and the watchman, Gerster, reported to Captain Taylor that they thought they had heard a one-blast passing signal from the approaching steamer. Taylor himself admits that he heard something but not distinct. He says he, was in doubt. I think it may be taken that Hudson\u2019s first one-blast signal was sounded at 7.20 a.m., four minutes before the collision, when both ships were hidden by the fog.\nBefore discussing what was Taylor\u2019s duty in these circumstances, it may be mentioned that he testifies that on receiving this report from Sykes and Gerster, he blew a fog signal of three blasts. He denies giving the one-blast signal which the witnesses from the Glenross say they heard in answer to their first passing signal. The learned trial judge suggests that possibly what was heard on the Glenross was one of the blasts of the three-blast fog signal. Hudson states that after his first one-blast signal, and the hearing of the answer, he sounded a second one-blast signal which was heard by the Glenledi Taylor then blew an alarm, and while he was doing so the vessels hove in view, witnesses from the Glenledi say at a distance of about 1,000 feet, witnesses from the Glenross at some 600 or 700 feet from their ship. The collision was then inevitable, and as the Glenross was swinging to starboard\u2014Hudson had put his helm hard to port on receiving an answer to his second one-blast signal\u2014Taylor states that he gave her a one-blast signal so that she might continue her swing and not strike the Glenledi amidships. The vessels came together almost at their bows, each one sustaining a deep wound from the other. The bulkheads, however, held good and the ships were able to continue their journey in safety.\nIt is now important to determine what was the speed of the vessels from the time the fog set in until the collision. When each captain came on the bridge, the ships were travelling at full speed. On giving his first one-blast signal, Hudson checked his engines to half-speed, 4\u00bd miles, and reversed them to full speed astern when he heard the second one-blast signal from the Glenledi. Taylor, on the other hand, says that when he arrived on the bridge at 7.13 he checked his ship to half speed, 7 miles. At 7.17 he first heard the fog signal of the other vessel, and stopped his engines. Fog signals from the Glenross were heard from 7.17 to 7.20, when his second mate and watchman reported that they thought they heard a one-blast signal from the other ship. Taylor then went full speed astern and blew a fog signal. The Glenross at that time was not in sight. I am satisfied that the alarm which Captain Taylor says he sounded was appreciably later than 7.20, when he received the above mentioned report from his second officer and his watchman, for on this report he states that he sounded the usual fog signal.\nThis appears to me as clear an account as it is possible to give of the material events which preceded the collision. The testimony on behalf of the Glenross is confused and the learned trial judge preferred the story of the officers of the Glenledi, which, however, somewhat lacks in definiteness, notably as to the interval of time which intervened between the fog signal which Taylor says he sounded after receiving the report of Sykes and Gerster, and the alarm signal which he subsequently gave. But one salient fact is established beyond any question, to wit, the failure of Captain Taylor, on receiving this report, to sound immediately an alarm, instead of giving the usual fog signal. On this fact it seems possible to base a decision as to the liability of the Glenledi.\nThe first passing signal was undoubtedly given by the Glenross, and I have placed it at 7.20 a.m. The second officer and the watchman of the Glenledi reported to the captain that they thought they heard it and the latter heard something himself, but not distinct. Taylor admits that he was in doubt and that he had \u201cno idea what his (the Glenross\u2019s) heading might be.\u201d\nWhat then was Taylor\u2019s duty under the rules, the signal in question being a passing signal indicating that the other ship was directing her course to starboard, which would bring her across the course of the Glenledi and involve danger of collision?\nIf Taylor was in doubt, as he says, rule 22 imperatively required him to sound immediately the danger signal. This rule is as follows:\nRule 22. If, when steamers are approaching each other, the pilot of either vessel fails to understand the course or intention of the other, whether from signals being given or answered erroneously, or from other causes, the pilot so in doubt shall immediately signify the same by giving the danger signal of five or more short and rapid blasts of the whistle; and if both vessels shall have approached within half a mile of each other, both shall be immediately slowed to a speed barely sufficient for steerage-way, and, if necessary, stopped and reversed, until the proper signals are given, answered, and understood, or until the vessels shall have passed each other. The learned trial judge found the Glenledi in fault under this rule, but he absolved her owners from all liability on the ground that this fault had not caused or contributed to the collision. He came to this conclusion because he believed the evidence on behalf of the Glenledi that at the time of the collision that ship was at a standstill or moving backward.\nIt does not appear to me absolutely clear that the Glenledi was at a standstill or moving backward when the ships came together. Taylor does not say that his ship was travelling backward. I quote from his testimony:\nBy His Lordship;\nQ. You were backing full speed?\nA. Yes, sir.\nQ. You mean your vessel was travelling backward?\nA. No, sir. I mean the engines were going full speed astern. By Mr. King:\nQ. Can you tell us at that time about how much speed you had on your ship? I don\u2019t suppose you can put it in miles an hour, but I mean were you going fast or slow or how?\nA. We were going fairly slow I would think. I am sure.\nHis Lordship:\nI would like to know what he means, because when he says \u201cfairly slow\u201d I don\u2019t understand.\nA. (Continued) In the neighbourhood of four miles an hour when he (the Glenross) first loomed into view.\nQ. You have no way of estimating the speed?\nA. No sir.\nQ. You are just guessing at it. You have no record of the speed of the ship at all?\nA. Not at that speed. No, sir.\nThe nature of the wound inflicted by the Glenledi near the bow of the Glenross would further seem to show that the former was still moving forward at the time of the collision.\nMoreover, with great respect, I cannot think it an answer to a charge of breaking rule 22, to say that the Glenledi had come to a standstill at the time of the collision. What that rule required her to do was to give a warning to the other ship, so that the latter might \u201cbe immediately slowed to a speed barely sufficient for steerage way, and, if necessary, stopped and reversed, until the proper signals are given, answered, and understood, or until the vessels shall have passed each other.\u201d The navigation of the Glenledi may have been faultless, but it is hard to see how that would be an excuse for a breach of rule 22 requiring her to give a warning to the approaching ship. And I find it impossible, under all the circumstances, to say that the absence of a warning did not contribute to the collision. What Captain Taylor tells us he did would rather be calculated to mislead the other ship. (See Blamires v. Lancashire and Yorkshire Ry. Co.[1], and judgment of Blackburn J., at p. 288).\nI think therefore that the Glenledi cannot be absolved from liability for the collision.\nAt the same time I would not disturb the finding of liability of the learned trial judge against the Glenross. I would, however, base this liability on the ground that the Glenross did not reduce her speed to bare steerageway as required by rule 19, which says:\nRule 19. Every vessel shall, in thick weather, by reason of fog, mist, falling snow, heavy rainstorms, or other causes, go at moderate speed. A steam vessel hearing, apparently not more than four points from right ahead, the fog signal of another vessel shall at once reduce her speed to bare steerageway, and navigate with caution until the vessels shall have passed each other. (The italics are in the official edition of the rules.)\nLike the trial judge, I think the more reliable testimony shows that the Glenross would answer her helm at a slower speed than half-speed. Captain Hudson made the assertion that it would not, but his testimony was contradicted. The mere hearing of these fog signals at not more than four points from right ahead made it incumbent on the Glenross to reduce her speed to mere steerage way. It is a well known natural fact that the direction of sound cannot be accurately determined in a thick fog; and although Hudson felt confirmed by his change of course that the approaching vessel would pass him on his port side, under all the circumstances he should have strictly followed rule 19. It is extremely important, in the interest of the safety of the public, that no violation of such a rule of caution should be tolerated.\nInasmuch as the change of course of the Glenross was immediately signalled to the Glenledi, I do not regard it by itself as a sufficient ground of liability. Nor do I think that there was a failure on the part of the Glenross to keep a sufficient look-out.\nThe appeals should be allowed with costs and the formal judgments varied so as to declare the Glenledi equally liable for the damages caused by the collision with the Glenross.\n[1] (1873) L.R. 8 Exchequer, 283.\n",

(1909), s. 1357\u2014Art. 1986 C.C.\nSection 1357, R.S.Q. (1909), states that \u201call sums due to the Crown in virtue of this section (the section dealing with taxes on commercial corporations) shall constitute a privileged debt ranking immediately after law costs.\u201d The Dominion Bankruptcy Act, s. 51 (6), enacts that \u201cnothing in this section shall interfere with the collection of any taxes, rates or assessments now or at any time hereafter payable by or levied or imposed upon the debtor or upon any property of the debtor under any law of the Dominion, or of the province wherein such property is situate, or in which the debtor resides, nor prejudice or affect any lien or charge in respect of such property created by any such laws.\u201d In 1922, by an amendment to the Special War Revenue Act, 1915, being s. 17 of c. 47 of 12-13 Geo. V (D), the Dominion Parliament declared that \u201cnotwithstanding the provisions of The Bank Act and The Bankruptcy Act, or any other statute or law, the liability to the Crown of any person, firm or corporation, for payment of the excise taxes specified in The Special War Tax Revenue Act, 1915, and amendments thereto, shall constitute a first charge on the assets of such person, firm or corporation, and shall rank for payment in priority to all other claims of whatsoever kind heretofore or hereafter arising save and except only the judicial costs, fees and lawful expenses of an assignee or other public officer charged with the administration or distribution of such assets.\u201d\nThe debtor was owing to the Quebec Government the sum of $527.42 for taxes imposed under ss. 1345 et seq. R.S.Q., 1909, on commercial corporations. It was also indebted to the Dominion Government in the sum of $3,707.07 for sale taxes under The Special War Revenue Act, 1915, and amendments. After payment of law costs and the expenses of the trustee, there remained only $2,453.51 available for distribution. The trustee, confirmed by the trial judge, Panneton J., gave priority to the Dominion claim. The Court of King\u2019s Bench (Guerin J. dissenting) decided that the two claims should rank concurrently under article 1985 C.C.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Q.O.R. 43 K.B. 234), Duff and Rinfret JJ. dissenting, that the Dominion claim is entitled to preference over the claim of the province.\nHeld, also, that s. 16 of the Interpretation Act (R.S.C., 1906, c. 1), which enacts that \u201cno provision or enactment in any Act shall affect, in any manner whatsoever, the rights of His Majesty, his heirs or successors, unless it is expressly stated herein that His Majesty shall be bound thereby,\u201d does not operate to preserve the right asserted by the province to rank concurrently with the Dominion. Duff and Rinfret JJ. contra.\nHeld, also, that the language of s. 17 of c. 47 of 12-13 Geo. V (D)\u2014\u201cnotwithstanding the provisions of * * * the Bankruptcy Act or of any other statute or law\u201d\u2014excludes from operation here s. 51 (6) of the Bankruptcy Act as well as s. 1357, R.S.Q., 1909.\u2014The King v. Canadian Northern Railway Co. ([1923] A.C. 714) applied. Duff and Rinfret JJ. contra.\nHeld, further, that s. 17 of c. 47 of 12-13 Geo. V, (D) is intra vires of the Dominion Parliament.\nPer Anglin C.J.C.\u2014In so far as there may be conflict between\u2019 priority created by the Dominion statute and that which the Quebec statute purports to give, each being within the legislative jurisdiction conferred by the B.N.A. Act on the legislature which enacted it, it is well established that the former must prevail; and this must be so whether the provision for priority\u2014substantially the same in each Act\u2014is attributable to the exercise of a jurisdiction which should be regarded as an integral part of that conferred by an enumerated head, or as ancillary thereto.\nPer Duff and Rinfret JJ. (dissenting).\u2014The decisions of the Privy Council, which give preference to Dominion claim in case of conflict between Dominion and provincial legislation, have no application in this case, as these statutes do not cover the same field. Per Duff and Rinfret JJ. (dissenting).\u2014The reference in s. 17 of c: 47 of 12-13 Geo. V to the Bank Act (which would appear to contemplate the liens constituted by section 88 of that enactment) seems to reveal the intention that the \u201ccharge\u201d brought into being by section 17, in order to secure the payment of the \u201cexcise taxes\u201d there named, should, when it takes effect, have priority over liens of like character with those arising under the Bank Act; including of course (if the primacy established affects other Crown debts) liens of a similar character created for the purpose of securing the payment of provincial taxes, or other pecuniary obligations owing to the provincial Crown, numerous examples of which are evidenced in the statutory law of the provinces. Section 17, so construed, would have the effect, the direct effect, of entitling the Dominion to deal with a subject of provincial taxation or other private property in which the province holds a jus in re as such security, in such manner as to obliterate that jus in re, if necessary to give priority to the Dominion charge. \u201cProperty,\u201d in section 125 of the British North America Act, should be construed in its widest sense, and, in its widest sense, it would embrace such a jus in re. As other Crown debts are not mentioned, section 17 ought, especially in view of the Interpretation Act, to be construed as excluding such debts from its purview.\nPer Duff and Rinfret JJ. (dissenting).\u2014If the Dominion Parliament, in enacting the above section 17, has intended to constitute \u201ca first charge\u201d having priority even over a \u201cprivileged debt\u201d of the province of Quebec (R.S.Q., 1909, s. 1357), such legislation would be ultra vires.\nPer Newcombe J.\u2014Section 17, for the purposes of this case, is bankruptcy legislation under item 21 of the Dominion powers (B.N.A. Act, s. 91); and in enacting that section, it was the intention of Parliament, in the distribution of assets in a bankruptcy, to accord priority to the excise taxes specified in The Special War Revenue Act, 1915, and its amendments.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, sitting in bankruptcy, Panneton J., and maintaining the claim contained in the petition of the Attorney-General for Quebec.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nT. B. Heney and F. P. Varcoe for the appellant.\nC. Lanctot K.C. and A. Geoffrion K.C. for the respondent.\nAnglin C.J.C.\u2014I have had the advantage of perusing the carefully prepared opinion of my brother Mignault, who states the question for determination and the relevant facts; and in his conclusion I agree. In so far as there may be conflict between priority created by the Dominion statute (12-13 Geo. V, c. 47, s. 17) and that which the Quebec statute (R.S.Q., 1909, Arts. 1345 et seq.) purports to give, each being within the legislative jurisdiction conferred by the B.N.A. Act on the legislature which enacted it, it is well established that the former must prevail. This moist be so whether the provision for priority\u2014substantially the same in each Act\u2014is attributable to the exercise of a jurisdiction which should be regarded as an integral part of that conferred by an enumerated head, or as ancillary thereto. Royal Bank of Canada v. Larue[2]; Attorney General of Ontario v. Attorney General for Canada.[3]; City of Toronto v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[4]; Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Attorney General for Canada[5]; City of Montreal v. Montreal Street Railway Co.[6].\nWhether such conflict exists depends upon the construction of the Dominion statute. Has Parliament expressed the intention that\nall other claims of whatsoever kind heretofore or hereafter arising,\nover which\nthe excise taxes specified in the Special War Revenue Act, 1915, and amendments thereto.\nare given priority, shall include claims for taxes imposed by a Provincial statute which purports to give to them a like priority?\nPrima facie the phrase \u201call other claims of whatsoever kind, etc.,\u201d would include such claims. That it was meant to embrace them is, I think, made manifest by the introductory words of the section:\nNotwithstanding the provisions of The Bank Act and The Bankruptcy Act, or any other statute or law, * * *\nThe relevant provision of the Bankruptcy Act, s. 51 (6), had expressly preserved the priorities of taxes, rates and assessments imposed by provincial law. The intent to supersede that policy is expressed. Moreover, the words, \u201cany other statute or law,\u201d prima facie include all statutes and laws having force in regard to the administration of the property or estate being dealt with, by whatever authority imposed. If in a provincial statute providing for an exemption from taxation this prima facie meaning of the words \u201cany statute\u201d should prevail so as to include within them not only Acts of the same provincial legislature within that description, but also a similar statute of the Dominion Parliament, as was held in Rex v. Canadian Northern Railway Co.[7], I can see no good reason for refusing to give the like scope to the words, \u201cany other statute or law,\u201d in s. 17 of 12-13 Geo. V, c. 47 (D). In this respect I am unable to distinguish the case at bar in principle from the decision of the Judicial Committee in Rex v. Canadian Northern Railway Co.7; and the reason upon which that decision proceeds is distinctly in point.\nThe right of the Dominion Parliament, under the legislative jurisdiction conferred upon it by heads 3 and\/or 21 of s. 91 of the B.N.A. Act, to enact s. 17 appears to me to be so clear as to admit of no question. If so construed as to avoid any conflict with over-riding Dominion legislation, the provincial statute is, no doubt, within the authority given by head 2 of s. 92. The provincial tax in question is not covered by Art. 1994 (10) C.C. It depends entirely on post-Confederation legislation (6 Edw. 7, c 10; Arts. 1345 et seq., R.S.Q., 1909). To invoke Art. 1985 C.C. is, with respect, to beg the question. The effect of Arts. 1980-1 C.C. is not to create in favour either of the Dominion or of the province, as a creditor, a specific lien or charge on the debtor\u2019s property or any part thereof. There is nothing in the Quebec legislation which vests in the Crown in the right of the province, as a result of the imposition of the tax for which it provides, anything in the nature of \u201cproperty\u201d within the purview of s. 125 of the B.N.A. Act.\nNothing advanced upon the re-argument of this appeal before the full court has affected my views upon the questions in issue expressed in the foregoing opinion, which was written after the earlier argument had before a Court consisting of five judges.\nDuff J. (dissenting).\u2014Subsection 6 of section 51 of the Bankruptcy Act preserves (see particularly the French version) the rights created by article 1357 of the statutory law of Quebec. Neither that article nor section 17 of the Amendment to the War Revenue Act passed in 1915, does in my opinion give any priority over any lien charge or privilege vested in the Crown and preserved by section 51.\nThe reference to the Bank Act (which would appear to contemplate the liens constituted by section 88 of that enactment) seems to reveal the intention that the \u201ccharge\u201d brought into being by section 17, in order to secure the payment of the \u201cexcise taxes\u201d there named, should, when it takes effect, have priority over liens of like character with those arising under the Bank Act; including of course (if the primacy established affects other Crown debts) liens of a similar character created for the purpose of securing the payment of provincial taxes, or other pecuniary obligations owing to the provincial Crown, numerous examples of which are evidenced in the statutory law of the provinces. Section 17, so construed, would have the effect, the direct effect, of entitling the Dominion to deal with a subject of provincial taxation or other private property in which the province holds a jus in re as such security, in such manner as to obliterate that jus in re, if necessary to give priority to the Dominion charge. \u201cProperty,\u201d in my opinion, in section 125 of the British North America Act, should be construed in its widest sense, and, in its widest sense, it would embrace such a jus in re, which, in virtue of the prohibition in that section, would be immune from sale or appropriation under a taxing statute.\nThat, I think, must be the natural construction and effect of section 17, if it is read as applying to other debts of the Crown. Such debts are not mentioned in section 17 and the result of what I have just said, having regard to the provisions of the Interpretation Act, is that other pecuniary claims of the Crown are not prejudiced by the priority declared by that section. Likewise, the priority established by section 1357 neither by the express terms of that section nor by necessary inference affects such claims.\nBoth claims seem therefore to be of equal rank and should be satisfied rateably.\nI have had the opportunity of reading the judgment of my brother Rinfret and with his reasons I entirely concur.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs. Mignault J.\u2014This litigation arose in connection with the distribution of the proceeds realized by the trustee out of the assets of Silver Brothers, Limited, insolvents. After payment of law costs and of the expenses of the trustee, there remained $2,453.51 available for distribution. The Government of Canada had filed a claim for $3,707.07 for sale taxes due by the insolvent under the Special War Revenue Act, 1915 (chapter 8 of the statutes of 1915), and amendments, and the Government of the province of Quebec claimed $527.42, taxes due by the insolvents for the years 1921, 1922 and 1923 under a provincial statute imposing a tax on commercial corporations (Articles 1345 and following, R.S.Q., 1909). Both these claims are given priority after law costs by the statutes governing them. The issue here, as it has developed, is whether the Dominion is entitled to preference over the province, or whether the two claims should rank pari passu. In his dividend sheet the trustee gave priority to the Dominion, and in that he was sustained by the learned trial judge (Panneton J.). The Court of King\u2019s Bench, on the contrary, held (Guerin J., dissenting) that both claims should rank concurrently. The Dominion now appeals.\nIt may be observed that each legislature was within its jurisdiction when it imposed the tax, and, under reserve of the question whether the Dominion enactment should prevail here, I can see no reason to doubt that, as an incident of its taxing power, each legislature could give to its claim priority over the claims of ordinary creditors, subject, however, to this qualification that Parliament can undoubtedly, in a bankruptcy law, determine the priority of claims against the estate of a bankrupt, and no provincial legislature can interfere with this priority (Royal Bank of Canada v. Larue[8]).\nThere is, however, a saving clause in section 51 of The Bankruptcy Act which deals with the priority of claims. This clause, subsection 6 of section 51, reads as follows:\n(6) Nothing in this section shall interfere with the collection of any taxes, rates or assessments now or at any time hereafter payable by or levied or imposed upon the debtor or upon any property of the debtor under any law of the Dominion, or of the province wherein such property is situate, or in which the debtor resides, nor prejudice or affect any lien or charge in respect of such property created by any such laws. Section 86 of the Act should also be noted:\n86. Save as provided in this Act, the provisions of this Act relating to the remedies against the property of a debtor, the priorities of debts, the effect of a composition or scheme of arrangement, and the effect of a discharge, shall bind the Crown.\nAs the matter stood under the Bankruptcy Act, therefore, no lien created by federal or provincial legislation to secure the payment of taxes was affected.\nThe priority claimed by the provincial authorities was first enacted in 1906 by 6 Edward VII (Que.), c. 10. Under the Quebec civil code (which antedates Confederation, and consequently is the enactment of a legislature with plenary legislative power), the only privileged claim of the Crown\u2019 was against persons accountable for its moneys (comptables), this privilege being on movables only (Art. 1994, parag. 10). There does not appear to be, under the common law of Quebec as expressed in the civil code, or the code of civil procedure, which have been held to be binding on the Crown, any prerogative or other right of the Crown to priority, except as provided by Art. 1994 C.C. See Exchange Bank of Canada v. The Queen[9].\nThe priority asserted by the Dominion was enacted in 1922 by an amendment to the Special War Revenue Act, 1915. This amendment\u2014which is section 17 of chapter 47 of 12-13 George V (Can.), (this section was repealed in 1925 by 15-16 Geo. V, c. 26, s. 9)\u2014reads as follows:\n17. Notwithstanding the provisions of The Bank Act and The Bankruptcy Act, or any other statute or law, the liability to the Crown of any person, firm or corporation, for payment of the excise taxes specified in The Special War Tax Revenue Act, 1915, and amendments thereto, shall constitute a first charge on the assets of such person, firm or corporation, and shall rank for payment in priority to all other claims of whatsoever kind heretofore or hereafter arising save and except only the judicial costs, fees and lawful expenses of an assignee or other public officer charged with the administration or distribution of such assets.\nArticle 1357 R.S.Q., 1909, gives the provincial tax priority after law costs. It says:\nAll sums due to the Crown in virtue of this section (the section dealing with taxes on commercial corporations) shall constitute a privileged debt ranking immediately after law costs.\nThe appellant contends that full effect must be given to section 1.7, notwithstanding any priority created by provincial legislation such as Article 1357, R.S.Q., 1909. This section states that the Dominion tax \u201cshall constitute a first charge on the assets,\u201d and shall rank for payment \u201cin priority to all other claims of whatsoever kind heretofore or hereafter arising,\u201d save only the judicial costs, fees and lawful expenses of the assignee or other public officer charged with the administration or distribution of the assets. This tax, the appellant argues, would not be \u201ca first charge,\u201d if the claim for the provincial tax were entitled to rank concurrently with it upon the assets of the insolvent.\nThe contention chiefly relied on by the respondent is founded on section 16 of The Interpretation Act (R.S.C., 1906, c. 1), which states that\nno provision or enactment in any Act shall affect, in any manner whatsoever, the rights of His Majesty, his heirs or successors, unless it is expressly stated herein that His Majesty shall be bound thereby.\nAnd the respondent argues that, under this rule of construction, section 17 of the amendment to the Special War Revenue Act, 1915, notwithstanding the generality of its language, must be read as if it had stated that the right of the Crown in right of the province to the priority granted by article 1357 R.S.Q., 1909, is not to be affected thereby.\nIt may be observed that section 16 of The Interpretation Act is merely a re-statement of the fundamental rule of statutory construction of the common law that the Crown is not bound by a statute unless it be specially named therein, or unless there is a necessary implication to be drawn from the provisions of the statute or the nature of the enactment that the Crown was intended to be bound thereby (Beal, Cardinal Rules of Legal Interpretation, 3rd ed., p. 332).\nIt would seem likely that \u201cthe rights of His Majesty, his heirs or successors\u201d, intended to be preserved by section 16, are rights derived from the prerogative, and not rights created by statute. Rights of the latter category could hardly continue to exist for the future when the statute creating them is repealed, or excluded by a subsequent enactment, and the consent of the Crown as a component part of the Legislature would seem to be all that is required. In the case of the prerogative, the Crown\u2019s expressed consent is necessary, but even then \u201cif the whole ground of something which could be done by the prerogative is covered by the statute, it is the statute that rules\u201d (per Lord Dunedin in Attorney General v. De Keyser\u2019s Royal Hotel[10]).\nHere, moreover, we have an enactment the whole purpose of which is to grant to the Crown in right of the Dominion priority for the excise taxes specified by The Special War Revenue Act, 1915, and amendments, which priority exists \u201cnotwithstanding the provisions .... of any other statute or law\u201d. These terms are wide enough to exclude any statute federal or provincial (The King v. Canadian Northern Railway Co.[11], the converse case), and of course such an enactment as Article 1357, R.S.Q. 1909. The appellant\u2019s contention based on section 16 of The Interpretation Act, a federal statute, which moreover would come within the scope of the words \u201cnotwithstanding the provisions of any other statute or law,\u201d would defeat the very purpose of section 17. It is obvious that the Dominion tax could not be \u201ca first charge\u201d after judicial costs and the fees and expenses of the assignee, if the provincial tax were to rank immediately after law costs. Even if the rights of the Crown referred to in The Interpretation Act could be considered as comprising statutory rights, the exclusion of the statute creating these rights would render them ineffective against the Crown in right of the Dominion.\nThe respondent also relies on subsection 6 of section 51 of The Bankruptcy Act, which, with respect to the collection of taxes, rates or assessments, recognizes the priority or lien conferred by provincial legislation. But full effect must be given to section 17, notwithstanding The Bankruptcy Act, so that, if Parliament did not transcend its jurisdiction, there appears little doubt that any priority granted by Article 1357, R.S.Q., 1909, and preserved by The Bankruptcy Act, is excluded.\nThe trial judge sustained the trustee\u2019s dividend sheet on the ground that there being a conflict here between Dominion and provincial legislation in a field open to both, the Dominion statute must prevail. In support of this view, the appellant has referred us to four pronouncements of the Judicial Committee: Tennant v. Union Bank of Canada[12]; Attorney General of Ontario v. Attorney General of Canada[13]; Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Attorney General of Canada[14]; Compagnie Hydraulique de St. Fran\u00e7ois v. Continental Heat and Light Co.[15].\nThe principle deducible from these cases can be stated in the words of Sir Arthur Wilson, in the last mentioned case, at page 198:\nWhere a given field of legislation is within the competence both of the Parliament of Canada and of the provincial Legislature, and both have legislated, the enactment of the Dominion Parliament must prevail over that of the province if the two are in conflict.\nAssuming that both Parliament and the Quebec Legislature were within their jurisdiction when they granted priority to these taxes after law costs, there would clearly appear to be conflict between the two statutes. It is nihil ad rem to say that these enactments do not by themselves necessarily clash, but that the conflict is brought about by the accidental circumstance that the assets are insufficient to pay both claims, because it is in view of this very circumstance that Parliament has ordered that the claim for the Dominion tax \u201cshall constitute a first charge on the assets The judgment appealed from denies this right to the Dominion, since it allows the province to share with the former this first place in the distribution of the assets after payment of costs. Such a case of conflict between enactments of the Dominion and the province should not be met by giving both enactments concurrent effect. I do not think that article 1985 of the Civil Code applies to such a case. Any argument based on that article begs the question, for the point to be decided is whether the two claims are of \u201cequal rank\u201d.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the Court of King\u2019s Bench and the judgment of the learned trial judge restored.\nNewcombe J.\u2014In this case, the provincial Crown has no prerogative preference, the debtor not being a comptable. Exchange Bank v. The Queen[16]. The Quebec tax was imposed under s. XVIII, R.S.Q., 1909; the preference upon which the Attorney General of Quebec relies is created by these words (art. 1357 of that section):\u2014\nAll sums due to the Crown in virtue of this section (XVIII) shall constitute a privileged debt, ranking immediately after law costs.\nThe alleged provincial privilege therefore depends upon an exercise of legislative power which Quebec claims to possess under s. 92 of the British North America Act, 1867. The provision is ultra vires of Quebec, if the power do not exist; or, if it do exist, the provincial enactment may be over-ridden by the Parliament of Canada in the use of any apt ancillary power which the Dominion has under the enumerated heads of s. 91 of that Act.\nAssuming that the province had the power of enactment, an over-riding power is to be found in the following items of s. 91:\u2014\n(1) \u201cThe public debt and property\u201d;\n(3) \u201cThe raising of money by any mode or system of taxation\u201d;\n(21) \u201cBankruptcy and insolvency\u201d;\none or another, but not logically within each of them. Cushing v. Dupuy[17]; Attorney General of Ontario v. Attorney General of Canada[18].\nThe exercise of the Dominion power is evidenced by s. 17 of c. 47 of the Dominion Acts of 1922, which reads:\u2014\nNotwithstanding the provisions of The Bank Act and The Bankruptcy Act, or any other statute or law, the liability to the Crown of any person, firm or corporation, for payment of the excise taxes specified in The Special War Revenue Act, 1915, and amendments thereto, shall constitute a first charge on the assets of such person, firm or corporation, and shall rank for payment in priority to all other claims of whatsoever kind heretofore or hereafter arising save and except only the judicial costs, fees and lawful expenses of an assignee or other public officer charged with the administration or distribution of such assets.\nAs to the interpretation of this section, I see no reason to doubt that it was the intention of Parliament, in the distribution of assets in bankruptcy, to accord priority to the excise taxes specified in The Special War Revenue Act, 1915, and its amendments. The competing claims are stated in the admissions, as follows:\u2014\n1. Messrs. Silver Brothers, the debtor above named was declared bankrupt by an order rendered by this honourable court on or about 31st December, 1923.\n2. The Government of the Dominion of Canada duly fyled with the trustee, a claim to the amount of $3,707.07, for sales tax imposed in virtue of the Special War Revenue Act, 1915, and amendments, said tax having become due subsequent to the 28th of June, 1922, the date on which the Act 12 and 13 George V, Statutes of Canada, 1922, Chapter 47, amending the Special War Revenue Act, came into force.\n3. The Government of the Province of Quebec also duly fyled with the trustee a claim to the amount of $527.42, for taxes due by the debtor for the years 1921, 1922 and 1923, under the provisions of Articles 1345 and following, of the Revised Statues of Quebec, imposing a tax on commercial corporations.\nAnd, for the purposes of this case, s. 17 is, in my judgment, bankruptcy legislation under item (21) of the Dominion powers. The provision is, therefore, competent to the Dominion Parliament.\nI do not think there is anything in the Dominion Interpretation Act which is intended to conflict with these conclusions; and, in any case, s. 17 must have its operation as expressed, \u201cnotwithstanding any other statute or law\nRinfret J. (dissenting).\u2014Je suis d\u2019avis qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agit pas ici d\u2019un cas o\u00f9 les deux Parlements ont l\u00e9gif\u00e9r\u00e9 sur le m\u00eame sujet (\u201csame field\u201d) et, d\u00e8s lors, qu\u2019on ne doit pas appliquer \u00e0 cette cause les arr\u00eats du Conseil Priv\u00e9 qui, dans les cas de conflit, ont accord\u00e9 la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislation f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\nIl ne me para\u00eet pas y avoir d\u2019analogie entre la question qui nous est soumise et, par exemple, la subordination du pouvoir provincial en mati\u00e8re de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et de droits civils au pouvoir f\u00e9d\u00e9ral en mati\u00e8re de faillite, qui a fait l\u2019objet de la d\u00e9cision re Royal Bank of Canada v. Larue.[19].\nL\u2019effet de cette d\u00e9cision et des autres semblables est d\u2019oblit\u00e9rer la l\u00e9gislation provinciale et de laisser subsister exclusivement la l\u00e9gislation f\u00e9d\u00e9rale sur le point en conflit.\nAinsi, pour poursuivre l\u2019exemple tir\u00e9 de la cause de Royal Bank of Canada v. Larue19, l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que judiciaire cr\u00e9\u00e9e en vertu de la loi provinciale y fut d\u00e9clar\u00e9e inexistante parce que la loi de faillite f\u00e9d\u00e9rale le d\u00e9cr\u00e9tait. Le r\u00e9sultat fut que la loi provinciale en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce fut compl\u00e8tement mise de c\u00f4t\u00e9. Il ne saurait en \u00eatre ainsi en mati\u00e8re de taxation. Il ne me para\u00eet pas admissible que le Parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral puisse de cette fa\u00e7on contr\u00f4ler ou limiter\u2014et, au besoin, rendre inefficace\u2014le pouvoir de taxer qui appartient aux provinces. Cette distinction n\u00e9cessaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 signal\u00e9e pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment par le Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans la cause de Citizens Insurance Company of Canada v. Parsons[20], o\u00f9 Sir Montague Smith dit (p. 108):\nNotwithstanding this endeavour to give pre-eminence to the Dominion Parliament in cases of a conflict of powers, it is obvious that in some cases where this apparent conflict exists, the legislature could not have intended that the powers exclusively assigned to the provincial legislature should be absorbed in those given to the Dominion Parliament. Take as one instance the subject \u201cmarriage and divorce,\u201d contained in the enumeration of subjects in sect. 91; it is evident that solemnization of marriage would come within this general description; yet \u201csolemnization of marriage in the province\u201d is enumerated among the classes of subjects in sect. 92, and no one can doubt, notwithstanding the general language of sect. 91, that this subject is still within the exclusive authority of the legislatures of the provinces. So \u201cthe raising of money by any mode of taxation\u201d is enumerated among the classes of subjects in sect. 91; but, though the description is sufficiently large and general to include \u201cdirect taxation within the province, in order to the raising of a revenue for provincial purposes,\u201d assigned to the provincial legislatures by sect. 92, it obviously could not have been intended that, in this instance also, the general power should override the particular one. With regard to certain classes of subjects, therefore, generally described in sect. 91, legislative power may reside as to some matters falling within the general description of these subjects in the legislatures of the provinces. In these cases it is the duty of the Courts, however difficult it may be, to ascertain in what degree, and to what extent, authority to deal with matters falling within these classes of subjects exists in each legislature and to define in the particular case before them the limits of their respective powers. It could not have been the intention that a conflict should exist; and, in order to prevent such a result, the two sections must be read together, and the language of one interpreted, and, where necessary, modified, by that of the other. In this way it may, in most cases, be found possible to arrive at a reasonable and practical construction of the language of the sections, so as to reconcile the respective powers they contain, and give effect to all of them.\nJe r\u00e9p\u00e8te, avec le Conseil priv\u00e9, parlant du pouvoir f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, \u201cLe pr\u00e9l\u00e8vement de deniers par tous modes ou syst\u00e8mes de taxation\u201d (Acte de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique Britannique du Nord, art. 91, parag. 3) et le comparant avec le pouvoir provincial, \u201cLa taxation directe dans les limites de la province, dans le but de pr\u00e9lever un revenu pour les objets provinciaux\u201d (Acte cit\u00e9, art. 92, parag. 2),\u2014 It obviously could not have been intended that, in this instance * * * the general power should override the particular one\n\u2014Ces deux paragraphes (91-3 et 92-2) conf\u00e8rent des pouvoirs absolus et ind\u00e9pendants, dont l\u2019un ne peut empi\u00e9ter sur l\u2019autre, tant en vertu de leur nature m\u00eame que par application de l\u2019article 125 de l\u2019Acte de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique Britannique du Nord (comme le fait remarquer mon coll\u00e8gue, Mr. le Juge Duff, dont j\u2019adopte le raisonnement).\nSi, par cons\u00e9quent, la l\u00e9gislation f\u00e9d\u00e9rale qu\u2019on invoque (\u201cAn Act to amend The Special War Revenue Act,\u201d 1915, 12-13 Geo.

Il est \u00e0 pr\u00e9sumer que le l\u00e9gislateur f\u00e9d\u00e9ral a voulu que sa loi sur The Special War Revenue f\u00fbt comprise conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 cette prescription de sa propre loi d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation.\nIl en r\u00e9sulterait que l\u2019art. 17 du Special War Revenue Act, 1915 ne porte pas \u201catteinte aux droits de Sa Majest\u00e9\u201d repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par la province de Qu\u00e9bec, tels qu\u2019ils sont exprim\u00e9s dans l\u2019art. 1357 des Statuts Revis\u00e9s de Qu\u00e9bec, 1909, et que chaque l\u00e9gislation doit recevoir son plein effet.\nPar suite de l\u2019insuffisance des deniers dans la faillite de Silver Bros., il survient une impossibilit\u00e9 de payer int\u00e9gralement les deux r\u00e9clamations.

The frauds committed by Rogers began in September, 1919, and were not discovered until the 10th of January, 1922, and during that period Rogers procured from the respondent bank drafts on New York, payable to his own order, in exchange for cheques payable to the bank drawn by himself and another of the properly authorized signing officers of Willis, Faber & Company. The amounts of these drafts, plus exchange, were charged by the bank against the latter\u2019s account. The appellant company contended that the respondent was not entitled to do so, the appellant exercising in this action the rights of the insured, to which it was subrogated by the latter. In 1912, a resolution of the directors of the insured company, a copy of which was in possession of the respondent bank, directed that any two of four officers therein designated, Rogers being one of them, were \u201cauthorized to make, draw, sign, accept or endorse, bills of exchange, promissory notes, cheques, orders for payment or other commercial paper on behalf of the company.\u201d The respondent bank submitted that what Rogers did was within his ostensible authority; and it also argued that the insured was negligent in not sooner discovering Rogers\u2019 frauds and through this negligence the officers of the bank were misled. The judgments of the trial judge and the Court of King\u2019s Bench were in favour of the respondent bank.\nHeld, Rinfret J. dissenting, that, upon the evidence, the respondent bank was not entitled to charge against the insured company\u2019s account the drafts obtained from it by Rogers. The respondent\u2019s contentions cannot be upheld in view of the evidence as to the actual course of business followed in the bank and of the terms of the resolution of 1912; and the doctrine of \u201cholding out\u201d has no application in this case: the bank in acting on Rogers\u2019 directions was not acting under any belief in the existence of Rogers\u2019 assumed general authority and was not misled by any such belief or by any act of negligence of the insured company.\nPer Rinfret J. (dissenting).\u2014There is a well established rule that the question \u201cwhether or not the evidence establishes that a person acts without negligence is a question of fact.\u201d ([1920] A.C. 683, at p. 688); and, in this case, both the trial judge and the appellate court unanimously found that the bank acted without negligence. The bank followed towards the insured company the procedure the latter had established for many years, and no positive acts of negligence were proven. Moreover, the cheques charged against the insured company\u2019s account were in accordance with the resolution of 1912 and properly charged against that account; the foreign drafts were not charged to the insured, but they were really sold and delivered to Rogers for the insured in consideration of the respective cheques, and the respondent bank cannot be held responsible for the subsequent misappropriation of those drafts by Rogers.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, at Montreal, Duclos J., and dismissing the appellant\u2019s action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nJ. A. Mann K.C. for the appellant.\nA. R. Holden K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Duff, Newcombe, Lamont and Smith JJ.) was delivered by\nDuff J.\u2014This litigation arises out of a series of frauds committed by one Rogers, the chief accountant of Willis Falber & Company, who were customers of the respondent bank. The title of the appellants to sue rests upon the fact that, in execution of the obligations under an insurance policy by which they insured Willis Faber & Company against losses arising from embezzlements and defalcations by certain employees, of whom Rogers was one, they paid in respect of the defalcations of Rogers the sum of $5,000, and an additional sum for legal costs, making up the total of the amount sued for. The questions in controversy relate strictly to the liability of the respondent bank in principle, the correctness of the claim as advanced, in point of amount, on the assumption that such liability exists, not being challenged. The frauds began in September, 1919, and were not discovered until the 10th of January, 1922, and during that period Rogers procured from the bank drafts on New York, payable to his own order, in exchange for cheques payable to the bank drawn by himself and another of the properly authorized signing officers of Willis Faber & Company. The amounts of these drafts, plus exchange, were charged by the bank against Willis Faber & Company\u2019s account, and the issue in the litigation is to whether they were entitled \u201cto do so. The trial judge and the Court of King\u2019s Bench decided this issue in favour of the respondent bank.\nThe practice of Willis Faber & Company, in respect of foreign drafts, was as follows: Rogers, who was the chief accountant, would prepare a cheque and present it for signature to the signing officers, of whom he was one, with a statement of the account to be paid. It seems to have been understood that Rogers was to be a signatory only when Mr. Dettmers, the treasurer, or Mr. Mercer, the secretary, was absent from the office; but apparently the cheques for foreign drafts usually bore the signature of Rogers. Rogers would ascertain the rate of exchange from the bank by telephone, and the cheque would be drawn, payable to the Bank of Montreal, for the amount of the account plus the exchange. The cheque itself contained no direction as to the application of the proceeds. The requisition for the draft was not drawn up in the office, or signed by the officer who signed the cheque with Rogers. Rogers, at the bank, would prepare the requisition, giving the amount of the draft, and the name of the payee, and sign it in the name of Willis Faber & Company. In the cases with which we are concerned, the signature was that of the firm only; there was nothing except the handwriting to identify the person affixing it. Whether or not this was the practice in other cases, is not stated. The draft would be drawn up in the foreign exchange department of the bank, and would be delivered by the foreign exchange teller to Rogers, who would deliver to the teller the cheque of Willis Faber & Company, which he had got certified by the ledger keeper. The teller, would, as she explains in her evidence, see that the cheque was certified, but would not concern herself about the payee of the draft, and would recognize Rogers, without knowing his name or the nature of his authority, as a person who usually received drafts for Willis Faber & Company. If the amount of the cheque was slightly in excess of the draft, as it was occasionally, she would pay the change to Rogers. If there was a deficit, it would be paid to her by him in currency.\nFirst of all, it is important to note the actual authority of Rogers. A resolution of the directors of Willis Faber and Company of Canada Limited of 1912, designates the persons authorized to execute documents on behalf of the company in these terms:\u2014\nResolved that any two of the following persons, namely, Mr. Raymond Willis, president, Mr. O. W. Dettmers, director, Mr. E. N. Mercer, director, and K. V. Rogers, accountant, be and they are hereby authorized to make, draw, sign, accept or endorse, bills of exchange, promissory notes, cheques, orders for payment or other commercial paper on behalf of the company, and that Mr. Raymond Willis, president, and Mr. O. W. Dettmers, director, and Mr. E. N. Mercer, director, and either of them singly be and they are hereby authorized to make all contracts and engagements other than the foregoing for and on behalf of the company and that this resolution replace the resolution of directors dealing with the same matter and passed on the 5th January, 1911, which former resolution shall hereafter be of no effect.\nA copy of this resolution was in the possession of the bank, and from its terms, the bank knew that Rogers was invested with no general authority to execute documents of any description in the name of the company, except as one of two signatories. In accordance with the practice above mentioned, he had authority, to take a cheque signed by Dettmers or Mercer and himself to the bank, and obtain a draft on New York payable to the creditor for the payment of whose account the cheque had been drawn, if such authority could be derived from the consent of the signatories of the cheque. I shall assume that the practice of permitting Rogers to act as the intermediary to communicate the name of the payee to the bank, and to receive the draft from the bank, was ratified by the directors. But ratification cannot be extended beyond the authority which in fact was committed to Rogers\u2014and this authority was limited to procuring a draft payable to the person to whom Willis Faber & Company were indebted, according to the statement produced by Rogers upon which the cheque was based. He had in fact, no general authority to direct the application of the proceeds of such a cheque. Actual authority, therefore, Rogers had none, to direct the bank to charge any of the moneys in dispute against their customer\u2019s account, nor had he actual general authority to do any class of acts within which such a direction would fall.\nThe bank\u2019s case rests upon its contention that what Rogers did was within his ostensible authority, in other words, that he was held out by the customer as having a general authority to instruct the bank concerning the application of the proceeds of such cheques in the purchase of foreign drafts, and that the bank acted in the belief that such general authority was vested in him.\nThere appear to be two conclusive answers to this contention. One arises out of the actual course of business in the bank, and the other out of the resolution of 1912 which had been communicated to the bank.\nLet it first be observed that, as a direction to the bank for the application of moneys standing to the credit of the customer, the cheque itself was incomplete. It was a cheque payable to the bank, and such a cheque, though debited to the customer\u2019s account, was still, in the hands of the bank, held for the customer until it was applied pursuant to a direction by the customer to an authorized purpose. In the case of each of the cheques with which we are concerned, that direction consists, as the bank alleges, of a requisition for a draft on New York, payable to K. V. Rogers, which requisition was presented and signed in the name of the customer by Rogers. In other words, the direction consists of a request by Rogers to hand to himself a draft on New York, payable to his own order. The contention is, that is to say, that by entrusting Rogers from time to time with a cheque payable to the bank, in order to obtain a draft on New York, payable to a particular payee, the customer held Rogers out as having authority to apply, or to direct the application of, the proceeds of such a cheque in purchasing, and procuring delivery into his own hands of a draft payable to his own order.\nOn the face of it, this does not seem very convincing; but it is not necessary to analyse the argument critically, because it is impossible to reconcile it with the fact that the bank had before it the resolution of 1912. By that resolution, cheques, orders for payment and \u201ccommercial paper\u201d of a similar character, were to be signed on behalf of the appellants by two of four named persons, of whom Rogers, it is true, was one. It is impossible to suppose that any banker of ordinary judgment, with this resolution before him, could have inferred from Rogers\u2019 authorized acts that he had power to direct, by his sole signature, that funds standing to the credit of their customer should be paid to himself, or that those funds should be applied in the purchase, from the bank, of bank drafts payable to his order, and that these drafts should be delivered into his own hands. To adapt the language of Lord Cave in Australian Bank v. Perel[1], speaking for the Privy Council, to act upon such an inference must have the effect of \u201cneutralizing and defeating\u201d the resolution, which, I repeat, for cheques, orders for payment and similar documents required at least two signatures. The requisition was treated by the bank as the equivalent of a cheque or an order for payment.\nThe bank, of course, seeks to bring its case within the principle of article 1730 of the. Civil Code,\nthe mandator is liable to third parties, who in goad faith contract with a person not his mandatory, under the belief that he is so, when the mandator has given reasonable cause for such belief.\nThis principle does not in substance differ from that of the rules of the common law under the heads of \u201costensible\u201d authority, \u201capparent\u201d authority and \u201cholding out,\u201d and the decisions under those rules may usefully be referred to, as illustrating the application of the principle. In Russo-Chinese Bank v. Li Yau Sam[2], Lord Atkinson in delivering the judgment of the Privy Council says:\nthe several authorities cited by Mr. Scrutton, from Grant v. Norway[3], down to Ruben v. Great Fingall Consolidated[4], establish, in their Lordships\u2019 opinion, the proposition that, in order that the principle of \u201cholding out\u201d should in any given case of agency apply, the act done by the agent, and relied upon to bind the principal, must be an act of that particular class of acts which the agent is held out as having a general authority on behalf of his principal to do; and, of course, the party prejudiced must have believed in the existence of that general authority and been thereby misled.\nIt is argued, accordingly, that Rogers being the chief accountant of Willis Faber & Company, and their trusted employee, it might properly be assumed that his employers were taking drafts payable to his order for remittances to New York, for some convenience of their own. Evidence was offered to show that this would not be an unusual course, if the person transmitting the funds wished to avoid disclosing to the bank the name of the transmittee. This evidence ought no doubt to have been received, but the appeal does not turn upon it. It may be assumed that such a practice is not unknown and that the bank was aware of it. Rogers, although chief accountant, and although having authority to act as co-signatory in the execution of documents requiring two signatures, had no authority under the resolution to execute any document on behalf of the company without the concurrence of one of the other three persons named for that purpose. With regard to certain documents, this authority was committed to each of the other three; it was not committed to Rogers. The customer no doubt, by ratifying the practice by which Rogers was authorized to communicate the name of the payee to whom moneys were to be transmitted, had departed from the strict course laid down in the resolution of 1912; but there is a vast difference between the departure authorized, which permitted only the communication of the name of the payee, for the payment of whose account the cheque was drawn, and the receipt of the draft payable to such payee, and the departure postulated by the argument I am now considering\u2014a general authority, which would involve an authority in Rogers to place the funds of his employers (to the amount of the cheque), under his sole control; an authority, the existence of which would be quite incompatible with the object of the resolution, as well as with its terms, that were carefully framed to prevent such control over the funds of the company by any one of its signing officers.\nIt is contended also on behalf of the bank, that the customer was negligent in not sooner discovering Rogers\u2019 frauds, and that through this negligence the officers of the bank were misled, and a course of business was established according to which Rogers\u2019 directions were followed. I postpone the consideration of this contention for the present.\nIn truth, the doctrine of \u201cholding out\u201d has no application here; the bank in acting on Rogers\u2019 directions was not acting under any belief in the existence of Rogers\u2019 general authority and was not misled by any such belief. The officials of the foreign exchange department did not concern themselves about either the identity or the authority of the person who attached the customer\u2019s name to the requisition. This is, on the evidence, indisputable. The teller who handed the drafts to Rogers recognized him as the person who usually received the customer\u2019s drafts, but beyond the fact of his possession of the cheque, she did not direct her attention to the matter of his authority. The possession of the cheque was, as she and Mr. Pratt, who was the principal witness for the bank, both stated, regarded as a sufficient credential. From the bank\u2019s point of view\u2014it is quite plain\u2014the business hinged upon that.\nThe evidence does not permit us to proceed on the hypothesis that in acting on the latest of Rogers\u2019 directions, the bank officials were influenced by any consideration in addition to those which influenced them at the inception of his frauds. Neither the terms of the resolution, nor Rogers\u2019 position, nor the course of business, was adverted to.\nWhat I have just said seems to be also a complete answer to the contention that the bank was misled by the negligence of the appellants.\nThe appeal should be allowed and judgment entered for the appellants for the sum of seven thousand five hundred and sixty-five dollars and sixty-one cents ($7,565.61), with costs of the appeal and in the courts below.\nRinfret J. (dissenting).\u2014The appellant, the Dominion Gresham Guarantee and Casualty Company, is seeking to exercise against the respondent, the Bank of Montreal, certain alleged rights of Willis Faber Company of Canada Limited, in which it was subrogated by the latter. For all purposes the case must be treated as one between the Willis Company (which I will call the company) and the Bank of Montreal (which I will call the bank). The rights asserted in this litigation are supposed to have arisen out of a series of frauds perpetrated by K. V. Rogers, the chief accountant of the company, in procuring from the bank drafts payable to his own order in exchange for cheques of the company payable to the bank\u2019s order. In the course of its ordinary business, and since a long number of years, the company had occasion very frequently to purchase from the bank drafts on New York or London, In all cases the practice followed was the same. I will quote from the evidence of Dettmers, one of the directors of the company, and put forward by it as being the official who could give the best information concerning the inside management of its affairs:\u2014\nOur usual custom was to telephone the bank and give them particulars of the draft or drafts required.\nQ. Not you, or Mr. Mercer (another director)?\nA. No.\nQ. That would be done by Mr. Rogers?\nA. By Rogers.\nThe next move was the preparation of a cheque to pay the draft or drafts. A resolution adopted by the company was to the effect that\nany two of the following persons, namely, Mr. Raymond Willis, president, Mr. O. W. Dettmers, director, Mr. E. N. Mercer, director, and K. V. Rogers, accountant, be and they are hereby authorized to make, draw, sign, accept or endorse bills of exchange, promissory notes, cheques, orders for payment or other commercial paper on behalf of the company.\nThe cheque for the drafts would therefore be prepared in this way, as explained by Mercer:\nRogers would come into my private office with a cheque in favour of the Bank of Montreal, and in most cases (I could not swear it was on every occasion) there was a document attached to the cheque. He would invite me to place my signature on the cheque, saying he wished to remit to New York.\n* * * * *\nQ. In respect to Rogers obtaining those cheques, what was the usual custom in regard to presenting some document with them? What was the usual custom when Rogers came in with a cheque and wanted it signed, as regards handing in some document with the cheque?\nMr. Holden, K.C., of counsel for defendant objects to the question as irrelevant and illegal.\nThe objection is reserved by the court.\nA. There was a statement attached to the cheque.\nQ. I understood you to say you could not swear that happened in every case?\nA. Quite so.\nQ. Can you say from memory just now the number of oases in which it happened?\nA. To the best of my recollection it generally happened.\nQ. What was the nature of that document you would have before you?\nA. It would be just a statement showing a certain sum due. That we owe a certain firm, say Johnston and Higgins, New York, a certain sum of money.\nRogers would then go to the bank and, as to what took place at the bank, we have the testimony of Miss C. Aus- tin, who occupied the position of exchange teller throughout the period material to the case:\nBy the court:\nQ. If I understand the procedure correctly, it was this: a requisition note for the draft would be handed in to your draft department?\nA. Yes.\nQ. The draft would be prepared there?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And the prepared draft, with the requisition note, would be sent to your wicket?\nQ. Yes.\nQ. And you would surrender it to the party who came for it, on receiving a cheque covering the amount?\nA. Yes.\nAnd later on Miss Austin added:\nQ. To what extent did you examine the cheques? Did you examine them to see that they were payable to the bank?\nA. Yes. I noticed they were payable to the Bank of Montreal, and that they were certified.\nWe have thus the outline of the whole procedure in the very words of the witnesses. Such was the course pursued between the bank and the company, so far as the evidence goes, from January 17, 1910, to April 18, 1922, presumably before Rogers became chief accountant and obviously for three months after his frauds were discovered and he had left the employ of the company.\nIt is admitted that the procedure was the same for drafts issued to creditors of the company in the ordinary course of business and those issued to Rogers\u2019 order. It is further admitted by the company that the cheques themselves in all cases were complete and regular on their face.\nThe contention of the company is that by issuing drafts to Rogers\u2019 own order, the bank committed \u201cillegal, wrongful and grossly negligent acts\u201d and the company has suffered loss which it \u201cis entitled to have and recover * * * by way of damages.\u201d\nThe well established rule is that whether or not the evidence establishes that a person acts without negligence is a question of fact. (Lord Dunedin in Commissioners of Taxation v. English, Scottish and Australian Bank)[5].\nIn the present case, both the trial judge and the Court of King\u2019s Bench unanimously found that the bank acted without negligence. The bank followed towards the company the procedure it had established since a number of years as regards hundreds of foreign drafts issued daily at the request of all its customers. It is certain that no positive acts of negligence were proven. In fact, on this point, the company was content practically to rest its case on the proposition that the drafts in question being made to the order of Rogers was at least notice that he was appropriating to his own use the company\u2019s money and should have put the bank upon inquiry. That this would not necessarily follow would appear to be the effect of the judgment of the Privy Council in Corporation Agencies Limited v. Home Bank of Canada[6]. There are many instances where it may be found convenient for a company to adopt such a course. One of those instances is in evidence in the present case: Rogers was paid his salary by a cheque to his own order. It is conceivable that, in the ordinary course of business and consistently with the custom of trade and banking in Montreal and in the province of Quebec, it was not an unusual occurrence for a company to ask for foreign drafts to be issued to the order of its own officials. At all events, it does not lie in the mouth of the appellant to contend otherwise when, by its own unwarranted objections at the trial, it prevented the bank from establishing such a practice in evidence.\nI would therefore conclude that, on that ground, the appellant\u2019s case must fail.\nBut the bank is alleged to be at fault yet for another reason. The bank had a copy of the resolution of the company (already referred to) appointing certain persons therein named as its signing officers and requiring the signatures of at least two of them on its\nbills of exchange, promissory notes, cheques, orders for payment or other commercial paper.\nOn the strength of that resolution, it is argued that the bank should not have issued foreign drafts to Rogers\u2019 order except upon requisition notes signed by two of the persons mentioned.\nVery respectfully, I do not think the resolution has any application to this case.\nThe company had its bank account with the respondent, and, through the resolution, the bank was given the company\u2019s instructions as to how moneys should be paid out of such bank account. It is admitted that the cheques presented, certified to and charged against that account were in all respects in accordance with the resolution and properly chargeable against the account.\nThe foreign drafts themselves were not charged to the company. They did not represent funds belonging to the company. They were orders for payment by the bank out of its own funds. The bank, under its charter powers, dealt in those drafts as a merchant with his goods. The bank sold the drafts to the company. The company purchased the drafts which were issued and delivered to it in consideration of the respective cheques. The cheques were given in payment. In my opinion, the resolution had nothing to do with that kind of transaction. The respondent, so far as it was concerned, stood in the same position as if the cheques had been drawn upon some other bank. This view is expressed in the following passage of Mr. Justice Bernier\u2019s judgment in the Court of King\u2019s Bench:\nLa compagnie donnait l\u2019ordre \u00e0 Rogers d\u2019acheter des traites de la banque; elle lui remettait l\u2019argent n\u00e9cessaire, sous forme de ch\u00e8ques d\u00fbment sign\u00e9s; Rogers allait chercher la marchandise et la payait.\nDans mon opinion, la formule de r\u00e9quisition remplie par Rogers n\u2019a aucune importance.\nLa marchandise \u00e9tait livr\u00e9e \u00e0 Rogers, comme elle aurait pu l\u2019\u00eatre pour toute autre marchandise dans un commerce diff\u00e9rent; Rogers agissait, en tout cela, comme un commis charg\u00e9 d\u2019aller chercher cette marchandise; la banque savait chaque fois, par les t\u00e9l\u00e9phones qu\u2019elle recevait de la compagnie, que Rogers allait chercher cette marchandise.\nThe bank should not be held responsible for the misappropriation by Rogers of the drafts sold to the company more than, in the case suggested by Mr. Justice Bernier, the merchant would be if Rogers, after having obtained delivery of the goods, had run away with them.\nMoreover, that the company never looked upon the resolution as governing its requisitions for foreign drafts is established by its course of dealing. So far from relying, for its protection against what happened, upon the assurance that, by force of the resolution, the requisition notes ought to have been signed by two of the persons named, the company, as shown by the evidence, did not even know that requisition notes were part of the procedure to obtain the drafts. Mr. Dettmers testified to that. He said:\nAs far as I am aware, we never made out any of those requisitions. Our method was simply to telephone to the bank and inquire regarding the rate of exchange, and then advise them whatever drafts were required. This is complete evidence that the company never expected the bank to regard the requisition notes as coming within the scope of the resolution or the resolution as having any bearing upon the request for foreign drafts. The requisition notes were no part of the method adopted by the company. So far as it was concerned, they might as well have been dispensed with. In fact, they were nothing more than an incident in the routine work of the bank. But the company made it understood that the cheques, properly signed, were intended to be debited to its account for the purchase of remittances, that they left it to Rogers to arrange for and obtain the remittances and, in the words of Mr. G. C. Pratt, the accountant for the bank, \u201cthe mere fact that he brought the cheques would be a credential.\u201d\nI have for those reasons, come to the conclusion that the action was properly dismissed and that the judgment of the courts below ought to be confirmed. This makes it unnecessary to examine whether, under different circumstances, the company would nevertheless have been precluded from recovering both on account of its own negligence as well as on account of the experience \u201cof the previous years which had passed unchallenged\u201d\u2014two points in respect of which much could be said on behalf of the bank.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Mann & Mackinnon.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Meredith, Holden, Heward & Holden.\n[1] [1926] A.C., 737, at p. 742.\n[2] [1910] A.C., 174, at p. 184.\n[3] (1851) 10 C.B. 665.\n[4] [1906] A.C. 439.\n[5] [1920] A.C. 683, at p. 688.\n[6] [1927] A.C. 318.\n",

Avenue Realty Company ((1912) 46 Can. S.C.R. 589) distinguished.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, Weir J.[1], and dismissing the appellant\u2019s action.\nThe appellant sought by his action to have the respondent condemned to reconstruct, at his own expense, a wall situated on the boundary line between their respective properties, alleging that it was a party wall and was leaning towards the respondent\u2019s property owing to the fact that the latter\u2019s house was not properly underpropped. The respondent, in his plea, besides alleging that the wall was his own wall and not a party wall, denied the allegations of the statement of claim. The appellant, in his answer, alleged that he had been using that wall to support his house for a period extending over thirty years and that he had acquired a party right by way of prescription; and the respondent filed an inscription in law against this last allegation.\nThe facts, as found by the appellate court, are as follows: the wall is one of the four walls of the respondent\u2019s house; this house, built before that of the appellant, is faced with stone and its three other sides are solid brick; the three outside walls of the appellant\u2019s house are of lumber covered with brick, while on the side next to respondent\u2019s property, the wall is merely a stud-work covered with laths and mortar, the two houses being therefore connected, not by one wall only, but by a wall and a stud-work. If the wall had been straight, the appellant\u2019s house would not have been exposed to wind and weather; but, owing to the opening resulting from the leaning of the wall, the appellant\u2019s house was damaged by exposure from wind and rain.\nThe appellate court held that the leaning of the wall was apparently caused, upon the evidence, not by a fault of the respondent, but by the unsettled condition of the soil; that, under these circumstances, the reconstruction of the wall, if necessary and on the assumption that it was a party wall, could be ordered only at the expense of both parties (Art. 512 C.C.); and, without deciding whether the wall was a party wall or not, the appellate court maintained the judgment of the trial judge dismissing the appellant\u2019s action, on the ground that it could not order the reconstruction of the wall at the joint expense of both owners as such judgment would be ultra petita.\nP.

There the view of the majority of the Court was that, having regard to the circumstances in which the respondents had taken possession of part of the appellant\u2019s wall, and to the manner in which they had used it, they were precluded from denying that they had done so with \u201cla volont\u00e9 d\u2019en acqu\u00e9rir la mitoyennet\u00e9.\u201d\nThe present appellant, upon the evidence, can only charge the respondent and his predecessors with a neighbourly tolerance of his own very slight acts of trespass.

They entered into a contract in writing with the builders, now defendants, Boileau and Cordeau, for the construction of nine duplex houses (one detached and the other eight semi-detached) on the above mentioned lots. The plan prepared by the architect shewed that each house should be wholly situate on one of the subdivision lots. The builders made arrangements with the respondent company for the purchase of materials to be used in the construction of these houses and obtained materials from it to the amount of $18,288.53. Before the builders had completed their contract, the appellants became bankrupt and trustees in bankruptcy were appointed; as a result, the builders were also compelled to make an assignment and a trustee was appointed. Before the completion of the last house, the respondent, to preserve the privilege given by law to a supplier of materials, registered against the above mentioned lands its account for all the materials supplied to the builders for the construction of the nine houses, showing a balance of $12,193.30 still unpaid; and within three months thereafter the respondent brought action against the builders personally and their trustee in bankruptcy and impleaded the appellants (mis-en-cause) as owners of the property burdened with the privilege and also their trustees in bankruptcy.\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed from, that the respondent was not entitled to claim any privilege as supplier of materials. His notice of registration had not been given in conformity with the enactments of the civil code, if one considers the provisions which give to the supplier of materials a privilege on the immovable of the proprietor on whose lot or lots a building is erected (art. 2013e C.C.) in conjunction with the provisions of the law relating to the registration of titles to land according to the cadastral numbers of the lots into which it is subdivided (art. 2167-8 C.C.). Munn & Shea Limited v. Hogue Limit\u00e9e ([1928] S.C.R. 398) discussed and distinguished.\nThe principle laid, down in that case that a supplier of materials may register, under certain circumstances, a single privilege for the full amount of his claim against several lots as a whole, must be limited, in its application to the present case, to each pair of semi-detached houses, i.e., the respondent here, provided he registered a proper memorial, was entitled to a privilege on each pair of semi-detached houses for the unpaid price of its materials entering into the construction of each pair respectively; but it was not entitled to a single privilege on all the lots and houses for the balance of its claim for materials supplied which entered into the different buildings erected on the nine lots.\nHeld, also, that the respondent was not obliged to obtain leave of the bankruptcy court (s. 24 of the Bankruptcy Act) before taking its action against the appellants (owners of the lots), as the present proceedings so far as they relate to the enforcement of the privilege against the appellants\u2019 immovable are not proceedings \u201cagainst the property or person of the debtor,\u201d the defendants being in this case the \u201cdebtors.\u201d The fact that judgment has been irregularly rendered against the \u201cdebtors\u201d defendants without leave of the court does not constitute a defence by the appellants to the enforcement of the privilege.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, Panneton J., and maintaining the respondent\u2019s action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nT. Brosseau K.C. for the appellant.\nE. Lafleur K.C. and J. F. Chisholm for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nLamont J.\u2014In January, 1927, the appellants, Henri Gadbois and H. L. Coll\u00e9, were carrying on business together in Montreal under the firm name of Duplex Construction Company, and were owners of subdivisions 185 to 193, inclusive, of lot 37, according to the official plan and book of reference of the municipality of the parish of Montreal. On January 7, 1927, they entered into a contract in writing with Armand Boileau and J. B. Cordeau (hereinafter called the \u201cbuilders\u201d), for the construction of nine duplex houses (one detached and the other eight semi-detached) on the above mentioned land. Article 1 of the contract reads as follows:\u2014 Article 1. L\u2019entrepreneur fournira tous les mat\u00e9riaux et ex\u00e9cutera tous les ouvrages indiqu\u00e9s sur les dessins ou mentionn\u00e9s dans les devis prepares par Cajetan Dufort (ci-apr\u00e8s nomm\u00e9 l\u2019architecte) pour la construction et finition de neuf duplex, lesquels dessins et devis sont identifies par la signature des parties ci-contre et font partie de ce contrat.\nThe plan shewed that each house should be wholly situate on one of the subdivision lots and was to cost $16,000, except the detached house for which an additional sum was to be paid. The builders made arrangements with the respondent for the purchase of materials to be used in the construction of these houses, and, on February 9, 1927, the respondent notified the appellants, in accordance with Art. 2013 (e) of the Civil Code, as enacted by 7 Geo. V (1916), c. 52, and, in its amended form, as enacted by 14 Geo. V (1924), c. 73, that it had contracted with the builders to furnish materials \u201cto the extent of $10,000\u201d for the construction of buildings on the lands above mentioned owned by them. This notice was received and accepted by the appellants. The builders proceeded to erect the houses and, after February 9, obtained materials from the respondent therefor to the amount of $18,258.53. Before the builders had completed their contract the appellants became bankrupt and J. E. Beaudin and N. Grobstein were appointed their trustees in bankruptcy. As a result of the bankruptcy of the appellants the builders were compelled to make an assignment in bankruptcy, and one Turcotte was appointed their trustee. As the houses were not finished when both the appellants and the builders became bankrupt, Beaudin and Grobstein, in their capacity as trustees, obtained from the respondent a further supply of materials, amounting to $887.55, to complete the buildings. On November 28, 1927, the respondent, to preserve the privilege given by the statute to a supplier of materials, registered against the above mentioned lands its account for material supplied to the builders, with the amounts paid thereon, which shewed a balance of $11,305.75 still unpaid. It also registered its account for $887.55 for material supplied to the trustees in bankruptcy. These registrations were made before the completion of the last house, and, within three months thereafter, the respondent brought action against the builders personally, and their trustee in bankruptcy, for $12,193.30, and impleaded the appellants (mis-en-cause) as owners of the property burdened with the privilege and also their trustees in bankruptcy. Neither the builders nor their trustee appeared to the action, but the appellants, as well as their trustees, contested the respondent\u2019s claim. The trial judge gave judgment in favour of the respondent, holding that it was entitled to a privilege as claimed, to the extent of $7,000. This judgment was affirmed by the Court of King\u2019s Bench, although two judges thereof were of opinion that the amount for which the respondent was entitled to a privilege was only $2,709.44. From the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench the mis-en-cause appeal to this court.\nBefore dealing with the main grounds of appeal I will refer to certain objections to the procedure taken on behalf of the appellants. The first objection was, that, as both the appellants and the builders were in bankruptcy, the leave of the court should have been obtained before commencing proceedings and that in the absence of such leave all the proceedings were null and void. Section 24 of the Bankruptcy Act (formerly Art. 8 (B)) in part reads as follows:\u2014\n24. On the making of a receiving order or authorized assignment, no creditor to whom the debtor is indebted in respect of any debt provable in bankruptcy shall have any remedy against the property or person of the debtor or shall commence or continue any action, execution or other proceedings for the recovery of a debt provable in bankruptcy unless with the leave of the court and on such terms as the court may impose.\nI am unable to find anything in this section to support the appellants\u2019 objection. Under the section it is only when proceedings are brought against the person or property of the debtor for a debt provable in bankruptcy, that the leave of the court must first be obtained. The present proceedings so far as they relate to the enforcement of the privilege against the appellants\u2019 immovable are not proceedings against the property or person of the debtor. In this case it is the builders who occupy the position of debtor. It is true that in these proceedings personal judgment was given against the builders. This, in my opinion, should not have been given without the leave of the court, but that is not a matter in which the appellants have any interest, nor does it constitute a defence to the enforcement of the privilege. Making the debtor a party simply for the purpose of enforcing the privilege against the appellants\u2019 immovable does not, in my opinion, contravene s. 24 above cited. Another objection taken was that the memorial as registered was illegal because it was not a statement of the respondent\u2019s account of materials supplied for the houses in question, but a copy of its current account with the builders, which commenced at a period prior to February 9, 1927, and included materials not furnished for the construction of the buildings upon the appellants\u2019 land.\nThe code requires the memorial registered to specify \u201cthe nature and price of the materials supplied\u201d to the builder, and such materials are all that should be set out in the memorial. If, however, materials are included in the account which should not have been included and for the price of which a court would not decree a privilege, how can that invalidate the memorial or its registration? At the hearing the secretary of the respondent company checked over the accounts and testified as to the materials which were delivered for the construction of the buildings in question, and the payments applicable thereto. This put the court in possession of the facts necessary to enable it to determine the amount for which the respondent should have a privilege provided all the materials furnished by it for the construction of the buildings entered into them. There is, in my opinion, no substance in this objection.\nThe two substantial grounds of appeal are: (1) That the appellants\u2019 contract with the builders was for the construction of nine houses, each house to be on a separate and distinct lot with a separate price fixed for each; that each lot, with the house thereon, constituted a separate immovable and, therefore, the right of the respondent to a privilege for materials supplied was a privilege against each separate immovable and was limited in amount to the price of the materials furnished by the respondent which were incorporated in each house respectively.\n(2) That if the respondent was entitled to claim a privilege on all the houses and lots as one immovable, it had failed to establish the quantity of materials supplied by it which had entered into the construction of the houses.\nIn answer to the first of the above grounds of appeal the respondent cited the case of Munn & Shea, Ltd. v. Hogue Limit\u00e9e[1], which was affirmed by this court[2]. That case, it was contended, governed the case at bar and conclusively established the respondent\u2019s right to a single privilege covering the nine lots. In that case one Davis being the owner of twelve lots decided to erect thereon thirteen houses. He applied to Hogue Limit\u00e9e to supply him with the materials necessary therefor. This that company agreed to do. Nothing was said as to any part of the materials being allocated to any particular house. Materials were furnished to the amount of over $11,000 and incorporated into the thirteen houses, but no account was kept of the amount which entered into the construction of each house. Davis paid Hogue Limit\u00e9e for all materials supplied by it with the exception of $3,643. For that sum the company registered a privilege against five of the lots with the houses thereon. These five houses had, while in course of construction but before the registration of the claim of privilege, been sold by Davis to Munn & Shea, Ltd. In that case, as in the one now before us, it was argued that it was illegal to register a privilege for the full amount of the claim against all the lots as a whole. This argument was rejected in all courts and Hogue Limit\u00e9e was held entitled to claim a privilege on the five lots. The ground upon which the decision is based is stated by Lafontaine C.J. in his judgment in the Court of King\u2019s Bench, as follows:\u2014\nComme on l\u2019a vu, le d\u00e9fendeur la donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e une commande du bois n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 la construction de 13 maisons \u00e9rig\u00e9es sur 12 lots sans sp\u00e9cifier aucune des maisons ou aucun lot en particulier et sans faire la division des mat\u00e9riaux pour chacune des maisons ou chacun des lots. Le d\u00e9biteur n\u2019avait qu\u2019un chantier et l\u2019intim\u00e9e a livr\u00e9 ses mat\u00e9riaux \u00e0 l\u2019endroit qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 indiqu\u00e9. En sorte que le d\u00e9fendeur a donc, lui-m\u00eame consid\u00e9r\u00e9 ses 12 lots comme ne faisant qu\u2019un seul immeuble et il serait bien difficile sinon impossible \u00e0 un fournisseur de mat\u00e9riaux d\u2019indiquer la quantit\u00e9 et l\u2019esp\u00e8ce de mat\u00e9riaux entr\u00e9s dans la construction de chacune des maisons construites par le d\u00e9fendeur. Comme de sa nature le privil\u00e8ge est indivisible et qu\u2019il garantit la cr\u00e9ance toute enti\u00e8re, il s\u2019en suit que le privil\u00e8ge de l\u2019intim\u00e9e porte sur les 12 lote compris comme un tout et, par cons\u00e9quent, sur chacun d\u2019eux.\nIn this court all the judges who heard the appeal were satisfied on the argument that Hogue Limit\u00e9e was entitled to a single privilege on the lots claimed. This was expressed in the written judgment by the words\nthere seems to be no ground for disagreeing with the views of the Court of King\u2019s Bench.\nIt was not our intention by that observation to indicate that w\u00e9 accepted every expression which had been used in that case in the broadest sense of which it is capable, but that we accepted the conclusion of the court, and the principle of the decision as involved in that conclusion; the reasoning, in other words, as applied to the circumstances of that case. It remains now to apply that decision and to determine whether or not it governs the case at bar.\nFor the appellants it was contended that it was distinguishable: (a) Because in that case it was the owner of the lots who contracted for the materials; whereas in the present case it was the builders who contracted with the respondent, and a representation by the builders that they were to be used in the construction of nine houses for the appellants was not evidence that the appellants were treating the land on which they were to be erected as a single parcel or tract.\n(b) That in the former case the owner was erecting thirteen houses on twelve lots, which shewed clearly that he was not using each lot as a distinct and separate immovable; whereas in the present case each house was to be erected on a separate lot with a separate price fixed for each.\nArt. 2013 (e) C.C. gives to the supplier of materials a privilege on the immovable in the construction of which the materials supplied to the proprietor or builder have been used. Under the Code the privilege attaches when the materials are supplied to the builder to the same extent as it does when they are supplied to the proprietor, but when the materials are contracted for by the builder the person supplying them must notify the proprietor that he has contracted with the builder for the delivery of the materials. The respondent in the present case having delivered materials to the builders in accordance with its contract and having given to the proprietor the notice required by the code, was entitled to a privilege against the proprietor\u2019s immovable to the same extent as if the proprietor himself has contracted for the materials.\nThen as to each house erected on a separate lot constituting a separate immovable:\nArt. 2013 C.C. reads as follows:\n2013. The workman, supplier of materials, builder and architect have a privilege and a right of preference over all the other creditors on the immovable, but only upon the additional value given to such immovable by the work done or by the materials.\nThe word \u201cimmovable\u201d here means the premises to which additional value is given by the work done or the materials used. That is the land and any building erected thereon forming in law a part thereof. (Art. 376 C.C.) When the building is erected, as it is attached to and forms part of the land, the privilege covers both land and building, but is limited in amount to the additional value given to the land by the materials used in the building. How much land shall be considered as constituting one immovable depends upon the quantity allotted to it by the proprietor. This in practice is, speaking generally, largely determined by the character of the building to be erected. The subdividing of a piece of land into lots and the registration of a plan thereof which gives each lot its own distinctive number is some evidence that the owner will thereafter consider\u2014as the law certainly considers (art. 2167-8 C.C.)\u2014each lot as a separate parcel, and the same conclusion might be drawn where a man acquires lots according to a registered plan of subdivision. The fact, however, remains that notwithstanding the subdividing of a piece of land and the registration of a plan thereof, the owner of contiguous lots may, for building purposes, use two or more of them as one parcel or tract, in which case a row of connected houses on these lots may properly be regarded as one structure or, with the lots, one immovable, as was decided in the Munn & Shea case[3].\nIf nothing more appears than that a proprietor has built, or caused to be built, a house or other building upon a piece of land which comprises a single lot according to a registered plan, prima facie the boundaries of the lot would be the boundaries of the immovable. Where, however, as in the case before us, the proprietor of a number of contiguous lots erects thereon a number of buildings, the question is: What constitutes the immovable on which a privilege for materials supplied and used will attach? The answer furnished by the Munn & Shea case3 is: \u201cSuch lot or lots as the proprietor for building purposes uses as one parcel or tract.\u201d In that case, however, the court was not dealing with buildings entirely unconnected with each other and erected wholly upon individual lots. It was there not called upon to determine the character of the evidence which in such a case would be required to establish that the proprietor was, for building purposes, using two or more contiguous lots as one parcel. There the evidence shewed that the proprietor was building thirteen houses on twelve lots. The houses were all physically joined together and anyone could see at a glance that he was really erecting only one structure. If an intending purchaser of one of the houses had looked at the house it would have been apparent to him that it was physically connected with the house on either side, and he would thus have been put upon his guard to make inquiries as to the privileges against which he must protect himself in case he purchased.\nIn the present case we have no such evidence. Here we have proprietors who cause to be erected on their nine lots a central house situated wholly on one lot and entirely separate from the adjoining houses. Then we have two pairs of semi-detached houses, each pair wholly erected on two lots and entirely separate from the next pair which also occupies two lots. Under these circumstances can it reasonably be said that the proprietors were using their nine lots as one parcel or tract for building purposes, simply because they made a contract for the erection of nine houses thereon according to a plan which shews that each house is to occupy only one lot? In other words was the making of one contract for all the buildings they intended to erect on the lots sufficient to establish the user by them of the nine lots as one parcel, or must there be on the lots themselves some evidence that they are being used as a single tract for one structure, to justify the application of the principle laid down in the Munn & Shea case?[4].\nIn determining this question regard must be had to the provisions of the law relating to the registration of titles to land according to the cadastral numbers of the lots into which it is subdivided, as well as to the provisions which give to the supplier of materials a privilege on the immovable of the proprietor on whose lot or lots a building is erected. The registration provisions are designed to maintain security of title. The provisions relating to a right of privilege are designed to give a supplier of materials security on the immovable of the proprietor although they do not define just what in each case shall constitute the immovable on which security is given. The privilege provisions of the code and in particular those which provide for a privilege without registration until the expiration of thirty days after the completion of the building, constitute an invasion of the strict principle of the registration provisions. The precise extent of that invasion may, in particular cases, be a nice question. We may, however, I think, start with this, that the legislature did not intend the privilege provisions of the code to invade the principle of the registration provisions beyond what was necessary to give effect to the privilege that was being granted, which privilege was intended to be a real protection and to be capable of being successfully worked out in practice. From the fact that the privilege is effectively constituted without registration at the date when the obligation of the proprietor or contractor arises[5], and continues to be effective without registration until thirty days after the completion of the building (provided the materials supplied have been used therein) I think the inference may reasonably be drawn that the legislature did not apprehend that, in the absence of anything on the register, anyone during that period would be misled into believing that no privilege attached. The reason for not requiring notice to be given by means of the register to intending purchasers, or others desiring to acquire an interest in the immovable, must, in my opinion, have been that notice by registration was considered unnecessary in view of the notice furnished by a building under construction or newly completed on the land sought to be dealt with. Anyone proposing to deal with such land would know, or would be presumed to know that privileges might attach thereto. Giving full effect, therefore, to the privilege which the code gives to a supplier of materials, I am of opinion that the evidence necessary to justify the conclusion that a proprietor is using a number of contiguous lots as one parcel for building purposes must be so open and visible that anyone viewing the premises would see thereon sufficient to indicate to an ordinary man the likelihood or probability that the lots were being used as a single parcel. The prima facie inference that each separate building with the lot or lots on which it stands is an immovable in itself, must be displaced by something sufficient to put an ordinary man, be he a supplier of materials or an intending purchaser, on inquiry to ascertain if, for building purposes, the lots were being used as a single parcel to which would attach a single privilege for the price of materials used in any building erected thereon.\nIn the present case I fail to find on the premises anything which, in my opinion, would be sufficient to bring home to the mind of a supplier of materials, or an intending purchaser, the likelihood or probability that the appellants for building purposes were using the nine lots as one parcel. Only the semi-detached houses are physically connected and have the appearance of being one structure. Anyone looking at the centre house would conclude that it with the lot on which it stood constituted a separate immovable. He would also conclude that each pair of semi-detached houses with the ground belonging to them, according to the registered plan, was likewise an immovable within the meaning of art. 2013 C.C. In my opinion, therefore, the application of the principle laid down in the Munn & Shea case[6] must be limited in the case at bar, to each pair of semi-detached houses. That is to say, the respondent here, provided he registered a proper memorial, was entitled to a privilege on the detached house for the unpaid price of the material supplied by it which entered into the construction of that house. It was also entitled to a privilege on each pair of semi-detached houses for the unpaid price of its materials entering into the construction of each pair respectively. But it was not entitled to a single privilege on all the lots and houses for the balance of its claim for materials supplied which entered into the different buildings erected on the nine lots.\nThe respondent not being entitled to a single privilege on the nine lots, is its registered memorial sufficient to support a privilege on any one of the immovables against which it might elect to proceed? It may be that it is, but we are not called upon in this case to decide that question. Before a privilege can be decreed against any one of the appellants\u2019 immovables the respondent must establish the price of its materials which went into that immovable. That has not been done with respect to any one of the immovables. For the respondent it was argued that if the appellants\u2019 contention prevailed it would cast upon a supplier of materials the task of keeping a specific tally of the quantity of its various materials used in the construction of each separate building and that, under modern conditions, this task was an impossible one. That may indeed be so, but it must be borne in mind that the right to a privilege for material supplied and used in the construction of a building is purely a statutory right and extends only as far as the legislature has seen fit to grant it. Whether a more extensive right should be granted is a matter for the consideration of the legislature but not for the courts.\nI would allow the appeal with costs and disallow the respondent\u2019s claim.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Brosseau & Brosseau.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Lafleur, MacDougall, Macfarlane & Barclay.\n[1] (1927) Q.O.R. 44 K.B. 198.\n[2] [1928] S.C.R. 398.\n[3] [1928] S.C.R. 398.\n3 [1928] S.C.R. 398.\n[4] [1928] S.C.R. 398.\n[5] [1928] S.C.R. 398.\n[6] [1928] S.C.R. 398.\n",

Arts. 469, 495, 1248 C.C.P.\nAPPEAL by the defendant appellant from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, Duclos J., and ordering a new trial.\nThe plaintiff (respondent), the widow of one Charles Quirion, claimed compensation for the death of her husband, caused, as she alleged, by the defendant ((appellant) company\u2019s negligence. He was struck by one of the company\u2019s tram cars while attempting to cross its tracks in Montreal, and thereby received injuries from which he died soon after. At the trial, which took place before Duclos J. and a special jury, the plaintiff presented her case, and the defendant then moved that the case be withdrawn from the jury and that the action be dismissed, upon the ground that the plaintiff had introduced no evidence upon which the jury could find a verdict. The Court granted this motion. The plaintiff appealed to the Court of King\u2019s Bench, which was unanimous in the view that there was evidence to go to the jury. But the order for a new trial, as framed by the appellate court, directed\nque la cause soit remise devant le tribunal de premi\u00e8re instance dans l\u2019\u00e9tat o\u00f9 elle se trouvait, au moment o\u00f9 la susdite motion a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite, et pour qu\u2019il soit proc\u00e9d\u00e9 suivant la loi.\nA.

Lanctot for the respondent.\nThe Supreme Court of Canada upheld the view of the judges of the appellate court that the trial judge erred in withdrawing the case from the jury and in dismissing the action, and that there was evidence which he should have submitted for the jury\u2019s consideration; and the appeal was dismissed with costs. But the court added that \u201ca question arose at the argument as to the form of the order\u201d for a new trial as made by the appellate court, and \u201cattention was directed to the difficulty of continuing the proceedings before the tribunal of first instance in the state in which (they were) when the defendant company launched its motion. In order to comply (with such order), it would seem necessary to resume the proceedings before the judge, and with the special jury, who functioned on the former occasion, and it would be inconvenient, or perhaps impossible, to satisfy these requirements, the judgment at the trial having been given more than a year ago.\u201d This Court therefore varied the judgment appealed from \u201cby substituting for the clause (above) quoted a direction to the effect that a new trial shall be had between the parties.\u201d\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Perron, Vall\u00e9e & Perron.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Lanctot & Hamelin.\n[1] (1928) Q.O.R. 45 K.B. 521.\n",

Dugas (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nOscar Amiot and Others (Mis-en-cause) Respondents.\n1929: May 20, 21; 1929: June 13\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Mignault, Rinfret and Lamont JJ.\nAPPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING\u2019S BENCH APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nWill\u2014Probate\u2014Validity\u2014Onus probandi\u2014Res judicata\u2014Object and effect of probate\u2014Requ\u00eate civile\u2014Arts. 857 and 858 C.C.\u2014Art. 1177 C.C.P.\nIn an action in contestation of a holograph will which had been probated, the burden of proof still lies upon the beneficiary to establish the genuineness of the writing or of the signature of the testator, the probate not having the effect of shifting to the party repudiating the will the burden of proving that the writing or the signature were forged.\nThe judgment ordering the probate of a holograph will does not constitute res judicata. The main object of the probate is to give publicity to holograph wills and to those made in the form derived from the laws of England; and the practical effect of the probate is to enable \u201cparties interested\u201d to \u201cobtain certified copies of the will * * * which are authentic.\u201d Then the will takes effect \u201cuntil it is set aside upon contestation\u201d (Art. 857 C.C.).\nSemble that, in the absence of Art. 858 C.C., a requ\u00eate civile would have been a proper remedy to attack the validity of the probate now in question (Art. 1177 C.C.P., par. 6); but Art. 808 C.C. entitled the respondents to do it by way of defence to an action taken by the appellant to enforce the probate.\nJudgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Q.O.R. 45 K.B. 85) aff.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1] reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, at Montreal, Mercier J., and dismissing the appellant\u2019s action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the judgment now reported.\nS. Poulin K.C. for the appellant.\nA. Duranleau K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014L\u2019appelante, Dame Georgiana E. Dugas (Madame Wilbrod Thivierge), poursuit pour la somme de $7,000 l\u2019ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire de feue Dame Marie- Louise Amiot en vertu d\u2019un codicille olographe en date du 11 septembre 1922, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 le 4 mai 1926 et qui se lit comme suit:\nMontr\u00e9al, 11 septembre 1922.\nEn ce onzi\u00e8me jour de septembre mil neuf cent vingt-deux, moi Marie-Louise Amiot en pr\u00e9sence de ma s\u0153ur Ev\u00e9lina, je l\u00e8gue \u00e0 notre fille adoptive Georgiana (Dame Wilbrod Thivierge) la somme de $7,000 sept mille dollars qu\u2019elle touchera apr\u00e8s la mort de ma dite s\u0153ur Ev\u00e9lina.\nSign\u00e9: MARIE-LOUISE AMIOT\nEVELINA AMIOT\nL\u2019ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire s\u2019en est rapport\u00e9 \u00e0 justice; mais les l\u00e9gataires, en vertu d\u2019un testament ant\u00e9rieur dat\u00e9 du 11 f\u00e9vrier 1896, ont contest\u00e9 le codicille en niant qu\u2019il fut \u00e9crit et sign\u00e9 par la testatrice.\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a maintenu l\u2019action; et la Cour du Banc du Roi l\u2019a rejet\u00e9e, mais seulement \u00e0 une majorit\u00e9 de trois juges contre deux. Les questions en litige ont donc donn\u00e9 lieu jusqu\u2019ici \u00e0 une division \u00e9gale d\u2019opinion, et l\u2019on voit par l\u00e0 qu\u2019elles ne sont pas sans pr\u00e9senter des difficult\u00e9s tr\u00e8s s\u00e9rieuses. Ces difficult\u00e9s proviennent en premier lieu d\u2019une divergence de vues sur les faits, mais \u00e9galement d\u2019une divergence de vues sur le droit.\nApr\u00e8s l\u2019examen le plus attentif et le plus minutieux, nous sommes arriv\u00e9s \u00e0 la conclusion que le r\u00e9sultat de la cause d\u00e9pendait de la solution de la question de droit.\nA l\u2019\u00e2ge de neuf ans, l\u2019appelante a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e par Marie-Louise Amiot, qui \u00e9tait c\u00e9libataire. Elle demeura avec elle jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de vingt-trois ans. Elle se maria, passa encore deux ans chez la testatrice, puis alla demeurer \u00e0 lberville. Cette ville est \u00e0 une courte distance de Montr\u00e9al o\u00f9 r\u00e9sidait la testatrice.\nL\u2019appelante resta sept ans sans aller voir sa bienfaitrice. Elle nous dit cependant que cette derni\u00e8re lui envoyait\ndes mandats presque tous les quinze jours * * * des mandats de trois piastres tous les quinze jours * * * Elle a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 me prot\u00e9ger.\nLe 11 septembre 1922 l\u2019appelante vint \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al. Les raisons de ce voyage ne sont nullement donn\u00e9es dans la preuve. Mademoiselle Amiot \u00e9tait alors malade. Le fait est qu\u2019elle est morte trois mois apr\u00e8s. L\u2019appelante ne nous dit pas qu\u2019elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9e par Mademoiselle Amiot, ou qu\u2019elle fut induite \u00e0 faire le voyage \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al parce que Mademoiselle Amiot \u00e9tait malade, ou m\u00eame qu\u2019elle savait alors que Mademoiselle Amiot \u00e9tait malade. Elle dit simplement ceci:\nEn septembre 1922; c\u2019est la servante qui m\u2019a ouvert la porte; je suis entr\u00e9e le 11 septembre 1922 pour voir les demoiselles (Mlle Amiot vivait avec sa s\u0153ur Ev\u00e9lina, \u00e9galement c\u00e9libataire) parce qu\u2019elles avaient exprim\u00e9 le d\u00e9sir qu\u2019elles voulaient me voir souvent; elles m\u2019aimaient et je les aimais. C\u2019est l\u00e0 qu\u2019elle m\u2019a donn\u00e9 le codicille.\nCette unique explication du voyage est plut\u00f4t curieuse, puisque, de son propre aveu, l\u2019appelante n\u2019\u00e9tait pas all\u00e9e \u201cvoir les demoiselles\u201d depuis sept ans. C\u2019est en cette circonstance que le codicille aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crit et que Mademoiselle Amiot l\u2019aurait remis \u00e0 l\u2019appelante. Mais il vaut mieux laisser parler cette derni\u00e8re elle-m\u00eame dans son langage plut\u00f4t d\u00e9cousu:\nQ. Racontez donc \u00e0 la cour ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9?\nR. Elle \u00e9tait malade. C\u2019est sa s\u0153ur Mademoiselle Ev\u00e9lina, a aid\u00e9 \u00e0 se soulever dans le lit, et Mademoiselle Lyman. Elles sont mortes toutes les deux, aujourd hui.\nQ. Mademoiselle Ev\u00e9lina et Mademoiselle Lyman sont mortes, aujourd hui?\nR. Oui, monsieur, \u00e0 trois semaines d\u2019intervalle.\nQ. Qu\u2019est-ce qu\u2019elle vous a dit, Marie-Louise?\nR. Elle m\u2019a donn\u00e9 le codicille et elle m\u2019a dit de ne pas en parler \u00e0 personne pour ne pas qu\u2019Ev\u00e9lina ait du trouble, parce que \u00e7a allait mal dans la famille. D\u2019abord, c\u2019\u00e9tait payable apr\u00e8s la mort d\u2019Ev\u00e9lina. C\u2019est pour cela qu\u2019elle m\u2019a dit de ne pas en parler, parce que c\u2019\u00e9tait certain qu\u2019elle aurait eu beaucoup de trouble. Marie-Louise m\u2019aimait beaucoup.\n* * *\nElle a \u00e9crit devant moi.\nQ. Qu\u2019est-ce qu\u2019elle vous a dit avant d\u2019\u00e9crire?\nR. Elle m\u2019a dit qu\u2019elle m\u2019avait promis de me donner quelque chose: \u201cJe tiens ma promesse.\u201d\nQ. Comment s\u2019y est-elle prise pour \u00e9crire?\nR. C\u2019est mademoiselle Lyman qui a apport\u00e9 les effets qu\u2019il fallait: une petite planchette; elle a mis une feuille de tablette et Marie-Louise a \u00e9crit. Elle \u00e9tait malade; elle s\u2019est repos\u00e9e un peu; elle \u00e9tait bien malade.\nQ. Vous parlez du codicille?\nR. Oui, monsieur.\nQ. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crit devant vous?\nR. Devant moi, par mademoiselle Marie-Louise Amiot.\nQ. A-t-il \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crit \u00e0 l\u2019encre?\nR. A l\u2019encre, devant moi.\nQ. Apr\u00e8s l\u2019avoir \u00e9crit elle l\u2019a sign\u00e9?\nR. Elle l\u2019a sign\u00e9.\nQ. Et elle vous l\u2019a remis?\nR. Elle me l\u2019a remis. C\u2019est l\u00e0 qu\u2019elle m\u2019a dit: \u201cJ\u2019ai promis de ne pas t\u2019oublier, je ne t\u2019oublie pas.\u201d\n* * * Q. Vous avez trouv\u00e9 Marie-Louise bien malade?\nR. Oui, monsieur, elle \u00e9tait malade trois mois avant sa mort.\nQ. Elle \u00e9tait malade au lit?\nR. Oui, monsieur, au lit; elle \u00e9tait malade, elle m\u2019a bien parl\u00e9 cependant; elle avait beaucoup de peine, je vous assure.\nQ. Et vous dites qu\u2019elle avait de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9crire?\nR. Non, monsieur, elle n\u2019avait pas de difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9crire; elle \u00e9tait bien faible, elle s\u2019est reprise.\nQ. Vous avez constat\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait faible?\nR. Pas faible.\nQ. Elle s\u2019est reprise plusieurs fois?\nR. Elle s\u2019est reprise pour se reposer; quand on est malade, on se repose pour faire quelque chose.\nQ. Combien de fois s\u2019est-elle reprise?\nR. Deux ou trois fois. Je l\u2019ai dit une fois, c\u2019est assez.\n* * *\nQ. A qui le document a-t-il \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9, en premier lieu?\nR. Marie-Louise l\u2019a remis \u00e0 Ev\u00e9lina; elle l\u2019a pli\u00e9 devant moi et me l\u2019a remis.\n* * *\nQ. D\u2019apr\u00e8s votre d\u00e9claration, je comprends que mademoiselle Lyman se serait mise d\u2019un c\u00f4t\u00e9 du lit et Ev\u00e9lina de l\u2019autre pour soulever Marie-Louise et lui permettre de s\u2019asseoir dans son lit pour \u00e9crire le document?\nR. Il y en avait seulement qu\u2019une le temps qu\u2019elle a \u00e9crit; l\u2019autre lui donnait ce qu\u2019il fallait pour \u00e9crire. Elles l\u2019ont soulev\u00e9e toutes les deux, apr\u00e8s cela il n\u2019y en avait seulement qu\u2019une qui la soutenait le temps qu\u2019elle a \u00e9crit et l\u2019autre lui donnait ce qu\u2019il fallait en main.\n* * *\nJ\u2019ai dit que Marie-Louise avait \u00e9crit le document, qu\u2019elle l\u2019avait sign\u00e9 et l\u2019avait donn\u00e9 \u00e0 Ev\u00e9lina; Ev\u00e9lina me l\u2019a donn\u00e9 de suite. Je n\u2019ai pas vu \u00e9crire Ev\u00e9lina, Marie-Louise signait souvent Ev\u00e9lina.\n* * *\nJ\u2019ai vu Marie-Louise signer le document; Ev\u00e9lina ne l\u2019a pas sign\u00e9, elle me l\u2019a remis de suite.\nQ. Qu\u2019est-ce que cela veut dire \"de suite\u201d?\nR. Ev\u00e9lina, \u00e7a lui aurait pris bien trop de temps pour signer.\n* * *\nQ. Le document est parti des mains de Marie-Louise et est all\u00e9 dans celles d\u2019Ev\u00e9lina?\nR. Oui, monsieur.\nQ. Et Ev\u00e9lina vous l\u2019a remis sans signer ce qu\u2019il avait dessus?\nR. Non, monsieur.\nQ. Alors, ce n\u2019est pas elle qui a \u00e9crit?\nR. C\u2019est Marie-Louise qui a \u00e9crit; elle a sign\u00e9 probablement le nom d\u2019Ev\u00e9lina, parce qu\u2019Ev\u00e9lina \u00e9tait bien lente \u00e0 \u00e9crire, elle \u00e9tait bien \u00e9nerv\u00e9e.\nQ. Vous \u00eates pr\u00eate \u00e0 jurer qu\u2019Ev\u00e9lina, dont le nom appara\u00eet sur le document, n\u2019a pas elle-m\u00eame sign\u00e9 son nom, l\u00e0?\nR. C\u2019est mademoiselle Marie-Louise qui a sign\u00e9 tout le document.\nQ. Et vous le jurez positivement?\nR. Oui, monsieur.\nNous croyons que les extraits qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent contiennent tout ce qu\u2019elle a dit au cours de son t\u00e9moignage sur l\u00e0 fa\u00e7on dont les choses se seraient pass\u00e9es lorsque le codicille fut \u00e9crit. Ainsi nous en avons le r\u00e9cit de sa propre bouche. Cela est extr\u00eamement important, puisqu\u2019elle est rest\u00e9e le seul t\u00e9moin survivant qui ait pu raconter les faits \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate, Mademoiselle Ev\u00e9lina Amiot, la s\u0153ur de la testatrice, et Mademoiselle Lyman, sa servante, \u00e9tant mortes non seulement avant le proc\u00e8s, mais m\u00eame avant que le codicille ait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 la cour pour fins de v\u00e9rification.\nLe soir du 11 septembre 1922, l\u2019appelante revint \u00e0 Iberville, et voici comment son mari, M. Wilbrod Thivierge, nous raconte son retour:\nQ. Vous rappelez-vous son retour de Montr\u00e9al, il y a quelques ann\u00e9es, alors qu\u2019elle aurait eu en sa possession un document; vous rappelez-vous cette circonstance?\nR. Nous \u00e9tions, moi et Lucien St-Arnaud \u00e0 la maison.\n* * *\nNous \u00e9tions all\u00e9s \u00e0 la gare, au-devant de Madame Thivierge, ma femme. Je lui ai demand\u00e9 si elle avait fait un bon voyage. Elle m\u2019a dit: \u201cOui, j\u2019ai fait un bon voyage.\u201d * * * Alors elle m\u2019a montr\u00e9 le papier, je l\u2019ai lu et l\u2019ai montr\u00e9 \u00e0 M. St-Arnaud.\nQ. Qu\u2019est-ce qu\u2019elle vous a montr\u00e9?\nR. Le document.\nQ. Voulez-vous examiner le document produit en cette cause, \u00e9tant un des feuillets de la pi\u00e8ce P-I, suppos\u00e9 \u00eatre l\u2019original d\u2019un codicille, et dire si c\u2019est ce document qu\u2019elle vous a montr\u00e9?\nR. C\u2019est bien celui-l\u00e0.\nQ. Vous l\u2019avez lu, dans le temps?\nR. Je l\u2019ai lu.\nQ. Vous rappelez-vous l\u2019ann\u00e9e?\nR. Le onze septembre mil neuf cent vingt-deux.\nQ. Qu\u2019est-ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait de ce document?\nR. Nous l\u2019avons serr\u00e9 dans un coffre de s\u00fbret\u00e9.\nQ. Et jusqu\u2019\u00e0 quelle \u00e9poque?\nR. Jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la mort d\u2019Ev\u00e9lina Amiot.\nQ. Qu\u2019est-ce que vous en avez fait ensuite?\nR. Je l\u2019ai donn\u00e9 au notaire Guillet, d\u2019Iberville.\nNous avons omis de reproduire les objections faites par l\u2019avocat des intim\u00e9s et qui ont entrecoup\u00e9 sa d\u00e9position.\nLucien St-Arnaud a affirm\u00e9 se rappeler la circonstance du retour de Madame Thivierge et quelle avait \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 \u201cson codicille\u201d en sa possession. Il avait alors dix-huit ans et son t\u00e9moignage a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu cinq ans apr\u00e8s. Il convient de reproduire cette partie de son contre-interrogatoire:\nQ. Etes-vous parent avec monsieur et madame Thivierge?\nR. Non, monsieur.\nQ. Vous \u00eates intime?\nR. Oui, monsieur. Q. Vous n\u2019avez pas examin\u00e9 le document ce soir-l\u00e0?\nR. Non, monsieur; je ne l\u2019ai pas examin\u00e9; je l\u2019ai vu seulement.\nQ. Vous n\u2019en avez pas pris de photographie?\nR. Non, monsieur.\nQ. Vous n\u2019avez pas pris la forme, les grandeurs?\nR. Non, monsieur.\nQ. On vous l\u2019a pass\u00e9 sous le nez, purement et simplement?\nR. Oui, monsieur.\nQ. Vous n\u2019avez rien vu dessus?\nR. Oui, monsieur.\nQ. Vous n\u2019avez rien vu dessus?\nR. Non, monsieur; seulement, je l\u2019ai vu.\nQ. Vous le reconnaissez?\nR. Oui, monsieur.\nQ. Comment pouvez-vous jurer que vous reconnaissez ce document? C\u2019est un papier carr\u00e9?\nR. Oui, monsieur, je l\u2019ai vu; c\u2019est celui-l\u00e0.\nQ. Vous \u00eates en \u00e9tat de jurer aujourd\u2019hui, sans avoir pris ce que vous avez vu ce soir-l\u00e0?\nR. Oui, monsieur. Q. L\u2019avez-vous regard\u00e9.\nR. Je l\u2019ai regard\u00e9.\nQ. Avez-vous regard\u00e9 du c\u00f4t\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9criture ou bien sur le dos?\nR. Du c\u00f4t\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9criture.\nQ. Etait-il exactement comme aujourd\u2019hui?\nR. Je ne peux pas vous dire, bien juste, je ne l\u2019ai rien que vu en passant, pour moi il est \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s pareil.\nMarie-Louise Amiot d\u00e9c\u00e9da le 12 d\u00e9cembre 1922. Comme nous l\u2019avons vu, elle avait fait son testament devant notaire le 11 f\u00e9vrier 1896, en vertu duquel sa s\u0153ur, Ev\u00e9lina, \u00e9tait institu\u00e9e l\u00e9gataire universelle en usufruit sa vie durant et les intim\u00e9s \u00e9taient constitu\u00e9s l\u00e9gataires en nue-propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Ev\u00e9lina Amiot fit au percepteur du revenu une d\u00e9claration des biens laiss\u00e9s dans la succession de sa s\u0153ur. Cette d\u00e9claration est faite devant notaire. On y trouve que sa s\u0153ur est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e\nayant laiss\u00e9 pour dernier testament non modifi\u00e9 ni r\u00e9voqu\u00e9 celui qu\u2019elle a fait devant Ma\u00eetre Perrault, notaire, le onzi\u00e8me jour du mois de f\u00e9vrier en l\u2019ann\u00e9e mil huit cent quatre-vingt-seize (1896).\nEv\u00e9lina Amiot mourut au mois de mars 1926.,\nMademoiselle Lyman mourut le 2 mai 1926.\nLe codicille fut v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 le 4 mai 1926, par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire de Ma\u00eetre G. Guillet, notaire.\nL\u2019enqu\u00eate ne d\u00e9voile pas si le codicille fut remis \u00e0 Ma\u00eetre Guillet pour lui permettre de pr\u00e9parer les proc\u00e9dures de v\u00e9rification avant la mort de Mademoiselle Lyman. On voit, sur les proc\u00e9dures, que ce notaire demeure \u00e0 Iberville. La v\u00e9rification a eu lieu \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al. Vu la courte distance entre Iberville et Montr\u00e9al, on ne peut conclure n\u00e9cessairement de ce seul fait que le notaire a eu les documents avant le 2 mai.\nLa requ\u00eate pour v\u00e9rification et les affidavits qui l\u2019accompagnaient sont dat\u00e9s du 4 mai. Toutefois, il a fallu le temps de les pr\u00e9parer. On constate maintenant que Mademoiselle Lyman \u00e9tait morte deux jours avant; mais la preuve ne d\u00e9montre pas que lorsque l\u2019appelante alla porter le codicille au notaire Guillet elle savait que Mademoiselle Lyman \u00e9tait morte.\nComme on l\u2019a vu, l\u2019appelante explique pourquoi elle n\u2019aurait pas song\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t \u00e0 faire v\u00e9rifier le codicille. Ce serait parce qu\u2019il ne lui conf\u00e9rait aucun droit tant qu\u2019Ev\u00e9lina Amiot vivait. On peut raisonnablement d\u00e9duire de son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019elle ignorait que la loi exigeait une v\u00e9rification. Comme elle le dit elle-m\u00eame: \u201cLe notaire s\u2019est arrang\u00e9 avec cela.\u201d Son explication vaut plut\u00f4t pour indiquer comment il se fait qu\u2019elle n\u2019en ait pas parl\u00e9 au notaire avant la mort d\u2019Ev\u00e9lina. On n\u2019a pas cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9lucider ce point davantage au cours du contre-interrogatoire.\nPour obtenir la v\u00e9rification du codicille, l\u2019appelante et son mari ont asserment\u00e9 l\u2019affidavit suivant:\nProvince de Qu\u00e9bec.\nDistrict d\u2019Iberville.\nNous soussign\u00e9s, Wilbrod Thivierge et Dame Georgianna Em\u00e9lie Dugas, \u00e9tant d\u00fbment asserment\u00e9s, d\u00e9clarons ce qui suit:\n1\u00b0 Nous avons connu Demoiselles Marie-Louise Amiot et Ev\u00e9lina Amiot, depuis au del\u00e0 de quinze ans; et nous avons eu l\u2019occasion, en maintes circonstances, de les voir \u00e9crire, et de lire leur \u00e9criture;\n2\u00b0 Apr\u00e8s avoir pris connaissance du codicille olographe de ladite Marie-Louise Amiot, dat\u00e9 le 11 septembre 1922, annex\u00e9 aux pr\u00e9sentes, nous sommes en position de d\u00e9clarer, et nous d\u00e9clarons tous deux que ce codicille du onze septembre mil neuf cent vingt-deux, a \u00e9t\u00e9 enti\u00e8rement \u00e9crit et sign\u00e9 de la main de ladite Marie-Louise Amiot, \u00e0 l\u2019exception de la signature \u201cEv\u00e9lina Amiot\u201d qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crite de la main de Demoiselle Ev\u00e9lina Amiot, s\u0153ur de ladite Marie-Louise Amiot.\nEt nous avons sign\u00e9 \u00e0 Iberville, ce quatre de mai mil neuf cent vingt-\nGEORGIANNA DUGAS\nWILBROD THIVIERGE.\nAsserment\u00e9 devant moi, \u00e0 liber-ville, ce quatre mai mil neuf cent vingt-six.\nG. GUILLET, notaire,\nC.C.S.D. d\u2019Iberville.\nCet affidavit est faux sur un point capital. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9 indiscutablement \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate que la signature \u201cEv\u00e9lina Amiot\u201d n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crite de la main de cette derni\u00e8re. L\u2019appelante, du reste, l\u2019a reconnu express\u00e9ment.\nM. Wilbrod Thivierge, l\u2019\u00e9poux de l\u2019appelante, n\u2019a pas jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos d\u2019expliquer, lors de son t\u00e9moignage, pourquoi, afin d\u2019obtenir la v\u00e9rification du codicille, il avait jur\u00e9 que la signature \u201cEv\u00e9lina Amiot\u201d avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crite de sa propre main. Voici comment l\u2019appelante a expliqu\u00e9 la chose, en autant qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait concern\u00e9e:\nQ. Et vous avez d\u00e9clar\u00e9 cela sous votre signature et sous serment, le quatre (mai) mil neuf cent vingt-six (1926) avec votre mari M. Wilbrod Thivierge?\nR. Je n\u2019ai pas d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019Evelina avait sign\u00e9, jamais.\nQ. Est-ce votre signature qu\u2019il y a au bas de l\u2019affidavit accompagnant votre requ\u00eate?\nR. Oui, monsieur; j\u2019ai pu signer sans lire ce qu\u2019il y avait dessus; je n\u2019ai lu aucun papier, cela je peux le dire; je n\u2019ai pas lu le papier, mais j\u2019ai sign\u00e9.\nQ. C\u2019est la seule explication que vous avez \u00e0 donner?\nR. Je peux dire que c\u2019est Marie-Louise qui a fait le codicille.\nQ. Vous pr\u00e9tendez avoir donn\u00e9 un affidavit pour la v\u00e9rification de ce fameux codicille sans avoir pris connaissance de l\u2019affidavit; c\u2019est cela que vous jurez?\nR. J\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 la m\u00eame chose.\nQ. Je vous demande si vous avez asserment\u00e9 l\u2019affidavit accompagnant votre requ\u00eate pour v\u00e9rification sans lire ou vous faire lire l\u2019affidavit par le notaire qui l\u2019a pris?\nR Je ne l\u2019ai pas lu.\nQ. Jurez-vous que le notaire ne vous a pas lu ce document-l\u00e0?\nR. J\u2019avais un jeune b\u00e9b\u00e9 qui \u00e9tait malade \u00e0 ce moment; je ne l\u2019ai pas lu.\nQ. Aviez-vous votre b\u00e9b\u00e9 dans les bras au moment o\u00f9 vous avez sign\u00e9?\nR. Je l\u2019ai donn\u00e9 \u00e0 mon mari pour signer. J\u2019aurais dit la m\u00eame chose que je dis aujourd\u2019hui; je suis certaine de moi.\nQ. Surtout depuis qu\u2019Ev\u00e9lina et mademoiselle Lyman sont d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9es. Vous jurez que vous ne savez pas ce que vous avez sign\u00e9 lorsque vous avez sign\u00e9 l\u2019affidavit en question?\nR. Je jure que Marie-Louise a fait son codicille.\nQ. Vous jurez que vous ne savez pas ce que vous avez sign\u00e9 lorsque vous avez sign\u00e9 l\u2019affidavit en question?\nR. Je ne l\u2019ai pas lu, moi.\nQ. Vous ne savez pas ce que vous avez sign\u00e9?\nR. * * *\nQ. C\u2019est votre signature, cela?\nR. Oui, monsieur.\nQ. Est-ce que le notaire vous a lu l\u2019affidavit?\nR. Il me l\u2019a lu, probablement; il me l\u2019a peut-\u00eatre lu vite; je ne l\u2019ai peut-\u00eatre pas tout compris, parce que j\u2019\u00e9tais occup\u00e9e avec mon enfant dans les bras, je n\u2019\u00e9tais pas assez int\u00e9ress\u00e9e.\nNous avons t\u00e2ch\u00e9 de relater tous les faits que le dossier nous fait conna\u00eetre, en notant \u00e0 mesure, sur le moment m\u00eame, les r\u00e9flexions que chacun de ces faits nous inspirait. Il faut ajouter qu\u2019il y a eu, devant le juge de premi\u00e8re instance, une preuve tr\u00e8s importante par comparaison des \u00e9critures. Les experts entendus \u00e9taient tous des hommes d\u2019exp\u00e9rience. Leurs travaux t\u00e9moignent d\u2019une grande comp\u00e9tence et d\u2019une conscience minutieuse. Ils n\u2019ont rien n\u00e9glig\u00e9 pour faciliter la t\u00e2che des tribunaux. Malheureusement ils n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019accord et ils ont laiss\u00e9 la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et la Cour du Banc du Roi dans l\u2019ind\u00e9cision.\nLes circonstances sont plut\u00f4t d\u00e9favorables \u00e0 l\u2019appelante. Au cours de l\u2019examen de la preuve, nous avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019analyse des faits saillants. Il en est qui militent en faveur de la demanderesse: il en est d\u2019autres qui s\u2019opposent \u00e0 sa version avec \u00e9galement de force. Il pouvait \u00eatre \u201clogique, juste et raisonnable\u201d, comme le dit le juge de premi\u00e8re instance, que Marie-Louise Amiot f\u00eet cette disposition en faveur de sa fille adoptive. Cette raison n\u2019existait pas lors du testament, puisque l\u2019adoption n\u2019a eu lieu que deux ans plus tard.\nD\u2019autre part, il est certain que Mademoiselle Amiot \u00e9tait une personne tr\u00e8s particuli\u00e8re et tr\u00e8s m\u00e9ticuleuse. Il para\u00eet \u00e9trange qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019occasion d\u2019une simple visite inattendue de l\u2019appelante, qu elle n\u2019avait pas vue depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es, elle ait song\u00e9 \u00e0 br\u00fble-pourpoint \u00e0 faire un testament en sa faveur dans les circonstances difficiles o\u00f9 elle se trouvait ce jour-l\u00e0. Sa mentalit\u00e9 et son caract\u00e8re, tels qu\u2019ils sont r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9s par le dossier, portent \u00e0 croire qu\u2019elle aurait fait venir un notaire pour un acte qui, pour elle, avait une importance consid\u00e9rable. Ce que nous connaissons de Mademoiselle Amiot, \u00e0 travers ses \u00e9crits et les t\u00e9moignages rendus, donne \u00e0 toute l\u2019affaire une allure d\u2019improbabilit\u00e9.\nM\u00eame en accordant au t\u00e9moignage du mari et. \u00e0 celui de St-Arnaud tout le cr\u00e9dit possible, ils prouveraient seulement que le document existait le soir du 11 septembre 1923. Ils n\u2019ajoutent rien de plus. Ils n\u2019\u00e9tablissent pas l\u2019authenticit\u00e9 du document. Ils n\u2019\u00e9cartent pas la possibilit\u00e9 que ce document ait \u00e9t\u00e9 fabriqu\u00e9 avant de leur avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 montr\u00e9.\nPuis, tant d\u2019autres pr\u00e9somptions s\u2019accumulent contre l\u2019appelante: le codicille ne r\u00e9f\u00e8re en aucune fa\u00e7on au testament; il dispose d\u2019une somme de $7,000, qui est apparemment sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 la valeur totale des biens que Marie-Louise Amiot a laiss\u00e9s; il semblerait que la testatrice n\u2019e\u00fbt pas r\u00e9dig\u00e9 le document tel qu\u2019il est, comme, par exemple, l\u2019emploi du mot \u201cdollars\u201d, alors qu\u2019il est av\u00e9r\u00e9 qu\u2019elle se servait toujours du mot \u201cpiastres\u201d. La mention de la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019Ev\u00e9lina d\u00e9noterait que Marie-Louise s\u2019en servait comme t\u00e9moin. Pourquoi alors ne l\u2019avoir pas fait signer? Pourquoi m\u00eame n\u2019avoir pas demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mlle Lyman, qui \u00e9tait l\u00e0, de signer comme t\u00e9moin,? Tous ces petits d\u00e9tails, qui ne sont pas insignifiants\u2014car, dans une cause de cette nature, ce sont surtout les petits d\u00e9tails qui comptent,\u2014 prennent une importance consid\u00e9rable quand on songe \u00e0 la personne que l\u2019enqu\u00eate et les \u00e9crits \u00e9manant d\u2019elle nous ont d\u00e9peinte.\nIl y a ensuite que le document n\u2019est pas rest\u00e9 dans les papiers de la testatrice. C\u2019est l\u2019appelante qui l\u2019avait en sa possession. Elle a attendu pr\u00e8s de quatre ans avant de voir \u00e0 sa v\u00e9rification, ou, si l\u2019on veut, avant d\u2019en parler \u00e0 son notaire et de le lui remettre pour qu\u2019il f\u00eet les proc\u00e9dures requises par la loi. A part cela, il arrive qu\u2019elle ne prend sa d\u00e9cision que lorsque Ev\u00e9lina Amiot et Mlle Lyman sont mortes. L\u2019on se trouve en pr\u00e9sence de cette co\u00efncidence que les deux t\u00e9moins qui pourraient la contredire ne sont plus l\u00e0. Enfin, Ev\u00e9lina Amiot, qui, d\u2019apr\u00e8s la version de l\u2019appelante, ne saurait ignorer l\u2019existence du codicille, fait par devant notaire une d\u00e9claration au percepteur des droits de succession et y d\u00e9clare que le testament authentique de sa s\u0153ur en date du 11 f\u00e9vrier 1896 est son \u201cdernier testament\u201d et qu\u2019elle l\u2019a \u201cnon modifi\u00e9 ni r\u00e9voqu\u00e9\u201d. Il est difficile de penser que si Ev\u00e9lina Amiot, comme on l\u2019a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9, avait connu l\u2019existence du codicille elle ne l\u2019e\u00fbt pas mentionn\u00e9 dans cette d\u00e9claration solennelle.\nOn l\u2019admettra, l\u2019ensemble et le poids des circonstances se r\u00e9unissent pour jeter le soup\u00e7on sur la version de l\u2019appelante. On pr\u00e9tend que son t\u00e9moignage est rest\u00e9 \u201cintact\u201d et que les conjectures m\u00eame les plus graves ne devraient pas le faire mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9. Cependant on ne saurait dire ici que la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de la demanderesse n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en jeu puisque la cause \u00e9tait une attaque contre cette cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9. Malheureusement pour elle, la d\u00e9position asserment\u00e9e qu\u2019elle a donn\u00e9e et qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 produite pour les fins de la v\u00e9rification du codicille contient une affirmation tr\u00e8s importante qu\u2019elle a reconnue fausse dans son t\u00e9moignage. Il se peut que l\u2019explication qu\u2019elle en a donn\u00e9e soit une l\u00e9g\u00e8re att\u00e9nuation. On peut \u00eatre indulgent pour l\u2019appelante en pensant qu\u2019elle s\u2019en est rapport\u00e9e au notaire. Il reste cependant qu\u2019elle aurait sign\u00e9 sans savoir et qu\u2019elle aurait jur\u00e9 sans comprendre.\nIl r\u00e9sulte de tout cela, des circonstances et de la preuve, un doute extr\u00eamement s\u00e9rieux qui a laiss\u00e9 dans l\u2019incertitude la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du Banc du Roi, et l\u2019on peut dire \u00e9galement la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure. Cette derni\u00e8re a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 en faveur de l\u2019appelante parce qu\u2019elle fut d\u2019avis qu\u2019il incombait\nau mis-en-cause * * * d\u2019\u00e9tablir * * * de prouver hors de tout doute que le codicille qui fait la base de la pr\u00e9sente action \u00e9tait un codicille faux;\net, pour cette raison, elle a tranch\u00e9 le doute en faveur de l\u2019appelante. La Cour du Banc du Roi a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019avis, au contraire, qu\u2019il incombait \u201c\u00e0 la demanderesse de prouver la signature du codicille\u201d et elle a donc infirm\u00e9 le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance en d\u00e9boutant l\u2019appelante des fins de son action.\nUne \u00e9tude attentive du dossier n\u2019a pas amen\u00e9 chez nous une conviction suffisante pour nous permettre de juger diff\u00e9remment des faits et des circonstances. Il nous faut donc d\u00e9cider la question de droit qui se pose et qui est de savoir \u00e0 qui incombe le fardeau de la preuve. De cette d\u00e9cision d\u00e9pend la solution de la cause.\nLa loi est contenue dans le premier paragraphe de l\u2019article 857 et dans l\u2019article 858 du Code civil:\n857. Le testament olographe et celui fait suivant la forme d\u00e9riv\u00e9e del\u00e0 loi d\u2019Angleterre sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s pour v\u00e9rification au tribunal ayant juridiction sup\u00e9rieure de premi\u00e8re instance dans le district o\u00f9 le d\u00e9funt avait son domicile, dans celui o\u00f9 il est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9, ou \u00e0 l\u2019un des juges de ce tribunal, ou au protonotaire du district. Le tribunal, le juge ou le protonotaire re\u00e7oit les d\u00e9clarations par \u00e9crit et sous serment de t\u00e9moins comp\u00e9tents \u00e0 rendre t\u00e9moignage, lesquelles demeurent annex\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019original du testament, ainsi que le jugement, s\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu hors de cour, ou une copie certifi\u00e9e, s\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu par le tribunal. Il peut ensuite \u00eatre d\u00e9livr\u00e9 aux int\u00e9ress\u00e9s des copies certifi\u00e9es du testament, de la preuve et du jugement, lesquelles sont authentiques, et font donner effet au testament, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019il soit infirm\u00e9 sur contestation.\n* * *\n858. Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que l\u2019h\u00e9ritier du d\u00e9funt soit appel\u00e9 \u00e0 la v\u00e9rification ainsi faite d\u2019un testament, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019il n\u2019en soit ainsi ordonn\u00e9 d\u2019ans des cas particuliers.\nL\u2019autorit\u00e9 qui proc\u00e8de & cette v\u00e9rification prend connaissance de tout ce qui concerne le testament.\nLa v\u00e9rification ainsi faite d\u2019un testament n\u2019en emp\u00eache pas la contestation par ceux qui y ont int\u00e9r\u00eat. L\u2019on voit par l\u00e0 que la v\u00e9rification peut se faire ex parte. \u201cIl n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que l\u2019h\u00e9ritier du d\u00e9funt soit appel\u00e9\u201d On peut affirmer que, dans la pratique, il est exceptionnellement rare qu\u2019il le soit.\nEn plus, \u201cla v\u00e9rification n\u2019emp\u00eache pas la contestation par ceux qui y ont int\u00e9r\u00eat\u201d. Et le Conseil priv\u00e9 a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que cette partie de l\u2019article conservait son effet m\u00eame \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ceux qui s\u2019\u00e9taient oppos\u00e9s \u00e0 la v\u00e9rification. (Migneault v. Malo[2]; voir aussi Wynne v. Wynne[3].) Le jugement de v\u00e9rification n\u2019a donc pas l\u2019effet de la chose jug\u00e9e. Et l\u2019on peut dire que la juridiction exerc\u00e9e en ces mati\u00e8res est plut\u00f4t \u201cgracieuse ou non contentieuse\u201d que judiciaire. (Migneault, Droit civil canadien, vol. 4, p. 314.)\nSir Robert Phillimore, rendant le jugement du Conseil priv\u00e9 dans la cause de Migneault v. Malo2, signale la diff\u00e9rence essentielle entre le \u201cprobate\u201d de la loi anglaise et la \u201cv\u00e9rification\u201d suivant le syst\u00e8me de la province de Qu\u00e9bec. Il fait remarquer que ce qui est \u201csomewhat loosely termed proving\u201d est, en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, un simple \u201cregistering\u201d. M. le juge Badgley, dans la m\u00eame cause, avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit[4]:\nThe v\u00e9rification of the common law and the probate of the statute (le code), similar in their legal result, have effect only upon the factum of the will to be proved, and the incidents of its deposit and enregistration.\nEnvisag\u00e9 de ce point de vue, le principal but de la v\u00e9rification serait de donner la publicit\u00e9 au testament olographe et \u00e0 celui fait suivant la forme d\u00e9riv\u00e9e de la loi d\u2019Angleterre. Un autre but, dont parle le code, serait qu\u2019il\npeut ensuite \u00eatre d\u00e9livr\u00e9 aux int\u00e9ress\u00e9s des copies certifi\u00e9es du testament, lesquelles sont authentiques.\nMais en soi, d\u2019apr\u00e8s le texte du code, le testament v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 ne change pas de caract\u00e8re. La v\u00e9rification n\u2019en fait pas un acte authentique; les copies seules le sont. Le code poursuit:\net font donner effet au testament jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019il soit infirm\u00e9 sur contestation.\nTextuellement, cela voudrait dire que les copies authentiques du testament, de la preuve et du jugement \u201cfont donner effet au testament\u201d. Il faut plut\u00f4t comprendre que l\u2019effet du testament v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 subsiste \u201cjusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019il soit infirm\u00e9\u201d. Mais en dehours de la publicit\u00e9, qui est \u00e9vidente et du pouvoir d\u2019en donner des copies qui y est exprim\u00e9, le code n\u2019indique aucun effet qui r\u00e9sulterait de la v\u00e9rification.\nL\u2019une des cons\u00e9quences est-elle que le fardeau de la preuve s\u2019en trouve d\u00e9plac\u00e9? Suffit-il ensuite au b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire d\u2019un testament v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 d\u2019invoquer cette v\u00e9rification pour contraindre \u201cceux qui y ont int\u00e9r\u00eat\u201d \u00e0 faire une preuve n\u00e9gative? Du moment que le testament v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 est contest\u00e9, est-ce au b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire qu\u2019il incombe de prouver l\u2019\u00e9criture et la signature du testament v\u00e9rifi\u00e9, comme l\u2019a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du Banc du Roi en la pr\u00e9sente cause, ou, est-ce celui qui r\u00e9pudie le testament qui doit prouver que cette \u00e9criture et cette signature sont fausses, suivant le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure?\nIl semblerait extraordinaire que la v\u00e9rification, \u00e0 laquelle il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019appeler les int\u00e9ress\u00e9s, p\u00fbt modifier la position et les droits de ces derniers. Avant la v\u00e9rification, celui qui voudrait opposer un testament olographe \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00e9ritier du d\u00e9funt aurait le fardeau de la preuve. Par le seul fait d\u2019une v\u00e9rification \u00e0 laquelle l\u2019h\u00e9ritier n\u2019aurait pris aucune part, qui aurait m\u00eame pu avoir lieu hors de sa connaissance, c\u2019est sur lui maintenant que ce fardeau reposerait, et il serait ainsi priv\u00e9 de ses avantages ant\u00e9rieurs. De prime abord, cela para\u00eet injuste. On incline \u00e0 croire que le sens des articles 857 et 858 C.C. est plut\u00f4t \u00e0 l\u2019effet que, advenant la contestation, les parties seront plac\u00e9es dans la m\u00eame position que s\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas eu v\u00e9rification. Il y a d\u00e9j\u00e0 en ce sens dans la jurisprudence de la province de Qu\u00e9bec l\u2019opinion clairement exprim\u00e9e par sir Melbourne Tait, dans St. George Society v. Nichols[5]. Nous n\u2019interpr\u00e9tons pas l\u2019arr\u00eat re Doucet v. MacNider[6], o\u00f9 d\u2019ailleurs il s\u2019agissait de capacit\u00e9 mentale, comme exposant une opinion diff\u00e9rente.\nQuant au Rapport des Commissaires (5e Rapport, 178), il parle de cette section comme traitant\nde la v\u00e9rification pr\u00e9liminaire qui se fait devant le juge (des testaments) qui ne sont pas faits en la forme authentique.\nIl ajoute qu\u2019il y a\nint\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 ce que (leur) validit\u00e9 subisse de suite une premi\u00e8re \u00e9preuve. On pourrait r\u00e9sumer le point de vue que nous venons d\u2019exposer par une formule de la doctrine fran\u00e7aise, avec laquelle il ne faut cependant pas faire d\u2019analogie, vu que le syst\u00e8me est diff\u00e9rent, mais qui est commode pour en exprimer la pens\u00e9e: En principe, en ce qui regarde la force probante, le testament, m\u00eame apr\u00e8s sa v\u00e9rification, n\u2019est toujours qu\u2019un acte sous seing priv\u00e9. (2 Baudry-Lacantinerie, 3e \u00e9d., Des donations, vol. II, n\u00b0 1981 et suiv.; 13 Laurent, n\u00b0 239 et suiv.; 10 Aubry et Rau, 5e \u00e9d., parag. 669; 21 Demolombe, n\u00b0 143 et suiv.).\nPour d\u00e9cider la cause qui nous est soumise, cependant, on peut \u00e9viter d\u2019aller aussi loin. On pourrait m\u00eame admettre, pour les besoins de l\u2019argument, que le jugement de v\u00e9rification constitue une preuve provisoire. En l\u2019absence de l\u2019article 858 C.C., nous n\u2019avons pas de doute que la requ\u00eate civile serait un moyen efficace dans les cas pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 l\u2019article 1177 du Code de proc\u00e9dure pour faire mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 un jugement de v\u00e9rification; par suite de l\u2019article 858 C.C., les intim\u00e9s, dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, pouvaient se contenter de demander l\u2019annulation de la v\u00e9rification par leur d\u00e9fense. C\u2019est ce qui fut d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans Migneault v. Malo[7]. C\u2019est ce qu\u2019ont fait les intim\u00e9s. Or, le faux affidavit qui a servi de base \u00e0 la v\u00e9rification du codicille de Marie-Louise Amiot est une cause bien suffisante pour mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 cette v\u00e9rification. La d\u00e9claration erron\u00e9e et inexacte qui s\u2019y trouvait portait sur un point que l\u2019officier qui a prononc\u00e9 la v\u00e9rification a pu tenir pour d\u00e9cisif, puisqu\u2019il laissait entendre que le codicille \u00e9tait attest\u00e9 par un t\u00e9moin dont la signature \u00e9tait reconnue. Nous avons donc un \u00e9l\u00e9ment qui, en mati\u00e8re ordinaire, ferait accueillir une requ\u00eate civile: un jugement prononc\u00e9 sur une preuve dont la fausset\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 depuis d\u00e9couverte (art. 1177 C.P.C.). Il importe peu, il nous semble, que la v\u00e9rification soit mise de c\u00f4t\u00e9 avant ou pendant le proc\u00e8s qui s\u2019est engag\u00e9 sur le codicille. La Cour du Banc du Roi a annul\u00e9 la v\u00e9rification du testament et nous sommes d\u2019avis qu\u2019elle a eu raison. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la v\u00e9rification \u00e9tant \u00e9cart\u00e9e, il est clair qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du codicille, les parties se trouvaient au m\u00eame \u00e9tat qu\u2019elles \u00e9taient auparavant. L\u2019appelante avait donc \u00e0 prouver le codicille qu\u2019elle invoquait et elle n\u2019y a pas r\u00e9ussi. Il s\u2019ensuit que nous sommes d\u2019accord avec la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du Banc du Roi et que nous confirmons son jugement, avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Poulin & Demers.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Duranleau, Angers & Monty.\n[1] (1928) Q.O.R. 45 K.B. 85.\n[2] L.R. 4 P.C. 123.\n[3] [1921] 62 Can.

It was alleged on behalf of the applicant that the warrant under which he was restrained of his liberty and confined in gaol did not disclose on its face a right or justification so to restrain or confine. The warrant was made by a Commissioner appointed under the Combines Investigation Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 26, and ordered the applicant\u2019s detention in gaol until he should have purged his contempt of an order made by the Commissioner under s. 22 of the said Act, for that the applicant did at Toronto, Ontario, on July, 22, 1929, \u201cunlawfully refuse after being lawfully ordered to do so, to be examined under oath before me, a Commissioner under the said Act, by Order in Council P.C. No. 1311, of the Dominion of Canada; and for that he did at Toronto aforesaid on the said date unlawfully refuse to produce the documents, books, and papers of [certain associations named] ordered by me to be produced by him under the authority vested in me by the said Act as the Commissioner so appointed.\u201d W. F. O\u2019Connor K.C. and F. D. Hogg K.C. for the applicant.\nNo one contra.\nNewcombe J.\u2014My jurisdiction to issue a writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum is limited by section 57 of the Supreme Court Act, and it may be exercised only \u201cfor the purpose of an inquiry into the cause of commitment in any criminal case under any Act of the Parliament of Canada.\u201d\nMy difficulty about this application is to bring it within the words of the statute. This is not the sort of commitment intended, and, moreover, the inquiry in which the commissioner was engaged was not \u201cin any criminal case\u201d within the meaning of the law. The statute evidently points to a criminal prosecution sanctioned by the Parliament of Canada and charging a case visited by commitment. When Parliament, for the purpose of defining jurisdiction, speaks in the general terms used of \u201ccommitment in a criminal case under an Act of the Parliament,\u201d I think it may safely be held to the distinct and unequivocal meaning, and therefore restricted to commitment for an offence which Parliament has constituted or declared; I would exclude a mere incidental or collateral exercise of the power which a commissioner for inquiry possesses to enforce attendance or obedience on the part of a witness, which, although conferred by reference upon a commissioner under sections 18 and 22 of the Combines Investigation Act, affects only his jurisdiction to make an order. There are provisions in this Act, under the caption \u201cOffences and Penalties,\u201d sections 33, 34, 36 and 38, by which it is enacted that a person shall be guilty of an offence, and liable, on summary conviction or indictment, to fine or imprisonment, who wilfully interferes with the proceedings of a commissioner, or fails to attend, or to give evidence, or to produce books and papers, or who otherwise obstructs, impedes or prevents the investigation. These provisions, or some of them, doubtless sanction commitment in the sense in which the Supreme Court Act uses the term; but the jurisdiction to impose the appropriate penalty and to adjudge the commitment is conferred, not upon the commissioner, but upon the competent tribunals under the enactments of the Criminal Code with respect to summary convictions or indictable offences; and the commitment in question is not, and does not profess to be, founded upon any of these provisions. It seeks to apply a common law remedy.\nI refuse the application.\nApplication refused.\n",

(the Special Act), s. 18; Co-operative Associations Act, R.S.A., 1922, c. 160, s. 20; Arbitration Act, R.S.A., 1922, c. 98, s. 5. Plaintiff entered into a \"marketing agreement\" with the defendant \"Pool\" (Alberta Co-operative Wheat Producers, Ltd.). It recited that plaintiff desired to co-operate with other growers in producing and marketing wheat, that the Pool had been formed with power to act as the agent of its members as to marketing, that plaintiff desired to become a member and to enter, with other growers, into the agreement, that the agreement, although individual in expression, was one of a series between the Pool and the growers of wheat in Alberta and should constitute one contract between the several growers signing it and the Pool. In the agreement plaintiff applied for a share of the capital stock of the Pool, which covenanted to allot same to him. Plaintiff agreed to deliver his wheat for certain years and the Pool agreed to market it. Provision was made for retention by the Pool, out of the returns for sale of the wheat, of its expenses, of 1% as a commercial reserve to be used for any of its purposes, and of an amount for investment in shares of an elevator company. After expiration of the agreement plaintiff brought action, claiming that he had not been given a proper accounting, nor payment of his proper proportion of the proceeds of the wheat sold, that certain excess earnings had been inequitably distributed among the Pool members, and that shares in an elevator company purchased with his money had not been put in his name; and he claimed an accounting, payment of his proper share, transfer into his name of said elevator company shares, and damages. The Pool moved to stay proceedings on the ground that the matters in controversy must he decided by arbitration. The Pool was in- corporated under the Alberta Co-operative Associations Act, which provided for appointment of trustees, whose duties should be to conduct and manage all the business of the association, and (s. 20) that \"every dispute between any member or members of an association * * * and the trustees, treasurer or other officer thereof, shall be decided by arbitration in manner directed by the rules or by-laws of the association.\" By Special Act (1924, c. 7) the Pool's incorporation and existing by-laws were confirmed, and it was provided that the provisions of the Co-operative Associations Act should (except as superseded) continue to apply to it. Under its by-laws the trustees had power to conduct and manage all its business, and to enter into and carry into effect the marketing agreement. By-law 57 provided that \"every dispute between any member * * * and the trustees, treasurer or other officer\" of the Pool should be decided by arbitration (with a proviso that this provision should not apply as between the Pool and any member who failed to fulfil any covenant in the marketing agreement).\nHeld: (1) Existence of a \"dispute\" was shewn by the allegations and demands in the statement of claim. Although it would have been better practice to allege, in the affidavits supporting the Pool's motion, that a dispute had existed prior to the commencement of the action, failure to do so was not fatal, provided the allegations in the statement of claim were consistent only with the existence of such a dispute. The issue of a writ to enforce a right claimed is, of itself, some evidence of the existence of a dispute.\n(2) As to plaintiff's contention that any dispute was with the Pool, and not with its \"trustees, treasurer or other officer\" within the meaning of said arbitration provisions:\u2014As it was the trustees' duty to carry into effect the provisions of the marketing agreement, a dispute as to the proper manner of carrying out those provisions was properly termed a dispute with the trustees. But, in any case, in view of the purposes of the Pool and the whole scheme and purpose shewn in the Pool legislation (Municipal Bldg. Soc. v. Kent, 9 App. Cas., 260, at pp. 284-5) it must be taken that the legislative intention was that the arbitration provisions should apply to all disputes arising under the marketing agreement, unless expressly excepted in the by-laws. (This conclusion received support from the proviso of by-law 57. It was unnecessary had it not been intended that the arbitration provisions should apply to the marketing agreement. By c. 7 of 1924, the bylaws, including by-law 57 with its proviso, had received legislative sanction, the legislature thus impliedly declaring that the arbitration provision should apply to disputes under the agreement except those covered by the proviso).\nJudgment of the Appellate Division, Alta., [1929] 1 W.W.R. 413, affirmed, except that it was varied so as to stay proceedings instead of dismissing the action.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], which reversed the judgment of Walsh J.[2], and dismissed the plaintiff's action. The defendant, Alberta Co-operative Wheat Producers, Limited, moved before Walsh J. for an order that all further proceedings in the action be stayed, pursuant to s. 5 of the Arbitration Act, R.S.A., 1922, c. 98, on the ground that the matters in controversy must be decided by arbitration. The other defendant moved for an order dismissing it from the action on the grounds of non-disclosure of cause of action and misjoinder, and, in the alternative, asked for an order staying proceedings. The motions were dismissed[3]. On appeal by the defendants, the Appellate Division held [4] that the matters in dispute in the action were properly the subject of arbitration and not the proper subject of litigation, and that the action should be dismissed. Special leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was granted to the plaintiff by the Appellate Division.\nThe nature of the action, the material facts of the case, and the statutory provisions involved, are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was dismissed with costs, but the order of the Appellate Division was varied so as to stay proceedings instead of dismissing the action.\nA. A. McGillivray K.C. for the appellant.\nA. Macleod Sinclair K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nLAMONT J.\u2014In this appeal we have to determine whether the appellant (plaintiff) is entitled to maintain the action or whether the matter in controversy between the parties must be decided by arbitration.\nThe appellant is a grower of wheat in the province of Alberta and also a member of the Alberta Co-operative Wheat Producers, Limited (hereinafter called the \"Pool\") The Alberta Pool Elevators, Limited, is a company organized and controlled by the Pool for the purpose of furnishing the Pool members with the elevator facilities necessary for the handling of their wheat.\nThe Pool was incorporated in August, 1923, under the Co-operative Associations Act, and, on or about April 1, 1924, the appellant and the Pool entered into an agreement, which I shall hereinafter refer to as the \"Marketing Agree- ment.\" That agreement recited that the appellant was desirous of co-operating with other growers in the producing and marketing of wheat; that the Pool had been formed with power to act as the agent of its members so far as marketing of grain was concerned; that the appellant was desirous of becoming a member of the Pool and of entering, with other growers, into the marketing agreement, and that the Marketing Agreement, although individual in expression, was one of a series between the Pool and the growers of wheat in Alberta and should constitute one contract between the several growers signing the same, and the Pool. In the agreement the appellant applied for a share of the capital stock of the Pool, and the Pool, on its part, covenanted to allot the same to him. The appellant also agreed to deliver to the Pool all the wheat produced or acquired by him, except his seed wheat, during the years 1924 to 1927 inclusive, and the Pool agreed to receive and market the same. The agreement provided that out of the gross return from the sale of the wheat delivered to it the Pool might retain and deduct sufficient sums to pay the marketing and other charges and expenses of the Pool and, in addition, might deduct one per cent. of the gross selling price as a commercial reserve to be used for any of the purposes of the Pool. It also provided for the deduction of an amount, not exceeding two cents per bushel, to be invested, in the discretion of the trustees, in shares of the capital stock of any elevator company formed for the acquisition of grain elevators wherewith to handle the wheat of the Pool members.\nAfter the expiration of the Marketing Agreement the appellant brought this action. In his statement of claim he set out the material provisions of the agreement and alleged that during the years 1924 to 1927 inclusive, he delivered to the Pool the wheat produced by him; that this wheat the Pool sold; that it deducted 1% of the gross selling price of his wheat to form a commercial reserve, and two cents a bushel which it invested in shares of the capital stock of the respondent, the Alberta Pool Elevators, Limited; that of these sums no proper accounting had been given to him, nor had the shares in the Alberta Pool Elevators, Limited, purchased with his money, been put in his name. He also alleged that although the Pool had from time to time purported to account and make payments of the moneys payable to him, he had never had a proper accounting, nor had he received payment of his proper proportion of the proceeds of the wheat sold. He further alleged that in 1928 the Pool distributed one million dollars of excess earnings among the Pool members, not, however, on any equitable basis but in such a way as to favour those members who delivered their wheat at elevators owned by the Alberta Pool Elevators, Limited, as against those members at whose point of delivery the Pool had no elevator, and that such distribution was without moral of legal justification, and in derogation of the appellant's rights, and he claimed an accounting of the proceeds of the wheat he had delivered to the Pool, and of the deductions which had been made therefrom and payment to him of his proper share. He also claimed to have transferred into his own name the shares in the Alberta Pool Elevators, Limited, purchased with moneys deducted from the proceeds of his wheat, and $2,500 damages.\nOn being served with a writ in the action the Pool moved, pursuant to s. 5 of the Arbitration Act, for an order that all proceedings be stayed on the ground that, under the Special Act, c. 7 of 1924 (which confirmed the incorporation of the Pool and its existing by-laws), all the matters in controversy between the appellant and the Pool had to be decided by arbitration. The learned judge in Chambers[5], dismissed the application but struck out paragraph 42 of the statement of claim, in which the appellant claimed the right to inspect the books of the Pool, which right he said had been refused to him. On appeal the Appellate Division reversed the order of the Chamber judge and dismissed the appellant's action[6]. Hence this appeal.\nThe statutory provisions material to the appeal are: Section 18 of chapter 7 of 1924; section 20 of the Co-operative Associations Act; and clause 57 of the By-laws. They read as follows:\u2014\n(18) All the provisions of the Co-operative Associations Act shall continue to apply to the corporation, except and so far only as the same are superseded by or are in conflict with any of the provisions of this Act or of any presently existing by-law of the corporation or of any by-law hereafter passed pursuant to the provisions of this Act.\n(20) Every dispute between any member or members of an association under this Act, or any person claiming through or under a member, or under the rules or by-laws of the association, and the trustees, treasurer, or other officer thereof, shall be decided by arbitration in manner directed by the rules or by-laws of the association, and the decision so made shall be binding and conclusive on all parties without appeal, and application for the enforcement thereof may be made to the District Court.\n(57) Every dispute between any Member or Members of this Association or under the By-laws and the Trustees, Treasurer or other officer thereof shall be decided by the arbitration as provided by the Arbitration Act, provided, however, that this provision shall not apply as between the Association and any Member who fails to fulfil any of the covenants contained in the Marketing Agreement.\nThe first question to be determined is, was there a dispute between the appellant as a member of the Pool and its trustees, treasurer or other officer? For the appellant it was contended, (1) that there was no evidence of the existence of any dispute, and (2) that if there was, the dispute was between the appellant and the Pool, and not with its trustees, treasurer or other officer.\nIn my opinion, the issue of a writ to enforce a right claimed is, of itself, some evidence of the existence of a dispute. In this case a perusal of the allegations set out and the demands made in the statement of claim establishes, beyond question, that the appellant was very decidedly disputing the correctness of the acts done and the proceedings taken on the part of those who were managing the affairs of the Pool, not only in reference to the payment to him of the proceeds of his grain and the investment of the two cents per bushel in shares of the capital stock of the Alberta Pool Elevators, Limited, in the name of the Pool, but also in reference to the distribution of the one million dollars excess earnings. It would, in my opinion, have been better practice if, in the affidavits filed in support of the motion, someone on behalf of the Pool had alleged that a dispute had existed prior to the commencement of the action. Failure to do so, however, is not fatal to the motion provided the allegations in the statement of claim are consistent only with the existence of such a dispute.\nThen with whom was the appellant disputing? He claims it was solely with the Pool and not with its trustees; that the matters in dispute arose out of the Marketing Agreement which he had entered into with the Pool before he became a member thereof.\nThe Pool, being a corporate body, could have a dispute with the appellant only through its proper officers who would act on its behalf. Subs. 1 of s. 3 of the Co-operative Associations Act provides that to secure incorporation under that Act the persons desiring to become incorporated shall file in the office of the Registrar a memorandum of association duly verified, together with a copy of the rules or by-laws agreed upon.\nSubs. 3 in part reads as follows:\u2014\nThe said rules or by-laws shall contain provisions in respect of the following matters: (f) The appointment of trustees * * * whose duties shall be to conduct and manage all the business of the association.\nThe by-laws filed provide:\nThe Powers of the Trustees are:\u2014\n(a) To conduct and manage all the business of the Association and to do all acts and perform all duties stipulated to be done or performed by the Trustees by the Co-operative Associations Act or these by-laws, and any amendments thereto * * *.\n(e) To enter into and carry into effect, with or without modification, the Contract attached to the Memorandum of Association * * * (Marketing Agreement).\nAs it was the duty of the trustees to carry into effect the provisions of the Marketing Agreement, I am unable to understand why a dispute as to the proper manner of carrying out these provisions is not properly termed a \"dispute with the trustees.\" In my opinion it is, but I think there are other and broader grounds upon which this appeal may be disposed of.\nIn the first place I would adopt as applicable here the principle laid down by Lord Watson in Municipal Building Society v. Kent[7], where His Lordship said:\u2014\nBut the question whether certain proceedings are to be regarded as disputes between the society and its members, arising within the society, appears to me in the case of each statute to depend upon the intention of the legislature, to be gathered from the whole provisions of the Act.\nThe object of the promoters of the Pool as disclosed in the memorandum of association and by-laws filed, and the intention of the legislature as disclosed in the Special Act which confirmed and validated the incorporation of the Pool, under the Co-operative Associations Act, was to ensure the existence of a corporate body whose most important function would be to receive the wheat of its members and market the same and return to them the proceeds thereof, subject to the deductions therefrom provided for in the Marketing Agreement and in the by-laws. The Marketing Agreement provides that each grower signing the same shall become a member of the corporate body, and the by-laws provide that all members shall sign the standard Marketing Agreement current at the time of their entrance as members. It was by virtue of his membership in the Pool that the appellant was entitled to have the Pool market his wheat under the terms of the Marketing Agreement. It is true he signed the Marketing Agreement before a share of the capital stock of the Pool had been allotted to him, but in the agreement he applied for a share and obtained a covenant from the Pool that his application would be granted. The whole scheme of the Pool legislation was the co-operative marketing of the wheat of the Pool members through the medium of a corporate body composed of themselves, and upon terms agreed upon and embodied in the Marketing Agreement, which agreement, as its recital shews, was not to be considered as simply an individual contract with each grower, but was to constitute one contract of which one contracting party was the Pool and the other the members of the corporate body. Such being the purpose of the legislation, can it reasonably be contended that the appellant's rights under the Marketing Agreement are entirely disassociated from his membership in the Pool, or that the legislature did not contemplate the application to that agreement of the arbitration provisions found in the Act and in the by-laws? In view of the fact that the marketing of the wheat was the chief purpose of the Pool; that it was incorporated under the Co-operative Associations Act which provided that the trustees should conduct and manage all its business, and that all disputes between a member and the trustees should be decided by arbitration, and in view of the fact that the by-laws expressly provide that the trustees shall carry into effect the Marketing Agreement, and that the Special Act has not only confirmed the incorporation of the Pool but has declared that all the provisions of the Co-operative Associations Act shall continue to apply, except in so far as they are superseded, I am clearly of opinion that the legislative intention was that the arbitration provisions should apply to all disputes arising under the Marketing Agreement, unless expressly excepted in the by-laws.\nThis conclusion, in my opinion, receives support from the proviso of by-law 57, which expressly states that the arbitration provisions shall not apply as between the Pool and any member who fails to fulfil any of the covenants contained in the Marketing Agreement. If it had not been intended that the arbitration provisions should apply to the Marketing Agreement there was absolutely no object in inserting the proviso in the by-law. As the by-laws were, in the Special Act, declared to be valid and binding, clause 57, with its proviso, has received legislative sanction. Impliedly, therefore, the legislature, by sanctioning the proviso, has declared that the arbitration provision shall apply to disputes under the Marketing Agreement, except those covered by the proviso.\nThe only other point to which I need refer is: Should the appellant's action have been dismissed or only stayed? It was dismissed by the Appellate Division although the motion asked only that it be stayed. Under s. 20 of the Co-operative Associations Act, when the arbitration has taken place and the decision given, that decision shall be binding and conclusive on all parties without appeal. There is, however, nothing binding or conclusive until the arbitration has taken place. In his affidavit Mr. Sinclair states that he was informed by R. D. Purdy (Pool manager) that the Pool was, at the time this action was commenced, and still is, ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration. No doubt this was, and still is, so. As, however, the plaintiff's right of action would exist should the arbitration fail to decide the matters in dispute, the proper course, in my opinion, was to grant a stay of proceedings rather than to dismiss the action.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs but would vary the order so as to stay proceedings instead of dismissing the action.\nAppeal dismissed with costs; order below varied.\n[1] [1929] 1 W.W.R. 413.\n[2] [1929] 1 W.W.R. 96.\n[3] [1929] 1 W.W.R. 96.\n[4] [1929] 1 W.W.R. 413.\n[5] [1929] 1 W.W.R. 96.\n[6] [1929] 1 W.W.R. 413.\n[7] (1884) 9 App. Cas. 260, at pp. 284-5.\n",

Moyer & Company (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nSmith & Goldberg Limited (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1929: May 30, 31; 1929: June 13.\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Newcombe, Lamont and Smith JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ONTARIO.\nContract\u2014Sale of goods\u2014Statute of Frauds (now s. 5 of Sale of Goods Act, R.S.O., 1927, c. 163)\u2014Revocation of agent\u2019s authority before signing by agent of memorandum.\nAppellants claimed (by counterclaim) damages for breach of contract of sale of goods from respondent to them. They alleged an oral contract made by G. for respondent. To meet the requirements of s. 17 of the Statute of Frauds (now R.S.O., 1927, c. 163, s. 5), they relied upon a subsequent \u201cconfirmation\u201d signed by G. for respondent. They also set up a subsequent written agreement of settlement made by G. for respondent, fixing the damages.\nHeld, that at the time G. signed the confirmation he was not respondent\u2019s \u201cagent in that behalf\u201d within the requirement of the Statute of Frauds. Assuming the oral contract, and that on its date G. had authority to sell and that this included authority to sign a memorandum evidencing such sale (Rosenbaum v. Belson, [1900] 2 Ch. 267), his authority could be effectively revoked at any time before he signed the memorandum (Farmer v. Robinson, 2 Camp., 339n; Bowstead, Agency, 7th Ed., p. 470; Warwick v. Slade, 3 Camp. 127; Xenos v. Wickham, L.R. 2 H.L. 296, at p. 314, referred to); and the evidence established such revocation and notification thereof to appellants before G. signed the confirmation.\nHeld, also, that, upon the evidence, G. had no authority, actual or ostensible, to make with appellants the agreement for settlement.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division, Ont., 63 Ont. L.R. 388, dismissing appellants\u2019 counterclaim, affirmed.\nAPPEAL by the defendants from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], which, reversing the judgment of Logie J., dismissed their counterclaim, which was the only matter in dispute.\nThe appellants carry on business at Fort Wayne, Indiana. The respondent company carries on business at Toronto, Ontario. The appellants claimed damages from respondent for failure to carry out an alleged contract of sale of hides from respondent to them, made in December, 1927. This alleged contract was made orally between one Goldberg (who was the secretary-treasurer of the respondent company) on behalf of the respondent company, and a member of the appellant firm. The appellants then gave instructions to their brokers in Toronto, MacNeillie & Co., who communicated with the respondent. Some controversy arose, and Smith, the president of the respondent company, refused to sign the \u201cconfirmation\u201d note sent to respondent by the brokers. Thereafter, however, the \u201cconfirmation\u201d was signed by Goldberg, purporting to act for the respondent company. Subsequently Goldberg, purporting to act for the respondent company, made a written agreement of settlement whereby the appellants\u2019 damages for breach of contract were fixed at $2,500. The appellants claimed for this sum, and, alternatively, for $3,000 damages for breach of contract. The respondent denied that any contract was ever arrived at, set up the Statute of Frauds (now the Sale of Goods Act, R.S.O., 1927, c. 163, s. 5), and denied Goldberg\u2019s authority to bind it by signing on its behalf the \u201cconfirmation\u201d or the agreement of settlement. The further material facts (as found by this Court) appear in the judgment now reported.\nAt the trial Logie J. gave judgment for the defendants (the present appellants) on their said counterclaim. This judgment was reversed by the Appellate Division[2]. The appeal to this Court was dismissed with costs.\nI.F. Hellmuth K.C. and I. Levinter for the appellants.\nR.H. Greer K.C. and A.H. Brown for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nANGLIN C.J.C.\u2014In this action, begun on the 26th of January, 1928, the plaintiff (respondent) claimed $900 as a balance due it on account for goods sold and delivered to the defendants (appellants). Subject to their counterclaim for $2,500 as damages for breach of contract, which forms the sole subject of the present appeal, the defendants admitted owing the $900 claimed; and the plaintiff at present holds a judgment for that amount, the judgment at the trial in the defendants\u2019 favour on the counterclaim having been unanimously reversed by the Second Appellate Divisional Court2, from whose judgment the present appeal is taken. The counterclaim is based on a breach of an oral contract for the sale of a specific lot of hides to the appellants, alleged to have been made by one Goldberg, as salesman of the respondent company, on the 30th of December, 1927. The Appellate Divisional Court has upheld the respondent\u2019s plea of the Statute of Frauds in answer to this counterclaim in so far as it reste upon the oral contract of the 30th of December, 1927, and its plea of lack of authority in so far as the counterclaim rests on an alleged settlement in writing of the appellants\u2019 claim for damages, which Goldberg purported to make on behalf of the respondent on the 14th of February, 1928.\nOn the short ground that at the time he signed a so-called confirmation note, relied upon by the appellants to meet the requirements of s. 5 of R.S.O., 1927, c. 163 (Statute of Frauds, s. 17), Goldberg was not the \u201cagent in that behalf\u201d of the respondent company, we would affirm the judgment in appeal, in so far as the appellants\u2019 claim depends on the enforcement of the original oral contract. Thirkell v. Cambi[3]. We assume, in the appellants\u2019 favour, that Goldberg actually made a verbal contract for the sale to them of the goods in question, and that he had, on the 30th of December, 1927, the date at which the oral contract is said to have been made, authority to sell and that this included authority to sign a memorandum evidencing such sale (Rosenbaum v. Belson[4]). Subject to two definite exceptions, within neither of which the case at bar falls, the authority conferred by an agency contract is, from its very nature, revocable at any time at the will of the principal. It may be effectively revoked, when writing is necessary, \u201ceven after a verbal contract has been made by the agent,\u201d at any time before he has signed the statutory memorandum. Lord Ellenborough, applying this doctrine, so held, as early as 1805, in Farmer v. Robinson[5], which is cited in Bowstead, Agency, (1924), 7th Ed., p. 470, as authority for this proposition. See also Warwick v. Slade[6], cited with approval in Xenos v. Wickham[7].\nThe only question in such a case is one of notice of the revocation to the third party dealing with the agent. The admitted facts in evidence put it beyond doubt that the appellants had such notice from the 10th of January, 1928. They had actual knowledge that the president of the respondent company, Smith, repudiated the contract on behalf of the company and that the hides in question had in fact been sold to another purchaser.\nThe evidence of the broker, McNeillie, who was accredited by the learned trial judge, clearly establishes that he was exclusively the agent of the appellants in the transaction; that he knew on the 10th of January, 1928, that the president of the respondent company had refused to sign the confirmation note, sent him by Mr. McNeillie in the usual course for signature to bind that company, and was in fact repudiating any obligation on its part to carry out the contract sued upon; that the hides, the subject matter thereof, had already then been sold to another purchaser; and he, McNeillie, then communicated these facts to his principals. There is no suggestion of any subsequent authority having been given to Goldberg \u201cto confirm\u201d the contract in question.\nMcNeillie, nevertheless, procured Goldberg to sign a so-called confirmation note (dated back to the 30th of December, 1927) at some later time\u2014within three weeks after the 10th of January, 1928, is his best recollection of the time, though he will not swear that it was not signed in February\u2014with the obvious purpose of furnishing to the appellants an answer to the defence of the Statute of Frauds, should the respondent invoke it, and with the clear intent of rendering the respondent company liable to them for damages for breach of contract. These circumstances rebut any suggestion that Goldberg had ostensible authority to sign the confirmation note and that McNeillie took it in good faith from Goldberg, relying upon the latter having authority thereby to bind the respondent as his principal.\nAs to the alleged settlement of the appellants\u2019 claim, against the respondent for damages for breach of contract at $2,500, signed on February 14, 1928, by Goldberg at Fort Wayne, the difficulties in the way of the appellants\u2019 attempt to maintain Goldberg\u2019s authority to bind the respondent are even more formidable. Upon the evidence of Gurofsky, a witness for the appellants, to contend for any actual authorization of Goldberg by the respondent company to make such settlement is impossible; and the antecedent circumstances preclude the view that the appellants dealt with him on any footing of ostensible authority, were it possible to support an agreement so far out of the course of a salesman\u2019s or secretary\u2019s ordinary powers and duties on the footing of mere ostensible authority. The attempt to prove that Goldberg went to Fort Wayne on the 14th of February to make a settlement with the appellants with the knowledge and tacit approval of the president of the respondent company, in our opinion, wholly fails. Goldberg\u2019s own evidence, when carefully read, does not support it; and the evidence of Smith is distinctly against it. All the surrounding circumstances render it incredible that anything of the kind occurred.\nIt is, perhaps, not without significance that within eight days afterwards, i.e., on the 22nd of February, 1928, Goldberg sold out all his interest in the respondent company. There is no evidence whatever that the respondent company, or its president, had any knowledge or notice either of the so-called confirmation note or of the agreement for settlement signed by Goldberg until the 23rd of March, 1928, the date of the appellants\u2019 statement of defence and counterclaim, which set them up, and that they had not notice or knowledge of them prior to that time is the proper inference from all the circumstances in evidence.\nWe are not presently concerned with the ethics of the respondent\u2019s repudiation of the oral contract of the 30th of December, 1927. It is not setting up an equitable defence; it pleads, by way of legal defence, a purely statutory right to have the contract alleged evidenced in writing; and it must not be forgotten, as Scrutton L.J., says, in Thirkell v. Cambi[8], that:\nIt has often been said that the Statute of Frauds covers more frauds than it prevents. On the other hand those who have experience of disputes as to oral contracts and of findings rather prompted by sympathy than guided by evidence know the value of a statute which removes uncertainty as to the terms of a contract by prescribing that they shall be in writing; and it is a mistake in the administration of the law to whittle away this statute in order to do what is supposed to be justice in a particular case. The appeal, therefore, fails and will be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Luxenberg & Levinter.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Brown & Smith.\n[1] (1928) 63 Ont.

The old line was carried on a trestle, and the new line was to be supported by a fill on a site adjacent to the trestle, which was to be made with the earth excavated from a bluff on the northerly side of the ravine through which the cut was to pass. The contract stipulated for unit prices including \"overhaul per yard 1 cent\"; and contained this clause: \"12. The contract prices for the several classes of excavation shall be taken to include the cost of depositing the material in embankments, crib work, and all other expenses connected therewith except extra haul, which will only be paid for where it exceeds five hundred (500) feet, at so much per yard per additional one hundred feet ***.\" The appellant in excavating the cut proceeded from the foot of the northerly slope of the bluff, and by a circuitous route encircling the bluff on its westerly, southwesterly and southerly sides carried the earth to the site of the embankment. The appellant contended that it was entitled to be paid for \"overhaul\" at the rate mentioned, that is to say, at the rate of 1 cent per cubic yard for every 100 feet of haul calculated by reference to the length of the route actually followed in excess of 500 feet. The view of the contract advanced by the respondent was that the contract phrases \"extra haul\" and \"overhaul\" have, by usage, in construction contracts, or at all events in railway construction contracts, a special and specific meaning; and that they signify that the length of the haul in respect of which the contractor was entitled to charge for overhaul, was to be ascertained by taking the distance (measured along the centre line of the railway in process of construction) between the projections, first, of the centre of mass of earth, to be excavated in making the cut, and second, of the embankment, and deducting therefrom 500 feet; the projections being for this purpose the several points on the centre line nearest the respective centres of mass. The trial judge (40 B.C. Rep. 81) held that the usage alleged had not been established, and that the proper construction of the contract was that contended for by the appellant. The Court of Appeal ([1928] 3 W.W.R. 466) disagreed with this conclusion and accepted the view advanced by the respondent.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal ([1928] 3 W.W.R. 466), that the alleged usage had not been proven. It had been established that there was a practice widely followed of inserting in railway construction contracts a clause providing for the computation of payment for overhaul according to the method contended for by the respondent; but in the text books, engineering manuals and writings by engineers produced, there was no basis for the view that the effect of the words used in the present contract is, apart from such special stipulations, what is contended by the respondent. Usage, of course, where it is established, may annex an unexpressed incident to a written contract; but it must be reasonably certain and so notorious and so generally acquiesced in that it may be presumed to form an ingredient of the contract. Juggomohun Ghose v. Manickchund (7 Moore's Indian Appeals 263, at p. 282).\nHeld, also, that in substance, the question presented to the trial judge was whether there was evidence to satisfy him judicially that the alleged usage was, to quote the language of Banks L.J., in Laurie v. Dudin (95 L.J., K.B. 191, at 193), \"so all pervading and so reasonable and so well known that everybody doing business\" in railway construction \"must be assumed to know\" it, and to contract subject to it; and the finding of the trial judge should not have been disturbed by the appellate court.\nAt the trial, a report by the Deputy Minister of Railways and the Chief Engineer of the respondent, approving the appellant's system of handling the works, tendered by the appellant's counsel, was admitted and no exception to its admissibility was taken at any stage of the proceedings prior to the oral argument in this court. According to the record, counsel for the respondent was aware that the document could have been excluded if he had pressed an objection against it, and, moreover, he did not call either of the gentlemen who signed the report as a witness. If the objection had been pressed, the appellant's counsel would no doubt have felt obliged to call them as witnesses himself, as counsel for the respondent must have realized; but the latter seemed to have elected deliberately not to press the obvious objection to the document.\nHeld, that, in these circumstances, an exception to the admissibility of the report taken by the respondent's counsel before this court should be considered as being raised too late.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], reversing the judgment of the trial judge, Morrison J.[2], and dismissing the appellant's action to recover for work done under a railway construction contract.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nJ. W. de B. Farris K.C. for the appellant.\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. and R. W. Lane for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDUFF J.\u2014The controversies in this appeal relate to questions of fact turning to some extent upon the effect of documentary evidence, and in part upon an appreciation of the weight of oral evidence adduced at the trial; upon which the conclusions of the learned trial judge were set aside by the Court of Appeal.\nThe appellants had a contract with the respondents dated May 20, 1926, for a work on the respondents' line of railway, which work consisted of a cut and fill where the line crossed a deep ravine. The old line was carried on a trestle, and the new line was to be supported by a fill on a site adjacent to the trestle, which was to be made with earth excavated from a bluff, on the northerly side of the ravine, through which the cut was to pass.\nThe contract stipulated for unit prices including \"overhaul per yard 1 cent\"; and contained this clause:\n12. The contract prices for the several classes of excavation shall be taken to include the cost of depositing the material in embankments, crib work, and all other expenses connected therewith except extra haul, which will only be paid for where it exceeds five hundred (500) feet, at so much per yard per additional one hundred feet. No allowance or compensation whatever shall be due or paid to the contractor for any temporary roads, bridges or trestles he may make to facilitate his work.\nThe appellants in excavating the cut proceeded from the foot of the northerly slope of the bluff, and by a circuitous route encircling the bluff on its westerly, southwesterly and southerly sides carried the earth to the site of the embankment. The substantive issue is whether or not the appellants are entitled to be paid for \"overhaul\" at the rate mentioned, that is to say, at the rate of 1 cent per cubic yard for every 100 feet of haul calculated by reference to the length of the route actually followed in excess of 500 feet. The view of the contract advanced by the respondents is that the contract phrases \"extra haul\" and \"overhaul\" have, by usage, in construction contracts, or at all events in railway construction contracts, a special and specific meaning. They signify, according to this contention, to summarize it broadly, that the length of the haul in respect of which the contractor is entitled to charge for overhaul, is to be ascertained by taking the distance (measured along the centre line of the railway in process of construction) between the projections, first, of the centre of mass of the earth to be excavated in making the cut, and second, of the embankment, and deducting therefrom 500 feet; the projections being for this purpose the several points on the centre line nearest the respective centres of mass. The learned trial judge held that the usage alleged had not been established, and that the proper construction of the contract is that contended for by the appellants. The Court of Appeal disagreed with this conclusion and accepted the view advanced by the respondents.\nIf the learned trial judge was right, two further questions will require consideration. First, whether on the facts proved, the appellants have established their right to have their claim passed upon in the absence of a certificate by the engineer sanctioning it, and second, whether, assuming that to be so, the appellants' method of proceeding was an unnecessarily expensive one, or was dictated by the physical conditions of the work and by the terms of the contract as to the time of performance.\nI shall consider these questions in the order in which I have stated them. And first, as to the construction of the contract. Usage, of course, where it is established, may annex an unexpressed incident to a written contract; but it must be reasonably certain and so notorious and so generally acquiesced in that it may be presumed to form an ingredient of the contract, Juggomohun Ghose v. Manickchund[3]. In the Court of Appeal there was some disagreement with the view of the learned trial judge, that the respondents' contention as to the effect of the contract was based upon the alleged existence of usage or custom, both Martin J.A. and M. A. MacDonald J.A. expressing the opinion that they were confronted with a question of interpreta- tion, merely. The respondents themselves alleged the practice they sought to prove as a custom controlling the effect of the contract; and I do not know that it is very material whether you describe the subject of inquiry as a question of the existence of a usage imparting a special meaning to particular words when employed in contracts of a given class, or as a question as to the existence of a usage annexing an incident to such contracts in virtue of the presence of such words. I am disposed to think that the latter is the more apt description of the question presented in this case.\nIn substance, the question for the learned trial judge was whether there was evidence to satisfy him judicially that the alleged usage is, to quote the language of Banks L.J., in Laurie v. Dudin[4],\nso all pervading and so reasonable and so well known that everybody doing busines\nin railway construction \"must be assumed to know\" it, and to contract subject to it. I am not satisfied that the alleged usage has been established. There is no doubt that a practice widely prevails of inserting in railway construction contracts a clause providing for the computation of payment for overhaul according to the method contended for by the respondents; but in the text books, engineering manuals and writings by engineers produced, there is no basis for the view that the effect of the words used in the contract before us is, apart from such special stipulations, what is now contended. More than one of the witnesses called on behalf of the respondents admitted that he had never in his own experience encountered a case in which the earth excavated in making the cut had to be carried to the fill by a circuitous route, that is to say in which carriage along the line of railway was impracticable and the circuitous route was not adopted to serve the convenience of the contractor, where overhaul had not been calculated according to the length of the route actually traversed. Some said that they had never met a case in which carriage on that line was not practicable. Other witnesses gave instances in which overhaul had been calculated according to the rule advocated by the respondents, though a circuitous route had been followed for the con- venience of the contractor, but not because a shorter route was impracticable. The engineer in charge, McMillan, admitted he had never known a case of carriage by a circuitous route being compensated for on the basis of measurement along the line of the railway. He had, he stated, adopted this course on one occasion when the earth had been taken from a borrow pit, that is to say, from an excavation entirely outside the line of the railway; in that case he had measured the distance from the point on the railway nearest the borrow pit, to the centre of mass of the fill, but he admitted that the alleged usage had no relation to such a case; and that in principle he had been wrong.\nIt was argued, that a method of computation of overhaul commonly in use, described as the method by \"mass diagram,\" would be incapable of application to a case like the present unless the distance were measured along the centre line of the railway; and this, it is urged, is sufficient ground for treating that method of measurement as ordained by the contract. This argument involves obviously the proposition that the method of mass diagram is so essential to such computations, or at all events so universally employed as to require a direction to employ it to be implied as an incident of the contract. Taking the evidence as a whole, I do not think this has been established; but in any case there is evidence by witnesses called on behalf of the respondents which it was quite open to the learned trial judge to accept, that this method (by \"mass diagram\") is applicable or may be applicable for the purpose of computing compensation for overhaul where the material is taken from a place outside the line on the railway (\"a borrow pit\") where the distance taken is that of the actual haul; and one of the most important witnesses called on behalf of the respondents explicitly admits that such a case presents no distinction in principle from those cases where the earth is excavated on the line of the railway. Distinction in principle between the case of the \"borrow pit\" and the case before us is not suggested.\nThe appellants, on the other hand, called a number of engineers of long experience and high repute, who denied without qualification the existence of any usage such as that alleged. I refer particularly to the evidence of Mr. Hazen, the assistant chief engineer, of the Canadian National Railways. He stated that according to his experience, which had been chiefly in railway construction and which up to the time of the trial was of 39 years' duration, where it is impracticable to haul the excavated material from the cut to the fill along the line of the railway, and where a longer route is followed for this reason by the contractor, and not for his own convenience, the practice is to compute the compensation for overhaul by reference to the distance actually traversed, and not to the distance between the points on the centre line of the railway nearest the centres of mass measured along that line.\nOn this evidence the learned trial judge has held that the respondents failed to prove the alleged usage. I am unable myself to perceive any grounds, upon which, to quote the phrase of Scrutton L.J. in Laurie v. Dudin[5], the Court of Appeal could properly\ninterfere with the learned judge who saw the witnesses and heard them cross-examined and heard the way in which they gave their evidence.\nI may add that, with the learned trial judge, I am not satisfied by the evidence that there is any practice of measuring distance for computing overhaul in the manner contended for, so well recognized, so well known among persons engaged in railway construction, and so widely prevailing as to justify a presumption that everybody who enters into a contract for such work does so with the intention of being bound by that usage.\nI do not doubt, I may add, that the learned trial judge, in considering whether such a widely prevailing and generally recognized usage had been established, took into account, as he was entitled to do, the fact that neither the Deputy Minister, a railroad engineer of a life time's experience, nor Mr. Randall, the company's chief engineer, was called as a witness to affirm the existence of such a usage; or that he did not fail to note the rather discreditable effort of the respondents to create the impression in Mr. Hazen's mind that he would be guilty of some impropriety in stating, as a witness on behalf of the appellants, his view that no such usage exists.\nSecond, as to the absence of an engineer's certificate recognizing the appellant's claim. The pertinent clauses of the contract may conveniently be set out together, they are these:\n1. *** The word \"engineer\" shall mean the chief engineer of the company (unless otherwise specified), or his duly authorized agents limited by the particular duties respectively entrusted to them. ***\n8. The engineer shall be the sole judge of work and material in respect of both quantity and quality, and his decision on all questions in dispute with regard thereto shall be final, and no work under this contract shall be deemed to have been performed, nor materials nor other things provided, so as to entitle the contractor to payment therefor, until the engineer is satisfied therewith, and has issued to the contractor his certificate in writing in respect thereof.\n9. The work shall, in every particular, be under and subject to the control and supervision of the engineer; and all orders, directions or instructions, at any time given by the engineer with respect thereto, or concerning the conduct thereof, shall be by the contractor promptly and efficiently obeyed, performed and complied with to the satisfaction of the engineer. In particular, and without limiting the foregoing, the engineer shall have the right to control blasting operations, so as to protect the interests of the company, and to avoid injury or damage from excessive or improper blasting.\n10. The respective descriptions of work and materials, or portions of the works referred to, in or covered by the individual items in the schedule of prices embodied in the proposal annexed to this contract, include not only the particular kinds of work or materials mentioned in the said items, but also all and every kind of work, labour, tools, plant, materials, equipment and things, whatsoever necessary for the full execution, completion and delivery, ready for use, of such descriptions of work and materials, or of such respective portions of the works, in accordance with the said drawings and specifications and to the satisfaction of the engineer. The said schedule as a whole is designed to cover not only the particular descriptions of work and materials mentioned therein, but also all and every kind of work, labour, tools, plant, material, equipment and things whatsoever necessary for the full execution, completion and delivery, finished and ready for use, for the entire work as herein contracted for, in accordance with said drawings and specifications, and the satisfaction of the engineer; in case of dispute as to what work, labour, tools, plant, materials, equipment and things are included in the works contracted for, or in the said schedule, or any item thereof, the decision of the engineer shall be final and conclusive.\n***\n27. The company covenants with the contractor, that the contractor having in all respects complied with the provisions of this contract, will be paid for and in respect of the works the various prices set out in the schedule of prices embodied in the accepted proposal of the contractor hereto annexed.\n***\n28. Cash payments equal to about ninety per cent of the value of the work done, approximately estimated from progress measurements and computed at the applicable schedule prices, or the prices fixed with respect thereto, as the case may be, under the provisions of this contract, will be made to the contractor monthly, on the written certificate of the engineer stating that the work for, or on account of which, the certificate is granted, has been done, and stating the value of such work computed as above mentioned; and the said certificate shall be a condition precedent to the right of the contractor to be paid the said ninety per cent or any part thereof. The remaining ten per cent shall be retained until the final completion of the whole work to the satisfaction of the engineer, and will be paid within two months after such completion. The written certificate of the engineer, certifying to the final completion of the said works to his satisfaction, shall be a condition precedent to the right of the contractor to receive or to be paid the said remaining ten per cent or any part thereof.\nThe contractors appear to have commenced work under the contract in the beginning of July, 1926. A gentleman named McMillan appears to have acted from the outset as engineer in charge of this particular work, and to have been recognized as such by the directors of the respondent, although as far as we can see he was not formally appointed until December of that year. Not until much later, apparently not earlier than the end of March, 1927, was there a chief engineer of the company who intervened in the contract. The minutes of the directors show that on the 20th of July, 1926, the board decided that all progress estimates of the engineer in charge \"of the diversion at Mile 13.7\" should be submitted each month to the Deputy Minister of Railways for checking and for certification. There is no suggestion that the Deputy Minister of Railways, who signs as chief engineer of the railways as well as Deputy Minister, was ever appointed chief engineer of this company, and the resolution indicates that it was in his capacity as Deputy Minister that he was to check and certify the progress estimates. The engineer, for the purposes of the contract, as appears from the extracts already quoted, must be the chief engineer of the company or an agent of the chief engineer. The respondents allege in the statement of claim that McMillan was the \"engineer\" within the meaning and for the purposes of the contract. It is not alleged that he was chief engineer of the company, or that he was an agent of the chief engineer; admittedly he was not chief engineer and obviously he was not an agent of the chief engineer, prior at least to March, 1927, as there was no chief engineer to appoint an agent. Further, it is clear that McMillan had no authority even as agent of the company to grant progress certificates, all of which, in compliance with the resolution of the 20th July, 1926, down to the appointment of the chief engineer in 1927, are in fact the certificates of Mr. Griffith, the Deputy Minister. Authority under the contract, to give a binding decision as to the contractors' right to a certificate, McMillan had none.\nNo express authority is given to the engineer by the contract, to pass on any question as to the construction of the contract. As the engineer is to certify to the performance of the work contracted for as a condition precedent of the contractors' right to be paid, he is necessarily obliged to read the contract and understand it, but it is his duty to, and it is the right of the contractor, that he shall give effect to the provisions of the contract according to their proper legal construction; and his only authority to pass upon that construction arises from, and is incidental to his authority to grant or withhold a certificate. It may perhaps be right to observe, although it adds nothing to what has already been said, that McMillan, having no authority to grant certificates, or to decide upon the contractors' right to a certificate, was endowed with no authority, even incidentally, to bind anybody or affect anybody's rights under the contract, by his views as to its meaning.\nThe learned trial judge held that the\nboard of directors assumed the functions of the engineer under the contract.\nThat appears to be an inference fairly warranted by the correspondence and the resolutions passed by the board of directors; especially when read in light of the fact that for nine months after the signing of the contract, no engineer was appointed. In order of date these are as follows:\nJuly 13, 1926.\nMr. D.

Railway Co.,\nVancouver, B.C.\nIn answer to your letter of July 13, the contractor purposes and is making preparation to take out the cut north of the fill at 13.7 by hauling out of the north end of the cut around by the P.G.E. Railway track to the fill south of the cut in question.\nIn a short talk with him he said he expected to be paid overhaul on this route, as it is the only way to take the cut out given as reason why he should be so paid.\nHe was told that overhaul is a constant, the same as the number of cubic feet in a yard and that his contention could not be supported. Not much was said but he still had his idea in mind.\nThe route to be used lengthens the distance over a centre line direct haul by from 3,000 to 3,500 feet.\nD.

If it was the intention to allow overhaul by a direct line I should have been so advised at that time. I contend that the work cannot be effectively done by steam shovel in any other way and I am willing to submit the question to any practical two steam shovel men and abide by their decision.\nFor the above reasons I contend that overhaul must be allowed over the route the material has to be hauled and not over the direct line. If you decide otherwise, we may be compelled to close down the steam shovel part of the work. Please advise at your earliest convenience, and oblige,\nGEORGIA CONSTRUCTION CO., LTD.\nPer T. R. Nickson.\nSeptember 14, 1926.\nA letter was read from the Georgia Construction Company Limited protesting the decision of the directors that they could not consider any other than the shortest haul or nearest way and on motion, duly seconded, it was resolved that they be advised that we expect them to carry out the terms of their contract and that our interpretation of its conditions regarding overhaul is as previously advised.\nSeptember 15, 1926.\nGEORGIA CONSTRUCTION CO., LTD.,\nBank of Toronto Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\nI am in receipt of your letter of 10th inst. which was submitted to the board of directors at a meeting here yesterday and I am instructed to advise you that we expect you to carry out the terms of your contract and that our interpretation of its conditions regarding overhaul is as previously advised you by our Mr. D. McMillan, engineer in charge.\nT. KILPATRICK,\nGeneral Manager.\nNovember 23, 1926.\nMessrs. GEORGIA CONSTRUCTION CO., LTD.,\nBank of Toronto Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\nI beg to advise you that your letter of 12th instant was submitted to the board of directors at a meeting here yesterday and I was instructed to advise you that the board can see no reason for changing the decision made, which was communicated to you, at their meeting on July 20, namely, that no other than the shortest haul or nearest way would be considered.\nT. KILPATRICK,\nGeneral Manager. These resolutions and communications all point to the conclusion at which the learned trial judge arrived and expressed in the sentence quoted above.\nOn behalf of the respondents, it was argued that the directors did nothing more than accept the decision of McMillan. The learned trial judge, while accepting McMillan's statement in his letter, as the expression of his own opinion, did not accept the view advanced by the respondents as to the conduct of the directors; it was his view that the directors had taken the matter into their own hands, and had issued instructions to McMillan as their own agent concerning the interpretation of the contract. The oral evidence adduced by the respondents in support of their allegations that the board had treated McMillan as an independent umpire and had deferred to his decisions as such, was not regarded by the trial judge as of sufficient weight to overbear the inferences arising from the tone and substance of the documents and from the undisputed facts.\nI am not convinced that the learned trial judge was wrong; especially in view of the fact that neither Mr. Griffith, the Deputy Minister, who for nine months certified to the progress estimates, nor Mr. Rindal, who was appointed chief engineer, apparently in March, 1927, was called as a witness, although both of them must have had not a little knowledge of the relations between the board of directors and the company's engineers.\nBut the matter does not rest there. If McMillan had possessed power to certify under the contract, it is at least questionable whether he had not already disqualified himself, before the time came to grant a progress certificate, from passing upon the construction of the clause in question. At the trial he avowed without hesitation, that from the outset he had formed an opinion as to the effect of the clause, an opinion based upon his own experience, which had not, it appears, embraced a similar case, that is to say, any case in which compensation for a circuitous haul had been based upon the distance measured along the centre line of the railroad. This opinion was in accordance with the respondents' contention; he declared with emphasis that he had decided the question finally, without consulting other engineers, and that his mind was not open to influence from argument upon it. The following is a passage from McMillan's evidence.\nQ. Let me put it to you this way: You told me in discovery\u2014I don't want to need to refer to it\u2014that you had never known a case of this kind before?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. And you also told me on discovery that so far as your experience was concerned you had never known a case where material was measured any other way than the way it was actually hauled?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Yes, so this was the first time in all your experience where you were confronted with the problem of saying whether you should measure overhaul in a way other than it was hauled?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Yes, and at that time you had read no authorities on it, had you?\u2014A. Only in so far as I have followed the method used by the railway companies I was employed with.\nQ. But that didn't deal with this special case. Don't nod your head?\u2014A. No.\nQ. So that you hadn't any experience then to help you on this special case, had you?\u2014A. No.\nQ. And you at that time had no opportunity, or took occasion to read any authorities to post yourself on the question?\u2014A. No.\nQ. Nor had you sought the advice of any independent engineer to advise you in it?\u2014A. No.\nQ. No. Well now, acting as a judge between the bodies, you would, at that time, with your limited experience, be quite open to receiving further information as authority, wouldn't you?\u2014A. No, I didn't consider my experience limited.\nQ. You did not; and yet you tell me that you never have had experience to meet the case?\u2014A. No.\nQ. And you say that your mind was so settled then that if authorities had been shown you dealing with such special case that you would not have given them consideration?\u2014A. I didn't think authorities could be shown showing anything different.\nQ. I see, so your mind was settled on this thing which you have never had any experience with right from the start, you hadn't an open mind to consider any authorities if they were suggested to you?\u2014A. My mind was settled.\nQ. Your mind was settled, you were not open to any argument on the matter?\u2014A. No.\nQ. So that if the Manual of Engineering had been produced and stated contrary, it would not have had any effect on you?\u2014A. No.\nQ. If authorities like Mr. Hazen of the Canadian National Railway had been quoted to you, or if you had seen him personally and he had told you that in his experience\u2014that he had experience in special cases of this kind\u2014that it should be paid for, that would have had no effect on you?\u2014A. No.\nQ. So that you are prepared to say that you had decided without authority and without seeing any?\u2014A. No, I had the authority of my experience.\nQ. Well, tell me any case in your experience that touched the case?\u2014A. I had no experience that touched the case.\nQ. No, so that the authority of your experience, being none, that was sufficient for your purpose?\u2014A. The authorities of my experience taught me that in no other way was overhaul calculated. There is high authority for the proposition that an engineer or architect, who has lapsed into that attitude of mind, is disqualified from acting as umpire under such a contract as this. (Per Lindley L.J. in Jackson v. Barry Railway Co.[6].)\nAt a later stage a chief engineer was appointed, Mr. Rindal, and the appellants having in April, 1927, requested that the points in difference should be submitted to arbitration, a report was made by him in which he expressed an opinion which accorded with that expressed by the board of directors in its instructions to McMillan. But the board of directors long before that had assumed the function of chief engineer; they had thereby placed themselves in a position in which they were precluded from insisting on the observance of the stipulations of the contract requiring a certificate by an engineer clothed with authority under the contract.\nThe last question to be dealt with is that which arises upon the respondents' allegation that it was quite practicable to make the cut through the bluff by proceeding from the southerly slope, and in such a manner that the material excavated could be hauled to the fill by the direct route, that is to say, along the centre line of the railway.\nThe evidence is overwhelming that Nickson, the manager of the appellants, proceeded with the cut under the belief that this course was not practicable, and that the only practicable method was that adopted by him. He says that before the execution of the contract, he informed Kilpatrick, the respondents' superintendent, of his plan, and Kilpatrick, although he says he cannot remember this communication, will not deny that it took place. It is admitted that at no time did McMillan or Kilpatrick or any other person on behalf of the respondents, suggest to the appellants that their method was an unnecessarily expensive one. Indeed, it is not open to dispute that according to the view of the officials of the respondents, the appellants were proceeding in a proper and workmanlike manner. A report by Mr. Griffith, the Deputy Minister and chief engineer of the respondents on the 23rd of July, 1927, contains this paragraph: In view of the knowledge we now have of the material in the bottom of the cut, we believe that the system chosen by the contractors of handling the work is the only way in which the contract could be completed anywhere near the time allotted for the work and there is no doubt that the material placed in the embankment has been placed there at a loss.\nAn objection was raised on the argument as to the admissibility of this report, which I shall discuss presently. In a practical sense this expression of opinion seems to be conclusive. Mr. Griffith, as already mentioned, had for nine months been responsible for progress certificates, and was no doubt fully acquainted with the work in every detail. It was the duty of the contractors to endeavour to complete the work within the time specified by the contract, and if in order to accomplish that object they adopted what they conceived to be the only practicable means of doing so, and if their view was based upon reasonable grounds and they acted in entire good faith, they are entitled to be paid for what they did according to the terms of the contract. This report seems to be conclusive upon the point that their plan was reasonable and that they were right in adopting it. Even if one were convinced by considerations ex post facto, that another course would have proved less expensive, that is not a ground for depriving them of the compensation, when it appears that the measures they adopted were reasonable and necessary not only in their own view, but in the view of the officials of the railway company as well.\nAs to the admissibility of the report. The document was tendered by Mr. Farris, and although no objection was taken to its admissibility, counsel for the respondents remarked that the letter was \"without prejudice.\" The document was admitted and no exception to its admissibility was taken at any stage of the proceedings prior to the oral argument in this court. Obviously, counsel for the respondents was aware that the document could have been excluded if he had pressed an objection against it. And there appears to be not a little reason for thinking that he had his clients' interest in view in not doing so. I have already noticed the fact that the respondents called neither of the gentlemen who signed this report as a witness. Whatever be the explanation of that, no doubt the appellants had some good reason for not doing so. If the objection had been pressed, Mr. Farris would no doubt have felt obliged to call them as witnesses himself, as counsel for the respondents must have realized. He seems to have elected deliberately not to press the obvious objection to the document. In these circumstances, the objection comes, I think, too late.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the learned trial judge restored, with costs in all the courts.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Farris, Farris, Stultz & Sloan.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Mayers, Locke, Lane & Thomson.\n[1] [1928] 3 W.W.R. 466\n[2] (1928) 40 B.C.

The Court refused an application by the Crown to receive further evidence, under s. 3 of c. 9 of the Statutes of 1928 (Dom.), holding that no special ground existed to justify it.\nAPPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], holding that the plaintiff was entitled to recover from the defendant the amounts claimed for excise tax and sales tax in respect of beer alleged to have been manufactured and sold by defendant. The appeal was allowed.\nS. G. Slaght K.C. for the appellant.\nN. W. Rowell K.C. and Gordon Lindsay for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nLamont J.\u2014The sole question in this appeal is: Did the Crown in the court below on the evidence establish as against the appellant a statutory liability for the taxes sued for?\nThe action was brought to recover from the appellant the sum of $15,249.80 sales tax under s. 19BBB (1) of the Special War Revenue Act, 1915, and amendments, and $33,076.85 excise or gallonage tax under s. 19B 1 (b) of the same Act.\nIn the statement of claim the Crown alleged that the Brewing Company was, during the periods therein referred to, licensed to carry on the trade or business of a brewer. It also alleged that, on and after the first day of June, 1925, and prior to the first day of May, 1927, the company made sales of beer subject to the tax imposed by s. 19BBB (1), and thereby became liable to pay the tax. Further that the company had, during the same period, manufactured and sold beer subject to the tax imposed by s. 19B 1(b) and became, therefore, liable to pay that tax also. These sections in part read as follows:\u2014\n19BBB 1. In addition to any duty or tax that may be payable under this Part, or any other statute or law, there shall be imposed, levied and collected a consumption or sales tax of five per cent, on the sale price of all goods produced or manufactured in Canada, including the amount of excise duties when the goods are sold in bond, which tax shall be payable by the producer or manufacturer at the time of the sale thereof by him.\n* * *\nProvided that the consumption or sales tax specified in this section shall not be payable on goods exported.\n19B 1 (b). There shall be imposed, levied and collected upon all goods enumerated in Schedule II to this Part, when such goods are imported into Canada or taken out of warehouse or when any such goods are manufactured or produced in Canada and sold on and after the twenty-fourth day of May, one thousand nine hundred and twenty-two, in addition to any duty or tax that may be payable under this Act, or any other statute or law, the rate of excise tax set opposite to each item in said Schedule II.\n* * *\nProvided that such excise tax shall not be payable when such goods are manufactured for export, under regulations prescribed by the Minister of Customs and Excise.\nSchedule II provides that the rate of excise tax on beer shall be twelve and a half cents per gallon.\nA perusal of these sections makes it clear that under each of them the tax is imposed in respect of beer manufactured or produced in Canada and sold by the manufacturer or producer. The onus was, therefore, on the Crown to prove that the beer, in respect of which the taxes were claimed, had not only been sold by the company but had also been manufactured by it, unless such manufacture was admitted, or not denied. The statement of defence contains the following:\u2014\n(1) The Defendant does not admit that it was licensed to carry on the trade or business of a brewer or as such manufactured or sold beer.\n(5) The defendant does not admit that it manufactured or sold beer subject to any tax and denies that it became liable to pay to His Majesty any of the sums referred to in paragraph 5 of the Information.\n(6) The defendant expressly denies all the allegations contained in the Information herein and denies that any taxes or moneys are due or owing as alleged therein.\nThis defence was notice to the Crown that the company was not admitting anything and would require the Crown to establish the liability of the company to pay the tax.\nWe have carefully examined the evidence submitted on behalf of the Crown (no evidence was given on behalf of the company) but are unable to find anything therein which, in our opinion, establishes, either expressly or inferentially, that the company had manufactured the beer in respect of which the taxes are claimed. The only evidence of manufacture was that given by A. E. Nash, a member of the accounting firm of Clarkson, Gordon, Gilfoyle & Nash, which firm had been retained by the Crown to make an examination of the company\u2019s books. Mr. Nash, among other questions, was asked:\u2014\nQ. Has your firm made an examination of the accounts of defendants, the Sarnia Brewing Company, with a view of ascertaining the Crown\u2019s claim for gallonage and sales tax?\u2014A. They have.\nQ. Were you able to ascertain from the books of the Company the number of gallons manufactured and sold by them from the time they commenced business in 1925 up to the 30th of April, 1927, the period covered by the Information?\u2014A. Yes.\n* * * Q. Then did you take off from the books, and prepare from the books, a statement showing the number of gallons produced and sold month by month during that period?\u2014A. Yes, we did.\nThat statement was put in as Ex. No. 1. On cross-examination, however, Nash admitted that he had not personally examined the books or vouchers of the appellant, nor any of the documents on which Ex. No. 1 was based. Not having examined the company\u2019s books or documents, he was not in a position to testify as to what information could be ascertained from them. His evidence, therefore, in so far as it was directed towards establishing that the company had manufactured the beer sold by it, cannot be said to have any probative force.\nThe only other witness who gave evidence was G. R. Troop, who had personally examined the books, vouchers and documents of the company. Troop testified that he had verified in the company\u2019s books the figures that appeared in Ex. No. 1, that those figures were correct and had been taken by him from the books of the brewery. Unfortunately the books themselves were not put in evidence and an examination of Troop\u2019s evidence and of Ex. No. 1 fails to disclose any reference whatever in either of them to the manufacture or production of the beer.\nThe learned President of the Exchequer Court held that the evidence of Troop and Ex. No. 1 established that the beer in question had been manufactured and sold by the company. They did, without doubt, establish that it had been sold, but, as there is no reference in either of them to the manufacture of the beer, we are unable to find that such manufacture was established. The learned President evidently overlooked the defect in the Crown\u2019s proof, for in his judgment he says:\nThe real question for determination here is, upon whom lies the onus of establishing what, if any, of the goods in question, were sold for export and in fact exported, and therefore coming within the exemptions from taxation.\nThe company was contending that the onus was on the Crown not only to prove the sale of the beer, but also to prove that it had not been manufactured for export; while the contention of the Crown was that the onus was on the company to bring itself within the provisos of the sections quoted, in part, above. Nothing, however, was said or done at the trial on behalf of the company to mislead the Crown or to relieve it of the obligation of proving every fact necessary to establish the company\u2019s liability to pay the tax. That obligation, as we have said, involved proving that the company had manufactured the beer sold, and we are of opinion that the Crown failed to prove it. The parties were always at arms\u2019 length.\nOn behalf of the Crown we were asked to receive further evidence of manufacture if the court should be of opinion that it had not been sufficiently proved.\nSection 3 of chapter 9 of the Statutes of 1928 (Can.) authorizes this Court, in its discretion, on special grounds, and by special leave, to receive further evidence on a question of fact. In this case, however, we are unable to find the existence of any special ground which would justify the receiving of further evidence.\nThe appeal, in our opinion, should be allowed and the action dismissed. The appellant is entitled to the costs in the court below but, as it raised no question there as to the absence of proof of manufacture, there will be no costs of this appeal.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Slaght & Cowan.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W. Stuart Edwards.\n[1] [1928] Ex. C.R. 219.\n",

The action was brought more than a year, but within two years, after the time of the accident. The claim consisted of $4,780 for expenses incurred by the community in medical and hospital care; of $118 for the value of clothing, etc., destroyed in the accident, alleged to be the property of the community; and of $10,000 for damages due to the loss of services of the injured brother. The trial judge assessed the respondent\u2019s damages at $4,000, of which $2,236.90 was allowed for out-of-pocket expenses, and the balance on account of the claim for other damages; and this decision was affirmed by the appellate court. It was also found by the trial judge and unanimously upheld on appeal that the injury was attributable to fault and negligence of an employee of the appellant for which it was responsible; and no appeal was taken to this court against that finding. The questions arising on this appeal are, (a) whether the respondent has, or ever had, the right of action which it asserts; and, (b) whether its claim is barred in whole or in part by the limitation provision of par. 2 of art. 2262 C.C.\nHeld, (affirming in part the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Q.O.R. 46 K.B. 96)), that the respondent has a right of action against the appellant company, but that it is entitled to recover only the sum of $2,236.90 for the expenses incurred by it as a result of the injuries sustained by the member of the community. Mignault and Rinfret JJ. dissenting.\nHeld, also, Mignault and Rinfret JJ. dissenting, that the plaintiff was within the purview of the word \u201canother\u201d (\u201cautrui\u201d) as used in article 1053 C.C., and therefore entitled to maintain this action. Article 1053 C.C. confers on every person, who suffers injury directly attributable to the fault of a third person as its legal cause, the right to recover from the latter the damages sustained. The suggestion that the right of recovery under that article should be restricted to the \u201cimmediate victim\u201d of the tort involves a departure from the golden rule of legal interpretation (Beal, Legal Interpretation, 3rd ed., p. 80) by refusing to the word \u201canother\u201d (\u201cautrui\u201d) in article 1053 C.C. its ordinary meaning; and such interpretation would be highly dangerous and would result in the rejection of meritorious claims. Moreover, it is not necessary so to restrict the scope of article 1053 C.C. in order to give full operation to the terms of article 1056 C.C., as nothing in this latter article suggests an intent to narrow the scope of article 1053 C.C., save \u201cwhere the person injured * * * dies in consequence\u201d and the claim is for \u201cdamages occasioned by such death.\u201d\nHeld, also, that the respondent\u2019s action is not prescribed. The action is \u201cfor damages resulting from * * * (a) quasi-offence\u201d and is prescribed by two years only (article 2261 (2) C.C.), and is not one for \u201cbodily injuries\u201d prescribed by one year (article 2262 (2) C.C.). Mignault and Rinfret JJ. not expressing any opinion.\nPer Anglin C.J.C. and Smith J.\u2014The provisions of article 1056 C.C. may not be necessary to support the actions for which it provides; but their presence cannot justify narrowing the purview of the clear terms in which article 1053 C.C. is couched, except so far as may be necessary to exclude from it the special cases for which article 1056 C.C. provides. The respondent is entitled to be adequately compensated on the footing of loss of benefits reasonably to be expected from a continuance of the services of the injured member. The appeal should be dismissed with costs. Per Mignault and Rinfret JJ. (dissenting).\u2014The respondent had no status to bring the action, which should have been dismissed by the trial judge. Article 1056 C.C., together with article 1053 C.C., covers the whole ground of liability in cases of bodily injuries and both articles must be construed together. Article 1053 C.C. establishes the foundation upon which such liability will rest, and article 1056 C.C. enacts in what circumstances and in favour of what persons the liability will exist. Therefore, it follows that the word \u201cautrui\u201d (\u201canother\u201d) in article 1053 C.C. connotes \u201cla partie contre qui le d\u00e9lit ou quasi-d\u00e9lit a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis\u201d (\u201cthe person injured by the commission of an offence or a quasi-offence\u201d) contained in article 1056 C.C.; and that person cannot be any other than the \u201cimmediate victim.\u201d In the province of Quebec, in cases of bodily injuries caused by fault, the right of action belongs solely to the \u201cimmediate victim\u201d during his lifetime and, after his death, exclusively to the persons enumerated in article 1056 C.C.\nPer Mignault and Rinfret JJ. (dissenting).\u2014The respondent might have had a right to recover the amount of expenses incurred by it for medical and hospital care, by means of the action de in rem verso; but, as such, it would be prescribed by the expiry of one year under article 2262 (2) C.C. Anglin C.J.C. and Smith J. dubitantibus.\nPer Lamont J.\u2014The respondent cannot succeed as to its claim for loss of services. To be entitled to maintain such an action, a legal right to such services, and the loss thereof, must be established. The contractual relation of master and servant did not subsist between the respondent and the injured brother and, upon the evidence, neither the brother nor the Congregation ever considered they were creating any legal relationship between them. Therefore, the fault of the appellant company did not deprive the respondent of the brother\u2019s services, to which it had no legal right. Anglin C.J.C. and Smith J. contra.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], affirming the judgment of the trial judge, Surveyer J., and maintaining the respondent\u2019s action in damages for $4,000.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nA. Geoffrion K.C. and L. Faribault K.C. for the appellant.\nJ. Cartier for the respondent.\nAnglin C.J.C\u2014The plaintiff (respondent) is a religious community incorporated by statute of the province of Quebec (50 Vic, c. 29) and possesses, as an incident of its corporate entity, the capacity to sue and be sued (s. 4). The defendant (appellant) is a common carrier engaged in the business of furnishing transportation for passengers by taxicab and omnibus. Brother Henri-Gabriel, a member of the plaintiff community, sustained serious injury, while travelling in an omnibus of the defendant, on the 14th of August, 1923.\nIt was found by the trial judge, and unanimously affirmed by the Court of King\u2019s Bench[2], that the injury sustained by Brother Henri-Gabriel was attributable to fault and negligence of an employee of the defendant for which it was responsible; and against that finding no appeal has been taken here.\nThe present action was brought to recover damages sustained by the community in consequence of Brother Henri-Gabriel being so injured. The claim consists of three parts: first, the sum of $4,780 expended by the community in medical and hospital care for the injured brother and in providing him with such necessaries as spectacles, etc.; second, the sum of $118 for the value of clothing and other personal effects, the property of the community, destroyed in the accident; and, third, the sum of $10,000 for other actual damages due to loss of services of Brother Henri-Gabriel, etc.\nThe learned trial judge (Surveyer J.) assessed the plaintiffs damages at $4,000, of which amount the sum of $2,236.90 was allowed for out-of-pocket expenses, admittedly incurred by the plaintiff as a necessary result of the injuries sustained by Brother Gabriel, and the balance on account of the claim for other actual damages.\nThis judgment was confirmed by the Court of King\u2019s Bench2, although two members of that court, Mr. Justice Greenshields and Mr. Justice Cousineau (ad hoc), would have reduced the recovery\u2014the latter to the sum of $2,236.90 allowed for out-of-pocket expenses, to which Mr. Justice Greenshields would, however, add the sum of $900 to cover an expenditure of the respondent in replacing Brother Henri-Gabriel on its teaching staff.\nTwo questions arise on the present appeal, viz., (1) whether the plaintiff has, or ever had, the right of action which it asserts; and (2) whether its claim is barred in whole or in part by the limitation provision of paragraph (2) of article 2262 of the Civil Code, which reads as follows:\nThe following actions are prescribed by one year:\n* * *\n(2) for bodily injuries, saving the special provisions contained in article 1056 and cases regulated by special laws.\nThe plaintiff being endowed, as a body corporate, with the capacity to sue, the question on the first branch of the appeal is whether it has a right of action to recover the damages it now claims.\nArticles 1053 and 1054 C.C. read as follows:\n1053. Every person capable of discerning night from wrong is responsible for the damage caused by his fault to another, whether by positive act, imprudence, neglect or want of skill.\n1054. He is responsible not only for the damage caused by his own fault, but also for that caused by the fault of persons under his control.\nIs the present plaintiff, under the circumstances in evidence, within the purview of the word \u201canother\u201d (\u201cautrui\u201d) as used in article 1053 C.C.? Such is the issue on this branch of the appeal.\nA plaintiff has a right of action for all damages sustained by him against any person guilty of fault which caused such damages. (S. 1924.1.160; Zach., vol. 4 (Mass\u00e9 et Verge, 1858) nos. 625-7; Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Robinson)[3]. Article 1053 C.C. says so in terms so explicit that to deny the existence of such a right as that set up in the present action involves placing a restriction upon the prima facie generality of the language in which it is couched (8 De Lorimier, Bib., C.C., pp. 203-14), and which formulates the common law theretofore existing. Ravary v. Grand Trunk Ry. Co.[4].\nThe only alternative view suggested is that the right of recovery under art. 1053 C.C. should be restricted to \u201cthe immediate victim\u201d of the tort of the defendant. (I use the phrase \u201cimmediate victim\u201d for lack of a better\u2014M. Demogue (Obligations, t. 4, no. 528) refers to \u201cla victime mat\u00e9rielle\u201d). Indeed, there can be no logical half-way position between so restricting the application of the article and admitting that, standing alone, it confers on every person, who suffers injury directly attributable to the fault of a third person as its legal cause, the right to recover from the latter the damages sustained. It must not be forgotten that on the principle enunciated in arts. 1053-4-5 C.C. depends practically the whole law of tort in Quebec, covering alike wrongs against person, property, honour and reputation, article 1053 C.C. embodying the general common law of the province on this subject. Articles 1054 and 1055 C.C. provide for vicarious responsibility, cover particular cases and create certain liabilities conditionally defeasible. Quebec L.H. & P. Co. v. Vandry[5]. Accordingly, to narrow the prima facie scope of art. 1053 C.C. is highly dangerous and would necessarily result in most meritorious claims being rejected; many a wrong would be without a remedy. To those who urge the danger and inconvenience in multiplicity of actions and other evils which might result from giving to the word \u201canother\u201d (\u201cautrui\u201d) in art. 1053 C.C. its ordinary and unrestricted meaning, I reply, adapting the words of Lord Sumner in Vandry\u2019s case[6].\nTo all this the plain words of the article, if they are plain as their Lordships conceive them to be, are a sufficient answer. In enacting the Code the Legislature may have foreseen cases of the kind now in question many years before any of them arose * * * The positive words of the article stand and must have effect.\nSee, too, Fuz-Herm. III, Cod. Civ. Ann., arts. 1382-3, no. 694 (infra). The courts may be trusted to discourage un-meritorious claims.\nAs Sir Fran\u00e7ois Langelier says, in his well known work on the Civil Law of Quebec, vol. III, at p. 468,\nPour qu\u2019un d\u00e9lit ou un quasi-d\u00e9lit donne lieu \u00e0 une action en dommages, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que ces dommages (sic) soient caus\u00e9s \u00e0 la personne m\u00eame qui les r\u00e9clame: il suffit que la cons\u00e9quence en rejaillisse sur elle, alors que le d\u00e9lit ou le quasi-d\u00e9lit a port\u00e9 sur une autre. C\u2019est ainsi, par exemple, qu\u2019une compagnie d\u2019assurance a une action en dommages contre l\u2019auteur de l\u2019incendie d\u2019une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait assur\u00e9e. Le mari a une action en dommages pour les dommages caus\u00e9s \u00e0 sa femme. Le p\u00e8re a une action en dommages pour les dommages caus\u00e9s \u00e0 ses enfants. Il a m\u00eame \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9, il y a une trentaine d\u2019ann\u00e9es, par la Cour de Cassation, que les parents m\u00eame collat\u00e9raux de quelqu\u2019un qui est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 ont une action en dommages contre ceux qui ont attaqu\u00e9 sa m\u00e9moire. Mgr. Dupanloup, le c\u00e9l\u00e8bre \u00e9v\u00eaque d\u2019Orl\u00e9ans, fut condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 payer des dommages \u00e0 la famille de Mgr. Rousseau, un de ses pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseurs d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 depuis longtemps, parce qu\u2019il avait outrag\u00e9 sa m\u00e9moire.\nEn un mot, pour que celui qui n\u2019a pas souffert directement de la faute d\u2019un autre ait une action en dommages, il suffit qu\u2019il ait eu un int\u00e9r\u00eat actuel, moral ou mat\u00e9riel, \u00e0 ce que cette faute ne soit pas commise. Mignault, in his work, \u201cDroit Civil Canadien,\u201d vol. 5, at pp. 333-4, says:\nQuiconque, par sa faute, cause un dommage \u00e0 autrui, est oblig\u00e9 de le r\u00e9parer. * * * La faute est tout ce qui blesse injustement le droit d\u2019autrui. Elle peut, donc, consister dans une action ou dans une omission d\u2019action. La faute est un d\u00e9lit lorsque l\u2019agent du dommage Ta caus\u00e9 avec intention; un quasi-d\u00e9lit, dans le cas contraire. * * * Le quasi-d\u00e9lit est l\u2019acte volontaire et illicite d\u2019une personne qui, par imprudence ou n\u00e9gligence, cause du dommage \u00e0 autrui.\nThe present action is founded on a quasi-d\u00e9lit.\nAn instance of the broad application of art. 1053 C.C. occurs in the judgment of Mathieu J., in Larriv\u00e9 v. La-pierre[7], in an action by a father to recover damages personally sustained by him because of an injury to his son. We find, at pp. 4, 5, the following consid\u00e9rants:\nConsid\u00e9rant que, par l\u2019article 1053 du Code Civil, toute personne capable de discerner le bien du mal est responsable du dommage caus\u00e9 par sa faute \u00e0 autrui, soit par son fait, soit par son imprudence, n\u00e9gligence ou inhabilit\u00e9 et que, par l\u2019article 1054, elle est responsable non seulement du dommage qu\u2019elle cause par sa faute, mais encore de celui caus\u00e9 par les choses qu\u2019elle a sous sa garde;\nConsid\u00e9rant que Je demandeur all\u00e8gue, dans sa d\u00e9claration, que l\u2019accident dont il est question a eu lieu par la faute du d\u00e9fendeur, qui se serait servi dans sa manufacture d\u2019une machine impropre \u00e0 l\u2019usage duquel il l\u2019employait;\nConsid\u00e9rant que le demandeur all\u00e8gue que, par suite de cet accident, il est priv\u00e9 du salaire de son fils qui le faisait vivre, et qu\u2019il \u00e9prouve des dommages directs au montant de deux cents piastres;\nConsid\u00e9rant que les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats doivent comprendre, non seulement la r\u00e9paration du pr\u00e9judice \u00e9prouv\u00e9 par la partie l\u00e9s\u00e9e, mais aussi celui que souffre la famille, lorsque le fait dommageable rejaillit sur elle, et que tous ceux auxquels le fait a caus\u00e9 un dommage sont admis \u00e0 r\u00e9clamer;\nConsid\u00e9rant que de demandeur all\u00e8gue qu\u2019il a \u00e9prouv\u00e9 un pr\u00e9judice personnel de l\u2019accident arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 son enfant qui l\u2019a emp\u00each\u00e9 de travailler, et qu\u2019il est ainsi priv\u00e9 du b\u00e9n\u00e9fice qu\u2019il retirait du travail de son dit enfant;\nConsid\u00e9rant qu\u2019entre le p\u00e8re et le fils, il y a obligation, de la part de ce dernier, de fournir des aliments au premier, et que, tant en raison de cette obligation, qu\u2019en raison des circonstances particuli\u00e8res all\u00e9gu\u00e9es dans la d\u00e9claration, et, sp\u00e9cialement du fait qu\u2019il vivait du salaire de son fils, cet accident lui a caus\u00e9 un pr\u00e9judice r\u00e9el.\nAgain, in Sheehan v. Bank of Ottawa[8], reversed on another ground[9], although the judgment should probably have been rested on art. 1056 C.C., a similar right under art. 1053 C.C. was recognized for a father whose son had been shot by a young man to whom the bank had negligently entrusted a revolver. Fault causing damage entails delictual responsibility; without fault, actual or presumed (except in the case of damage caused by things under defendant\u2019s care), such responsibility does not exist: Allard v. Frigon[10]. In both the above instances the right of recovery under art. 1053 C.C., was not restricted to \u201cthe immediate victim\u201d of the defendant\u2019s fault.\nMoreover, with the utmost respect for those who think that the words \u201cto another\u201d (\u201c\u00e0 autrui\u201d) of art. 1053, C.C., should be construed as embracing only \u201cthe person injured\u201d (la partie contre qui le d\u00e9lit ou quasi-d\u00e9lit a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis), i.e., \u201cthe immediate victim\u201d of a tort of the defendant, to the exclusion of others who also suffer damages directly attributable to such tort (e.g. the master who loses the benefit of the services of his injured employee, (Demogue, Obligations, t. 4, no. 530)\u2014the husband, separate as to property, whose affections have been outraged by the ravishment of his wife), this suggested restriction on the purview of these words involves a departure from the golden rule of legal construction, applicable to all writings, that\nthe grammatical and ordinary sense of the words is to be adhered to, unless that would lead to some absurdity, or some repugnance or inconsistency with the rest of the instrument, in which case (that) sense may be modified so as to avoid that absurdity, and inconsistency, but no further (Beal, Legal Interpretation, 3rd ed., p. 80).\nThe words \u201cto another\u201d (\u201c\u00e0 autrui\u201d) of art. 1053 C.C. are clear and present no ambiguity.\nBut, it is said, the decision of the Privy Council in the Vandry case[11], and Article 1018 C.C., applicable by analogy, require us to read art. 1056 C.C. with art. 1053 C.C., and it is urged that, in order to give to art. 1056 C.C. some operation, the scope of the words under discussion in art. 1053 C.C. should be so restricted as to cover only \u201cthe immediate victim\u201d of the tort\u2014at least where the claim arises out of bodily injuries. I shall proceed at once to consider the argument based on the presence of art. 1056 in the Civil Code, as it was practically the sole ground urged for the restriction of the purview of art. 1053 C.C. and the rejection of all the French authorities which give to the word \u201cautrui\u201d its prima facie meaning, the Code Napol\u00e9on containing no provision corresponding to art. 1056 C.C. No doubt, \u201cthe plainest words may be controlled by a reference to the context\u201d (Beal, Ibid., pp. 83, 84); noscuntur a sociis; but not only must the words to be so controlled be consistent with the suggested limitation, Garbutt v. Durham Joint Committee[12], but\nyou must have the context even more plain, or at least as plain * * * as the words to be controlled\nBentley v. Rotherham and Kimberworth Local Board[13], These principles of legal interpretation, being founded on common sense, apply equally under the civil and the common law systems. (De Chassat, Interpr\u00e9tation des Lois, (1822) pp. 100, 205 et seq.; Langelier, Droit Civ., vol. 1, pp. 20, 22 and 91; art. 12 C.C.\nA difference between the two authentic versions of the text of art. 1056 C.C.\u2014the words \u201cascendant and descendant relations\u201d of the English version (which would include grand-parents and grand-children) being translated in the French text \u201cp\u00e8re, m\u00e8re et enfants\u201d\u2014is not here material. (See s. 6 of c. 78 of Con. Stats. (1859) of Canada; and Bonin v. The King[14]. There is nothing in art. 1056 C.C. that suggests an intent to narrow the scope of art. 1053 except \u201cwhere the person injured * * * dies in consequence\u201d and the claim is for \u201cdamages occasioned by such death\u201d; and the chief purpose of art. 1056 may well have been to preclude such claims, which would often be preferred on flimsy grounds, by persons other than those designated in art. 1056 C.C., who might otherwise regard them as within the purview of art. 1053 C.C. Hunter v. Gingras[15]. Given that effect, art. 1056 C.C. has a distinct and useful office; and, so treating it, there is no infraction of the provision of the golden rule, that the grammatical and ordinary sense of plain and unambiguous terms is not to be modified to a greater extent than is necessary to avoid absurdity, repugnance or inconsistency. Notwithstanding any apparent violence to logic in excluding claims by persons other than those named in art. 1056 C.C., when the immediate victim of the tort dies, for damages occasioned by his death, while allowing all who sustain direct loss to claim, if the immediate victim survives, there is not here such inconsistency, repugnance or absurdity as requires the courts to deny their plain meaning and effect to the words of article 1053 C.C., Abley v. Dale[16].\nMoreover, it seems to me not improbable, although article 1056 C.C. differs in some important respects from Lord Campbell\u2019s Act of 1846 (Miller v. Grand Trunk Ry. Co.)[17], that its predecessor, viz., chapter 6 of the Statutes of Canada (1847), 10-11 Vic. (c. 78 of the Con. Stats, of Can., 1859), was imported into the law of Quebec from the English Statute (Robinson v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[18]), either in order to forestall defences based on the maxim \u201cactio personalis moritur cum persona\u201d or, rather, on the quaint (Lord Sumner outlined its history in Admiralty Commissioners v. S.S. \u201cAmerika,\u201d[19]), and, in the view of ardent civilians, probably the crude, if not semi-barbarous, doctrine of the English common law (See observations of Farwell, L.J., in Jackson v. Watson[20])\u2014ex morte hominis non oritur actio; Baker v. Bolton[21]; Admiralty Commissioners v. S.S. \u201cAmerika\u201d[22], which might be invoked by some defendant to an action within the scope of that article, or to assimilate in this particular the law of Upper and of Lower Canada, Canadian Pacific Ry. Co. v. Robinson[23]. In English law, as clearly appears in the two English cases last cited, damages sustained by the plaintiff before the death of the immediate victim are recoverable, although his death in consequence of the injury should subsequently ensue. The actions for which it provides art. 1056 C.C. itself expressly styles \u201cindependent\u201d (a) i.e., personal (Miller v. Grand Trunk Ry. Co.17), and without effect, whether by way of assistance or of defeasance, on other rights of action (except actions by persons other than those named in art. 1056 C.C. \u201cfor damages occasioned by such death,\u201d which its terms no doubt preclude), the maxim \u201cexpressio unius est exclusio\n(a) The French translation (Preface to Civil Code\u20141867\u2014by Thomas McCord, one of the secretaries of the Codifying Commission, pp. VIII and IX) of the last paragraph of art. 1056 C.C. is glaringly inaccurate and misleading. alterius\u201d being applicable and the words of art. 1056 C.C. \u201call damages\u201d being given due effect. To support the actions for which it provides article 1056 C.C. may have been unnecessary; and we are not unfamiliar with otiose provisions in legislation. The presence of such a provision, whether introduced per incuriam or ex majore cautela, cannot, I think, justify cutting down the purview of the clear terms in which article 1053 C.C. is couched, except so far as may be necessary to exclude from it the special cases for which article 1056 C.C. provides. (Art. 2613 C.C.) Had the legislature intended to exclude from the application of art. 1053 C.C. other cases so plainly within its ex facie purview, as is that at bar, a more direct method would assuredly have been found to effectuate that purpose.\nThe suggestion that, because the damages claimed could not reasonably have been foreseen by the defendant, they cannot be recovered, seems to indicate a confusion of the bearing of such considerations on the determination of the question of the existence of negligence or fault on the part of the defendant, where they may often be of moment, with their application to the measure of compensation, where, responsibility having been admitted or established, they are quite immaterial. Here the negligence or fault of the defendant and its responsibility to those thereby injured, who are within the scope of art. 1053 C.C., is no longer in question. Merely as illustrative of this view reference may be permissible to the very recent judgment of the Appellate Division (Ontario) in Harding v. Edwards et al[24], and to an English case therein discussed:. In re Polemis and Furness, Withy & Co.[25], since the decision in which, says Mr. Justice Middleton, at p. 105 of the report of the Ontario case:\nThat which had been in earlier cases indicated as exonerating the defendant from liability, that the damage was too remote because it could not reasonably have been anticipated as a consequence of the wrongful act done, can no longer be urged as a defence. The causal connection in the Polemis case25 was clearly shewn, but the damnum would not have resulted had there not been a most extraordinary and unforeseeable concurrence of contributing factors. None of these factors in that case was the conscious intervention of a third party. The court adopted as the basis of its decision what had been said by Lord Summer in the case of Weld-Blundell v. Stephens[26]: What a defendant ought to have contemplated as a reasonable man is material when the question is whether or not he was guilty of negligence. * * * This, however, goes to culpability, not to compensation; and by Sir Samuel Evans in H. M. S. London[27]: The court is not concerned in the present case with any inquiry as to the chain of causes resulting in the creation of a legal liability from which such damages as the law allows would flow. The tortious act\u2014i.e. the negligence of the defendants which imposes upon them a liability in law for damages\u2014is admitted. This gets rid at once of an element which requires consideration in a chain of causation in testing the question of legal liability, namelly, the foresight or anticipation of the reasonable man. * * * When it has been once determined that there is evidence of negligence, the person guilty of it is equally liable for the consequences, whether he could have foreseen them or not.\nI would refer to an earlier decision of Lord Sumner, when he was Lord Justice Hamilton, in Latham v. R. Johnson & Nephew, Ltd.,[28] where he says, at p. 413: \u201cChildren acting in the wantonness of infancy and adults acting on the impulse of personal peril may be and often are only links in a chain of causation extending from such initial negligence to the subsequent injury. No doubt each intervener is a causa sine qua non, but unless the intervention is a fresh, independent cause, the person guilty of the original negligence will still be the effective cause.\nSee too Great Lakes SS. Co. v. Maple Leaf Milling Co.[29].\nWhile judgments resting on English law are not authoritative in determining Quebec cases of which the decision rests upon the principles of the civil law, there would seem to be no good ground for excluding from consideration in a Quebec case the reasoning on which rest the conclusions reached in England and in Ontario, respectively, in the two decisions cited. Moreover the Court of Review expressed the like opinion in 1916 in Makkinge v. Robitaille[30]\u2014a case of liability ex contractu. So, too, while arr\u00eats of the French courts are not binding authority in our courts (Maclaren v. Att. Gen. for Quebec[31]; McArthur v. Dominion Cartridge Co.[32], nevertheless they are entitled to the most respectful consideration at our hands where, as here, the texts of law which they expound (art. 1382-1383 C.N.) are substantially the same as, and are the prototypes (1st Report of the Codification Commissioners, (1865) vol. 1, p. 16) of that of the Civil Code of Quebec (art. 1053 C.C.), Shawinigan Carbide Co. v. Doucet[33], per Fitzpatrick, C.J.; Quebec L., H. & P. Co. v. Vandry[34]. That, excluding such contingencies as Brother Henri-Gaibriel\u2019s premature death or abandonment of his religious vocation, the plaintiff had a reasonable expectation, amounting to a moral certitude, that it would enjoy the full benefit of his services during the two years immediately following his injury, admits of no doubt; and that such expectation of gain or advantage (whether the legal character of the relationship borne by the injured brother to the respondent should be regarded as that of an employee or as that of an associ\u00e9 (Rev. Trim., 1902, p. 904, n. 44) ) having been unlawfully interfered with by the act of the defendant (Beullac, C. C. P. Ann., art. 77, nos. 5 and 15), suffices to create the interest requisite to give a status to sue (art. 77 C.C.P.) for damages caused by such harmful interference, is, I think, in the Civil Law equally clear. Contra spoliatorem omnia praesumuntur.\nAny difficulty that might be suggested because of the fact that the plaintiff is a religious congregation is fully met by the statutory incorporation of the Quebec community to which Brother Henri-Gabriel belonged. (See Fuzier-Herman, Rep., vbo. Comm. Relig., nos. 119, 234). The contract, or arrangement, under which he became a member of the community and undertook to place his services entirely at its disposal in return for the obligation on its part to maintain him and provide him with all necessaries, etc., gave to the plaintiff an interest in his health and welfare sufficient to justify its claim for damages occasioned by inability on his part to render to it the services stipulated for caused by fault of the defendant. (Ibid., 190 bis, 191). Indeed that right seems to be a necessary correlative of the civil responsibility of religious communities for delicts or quasi-delicts of one of their members \u201cdans l\u2019exercise des fonctions auxquelles elles l\u2019ont pr\u00e9pos\u00e9.\u201d (Ibid., no. 460).\nThat a plaintiff, holding towards another, who is injured by the fault of a third party, relations such as those which his community had with Brother Henri-Gabriel, has a cause of action against such third party for damages sustained by him through the fault of such third party seems to be very clearly the opinion of leading French text-writers. In 20 Laurent, no. 534, we read:\nLa loi donne l\u2019action pour lie dommage caus\u00e9, donc \u00e0 tous ceux qui sont (l\u00e9s\u00e9s par le fait dommageable. Ce principe r\u00e9sulte de la g\u00e9n\u00e9ralit\u00e9 des termes de l\u2019article 1382; il est consacr\u00e9 par la jurisprudence. La cour de cassation Ta formul\u00e9 dans les termes suivants, \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de la mort instantan\u00e9e d\u2019une personne par suite d\u2019un accident de chemin de fer: \"Le fait dommageable ouvre une action en dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats au profit de toute personne qui a souffert un pr\u00e9judice direct r\u00e9sultant de ce fait\u201d (Rejet, 21 juillet 1869., D. 72, 5, 386, n. 1.)\nHuc thus states the same principle in vol. 8, at no. 420:\nSelon la formule die la cour de cessation: \u201cLe fait dommageable ouvre une action en dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats au profit de toute personne qui a souffert un pr\u00e9judice direct r\u00e9sultant de ce fait\u201d (Cass. 21 juillet 1869, D. 72, 5, 386, n. 1), qu\u2019elle soit ou non h\u00e9riti\u00e8re de la victime. (Alger, 23 mai 1892, S. 94, 2, 62.)\nIn 2 Planiol, 9e \u00e9d., at no. 890, we read:\nQuand la faute est dommageable, elle produit \u00e0 la charge de son auteur une obligation d\u2019indemniser la victime. Cette obligation de payer des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats est, en mati\u00e8re civile, la sanction n\u00e9cessaire de toutes les obligations l\u00e9gales, aussi bien que de toutes les obligations conventionnelles. La faute est donc un fait productif d\u2019une obligation nouvelle.\nand, at no. 892:\nToute personne l\u00e9s\u00e9e par la faute a le droit d\u2019\u00eatre indemnis\u00e9e. Il doit donc y avoir en principe autant d\u2019indemnit\u00e9s distinctes qu\u2019il y a de personnes l\u00e9s\u00e9es: toutefois, cela n\u2019est pas toujours n\u00e9cessaire.\nSee also, 1 Sourdat, Responsabilit\u00e9, nos. 103, 659, 690, 691, 692.\nCommenting on articles 1382 and 1383 C.N., Larombi\u00e8re, in his Treatise on Obligations (1857), vol. V, at no. 36 (p. 713), says:\nQuant au droit qui appartient \u00e0 la partie l\u00e9s\u00e9e, de poursuivre la r\u00e9paration du dommage qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9, l\u2019action qui en r\u00e9sulte existe \u00e9galement en sa faveur, soit que le d\u00e9lit ou quasi-d\u00e9lit lui ait fait \u00e9prouver un dommage mat\u00e9riel ou un tort moral, d\u2019une mani\u00e8re directe ou indirecte. Mais elle doit, dans tous les cas, commencer par \u00e9tablir que ce dommage existe, et qu\u2019il existe par la faute de l\u2019auteur du fait.\nLorsqu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 directement et individuellement atteinte dans sa fortune, sa personne, sa consid\u00e9ration et son honneur, la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 du pr\u00e9judice est plus manifestement sensible et plus ais\u00e9ment appr\u00e9ciable. Mais il n\u2019en est plus moins vrai qu\u2019elle peut \u00eatre indirectement l\u00e9s\u00e9e dans les biens, dans la personne d\u2019un tiers, et \u00e9prouver le contrecoup des atteintes port\u00e9es aux droits de ce dernier. Il suffit alors que le d\u00e9lit ou quasi-d\u00e9lit ait \u00e9t\u00e9 la cause d\u2019un dommage quelconque \u00e0 son \u00e9gard, sans qu\u2019elle s\u2019y soit elle-m\u00eame volontairement et imprudemment expos\u00e9e, pour qu\u2019elle ait une action personnelle en r\u00e9paration.\nSee also no. 27 and Domat\u2019s \u0152uvres Compl\u00e8tes (1830), vol. I, p. 480, no. 1; p. 483, no. 10.\nAs to what is \u201cindirect\u201d damage not recoverable, see 43 Rev. Crit. de Leg. (1914), pp. 229 et seq. and S. 1911, 1, 545. It is damage of which the fault (fait) of the defendant has been merely the occasion, not the cause. The jurisprudence fully supports the views thus expressed by \u201cthe authors,\u201d and is by no means wholly modern. To quote a few reports of decisions, selected from many: In Ragon v. Chanfrault[35], we read:\nL\u2019action civile en r\u00e9paration d\u2019un crime ou d\u00e9lit appartient \u00e0 tous ceux qui, directement ou indirectement, en ont souffert un pr\u00e9judice r\u00e9el; il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire pour que leur action soit recevable, que des obligations naturelles et l\u00e9gales les rattachent \u00e0 la victime.\nNos. 441-2, Pandectes Belges (1889), vol. 32, vbo. Domm.-Ints., read as follows:\n441. La loi donne l\u2019action en dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e0 tous ceux qui sont l\u00e9s\u00e9s par le fait dommageable. Ce principe r\u00e9sulte des termes m\u00eames de l\u2019art. 1382, et il a \u00e9t\u00e9 consacr\u00e9 par la jurisprudence.\n442. Un int\u00e9r\u00eat quelconque ne suffit pas, toutefois: il faut que le dommage soit personnel \u00e0 la personne qui se pr\u00e9tend l\u00e9s\u00e9e, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire il faut qu\u2019elle soit atteinte dans des droits ou des int\u00e9r\u00eats individuels.\nIn no, 1010, Sirey, Codes Ann. (Civ.), vol. 3, arts. 1382-3, we find:\nD\u00e9cid\u00e9, dans le m\u00eame sens, que s\u2019il ne suffit pas pour autoriser une action civile en dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats qu\u2019il soit justifi\u00e9 d\u2019un lien de parent\u00e9 ou d\u2019affection entre la victime d\u2019un crime ou d\u2019un d\u00e9lit et ceux qui r\u00e9clament r\u00e9paration, il n\u2019est pas non plus n\u00e9cessaire que des obligations naturelles et l\u00e9gales les rattachent l\u2019un \u00e0 l\u2019autre; il suffit qu\u2019il y ait pr\u00e9judice r\u00e9el pour donner droit \u00e0 r\u00e9paration. * * * (Bourges, 16 d\u00e9c. 1872, S. 74, 2, 71.)\nIn S. 1894. 2. 22, we have a decision of the Court of Appeal at Lyons indicating that it is of slight importance in the case of a claim by a brother or sister that there did not exist on the part of the injured person any alimentary obligation towards the plaintiffs.\nAgain, in Pandectes Belges, 1881, vol. 5, vbo., Act. Civ., at no. 51, we read:\nBien que le dommage \u00e9prouv\u00e9 doive \u00eatre personnel au demandeur, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que l\u2019infraction ait \u00e9t\u00e9 dirig\u00e9e contre lui-m\u00eame; il suffit que, en frappant directement d\u2019autres personnes, elle ait port\u00e9 en m\u00eame temps atteinte \u00e0 son honneur ou \u00e0 sa fortune.\nSee Chemins de fer de l\u2019Est c. Lucioni[36]. Demolombe says (vol. 31 (1882), par. 675), at p. 579:\nUne seule question se pose: ce demandeur, en responsabilit\u00e9 civile, a-t-il \u00e9prouv\u00e9 un dommage r\u00e9sultant du d\u00e9lit ou du quasi-d\u00e9lit, imputable au d\u00e9fendeur? Si l\u2019on r\u00e9pond affirmativement, cela suffit; or, l\u2019assooi\u00e9 priv\u00e9 de son associ\u00e9, le chef peut-\u00eatre et l\u2019\u00e2me de l\u2019entreprise commune, peut avoir \u00e9prouv\u00e9 un dommage consid\u00e9rable; donc, il a droit \u00e0 une r\u00e9paration.\nFinally, from Fuzier-Herman, III Cod. Civ. Ann., arts. 1382-3, nos. 686 et seq., I take the following summary: 686. L\u2019action en dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats appartient \u00e0 toute personne qui, soit directement, soit indirectement, \u00e9prouve un pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 raison du d\u00e9lit ou du quasi-d\u00e9lit connais par le d\u00e9fendeur Aubry et Rau, t. 4, p. 74$; n\u00b0 445; Reuter, Cours de l\u00e9gisl. crim., t. 2, p. 444; Huc, t. 8 n\u00b0 420; Laurent, t. 20, n\u00b0 534; Larombi\u00e8re, sur les arts, 1382-3, n\u00b0 36; Demolombe, t. 31, nos 673 et seq.\n686 bis. Comme l\u2019action en dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats appartient \u00e0 ceux qui indirectement \u00e9prouvent un pr\u00e9judice, il faut admettre que la compagnie d\u2019assurances qui, \u00e0 la suite de meurtre d\u2019un assur\u00e9, a d\u00fb verser \u00e0 ses h\u00e9ritiers le montant de l\u2019assurance stipul\u00e9e en cas de d\u00e9c\u00e8s, est en droit de r\u00e9clamer des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e0 l\u2019assassin, \u00e0 raison du pr\u00e9judice que lui a fait \u00e9prouver le paiement pr\u00e9matur\u00e9 de l\u2019assurance.

But, apparently, all that it is required to prove, under art. 1053 C.C., is that, as the result of an interference with that relation attributable in law to fault of the defendant, it has sustained damage, which it becomes the duty of the jury (or of the judge discharging its functions) to assess. I find it impossible to distinguish in principle from the case at bar that of Cedar Shingles Co. v. Comp. d\u2019Ass. de Rimouski[37], cited by Greenshields, J., where, not as the result of any subrogation, but solely because it was held to be directly within art. 1053 C.C., the loss sustained by a fire insurance company, obliged by contract to indemnify the owner of the property destroyed, was held to give it a right of action against the defendant, a third party, who was responsible for the fire.\nL\u2019assureur qui a pay\u00e9 le montant de l\u2019assurance \u00e0 l\u2019assur\u00e9, a, pour se faire rembourser, contre l\u2019auteur du sinistre, le recours en dommages de l\u2019art. 1053 C.C.\nSo reads the fifth paragraph of the head-note to the report of that case.\nBoss\u00e9, J., delivering the judgment of the court, after stating that the claim of the plaintiff was based on art. 1053 C.C., and depended upon the soundness of its contention that, having been obliged to pay because of the fault of the defendant, the latter was bound to reimburse it, said, at p. 382:\nCette doctrine a \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9e par (Pardessus, vol. 2, n\u00b0 595, cit\u00e9 par les codificateurs sous l\u2019art. 2584, et Pardessus rapporte, dans ce sens, un arr\u00eat de la cour de cassation du 18 d\u00e9cembre 1827, D. 28, 1, 63. Depuis lors, Ruben de Couder, n\u00b0 252, 252 (sic) et DuHail, n\u00b0 176, cit\u00e9s par Dalloz, ont adopt\u00e9 cette opinion, et elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 sanctionn\u00e9e par la cour de cassation dans l\u2019affaire de La Prudence, D. 53, 1, 93, et par la cour d\u2019Appel de Chamb\u00e9ry, dans l\u2019affaire de la Compagnie L\u2019Europe, D. 82, 2, 238.\nSee, also, Alauzet, \u201cAssurances,\u201d vol. 2, pp. 388-9.\nThis decision of the Quebec court finds full support in French and Belgian jurisprudence of long standing. In D. 1882. 2. 238, mentioned by Boss\u00e9, J., the following notable paragraph occurs in the report of Compagnie L\u2019Europe c. Gruffart et al.\nAttendu, en effet, que les dispositions des arts. 1382 et 1383 sont aussi g\u00e9n\u00e9rales dans leurs termes qu\u2019\u00e9tendues dans leur application; qu\u2019elles ne font aucune distinction ni aucune r\u00e9serve et constituent en quelque sorte un droit commun, applicable \u00e0 tous les citoyens, quelles que soient leur situation, ou leurs entreprises particuli\u00e8res:\u2014Que, d\u00e8s lors, il n\u2019y a aucune raison d\u2019exclure une compagnie d\u2019assurances de ce droit commun et de la cantonner exclusivement dans ses droits respectifs avec ses assur\u00e9s, en l\u2019excluant des droits et actions qui peuvent lui comp\u00e9ter personnellement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des tiers.\nSee, also, D. 1853. 1. 93; D. 1859. 1. 429; D. 1872. 1. 293; D.

It has been suggested that the fact that such insurance is not by way of indemnity distinguishes it from fire insurance and takes the case out of the operation of arts. 1382-3 C.N. See L\u2019Abeille c. May,[38]; Juris-Classeur Civ., arts. 1382-3, D\u00e9lits et quasi-d\u00e9lits, Div. Al, no. 138; Phoenix Assur. Co. c. Chemin de fer du Midi[39]; S. 1903. 2. 257n., 259; S. 1911. 2. 171; Gaz. des Trib., 1913. 1. 182. Compare Merchants\u2019 and Employers\u2019 Guarantee & Accident Co. v. Blanchard (Rev.)[40]; Merchants\u2019 and Employers\u2019 Guarantee & Accident Co. v. Brunet (Rev.)[41]; Lloyd\u2019s Plate Glass Ins. Co. v. Pacaud[42]; Animals\u2019 Insurance Co. v. Montreal Tramways Co. (Rev.)[43]; and Motor Union Ins. Co. v. Sacks et al[44]. Recovery by life or accident insurance companies against third parties, who, by their fault, have injured the assured, thus entailing liability on such companies, is made in modern cases to depend on the presence in the contracts of insurance of a clause which can be treated as a cession by the assured to the company of his ultimate rights. See La Mutuelle G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Fran\u00e7aise c. Antoniotti[45]. Whether there is a sufficient logical basis for this distinction (Lefort, \u201cL\u2019Assurance sur La Vie, vol. 2, pp. 5-20) does not presently concern us; and it may be that the view expressed by Martineau, J., against recovery under art. 1053 C.C., was, in the Blanchard case40, correct in principle, although his deductions from the judgment of the Privy Council, delivered by Baron Parke, in Quebec Fire Insurance Co. v. Molson[46], seem quite unwarranted. But the right of a fire insurance company to recover under article 1053 C.C. from a third party whose fault occasioned the loss for which, under its contract, it has been obliged to indemnify its assured, seems to be well recognized in the jurisprudence of the province of Quebec. Stemus decisis. In principle there can be no distinction for the purpose of art. 1053 C.C. between the position, quoad the third party tort-feasor, of the fire insurance company and that of the master whose loss is caused by the defendant having tortiously injured his servant, or that of a religious community similarly damnified by an injury inflicted upon one of its members. In each case alike, the plaintiff must shew (a) fault of the defendant; (b) that such fault was in law the cause of the damage for which it seeks to recover; and (c) that such damage was actually suffered by it.\nThe existence of the relation between the respondent and Brother Henri-Gabriel is in no sense the equivalent of a novus actus interveneins such as would break the causal connection between the appellant\u2019s fault and the injury sustained by the respondent from it. That relation was, at the most, a causa sine qua non, or condition of the defendant having damnified the respondent. It was the occasion, not the cause of its being injured. 43 Rev. Crit. de L\u00e9g. (1914), pp. 230-1.\nMoreover, while in cases of responsibility for breach of contract the degree of fault, and foreknowledge of the probability of its affecting the plaintiff adversely, intent and even motive may be material (Art. 1074 C.C. et seq.), comparative slightness of the fault shewn affords no answer even in mitigation of damages, nor can the absence of foreknowledge, intent or motive be invoked to support a defence based on remoteness of damage in cases of quasi-d\u00e9lit entirely independent of any breach of contract by the defendant; Ortenberg\u2019s case (infra) affords an illustration. See also Loranger v. Dominion Transport Co.[47]; Leclerc v. Montreal[48]. As the slightest degree of fault or negligence (culpa levissima) (S. 1927. 1. 201; S. 1924. 1. 105) suffices to entail liability in cases of quasi-d\u00e9lit, so the damage must, as far as practicable, be assessed in such cases under the civil law at a figure adequate to give complete compensation to the injured plaintiff. Juris-Class. Civ., art. 1382-3, D\u00e9lits et quasi-d\u00e9lits, Div. A 1, nos. 2, 8.\nThe presence in the Civil Code of arts. 1074-5, which impose explicit limitations on the measure of damages recoverable for breach of contract, sharply contrasts with the utter absence of any such textual restriction in cases where d\u00e9lits or quasi-d\u00e9lits form the basis of action under art. 1053 C.C. In cases of contractual obligation the presumed intention of the parties affords the basis for restricting or extending the damages to what they may reasonably be supposed to have contemplated. See Jackson v. Watson[49]; and Griffiths v. Harwood[50]. In the ordinary case of a d\u00e9lit or quasi-d\u00e9lit causing damage, there is no such ground for thus confining or restricting the recovery against the wrong-doer. There can, therefore, be no justification for the application by analogy of restrictions, similar to those imposed by articles 1074-5 C.C., to cases of d\u00e9lits or quasi-d\u00e9lits. The very suggestion seems to me heretical. But see 1 Sourdat, Responsabilit\u00e9, nos. 105, 107. In 5 Larambi\u00e8re (1357), arts. 1382-3, nos. 26 and 37, we read:\nLes dommages et int\u00e9r\u00eats dus pour la r\u00e9paration d\u2019un d\u00e9lit ou d\u2019un quasi-d\u00e9lit ne doivent n\u00e9anmoins comprendre, pour la perte \u00e9prouv\u00e9e ou le gain manqu\u00e9, que ce qui en est une suite imm\u00e9diate et directe. Mais, comme il n\u2019est intervenu aucune convention, ils ne doivent pas \u00eatre limit\u00e9s \u00e0 ce que l\u2019auteur du fait a pu pr\u00e9voir au moment o\u00f9 il l\u2019a commis, alors m\u00eame qu\u2019il n\u2019y aurait pas eu de sa part dol, malice et dessein de nuire.\nLa responsabilit\u00e9 civile comprend l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9parer totalement le dommage caus\u00e9. * * *\nIl est indiff\u00e9rent au point de vue du droit civil (says Zachari\u00e6 (Mass\u00e9 et Verg\u00e9, vol. 4, p. 16)) que le dommage ait \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 sciemment ou par n\u00e9gligence: la n\u00e9gligence la plus l\u00e9g\u00e8re suffit pour motiver une action en dommages et int\u00e9r\u00eats, arg. art. 1388. (See also foot-note n\u00b0 4, ibid.).\nThis is well pointed out in Juris-Classeur Civil, arts. 1382-3, div. A, nos. 3 and 4.\nPerhaps the best known, if not the only kind of tort in respect of which lack of foreknowledge of the interest of the plaintiff, actual or reasonably possible, may be invoked as a defence is that of inducing a person to act in contravention of the contractual rights of another. Quinn v. Leatham[51]. A., who, in ignorance of the obligations of a servant to B., induces him (the servant) to undertake a service inconsistent therewith, merely exercises his own right and commits no fault. Therefore the case is not within article 1053 C.C. But intent to defeat the rights of the former employer, importing malice, may render such conduct actionable. Girard v. Wayagamack Pulp & Paper Co.[52]. Compare Pruneau v. Fortin[53], a case where the defendant exercised his legal right, not in order to injure the plaintiff, but to advance what he conceived to be his own interest. English law admits this departure from the usual rule, that where there is question of actionable responsibility for tort (d\u00e9lit or quasi-d\u00e9lit) the motive and intent of the tort-feasor are immaterial. An act which does not amount to a legal injury cannot be actionable because done with bad intent. Allen v. Flood[54].\nAn interesting observation upon the juridical basis of the two notable decisions of the House of Lords above cited, from the point of view of the civilian, may be found in G\u00e9rard\u2019s work \u201cLes Torts ou D\u00e9lits Civils en Droit Anglais,\u201d at pp. 426 et seq. Most of the discussion in the French cases (S. 1925. 1. 249) and in the works of the French text-writers, however, bears upon the much-debated question whether, when the victim of an accident caused by the defendant\u2019s fault has a claim against him for breach of contract, he may, either concurrently or alternatively, prefer a claim based on quasi-d\u00e9lit under arts. 1382-3 C.N. See Robillard v. Wand[55]. There is, of course, no such aspect of the case at bar. That is common ground.\nAnother case illustrative of the wide scope of art. 1053 C.C. is Ortenberg v. Plamondon[56], where, at p. 388, Mr. Justice Cross, holding the defendant liable to the plaintiff for damages for slander in the course of a public lecture, although it would seem certain that reference to the plaintiff had not been intended by the lecturer, said:\nThe respondent pleaded that the statements made in his lecture were true, but he has failed to prove the ground of defence. He is in the position of having maliciously caused damage to the appellant. It is merely a case of applying the article 1053 C.C.\nThe plaintiff\u2019s right of action to recover on its claim for $118 for loss of its own property, which Brother Gabriel had with him when injured, admits of no question. Although this item is not specifically mentioned in the judgment, it was probably taken into account by the learned trial judge in fixing the damages at $4,000. The plaintiff\u2019s recovery of the portion of its claim for out-of-pocket expenses ($2,236.90), as fixed by the trial judge, can be supported, in the opinion of the majority of the learned judges of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, upon another and distinct basis, suggested by Mr. Justice Greenshields, viz., that the negligence of the defendant being proved to have been the cause of the injuries of Brother Henri-Gabriel, it incurred an obligation to furnish to him all care necessary to alleviate his sufferings, and, as far as possible, to bring about his recovery, or at least to pay for such care.\nPayment may be made by any person, although he may be a stranger to the obligation (Art. 1:141 C.C.).\nHe whose business has been well managed is bound to fulfil the obligations that the person acting for him has contracted in his name, to indemnify him for all the personal liabilities which he has assured, and to reimburse him for all necessary or useful expenses. (Article 1046 C.C.)\nThe expenses incurred by the plaintiff for doctor\u2019s bills, and hospital care, etc., for Brother Henri-Gabriel may well be regarded as outlay made by it in the discharge of an obligation of the defendant and for its benefit. On similar grounds, in Paquin v. Grand Trunk Rly. Co. (1896)[57], cited by Greenshields, J., the defendant railway company was held liable to the plaintiff, who had rendered medical services to persons injured in an accident caused by its negligence, although such services had not been requested or sanctioned by anyone authorized on its behalf. Reference may also be made to the authorities cited by Larue, J., at p. 338; and to La Cit\u00e9 de St. Hyacinthe v. Brault[58]. Subject to the question of the application of art. 2262 (2) C.C., the right of the plaintiff to maintain an action on the basis de in rem verso for the sum of $2,236.90 would seem to be reasonably clear.\nAs to the amount of the total damages, assessed at $4,000, even if the practice of this court permitted a revision thereof, I agree with Mr. Justice Cannon that\nLa privation des services du Fr\u00e8re Gabriel a certainement caus\u00e9 des dommages et des embarras \u00e0 la communaut\u00e9 dont il faisait partie,\nand with Mr. Justice Bernier that the amount allowed for actual damages beyond the out-of-pocket expenses, viz., $1,767.10, was \u201cnot exorbitant\u2014bien loin de l\u00e0.\u201d Reference may again be made to 5 Larombi\u00e8re, Obligations, 1857, arts. 1382-3, no. 26 (p. 704) quoted above; to Fuz.-Herman, III Code Civ. Ann. Arts. 1382-3, nos. 699, 688; and to Juris-Class. Civ., Arts. 1382-3, D\u00e9lits et quasi-d\u00e9lits, Div. A. 1; nos. 2 and 8.\nThe accident to Brother Henri-Gabriel happened on the 14th of August, 1923. The present action was begun on the 8th of August, 1925. More than one year and less than two years had elapsed in the interval.\nThe defendant, claiming that this is an action \u201cfor bodily injuries\u201d within art. 2262 (2) C.C. above quoted, asserts that it is prescribed. The plaintiff, on the other hand, argues that the action falls within art. 2261 (2), by which actions\nfor damages resulting from offences or quasi-offences, whenever other provisions do not apply * * * are prescribed by two years,\nand contends that the action was begun in time and is not prescribed.\nThese provisions of the Civil Code are found in section 5 of chapter 6, of Tit. XIX, that section being headed, \u201cOf certain short prescriptions.\u201d\nIn the province of Quebec, as in France, the general rule is that\nall things, Tights and actions, the prescription of which is not otherwise regulated by law, are prescribed by thirty years. (Art. 2242 C.C.; Cf. Art. 2262 C.N.)\nThese short prescriptions are exceptions to this general rule and, as is pointed out in 32 Laurent, at no. 373, they are subject to the principles which govern all exceptions: \u201con ne peut pas les \u00e9tendre, m\u00eame par voie d\u2019analogie.\u201d Baudry-Lacantinerie Droit Civil (De la prescription), vol. 28 no. 24, citing Cass. 26 juin 1859, S. 59. 1. 858), says:\nAinsi que l\u2019a jug\u00e9 la cour de cassation: les lois qui \u00e9tablissent des prescriptions ou des d\u00e9ch\u00e9ances sont de droit \u00e9troit et ne peuvent pas \u00eatre \u00e9tendues par analogie d\u2019un cas \u00e0 un autre.\nAn illustration of the application of this rule is to be found in 32 Laurent, no. 377, where it is pointed out that, although \u201cla loi sur l\u2019imp\u00f4t fonder de 3 frimaire, an VII (Art. 149)\u201d establishes a special prescription of three years in favour of contributaries, that prescription does not apply to a third person who has paid the impost for the debtor, and the author gives as a reason that the action is entirely different:\nle tiers qui paye pour le contribuable a l\u2019action de mandat, de gestion d\u2019affaires, ou au moins l\u2019action de in rem verso. Cette action n\u2019a rien de commun avec la loi de l\u2019an VII: c\u2019est une action ordinaire qui se prescrit d\u2019apr\u00e8s le droit commun par trente ans. And he makes reference to a decision of the Court of Cassation of 15th March, 1841, reported in Dalloz, Rep., vbo. Prescription, no. 1046 1\u00b0 and to Pasicrisie (1829), p. 342. The author proceeds:\nIl en est de m\u00eame die toutes les autres prescriptions: on doit les limiter strictement aux cas pour lesquels elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablies: en dehors de ces cas, elles n\u2019ont plus de raison d\u2019\u00eatre. Les int\u00e9r\u00eats se prescrivent par cinq ans entre le cr\u00e9ancier et le d\u00e9biteur; si un tiers avance les deniers, il aura une action ordinaire de trente ans, parce que, \u00e0 son \u00e9gard, il n\u2019y a pas une dette d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats, il y a une dette ordinaire.\nIn volume IX of Mr. Justice Mignault\u2019s work \u201cDroit Civil Canadien,\u201d at p. 518, we find the statement:\nla prescription courte est une prescription d\u2019exception; elle n\u2019existe que lorsqu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 expressement d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9e par le l\u00e9gislateur.\nThat the limitation of one year imposed by art. 2262 (2) C.C. applies to all actions by a person who has sustained bodily injury to recover damages therefor, or for the consequences thereof, and that such prescriptive period runs from the date when the injury was suffered admits of no doubt in view of the decision of this court in City of Montreal v. McGee[59]; by which the decision in Caron v. Abbott[60], cited by Dorion J., was impliedly overruled. See Versailles v. Dominion Cotton Co.[61].\nBut an action brought, as is that now before us, not by the person who has suffered bodily harm, but by someone else who has sustained damages distinct from his by reason of the fault of the defendant, although such damages be a consequence of the bodily injuries, is certainly not the same action which the person so injured might himself have brought. For instance, in it the plaintiff can recover nothing for the pain and suffering which the injuries caused to the victim, but is strictly limited to such damages as he can prove he has himself actually sustained. The cause of action before us is not \u201cfor (the) bodily injuries\u201d suffered by Brother Henri-Gabriel as the immediate result of the fault, by him \u201cactionable per se;\u201d it is rather for the loss sustained by the community owing to the expense to which it was put and to its having been deprived of the services of one of its members through the fault of the defendant; per quod only is such fault actionable by it. Robert Mary\u2019s case[62]. Its cause of action for damages other than out-of-pocket expenses would have been the same had the defendant illegally detained Brother Henri-Gabriel for the period in question, or had it wrongfully induced him to absent himself from the community. In each case alike the plaintiff would claim for \u201cdamages caused (to it) by (the) fault\u201d of the defendant (Art. 1053 C.C.), or by that of \u201cpersons under its control\u201d (Art. 1054 C.C.).\nThis leads us to a brief consideration of the precise terms in which art. 2262 (2) C.C. is couched. In the first place, the words \u201cfor bodily injuries\u201d of the English version are very inaptly rendered in the French version by the words \u201cpour injures corporelles,\u201d the meaning of the latter as intended, no doubt, being \u201cpour l\u00e9sions ou blessures corporelles.\u201d While not of present importance, it is, perhaps, not out of place here to suggest legislative action in regard to the French versions of articles 2262 (2) C.C. and of article 1056 C.C. above referred to. What, however, is of moment at present is the contrast between the language of art. 2261 (2) C.C. \u201cfor damages resulting from offences or quasi-offences\u201d (\u201cpour dommages r\u00e9sultant de d\u00e9lits et quasi-d\u00e9lits\u201d) and the terms of art. 2262 (2) \u201cfor bodily injuries.\u201d The latter paragraph is grouped with no. (1) \u201cfor slander or libel\u201d (\u201cpour injures verbales ou \u00e9crites\u201d) and no. (3) \u201cfor wages of domestic or farm servants\u201d (\u201cpour gages des domestiques de maison ou de ferme\u201d) and no. (4) \u201cfor hotel or boarding-house charges\u201d (\u201cpour d\u00e9penses d\u2019hotellerie ou de pension\u201d). This context seems to make the contrast between art. 2262 (2) and art. 2261 (2) even more significant, the words \u201cdamages resulting from\u201d being introduced into the latter (art. 2261 (2)) although other provisions of the same article, nos. (1) and (3), read: (1) \u201cfor seduction and lying-in expenses\u201d (\u201cpour s\u00e9duction et frais de g\u00e9sine\u201d) and (3) \u201cfor wages of workmen, etc.\u201d (pour salaires des employ\u00e9s, etc.\u201d). There can be no justification in my opinion for reading art. 2262 (2) C.C. as if its terms were \u201cfor damages resulting from bodily injuries.\u201d To do so would involve a distinct extension of its application. In introducing into the Code art. 2262 (2) C.C. (See Codifiers\u2019 4th Report, p. 194, no. 103a), the legislature probably had in mind only the right of action of the person suffering such injuries (\u201cthe immediate victim\u201d), who alone can sue to recover for them. Had it intended to cover by the very short prescription of one year, which art. 2262 (2) C.C. enacts, all actions for \u201cdamages resulting from, or arising out of\u201d bodily injuries, having before it the language of art. 2261 (2) C.C., it is scarcely possible that terms similar to those therein employed would not have been used. The statement of Lacoste, C.J., in Griffith v. Harwood[63],\nArticle 2202 * * * rend prescriptible par un an tout dommage r\u00e9sultant de l\u00e9sions corporelles.\nis obiter, and is, no doubt inadvertently, too broad\u2014in fact distinctly broader than the authority cited justifies, viz., Canadian Pacific Ry. Co. v. Robinson[64]. There the question was as to the effect of art. 2262 (2) C.C. on the right of recovery of \u201cthe immediate victim,\u201d as it was in the later case of City of Montreal v. McGee[65],\nThe plaintiff does not seek to affect the defendant by its understanding with Brother Henri-Gabriel. It complains that the defendant has unlawfully deprived it of the benefit which it would otherwise have derived from its arrangement with its member and, for the damage thus done to it, it seeks compensation. Compare S. 1925. 1. 249n, refusing to apply art. 433 C. Comm., limiting actions by railway passengers, to an action brought by a mother for the death of her son, who was killed while a passenger.\nI agree with the following consid\u00e9rant of Mr. Justice Surveyer:\nConsid\u00e9rant cependant que la demanderesse ne poursuit pas pour le fr\u00e8re Henri-Gabriel et en son lieu et place, mais qu\u2019elle r\u00e9clame un droit qui lui est personnel, et qui est distinct de celui qu\u2019avait le fr\u00e8re Henri-Gabriel; que ce droit ne r\u00e9sulte pas des injures corporelles subies par ce dernier, mais des d\u00e9penses auxquelles la demanderesse a \u00e9t\u00e9 contrainte et des dommages qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9s par la privation des services du dit fr\u00e8re Henri-Gabriel.\nThe prescription of one year imposed by art. 2262 (2) C.C. could only apply by analogy, or by implication from its mention of art. 1056 C.C. For such a case as that now before us this prescription has not been \u201cexpress\u00e9ment d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9e par la l\u00e9gislature.\u201d A fortiori is this so in so far as the claim for out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the plaintiff on account of Brother Henri-Gabriel\u2019s injuries is concerned, if that claim be regarded, not as based on art. 1053 C.C., but as resting on art. 1046 C.C.; whether, if the action be regarded as de in rem verso, the prescription of art. 2262 (2) C.C. applies, I find it unnecessary to determine. My learned brothers Mignault and Rinfret think it does; and from their considered opinion on this point I am not at present prepared to dissent. But see 32 Laurent, no. 377 (supra). Of course, to the claim for destruction of clothing and personal effects, the property of the plaintiffs, art. 2262 (2) C.C. can have no application. As to this latter item of the plaintiff\u2019s demand, it is, in my opinion, beyond question that art. 2261 (2) C.C. applies. Indeed, I am of the opinion not only that the entire cause of action, so far as it rests on arts. 1053-4 C.C., is maintainable, but that it falls within art. 2261 (2) C.C. rather than within art. 2262 (2) C.C.\nI, accordingly, accept the following consid\u00e9rants of Mr. Justice Surveyer:\nConsid\u00e9rant que l\u2019action qui comp\u00e9tait au fr\u00e8re Henri-Gabriel \u00e9tait une action pour injures corporelles (bodily injuries), prescriptibles par un an (C.C., art. 2262, par. 2);\nConsid\u00e9rant, cependant, que la demanderesse ne poursuit pas pour le fr\u00e8re Henri-Gabriell et en son lieu et place, mais qu\u2019elle r\u00e9clame un droit qui lui est personnel, et qui est distinct de celui qu\u2019avait le fr\u00e8re Henri-Gabriel; que ce droit ne r\u00e9sulte pas des injures corporelles subies par ce dernier, mais des d\u00e9penses auxquelles la demanderesse a \u00e9t\u00e9 contrainte et des dommages qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9s par la privation des services dudit fr\u00e8re Henri-Gabriel;\nConsid\u00e9rant que la demanderesse cherche la r\u00e9paration civile d\u2019un quasi-d\u00e9lit qui lui cause un pr\u00e9judice r\u00e9el et lui fait \u00e9prouver un dommage positif et mat\u00e9riel;\nConsid\u00e9rant que l\u2019accident arriv\u00e9 au fr\u00e8re Henri-Gabriel s\u2019est produit le 14 ao\u00fbt 1923, et que la demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9e le 8 ao\u00fbt 1925, par cons\u00e9quent dans les deux ans du quasi-d\u00e9lit (C.C. art. 2261).\nFor the foregoing reasons, which are substantially the same as those of the learned trial judge and of Green-shields, J., I would affirm the judgment a quo and would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nMignault, J. (dissenting).\u2014L\u2019appel est d\u2019un jugement de la cour du Banc du Roi[66], confirmant \u00e0 l\u2019unanimit\u00e9 le jugement de la cour sup\u00e9rieure, Surveyer, J. Il n\u2019y a eu diff\u00e9rence d\u2019opinion que quant au montant de la condamnation. La compagnie appelante exploite des automobiles de louage (taxis) ainsi que des autobus, pour le transport des voyageurs, surtout dans la r\u00e9gion de Montr\u00e9al. Elle existe en vertu de lettres patentes de la province de Qu\u00e9bec.\nLa congr\u00e9gation intim\u00e9e est une congr\u00e9gation religieuse d\u2019hommes, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 constitu\u00e9e civilement par une loi de la province de Qu\u00e9bec de 1887, 50 Vict., c. 29. Cette loi lui permet de s\u2019agr\u00e9ger des membres, et d\u2019adopter des r\u00e8glements non incompatibles aux lois de cette province. Elle a plusieurs maisons dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec o\u00f9 elle se voue \u00e0 l\u2019enseignement. Ses membres prononcent des v\u0153ux perp\u00e9tuels de pauvret\u00e9, de chastet\u00e9 et d\u2019ob\u00e9issance, mais il n\u2019est pas question de ces v\u0153ux dans la loi constitutive de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Les fr\u00e8res maristes ont des maisons ailleurs que dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, et notamment \u00e0 New-York. L\u2019Acte 50 Vict., c. 29, se borne naturellement aux \u00e9tablissements que les fr\u00e8res maristes ont faits ou feront en cette province.\nLe fr\u00e8re Henri-Gabriel, dont il sera question plus loin, \u00e9tait membre de cette congr\u00e9gation lors de l\u2019accident qui a donn\u00e9 lieu au proc\u00e8s, et il enseignait \u00e0 la maison des fr\u00e8res maristes \u00e0 Iberville, province de Qu\u00e9bec. Il avait prononc\u00e9 des v\u0153ux perp\u00e9tuels, et aussi ce qu\u2019on appelle des v\u0153ux de stabilit\u00e9, dont l\u2019objet est d\u2019obliger le religieux (en conscience, bien entendu) \u00e0 demeurer membre de la congr\u00e9gation pendant toute sa vie.\nAu mois d\u2019ao\u00fbt 1923, les fr\u00e8res maristes \u00e9tablis \u00e0 New-York, et qui ne font pas partie de la corporation \u00e9tablie par la loi 50 Vict., c. 29 (il n\u2019appert pas s\u2019ils ont obtenu une constitution civile de l\u2019Etat de New-York), avaient un campement d\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 pour leurs \u00e9l\u00e8ves sur l\u2019\u00eele Lamothe, dans l\u2019Etat du Vermont, pr\u00e8s de Rouses Point, New-York, et \u00e0 une cinquantaine de milles de Montr\u00e9al. Ils avaient organis\u00e9 une excursion pour les enfants de leur camp jusqu\u2019\u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, et avaient contract\u00e9 avec la compagnie appelante pour transporter les enfants et les fr\u00e8res qui les accompagnaient \u00e0 travers cette derni\u00e8re ville, et de l\u00e0 \u00e0 Rouses Point. L\u2019appelante leur fournit deux autobus avec chauffeurs, contenant chacun une vingtaine de personnes. Le contrat de transport n\u2019\u00e9tait donc pas entre l\u2019intim\u00e9e et l\u2019appelante, mais entre cette derni\u00e8re et des fr\u00e8res maristes qui ne faisaient pas partie de la corporation intim\u00e9e. Il s\u2019ensuit qu\u2019aucune question de responsabilit\u00e9 contractuelle ou de faute contractuelle ne peut se soulever entre l\u2019intim\u00e9e et l\u2019appelante.\nL\u2019excursion se fit le 14 ao\u00fbt 1923. L\u2019appelante avait promen\u00e9 les excursionnistes dans la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, et vers la fin de l\u2019apr\u00e8s-midi elle les ramenait dans la direction de Rouses Point. Le fr\u00e8re Henri-Gabriel \u00e9tait du voyage, probablement sur l\u2019invitation des fr\u00e8res maristes de New-York, et il prit place sur la premi\u00e8re banquette d\u2019une des voitures. Entre lui et l\u2019appelante, pas plus qu\u2019entre l\u2019intim\u00e9e et l\u2019appelante, il n\u2019y avait aucun contrat de transport.\nPendant le trajet entre Montr\u00e9al et Rouses Point, la voiture o\u00f9 se trouvait le fr\u00e8re Henri-Gabriel fit arr\u00eat \u00e0 Saint-Philippe de Laprairie pour prendre de la gazoline. Le chauffeur en demanda cinq gallons \u00e0 un garage au bord de la route. Il avait cependant mal calcul\u00e9 la quantit\u00e9 de gazoline qui pouvait entrer dans le r\u00e9servoir plac\u00e9 sous les premi\u00e8res banquettes. Il s\u2019en r\u00e9pandit donc dans la voiture, et la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un tuyau surchauff\u00e9 de la machine causa un incendie. Le fr\u00e8re Henri-Gabriel fut tr\u00e8s gri\u00e8vement br\u00fbl\u00e9, et il est hors de question que ses br\u00fblures furent caus\u00e9es par la faute du chauffeur de la voiture, faute dont l\u2019appelante \u00e9tait civilement responsable. Il avait donc une action de ce chef contre l\u2019appelante, et il me para\u00eet clair qu\u2019on n\u2019aurait pu invoquer comme fin de non-recevoir contre cette action son v\u0153u de pauvret\u00e9, ni son consentement, qui en d\u00e9coulait, que tous ses biens fussent la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la congr\u00e9gation dont il faisait partie.\nLe fr\u00e8re Henri-Gabriel ne fit jamais de r\u00e9clamation contre l\u2019appelante \u00e0 raison de l\u2019accident dont il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime. L\u2019intim\u00e9e l\u2019avait fait soigner, et elle paya tous les frais des traitements m\u00e9dicaux et chirurgicaux qu\u2019on dut lui donner. Elle en r\u00e9clame maintenant le co\u00fbt \u00e0 l\u2019appelante et elle demande en sus une indemnit\u00e9 pour privation des services du fr\u00e8re bless\u00e9, ainsi que pour les frais de son entretien alors qu\u2019il \u00e9tait dans l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 de travailler. Elle base son droit d\u2019action sur la faute d\u00e9lictuelle dont elle tient l\u2019appelante responsable. Le premier juge lui accorda $2,236.90 pour frais m\u00e9dicaux et autres d\u00e9penses, et $1,763.10 pour la privation des services du bless\u00e9. La cour du Banc du Roi[67] confirma ce jugement, mais deux des juges (Greenshields J. et Cousineau J. ad hoc) auraient restreint l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 au premier item, sauf que le juge Greenshields, apr\u00e8s une nouvelle \u00e9tude du dossier, ajoute qu\u2019il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 donner \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e $900 qu\u2019elle avait pay\u00e9s \u00e0 un rempla\u00e7ant du fr\u00e8re Henri-Gabriel.\nLa d\u00e9fense de l\u2019appelante doit maintenant nous occuper. Elle oppose deux moyens \u00e0 l\u2019action: 1o L\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas le droit d\u2019action qu\u2019elle pr\u00e9tend exercer; 2\u00b0 cette action, \u00e9tant pour \u201cinjures corporelles\u201d, est \u00e9teinte, vu qu\u2019elle n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 intent\u00e9e que le 7 ao\u00fbt 1925 et signifi\u00e9e le lendemain, pr\u00e8s de deux ans apr\u00e8s l\u2019accident (art. 2262 C.C.). Si le deuxi\u00e8me moyen est bien fond\u00e9, le premier importe peu. Cependant, il para\u00eet difficile de les s\u00e9parer, et il me semble plus avantageux de les \u00e9tudier ensemble.\nEn effet, sur cette question de prescription, tout d\u00e9pend du fondement juridique de l\u2019action. Si nous \u00e9tions en pr\u00e9sence de la violation d\u2019un contrat, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire de la faute contractuelle, je crois que l\u2019article 2262 C.C., que l\u2019appelante invoque, serait sans application. Mais j\u2019ai dit qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas eu de contrat entre les parties en litige. Le fr\u00e8re bless\u00e9 n\u2019a rien pay\u00e9 pour son passage et l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a rien d\u00e9bours\u00e9 pour son transport. Il n\u2019en est pas moins certain qu\u2019on ne peut se prononcer sur la question de prescription que lorsqu\u2019on sera fix\u00e9 sur la nature du recours que peut exercer l\u2019intim\u00e9e dans les circonstances d\u00e9voil\u00e9es par la preuve.\nD\u2019autre part, l\u2019action qui comp\u00e9tait au fr\u00e8re Henri-Gabriel\u2014la cour sup\u00e9rieure le reconna\u00eet express\u00e9ment\u2014\u00e9tait une action pour \u201cinjures corporelles\u201d prescriptible par un an. Et c\u2019est parce que le savant juge de premi\u00e8re instance \u00e9tait d\u2019avis que l\u2019action qui appartenait \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e avait une autre base juridique qu\u2019il a \u00e9cart\u00e9 le plaidoyer de prescription.\nConsid\u00e9rant (dit-il) que la demanderesse ne poursuit pas pour le fr\u00e8re Henri-Gabriel et en son lieu et place (elle n\u2019aurait pu le faire, art. 81, code de proc\u00e9dure civile), mais qu\u2019elle r\u00e9clame un droit qui lui est personnel, et qui est distinct de celui qu\u2019avait le fr\u00e8re Henri-Gabriel; que ce droit ne r\u00e9sulte pas des injures corporelles subies par ce dernier, mais des d\u00e9penses auxquelles la demanderesse a \u00e9t\u00e9 contrainte et des dommages qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9s par la privation des services dudit fr\u00e8re Henri-Gabriel. Et le savant juge ajoute, donnant \u00e0 l\u2019article 1053 C.C. une extension qu\u2019il convient de discuter \u00e0 fond, \u201cque toute personne l\u00e9s\u00e9e par une faute doit \u00eatre indemnis\u00e9e; qu\u2019il y a en principe autant d\u2019indemnit\u00e9s distinctes qu\u2019il y a de personnes l\u00e9s\u00e9es (j\u2019omets les autorit\u00e9s cit\u00e9es par le savant juge); que Demolombe (vol. 31, n\u00b0 675, p. 579) approuve un arr\u00eat qui a reconnu la r\u00e9clamation d\u2019un associ\u00e9 pour la mort de son associ\u00e9, r\u00e9clamation qui serait repouss\u00e9e par notre article 1056 C.C., qui est d\u2019origine anglaise, et qui fait exception pour les cas de d\u00e9c\u00e8s, aux principes de notre droit en mati\u00e8re de responsabilit\u00e9.\u201d\nAvant de citer nos textes de loi, je suis bien pr\u00eat \u00e0 reconna\u00eetre que la jurisprudence fran\u00e7aise moderne a donn\u00e9 aux articles 1382 et 1383 du Code Napol\u00e9on une extension absolue, et qui est bien telle que la repr\u00e9sente le savant juge. Ainsi, quoique le Code Napol\u00e9on n\u2019ait pas une disposition semblable \u00e0 notre article 1056 C.C., la jurisprudence reconna\u00eet l\u2019existence d\u2019un droit d\u2019action au profit de toute personne qui souffre un pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 cause du d\u00e9c\u00e8s d\u2019un individu qui meurt des suites d\u2019un d\u00e9lit ou quasi-d\u00e9lit. Ce sont les enfants, le conjoint par mariage, et m\u00eame un tiers, comme dans le cas typique que mentionne Demolombe, qui avait fait un contrat de soci\u00e9t\u00e9 avec le d\u00e9funt.\nIl est digne de remarque que notre code expose toute la loi de la responsabilit\u00e9 civile dans quatre articles d\u2019une r\u00e9daction n\u00e9cessairement g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, dont le dernier, l\u2019article 1056 C.C. est, dit-on, d\u2019origine anglaise. Je vais citer le premier et le dernier de ces quatre articles, qui suffisent pour la discussion de la question de principe, tr\u00e8s importante, assur\u00e9ment, dont il s\u2019agit en cette cause.\nArt. 1053. Toute personne capable de discerner le bien du mal, est responsable du dommage caus\u00e9 par sa faute \u00e0 autrui, soit par son fait, soit par imprudence, n\u00e9gligence ou inhabilet\u00e9.\nArt. 1066. Dans tous les cas o\u00f9 la partie contre qui le d\u00e9lit ou quasi-d\u00e9lit a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis d\u00e9c\u00e8de en cons\u00e9quence, sans avoir obtenu indemnit\u00e9 ou satisfaction, son conjoint, ses p\u00e8re, m\u00e8re et enfants ont, pendant l\u2019ann\u00e9e seulement \u00e0 compter du d\u00e9c\u00e8s, droit de poursuivre celui qui en est l\u2019auteur ou ses repr\u00e9sentants, pour les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats r\u00e9sultant de tel d\u00e9c\u00e8s.\nAu cas de duel\u2019, cette section peut se porter de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re non seulement contre l\u2019auteur imm\u00e9diat du d\u00e9c\u00e8s, mais aussi contre tous ceux qui ont pris part au duel soit comme seconds, soit comme t\u00e9moins.\nEn tout cas il ne peut \u00eatre port\u00e9 qu\u2019une seule et m\u00eame action pour tous ceux qui ont droit \u00e0 l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 et le jugement fixe la proportion de chacun dans l\u2019indemnit\u00e9. Ces poursuites sont ind\u00e9pendantes de celles dont les parties peuvent \u00eatre passibles au criminel, et sans pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 ces derni\u00e8res.\nIl s\u2019agit en cette cause de la responsabilit\u00e9 qui incombe \u00e0 l\u2019appelante \u00e0 raison d\u2019un quasi-d\u00e9lit commis par elle, et qui a inflig\u00e9 des \u201cinjures corporelles\u201d au fr\u00e8re Henri-Gabriel; c\u2019est l\u00e0 le fait g\u00e9n\u00e9rateur du dommage qu\u2019invoque l\u2019intim\u00e9e. L\u2019article 1056 C.C. ne peut s\u2019appliquer que lorsque\nla partie contre qui le d\u00e9lit ou quasi-d\u00e9lit a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis d\u00e9c\u00e8de en cons\u00e9quence.\nIl n\u2019est question l\u00e0 encore que d\u2019 \u201cinjures corporelles\u201d. L\u2019article 1053 C.C., il est \u00e9vident, envisage les d\u00e9lits et quasi-d\u00e9lits de tout genre, et non pas seulement ceux qui occasionnent des injures de cette sorte. Cependant, en interpr\u00e9tant cet article, je ne veux pas sortir de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce que nous avons devant nous, et tout ce que j\u2019en dirai se bornera au cas o\u00f9 le d\u00e9lit ou quasi-d\u00e9lit a caus\u00e9 de ces injures. J\u2019envisage donc une esp\u00e8ce qui entre, ou qui peut entrer, si la mort s\u2019ensuit, dans le cadre et de l\u2019article 1053 C.C. et de l\u2019article 1056 C.C.\nEnvisageant maintenant l\u2019article 1053 C.C., je puis dire qu\u2019il ne diff\u00e8re gu\u00e8re des articles 1382 et 1383 du Code Napol\u00e9on. C\u2019est le fait \u201cqui cause \u00e0 autrui un dommage\u201d, pour me servir de l\u2019expression du code fran\u00e7ais, qui engendre la responsabilit\u00e9 de celui par la faute duquel il arrive.\nOn peut admettre que l\u2019expression \u201cautrui\u201d, si elle n\u2019est pas restreinte par le contexte (et si on ne doit pas la regarder comme \u00e9tant \u00e9quivoque, surtout dans un texte l\u00e9gislatif, et partant comme se pla\u00e7ant dans la cat\u00e9gorie des expressions que l\u2019interpr\u00e8te doit restreindre plut\u00f4t qu\u2019\u00e9tendre), est d\u2019une port\u00e9e tr\u00e8s g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Elle comprendrait, suivant la pr\u00e9tention de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, non seulement \u201cla partie contre qui le d\u00e9lit ou quasi-d\u00e9lit a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis\u201d (c\u2019est l\u2019expression qu\u2019emploie l\u2019article 1056 C.C.), mais aussi toute personne qui souffre, je pourrais dire par ricochet, un pr\u00e9judice comme cons\u00e9quence du dommage \u00e9prouv\u00e9 par cette partie elle-m\u00eame.\nSauf \u00e0 discuter plus loin les arr\u00eats que cite l\u2019intim\u00e9e, la jurisprudence de la province de Qu\u00e9bec n\u2019a jamais donn\u00e9 une telle extension \u00e0 l\u2019article 1053 C.C. Le principe qui me para\u00eet dominer en mati\u00e8re de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats, c\u2019est que seuls les dommages directs, \u00e0 l\u2019exclusion des dommages indirects ou \u00e9loign\u00e9s, peuvent faire la base d\u2019une action en justice. Le code en a une disposition expresse quand il s\u2019agit de l\u2019inex\u00e9cution des obligations. Dans le cas m\u00eame o\u00f9 l\u2019inex\u00e9cution de l\u2019obligation r\u00e9sulte du dol du d\u00e9biteur, les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats ne comprennent que ce qui est une suite imm\u00e9diate et directe de cette inex\u00e9cution (art. 1075 C.C.). Si le d\u00e9biteur a agi sans dol\u2014c\u2019est le cas du quasi-d\u00e9lit qui est un dommage caus\u00e9 ill\u00e9galement, mais sans intention de nuire\u2014il n\u2019est tenu que des dommages qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9vus et qu\u2019on a pu pr\u00e9voir (art. 1074 C.C.). Il est vrai qu\u2019il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 surtout, mais non pas uniquement, cependant, de l\u2019inex\u00e9cution d\u2019une obligation contractuelle, mais il n\u2019y a pas plus de raison d\u2019accorder des dommages indirects ou \u00e9loign\u00e9s, surtout \u00e0 des tiers, lorsque l\u2019obligation d\u00e9coule d\u2019un d\u00e9lit ou quasi-d\u00e9lit, que lorsqu\u2019elle provient d\u2019un contrat.\nSur ce point j\u2019accepte pleinement le principe que le juge Mathieu a formul\u00e9 dans la cause de Kimball v. City of Montreal[68], savoir, que pour pouvoir se plaindre d\u2019un quasi-d\u00e9lit, il ne suffit pas que le fait imput\u00e9 ait \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019une des causes premi\u00e8res et \u00e9loign\u00e9es du dommage, mais il est n\u00e9cessaire que ce fait ait lui-m\u00eame d\u00e9termin\u00e9 directement le dommage, et qu\u2019il n\u2019en ait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 seulement l\u2019occasion indirecte et pour ainsi dire de seconde main. Le savant juge a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 aussi que les principes \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans l\u2019article 1075 C.C. sont applicables aux dommages r\u00e9clam\u00e9s en vertu de l\u2019article 1053 C.C.\nL\u2019article 1056 C.C. nous fournit \u00e0 l\u2019appui de cette solution un argument de texte. Il y est bien question de dommages indirects et \u00e9loign\u00e9s, mais le code accorde ces dommages par une disposition expresse et par exception \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle de l\u2019article 1053 C.C. qui, sans cette disposition, les exclurait. Si l\u2019article 1053 C.C. comporte l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation qui a pr\u00e9valu en cette cause, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire s\u2019il faut suivre la faute jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ses derni\u00e8res cons\u00e9quences et accorder autant d\u2019indemnit\u00e9s qu\u2019il y a de personnes l\u00e9s\u00e9es directement ou indirectement, l\u2019article 1056 C.C. est une disposition inutile. Il s\u2019harmonise au contraire avec l\u2019article 1053 C.C., si l\u2019expression \u201cautrui\u201d doit \u00eatre restreinte \u00e0 \u201cla partie contre qui le d\u00e9lit ou quasi-d\u00e9lit a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis\u201d, et alors l\u2019article 1056 C.C. admet une exception \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l\u2019article 1053 C.C. ainsi comprise.\nOn a beaucoup discut\u00e9 au sujet de l\u2019origine de l\u2019article 1056 C.C. Il vient des statuts refondus du Canada, 1859, chap. 78, qui reproduit le statut 10-11 Victoria, chap. 6 (1847). D\u2019apr\u00e8s le pr\u00e9ambule de cette derni\u00e8re loi,\nune personne qui, par sa malveillance, sa n\u00e9gligence ou son imp\u00e9ritie, peut avoir caus\u00e9 la mort d\u2019une autre personne, doit \u00eatre responsable des dommages caus\u00e9s par son fait.\nL\u2019article 1056 C.C. est entr\u00e9 au code sans avoir pass\u00e9 par les Rapports des codificateurs, et sans avoir figur\u00e9 parmi les amendements que la l\u00e9gislature fit au projet du code par la loi 29 Vict., c. 41. Cependant, il se trouve dans l\u2019\u00e9dition officielle du code imprim\u00e9e en 1866 par l\u2019imprimeur de la Reine, et on a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que cette \u00e9dition avait toujours eu force de loi dans la province (disposition formelle du statut 31 Vict. (Qu\u00e9.), c. 8, art. 10). Dans la cause de Robinson v. Canadian Pacific Ry. Co.[69], Lord Watson dit que cet article diff\u00e8re \u201csubstantially\u201d du Lord Campbell\u2019s Act, et il est aussi beaucoup plus restreint, quant aux personnes qui peuvent en b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier, que le chapitre 78 des statuts refondus du Canada qui s\u2019\u00e9tendait aux alli\u00e9s aux m\u00eames degr\u00e9s que les p\u00e8re et m\u00e8re et enfants. Peu importe, d\u2019ailleurs, l\u2019origine de l\u2019article 1056 C.C.; il a force de loi tout autant que l\u2019article 1053 C.C.\nL\u2019article 1056 C.C. donne, contre l\u2019auteur du d\u00e9lit ou quasi-d\u00e9lit dont meurt la victime, un recours en indemnit\u00e9 au conjoint, aux p\u00e8re et m\u00e8re et aux enfants de cette derni\u00e8re, indemnit\u00e9 qui comprend, non pas les dommages \u00e9prouv\u00e9s par la victime et qu\u2019on r\u00e9clamerait \u00e0 titre de succession, mais ceux que leur cause son d\u00e9c\u00e8s. Cette indemnit\u00e9, que les int\u00e9ress\u00e9s doivent r\u00e9clamer dans l\u2019ann\u00e9e du d\u00e9c\u00e8s, et par une seule et m\u00eame action, est accord\u00e9e \u00e0 la condition que la victime n\u2019ait pas elle-m\u00eame obtenu \u201cindemnit\u00e9 ou satisfaction\u201d. Si, donc, l\u2019auteur du d\u00e9lit ou quasi-d\u00e9lit a indemnis\u00e9 la victime, aucun recours n\u2019est ouvert \u00e0 son conjoint, ses p\u00e8re et m\u00e8re et enfants, quel que soit le pr\u00e9judice qu\u2019ils \u00e9prouvent par suite du d\u00e9c\u00e8s. En d\u2019autres termes, le paiement de la cr\u00e9ance en indemnit\u00e9 de la victime \u00e9teint l\u2019action de ses proches. Cette constatation est d\u2019une grande importance pour montrer que de droit commun \u201cla partie contre qui le d\u00e9lit ou quasi-d\u00e9lit a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis\u201d est celle qui poss\u00e8de l\u2019action en indemnit\u00e9 contre l\u2019auteur du fait d\u00e9lictueux.\nSi donc le d\u00e9lit ou quasi-d\u00e9lit est assez grave pour causer la mort de la victime, et si celle-ci n\u2019a pas obtenu avant son d\u00e9c\u00e8s \u201cindemnit\u00e9 ou satisfaction\u201d, les personnes mentionn\u00e9es en l\u2019article 1056 C.C., et pas d\u2019autres, peuvent recourir contre l\u2019auteur du fait d\u00e9lictueux, et lui r\u00e9clamer les dommages qui leur r\u00e9sultent du d\u00e9c\u00e8s. Leur action, lorsqu\u2019il y a ouverture, est ind\u00e9pendante de celle de la victime, sa prescription court \u00e0 partir du d\u00e9c\u00e8s, et il importerait peu que l\u2019action de la victime e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9teinte par prescription avant son d\u00e9c\u00e8s (Robinson v. Canadian Pacific Ry. Co.[70] ).\nOr, d\u2019apr\u00e8s le jugement frapp\u00e9 d\u2019appel, si la victime ne d\u00e9c\u00e8de pas des effets du d\u00e9lit ou quasi-d\u00e9lit, si m\u00eame elle a obtenu elle-m\u00eame \u201cindemnit\u00e9 ou satisfaction\u201d, les personnes mentionn\u00e9es en l\u2019article 1056, et non seulement ces personnes, mais tous autres int\u00e9ress\u00e9s, tels que l\u2019associ\u00e9 de la victime, peuvent r\u00e9clamer, contre l\u2019auteur du d\u00e9lit ou quasi-d\u00e9lit, les dommages qui leur r\u00e9sultent par contrecoup de ce d\u00e9lit ou quasi-d\u00e9lit.\nSi je comprends bien le raisonnement sur lequel s\u2019appuie la jurisprudence en France, et qui rend inutile une disposition dans le code Napol\u00e9on semblable \u00e0 notre article 1056, il repose sur la consid\u00e9ration suivante: Toute faute, qu\u2019elle soit d\u00e9lictuelle ou contractuelle, trouble l\u2019ordre social, et une indemnit\u00e9 doit \u00eatre pay\u00e9e \u00e0 tous ceux qui en souffrent. Ainsi un ouvrier est bless\u00e9 et rendu incapable de travailler par la faute de quelqu\u2019un. Cet ouvrier perd le salaire qu\u2019il aurait pu gagner, ses proches perdent le soutien qu\u2019ils auraient re\u00e7u de lui, le ma\u00eetre qui l\u2019employait perd ses services, et si le travail de l\u2019ouvrier \u00e9tait essentiel \u00e0 l\u2019entreprise du ma\u00eetre, celui-ci ne pourra pas tenir ses engagements envers ses cr\u00e9anciers, et ainsi de suite ad infinitum. (Voyez Demogue, Obligations, tome IV, p. 13, nos 525 et suivants.) On se perd \u00e0 suivre le lien de causalit\u00e9 aussi loin. Cependant, o\u00f9 peut-on s\u2019arr\u00eater dans le syst\u00e8me adopt\u00e9 par le savant juge de premi\u00e8re instance? Toute personne l\u00e9s\u00e9e par une faute, dit-il, doit \u00eatre indemnis\u00e9e, et il y a autant d\u2019indemnit\u00e9s distinctes qu\u2019il y a de personnes l\u00e9s\u00e9es. Si on ne se borne pas \u00e0 indemniser la partie contre qui le d\u00e9lit ou quasi-d\u00e9lit a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis, il faut suivre la faute jusqu\u2019en ses plus lointaines cons\u00e9quences, et c\u2019est la derni\u00e8re alternative qui r\u00e9sulterait de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation extensive de l\u2019article 1053 C.C.\nCette derni\u00e8re alternative, je le dis sans h\u00e9sitation mais avec toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence possible, n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 admise, avant ce litige, par une jurisprudence digne de ce nom dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec. Les complications de la vie moderne sont telles que cette doctrine aurait chez nous les cons\u00e9quences les plus graves. On ne peut l\u00e9ser un membre de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 sans porter pr\u00e9judice, par ricochet, \u00e0 un grand nombre de personnes qui ont avec lui des relations, soit de famille, soit d\u2019affaires. Un individu bless\u00e9 et rendu incapable de travailler peut se trouver dans l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 de payer ses dettes. Ses cr\u00e9anciers pourraient-ils pr\u00e9tendre que la perte de leur cr\u00e9ance est directement attribuable \u00e0 la blessure caus\u00e9e par la faute d\u2019un tiers, et partant \u00e0 cette faute m\u00eame? Un grand peintre ne peut plus exercer son art \u00e0 la suite d\u2019un accident occasionn\u00e9 par l\u2019imprudence d\u2019un conducteur d\u2019automobile. Le peintre indubitablement a droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9, mais les membres de sa famille, le marchand qui lui avait command\u00e9 un tableau, le client de ce marchand \u00e0 qui ce tableau avait \u00e9t\u00e9 vendu avant sa confection, le propri\u00e9taire de la galerie o\u00f9 cet \u0153uvre d\u2019art devait \u00eatre expos\u00e9, ne diront-ils pas qu\u2019ils subissent un pr\u00e9judice directement attribuable \u00e0 l\u2019imprudence du conducteur?\nJe ne puis concevoir que le l\u00e9gislateur, en r\u00e9digeant en termes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux l\u2019article 1053 C.C., ait voulu admettre une responsabilit\u00e9 s\u2019\u00e9tendant ainsi ind\u00e9finiment, et presque \u00e0 l\u2019infini, \u00e0 travers les rouages si compliqu\u00e9s de l\u2019existence moderne. C\u2019est toujours \u00e0 la jurisprudence fran\u00e7aise de nos jours que reviennent les partisans de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation extensive de cet article. Pour me contenter d\u2019une seule autorit\u00e9, cit\u00e9e du reste sans commentaires par le pr\u00e9sident de cette cour, Fuzier-Herman, Code Civil annot\u00e9, art. 1382- 1383, n\u00b0 686, enseigne que Faction en dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats appartient \u00e0 toute personne qui, soit directement, soit indirectement, \u00e9prouve un pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 raison du d\u00e9lit ou quasi-d\u00e9lit commis par le d\u00e9fendeur. Cette jurisprudence ne nous lie pas, et dans une esp\u00e8ce o\u00f9 on l\u2019invoquait comme r\u00e9gissant notre article 1054, et l\u2019\u00e9tendant aux actes du pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 faits \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de l\u2019exercice de ses fonctions, cette cour a refus\u00e9 de la suivre: Curley v. Latreille[71]. On a g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9 tellement les r\u00e8gles de la responsabilit\u00e9 civile en France, qu\u2019on n\u2019est pas tr\u00e8s loin du syst\u00e8me pr\u00e9conis\u00e9 par certains auteurs, savoir que toute activit\u00e9, m\u00eame sans faute, engage la responsabilit\u00e9 de celui qui s\u2019y livre.\nJe crois qu\u2019on serait bien en peine de trouver de semblables doctrines dans les vieux jurisconsultes, tels que Pothier et Domat. Et il est possible que la jurisprudence fran\u00e7aise moderne ait \u00e9t\u00e9 influenc\u00e9e, \u00e0 son insu, par des consid\u00e9rations d\u2019ordre social.\nJe ne puis accepter ce syst\u00e8me. Il rendrait, je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit, l\u2019article 1056 C.C. inutile, et cette disposition serait de plus d\u00e9raisonnable, puisque, dans un cas grave, celui de la mort de la victime, le recours des int\u00e9ress\u00e9s serait strictement limit\u00e9 \u00e0 certains proches, et une personne dans la situation de l\u2019intim\u00e9e serait exclue; tandis que dans un cas moins grave o\u00f9 la victime survit \u00e0 ses blessures, toute personne qui pourrait attribuer un pr\u00e9judice personnel \u00e0 la faute primitive, aurait, en vertu de l\u2019article 1053 C.C., un recours contre l\u2019auteur de cette faute.\nLe juge Dorion objecte que l\u2019article 1056 C.C. ne pr\u00e9voit que le cas de mort. Et il ajoute:\nS\u2019il semble illogique d\u2019accorder dans le cas de survie l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 que l\u2019on refuse dans le cas de mort, il faut se r\u00e9signer \u00e0 l\u2019illogisme cr\u00e9\u00e9 par l\u2019article 1056 C.C., qui introduit les dispositions du Lord Campbell\u2019s Act en marge de notre droit civil.\nIl me semble qu\u2019un raisonnement qui se r\u00e9signe aussi facilement au reproche d\u2019illogisme perd beaucoup de sa force persuasive. Dans le cas d\u2019une loi comme le Code civil, surtout dans une mati\u00e8re o\u00f9 le l\u00e9gislateur s\u2019est montr\u00e9 si sobre de formules, il faut assur\u00e9ment suivre la r\u00e8gle d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019article 1018 C.C. qui s\u2019applique aux lois comme aux contrats et dire que les articles du code s\u2019interpr\u00e8tent les uns par les autres, en donnant \u00e0 chacun le sens qui r\u00e9sulte de l\u2019ensemble de ses dispositions.\nC\u2019est bien l\u00e0 ce que reconnaissait Lord Sumner dans la cause de Quebec Railway, Light and Power Co. v. Vandry[72]:\nIt must not be forgotten, disait-il, what the enactment is, namely, a Code of systematized principles and rules, not a body of administrative directions or an institutional exposition. Il ajoutait: Of course also the Code, or at least the cognate articles, should be read as a whole, forming a connected scheme; they are not a series of detached enactments.\nEt en d\u00e9finitive le raisonnement qu\u2019on nous oppose s\u2019appuie moins sur les textes\u2014car on \u00e9tablit une v\u00e9ritable antinomie entre l\u2019article 1053 C.C. et l\u2019article 1056 C.C.\u2014que sur l\u2019autorit\u00e9 qu\u2019on attribue \u00e0 des arr\u00eats des tribunaux fran\u00e7ais qui ne nous lient en aucune fa\u00e7on. Du reste, ces tribunaux font l\u2019application d\u2019un code qui ne contient aucune disposition de la port\u00e9e de l\u2019article 1056 C.C. Je crois aussi que l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation constante qu\u2019on a donn\u00e9e dans la pratique \u00e0 l\u2019article 1053 C.C. en mati\u00e8re d\u2019 \u201cinjures corporelles\u201d, en indemnisant uniquement la partie contre qui le d\u00e9lit ou quasi-d\u00e9lit a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis, quand d\u2019autres consid\u00e9rations ne s\u2019appliquaient pas, s\u2019y oppose nettement.\nOn dit aussi que l\u2019article 1056 C.C. d\u00e9clare \u201cind\u00e9pendantes\u201d les poursuites qu\u2019elle autorise, et on en tire la conclusion que le droit d\u2019action en vertu de l\u2019article 1053 C.C. en faveur de toute personne l\u00e9s\u00e9e par le d\u00e9lit n\u2019est pas affect\u00e9 par le recours sp\u00e9cial et \u201cind\u00e9pendant\u201d de l\u2019article 1056 C.C. Qu\u2019on me permette de faire observer que c\u2019est mal lire l\u2019article 1056 C.C., dont le dernier alin\u00e9a dit seulement que ces poursuites sont ind\u00e9pendantes \u201cde celles dont les parties peuvent \u00eatre passibles au criminel\u201d. L\u2019emploi de l\u2019expression \u201cpoursuites ind\u00e9pendantes\u201d n\u2019a donc pas la port\u00e9e que lui pr\u00eate cet argument. J\u2019ajoute qu\u2019il s\u2019agit tant dans l\u2019article 1056 C.C. que dans l\u2019article 1053 C.C. d\u2019un recours purement civil, et le recours donn\u00e9 par l\u2019article 1056 C.C. est si loin d\u2019\u00eatre \u201cind\u00e9pendant\u201d du recours accord\u00e9 par l\u2019article 1053 C.C. qu\u2019il exclut absolument ce dernier recours dans les cas qui entrent dans le champ d\u2019application de l\u2019article 1056 C.C. L\u2019intim\u00e9e invoque certaines d\u00e9cisions des tribunaux de la province de Qu\u00e9bec. Elle n\u2019a trouv\u00e9 cependant que trois arr\u00eats qu\u2019elle croit \u00eatre favorables \u00e0 sa th\u00e8se.\nLa premi\u00e8re d\u00e9cision est celle de la cour du Banc de la Reine dans la cause de Cedar Shingle Co. v. La Cie d\u2019Assurance de Rimouski[73]. L\u2019appelante \u00e9tait locataire d\u2019un moulin qui fut incendi\u00e9 par son imprudence. Le propri\u00e9taire du moulin l\u2019avait fait assurer dans la compagnie intim\u00e9e, et celle-ci dut lui payer l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 convenue. La compagnie poursuivit alors l\u2019appelante, invoquant subrogation aux droits de l\u2019assur\u00e9, qui avait une action contre son locataire en vertu de l\u2019article 1629 C.C. Elle se basait \u00e9galement sur l\u2019article 2584 C.C., qui permet \u00e0 l\u2019assureur, lorsqu\u2019il paie l\u2019indemnit\u00e9, d\u2019exiger la subrogation aux droits de l\u2019assur\u00e9 contre la personne responsable du sinistre. Elle invoquait de plus l\u2019article 1053 C.C. La cour du Banc de la Reine fut cependant d\u2019avis qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait ni subrogation l\u00e9gale, ni subrogation conventionnelle, car toute l\u2019indemnit\u00e9e n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9e lors de la quittance. Mais elle fut d\u2019opinion que l\u2019article 1053 C.C. justifiait le jugement de la cour de premi\u00e8re instance contre l\u2019appelante.\nJ\u2019ai lu bien attentivement ce jugement. Le juge Boss\u00e9, qui parla au nom de la cour du Banc de la Reine, ne discute pas la question de principe et d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation que j\u2019ai envisag\u00e9e plus haut, mais cite certaines autorit\u00e9s fran\u00e7aises en mati\u00e8re d\u2019assurances, qui donnent effet, dans un cas semblable, aux articles 1382 et 1383 du Code Napol\u00e9on. Je ne crois pas qu\u2019une semblable d\u00e9cision puisse clore le d\u00e9bat.\nLe deuxi\u00e8me arr\u00eat est celui d\u2019Ortenberg v. Plamondon, cour d\u2019appel[74]. L\u2019intim\u00e9 Plamondon avait fait \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec une conf\u00e9rence publique o\u00f9 il accusait les juifs g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement de pratiques criminelles. Ortenberg, un juif de Qu\u00e9bec, pr\u00e9tendit que de telles d\u00e9clarations l\u2019exposaient au m\u00e9pris du public et lui causaient des dommages dans ses affaires. On appliqua l\u2019article 1053 C.C., d\u00e9cidant qu\u2019Ortenberg, bien qu\u2019il n\u2019e\u00fbt pas \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9, avait raison de se plaindre des accusations g\u00e9n\u00e9rales de Plamondon. Le juge Carroll exprima l\u2019avis que comme il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une collectivit\u00e9 peu nombreuse, 75 familles juives \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec sur une population de 80,000 \u00e2mes, l\u2019accusation ne se perdait pas dans le nombre, et que le demandeur pouvait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme suffisamment vis\u00e9 par les propos diffamatoires. Mais en tout cela on ne donnait aucune extension \u00e0 l\u2019article 1053 C.C., car Ortenberg, en tant que juif, \u00e9tait une des victimes du fait d\u00e9lictueux.\nLe troisi\u00e8me arr\u00eat, Faquin v. Grand Trunk Ry. Co. (Cour de Revision[75]), n\u2019autorise certainement pas l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation extensive qu\u2019on donne \u00e0 l\u2019article 1053 C.C. Un accident \u00e9tait survenu sur le chemin de fer de la d\u00e9fenderesse, et le Dr Paquin, avec d\u2019autres m\u00e9decins, avait donn\u00e9 des pansements aux bless\u00e9s le jour de l\u2019accident. Dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la cour a appliqu\u00e9 les r\u00e8gles qui r\u00e9gissent l\u2019action dite de in rem verso, trouvant que la d\u00e9fenderesse, qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9e de faire soigner les personnes bless\u00e9es par son imprudence, avait b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 des traitements donn\u00e9s par le demandeur. Il n\u2019y avait pas lieu d\u2019invoquer l\u2019article 1053 C.C., et, de fait, il n\u2019en a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 question dans le jugement du juge Larue qui parlait au nom de la cour de revision.\nJe crois donc que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 \u00e9tablir le bien-fond\u00e9 de sa r\u00e9clamation en la basant, ainsi qu\u2019elle le fait, sur l\u2019article 1053 C.C. Cela ne me para\u00eet souffrir aucun doute quant au chef de sa demande qui se rapporte \u00e0 la privation, par suite de l\u2019accident, des services du fr\u00e8re Henri-Gabriel.\nL\u2019autre chef de la demande, la r\u00e9clamation du co\u00fbt des soins m\u00e9dicaux et chirurgicaux que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a fait donner au fr\u00e8re Henri-Gabriel, \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, semble rentrer dans la ratio decidendi de la cause de Paquin v. Grand Trunk Ry. Co. (1) que j\u2019ai cit\u00e9e plus haut. L\u2019intim\u00e9e, dans son factum, invoque cet arr\u00eat par voie d\u2019analogie, mais elle s\u2019en tient toujours \u00e0 sa pr\u00e9tention que son droit d\u2019action d\u00e9coule du quasi-d\u00e9lit commis contre le fr\u00e8re Henri-Gabriel, ce dernier ayant eu droit, dit-elle, de recevoir ces soins de l\u2019intim\u00e9e en vertu du contrat qui existait entre eux.\nL\u2019arr\u00eat dans Paquin v. The Grand Trunk Ry. Co. (1), je l\u2019ai dit, est bas\u00e9 sur les r\u00e8gles qui r\u00e9gissent l\u2019action de in rem verso. J\u2019ai donc voulu examiner la question que soul\u00e8ve cette d\u00e9cision, afin de voir si l\u2019intim\u00e9e aurait pu justifier sa r\u00e9clamation du co\u00fbt des soins donn\u00e9s au fr\u00e8re Henri- Gabriel par les principes d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 sur lesquels se fonde le recours que donne cette action.\nDans le champ d\u2019op\u00e9ration des quasi-contrats, nous rencontrons d\u2019abord la gestion d\u2019affaires, et ensuite l\u2019action de in rem verso qu\u2019on aurait tort de confondre avec l\u2019action que donne cette gestion.\nL\u2019action de in rem verso n\u2019est pas nomm\u00e9e dans notre code, pas plus que dans le Code Napol\u00e9on; elle existe pourtant dans notre droit comme dans le droit fran\u00e7ais qui la tiennent tous deux du droit romain. Son fondement juridique est le grand principe d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 que nul ne doit s\u2019enrichir au d\u00e9triment d\u2019autrui.\nOn la compare quelquefois \u00e0 l\u2019action qui d\u00e9coule de la gestion d\u2019affaires, mais j\u2019ai dit qu\u2019il ne faut pas la confondre avec elle. Des diff\u00e9rences essentielles, en effet, existent entre les deux actions.\nIl y a gestion d\u2019affaires, negotiorum gestio, quand quelqu\u2019un assume volontairement la gestion de l\u2019affaire d\u2019un autre, sans la connaissance de ce dernier (art. 1043 C.C.). La gestion doit donc \u00eatre volontaire et intentionnelle (Baudry-Lacantinerie et Barde, Obligations, t. 4, n\u00b0 2792), et elle s\u2019exerce pour le compte du ma\u00eetre, avec les m\u00eames effets, si l\u2019affaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 bien administr\u00e9e, que s\u2019il y avait eu mandat entre le g\u00e9rant et le ma\u00eetre (arts. 1043, 1046 C.C.).\nAutre chose est l\u2019action de in rem verso. Elle suppose que le demandeur a fait une d\u00e9pense d\u2019argent ou d\u2019activit\u00e9 dont r\u00e9sulte l\u2019enrichissement du d\u00e9fendeur. Ainsi, comme dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce de Paquin v. Grand Trunk Ry. Co.[76], un m\u00e9decin a donn\u00e9 des soins \u00e0 des personnes bless\u00e9es par la faute du d\u00e9fendeur, et celui-ci a b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 de ces soins. Le demandeur a une action, dite de in rem verso, dont la mesure est le montant du b\u00e9n\u00e9fice, existant \u00e0 la date de l\u2019action, que le d\u00e9fendeur a retir\u00e9 de la d\u00e9pense ou de l\u2019activit\u00e9 du demandeur.\nNous pouvons \u00e9carter ici l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se de la gestion d\u2019affaires. L\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a jamais eu l\u2019intention de g\u00e9rer aucune affaire de l\u2019appelante. Elle a fait traiter m\u00e9dicalement le fr\u00e8re Henri-Gabriel, et elle a pay\u00e9 tous les frais du traitement, parce qu\u2019elle consid\u00e9rait qu\u2019elle en avait l\u2019obligation, soit en vertu d\u2019un contrat, soit parce que le fr\u00e8re bless\u00e9 \u00e9tait membre de sa congr\u00e9gation. Mais il pouvait bien y avoir lieu \u00e0 l\u2019action de in rem verso en faveur de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, si les conditions qui r\u00e9gissent ce recours se trouvaient accomplies.\nLa principale de ces conditions est l\u2019existence de l\u2019enrichissement\u2014c\u2019est le terme dont se servent les auteurs\u2014au moment de la demande. Ainsi nous lisons dans Fuzier-Herman, vo Gestion d\u2019affaires, n\u00b0 163, o\u00f9 il est question de l\u2019action de in rem verso, ce qui suit:\nCette action se distingue de l\u2019action negotiorum gestorum en ce que pour celle-ci il suffit que l\u2019acte du g\u00e9rant ait \u00e9t\u00e9 utile au moment o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 entrepris, tandis que pour celle-l\u00e0 (l\u2019action de in rem. verso), quand il s\u2019agit de d\u00e9terminer la somme \u00e0 payer par le propri\u00e9taire qui s\u2019est enrichi par le fait du g\u00e9rant, il faut se placer au moment de la demande et ne consid\u00e9rer que l\u2019utilit\u00e9 finale.\nIl y a un cas\u2014et cela nous rapproche de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce\u2014o\u00f9 il y a ouverture \u00e0 l\u2019action de in rem verso. C\u2019est lorsqu\u2019un tiers paie au cr\u00e9ancier la dette du d\u00e9biteur, comme l\u2019article 1141 C.C. lui permet de faire. Le recours du tiers contre le d\u00e9biteur (je suppose qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas mandat expr\u00e8s ou tacite entre eux et que le tiers a pay\u00e9 en son nom) est par voie de l\u2019action de in rem verso. Mais observons avec Baudry-Lacantinerie et Barde, Obligations, t. 2, n\u00b0 1399, p. 505:\nSi le tiers non int\u00e9ress\u00e9 (l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 faire le paiement n\u2019a aucune importance ici) a pay\u00e9 en son propre nom, il pourra, en principe, agir contre le d\u00e9biteur par Faction de in rem verso, car on ne doit pas supposer qu\u2019il y a eu: donation de la part du tiers. Cette action a sa source dans ce principe d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 que nul ne doit s\u2019enrichir au d\u00e9triment d\u2019autrui, mais elle ne permet d\u2019agir que dans la mesure de l\u2019enrichissement procur\u00e9 \u00e0 celui contre qui elle est dirig\u00e9e. Ainsi, dans notre cas, s\u2019il est prouv\u00e9 que le cr\u00e9ancier e\u00fbt accord\u00e9 au d\u00e9biteur des remises partielles ou des d\u00e9lais, il faudrait en tenir compte. De m\u00eame, si la prescription \u00e9tait sur le point d\u2019\u00eatre acquise au d\u00e9biteur, l\u2019action de in rem verso se prescrirait par le laps de temps qui aurait suffi pour parfaire la prescription de la dette pay\u00e9e.\nPour compl\u00e9ter la pens\u00e9e des auteurs que je viens de citer, je dois dire qu\u2019avant ce passage, ils avaient envisag\u00e9 le cas o\u00f9 le tiers a pay\u00e9 la cr\u00e9ance au nom du d\u00e9biteur, et alors, disaient-ils, il y a lieu \u00e0 l\u2019action de gestion d\u2019affaires. Rien de tel n\u2019existe en cette cause.\nJe puis encore citer Huc, t. 8, n\u00b0 10, p. 20:\nSi le paiement a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait dans les conditions ordinaires, sans protestations de la part du d\u00e9biteur, le recours du solvens se traduira, selon le cas, soit par Faction de mandat, soit surtout par l\u2019action de gestion d\u2019affaires (arts. 1375, 2001 C.N.), soit, si le solvens a pay\u00e9 en son propre nom, par l\u2019action de in rem verso. Ces deux actions ne sont pas r\u00e9gies par les m\u00eames principes; ainsi, dans le cas de l\u2019action de in rem verso, le solvens n\u2019aura pas interrompu la prescription, il l\u2019aura au contraire interrompue dans le cas de gestion d\u2019affaires.\nIl est inutile de multiplier les citations. Elles indiquent que la condition du d\u00e9biteur poursuivi par voie de Faction de in rem verso ne doit pas \u00eatre rendue pire parce qu\u2019un tiers a pay\u00e9 sa dette \u00e0 son cr\u00e9ancier. Sp\u00e9cialement, si la prescription \u00e9tait en cours lors du paiement, elle ne sera pas interrompue, et l\u2019action de in rem verso se prescrira par le laps de temps qui aurait suffi pour parfaire la prescription de la dette pay\u00e9e.\nAppliquons cette doctrine \u00e0 l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Si, comme je le crois, la v\u00e9ritable action qui appartenait \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 cause de son paiement des soins m\u00e9dicaux et chirurgicaux donn\u00e9s au fr\u00e8re Henri-Gabriel, \u00e9tait l\u2019action de in rem verso, comme dans le cas de Paquin v. Grand Trunk Ry. Co.[77], l\u2019intim\u00e9e devait, \u00e0 peine de d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance, l\u2019intenter dans l\u2019ann\u00e9e de l\u2019accident (art. 2262 C.C.). Car le fr\u00e8re Henri-Gabriel \u00e9tait, \u00e0 raison des \u201cinjures corporelles\u201d qu\u2019il avait subies par la faute de l\u2019appelante, cr\u00e9ancier de celle-ci, et en payant le co\u00fbt des soins n\u00e9cessit\u00e9s par ces \u201cinjures\u201d, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a pay\u00e9 la cr\u00e9ance qu\u2019il avait de ce chef contre l\u2019appelante.\nJe conclus donc que la r\u00e9clamation de l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne peut se justifier par l\u2019article 1053 C.C. L\u2019intim\u00e9e aurait bien pu, en temps utile, se pourvoir contre l\u2019appelante par l\u2019action de in rem verso pour r\u00e9clamer le co\u00fbt des soins qu\u2019elle a fait donner\u2014sans aucun mandat \u00e0 cet effet, et sans pr\u00e9tendre exercer aucune gestion d\u2019affaires pour le compte de l\u2019appelante\u2014au fr\u00e8re Henri-Gabriel; mais la poursuite ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 intent\u00e9e apr\u00e8s l\u2019expiration de l\u2019ann\u00e9e, et alors que le droit d\u2019action du fr\u00e8re Henri-Gabriel \u00e9tait \u00e9teint, cette poursuite n\u2019est plus recevable par les tribunaux.\nJ\u2019ai examin\u00e9 avec soin les nombreux arr\u00eats de la province de Qu\u00e9bec que cite le pr\u00e9sident de cette cour. Aucune de ces d\u00e9cisions ne nous lie, et les plus extr\u00eames sont absolument isol\u00e9es. Beaucoup d\u2019entre elles se rapportent au recours de l\u2019assureur contre le feu contre, les auteurs fautifs du sinistre. Les plus r\u00e9centes s\u2019inspirent du jugement de la cour du Banc de la Reine dans Cedar Shingle Co. v. La Cie d\u2019Assur. de Rimouski[78] que j\u2019ai cit\u00e9 plus haut. J\u2019aime mieux l\u2019ancienne d\u00e9cision de Quebec Fire Insurance Co. v. Molson et al[79], sur laquelle les codificateurs basent l\u2019article 2584 du code civil. Quelle est l\u2019utilit\u00e9 de cet article si l\u2019assureur, sans subrogation, peut fonder son recours sur l\u2019article 1053 C.C.?\nEncore une fois, nous n\u2019avons pas chez nous une jurisprudence digne de ce nom qui nous autoriserait \u00e0 admettre l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation extensive de l\u2019article 1053 C.C., avec ses cons\u00e9quences d\u2019une telle gravit\u00e9 pratique. Pour ma part, je ne puis accueillir cette interpr\u00e9tation. L\u2019esp\u00e8ce est sans doute int\u00e9ressante, mais ce ne serait pas une raison de faire fl\u00e9chir les principes dans une mati\u00e8re qui est d\u2019ordre public. J\u2019ai d\u00e9montr\u00e9 d\u2019ailleurs que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019\u00e9tait pas sans recours pour recouvrer les sommes qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9pens\u00e9es pour faire soigner le fr\u00e8re Henri-Gabriel. Son malheur est de n\u2019avoir pas exerc\u00e9 ce recours en temps utile.\nIl s\u2019ensuit que l\u2019appel doit \u00eatre accord\u00e9, et que l\u2019action de l\u2019intim\u00e9e doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9e avec d\u00e9pens dans toutes les cours contre l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\nRinfret, J. (dissenting).\u2014Nous ne sommes pas appel\u00e9s, pour la solution de cette cause, \u00e0 interpr\u00e9ter l\u2019article 1053 du code civil dans son application g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\nIl s\u2019agit ici d\u2019un cas que, pour employer les expressions du code, il me faut d\u00e9signer sous le nom d\u2019 \u201cinjures corporelles\u201d.\nEn France, tout le sujet des d\u00e9lits et des quasi-d\u00e9lits est r\u00e9gi par les articles 1382, 1383, 1384, 1385 et 1386 du code civil, qui correspondent aux articles 1053, 1054 et 1055 du code de la province de Qu\u00e9bec. Mais le code fran\u00e7ais ne contient pas d\u2019article \u00e9quivalent \u00e0 l\u2019article 1056 du code de Qu\u00e9bec. C\u2019est l\u00e0 une diff\u00e9rence extr\u00eamement importante, car elle a pour effet et pour r\u00e9sultat, dans une question comme celle qui nous est soumise, de rendre inapplicable la doctrine expos\u00e9e par les auteurs fran\u00e7ais et la jurisprudence \u00e9tablie par les tribunaux fran\u00e7ais.\nDans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, en effet, alors que tous les autres cas de d\u00e9lits et de quasi-d\u00e9lits sont r\u00e9gis uniquement par l\u2019article 1053 C.C. (avec les additions qui y sont apport\u00e9es par les articles 1054 et 1055 C.C.) les cas d\u2019 \u201cinjures corporelles\u201d sont, en plus, subordonn\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019article 1056 C.C., qui les concerne exclusivement. Le l\u00e9gislateur a manifest\u00e9 son intention d\u2019envisager ces cas d\u2019une fa\u00e7on particuli\u00e8re en \u00e9dictant ce dernier article et en leur imposant la prescription sp\u00e9ciale d\u2019un an pr\u00e9vue par l\u2019article 2262 C.C. Il faut donner effet \u00e0 cette intention.\nLe jugement de notre coll\u00e8gue, M. le Juge Mignault, n\u2019entend pas sortir du cadre d\u2019un d\u00e9lit ou quasi-d\u00e9lit causant d\u00e9s \u201cinjures corporelles\u201d. Tout ce qu\u2019il dit de l\u2019article 1053 C.C., modifi\u00e9 en pareil cas par l\u2019article 1056 C.C., se borne \u00e0 une esp\u00e8ce de ce genre. Je suis d\u2019accord avec ses vues sur ce point; et comme, par ailleurs, j\u2019accepte \u00e9galement l\u2019opinion qu\u2019il exprime sur le recours de in rem verso, j\u2019en arrive donc aux m\u00eames conclusions que les siennes.\nIl est important de pr\u00e9ciser d\u2019abord que la demanderesse, du vivant de \u201cla partie contre qui le * * * quasi-d\u00e9lit a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis\u201d (c\u2019est le texte m\u00eame de l\u2019article 1056 C.C.) avait r\u00e9clam\u00e9 \u00e0 titre de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats une somme de $4,780\npour frais de m\u00e9decins, frais d\u2019h\u00f4pitaux et de garde-malades, m\u00e9dicaments et op\u00e9rations;\n$10,000 pour dommages g\u00e9n\u00e9raux; et $118 parce que\nles habits du fr\u00e8re (Henri-Gabriel) ont \u00e9t\u00e9 en partie d\u00e9truits, ainsi que des effets qu\u2019il avait avec lui et qu\u2019il a fallu payer pour le transport du fr\u00e8re \u00e0 (Montr\u00e9al.\nLe tribunal de premi\u00e8re instance lui a accord\u00e9 la somme de $2,236.90 pour les\nsoins de m\u00e9decins, frais d\u2019h\u00f4pitaux et de garde-malades, m\u00e9dicaments et op\u00e9rations,\nsuivant des chiffres qui sont soigneusement d\u00e9taill\u00e9s dans le jugement. Il a accord\u00e9, en outre, une somme de $1,763.10 (soit: la diff\u00e9rence entre le montant de $2,236.90 et celui de $4,000 qui repr\u00e9sente le total de l\u2019adjudication) parce que\nla demanderesse a subi des dommages \u00e0 raison de la perte des services d\u2019un professeur qui \u00e9tait en m\u00eame temps un auteur estim\u00e9, de l\u2019obligation de le remplacer et des d\u00e9penses qu\u2019il lui a occasionn\u00e9es jusqu\u2019\u00e0 sa mort, \u00e9tant devenu un membre inutile dans la communaut\u00e9.\nLe jugement accorde donc une indemnit\u00e9 pour des dommages sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9s qui n\u2019incluent pas la somme de $118 qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9clam\u00e9e pour les habits que le fr\u00e8re portait lors de l\u2019accident, \u201cainsi que les effets qu\u2019il avait avec lui.\u201d Il me faut signaler cela, car les habits et les effets du fr\u00e8re appartenaient \u00e0 la demanderesse; et si la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure lui en avait accord\u00e9 la valeur \u00e0 titre de dommages, cet item devrait probablement faire l\u2019objet de consid\u00e9ration toutes diff\u00e9rentes de celle qui s\u2019appliquent aux dommages r\u00e9sultant des \u201cinjures corporelles\u201d. Je tiens donc \u00e0 \u00e9tablir le fait que mon jugement, non plus que celui de M. le Juge Mignault (comme je le comprends), ne s\u2019adresse en aucune fa\u00e7on \u00e0 cette r\u00e9clamation de $118.\nPour d\u00e9cider si l\u2019action de la demanderesse \u00e9tait redevable pour r\u00e9clamer les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9s, il faut examiner non pas une doctrine et une jurisprudence \u00e9difi\u00e9es uniquement sur une l\u00e9gislation correspondant \u00e0 notre seul article 1053 C.C.; mais il faut d\u00e9terminer jusqu\u2019\u00e0 quel point la g\u00e9n\u00e9ralit\u00e9 de cet article est, en mati\u00e8re d\u2019 \u201cinjures corporelles\u201d, modifi\u00e9e par l\u2019article 1056 C.C.\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 dans le \u201cConsid\u00e9rant\u201d suivant la doctrine des auteurs et des tribunaux fran\u00e7ais ou belges sur laquelle elle a appuy\u00e9 son jugement:\nConsid\u00e9rant que toute personne l\u00e9s\u00e9e par une faute doit \u00eatre indemnis\u00e9e; qu\u2019il y a, en principe, autant d\u2019indemnit\u00e9s distinctes qu\u2019il y a de personnes l\u00e9s\u00e9es.\nC\u2019est ce principe qui a \u00e9galement servi de base au jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi. Or, il me semble tr\u00e8s respectueusement que l\u2019article 1056 du Code civil de Qu\u00e9bec dit pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment le contraire. De toute \u00e9vidence, il n\u2019y a pas, en vertu de cet article, \u201cautant d\u2019indemnit\u00e9s distinctes qu\u2019il y a de personnes l\u00e9s\u00e9es\u201d. L\u2019action appartient exclusivement aux personnes mentionn\u00e9es dans l\u2019article, qui est restrictif et doit \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 la lettre. St-Laurent v. La Compagnie de T\u00e9l\u00e9phone de Kamouraska[80]; Gohier v. Allan[81].\nIl est sans doute pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable de mettre sous nos yeux le texte des articles qui font l\u2019objet de la discussion:\n1053. Toute personne capable de discerner le bien du mal, est responsable du dommage caus\u00e9 par sa faute \u00e0 autrui, soit par son fait, soit par imprudence, n\u00e9gligence ou inhabilet\u00e9.\nIl est suffisant de reproduire le premier et le troisi\u00e8me paragraphe de l\u2019article 1056 C.C., vu que le second paragraphe n\u2019a trait qu\u2019au duel et que le quatri\u00e8me paragraphe s\u2019occupe seulement de l\u2019effet de l\u2019action civile sur l\u2019action criminelle:\n1056. Dans tous les cas o\u00f9 la partie contre qui le d\u00e9lit ou quasi-d\u00e9lit a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis d\u00e9c\u00e8de en cons\u00e9quence, sans avoir obtenu indemnit\u00e9 ou satisfaction, son conjoint, ses p\u00e8re, m\u00e8re et enfants ont, pendant l\u2019ann\u00e9e seulement, \u00e0 compter du d\u00e9c\u00e8s, droit de poursuivre celui qui en est l\u2019auteur ou ses repr\u00e9sentants, pour les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats r\u00e9sultant de tel d\u00e9c\u00e8s.\n* * *\nEn tout cas il ne peut \u00eatre port\u00e9 qu\u2019une seule et m\u00eame action pour tous ceux qui ont droit \u00e0 l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 et le jugement fixe la proportion de chacun dans l\u2019indemnit\u00e9.\n1056. In all cases where the person injured by the commission of an offence or a quasi-offence dies in consequence, without having obtained indemnity or satisfaction his consort and his ascendant and descendant relations have a right, but only within a year after his death, to recover from the person who committed the offence or quasi-offence, or his representatives, all damages occasioned by such death.\n* * *\nIn all cases no more than one action can be brought in behalf of those who are entitled to the indemnity and the judgment determines the proportion of such indemnity which each is to receive.\nJ\u2019ai reproduit la version fran\u00e7aise et la version anglaise pour qu\u2019on puisse tenir compte, s\u2019il y a lieu, des divergences qui existent entre elles.\nIl me para\u00eet suffisant de lire ce texte pour constater qu\u2019on ne saurait lui appliquer la doctrine sur laquelle on s\u2019est appuy\u00e9 en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et en Cour du Banc du Roi, comme par exemple celle-ci (Huc, vol. 8, n\u00b0 420):\nSelon la formule de la Cour de Cassation: \u201cLe fait dommageable ouvre une action en dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats au profit de toute personne qui a souffert un pr\u00e9judice direct r\u00e9sultant de ce fait\u201d, qu\u2019elle soit ou non h\u00e9riti\u00e8re de la victime,\nou encore celle-ci que l\u2019on extrait de Laurent (vol. 20, n\u00b0 534):\nLa loi donne l\u2019action pour le dommage caus\u00e9 \u00e0 tous ceux qui sont l\u00e9s\u00e9s par le fait dommageable. Ce principe r\u00e9sulte de la g\u00e9n\u00e9rallit\u00e9 des termes de l\u2019article 1382; il est consacr\u00e9 par la jurisprudence. La Cour de Cassation l\u2019a formul\u00e9 dans les termes suivants, \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de la mort instantan\u00e9e d\u2019une personne par suite d\u2019un accident de chemin de fer: \u201cLe fait dommageable ouvre une action en dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats au profit de toute personne qui a souffert un pr\u00e9judice direct r\u00e9sultant de ce fait.\u201d (Rejet, 21 juillet 1869, D. 72, 5, 386, n. 1.)\nou encore celle-ci, qu\u2019on nous cite de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9e et qui est tir\u00e9e de Fuzier-Herman, III, Code civil annot\u00e9, sous les articles 1382 et 1383: 688. L\u2019action en r\u00e9paration du pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9 par un accident (sp\u00e9cialement par un accident suivi de mort) n\u2019appartient donc pas seulement \u00e0 la victime de l\u2019accident ou \u00e0 ses h\u00e9ritiers, mais encore \u00e0 quiconque, h\u00e9ritier ou non de la victime, se trouve directement l\u00e9s\u00e9 par les cons\u00e9quences de l\u2019accident. Alger, 23 mai 1892 (S. 94, 2, 62; D. 94, 2, 47).\nJ\u2019ai choisi ces citations simplement comme exemple pour mieux d\u00e9montrer le danger qu\u2019il y aurait de s\u2019inspirer de la doctrine et de la jurisprudence fran\u00e7aises pour interpr\u00e9ter la loi de la province de Qu\u00e9bec dans la cause qui nous est soumise.\nComme l\u2019a d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit M. le Juge Taschereau dans la premi\u00e8re cause du Canadian Pacific Railway v. Robinson[82], et tel que l\u2019a r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 M. le Juge en chef Lamothe dans la cause de Hunter v. Gingras[83], if faut bien remarquer que l\u2019article 1056 C.C. n\u2019a pas accord\u00e9 un droit nouveau aux personnes qui y sont \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es. Il a, au contraire, restreint et limit\u00e9 le recours qui pouvait appartenir ant\u00e9rieurement au code \u00e0 ceux qui subissaient des dommages \u00e0 raison d\u2019 \u201cinjures corporelles\u201d inflig\u00e9es \u00e0 une personne. En effet, M. le Juge Taschereau et M. le Juge Lamothe soulignent quatre restrictions apport\u00e9es par l\u2019article 1056 C.C.:\nThe statute and the code entirely changed the laws. 1st, As to prescription; by article 2261 C.C. it would be two years; 2nd, As to the parties entitled to the action; 3rd, In giving only one action to all the parties injured; 4th, In denying, as in England, the action where the deceased party had himself obtained an indemnity.\nJe ne crois pas que l\u2019article 1056 C.C. ne pr\u00e9voit que le \u201ccas de mort\u201d, comme on le pr\u00e9tend. Cet article, combin\u00e9 avec l\u2019article 1053 C.C., couvre l\u2019ensemble de la responsabilit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019 \u201cinjures corporelles\u201d. L\u2019on ne saurait d\u00e9cider cette cause uniquement en vertu de l\u2019article 1053 C.C. sans tenir compte de l\u2019article 1056 C.C. L\u2019article 1053 C.C. \u00e9tablit la base de la responsabilit\u00e9, l\u2019article 1056 C.C. d\u00e9clare dans quels cas et vis-\u00e0-vis de quelles personnes cette responsabilit\u00e9 existera pour des dommages r\u00e9sultant d\u2019 \u201cinjures corporelles\".\nLa r\u00e9clamation de l\u2019intim\u00e9e est pour les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats qu\u2019elle all\u00e8gue avoir soufferts par suite des \u201cinjures corporelles\u201d inflig\u00e9es au fr\u00e8re Henri-Gabriel. Il n\u2019y a pas de distinction d\u2019ordre juridique entre la base, le caract\u00e8re et la nature de cette r\u00e9clamation et ceux de la r\u00e9clamation qui appartiendrait aux \u201cconjoint, p\u00e8re, m\u00e8re et enfants\u201d de la victime imm\u00e9diate de l\u2019accident. Que les \u201cinjures corporelles\u201d soient, ou non, suivies de mort, la responsabilit\u00e9 vis-\u00e0-vis des personnes autres que la victime est, du point de vue l\u00e9gal, absolument du m\u00eame ordre. Le l\u00e9gislateur a indiqu\u00e9 express\u00e9ment que ce genre de r\u00e9clamation est class\u00e9 dans la cat\u00e9gorie des actions r\u00e9sultant d\u2019 \u201cinjures corporelles\u201d puisque, par l\u2019article 2262 C.C., il excepte sp\u00e9cialement de la prescription \u00e9dict\u00e9e contre ces actions \u201cles dispositions contenues en l\u2019article 1056 C.C.\u201d\nPour d\u00e9cider s\u2019il y a lieu d\u2019admettre la r\u00e9clamation de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, il faut donc lire et analyser ensemble les articles 1053 et 1056 C.C. et les interpr\u00e9ter l\u2019un par l\u2019autre.\nPour les fins de cette interpr\u00e9tation, nous ne pouvons mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 la r\u00e8gle pos\u00e9e par le Conseil priv\u00e9:\nAn appeal to earlier law and decisions for the purpose of interpreting the provisions of a statutory Code can only be justified on some special ground, such as the doubtful import or previously acquired meaning of the language used therein (Robinson v. Canadian Pacific Ry. Co.[84]\nThe Quebec Civil Code should be interpreted in the first instance solely according to the words used, the code, or at least cognate articles, being read as a whole forming a complete scheme. It is only if the meaning is not plain that light should be sought from exterior sources, such as decisions in Quebec earlier than the code or the exposition of similar articles of the Code Napol\u00e9on. (Quebec Ry. L.H. & P. Co. v. Vandry)[85].\nS\u2019il faut appeler \u00e0 l\u2019aide de cette r\u00e8gle, l\u2019apport que peut ajouter le c\u00f4t\u00e9 historique d\u2019une l\u00e9gislation, nous savons d\u00e9j\u00e0 par les jugements de M. le juge Taschereau et de M. le juge Lamothe que l\u2019article 1056 C.C. n\u2019introduit pas un droit nouveau, mais qu\u2019il vient modifier, pour le cas particulier des \u201cinjures corporelles\u201d, le principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral pos\u00e9 par l\u2019art. 1053 C.C. Il s\u2019ensuit qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas eu pour but d\u2019accorder aux parents d\u2019une victime d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e un recours qu\u2019ils n\u2019auraient pas eu autrement, puisqu\u2019il est conc\u00e9d\u00e9 que ce recours a toujours exist\u00e9 dans le droit du Qu\u00e9bec et que la r\u00e8gle: \u201cActio personalis moritur cum persona\u201d n\u2019y a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9e.\nL\u2019article 1056 C.C. n\u2019est donc l\u00e0 que pour modifier l\u2019article 1053 C.C.\nNi M, le Juge Taschereau, ni M. le Juge Lamothe ne me paraissent avoir eu l\u2019intention, dans les jugements pr\u00e9cit\u00e9s, de limiter \u00e0 celles qu\u2019ils ont \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es les restrictions apport\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019article 1053 C.C. par l\u2019article 1056 C.C.\nLa combinaison de ces deux articles indique que le mot \u201cautrui\u201d dans 1053 C.C. correspond \u00e0 \u201cla partie contre qui le d\u00e9lit ou quasi-d\u00e9lit a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis\u201d (person injured) dans 1056 C.C. Ces derniers mots sont limit\u00e9s \u00e0 la victime imm\u00e9diate, puisque l\u2019article se lit:\nDans tous les cas o\u00f9 la partie contre qui le d\u00e9lit ou le quasi-d\u00e9lit a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis d\u00e9c\u00e8de en cons\u00e9quence.\nCela ne peut s\u2019appliquer qu\u2019\u00e0 la victime imm\u00e9diate des \u201cinjures corporelles\u201d.\nOr, ce n\u2019est que dans ce cas: lorsque la victime imm\u00e9diate \u201cd\u00e9c\u00e8de en cons\u00e9quence\u201d et, en outre, \u201csans avoir obtenu indemnit\u00e9 ou satisfaction\u201d, que certaines autres personnes, parmi lesquelles ne figure pas l\u2019intim\u00e9e, ont droit \u00e0 un recours en dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats.\nCes personnes seules ont le \u201cdroit de poursuivre\u201d; les autres sont \u00e9limin\u00e9es. M\u00eame elles n\u2019ont ce droit que si la victime imm\u00e9diate \u201cd\u00e9c\u00e8de en cons\u00e9quence, sans avoir obtenu indemnit\u00e9\u201d; et alors, seulement \u201cpour les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats r\u00e9sultant de tel d\u00e9c\u00e8s\u201d; et ils doivent les r\u00e9clamer par \u201cune seule et m\u00eame action\u201d.\nIl ne s\u2019agit pas de nier le droit d\u2019action. Il s\u2019agit de le concentrer dans la personne de la victime tant qu\u2019elle vit. Nul ne conteste que le fr\u00e8re Henri-Gabriel e\u00fbt eu le droit, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, de recouvrer les $2,236.90 qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 octroy\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e pour d\u00e9penses m\u00e9dicales, mais ce droit appartenait \u00e0 lui seul. L\u2019intim\u00e9e ne peut pr\u00e9tendre avoir subi ces d\u00e9penses que parce qu\u2019elle les a pay\u00e9es; mais elle les a pay\u00e9es pour le fr\u00e8re Henri-Gabriel et en ses lieu et place.\nOn ne subit pas des dommages, au sens l\u00e9gal, parce qu\u2019on juge \u00e0 propos d\u2019acquitter les comptes de m\u00e9decin d\u2019une autre personne. Et, en tout cas, on ne les subit pas par la faute de l\u2019auteur du d\u00e9lit.\nOn peut les payer \u00e0 titre de lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9 et alors il n\u2019en r\u00e9sulte aucun recours en remboursement.\nOn peut le faire pour le compte du malade ou du bless\u00e9. Dans ce cas, il n\u2019y a certainement pas subrogation l\u00e9gale. Il pourrait peut-\u00eatre y avoir subrogation conventionnelle dans les droits de l\u00e0 victime contre l\u2019auteur du d\u00e9lit. Mais alors le recours n\u2019existera que par suite de cette subrogation et, comme cons\u00e9quence, ce recours se bornera aux droits que la victime elle-m\u00eame aurait pu exercer. En fait, ce seront les propres droits de la victime que celui qui a pay\u00e9 pourra exercer.\nOn peut encore supposer le cas o\u00f9 le tiers a pay\u00e9 les frais m\u00e9dicaux et les r\u00e9clame par voie de l\u2019action de in rem verso. Ce point est discut\u00e9 au long dans le jugement de M. le juge Mignault.\nDans aucun cas, le tiers qui paie les frais m\u00e9dicaux d\u2019un autre ne peut r\u00e9clamer ces frais \u00e0 titre de dommages subis par lui-m\u00eame. L\u2019action par laquelle il les r\u00e9clame ne peut donc \u00eatre bas\u00e9e sur les articles 1053 et 1056 du code civil.\nIl en est de m\u00eame des autres sommes accord\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e\n\u00e0 raison de la perte des services d\u2019un professeur estim\u00e9, de l\u2019obligation de le remplacer et des d\u00e9penses qu\u2019il a occasionn\u00e9es, etc.\nTous ces dommages eussent \u00e9t\u00e9 couverts par une indemnit\u00e9 au fr\u00e8re Henri-Gabriel pour perte de temps et incapacit\u00e9 r\u00e9sultant du quasi-d\u00e9lit commis contre lui. C\u2019est la mani\u00e8re ordinaire de r\u00e9damer ce genre de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats et c\u2019est sous cette forme qu\u2019ils sont toujours octroy\u00e9s. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, on les a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s sous une autre forme et on leur a donn\u00e9 un autre nom, pour tenter d\u2019obvier \u00e0 l\u2019objection de prescription qui frappait l\u2019action personnelle du fr\u00e8re. J\u2019\u00e9prouve une difficult\u00e9 insurmontable \u00e0 admettre que l\u2019on puisse ainsi obtenir indirectement ce que l\u2019on ne peut plus r\u00e9clamer directement.\nSi l\u2019on y r\u00e9fl\u00e9chit bien, l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 que la victime est en droit de r\u00e9clamer couvre tous les dommages qui r\u00e9sultent directement des \u201cinjures corporelles\u201d qu\u2019elle a subies. Les tiers ne sont affect\u00e9s que par les cons\u00e9quences qui en d\u00e9coulent indirectement par suite de l\u2019incapacit\u00e9 de la victime. L\u2019indemnit\u00e9 que la victime a le droit de recevoir de l\u2019auteur du d\u00e9lit ou du quasi-d\u00e9lit est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e \u00eatre une compensation enti\u00e8re et ad\u00e9quate pour cette incapacit\u00e9.\nTant que survit la victime imm\u00e9diate, le recours pour r\u00e9clamer les dommages qui r\u00e9sultent de ses \u201cinjures corporelles\u201d appartient donc \u00e0 elle seule.\nC\u2019est par cette interpr\u00e9tation seulement qu\u2019on emp\u00eache l\u2019illogisme qui existerait autrement\u2014et qui est signal\u00e9 par M. le juge Dorion\u2014que l\u2019art. 1056 \u201caccorderait dans le cas de survie l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 qu\u2019il refuse dans le cas de mort\u201d.\nIl y en a d\u2019autres: 1. La prescription serait d\u2019un an contre l\u2019action de la victime (art. 2262-2 C.C.); elle serait de deux ans contre l\u2019action de l\u2019\u00e9tranger (art. 2261-2 C.C.).\n2. Si l\u2019on admet que les parents n\u2019ont droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9 que dans les cas pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 l\u2019art. 1056 C.C., le code accorderait \u00e0 n\u2019importe quel \u00e9tranger le recours g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l\u2019article 1053 C.C. et le refuserait aux parents, except\u00e9 dans les cas limit\u00e9s mentionn\u00e9s dans l\u2019article 1056 C.C.\n3. Si l\u2019on pr\u00e9tend que l\u2019art. 1056 C.C. n\u2019enl\u00e8ve pas aux parents le \u201cdroit de poursuivre\u201d, du vivant de la victime, \u00e0 quel moment cette action pourra-t-elle \u00eatre intent\u00e9e? Il est clair qu\u2019en cas de mort de la victime, les parents ne peuvent poursuivre que si elle n\u2019a pas obtenu satisfaction et indemnit\u00e9, et seulement \u201cpour les dommages r\u00e9sultant du d\u00e9c\u00e8s\u201d. Si les parents veulent intenter une action, du vivant de la victime, comment d\u00e9cidera-t-on si cette derni\u00e8re va d\u00e9c\u00e9der, ou non, \u201cen cons\u00e9quence\u201d du d\u00e9lit? Et tant que la victime n\u2019a pas intent\u00e9 sa propre action, de quelle fa\u00e7on va-t-on s\u2019y prendre pour savoir si elle mourra sans obtenir \u201cindemnit\u00e9 ou satisfaction\u201d? Et cependant comment, en vertu de l\u2019article 1056 C.C., pourrait-on accueillir l\u2019action des parents, du vivant de la victime, sans que ces conditions-l\u00e0 soient d\u00e9termin\u00e9es? A tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, si toutes les autres r\u00e9clamations de ce genre ne sont pas \u00e9limin\u00e9es tant que la victime imm\u00e9diate survit, le droit de poursuite des parents et des autres, pour leurs dommages r\u00e9sultant imm\u00e9diatement des \u201cinjures corporelles\u201d de la victime, d\u00e9pendrait uniquement de la h\u00e2te qu\u2019ils mettraient \u00e0 intenter leur action avant que la victime n\u2019en meure, puisque, apr\u00e8s sa mort, le seul droit qui subsiste est celui des plus proches parents pour r\u00e9clamer les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats r\u00e9sultant de tel d\u00e9c\u00e8s\nUne citation de Demogue, sur laquelle on s\u2019appuie, fait voir la difficult\u00e9 d\u2019appliquer la doctrine fran\u00e7aise moderne, m\u00eame en vertu d\u2019une l\u00e9gislation qui ne contient pas l\u2019art. 1056 C.C. La voici (Demogue, Trait\u00e9 des Obligations\u2014vol. 4, n\u00b0 528):\n528. S\u2019il y a eu accident de personne, l\u2019action est ouverte non seulement \u00e0 la victime mat\u00e9rielle, mais \u00e0 tous ceux qui sont atteints dans leurs droits. Ainsi une personne qui \u00e9tait le soutien de sa famille devenant incapable de travailler, une action lui est ouverte \u00e0 lui et en m\u00eame temps aux personnes qu\u2019elle soutenait.\nToutefois, il faut \u00e9viter d\u2019arriver \u00e0 prononcer ainsi une indemnit\u00e9 sup\u00e9rieure au pr\u00e9judice. Si l\u2019ouvrier qui gagnait 6,000 francs par an obtient une rente de cette somme, il n\u2019y a plus lieu d\u2019attribuer une indemnit\u00e9 \u00e0 ses proches puisqu\u2019il peut continuer \u00e0 leur payer la m\u00eame pension alimentaire. Mais le tribunal fera bien de pr\u00e9ciser qu\u2019une autre action serait irrecevable.\nAinsi, m\u00eame sous la loi fran\u00e7aise, la th\u00e9orie qu\u2019on pr\u00e9conise entra\u00eene presque n\u00e9cessairement le double emploi des indemnit\u00e9s. Il y a danger qu\u2019on accorde aux proches une indemnit\u00e9 que la \u201cvictime mat\u00e9rielle\u201d aura d\u00e9j\u00e0 re\u00e7ue. C\u2019est tellement l\u00e0 que peut conduire cette doctrine que Demogue \u00e9crit:\nMais le tribunal fera bien de pr\u00e9ciser qu\u2019une autre action serait irrecevable.\nJe n\u2019ai pas \u00e0 me demander en vertu de quel raisonnement juridique, si la th\u00e9orie est bonne, l\u2019action des proches pourrait \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9e irrecevable en pareil cas. Il me suffit de constater que les auteurs fran\u00e7ais modernes, qui pr\u00e9conisent cette th\u00e9orie, sont contraints de lui assigner des limites, m\u00eame en l\u2019absence de l\u2019article 1056 C.C. dans le code qu\u2019ils commentent. A plus forte raison doit-on conclure, en vertu de la loi du Qu\u00e9bec, que ces actions sont irrecevables du vivant de la victime et que le l\u00e9gislateur a voulu \u00e9viter ainsi les cons\u00e9quences d une interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019art. 1056 C.C. diff\u00e9rente de celle que nous soumettons.\nQu\u2019arriverait-il, dans le cas que suppose M. Demogue, si l\u2019action des proches avait anticip\u00e9 celle de la victime et s\u2019ils avaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 obtenu indemnit\u00e9? On ne saurait d\u00e9clarer irrecevable l\u2019action de la victime et, d\u00e8s lors, l\u2019auteur du d\u00e9lit serait-il appel\u00e9 \u00e0 payer double indemnit\u00e9?\nLa v\u00e9ritable solution impos\u00e9e par notre article 1056 C.C., c\u2019est que, en derni\u00e8re analyse, les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats r\u00e9sultant d\u2019 \u201cinjures corporelles\u201d appartiennent seulement \u00e0 la victime \u201ccontre qui le d\u00e9lit ou quasi-d\u00e9lit a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis\u201d, et qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de responsabilit\u00e9 vis-\u00e0-vis des autres. Ce n\u2019est que si la victime d\u00e9c\u00e8de sans avoir obtenu ces dommages, qu\u2019une responsabilit\u00e9 limit\u00e9e existe \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de certains proches mentionn\u00e9s dans l\u2019article. Ni dans l\u2019un, ni dans l\u2019autre cas, il n\u2019y a place pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\nSi l\u2019on pr\u00e9tend que l\u2019art. 1056 C.C. ne pourvoit qu\u2019au cas de mort de la victime, va-t-on ajouter que le conjoint, le p\u00e8re, la m\u00e8re ou les enfants, pourvu qu\u2019ils soient en de\u00e7\u00e0 des d\u00e9lais de prescription, pourront r\u00e9clamer \u00e0 la fois les dommages subis par eux du vivant de cette victime et les dommages r\u00e9sultant de sa mort, comme, par exemple: le temps qu\u2019ils ont consacr\u00e9 \u00e0 la soigner ou le gain qu\u2019elle a perdu et dont ils ont, en cons\u00e9quence, \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9s pendant son invalidit\u00e9 d\u2019une part; et, d\u2019autre part, la perte du soutien et des aliments r\u00e9sultant de son d\u00e9c\u00e8s? L\u2019article dit qu\u2019ils ont droit aux seuls dommages r\u00e9sultant du d\u00e9c\u00e8s. Et si leur droit est subordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 la mort de la victime et au fait qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas obtenu indemnit\u00e9, il faut bien qu\u2019ils attendent pour exercer leur action que ces deux conditions se soient produites.\nIl est d\u2019ailleurs tr\u00e8s significatif que depuis que ces deux articles sont en vigueur (1867),\u2014comme les procureurs des parties l\u2019ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9,\u2014il n\u2019y a pas d\u2019exemple d\u2019action semblable \u00e0 celle de l\u2019intim\u00e9e dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec.\nLa revue aussi compl\u00e8te que possible que nous avons pu faire des rapports judiciaires ne nous a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que l\u2019arr\u00eat de Larriv\u00e9 v. Lapierre[86] o\u00f9 il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un p\u00e8re qui r\u00e9clamait les dommages personnels qu\u2019il avait subis par suite d\u2019un accident \u00e0 son fils, qui lui remettait son salaire. Le d\u00e9fendeur avait soulev\u00e9 le point \u201cqu\u2019en loi il n\u2019y a pas en faveur du p\u00e8re ouverture \u00e0 l\u2019action qu\u2019il a intent\u00e9e\u201d. Apr\u00e8s la production de cette d\u00e9fense en droit, le demandeur a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une motion demandant qu\u2019il lui f\u00fbt permis d\u2019amender sa d\u00e9claration, en ajoutant que son fils \u00e9tait mineur.\nIl s\u2019agissait donc d\u2019un cas o\u00f9 ces m\u00eames dommages\u2014perte du salaire du fils\u2014eussent pu \u00eatre r\u00e9clam\u00e9s par le p\u00e8re comme tuteur. C\u2019est l\u00e0 peut-\u00eatre la raison pour laquelle le jugement, qui accorda ces dommages (d\u2019ailleurs au montant minime de $200), ne para\u00eet pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9 en appel.\nLe souci du l\u00e9gislateur de limiter le droit de poursuivre en mati\u00e8re d\u2019injures corporelles ne se trouve pas d\u2019ailleurs que dans le code civil. Il est \u00e9galement dans la Loi concernant les Accidents du Travail (Stat. de Que. (1928). c 79), en vertu de laquelle seuls ont un recours la victime, le conjoint survivant, les enfants, et les ascendants et descendante dont la victime \u00e9tait le principal soutien.\nOn peut tr\u00e8s raisonnablement supposer que, dans cette mati\u00e8re, le l\u00e9gislateur a voulu emp\u00eacher la possibilit\u00e9 de la multiplicit\u00e9 ou de l\u2019encha\u00eenement d\u2019actions dont parle notre coll\u00e8gue, M. le Juge Mignault, et que signalait, en semblable cas, Lord Cairns rendant jugement \u00e0 la Chambre des Lords dans la cause de Simpson v. Thomson[87], que je cite \u00e0 titre d\u2019exemple:\nThis proposition virtually affirms a principle which I think your Lordships will do well to consider with some care, as it will be found to have a much wider application and signification than any which may be involved in the incidents of a contract of insurance. The principle involved seems to me to be this\u2014that where damage is done by a wrongdoer to a chattel not only the owner of that chattel, but all those who by contract with the owner have bound themselves to obligations which are rendered more onerous, or have secured to themselves advantages which are rendered less beneficial by the damage done to the chattel have a right of action against the wrongdoer although they have no immediate or reversionary property in the chattel, and no possessory right by reason of any contract attaching to the chattel itself, such as by lien or hypothecation.\nThis, I say, is the principle involved in the Respondents\u2019 contention. If it be a sound one, it would seem to follow that if, by the negligence of a wrongdoer, goods are destroyed which the owner of them had bound himself by contract to supply to a third person, this person as well as the owner has a right of action for any loss inflicted on him by their destruction.\nBut if this be true as to injuries done to chattels, it would seem to be equally so as to injuries to the person. An individual injured by a negligently driven carriage has an action against the owner of it. Would a doctor, it may be asked, who had contracted to attend him and provide medicines for a fixed sum by the year, also have a right of action in respect of the additional cost of attendance and medicine cast upon him by that accident? And yet it cannot be denied that the doctor had an interest in his patient\u2019s safety. In like manner an actor or singer bound for a term to a manager of a theatre is disabled by the wrongful act of a third person to the serious loss of the manager. Can the manager recover damages for that loss from the wrongdoer? Such instances might be indefinitely multiplied, giving rise to rights of action which in modern communities, where every complexity of mutual relation is daily created by contract, might be both numerous and novel.\nMy Lords, I have given these illustrations because I fail to see any distinction in principle between them and the right asserted by the underwriters in the present case; and if I am right in so regarding them, they shew at least how much would be involved in a decision by your Lordship? where by that right should be affirmed.\nDe ce passage on pourrait rapprocher ce que dit notre coll\u00e8gue, M. le juge Duff, rendant le jugement du Conseil priv\u00e9 dans la cause de McColl v. Canadian Pacific Ry. Co.[88].\nQuoi qu\u2019il en soit, pour les raisons que j\u2019ai donn\u00e9es au cours de ce jugement, je suis d\u2019avis que les r\u00e9clamations faites par l\u2019intim\u00e9e et pour lesquelles on lui a accord\u00e9 une indemnit\u00e9 ne repr\u00e9sentent pas des dommages subis par l\u2019intim\u00e9e, mais plut\u00f4t des dommages soufferts par le fr\u00e8re Henri-Gabriel. Quant aux frais de m\u00e9decin et d\u2019h\u00f4pitaux, ce sont ceux du fr\u00e8re Henri-Gabriel et non pas ceux de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\nQuant aux autres dommages r\u00e9clam\u00e9s, d\u2019apr\u00e8s leur v\u00e9ritable caract\u00e8re, ils ne repr\u00e9sentent pas une perte pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e, mais une perte pour le fr\u00e8re Henri-Gabriel r\u00e9sultant de son incapacit\u00e9. Par surcro\u00eet, ils sont indirects et sont trop \u00e9loign\u00e9s (arts. 1074 et 1075 C.C.).\nJe r\u00e9p\u00e8te que je concours avec M. le juge Mignault pour faire droit \u00e0 l\u2019appel et rejeter l\u2019action avec d\u00e9pens.\nLamont J.\u2014In this case I will briefly state the conclusions at which I have arrived. The facts and circumstances as disclosed by the evidence have been set out in the judgments of my learned brothers and need not be repeated here.\nTwo questions are involved in this appeal: (1) Did a right of action against the appellant (defendant) accrue to the respondent (plaintiff) by reason of the injuries received by Brother Henri-Gabriel? and (2) If so, was the respondent\u2019s claim barred at the time it commenced these proceedings?\nThe point really involved in the first of these questions, which is one of considerable practical importance, is this: Does art. 1053 C.C., on its true construction, when read with art. 1056 C.C., limit the right of action therein provided for to the immediate victim of the fault, or does it give a right of action to any one who, although not the immediate victim, has suffered damage as a direct result of that fault?\nArts. 1053 to 1056 of the Civil Code embody practically the whole law of the province of Quebec relating to the subject of torts. On their construction therefore depend the rights of a person against whom a wrong has been committed whether the wrong was committed against his person, honour, or reputation.\nArts. 1053 and 1056 C.C. read as follows:\n1053. Every person capable of discerning right from wrong is responsible for the damage caused by his fault to another, whether by positive act, imprudence, neglect or want of skill.\n1056. In all cases where the person injured by the commission of an offence or a quasi-offence dies in consequence, without having obtained indemnity or satisfaction, his consort and his ascendant and descendant relations have a right, but only within a year after his death, to recover from the person who committed the offence or quasi-offence, or his representatives, all damages occasioned by his death.\nIn the case of a duel, action may be brought in like manner not only against the immediate author of the death, but also against all those who took part in the duel, whether as seconds or as witnesses.\nIn all cases no more than one action can be brought on behalf of those who are entitled to the indemnity and the judgment determines the proportion of such indemnity which each is to receive.\nThese actions are independent and do not prejudice the criminal proceedings to which the parties may be subject.\nIn construing these articles w\u00e9 must bear in mind two rules of interpretation. The first is that laid down by the Privy Council in Quebec Railway L.H. & P. Co. v. Vandry[89]. The head-note of that case states the rule, which is as follows:\nThe Civil Code of Quebec should be interpreted in the first instance solely according to the words used, the Code, or at least cognate articles, being read as a whole forming a complete scheme. It is only if the meaning is not plain that light should be sought from exterior sources, such as decisions in Quebec earlier than the Code, or the exposition of similar articles of the Code Napol\u00e9on.\nSee also the judgment of Lord Herschell in Bank of England v. Vagliano[90].\nThe other rule applicable is the well-known rule of interpretation of statutes, namely, that we are to construe legislative provisions according to the ordinary sense of the words unless such construction would lead to some unreasonable result or be inconsistent with, or contrary to, the declared intention of the framers of the law, in which case the grammatical sense of the words may be extended or modified.\nArt. 1053 C.C. in so many words declares that everyone capable of discerning right from wrong is responsible for the damage caused by his fault to another. The word \u201canother\u201d (autrui) in its ordinary signification is a word of very wide import. It is, unless restricted by the context, wide enough to include not only the immediate victim of the fault but also all those who have suffered damage as the direct result of that fault. Taken by itself there is nothing in the language of art. 1053 C.C. which would indicate a legislative intention of limiting the liability, for fault causing damage, to the immediate victim of such fault only. The wording of the section clearly gives a right of action for indemnity to every person to whom the fault caused damage. This view has found support in a number of judicial decisions in the province of Quebec: Larriv\u00e9 v. Lapierre (1); Paquin v. Grand Trunk Ry. Co. (2).\nIt is contended, however, that arts. 1053 and 1056 C.C. must be read together and that as the \u201cperson injured by the commission of the offence or quasi-offence\u201d in art. 1056 C.C. is clearly limited to the immediate victim, the same restrictive meaning should be given to the person who suffered damage by the fault of another within the meaning of art. 1053 C.C. That these two articles should be read together is clear. When read together, however, what are the rights which they have secured, and th\u00e8 obligations which they have imposed? Art. 1053 C.C. deals generally with the rights of persons who have suffered damage when that damage was caused by the fault of another person who was capable of discerning right from wrong. It provides for the enforcement of those rights by imposing liability on the one guilty of the fault. To be entitled, therefore, to maintain an action under this article against a defendant capable of discerning right from wrong (and liability is imposed only upon such a defendant) the plaintiff must establish[91] that he has suffered damage, and[92] that such damage was caused by the fault of the defendant. Art. 1056 C.C. does not in any way deal with these general rights and has no application unless and until the\nperson injured by the commission of an offence or a quasi-offence dies in consequence, without having obtained indemnity or satisfaction.\nWhen that situation arises art. 1056 C.C. becomes operative and determines who may sue; the cause of action upon which, and the time within which, suit may be brought; and, by declaring that only one action shall be brought on behalf of all those who are entitled to indemnity, it limits the right of action for damage, occasioned by the death, to those relatives mentioned in the article. In the case of a duel resulting in the death of one of the parties thereto, a similar action may be brought against the author of the death and against all those who took part in the duel whether as seconds or witnesses. Art. 1056 C.C. was designed to give special rights and to impose special obligations in those cases in which the fault caused the death of the immediate victim. That, in my opinion, is the effect, and the whole effect, of that article. It limits, it is true, the effect which art. 1053 C.C. otherwise would have, but the limitation it imposes is a limitation of the field within which art. 1053 C.C. would otherwise operate by excluding therefrom all cases in which the commission of the offence or quasi-offence is followed by the death of the person injured as a consequence thereof, before such person has obtained indemnity or satsifaction. In France under the Code Napol\u00e9on the rights of those damnified by the death of the immediate victim of the fault are governed by the general law which corresponds to our art. 1053 C.C., while in the province of Quebec these rights have been given special and exclusive treatment by art. 1056 C.C. The language of the first part of the latter article is descriptive of the circumstances required to bring the article into operation, but beyond that I cannot see that it has any bearing on the problem before us.\nWith deference, therefore, to those who take the opposite view, I am of opinion that there is nothing in the context of these articles to limit the meaning which the word \u201canother\u201d in art. 1053 C.C. would ordinarily bear, or restrict its meaning to the immediate victim of the fault.\nThere being nothing in the articles referred to which would deprive the respondent of its right to sue, it is necessary to see if the articles relating to prescription had barred the respondent\u2019s claim before this action was brought. The pertinent articles read as follows:\n2242. All things, rights and actions the prescription of which is not otherwise regulated by law, are prescribed by thirty years, without the party prescribing being bound to produce any title, and notwithstanding any exception pleading bad faith. 2261. The following actions are prescribed by two years:\n* * *\n2. For damages, resulting from offences or quasi-offences, whenever other provisions do not apply;\n2262. The following actions are prescribed by one year:\n* * *\n2. For bodily injuries, saving the special provisions contained in article 1056 and cases regulated by special laws.\nThe prescriptive period in arts. 2261 (2) and 2262 (2) C.C. being exceptions to the general rule are to be strictly construed. This is stated in Mignault\u2019s \u201cDroit Civil Canadien,\u201d vol. 9, page 518, in the following language:\nLa prescription courte est une prescription d\u2019exception, elle n\u2019existe que lorsqu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 express\u00e9ment d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9e par le l\u00e9gislateur.\nIn order to determine within which of these articles relating to prescription the respondent\u2019s claim falls it is necessary to inquire just what it is that is claimed and the ground upon which the claim is based. As I read the statement of claim the respondent claims to be entitled in its own right to recover damages which it alleges it has suffered and which were caused by the fault of the appellant These damages are claimed under three headings:\n(1) Sums disbursed for medical treatment and attention in an effort to relieve the sufferings and bring about the recovery of Brother Henri-Gabriel. (2) $118 damage done to the clothes that the injured brother had on, and the effects he had with him at the time of the accident. (3) For loss of his services. Such a claim, in my opinion, is a claim for damages resulting from a quasi-offence and is based upon art. 1053 C.C. The prescriptive period of the action would, therefore, be two years, unless some other provision applies. It was contended that art. 2262 (2) C.C. applies and that this is really an action for bodily injuries and, as the action was not begun for almost two years after the accident occurred, the respondent\u2019s right of action was prescribed before the action was brought. An action for bodily injuries, in my opinion, implies, prima facie at least, that the action is brought, by one who has suffered injury to his person, to recover compensation therefor and indemnity for the loss resulting therefrom. It was however argued that the saving clause in art. 2262 (2) C.C. shewed that the term \u201cbodily injuries\u201d must be given a wider construction in that article, as, in view of that clause, an action under art. 1056 C.C. would impliedly be an action for bodily injuries, although the persons for whose benefit the action was brought had not suffered any injuries to their persons. Whether upon a true construction of art. 1056 C.C., an action brought thereunder would be held to be an action for bodily injury, we need not inquire, for, even if it were, that construction would apply only where the statute expressly so provided and would not be extended by analogy to actions under art. 1053 C.C. and thus cut down the time within which an action under that article might be brought. In this case the respondent who brought the action being a corporation could not, and did not, receive any bodily injury. If, therefore, it had a right of action in its own right\u2014and I think it had\u2014it is difficult to see how that action can be said to be for bodily injuries. An action to recover for the damage done to a suit of clothes is clearly an action for damage to property. So also is an action for loss of services. In Clerk & Lindsell on Torts, 8th ed., at p. 201, the learned author says:\nWhere the relation of master and servant exists the right which the one has to the service of the other is regarded by the law as a species of property or interest, a wrongful infringement of which causing actual damage is a good cause of action.\nSo far, therefore, as these two claims are concerned the action cannot be said to be an action for bodily injuries.\nA more plausible argument may be made for the moneys paid out for medical treatment. Had the injured brother brought an action for compensation for the injuries he received, and had he claimed therein for medical treatment the sums claimed under that heading in this action, he would, in my opinion, provided he had made himself liable for those sums, be entitled to recover them in his action for personal injuries. But that would be because the treatment, and therefore the payments made on account thereof, would be the natural and probable consequence of the injuries received, and would be incidental thereto. Here, however, the action is for those claims only which would be incidental to an action for bodily injuries. To those claims the respondent could not add a claim for bodily injuries, since it has not received any such injuries. In my opinion art. 2262 (2) C.C. has no application to the present case. The respondent\u2019s claim was, therefore, not prescribed when it brought its action. There remains only to ascertain if the evidence established that the respondent suffered the damage claimed and if such damage was occasioned by the fault of the appellant. I will consider the items in the order above mentioned.\n(1) That the respondent paid out the sum of $2,236.90 for medical treatment and attention in an effort to alleviate the sufferings of Brother Henri-Gabriel is not disputed. Was that expenditure caused by the default of the defendant?\nThe word \u201ccaused\u201d as used in art. 1053 C.C. means \u201cbrought about,\u201d \u201cthat from which something proceeded.\u201d The word, in my opinion, implies not merely that the fault is a sine qua non of the damage, but that it is the causa causans\u2014the efficient cause thereof.\nThe fault of which the appellant was guilty was negligence on the part of its servant for which, under art. 1054 C.C., it is responsible. That negligence caused an explosion of gasoline which very severely injured Brother Henri-Gabriel. That injury, in my opinion, rendered necessary expenditures for his relief which would not otherwise have been made. The injury and the expenditures may therefore be considered as cause and effect. For this reason I agree with the unanimous view of the court below affirming the judgment of the Superior Court that these expenditures were caused by the fault of the appellant and that the appellant is liable therefor.\n(2) The $118 claimed as damage done to the clothes and effects of Brother Henri-Gabriel were not, as I read the judgments, allowed either by the Superior Court or the Court of King\u2019s Bench. In my opinion this item was properly disallowed. The clothes and effects were given to the brother by the respondent in recognition of his services to the congregation and the relationship existing between them, and there is no evidence of any intention on the respondent\u2019s part to retain any property in them. Had the brother himself sued for the damage claimed in this item, he could, in my opinion, have recovered on the ground that the articles were his own.\n(3) As to the claim for loss of services. This is a well-established form of action. If the relationship of master and servant existed between the respondent and Brother Henri-Gabriel, the respondent should recover on this claim, for it is a tort actionable at the suit of the master to so injure the servant that the master is deprived of the servant\u2019s services. Martinez v. Gerber[93]. To be entitled to maintain an action for loss of services a legal right to such services, and the loss thereof, must be established. In Admiralty Commissioners v. SS. Amerika[94], Lord Sumner said:\nIt is the loss of service which is the gist of the action, and loss of service depends upon the right to the service, and that depends upon the contract between the master and the servant.\nIn 20 Halsibury, p. 276, the law is stated as follows:\n688. The right of the master being based upon loss of service, it is necessary for him to prove the existence of a valid contract of service, though he need not show that the servant was hired at wages or at a salary.\nIn some cases, however, it is sufficient for the master to shew a de facto service, that is service rendered in fact but not under any binding contract. In an action for loss of the services and society of his wife of which he had been deprived by the wrongful act of the defendant, it is sufficient if the husband establishes loss of service. And the same applies to a father who brings an action for loss of the services of a child living with him and under age who is not under a binding contract to serve another exclusively. That, however, is because the law recognizes that the husband has a legal right to the services of his wife and the father a legal right to the services of his child. But, where no legal right to the services of another is presumed by law from the relationship of the parties, the existence of a valid contract must be established.\nThe relationship existing between the respondent and Brother Henri-Gabriel was not that of the family tie. It arose from the fact that the brother joined the congregation and took the vows of perpetuity and stability. Joining the congregation rendered him subject to its constitution, of which art. 48 reads as follows:\nLes produits des travaux des Fr\u00e8res et les dons qui leur seraient faits comme religieux, de quelque part qu\u2019ils viennent et de quelque nature qu\u2019ils soient, appartiennent \u00e0 l\u2019Institut et doivent retourner uniquement \u00e0 son profit.\nBy his, vows the brother engaged himself to remain with the congregation for the rest of his life, and to maintain its object, spirit and constitution. On its part the congregation considered that the obligation of maintaining him devolved upon it. In his evidence Fr\u00e8re Gabriel-Marie testified as follows:\nQ. Les v\u0153ux perp\u00e9tuels et les v\u0153ux de stabilit\u00e9 sont bien ceux qu\u2019a d\u00e9finis le Fr\u00e8re Garvaisius?\nR. Parfaitement.\nQ. De sorte que le fr\u00e8re est irr\u00e9vocablement \u00e0 voire charge?\nR. Oui. Devant Rome, nous ne pouvons absolument renvoyer le sujet, ni le laisser \u00e0 sa propre charge, il est \u00e0 notre charge, il est \u00e0 notre charge pour toujours.\nBrother Henri-Gabriel performed his vows for many-years and worked faithfully as a member of the congregation, and, but for his accident, would doubtless have continued to do so. The question, however, is: Can it reasonably be inferred from the fact of the brother\u2019s joining the congregation and taking the vows and from the congregation\u2019s recognition of its obligation to maintain him, that the parties intended to create, and did create, the contractual relation of master and servant? I am very clearly of opinion that such never was the intention of either of the parties, nor did they effectuate such a result. I am unable to see anything in the evidence which justifies the conclusion that either the brother or the congregation ever considered they were creating a legal relationship between them. The obligations undertaken were, no doubt, considered as binding on the conscience, but the vows were not taken by the brother in consideration of any agreement on the part of the congregation to maintain him, nor was the obligation of maintenance incurred in consideration of the vows. The attitude of both parties, as disclosed by their acts and the nature of the transaction, seems to me to repel any idea on the part of either of creating contractual obligations. So far as I can see Brother Henri-Gabriel might legally have ceased at any time to give his services to the congregation. As the legal relation of master and servant was not created, and as the respondent did not obtain a legal right to the services of the brother the respondent cannot succeed on this item; for it cannot be said that the fault of the appellant has deprived the respondent of the brother\u2019s services when, in fact, the respondent never had any legal right to those services.\nCounsel for the respondent called our attention to certain decisions of French tribunals and certain opinions of French text writers which indicated that, under an article in the Code Napol\u00e9on similar to our art. 1053 C.C., it was not necessary to establish a contractual relationship to be entitled to recover for loss of services. In the Vandry case (1), the Privy Council, in addition to the rule quoted above, said, at p. 671:\nhowever stimulating and suggestive the reasoning of French Courts or French jurists upon kindred subject and not dissimilar texts undoubtedly is, \u201crecent French decisions, though entitled to the highest respect... are not binding authority in Quebec\u201d (McArthur v. Dominion Cartridge Co. (1905) A.C. 72, 77) still less can they prevail to alter or control what is and always must be remembered to be the language of a Legislature established within the British Empire.\nUnder art. 1053 C.C., the legislature has imposed liability where the damage suffered was caused by the fault. It is a question of causation. The right to service gives the master a property in the labour of his servant. Smith\u2019s Law of Master and Servant, p. 86.\nIn the present case the respondent did not suffer the damage claimed unless he had a property in the brother\u2019s services. For the reasons I have given I think it had not. It had, therefore, nothing of which it could be deprived.\nThe appeal, therefore, should be dismissed as to the $2,236 awarded for medical treatment and attention, and allowed as to the claim for damage for loss of services.\nI would not allow any costs of appeal.\nSmith J.\u2014I concur with the Chief Justice.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Elliott & David.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Cartier & Barcelo.\n[1] (1928) Q.O.R. 46 K.B. 96.\n[2] Q.O.R. 46 K.B. 96.\n2 Q.O.R. 46 K.B. 96.\n[3] (1887) 14 Can.

Ernest Lefaivre (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1929: February 19. 1929: May 27.\nPresent: Duff, Mignault, Newcombe, Rinfret and Smith JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING\u2019S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nWorkmen\u2019s Compensation Act\u2014Insurance company\u2014Indemnity policy\u2014Minimum and estimated premiums mentioned in the policy\u2014Supplementary premium fixed and payable after the expiry of policy\u2014Accident to employee during life of the policy\u2014Notice to insurer after supplementary premium is due\u2014Liability of the insurance company\u2014Insolvency of the employer\u2014Fyling of claim with the trustee for supplementary premium\u2014Compensation between premium and indemnity.\nThe appellant company insured one Dub\u00e9 under an indemnity policy against liabilities resulting from the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act for a period of one year from the 26th of January, 1924. The premium was based upon the whole remuneration of the insured\u2019s employees during the period of the policy as follows: a \u201cminimum\u201d premium and an \u201cestimated premium\u201d were stipulated to be paid, and were in fact paid, in advance by the employer, and, at the expiry of the policy, an adjustment was to be made so that a supplementary premium may then be due by the insured or a reimbursement may be made by the company, according to the amount of wages paid by the insured during the life of the policy; but, in any case, the \u201cminimum\u201d premium was to be retained by the company. On the 2nd of August, 1924, an employee of Dub\u00e9, one L\u00e9vesque, was injured, but a petition to sue the employer under the Act was served only on the 28th of January, 1925, and, on the same day, Dub\u00e9 made an assignment in bankruptcy. L\u00e9vesque, having been granted permission to sue the trustee, one Gagnon, obtained judgment for $5,300 and costs against the present respondent who had succeeded Gagnon as trustee. On the 27th of January, 1925, one day after the expiry of the policy and one day prior to the service of the petition on Dub\u00e9, an adjustment had been made as provided for in the policy and a supplementary premium of $1,020.58 was thereby shown to be due by Dub\u00e9. On the 22nd of January, 1927, the respondent sued the appellant company for the payment of $6,490, being L\u00e9vesque\u2019s claim of $5,300 and the costs, under the judgment secured against the respondent which he had not yet paid. The appellant company repudiated its liability on the ground that the supplementary premium of $1,020.58 had not been paid by the insured.\nHeld, Mignault J. dissenting, that the appellant company was liable for the amount claimed by the respondent. Under the terms of the policy, the obligations of each party were not simultaneous and that of the insurer to indemnify was not made subject to the obligation of the insured to pay the supplementary premium. The appellant\u2019s liability was complete and absolute on the date of the accident, i.e., on the 2nd of August, 1924; on that day, the appellant, having received all the premiums then due, became bound to pay to the employer the amount of the indemnity to be awarded to the injured employee under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act.\nHeld, also, that, at all events, the company could not repudiate the claim while it asserted its right to keep the premiums already paid and also while it persisted in maintaining a claim, filed with the trustee in bankruptcy, for the supplementary premium.\nHeld, also, that the supplementary premium may not be deducted from the indemnity on the ground of compensation, as at no time, before the bankruptcy, were they equally liquidated and demandable.\nPer Mignault J. (dissenting).\u2014The appellant company had a right to oppose the respondent\u2019s action with a plea of non adimpleti contractus, i.e., to ask that its liability to pay the amount claimed should be postponed until the payment by the insured of the supplementary premium. A right of action against the insurer does not exist in favour of the employer until the injured employee has filed his claim for compensation. On the date of the service by L\u00e9vesque of his petition to sue Dub\u00e9, the supplementary premium of $1,020.58 was due and unpaid by the latter and, therefore, the insurance company was not liable. It is not the accident itself, but the notice of the accident to the insurer, which creates against the latter an obligation to pay under the policy.\nJudgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Q.O.R. 45 K.B. 224) aff., Mignault J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, Stein J., and maintaining the respondent\u2019s action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nGustave Monette for the appellant.\nP. E. Gagnon K.C for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the Court (Duff, Newcombe, Rinfret and Smith JJ.) was delivered by Rinfret, J\u2014Duncan N. Dub\u00e9, un industriel d\u2019Amqui, province de Qu\u00e9bec, avait pris une police d\u2019assurance de la compagnie appelante contre tous les accidents du travail qui se produiraient dans son usine depuis le 26 janvier 1924 jusqu\u2019au 26 janvier 1925.\nLe 2 ao\u00fbt 1924\u2014par cons\u00e9quent, pendant la p\u00e9riode de temps couverte par la police et alors que cette police \u00e9tait en vigueur\u2014un ouvrier du nom de L\u00e9vesque fut bless\u00e9 dans l\u2019usine de Dub\u00e9. Il fit, le 28 janvier 1925, signifier une requ\u00eate pour \u00eatre autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 assigner Dub\u00e9 en recouvrement d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 en vertu de la loi des accidents du travail; mais le m\u00eame jour Dub\u00e9 faisait cession de ses biens.\nJ.-P.-N. Gagnon fut d\u2019abord nomm\u00e9 syndic \u00e0 la faillite de Dub\u00e9; puis, Gagnon \u00e9tant d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9, il fut remplac\u00e9 par Lefaivre, le pr\u00e9sent d\u00e9fendeur-intim\u00e9.\nL\u00e9vesque avait re\u00e7u la permission de poursuivre sa r\u00e9clamation contre Gagnon en sa qualit\u00e9 de syndic de Dub\u00e9, et il avait obtenu un jugement,\u2014ex parte d\u2019abord, puis \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une contestation par voie d\u2019opposition \u00e0 jugement, \u2014pour la somme de $5,300 et les frais. La mort de Gagnon \u00e9tait survenue pendant cette derni\u00e8re contestation, et c\u2019es, son successeur, avait repris l\u2019instance.\nCe jugement d\u00e9finitif en faveur de L\u00e9vesque fut rendu le 8 mars 1926, et un bref d\u2019ex\u00e9cution en satisfaction de ce jugement fut m\u00eame \u00e9mis contre le syndic le 20 avril de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e. Il n\u2019appara\u00eet cependant nulle part qu\u2019une saisie ait \u00e9t\u00e9 pratiqu\u00e9e et nous n\u2019avons au dossier aucun rapport du sh\u00e9rif ou d\u2019un huissier \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\nLes proc\u00e9dures prises par L\u00e9vesque ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9es \u00e0 la connaissance de la compagnie d\u2019assurance, elle refusa de s\u2019en occuper, et encore plus de prendre le fait et cause du failli Dub\u00e9, en objectant que la prime totale qui \u00e9tait due en vertu de la police d\u2019assurance n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9e, soit par Dub\u00e9, soit par le syndic \u00e0 sa faillite. Nous serons amen\u00e9s par la suite \u00e0 expliquer et \u00e0 examiner cette objection davantage. Pour cette m\u00eame raison, la compagnie d\u2019assurance ne voulut pas payer la somme adjug\u00e9e en faveur de L\u00e9vesque; et le syndic Lefaivre poursuivit alors la compagnie en recouvrement de cette somme en capital, int\u00e9r\u00eats et frais. La compagnie, par sa d\u00e9fense, r\u00e9it\u00e9ra son refus de payer pour les motifs d\u00e9j\u00e0 expos\u00e9s. La Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et la Cour du Banc du Roi[2] ont maintenu l\u2019action du syndic. M. le juge Tellier, toutefois, \u00e9tait favorable \u00e0 l\u2019id\u00e9e de permettre \u00e0 la compagnie de d\u00e9duire le montant de la balance de prime rest\u00e9e impay\u00e9e.\nPour d\u00e9cider si nous devons confirmer ces jugements, il nous faut premi\u00e8rement analyser la police d\u2019assurance sur laquelle est bas\u00e9e la poursuite.\nOn y voit que, de la part de la compagnie appelante, il s\u2019agit d\u2019un engagement envers le patron. C\u2019est avec Dub\u00e9 qu\u2019elle a contract\u00e9 et c\u2019est vis-\u00e0-vis de Dub\u00e9 qu\u2019elle a assum\u00e9 des obligations \u201cen ce qui concerne\u201d, dit la police, les blessures corporelles, y compris la mort qui en est la cons\u00e9quence, souffertes par les employ\u00e9s dudit patron.\nCes obligations sont:\n(a) de payer \u201c\u00e0 toute personne qui y aura droit en vertu de la Loi des Accidents du Travail, promptement et de la mani\u00e8re y pourvue, le montant payable en entier ou les versements au fur et \u00e0 mesure qu\u2019ils seront payables, etc.\u201d\nDub\u00e9 ou son syndic Lefaivre pouvait donc demander, par l\u2019action, que la compagnie f\u00fbt condamn\u00e9e \u00e0 payer \u00e0 L\u00e9vesque lui-m\u00eame le montant qui est pr\u00e9sentement r\u00e9clam\u00e9.\n(b) de \u201cd\u00e9dommager ledit patron des pertes subies \u00e0 cause de la responsabilit\u00e9 qui lui est impos\u00e9e par la loi pour les dommages r\u00e9sultant de telles blessures souffertes par ceux desdits employ\u00e9s qui sont l\u00e9galement employ\u00e9s, quel que soit le local o\u00f9 elles sont souffertes, pourvu que ce soit en dedans des limites territoriales de la Puissance du Canada ou des Etats-Unis d\u2019Am\u00e9rique.\u201d\nDub\u00e9 ou son syndic pouvait donc demander que l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 f\u00fbt pay\u00e9e directement \u00e0 eux par la compagnie d\u2019assurance. Cette clause n\u2019exige pas qu\u2019ils aient pr\u00e9alablement pay\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque. On peut m\u00eame ajouter que ce paiement pr\u00e9alable est l\u2019une des choses contre lesquelles Dub\u00e9 s\u2019assure. Il suffit que la \u201cperte\u201d ait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u201csubie\u201d, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire que la dette envers L\u00e9vesque ait \u00e9t\u00e9 encourue. Une dette est une diminution de l\u2019actif. Encourir une dette c\u2019est subir une perte. De plus, en vertu de la clause E des conventions, Dub\u00e9 a le droit de poursuivre pour obtenir ce d\u00e9dommagement pourvu que\nle montant de la r\u00e9clamation ou de la perte soit fix\u00e9 ou liquid\u00e9 par un jugement final rendu contre ledit patron apr\u00e8s l\u2019audition de la cause (i.e. de l\u2019action intent\u00e9e par l\u2019employ\u00e9 contre le patron) ou par un r\u00e8glement entre les parties auquel la corporation aura donn\u00e9 son consentement par \u00e9crit. On remarquera que cette clause assimile la \u201cr\u00e9clamation\u201d de l\u2019employ\u00e9 \u00e0 la \u201cperte\u201d du patron et n\u2019exige pas le paiement pr\u00e9alable de la r\u00e9clamation par le patron.\nIl faut donc d\u00e9cider que l\u2019appelante \u00e9tait d\u00e8s lors tenue de payer, \u00e0 moins que nous ne trouvions dans la suite de la police une condition qui vienne modifier cette convention principale. Par son texte, cette police se distingue de celle qui fut interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e par cette cour dans la cause de Melukhova v. The Employers\u2019 Liability-Assurance Corporation[3] et pr\u00e9sente plut\u00f4t de l\u2019analogie avec celle de North American Accident Insurance Company v. Newton[4].\nCette condition qui modifierait son obligation de garantir et de payer Dub\u00e9, l\u2019appelante nous invite \u00e0 la trouver dans la stipulation relative au paiement de la prime. Cette clause est la suivante:\nA.\u2014La prime est bas\u00e9e sur la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration totale gagn\u00e9e pendant la p\u00e9riode de la police par tous les employ\u00e9s dudit patron engag\u00e9s dans les op\u00e9rations industrielles d\u00e9crites dans lesdites d\u00e9clarations, et dans celles qui y sont n\u00e9cessaires, incidentes ou accessoires, localis\u00e9es dans lesdites usines, ateliers ou chantier ou tout autre local en rapport avec eux; avec l\u2019exception, toutefois, de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration du pr\u00e9sident, du vice-president, du secr\u00e9taire et du tr\u00e9sorier dudit patron, si celui-ci est une corporation, \u00e0 moins que cesdits officiers ne remplissent les devoirs de surintendant, de contrema\u00eetre ou d\u2019ouvrie r. Si des op\u00e9rations telles que ci-dessus d\u00e9finies sont entreprises par ledit patron et ne sont pas d\u00e9crites ni fix\u00e9es quant aux taux dans lesdites d\u00e9clarations, le patron consent \u00e0 en payer la prime, au moment de l\u2019ajustement d\u00e9finitif, d\u2019apr\u00e8s la condition \u201cC\u201d ci-apr\u00e8s \u00e9nonc\u00e9e, au taux du \u201cManuel de Taux\u201d, employ\u00e9 par la corporation au moment de l\u2019\u00e9mission de cette police, et selon les r\u00e8glements y contenus. La p\u00e9riode de la police termin\u00e9e, le montant effectif de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration gagn\u00e9e par les employ\u00e9s pendant cette p\u00e9riode sera exhib\u00e9 \u00e0 la corporation selon la condition \u201cC\u201d ci-dessous, et la prime acquise sera ajust\u00e9e proportionnellement, d\u2019apr\u00e8s ce montant, aux conditions et aux taux ici \u00e9nonc\u00e9s. Si la prime acquise, ainsi calcul\u00e9e, d\u00e9passe la prime pay\u00e9e d\u2019avance, le patron paiera imm\u00e9diatement \u00e0 la corporation le montant additionnel; si elle est moindre, la corporation rendra au patron la partie non acquise; mais en tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement la corporation retiendra le montant de la prime minimum mentionn\u00e9e dans lesdites d\u00e9clarations. Toute prime pourvue par cette police ou par un suppl\u00e9ment y annex\u00e9, sera consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme effectivement acquise, m\u00eame dans le cas o\u00f9 la Loi des Accidents du Travail serait d\u00e9clar\u00e9e invalide ou inconstitutionnelle, en tout ou en partie.\nAu moment de l\u2019\u00e9mission de la police, Dub\u00e9 a donc pay\u00e9 la prime alors convenue. Moyennant cette prime, qu\u2019elle a accept\u00e9e, la compagnie a pris les engagements que nous venons de voir. Et la clause A stipule que la p\u00e9riode de la police termin\u00e9e * * * la prime acquise sera ajust\u00e9e proportionnellement d\u2019apr\u00e8s * * * le montant effectif de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration gagn\u00e9e par les employ\u00e9s durant cette p\u00e9riode.\nCet ajustement a eu lieu. Il a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que la compagnie avait droit \u00e0 une prime suppl\u00e9mentaire. Ce suppl\u00e9ment n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 par Dub\u00e9 et, comme cons\u00e9quence, la compagnie refuse maintenant de remplir son obligation d\u2019indemniser Dub\u00e9 pour l\u2019accident de L\u00e9vesque et demande le renvoi de l\u2019action. Nous comprenons qu\u2019elle pr\u00e9sente son argument sous la forme de l\u2019exception non adimpleti contractus et qu\u2019elle affirme son droit au paiement int\u00e9gral de la prime suppl\u00e9mentaire avant d\u2019\u00eatre appel\u00e9e \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter ses obligations en vertu du contrat d\u2019assurance.\nNulle part notre code civil n\u2019a pos\u00e9 le principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral sanctionn\u00e9 par cette exception du droit romain. La Cour du Banc du Roi a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019avis qu\u2019\u00e0 tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement il n\u2019y avait pas lieu \u00e0 son application \u00e0 l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Le contrat y aurait pourvu dans les circonstances sp\u00e9ciales de cette cause. Si la compagnie n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9e par Dub\u00e9, et si elle ne l\u2019a pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 par le syndic, si m\u00eame elle risque de ne pas \u00eatre enti\u00e8rement pay\u00e9e, c\u2019est \u00e0 cause de la banqueroute de Dub\u00e9. Or, le contrat stipule:\nEn cas de la banqueroute ou de la faillite dudit patron, la corporation ne sera pas relev\u00e9e de l\u2019obligation de payer l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 qui serait autrement payable en vertu de cette police.\nM. le juge Rivard, parlant au nom de la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du Banc du Roi, a interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 cette clause comme voulant dire que, nonobstant l\u2019inaccomplissement des obligations de l\u2019assur\u00e9, et, en particulier, nonobstant son d\u00e9faut de payer la prime suppl\u00e9mentaire comme cons\u00e9quence de sa banqueroute ou de sa faillite, la compagnie d\u2019assurance serait quand m\u00eame tenue de payer l\u2019indemnit\u00e9. C\u2019est donc pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment contre l\u2019exception que l\u2019appelante veut maintenant invoquer que le contrat aurait stipul\u00e9, dans le cas o\u00f9 surviendrait la banqueroute de l\u2019assur\u00e9. Il serait impossible d\u2019assigner un autre but \u00e0 cette clause de la police; et sans cela, elle n\u2019aurait aucun sens. En effet, la banqueroute ou la faillite ne pouvait pas d\u2019elle-m\u00eame mettre fin aux engagements de la compagnie. La raison d\u2019\u00eatre de cette stipulation serait donc de pourvoir contre le cas o\u00f9 la banqueroute emp\u00eacherait l\u2019assur\u00e9 de payer la prime additionnelle. Nous sentons toute la force de cet argument et nous nous serions rang\u00e9s de son c\u00f4t\u00e9, s\u2019il ne nous paraissait pas faire abstraction, dans la clause en question, du membre de phrase: \u201cqui serait autrement payable en vertu de la police\u201d.\nSuivant nous, ces derniers mots ont l\u2019effet de restreindre la port\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la clause. La banqueroute ou la faillite ne doit pas emp\u00eacher l\u2019effet de la police d\u2019assurance pourvu que, ind\u00e9pendamment de cette banqueroute ou de cette faillite, elle soit \u201cautrement\u201d en vigueur; et l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 sera quand m\u00eame payable, si, par ailleurs, la police est en r\u00e8gle. Si elle n\u2019est pas \u201cautrement\u201d en r\u00e8gle, l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 ne sera pas payable. Et le but de cette stipulation s\u2019explique par la suite de la clause, qui doit se lire avec elle. Pour le d\u00e9montrer, nous allons reproduire toute la clause:\nEn cas de la banqueroute ou de la faillite dudit patron, la corporation ne sera pas relev\u00e9e de l\u2019obligation de payer l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 qui serait autrement payable en vertu de cette police. Dans le cas o\u00f9, \u00e0 cause de telle banqueroute ou faillite, une ex\u00e9cution contre ledit patron serait rapport\u00e9e non satisfaite, dans une action intent\u00e9e par le bless\u00e9 ou par toute autre personne qui r\u00e9clame en vertu d\u2019un droit d\u00e9rivant de lui, alors une action pourra \u00eatre maintenue contre la corporation, en vertu des dispositions de cette police, pour le montant du jugement dans ladite action, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence du montant de cette police.\nOn ne saurait, suivant notre humble opinion, chercher le sens du premier membre de phrase en le d\u00e9tachant de son contexte. Il faut lire la clause dans son ensemble et alors son v\u00e9ritable sens devient clair. C\u2019est une stipulation pour autrui. Dans le cas de banqueroute ou de faillite et dans les conditions sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9es, elle donne \u00e0 l\u2019employ\u00e9 accident\u00e9 (ou \u00e0 toute autre personne r\u00e9clamant en vertu de la loi des accidents du travail) un recours direct et personnel contre la compagnie d\u2019assurance.\nElle n\u2019a donc pas pour effet d\u2019\u00e9carter l\u2019exception non adimpleti contractus si, par ailleurs, cette deni\u00e8re s\u2019applique \u00e0 l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\nMais, sans nous demander pour le moment si cette exception doit trouver place dans notre droit (et nous savons qu\u2019il existe en faveur de l\u2019affirmative des expressions d\u2019opinion absolument respectables \u2014 voir Kuppenheimer v. MacGowan \u2014[5] nous sommes d\u2019avis qu\u2019elle est repouss\u00e9e ici par les conditions m\u00eames du contrat. D\u00e8s que l\u2019accident fut arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 L\u00e9vesque, l\u2019obligation de d\u00e9dommager Dub\u00e9 a exist\u00e9. Il y avait certaines formalit\u00e9s \u00e0 remplir, mais la compagnie ne se plaint pas qu\u2019elles ne l\u2019aient pas \u00e9t\u00e9. Il restait encore \u00e0 fixer le montant du d\u00e9dommagement\u2014et la police pr\u00e9voit qu\u2019il pourra l\u2019\u00eatre\npar un jugement final rendu contre le patron * * * ou par un r\u00e8glement entre les parties auquel la corporation (compagnie d\u2019assurance) aura donn\u00e9 son consentement par \u00e9crit (Clause E),\nmais, d\u00e8s le moment de l\u2019accident (2 ao\u00fbt 1924), l\u2019obligation de l\u2019appelante, \u00e0 raison de cet accident, fut compl\u00e8te et absolue. Elle ne pouvait \u00eatre remplie imm\u00e9diatement et son ex\u00e9cution restait suspendue jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que le montant f\u00fbt liquid\u00e9. Cependant, l\u2019obligation \u00e9tait enti\u00e8re dans ce sens que, en vertu du contrat, l\u2019appelante ne pouvait plus s\u2019y soustraire. Elle \u00e9tait d\u00e8s lors li\u00e9e envers l\u2019assur\u00e9 \u00e0 lui payer le montant de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 d\u00e8s qu\u2019il serait \u00e9tabli. Rien de ce qui pouvait se passer ult\u00e9rieurement ne pouvait plus priver Dub\u00e9 de ce droit acquis. D\u2019ailleurs, la fixation m\u00eame du montant de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 avait, dans ce cas, un caract\u00e8re r\u00e9troactif (Art. 1085 C.C.).\nLe droit \u00e9tait entier d\u00e8s l\u2019accident. Autrement, il faudrait d\u00e9cider que l\u2019existence de ce droit d\u00e9pendrait des d\u00e9lais de proc\u00e9dure, comme, par exemple, si la compagnie e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 poursuivie d\u00e8s l\u2019accident mais que la cause n\u2019e\u00fbt pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en \u00e9tat avant l\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ance de la prime suppl\u00e9mentaire, la compagnie e\u00fbt pu, suivant cette pr\u00e9tention, faire valoir ce moyen avec succ\u00e8s par voie de plaidoyer puis darrein continuans.\nD\u2019accord avec tous les juges qui nous ont pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9s en cette cause, nous croyons qu\u2019il ne saurait en \u00eatre ainsi.\nLa th\u00e9orie de l\u2019ex\u00e9cution simultan\u00e9e, dans l\u2019esprit m\u00eame de ceux qui la pr\u00e9conisent,\nne s\u2019applique qu\u2019autant que la volont\u00e9 des parties ne l\u2019a pas \u00e9cart\u00e9e en r\u00e9glant l\u2019ordre d\u2019ex\u00e9cution des obligations r\u00e9ciproquement assum\u00e9es.\n(Capitant\u2014De la cause des obligations\u20141923\u2014p. 264; Colin et Capitant\u2014Droit civil Fran\u00e7ais, 5e \u00e9d., vol, 2, p. 336; Cassin, De l\u2019exception tir\u00e9e de l\u2019inex\u00e9cution, pp. 531 et 537.\nIci l\u2019intention des parties n\u2019\u00e9tait pas de subordonner une prestation \u00e0 l\u2019autre. L\u2019engagement de la part de Dub\u00e9 de payer la prime suppl\u00e9mentaire n\u2019est pas le fondement de l\u2019engagement de la compagnie d\u2019assurance. La consid\u00e9ration de l\u2019engagement pris par la compagnie a \u00e9t\u00e9 la prime fixe qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9e au d\u00e9but. Moyennant le paiement de cette somme, la compagnie a assum\u00e9 les obligations de la police et elle a consenti \u00e0 devenir responsable du paiement des indemnit\u00e9s avant que la prime suppl\u00e9mentaire ne f\u00fbt acquitt\u00e9e. En sorte que l\u2019acquittement de ce montant additionnel n\u2019\u00e9tait pas une condition pr\u00e9alable\u2014ce qui est \u00e9vident, puisqu\u2019il ne devait s\u2019effectuer qu\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019expiration de la police\u2014ni m\u00eame une condition subs\u00e9quente \u00e0 laquelle fut subordonn\u00e9e l\u2019obligation de d\u00e9dommager ou d\u2019indemniser. La compagnie a entrepris de remplir cette obligation ind\u00e9pendamment de cette prime suppl\u00e9mentaire, pour laquelle elle s\u2019en est rapport\u00e9e exclusivement \u00e0 la promesse de Dub\u00e9. Comme le dit l\u2019appelante dans son factum:\nThe assurer agreed to take the risk, on a chance of being paid at the end of the policy.\nEn plus, si, comme le fait remarquer Baudry-Lacantinerie (Trait\u00e9 de Droit civil, Des obligations, Tome 2, p. 143), l\u2019exception peut \u00eatre envisag\u00e9e comme une forme adoucie du droit de r\u00e9solution, et vu que la prime suppl\u00e9mentaire n\u2019est payable qu\u2019apr\u00e8s le terme de la police, il est difficile de voir comment la compagnie pourrait en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce obtenir la r\u00e9solution du contrat pour cause d\u2019inex\u00e9cution d\u2019une obligation post\u00e9rieure \u00e0 l\u2019expiration du contrat. Elle ne peut opposer cette obligation \u00e0 celle qu\u2019elle a contract\u00e9e de garantir et d\u2019indemniser Dub\u00e9 pendant la dur\u00e9e du contrat. Ce serait admettre que la r\u00e9solution pourrait lui \u00eatre accord\u00e9e au d\u00e9triment des droits acquis de Dub\u00e9.\nEn effet, il ne s\u2019agit pas ici d\u2019un d\u00e9faut absolu de paiement; et il y a lieu de souligner la contradiction dans l\u2019attitude de la compagnie d\u2019assurance qui garderait la prime qu\u2019elle a re\u00e7ue lors de l\u2019\u00e9mission de la police, qui toucherait en outre sa part de dividende sur la prime suppl\u00e9mentaire et qui, malgr\u00e9 cela, n\u2019aurait aucune obligation envers le syndic de son assur\u00e9.\nCette prime suppl\u00e9mentaire est devenue due la veille de la mise en banqueroute de Dub\u00e9. Ce jour-l\u00e0, il ne pouvait payer la compagnie sans faire un paiement pr\u00e9f\u00e9rentiel, donc ill\u00e9gal. Par la suite, la compagnie n\u2019avait pour cette prime aucune cr\u00e9ance privil\u00e9gi\u00e9e. Elle l\u2019a reconnu, en produisant elle-m\u00eame entre les mains du syndic une r\u00e9clamation ordinaire. Le syndic ne refuse pas de la reconna\u00eetre. Il a offert et il offre de la colloquer \u00e0 son rang. C\u2019est d\u2019ailleurs son devoir.\nLa compagnie, qui refuse d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter son contrat, n\u2019en persiste pas moins dans le maintien de sa r\u00e9clamation. Elle demande d\u2019\u00eatre pay\u00e9e sur le m\u00eame plan que les autres cr\u00e9anciers. Bien plus, elle a re\u00e7u la prime initiale. Elle n\u2019offre pas de la rembourser. Elle entend la garder. Cependant, restant en possession de cette prime, r\u00e9clamant en outre suivant la loi de faillite la prime additionnelle et suppl\u00e9mentaire, elle pr\u00e9tend \u00eatre en droit de r\u00e9pudier ses engagements. Comme les deux cours qui nous ont pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9s, nous pensons que cela n\u2019est pas possible en loi.\nNous en concluons que l\u2019appelante est tenue de payer l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 r\u00e9clam\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Le quantum lui-m\u00eame n\u2019en a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 discut\u00e9 devant cette cour, sauf la question de savoir s\u2019il y a lieu d\u2019en d\u00e9duire le montant de la prime suppl\u00e9mentaire. Cette d\u00e9duction n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9e par les plaidoiries \u00e9crites, et le proc\u00e8s ne s\u2019est certainement pas engag\u00e9 dans ce sens, la compagnie soutenant qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait tenue \u00e0 aucune obligation et concluant au rejet de l\u2019action. Le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure n\u2019en contient aucune mention, non plus que celui auquel s\u2019est ralli\u00e9e la majorit\u00e9 des juges de la Cour du Banc du Roi. Mais c\u2019est l\u00e0 le point qui fait l\u2019objet de la dissidence de M. le juge Tellier. Il aurait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 les deux dettes compens\u00e9es pro tanto parce qu\u2019elles proc\u00e8dent l\u2019une et l\u2019autre d\u2019un m\u00eame contrat. Nous croyons que cette suggestion se heurte \u00e0 une objection de principe. A aucun moment avant la faillite de Dub\u00e9, les deux dettes n\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9galement liquides et exigibles (Arts. 1187 et suiv. C.C.). Apr\u00e8s la faillite, la compensation n\u2019\u00e9tait plus possible.\nAu cours de l\u2019argument, une question a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e qui rel\u00e8ve des conclusions de l\u2019action. Le syndic y demande que la somme r\u00e9clam\u00e9e soit pay\u00e9e par l\u2019appelante \u201cpour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de la faillite\u201d. L\u2019accident\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9. Comme il s\u2019agit d\u2019une police de garantie, nous croyons que l\u2019intention du contrat est que le montant de l\u2019assurance soit vers\u00e9 pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de la victime. Nous ne partageons pas la crainte de la compagnie qu\u2019elle soit expos\u00e9e \u00e0 payer deux fois. Nous croyons que le droit de poursuite, qui est donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019employ\u00e9 dans le cas que nous avons discut\u00e9, ne constitue qu\u2019une obligation alternative, et que la compagnie est lib\u00e9r\u00e9e en faisant l\u2019une des deux choses qui en forme l\u2019objet (Art. 1093 C.C.). Mais l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice et l\u2019esprit de la convention exigent que le montant de l\u2019assurance serve \u00e0 payer l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 due \u00e0 la victime de l\u2019accident du travail. Les deux parties l\u2019ont reconnu. L\u2019appelant dit:\nOf course, the assured has a right of enforcement of that obligation, that is an action to force the assurer to pay direct to the beneficiary, at the assured\u2019s discharge, the amounts owing, but the assured has no right, under that obligation, to claim for him for the benefit of his bankrupt estate the amounts stipulated in the policy to be paid to third parties.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9 dit:\nWe submit that even on a judgment in favour of the trustee in our case it might give the capital direct to the injured plus the trustee\u2019s costs, in execution of the judgment.\nBut, at all events, the trustee is an officer of justice acting under the authority of the court, guaranteed by a bond; he could not attribute legally the money paid by the assurance co. to any other purpose than the payment of L\u00e9vesque, a guaranteed creditor under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act and under the Bankruptcy Act. Any interested party could oppose the bordereau, if money should be applied to any other purpose.\nL\u00e9vesque n\u2019\u00e9tant pas en cause, nous entrevoyons des difficult\u00e9s d\u2019ex\u00e9cution si nous ordonnions de payer \u00e0 lui directement. Mais comme le demandeur est un officier de justice, nous maintenons l\u2019action en d\u00e9clarant cependant que le syndic recevra l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice du cr\u00e9ancier L\u00e9vesque et avec instruction de le tenir \u00e0 part des autres fonds de la faillite, et d\u2019en faire remise \u00e0 L\u00e9vesque.\nL\u2019appel est rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nMignault, J. (dissenting).\u2014L\u2019appelante aurait pu \u00e9viter tout ce litige en prenant la pr\u00e9caution d\u2019ins\u00e9rer, dans la police de garantie qu\u2019elle a \u00e9mise, une clause qu\u2019on trouve dans la plupart des polices d\u2019assurance, savoir que le droit de l\u2019assur\u00e9 de se faire indemniser serait subordonn\u00e9 au paiement int\u00e9gral de la prime. Elle avait assur\u00e9 pour une ann\u00e9e le nomm\u00e9 Duncan N. Dub\u00e9, industriel, contre la responsabilit\u00e9 qui incombe aux patrons en vertu de la loi des accidents du travail. Il est vrai que la prime dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce pr\u00e9sentait cette particularit\u00e9 que son montant ne pouvait \u00eatre d\u00e9termin\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 la fin de l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019assurance, car elle \u00e9tait bas\u00e9e sur la somme globale que l\u2019assur\u00e9 aurait pay\u00e9e \u00e0 ses employ\u00e9s durant l\u2019ann\u00e9e. Le contrat fixait d\u2019abord une prime minimum, dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce $125, et ensuite ce qu\u2019on appelait une \u201cprime estim\u00e9e\", savoir $228, que l\u2019assur\u00e9 payait \u00e0 r\u00e9mission de la police. A la fin de l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019assurance il se faisait un ajustement, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire on calculait le montant entier de la prime proportionnellement aux salaires pay\u00e9s par le patron durant l\u2019ann\u00e9e. Si ce montant d\u00e9passait la \u201cprime estim\u00e9e\u201d, le patron payait imm\u00e9diatement la diff\u00e9rence, savoir un suppl\u00e9ment de prime. Si le montant calcul\u00e9 \u00e9tait inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 la \u201cprime estim\u00e9e\u201d, l\u2019assureur faisait une remise \u00e0 l\u2019assur\u00e9 de tout ce qui d\u00e9passait la prime minimum, mais il gardait cette derni\u00e8re prime quel que f\u00fbt le r\u00e9sultat du calcul. Il y avait donc une prime minimum d\u00e9finitivement acquise \u00e0 l\u2019assureur, une \u201cprime estim\u00e9e\u201d payable d\u2019avance, et, si cette \u201cprime estim\u00e9e\u201d se trouvait inf\u00e9rieure au montant calcul\u00e9 \u00e0 la fin de l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019apr\u00e8s les salaires pay\u00e9s par le patron, un suppl\u00e9ment de prime que le patron devait imm\u00e9diatement, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire aussit\u00f4t que le montant en serait d\u00e9termin\u00e9, verser \u00e0 l\u2019assureur.\nLa police d\u2019assurance expirait le 26 janvier 1925. A cette \u00e9poque, on fit l\u2019ajustement pr\u00e9vu, et Dub\u00e9 se trouva alors d\u00e9biteur envers l\u2019appelant de la somme de $1,020.58, suppl\u00e9ment de prime, payable imm\u00e9diatement. Deux jours plus tard, le 28 janvier 1925, Dub\u00e9 tomba en faillite sans avoir pay\u00e9 ce suppl\u00e9ment de prime.\nOr, durant l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019assurance, au mois d\u2019ao\u00fbt 1924, un nomm\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque, employ\u00e9 par Dub\u00e9, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d\u2019un accident du travail. Il n\u2019appert pas que Dub\u00e9 ait donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appelante l\u2019avis de cet accident comme l\u2019exigeait la police. L\u2019appelante, cependant, ne se plaint pas de ce d\u00e9faut d\u2019avis comme cause d\u2019annulation du contrat, mais c\u2019est une circonstance qu\u2019on doit mentionner dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des faits de la cause. Le dossier ne fait pas voir non plus si L\u00e9vesque avait fait une r\u00e9clamation contre Dub\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieurement au 28 janvier 1925, date de la cession de biens de Dub\u00e9, alors qu\u2019il lui fit signifier une requ\u00eate pour permission d\u2019intenter une poursuite sous la loi des accidents du travail. Il n\u2019appert pas non plus qu\u2019avis de cette requ\u00eate ait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appelante. Enfin, le 5 mars 1925, L\u00e9vesque demanda la permission de poursuivre le syndic de Dub\u00e9, et cette fois copie de la deuxi\u00e8me requ\u00eate de L\u00e9vesque fut transmise \u00e0 l\u2019appelante.\nCependant, dans l\u2019intervalle, savoir le 9 f\u00e9vrier 1925, l\u2019appelante avait produit entre les mains du gardien provisoire de Dub\u00e9 une r\u00e9clamation dite non garantie pour le suppl\u00e9ment de prime. En recevant du syndic copie de la deuxi\u00e8me requ\u00eate de L\u00e9vesque, l\u2019appelante r\u00e9pondit qu\u2019elle se chargerait de la d\u00e9fense de la faillite Dub\u00e9 sur paiement du suppl\u00e9ment de prime, \u00e0 quoi le syndic r\u00e9pliqua qu\u2019elle serait pay\u00e9e avec les autres cr\u00e9anciers \u201cau marc la livre\u201d. Le 18 mars 1925, L\u00e9vesque intenta une action contre le syndic, et ce dernier en envoya copie \u00e0 l\u2019appelante, qui r\u00e9it\u00e9ra qu\u2019elle ne d\u00e9fendrait la faillite Dub\u00e9 que sur paiement de la prime. La poursuite de L\u00e9vesque suivit donc son cours et le demandeur obtint, le 19 mai 1925, un jugement ex parte contre le syndic pour $5,300. Alors celui-ci produisit une opposition \u00e0 jugement, mais sur nouvelle instruction de la cause, L\u00e9vesque obtint, le 8 mars 1926, un nouveau jugement pour le m\u00eame montant, avec, bien entendu, de nouveaux frais contre le syndic. Le 20 avril 1926, un bref d\u2019ex\u00e9cution fut \u00e9mis contre le syndic, mais on ne para\u00eet pas avoir donn\u00e9 effet \u00e0 ce bref.\nLe 22 janvier 1927, le syndic poursuivit l\u2019appelante lui r\u00e9clamant, en vertu de la police d\u2019assurance, $6,490 qu\u2019il devait \u00e0 L\u00e9vesque pour capital, int\u00e9r\u00eat et frais, et par ses conclusions il demanda que l\u2019appelante f\u00fbt condamn\u00e9e \u00e0 lui payer cette somme pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de la faillite Dub\u00e9.\nL\u2019appelante, en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019action, oppose \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 l\u2019exception dite de non adimpleti contractus, mais \u00e0 tort elle s\u2019en autorise pour demander le rejet pur et simple de la demande de l\u2019intim\u00e9. Il est \u00e0 remarquer que l\u2019effet de cette exception est de suspendre l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de l\u2019obligation, et non pas d\u2019an\u00e9antir l\u2019obligation elle-m\u00eame. On ne peut opposer l\u2019exception que lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un contrat synallagmatique, et que les prestations des deux parties sont \u00e9galement exigibles. Pour emprunter le langage de Planiol (Trait\u00e9 \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire de Droit civil, 10e \u00e9dition, avec la collaboration de Georges Ripert, t. 2, n\u00b0 949), \u201cdans tout rapport synallagmatique, chacune des deux parties ne peut exiger la prestation qui lui est due que si elle offre elle-m\u00eame d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter la sienne\u201d. Ainsi le vendeur n\u2019est oblig\u00e9 de livrer la chose vendue sans terme que si l\u2019acheteur en paie le prix (art. 1496 C.C.), et l\u2019acheteur qui a juste sujet de craindre d\u2019\u00eatre troubl\u00e9 par une action hypoth\u00e9caire ou en revendication, peut diff\u00e9rer le paiement du prix jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que le vendeur fasse cesser le trouble ou lui fournisse caution (art. 1535 C.C.). Dans l\u2019un et l\u2019autre cas il n\u2019y a que suspension de l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de l\u2019obligation.\nDans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce qui nous est soumise, le suppl\u00e9ment de prime n\u2019\u00e9tait d\u00fb qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019expiration de l\u2019ann\u00e9e, ce qui \u00e9tait moins un terme accord\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019assur\u00e9 que la fixation d\u2019une date o\u00f9 il serait possible de calculer le montant de ce suppl\u00e9ment. Cependant, durant l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019assurance, toutes les obligations de l\u2019assureur existaient et, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant et aux conditions stipul\u00e9es, l\u2019assur\u00e9 aurait pu en exiger l\u2019accomplissement. Donc la possibilit\u00e9 que l\u2019assur\u00e9 se trouverait plus tard redevable d\u2019un suppl\u00e9ment de prime n\u2019aurait pas permis \u00e0 l\u2019assureur, avant tout d\u00e9faut de la part de l\u2019assur\u00e9, de lui refuser l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de son obligation.\nCette situation, cependant, se changeait du moment que le suppl\u00e9ment de prime devenait exigible. Si apr\u00e8s l\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ance de ce suppl\u00e9ment, \u00e0 un moment donc o\u00f9 l\u2019assur\u00e9 en \u00e9tait d\u00e9biteur, il \u00e9tait survenu une r\u00e9clamation contre l\u2019assureur \u00e0 raison d\u2019une stipulation du contrat d\u2019assurance, l\u2019assureur, me semble-t-il, aurait pu suspendre l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de son obligation jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que l\u2019assur\u00e9 e\u00fbt rempli la sienne en versant le montant du suppl\u00e9ment de prime. Je crois qu\u2019il est indubitable que si Dub\u00e9 n\u2019e\u00fbt pas fait faillite, toute r\u00e9clamation de sa part en vertu d\u2019un droit d\u2019action prenant naissance au moment o\u00f9 L\u00e9vesque fit signifier sa requ\u00eate pour permission de poursuivre en vertu de la loi des accidents du travail, aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 subordonn\u00e9e au paiement du suppl\u00e9ment de prime.\nEn tout cela il ne s\u2019agit pas de compensation, car il n\u2019y a pas de compensation possible entre les prestations r\u00e9ciproques des parties en vertu d\u2019un m\u00eame contrat (Aubry et Rau, 5e \u00e9d., t. 4, p. 374, note 5bis; Demolombe, t. 28, n. 506; Baudry-Lacantinerie et Barde, Obligations, t. 3, no. 1825 in fine). Nous sommes en pr\u00e9sence ici de prestations \u00e9chues et qui doivent s\u2019ex\u00e9cuter en m\u00eame temps, et le d\u00e9faut de l\u2019une des parties de remplir sa part d\u2019obligation autorise l\u2019autre \u00e0 suspendre l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de la sienne.\nLa faillite change-t-elle cette situation? Je ne le crois pas. Ainsi supposons que le failli, avant sa faillite, avait achet\u00e9 une maison. Pouvait-il en demander livraison sans en payer le prix? Certainement que non. Ou bien, le failli avait obtenu une promesse de vente; pouvait-il exiger la passation d\u2019un contrat de vente sans offrir le prix? Qu\u2019on ne dise pas que payer ce prix serait un paiement pr\u00e9f\u00e9rentiel et partant impossible, car le failli, pas plus que tout autre, ne peut exiger l\u2019accomplissement d\u2019un contrat synallagmatique \u00e0 moins de fournir la prestation que le contrat lui impose.\nRevenons maintenant aux faits de cette cause. La r\u00e9clamation de L\u00e9vesque n\u2019est faite qu\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ance de l\u2019obligation de Dub\u00e9 de payer le suppl\u00e9ment de prime. L\u2019accident seul ne fait pas na\u00eetre une obligation \u00e0 la charge de l\u2019assureur, il faut encore qu\u2019avis de cet accident lui ait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 (Cassation, 27 janvier 1925, Sirey, 1925, 1, 14). Or, l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne pr\u00e9tend pas que cette notification ait \u00e9t\u00e9 fournie \u00e0 l\u2019appelante. Tout ce qui appert au dossier, c\u2019est que celle-ci a re\u00e7u, plusieurs semaines apr\u00e8s l\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ance du suppl\u00e9ment de prime, copie d\u2019une requ\u00eate par laquelle L\u00e9vesque demandait \u00e0 \u00eatre autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 poursuivre le syndic de Dub\u00e9. Il est vrai que l\u2019appelante a produit \u00e0 la faillite sa r\u00e9clamation pour le suppl\u00e9ment de prime, mais elle l\u2019a fait avant toute notification de l\u2019accident survenu \u00e0 L\u00e9vesque, et, dans ces circonstances, la production de sa r\u00e9clamation est sans port\u00e9e d\u00e9cisive contre elle.\nQuand m\u00eame il s\u2019agirait ici d\u2019une cr\u00e9ance payable \u00e0 terme, il est certain qu\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ance du terme la cr\u00e9ance devient pure et simple (Baudry-Lacantinerie et Barde, Obligations, n\u00b0 1000). Et permettre \u00e0 l\u2019une des parties, apr\u00e8s cette \u00e9ch\u00e9ance, d\u2019exiger l\u2019accomplissement des obligations de l\u2019autre partie sans fournir en m\u00eame temps la prestation qu\u2019elle avait elle-m\u00eame promise, serait contraire \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle qui exige l\u2019ex\u00e9cution simultan\u00e9e des obligations qui d\u00e9coulent d\u2019un contrat synallagmatique.\nJe regrette beaucoup de ne pouvoir partager l\u2019opinion de mon coll\u00e8gue M. le juge Rinfret. Je ne crois pas qu\u2019il y ait divergence entre nous quant aux principes que j\u2019ai expos\u00e9s plus haut. Je diff\u00e8re de sa mani\u00e8re de voir parce que le droit d\u2019action en vertu de la police, dans mon opinion, n\u2019a pris naissance que lorsque Dub\u00e9 \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 en d\u00e9faut de payer le suppl\u00e9ment de prime.\nJe puis terminer en citant un dictum du juge Brewer de la cour supr\u00eame des Etats-Unis dans la cause de Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Hill[6] Courts have always set their faces against an insurance company which, having received its premiums, has sought by technical defences to avoid payment, and in like manner should they set their faces against an effort to exact payment from an insurance company when the premiums have deliberately been left unpaid.\nJe ferais droit \u00e0 l\u2019appel avec les frais de toutes les cours, et je n\u2019obligerais l\u2019appelante \u00e0 indemniser l\u2019intim\u00e9 du jugement que L\u00e9vesque a obtenu contre elle que sur paiement int\u00e9gral du suppl\u00e9ment de prime.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Patenaude, Mouette, Filion & Boyer.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Gagnon & Simard.\n[1] (1928) Q.O.R. 45 K.B. 224.\n[2] (1928) Q.O.R. 45 K.B. 224.\n[3] [1922] 63 Can.

The plan showed many lots \u201cnot granted,\u201d including those numbered 247, 249 and 251, which were side by side and went back from the river St. John to a \u201cdesigned road,\u201d the distances back not being designated. In a Crown grant, known as the \u201cSaunders grant,\u201d in 1819, under which the plaintiff claimed, there were excepted lots 247, 249, and 251 \u201cas described in the said Prince William grant, being reserved by us for a glebe.\u201d Attached to the Saunders grant was a plan which showed the side lines of said excepted land as running back from the river 92 chains and 81 chains respectively. A grant in 1836 conveyed to a church for a glebe land of which the description therein coincided in effect with lots 247, 249 and 251 for a distance measured back from the river of 92 chains on one side and of 81 chains on the other. As found on the evidence, the distances along said side lines from the river to the \u201cdesigned road\u201d in the Prince William grant plan extended, by ground measurement, much beyond said 92 and 81 chains; and it was the area so beyond that was in dispute, the plaintiff, which claimed damages for trespass, contending that the Saunders plan regulated the locality and area of the excepted lots and that the disputed land passed under the Saunders grant.\nHeld: It was the Prince William grant that determined the dimensions and locality of the excepted lots; and as it mentioned no distances for their side lines, which were otherwise limited by the designed road, upon which the lots were based; and as the position of these lots, as inset upon the Saunders plan, with regard to a certain lake and to the designed road, corresponded with that shown upon the Prince William grant plan; and in view of the actual situation and measurements on the ground, the distances of 92 and 81 chains mentioned in the Saunders grant plan should not control, but should give way to more definite and convincing evidence of intention arising from the relative physical situations. Furthermore, as it is a rule of interpretation that Crown grants of this character ought to be constructed most favourably to the Crown, it should follow that the statement of erroneous distances, tending to reduce the excepted area, upon the inset of the Saunders grant plan, ought not to control the interpretation of the exception as derived by express reference to the Prince William grant. Plaintiff, therefore, had not shewn title to the disputed land.\nJudgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick ([1929] 1 D.L.R. 168), which set aside verdict at trial in defendant\u2019s favour and gave judgment for plaintiff, reversed.\nA party should not be granted a new trial on the ground of non-direction in the trial judge\u2019s charge to the jury, where, having opportunity to do so, he did not ask the judge to give the direction the omission of which he complains of. (Neville v. Fine Art & Gen. Ins. Co., [1897] A.C. 68, at p. 76, cited).\nAPPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division[1], which allowed the plaintiff\u2019s appeal from the judgment of Le Blanc J., upon the verdict of a jury, in favour of the defendant, in an action by the plaintiff to recover damages for alleged trespass. The judgment of the Appeal Division ordered that the verdict entered for the defendant be set aside and that a verdict be entered for the plaintiff for damages, the amount thereof to be ascertained by a new trial (confined to that question) unless the parties reached an agreement in respect thereof.\nThe material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was allowed, with costs in this Court and the Appeal Division, and the verdict of the jury and judgment of the trial judge restored.\nJ. B. McNair for the appellant.\nP. J. Hughes K.C. and C. L. Dougherty for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nNewcombe J.\u2014The question at issue depends upon the extent of the exception in the grant of King George III, on behalf of the Province of New Brunswick, to the Honourable John Saunders, dated 11th February, 1819. The exception is expressed in these words:\nAnd excepting. * * * Also the lots number Two Hundred and Forty-seven, number Two Hundred and Forty-nine and number Two Hundred and Fifty-one as described in the said Prince William Grant, being reserved by us for a glebe. The validity of the exception is not in controversy.\nThe plaintiff claims under the Saunders grant, and seeks to recover damages for trespass for the cutting of trees upon the area in dispute, which, if not comprised within the exception, would be within the limits of the Saunders grant. The cutting is established, or admitted, and the locus is sufficiently identified, but the defendant denies the plaintiff\u2019s alleged title and possession or right to possession.\nIt is necessary to look at the earlier instrument, known as the Prince William grant. By letters patent of New Brunswick of 19th May, 1786, the King granted\nunto the several Grantees hereinafter named in severalty to each of them and unto each and every of their several and respective Heirs and Assigns certain Lots or Plantations of Land known and distinguished by their respective numbers herein mentioned, that is to say, unto Francis Horsman the Lot Number One, unto John Alloway the Lots Number Twenty-one, Twenty-two, Twenty-three, Twenty-four, Twenty-five, and Twenty-six,\netc. The grant proceeds to mention the names of a great many other grantees, with the numbers of the respective lots granted to each, followed by an explanatory clause, and the description, reading as follows:\nThe said Lots hereby granted as aforesaid being part of Two Hundred and Sixty-two lots described on the Plan hereunto annexed and contained within a certain Tract or Parcel of Land situate, lying and being in the Parish of Prince William in the County of York in our Province of New Brunswick in America and abutted and bounded as follows, to wit, beginning at a Cedar Tree marked KAD on the Northwest bank of the River Saint John nearly opposite the lower end of Scoodewabscook Island and Twenty-five chains (of four poles each) and fifty Links measured on a right line distant from the point which forms the entrance of Scoodewabscook Creek or River to the Westward, the said Cedar being the Upper or Northwesterly boundary of a Tract of Land granted to Colonel Isaac Allen and Associates, thence running (by the magnetic needle) South forty-five degrees West, One hundred and fifty-two Chains (of four Poles each) or until it meets the Northeast Corner of a Tract of Land reserved for His Majesty\u2019s use by His Majesty\u2019s Surveyor General of Woods at a Hemlock Tree marked IW, thence along the northerly line of the said reserve North forty-five degrees West, one hundred and Twenty chains to a Spruce Tree marked IW at the northwest corner thereof, thence along the westerly Line of the said reserve, South forty-five degrees west one hundred and ten chains, thence North forty-five degrees West nine hundred and forty chains or until it meets the westerly line of a designed road, to run from the northwest bank of the River Saint John sixteen poles wide parallel to and adjoining the westerly or upper line of the Lots Number Two Hundred and Sixty-one and Two hundred and Sixty-two, thence along the westerly line of the said designed road North forty-five degrees east two hundred and Thirty chains or until it meets the westerly bank or shore of the River Saint John, thence along the said bank or shore following the several courses of the said river down stream to the bounds first mentioned, containing in the whole twenty thousand two hundred and forty-one acres, more or less, with an allowance of four thousand two hundred and fifty acres for roads and waste, each of the said Lots (contained as aforesaid within the Tract above described) measuring in breadth on a right line at right angles to the sides thereof thirty-two poles and the division lines of the said lots running from their respective boundaries (marked on each side of a designed road sixteen poles wide described on the said Plan hereunto annexed) north forty-five degrees east (by the magnet) to the bank or shore of the River Saint John and South forty-five degrees west to the rear or westerly line of the whole Tract, the said road dividing the lots into two ranges and the lower or easterly line of the said road running (by the magnet) north forty-five degrees west through the whole Tract from a Cedar Sapling on the first described line of the said Tract marked KAD and distant on the said Line from the first mentioned bounds One hundred and three chains (of four poles each) which said tract above described and the said lots therein contained have such shape form and marks as appear by the actual Survey thereof made under the directions of our Surveyor General of our said Province, of which Survey the said Plan hereunto annexed is a representation, whereon is also noted the quantity of land respectively contained in each and every of the said lots.\nIt will be observed that this description includes a tract of considerable extent, and that the lots enumerated are divided into two tiers, upper and lower, separated by \u201ca designed road\u201d for which, as shewn by the plan accompanying the grant, there is a reservation of 16 rods in width. The lots are laid out to abut upon this road on either hand, and the side lines of the lots are not projected across it; the lower lots bear the odd numbers, and the upper lots, the even. It thus becomes obvious that, in order to locate the lots in accordance with the survey, description and plan of the Prince William grant, it is necessary to find the location of the designed road.\nThe plan shews a lake about 160 chains in length by 100 chains in breadth, within the bounds of the tract granted, and towards its northwesterly end; it is called Prince William Lake, or, sometimes, Davidson Lake. This is a natural feature of much importance, because the lake, on its lower side, intersects the road, and extends below the road for a distance of about 15 chains, thus impinging upon, or overlying, or reducing the lower tier of lots for that width, and for nearly the entire length of the lake.\nAnother noteworthy fact is that many of the delineated and enumerated lots, especially at the northwesterly end of the tract, do not bear the names of grantees, but, on the contrary, are expressly marked \u201cnot granted.\u201d As to these, so far as I can perceive, the grant did not operate to affect the Crown\u2019s title, and they remained Crown lands; and of this character are lots 247, 249 and 251, already mentioned.\nNow it will be found that if the plan of the Saunders grant be superimposed upon the Prince William grant, beginning at the northwesterly line of Peter Ganter\u2019s lot, No. 219, where it touches the river on the latter plan, the Saunders plan will occupy the entire area of the Prince William grant to the northwest of lots 219 and 220, and to that extent it overlies, subject, of course, to the exceptions. That part of the waters of the lake which lie within the bounds of the Saunders grant is, however, excepted, as well as some lots, which had been previously granted, and so we come to the exception above quoted, of lots 247, 249 and 251, \u201cas described in the said Prince William grant, being reserved by us for a glebe.\u201d These lots therefore did not pass under the Saunders grant; but, by letters patent of 15th September, 1836, lands described as follows were granted to the Rector, Church Wardens and Vestry of Saint Paul\u2019s Church of the Parish of Dumfries,\nfor a Glebe a Tract of Land situate in the Parish of Dumfries in the County of York in our Province of New Brunswick and bounded as follows, to wit, Beginning at the Northerly angle of Lot number Two hundred and forty-five, in the Grant to The Honourable John Saunders, and on the Southeasterly side of the River Saint John; thence by the magnetic needle south forty-six degrees and thirty minutes West ninety-two chains of four poles each; thence North forty-three degrees and thirty minutes West twenty-four chains; thence North forty-six degrees and thirty minutes East eighty-one chains to the said side of the aforesaid River Saint John and thence along the Bank or Shore of said River down Stream to the place of beginning, containing two hundred and twenty-eight acres, more or less, and also particularly described and marked on the Plot or Plan of Survey hereunto annexed; * * *\nThis grant conveys the excepted lots, 247, 249 and 251, for the distance of 92 chains on the lower side-line, and 81 chains on the upper side-line, leaving still ungranted the rear portion of these lots between the line of the Church grant, described as \u201cnorth 43 degrees and 30 minutes west 24 chains,\u201d and the designed road, or \u201cAlma Road,\u201d as it is frequently spoken of in the case, and this rear portion constitutes the area or locus of the alleged trespass. Upon the assumption that the plaintiff company has not acquired title to this parcel, its action fails. It is shewn that the actual width of the Prince William grant at the locality in question exceeds its width as ascertained by the scale of the grant by about 40 chains, and this excess was admitted at the argument before us. In 1882, a surveyor named Bellamy traced on the ground the rear line of the Church grant at the distance from the river called for by that grant. There is no dispute as to that line, and it is the area extending from it for 40 chains to the southwestward that is in dispute. At the trial, the plain tiff\u2019s counsel, in opening his case to the jury, referred to the Church grant as corresponding with the glebe reservation in the Saunders grant, but he said, very frankly, that he thought that the lots in the Prince William grant went back very much farther than 92 chains from the river; that the real issue was the establishing of the rear line; and that, if the defendant were right in going back to the extension of the \u201cold road running through Prince William in the Prince William grant,\u201d there had been no trespass.\nWe are told that the trial of the case occupied seven days, and there are 350 pages of testimony, exclusive of the documents. The locality of the designed road upon the ground, particularly on the northwesterly side of the lake, so far as lines are concerned which indicate its position, is somewhat confused and obscure, because the road has not been constructed there and put into use, but considerable testimony was introduced.\nThe plaintiff relied upon the plan attached to the Saunders grant, upon which are traced the lines of the excepted lots, shewing the outside or lower line of lot 247 as running from its starting point at the river, south 46 degrees and 30 minutes west, in 1818, 92 chains, thence at right angles 24 chains until it meets the outside or upper line of lot 251, which is drawn from the river to the point of intersection, parallel to the side-line of lot 247, a distance of 81 chains; and the force of the plaintiff\u2019s argument lies in the contention that this plan regulates the locality and area of the excepted lots, and that, as they are shewn by the Saunders grant plan to extend from the river only 92 chains on the one side, and 81 chains on the other, the land beyond these distances passed under the latter grant, and belongs to the plaintiff company, which has succeeded, under the conveyances in proof, to the Saunders title. But there are governing considerations which conflict with this view. It is the Prince William grant that determines the dimensions and locality of the excepted lots, and it mentions no distances for their side-lines, which are otherwise limited by the designed road, upon which the lots are based; and moreover, the position of these lots, as inset upon the Saunders plan, with regard to the lake and to the designed road, corresponds with that shewn upon the Prince William grant. Consequently, when it is shewn that the lake is more than 92 chains from the river, and that the front line of the designed road, as shewn on the Saunders plan, on the left or northeasterly side of the lake, when produced across the lake, coincides with the rear limit of the excepted lot, it becomes unreasonable to permit the distances of 92 chains and 81 chains to control; and, upon general principles, these distances must give way to more definite and convincing evidence of intention, arising from the relative situation of the lake and the projected road upon which these lots are based.\nFurthermore, it is a rule of interpretation of Crown grants of this character that they shall be construed most favourably to the Crown; wherefore it should follow that the statement of erroneous distances, tending to reduce the excepted area, upon the inset of the plan accompanying the Saunders grant, ought not to control the interpretation of the exception as derived by express reference to the Prince William grant, by which the excepted lots were constituted and defined, and extend from the river by ground measurement 40 chains farther.\nThe action was tried before LeBlanc J. with a jury. The learned judge in his charge pointed out that the plaintiff relied upon a documentary title; but he said that he would not withdraw from the consideration of the jury a title by possession, inasmuch as both sides had attempted to produce evidence of possession. He explained that in order to interpret the Saunders grant it was necessary to go back to the Prince William grant, to see what was excluded, and that it was for the jury to find, by the evidence, the location upon the ground of the designed road, which limited, at the rear, the excepted lots; that the Saunders grant took effect at the time it was made, and if it were found that there was an ungranted area between the Alma road and the Bellamy line, the jury should further consider whether the plaintiff had proved such possession as would establish a prescriptive title; and he directed the jury\u2019s attention to the evidence. He told the jury that the defendant had no documentary title, although he admitted the cutting upon the locus. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel made several suggestions during the course of the charge, but he does not appear to have requested the learned judge to give any material instruction to the jury which was not submitted.\nThe judgment of the Appeal Division was pronounced by Grimmer J., and the principal difference between the trial judge and the Appeal Division, as I understand their respective views, appears to be that, whereas the jury were told in effect that if they found the designed road to be where it was shewn to be by the Prince William plan, there would be 40 chains ungranted between that and the Bellamy line, the Appeal Division, on the other hand, would limit the length of the excepted area to 92 chains on one side and 81 chains on the other, leaving the excess to pass under the grant. I am disposed, with great deference, to reject the latter view, for the reasons which I have stated; and the verdict must, I think, be held to imply that the road is found to be where it is depicted in relation to the lake, as shewn on the Prince William grant, and at the ascertained distance of 40 chains above the Bellamy line, and so to justify, according to the submissions of the parties, the general verdict for the defendant.\nThe learned judge of appeal was, I think, unduly impressed by the fact that the road was not, on the Saunders plan, projected across the lake or shewn within the limits of the Saunders grant, but that, in my view, is a circumstance of no importance, if, as I apprehend, we must look to the earlier grant to ascertain what was intended to be included within the excepted lots.\nThe question of possession was also considered in the appeal judgment, but with the preliminary passage:\nThat there was controversy between the different owners of the Glebe lots and the owners of the adjoining lots in the rear is evident from the great mass of evidence that was produced relating thereto, and the number of lines that were run, and that there was more or less cutting upon some of the rear lots by different persons at different times is also evident, but this case rests entirely upon the title of the plaintiff in Lots 2 and 3. The reference here to lots 2 and 3 relates to a subdivision of the Saunders property after the death of the grantee, and these two lots, which belong to the subdivision, appear to occupy the space which was covered by the lower end of lots 248, 250 and 252 in the upper tier of the Prince William grant, opposite to the disputed area, and which, wherever they were situate, were separated from the locus by the road; and the court would have been right in affirming the plaintiff\u2019s title only if the road were found to coincide on its lower side with the Bellamy line, or to lie below it. The learned judge proceeds to premise his observations upon the question of possession by saying that,\nWhile so far as this judgment is concerned the question of possession does not enter into it to any great extent yet the effect of the charge which in my opinion was clearly wrong, upon a jury that might be wavering over the question of a documentary title might readily be all that was needed to enable them to render the verdict appealed from.\nFollow some references to cases with regard to possessory title, and to the testimony in the case, and the learned judge says that:\nThere was much evidence given by the Crown Land surveyors who were respectively employed to run the lines of the parties to the action from time to time, but from the continued repetition that was made by both counsel on the trial it is a matter of practical impossibility to me to follow and I do not well see how the jury after a seven days trial could possibly have followed and intelligently understood the meanderings of these men.\nBut, if I do not misapprehend the purpose of the learned judge, I am disposed to think that, in speaking of misdirection, he refers to the omission of the trial judge to instruct the jury on the footing that the plaintiff company, being in possession, under deeds of the subdivisions, lots 2 and 3, was entitled to refer the acts of possession of itself or its predecessors to the whole area included within the subdivisions, and that if, according to the metes and bounds, the disputed area was part of the subdivisions, these acts of possession would be referable to the latter area, as well as to the upper portions of the lots upon which the acts of possession actually took place. But in answer to this it is in effect said, and I think justly, that, in the first place, the learned judge at the trial was not asked to submit any such instruction to the jury; and, as was said in Nevill v. Fine Art and General Insurance Company[2]: That would, but for what I am about to say, give the appellant only a right to ask for a new trial, which, though he has not asked for it, it is no doubt within your Lordships\u2019 competence to give him; but what puts him out of court in that respect is this, that where you are complaining of non-direction of the judge, or that he did not leave a question to the jury, if you had an opportunity of asking him to do it and you abstained from asking for it, no Court would ever have granted you a new trial; for the obvious reason that if you thought you had got enough you were not allowed to stand aside and let all the expense be incurred and a new trial ordered simply because of your own neglect.\nAnd, secondly, if such a direction as I have indicated had been given, it could have served no useful purpose, because all the difficulties of location which are incident to the case would have attended upon the attempt to locate the boundaries of the subdivisions, which seem to have been intended to affect nothing which had not passed to Saunders under his original grant; and there is evidence that no cutting was done on the part of the plaintiff below the road; and moreover, that any cutting which was done below the road was on behalf of the proprietors or occupants of the lower lots.\nIn conclusion, Grimmer J. says:\nThe conclusion I have reached is that under ordinary circumstances a new trial would be granted by reason of the misdirection of the learned trial judge as pointed out, but as I am satisfied the plaintiff has fully proved its title in the locus and this Court has before it all the materials necessary for finally determining the questions in dispute, and in order to prevent further appeals and costly litigation, the verdict for the defendant should be set aside and a verdict entered for the plaintiff. But inasmuch as there has been no finding by the jury on the matter of damages there shall be a new trial to be confined exclusively to ascertain the amount of damages, if any, the plaintiff is entitled to, unless the parties in interest within thirty days from the date of this judgment reach an agreement between themselves in respect thereof.\nI do not think, however, that the Court of Appeal was justified in substituting its finding for that of the jury; I think, moreover, that there was evidence before the jury which reasonably supports its finding; and I see no sufficient reason to set that finding aside.\nIn the result, therefore, I would allow the appeal, with costs here and in the court below.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Winslow & McNair.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Charles L.

In his application for insurance M. warranted that \u201cmy occupation and specific duties are fully described as president and general manager of lumber company, office duty only and travelling,\u201d and agreed to have his occupation classed as \u201cselect,\u201d and for reduction of insurer\u2019s liability if insured was injured \u201cwhile engaged in any occupation or exposure to danger\u201d classed as more hazardous than that stated. A term of the policy provided for such reduction of liability if insured was injured \u201cwhile engaged either temporarily, casually or permanently in an occupation classed as more hazardous\u201d than that stated. M. was crushed between two railway box cars, resulting in his death. Defendant alleged that M. at the time of the accident was trying to engineer the movement of a box car, and therefore, under the contract, plaintiff (beneficiary thereunder) was not entitled to the full amount of the policy, which she claimed. The jury, in answer to questions submitted, found that M. died by accidental injury, that at the time of injury he was not engaged in any occupation other than that of \u201cpresident and general manager of lumber company, office duty only and travelling,\u201d and was not \u201cengaged in any exposure to danger more hazardous than office duty.\u201d They expressed inability to find what act M. was doing at the time of the accident. Judgment was given for plaintiff, which was affirmed by the Appeal Division (N.B.).\nHeld (1) On the evidence, it could not be said that the jury erred in failing to find what M. was doing, or whether or not he was on a box car, at the time of the accident; and that, on the jury\u2019s findings, judgment for plaintiff was the only possible outcome of the action.\n(2) Even had M. been trying to engineer the movement of a box car at the time of the accident, that fact alone would not warrant judgment for defendant. The doing of that single isolated act, ordinarily forming part of the duties of a more hazardous occupation, would not amount to \u201cengaging in\u201d such occupation \u201ceither temporarily, casually or permanently.\u201d\n(3) If a specific exception to the risk undertaken in an insurance policy be described in the policy itself, as well as in the application therefor (although the latter be incorporated in the former), the insured is ordinarily justified in insisting that, as between him and the insurer, the words of the policy shall, if they differ from those of the application, be taken as evidencing, in that particular, the contract by which both are bound. And where the terms employed in the policy are reasonably susceptible of a construction which does not include in the exception, stipulated by the insurer in its own interest, the doing of an isolated act of extra hazard, that construction must prevail. Ontario Metal Products Co. v. Mutual Life Ins. Co., [1924] S.C.R. 35, at p. 41; [1925] AC 344; Victory v. Saskatchewan Guarantee & Fidelity Co., [1928] S.C.R. 264, at p. 273, cited.\nAPPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division, affirming the judgment of Byrne J. (on the findings of a jury) for the plaintiff at trial.\nThe defendant issued a policy of accident insurance to one Frederick B. Mahoney. The plaintiff, his sister, was named in the policy as beneficiary in case of his death by accident under the provisions of the policy. The application for the policy (set out in the policy under the heading \u201cSchedule of Warranties\u201d) contained, inter alia, the following statements, warranted to be true, by the insured:\n7. My occupation and specific duties are fully described as President and General Manager of Lumber Company, office duty only and travelling.\n8. I understand the classification of risks and agree to have my occupation classed as Select, and I further agree that for any injury received by me while engaged in any occupation or exposure to danger classed by the Company as more hazardous than that above stated, I shall be entitled to recover only such amount as the premium paid by me would purchase at the rates fixed for such increased hazard.\nThe policy contained the following provision:\n(2) If the injury is sustained by (or sickness happens to) the Insured while engaged either temporarily, casually or permanently in an occupation classed as more hazardous than that stated herein (other than as provided for injury in Section G [not material in this case]), liability here- under shall be limited to such amount as the premium paid would have purchased for the increased hazard according to the Company\u2019s table of rates and classification of risks last filed by the Company, with the Superintendent of Insurance; Provided, that the performance of ordinary duties about his residence or while engaged in recreation shall not be regarded as a change of occupation.\nThe insured was injured by being crushed between two railway box cars (as found by this Court, and also by the Appeal Division which held that the jury\u2019s answer, \u201cDon\u2019t know,\u201d on this point, was perverse), and died as the result. The defendant alleged that at the time of the accident the insured was trying to engineer the movement of a box car, and that, therefore, under the terms of the application and policy above quoted, the plaintiff was not entitled to recover the full amount named in the policy, for which full amount the plaintiff sued.\nOn the answers by the jury to questions submitted (which are set out in the judgment now reported), judgment was given for the plaintiff, which was affirmed by the Appeal Division. The defendant appealed to this Court.\nGideon Grant K.C. and W. H. Harrison K.C., for the appellant.\nJ. F. H. Teed for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nAnglin C.J.C\u2014Omitting what is contentious, the following \u201cstatement of facts\u201d is taken, practically verbatim, from that given by the appellant in its factum:\n\u201cThis is an appeal by the defendant from the judgment of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, confirming the judgment of Mr. Justice Byrne and a jury, awarding the plaintiff the sum of Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000) payable in instalments.\n\u201cThe action was brought to recover the amount of an accident insurance policy issued by the defendant to Frederick B. Mahoney dated January 4, 1926, and renewed January 4, 1927. The policy was made payable to the plaintiff, Ellen A. Mahoney, a sister of the insured.\n\u201cOn the 17th day of August, 1927, the insured, Frederick B. Mahoney, was accidentally injured by being caught and crushed between two railway cars at Calhoun\u2019s Mills, Westmorland County, New Brunswick, and the injuries sustained by him resulted in his death on August 30, 1927. \u201cThe application for the insurance policy, which is stated to form part of the policy, contains the following warranties:\n7. My occupation and specific duties are fully described as President and General Manager of Lumber Company, office duty only and travelling.\n8. I understand the classification of risks and agree to have my occupation classed as Select, and I further agree that for any injury received by me while engaged in any occupation or exposure to danger classed by the Company as more hazardous than that above stated, I shall be entitled to recover only such amount as the premium paid by me would purchase at the rates fixed for such increased hazard.\n\u201cThe policy also contained the following amongst other conditions:\n(2) If the injury is sustained by (or sickness happens to) the insured while engaged either temporarily, casually or permanently in an occupation classed as more hazardous than that stated herein (other than as provided for injury in Section G), liability hereunder shall be limited to such amount as the premium paid would have purchased for the increased hazard according to the Company\u2019s table of rates and classification of risks last filed by the Company, with the Superintendent of Insurance; Provided, that the performance of ordinary duties about his residence or while engaged in recreation shall not be regarded as a change of occupation.\n(The qualifications in Section G are not at present material.)\n* * * *\n\u201cFrederick B. Mahoney was the President and General Manager of P. G. Mahoney, Limited, a lumber company having a mill at Calhoun\u2019s Mills, Westmorland County. The accident occurred in the mill yard of P. G. Mahoney, Limited.\n\u201cA blue print (in evidence) shows a small railway or trolley track in front and to the east of the mill. Farther to the east is a railway designated on the plan \u2018Loading Siding.\u2019 and between the two is a piling ground for lumber. To the east of the loading siding is the main line of the Canadian National Railway running from Moncton southwesterly to Memramcook and Dorchester.\n\u201cThe mill was operated by one, Alfie T. LeBlanc, under a contract with the Mahoney Company, whereby he sawed the company\u2019s lumber in their mill and piled it out in the mill yard alongside the loading siding. The company sold the lumber, loaded it in cars and delivered it.\n\u201cOn August 17, 1927, there was a big rush on in the mill yard. It was the last day to get certain cars loaded for a steamer in St. John. LeBlanc tried to get men for Mahoney, the General Manager of the company, but could not get enough, so he closed down the mill and turned over his men to Mahoney.\n\u201cThe men were divided into three crews of about five each, one crew to a car. Three box cars were being loaded on the loading siding in the afternoon. This loading siding runs from Calhoun\u2019s Station on the main line through the piling ground to the south, past the warehouse marked on the plan and thence by a fairly steep grade across the highway road, and then in front of the mill to the end of the piling ground, where the siding ended.\n\u201cIt was customary when a car was loaded to move it down the siding by gravity. The movement of the car was controlled altogether by a hand brake operated by a wheel on the end of the car. There is a brakeman\u2019s platform three feet or more below the top of the car on which the brake-man stands to handle the wheel. When the brake is released, the car can be started and when loaded it requires careful braking to check the speed. Stewart Smith, one of the millmen, who was accustomed to handling cars, said it was necessary to be very careful to prevent injury to another car as there was quite a lot of grade.\n\u201cOn the day in question, one loaded car had been stopped about one car length south of the highway on the loading siding. Three other cars were being loaded above the highway on the loading siding. The one nearest the highway was in charge of George Mahoney, brother of Fred B. Mahoney. Shortly before four o\u2019clock this car started to move down the siding, got out of control and crashed into the car on the south side of the highway.\n\u201cFred Mahoney had been talking to Paul Bourque, his foreman, who was in charge of loading the car farthest to the north of the highway, about twenty or thirty minutes before the accident.\n\u201cLeon Bourque was at the bunk house behind the mill and saw the car moving down the grade with a man on the brakeman\u2019s platform trying to put the brake on.\n\u201cPhilias Richard heard the crash when he was in the mill and looking out, saw Mr. Mahoney on the ground with no one near him. He went out to pick up Mr. Mahoney and later told someone to blow the fire whistle. He asked Mahoney where he was hurt and Mahoney said, \u2018I got jammed between the cars.\u2019\n\u201cAlfie LeBlanc came up later while Mahoney was still lying on the ground near the junction of the cars, and, speaking to LeBlanc, Mahoney said,\u2014\u2019How near do the two boards come together?\u2019 and LeBlanc answered Mahoney\u2019s question,\u2014\u2019About eighteen inches.\u2019 When the cars come together, the evidence shows that the draw bars or springs in the couplings compressed to the extent of 4 or 5 inches on each car, which would bring the boards within 8 or 10 inches of each other when two cars came together.\n\u201cMahoney\u2019s pelvic bones were crushed and broken on both sides\u2014an injury which could only be accounted for by being crushed between two heavy bodies. The medical evidence did state that the injuries could be produced by a fall from a great height, but could not be sustained by a fall from the top of a box car.\n* * * *\n\u201cAs to classification of risks,\u2014these are found in the Company\u2019s Rate Book (Exhibit \u201cG\u201d) at pages 47 and 65. On page 47 the following classifications are found:\u2014\nLumber Dealer or Salesman not in yards or woods, office duties and travelling only is classed as Select.\n\u201cIt was under this classification that the insured was placed by the company.\n\u201cBy reference to page VI of the Rate Book, the premiums for the different classifications are found. Thus the premium for a \u2018Select\u2019 risk is $4. The premium for an \u2018Ordinary\u2019 risk is $7.50. The premium for a \u2018Special\u2019 risk is $12.50 and the premium for an \u2018Extra-Hazardous\u2019 risk is $20.\n\u201cOther classifications on page 47 are,\u2014\u2019Lumber Dealer, Loading, Piling or Delivering,\u2019 classified as \u2018Special.\u2019\n\u201cAlso, \u2018Lumber Mill Proprietor or Manager, superintending only,\u2019 classified as, \u2018Ordinary.\u2019\n\u201cOn page 65 of the Rate Book is found the classification of a railway brakeman, where the railway is operated by gravity:\u2014\u2019Brakeman, freight or mixed train,\u2019 classified as \u2018Extra-Hazardous.\u2019\n\u201cThe amount recoverable under this policy if the insured came under the classification \u2018Ordinary\u2019 would be $5,333.33. If his classification was \u2018Special,\u2019 the amount recoverable would be $3,200, and if \u2018Extra-Hazardous.\u2019 the amount recoverable would be $2,000.\n\u201cAll these amounts would be payable by instalments, consisting of an immediate payment of 10% and the balance in fifteen equal annual payments.\n\u201cThe questions to, and answers by, the jury are as follows:\n\u201cQuestions by the Court.\u2014\n\u2018Q. Did the deceased Fred. Mahoney die by accidental injury?\nA. Yes.\nQ. If so, was the deceased at, or immediately before, the time he received the injuries which caused his death, engaged in any occupation other than that which is stated in the policy, namely, President and General Manager of Lumber Company, office duty only and travelling?\nA. No.\nQ. If you answer \u201cYes\u201d, to number 2, then state what was such other occupation? A. (No answer).\nQ. What act or thing was deceased doing at the time he received the injury which caused his death?\nA. Not disclosed in evidence.\u2019\n\u201cQuestions by Defendant\u2019s Counsel.\u2014\n\u2018Q. Was the insured injured by being crushed between two box cars?\nA. Don\u2019t know.\nQ. Was the insured trying to engineer the movement of a box car at the time of the accident?\nA. Don\u2019t know.\nQ. Was the insured on a box car at the time of the accident?\nA. Don\u2019t know.\nQ. Was the insured at the time of the accident engaged in any exposure to danger more hazardous than office duty?\nA. No.\u2019\n\u201cUpon these answers judgment was given for the plaintiff (respondent) on the 9th day of November, 1928, for the sum of $1,048.47, and a declaration that the defendant (appellant) is liable to pay to the plaintiff (respondent) the further sum of $600 on the 20th day of November in each of the years 1928 to 1942 inclusive. \u201cThe defendant (appellant) appealed from the judgment to the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court which said appeal was on the 14th day of June, 1929, dismissed with costs.\n\u201cThe reasons for judgment of the Appeal Division were\ndelivered by Grimmer, J. for the Court.\u201d\n* * * *\nThe Appeal Division affirmed the conclusions of the jury as to the effect of the evidence upon all the questions of fact submitted to them except the first of the \u201cQuestions by Defendant\u2019 Counsel\u201d, to which they considered the answer, \u201cDon\u2019t know\u201d, perverse. We are agreed that that answer should have been \u201cYes\u201d; but, after a careful study, we are satisfied that it is not possible to say that the jury erred in deeming the evidence insufficient to justify its answering the fourth question put by the Court and the second and third questions of the defendant\u2019s counsel otherwise than as they did, i.e., \u201cNot disclosed in evidence\u201d; and, \u201cDon\u2019t know.\u201d\nTheir answers in the negative to the second question of the Court and to the last question of defendant\u2019s counsel may be read as meaning that the defendant had failed to prove that these questions should be answered in the affirmative.\nThe plaintiff having obtained a finding (not now challenged) that the assured had died \u201cby accidental injury\u201d, and the defendant having failed to establish the facts necessary to support its defence, that, when injured, the assured was \u201cengaged, either temporarily, casually or permanently, in an occupation classed as more hazardous than that stated herein\u201d, i.e., in the application incorporated in the policy, to be his occupation, viz., \u201cPresident and General Manager of Lumber Company, office duty only and travelling\u201d, it follows that judgment for the plaintiff, was the only possible outcome of the action.\nBut we think we should add, that had the jury been able to make an affirmative finding in answer to the second question of the defendant\u2019s counsel, the consequence would not be that there should have been judgment for the defendant. On the contrary, we are of the opinion that the doing of the single isolated act, which is all that such an answer would imply,\u2014it may have been in an emergency\u2014 and which ordinarily forms part of the duties of a more hazardous occupation, cannot be said to amount to \u201cengaging in\u201d such more hazardous occupation \u201ceither temporarily, casually or permanently\u201d. If the defendant company had meant so to provide, it easily could, and certainly should, have used terms which would have made that intention unmistakably clear.\nIf a specific exception to the risk undertaken in an insurance policy be described in the policy itself, as well as in the application therefor (although the latter be incorporated in the former), the assured is, we think, ordinarily justified in insisting, that, as between him and the Insurance Company, the words of the policy shall if they differ from those of the application, be taken as evidencing, in that particular, the contract by which both are bound. And, where, as here, the terms employed in the policy are reasonably susceptible of a construction which does not include in the exception, stipulated by the Insurance Company in its own interest, the doing of an isolated act of extra hazard, such as we shall assume the evidence here, viewed most favourably for the defendant, might have been found to establish, that construction must prevail. Ontario Metal Products Co. vs. Mutual Life Insurance Co. (1); Victory (R.M. of) vs. Saskatchewan Guarantee & Fidelity Co. (2).\nThe appeal fails and must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Sanford, Harrison & Anglin.\nSolicitor for the respondent: E. A. Reilly.\n",

(Claimants) Respondents.\n1929: November 13.\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Newcombe, Rinfret and Lamont JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nInterest\u2014Disallowance of, in fixing compensation for ship requisitioned by Crown under War Measures Act, 1914 (D.)\u2014Governing principles as to allowance of interest.\nThe Crown, in April, 1918, pursuant to Order in Council passed under the War Measures Act, 1914, requisitioned the respondents\u2019 ship. The Exchequer Court of Canada ([1928] Ex. C.R., 149) fixed the compensation at $11,000 (as being the ship\u2019s value at time of requisition) with interest thereon from date of requisition to date of judgment.\nThe Crown appealed against the allowance of interest.\nHeld: The allowance for interest should be set aside. The right to interest does not depend on the income earning capacity of the property requisitioned. Where interest is allowed, it is on the ground of express or implied contract or by virtue of a statute; and no such ground existed here (the case was distinguishable from those where interest is allowed on value of land expropriated). Interest was really asked for here as damages for detention of the compensation money pending the ascertainment of what was due; and as such it could not be recovered.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada (Audette J.)[1], upon a reference under s. 7 of the War Measures Act, 1914 (Dom.), fixing the compensation to be paid by the Crown for the requisition of the respondents\u2019 steamship Sarnor; which requisition was made by the Canadian Government on April 25, 1918, pursuant to an Order in Council passed by virtue of the said Act. The judgment appealed from fixed the compensation at $11,000 (as being the value of the ship at the time of requisition) with interest thereon, at the rate of 5% per annum, from April 25, 1918 (the date of requisition) to the date of judgment.\nThe appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was limited to the question of said allowance of interest, the Crown contending that interest was not allowable.\nO. M. Biggar, K.C., for the appellant, submitted that the question was concluded in appellant\u2019s favour by Canadian Drug Co. v. Board of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council[2] and Swift & Co. v. Board of Trade[3].\nW. F. Chipman, K.C., and Christopher C. Robinson, K.C., for the respondents, submitted that the question was whether there was anything to prevent the court from awarding interest as part of the compensation; that the principle which was applied to cases of expropriation of land (as to which see Inglewood Pulp & Paper Co. v. New Brunswick Electric Power Commission[4], and Seabord Air Line Ry. Co. v. United States[5]) is applicable also to a ship; and that the case of goods (as in Swift & Co. v. Board of Trade[6]), where the only ground for claiming interest is that the claimant has been kept out of his money, is not analogous; a ship, like land, is income earning property; the expropriator is both in possession of the ship and in receipt of the earnings, and the former owner is deprived of both; the reasons for awarding interest in the case of land exist equally in the case of a ship, and, since there is no statutory provision to prevent it, the same rule should be applied.\nO. M. Biggar, K.C., for the appellant,\nW. F. Chipman, K.C., and Christopher C. Robinson, K.C., for the respondents,\nNewcombe J., in the course of the argument, referred to Maine & New Brunswick Electrical Power Co. Ltd. v. Hart[7].\nUpon the conclusion of the argument, the judgment of the Court was delivered orally by\nAnglin C.J.C.\u2014We are all of the opinion that the appeal must succeed. The allowance for interest will be set aside. Otherwise, of course, the judgment below stands, there being no appeal as to the principal sum.\nThe right to interest does not depend on the income earning capacity of the property requisitioned. Where interest is allowed, it is on the ground of contract, express or implied, or by virtue of a statute. It is allowed on the purchase money of land which is the subject of a sale; or on the value of land which is the subject of expropriation under certain statutes\u2014but that is upon the ground of implied contract which is deemed to arise on the giving of \u201cnotice to treat.\u201d\nHere there is nothing of the kind. This is a case of appropriation of personal property. No provision is made for payment of interest. There is no case of implied contract; and the statute under which the requisition was made does not provide for interest.\nInterest is really asked for here as damages for detention of the compensation money pending the ascertainment of what is due. As such, it cannot be recovered.\nThe appeal is allowed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: O. M.

City of Winnipeg, [1930] S.C.R. 133\nDate: 1929-10-08\nDavid McKee and Elizabeth McKee (Plaintiffs) Appellants;\nand\nThe City of Winnipeg (Defendant) Respondent.\n1929: October 7, 8.\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Rinfret, Lamont and Smith JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR MANITOBA\nAppeal\u2014Jurisdiction\u2014Appellants, husband and wife, asking for restoration of judgment at trial for damages, awarded by separate amount to each, for injury to wife\u2014Separate causes of action\u2014Insufficiency of each amount to give jurisdiction to Supreme Court of Canada\u2014 Appeal quashed\u2014Special leave to appeal refused.\nPlaintiffs, husband and wife, sued for damages by reason of injury to the wife through her slipping on an icy sidewalk, owing, as alleged, to defendant\u2019s gross negligence. At trial, on the jury\u2019s findings, judgment was recovered against defendant, by the husband for $1,000, and by the wife for $1,500. This judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeal (38 Man. R. 1), which directed that the action be dismissed. Plaintiffs appealed to this Court, asking that the judgment at trial be restored.\nHeld: The appeal must be quashed for want of jurisdiction. In the statement of claim the claims of the two plaintiffs were distinct, the husband claiming in respect of loss personal to him only, and the wife in respect of her personal loss. There were two separate causes of action, though in respect of the same tort (Admiralty Commissioners v. SS. Amerika, [1917] A.C. 38, at pp. 54-55, referred to). The judgment at trial, now sought to be restored, while in form only one judgment, was in substance and effect two judgments; and the amount awarded to each plaintiff must be looked at separately to determine, in each case, as to its sufficiency to give jurisdiction to this Court.\nQuaere as to the case (the present case was not one) of a joint action in which the husband claimed on behalf of himself and his wife.\nApplication to this Court for special leave to appeal (special leave had been refused by the Court below) was refused.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiffs from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1], which reversed the judgment of Kilgour J. (on the verdict of a jury) for recovery of damages against the defendant.\nThe plaintiffs were husband and wife. By paragraph 2 of the statement of claim it was alleged that the plaintiff Elizabeth McKee, while walking on a sidewalk in the city of Winnipeg, and owing to the gross negligence of the defendant, slipped on the sidewalk, which was covered with ice and snow, and was thrown violently to the ground. Paragraphs 3 and 4 set out her injuries and sufferings. Paragraphs 5, 6, 7 and 8 set out the alleged condition of the sidewalk and the alleged gross negligence of the defendant in respect thereof. By paragraph 9 it was alleged that\nBy reason of the said accident the plaintiff David McKee was deprived of and will lose the comfort, society, assistance and service of his wife and was obliged to pay hospital bills, to employ a nurse and a servant, and will in future be obliged to pay a nurse and a servant, and has incurred and will incur expenses and liability for medical, surgical, nursing and other attendance for his wife and has been and will be put to further and other expenses.\nParagraph 10 gave the \u201cparticulars of the present and estimated loss, expenses and liability incurred by the plaintiffs\u201d in an itemized list, including hospital bill, ambulance, medical attendance, nurse, housekeeper, etc., totalling $1,046.25. Paragraph 11 dealt with the notice to the City of the accident.\nThe prayer for relief claimed\n(a) [Declaration with regard to notice given defendant of the accident.]\n(b) Special damages in the amount of $1,046.25;\n(c) For the plaintiff Elizabeth McKee general damages in the sum of $25,000;\n(d) For the plaintiff David McKee general damages in the sum of $2,000;\n(e) The costs of this action;\n(\u0192) Such further and other relief as the nature of the case may require or as to this Honourable Court may seem meet.\nThe jury found that the accident was attributable to gross negligence on the part of the City, and, on the questions as to damages, answered as follows:\n4. In what amounts do you assess damages? (a) For the male plaintiff? Answer: One thousand dollars.\n(b) For the female plaintiff? Answer: Fifteen hundred dollars.\nJudgment was entered for the plaintiffs in accordance with said verdict, with costs of suit, and it was adjudged\nthat the plaintiff David McKee recover against the defendant one thousand dollars ($1,000) and the plaintiff Elizabeth McKee recover against the defendant fifteen hundred dollars ($1,500), and that the said plaintiffs recover against the defendant their costs of suit * * *.\nThe defendant appealed to the Court of Appeal, which held[2] that, on the evidence and the law, the jury were not justified in finding the defendant guilty of gross negligence, and that it was not liable. The defendant\u2019s appeal was allowed and the action dismissed. The plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, and asked that the verdict of the jury and the judgment thereon in favour of the plaintiffs be restored.\nW. N. Tilley K.C. for the appellants.\nJ. Preudhomme K.C. for the respondent.\nAt the opening of the argument the Court raised the question of its jurisdiction, and argument was heard upon this point, the appellants\u2019 counsel also asking for special leave to appeal (special leave to appeal to this Court had been refused by the Court of Appeal, as stated infra, in the judgment now reported). Judgment on these questions was reserved, and at the opening of Court on the following day the judgment of the Court was orally delivered by\nAnglin C.J.C.\u2014As to the case of McKee v. The City of Winnipeg, which was partly heard yesterday afternoon\u2014 on the question of jurisdiction (raised by the Court) and on an application for special leave to appeal\u2014the Court is now prepared to dispose of it, having had an opportunity to consider it overnight.\nIn this action,-David McKee and Elizabeth McKee are both plaintiffs, the latter being the wife of the former.\nThe statement of claim sets out the circumstances of the accident which happened to Mrs. McKee, and goes on to specify her injuries and sufferings, etc., as the result of the fall which she sustained; then the 9th paragraph sets out, as the basis of the claim of the male plaintiff, loss of comfort, society, assistance and services of his wife, and expenses for hospital bills, nurse, servant, medical attendance for her, etc.\nWhen we come to the prayer for relief, we find that both plaintiffs claim special damages in the amount of $1,046.25, being the total of the items for hospital and other expenses incurred stated in paragraph 9, as particularized in paragraph 10. Then the prayer proceeds \u201cFor the plaintiff Elizabeth McKee general damages in the sum of $25,000,\u201d and \u201cFor the plaintiff David McKee general damages in the sum of $2,000.\u201d\nSo that in the statement of claim it is made quite apparent that the claims of the two plaintiffs are distinct. David McKee claims in respect of loss personal to him only; and his wife claims in respect of her personal loss.\nOn that state of the pleadings the case went to trial, and the jury brought in a verdict for both plaintiffs for damages, awarding to the male plaintiff\u2014very apparently on his claim as set out in paragraph 9\u2014the sum of $1,000 and to the female plaintiff the sum of $1,500, on her claim for general damages.\nIt is quite obvious that neither award is enough to give jurisdiction to this Court, the appellants\u2019 claim here being to have these awards, which were set aside in the Court of Appeal, restored.\nIn that state of affairs, application was made to the Court below for special leave to appeal to this Court, which was refused on two grounds:\n(1) That leave was unnecessary, as over $2,000 was involved;\n(2) That, in any event, there was no matter of public interest involved which would justify such leave being given.\nIn the refusal on the second ground we entirely concur.\nAs to the first ground\u2014not only the verdict, as I have stated, but the judgment based on that verdict provides that the several damages respectively found by the jury be recovered by each plaintiff, and is, in effect, two judgments in one. While in form there is only one judgment, we must get at the substance of the matter; and if, in substance, there are two judgments, we must look, as has been frequently decided, at each separately and each appellant must have had judgment for an amount sufficient to give jurisdiction here, when they ask to have such judgments restored.\nA joint action in which the husband claimed on behalf of himself and his wife is conceivable; and if such a case were before us it might require careful consideration. Mr. Tilley ingeniously argued that we have here such a case. But that is not the case here. There are two separate causes of action, though in respect of the same tort. Admiralty Commissioners v. SS. Amerika[3]. One thousand dollars was recovered by one claimant and fifteen hundred by the other; and that is the judgment they would have restored.\nCounsel for the respondent stated at bar that he had on the application for special leave below, taken the objection to the jurisdiction of this Court which I have stated. He may have done so; but he failed to take that ground here, in his factum or otherwise. As he might have moved to quash the appeal, so the appellant might have moved to affirm jurisdiction. Either motion would have obviated great expense.\nUnder all the circumstances, the appeal must be quashed and there will be no order as to costs.\nThe application for leave to appeal will also be refused without costs.\nAppeal quashed.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Anderson, Guy, Chappell & Turner.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Jules Preudhomme.\n[1] 38 Man.

Clarke (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nCity of Edmonton (Defendant) Respondent\nand\nAttorney-General of Canada (Intervenant) Respondent\n1929: April 26, 29; 1929: November 4.\nPresent: \u2014 Duff, Newcombe, Rinfret, Lamont and Smith JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA\nAccretion\u2014Bench formed by action of water at river bank claimed by riparian owner\u2014Whether bench still part of river bed\u2014Whether true accretion\u2014Formation in a \"gradual and imperceptible manner\"\u2014 Ownership of river bed\u2014Alberta law as to accretion\u2014Boundary of land at the river\u2014Construction of title and plan\u2014Part of original river bank still visible above bench; effect thereof as to rule of accretion applying. Plaintiff, as riparian owner, claimed as an accretion to his land (in Edmonton, Alberta) a bench which, through action of the water of the North Saskatchewan river in depositing sand, silt, etc., had accumulated against and permanently united with the bank at the river, and he sued defendant city for damages for trespass thereon. Held (1) On the evidence as to the nature of the soil and vegetation on the bench, it no longer formed part of the river bed. Criteria for determining what is and what is not the bed of a river discussed.\n(2) The bench (on the evidence as to manner of its formation) was a true accretion. (What constitutes an accretion discussed). The fact that the bench was formed in 15 years or less was not inconsistent with the view that it was formed in a \"gradual and imperceptible\" manner. Also, there may be a true accretion notwithstanding that after a flood it can be ascertained by measurement or even: observed by visual examination that a few inches, or even a few feet, have been added laterally to the border line. The test is, not the number of years it took the bench to form, nor yet whether an addition to the shore line may be apparent after each flood, but whether, taking into consideration all the incidents contributing to the addition, it properly comes within what was known to the Roman law as \"alluvion,\" which implies a gradual increment imperceptibly deposited, as distinguished from \"avulsion\" which implies a sudden and visible removal of a quantity of soil from one man's land to that of another, which may be followed and identified, or the sudden alteration of the river's channel. The rule that accretions must be \"gradual, slow and imperceptible\" only defines a test relative to the physical conditions of the place to which it is applied.\n(3) Assuming (but not deciding) that the common law presumption that a riparian owner owned the bed of a non-tidal but navigable river usque ad medium filum aquae was not incorporated into the law of the Territories (because not \"applicable\"\u2014i.e., suitable to the conditions existing\u2014within R.S.C., 1886, c. 50, s. 11), and that the Crown owned the bed of the river in question, yet the English law as to accretions did become the law of the Territories (its \"applicability\" discussed; the right to accretions from a navigable river does not depend upon the ownership of the bed thereof) and is the law of Alberta; and by that law (which was binding on the Crown) all accretions became the property of the riparian owner to whose land they attached.\n(4) Plaintiff's title gave him \"all that portion of\" lot 21 \"lying north of\" a certain road, and, upon construction of the plan with reference to which Crown patent of lot 21 had been issued, the northern boundary thereof was the river, i.e., the edge of the river bed. Assuming, on the evidence and admissions, that at one time the most northerly part of lot 21 comprised a steep bank to the foot of which the water came (but the line to which the water then came, wherever it was, and which then constituted the northern boundary of lot 21, had since been obliterated by deposit of sand and silt), the fact that the upper part of that old bank was still plainly visible above the bench did not prevent the rule as to accretions applying (Hindson v. Ashby, [1896] 2 Chy. 1, at p. 27, distinguished on the facts).\n(5) The bench, therefore, belonged to plaintiff, and he was entitled to damages for trespass thereon.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division, Alta. (23 Alta. L.R. 233) reversed.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta [1] which, affirming in the result the judgment of Tweedie J., held that the plaintiff was not entitled to a certain bench of land, claimed by him to have become part of his land by accretion, and in respect of which bench he had sued the defendant city for damages for trespass in depositing garbage thereon.\nBy direction of the Appellate Division, the Attorney-General of Canada was notified, and counsel for him appeared before it and presented argument.\nThe material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal to this Court was allowed with costs.\nG. H. Steer for the appellant.\nH. H. Parlee, K.C., for the respondent, the City of Edmonton.\nE. Lafleur, K.C., for the Attorney-General of Canada.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nLAMONT J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta (Beck, J.A. dissenting) [2]dismissing an appeal by the plaintiff from a judgment of Tweedie, J., in an action for damages for trespass to the plaintiff's land. The material facts are as follows:\u2014\nAbout the year 1920 the plaintiff purchased a piece of land on the south side of the North Saskatchewan river in the city of Edmonton and, on July 24, 1924, he became the registered owner thereof. This land is described in the plaintiff's certificate of title as\nAll that portion of River Lot Twenty-one (21) of the Edmonton Settlement, in the said Province, lying North of the North boundary of the Dowler Hill Road, as the said Road is shewn on Plan 7258X, of record in the Land Titles Office for this Land Registration District.\nPlan 7258X is a plan of subdivision of the northern part of Lot 21, and it shews Dowler Hill Road as running along the Saskatchewan river close to the river on the east side of the lot but not so close on the west. The plaintiff's land is, therefore, in the shape of a narrow triangle. It is a portion of what is known as Gallagher's Flats, which, as the evidence shews, are situated on what was formerly a part of the bed of the river, but which, years ago, was reclaimed therefrom. On the river side of the plaintiff's land at its western boundary there was, in 1910 when the land at that point was examined by Mr. Haddow, the defendant's engineer, a steep bank or slope 24\u00b77 feet high, the drop being made in a horizontal distance of twenty feet. It does not appear that Mr. Haddow measured any other part of the northern boundary of Lot 21, but it is not disputed that there was a bank along that boundary. At the time of Mr. Haddow's examination, the water's edge was 131 feet from the toe of the bank on an almost imperceptible slope which had a drop of only two and a half feet in that distance. Through the action of the water since 1910 there has accumulated against the bank and permanently united with it a ridge or bench comprised of soil, sand, silt and other substances. This bench is some 1,400 feet long and attains at one point a width of 80 feet. Near the western boundary of Lot 21 the top of this bench is 13 feet above the level of the water, but the bench gradually decreases in height until, near the eastern boundary, it is only some seven feet above the water level. On a portion of the bench toward its eastern end and covering an area 275 feet long by from 35 to 56 feet wide, the City of Edmonton had, since 1920, been depositing ashes and other garbage. In order to reach the bench the city's teams had to cross a portion of the land described in the plaintiff's certificate of title. In June, 1925, the plaintiff discovered for the first time as he says, that the city was depositing its garbage on the bench. He immediately interviewed the city authorities and claimed the bench as his own property on the ground that as riparian owner it constituted an accretion to his land. In September, 1925, he brought this action against the city, claiming damages for trespass to his property. The trial judge awarded the plaintiff $50 damages for trespass to the land included in his certificate of title which the city's teams had crossed, but dismissed that part of his action in which he claimed damages for trespass to the accretion or bench, holding, in effect, that the plaintiff did not own nor had he possession of the bench. From that dismissal the plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Division. That court, after hearing argument on behalf of both parties, considered that the Crown, as owner of the bed of the river, should be given an opportunity of being heard, and, consequently, directed notice to be served upon the Attorney-General of Canada. The Attorney-General intervened and was heard by his counsel. After argument the members of the court viewed the bench, examined its soil and vegetation, and unanimously came to the conclusion that the bench no longer constituted part of the river bed. The majority of the court, however, held that as the bench had been formed within the last twelve or fifteen years there could not have been, in this case, that gradual and imperceptible addition to the plaintiff's land in the ordinary course of the operations of nature which a true accretion requires. The majority of the court also seem to have been of the opinion that there could be no accretion in its true legal sense without the obliteration of the original boundary line and that in this case the original boundary line was still in existence and plainly visible. The plaintiff's appeal was, therefore, dismissed. From that dismissal the plaintiff now appeals to this court.\nTwo questions arise in this appeal: [3] Had the bench at the time the city dumped its garbage thereon become a true accretion, and [4] If so, had the plaintiff acquired the ownership thereof so as to enable him to maintain an action for trespass against the city?\n3 The matters to be considered in determining whether a given piece of land forms part of the bed of a river or has been wrested therefrom were stated by Homer, J. in Hindson v. Ashby 3 as follows:\u2014\nI think that the question whether any particular piece of land is or is not to be held part of the bed of a river at any particular spot, at any particular time, is one of fact, often of considerable difficulty, to be determined, not by any hard and fast rule, but by regarding all the material circumstances of the case, including the fluctuations to which the river has been and is subject, the nature of the land, and its growth and its user.\nHis Lordship also quoted the following passages from the judgment of Curtis, J., of the Supreme Court of the United States, in the case of Howard v. Ingersoll4, which he said were in accordance with English law on the point. Curtis, J., said:\u2014\nThe banks of a river are those elevations of land which confine the waters when they rise out of the bed; and the bed is that soil so usually covered by water as to be distinguishable from the banks, by the character of the soil, or vegetation, or both, produced by the common presence and action of flowing water. But neither the line of ordinary high-water mark, nor of ordinary low-water mark, nor of a middle stage of water, can be assumed as the line dividing the bed from the banks. This line is to be found by examining the bed and banks, and ascertaining where the presence and action of water are so common and usual, and so long continued in all ordinary years, as to mark upon the soil of the bed a character distinct from that of the banks, in respect to vegetation, as well as in respect to the nature of the soil itself. * * *\nBut in all cases the bed of a river is a natural object, and is to be sought for, not merely by the application of any abstract rules, but as other natural objects are sought for and found, by the distinctive appearances they present; the banks being fast land, on which vegetation appropriate to such land in the particular locality, grows wherever the bank is not too steep to permit such growth, and the bed being soil of a different character and having no vegetation, or only such as exists when commonly submerged in water.\nThe case of Hindson v. Ashby [5] was, on appeal, reversed on the facts[6], but the criteria laid down by Romer, J., for determining what is and what is not the bed of a river were approved by the Court of Appeal.\nThe bench in question was formed by the action of the waters of the river in depositing sand, silt and other substances, against the bank or slope on the north side of the plaintiff's land. This deposit kept increasing in height until it required an excessive flood to cover it with water. The bench is 13 feet high at the west or upstream end; 11 feet high where the garbage is dumped and some seven feet high at its eastern end, and it covers the lower part of the bank or slope to the extent of these varying heights. On its north or river side it is a cut bank dropping straight down to the water. The top of the steep slope which, prior to the formation of the bench, was popularly referred to as the \"south bank of the river\" is higher than the bench and stands out above it varying in height from 11 feet at the west end to from six to eight feet at the east. It is thus clearly visible above the bench for its whole length.\nAt the trial considerable evidence was given as to the nature of the soil of the bench; the character and extent of the vegetation thereon and the fluctuations to which the river was, and is, subject. This evidence, in my opinion, established that the soil of the bench was precisely of the same nature as the soil of Gallagher's Flats, which, admittedly, is upland, and that the vegetation of the bench was similar in character to that of the uplands to the south but much younger. Some vegetation on the bench shewed a growth of six or seven years, while on Gallagher's Flats the trees would require for their growth some 20 or 30 years. None of the vegetation on the bench was water vegetation. Mr. Haddow admitted that the soil and vegetation of the bench were of the same character as the land to the south, and further admitted that the westerly 30 or 40 feet of the bench had been wrested from the river and no longer constituted part of the river bed. But he contended that the part of the bench on which the city's garbage had been dumped was still under the influence of the river. On cross examination he gave the following testimony:\u2014\nQ. Your contention is that because this land is flooded two or three days during the summer, which is the longest period since 1915, that it is not wrested from the river?\nA. That is my contention exactly, that certainly is my sole contention.\nThe evidence of Mr. Pinder shews that in 1915 there was an excessive flood which covered not only the bench but Gallagher's Flats as well. In 1916 and 1917 the bench was flooded for a day each year. In 1918 and 1919 it was not flooded. In 1920 the water may have rested on the top of the bench for a day or two in May, but this is not certain. In 1921 and 1922 the bench was not flooded. In 1923 it was flooded for two days. In 1924 it was not flooded. In 1925 the flood was exceptional and for two days the waters covered the bench. The bench, therefore, is liable to be covered with water for a day or two in any year in which there is an exceptional flood. Taking the evidence as a whole, it, in my opinion, strongly supports the view that the bench no longer formed part of the river bed as the Appellate Division unanimously found.\nThe bench being no longer a part of the river bed the next consideration is, was it formed by that slow and gradual operation of the waters of the river in the course of nature which is necessary to the formation of a true accretion?\nWhat constitutes an accretion has received judicial consideration in many cases, among others, Attorney-General of Southern Nigeria v. John Holt & Co. (Liverpool) Ltd.[7]; Attorney-General v. McCarthy[8]; Rex v. Yarborough[9]; Foster v. Wright[10]; Brighton and Hove General Gas Company v. Hove Bungalows, Limited[11]; Trafford v. Thrower[12]. The result of the discussions may, I think, be stated as follows:\nThe term \"accretion\" denotes the increase which land bordering on a river or on the sea undergoes through the silting up of soil, sand or other substance, or the permanent retiral of the waters. This increase must be formed by a process so slow and gradual as to be, in a practical sense, imperceptible, by which is meant that the addition cannot be observed in its actual progress from moment to moment or from hour to hour, although, after a certain period, it can be observed that there has been a fresh addition to the shore line. The increase must also result from the action of the water in the ordinary course of the operations of nature and not from some unusual or unnatural action by which a considerable quantity of soil is suddenly swept from the land of one man and deposited on, or annexed to, the land of another.\nThe fact that the increase is brought about in whole or in part by the water, as the result of the employment of artificial means, does not prevent it from being a true accretion, provided the artificial means are employed lawfully and not with the intention of producing an accretion, for the doctrine of accretion applies to the result and not to the manner of its production. Stanley v. Perry[13]; Brighton and Hove General Gas Co. v. Hove Bungalows, Limited[14].\nThere was evidence that in 1925 a deposit of silt had been made on the bench amounting in places to a depth of six inches, as a result of that year's flood, and the test pit dug by Mr. Haddow gave indication of an equal or greater deposit in a former year. Whether or not this latter deposit was due to flood conditions or to imperceptible accumulation in the course of nature, or to a combination of both, we can only conjecture. It was, however, argued that such extensive deposits could not reasonably be said to have been gradual and imperceptible in their formation. What amount of alluvial matter might, by imperceptible deposit, be added to the plaintiff's land in any one year has not been disclosed by the evidence. Much, it seems to me, would depend upon the river itself, its volume, the rate of the current and how densely it was saturated with alluvial matter. But, although these conditions might influence the deposit of alluvial matter, the important question is: Was the formation of the deposit perceptible in its actual progress from moment to moment?\nIn his evidence Mr. Haddow said that the bench had been formed by sediment which had been deposited as a result of the slackening of the current, and that its slackening had been caused by the current being thrown out in the river towards the north, causing the water towards the south side to slacken. He explained what, in his opinion, had taken place, as follows:\u2014\nIn 1915 exceptionally heavy flood conditions occurred and there was about eighty or one hundred feet of the northerly end of River Lot 17 scoured away and washed completely down stream. This perhaps had the effect of opening out the channel so that the main flow would follow more nearly the centre or north side of the river, leaving the south side of the river adjoining River Lot 21 in comparatively quiet water, affording facilities for the deposit.\nMr. Pinder, a surveyor, who gave evidence for the plaintiff, on cross examination testified as follows:\nQ. Would you be safe in saying that there has been a new bank forming gradually from time to time?\nA. There has been a gradual alluvial deposit from year to year.\nQ. How long have you been out here?\nA. I came out in 1907.\nand Mr. Pearson, likewise a surveyor, said:\nQ. In what way, in your opinion, has that bench been built up?\nA. By silt from the river deposited in the course of high water.\nQ. Has it been built up in such a way, in your opinion, as to be perceptible from moment to moment?\nA. Not in my opinion.\nHe could not say, however, how gradually the accumulation had taken place.\nAnother surveyor, Mr. Belyea, who gave evidence for the city, stated that \"it had gradually grown up.\" The test pit disclosed that the deposit contained layers of alluvial matters of various thicknesses, one, at least, of which was 12 inches. But the time it took these layers to accumulate, whether months or years, we do not know. The proper inference to be drawn from all the evidence, in my opinion, is that for some 10 or 11 months in each year from the time the accumulation began until the bench had attained a considerable height, the sand and silt of the river was gradually and imperceptibly deposited against the steep bank or slope on the northern part of the plaintiff's land. Then for a few days or perhaps weeks flood conditions prevailed, during which an increased quantity of alluvial matter was brought down by the river. Much of this additional matter would, in all probability, be carried down by the current, but some of it, no doubt, would find a resting place upon the bench with the result that the deposit there at such time would be greater than if flood conditions had not existed. But even so, that does not prove that the deposit was perceptible in its actual progress, and the only evidence we have, in my opinion, points the other way. Neither can it affect the ownership of the deposit made gradually to the plaintiff's land during ten or eleven months in each year when there was an absence of flood conditions, for, as said by Gibson J. in Attorney-General v. McCarthy[15]:\neach insensible addition attaches to the principal land, and though in result, the aggregate of additions may shew a substantial enlargement of the original territory, that cannot displace retrospectively the ownership of the previous minute accruing accretions.\nIn other words, where the increase is imperceptible in its progress, that increase becomes the property of the owner to whose land it attaches as it is formed; it is vested in him de die in diem and no additional increase resulting from flood conditions can deprive the owner of the increase which had already vested in him. Flood conditions in the North Saskatchewan river must be expected every year when the summer sun or the rains melt the snows in the mountains through which the river has its course.\nThat the bench as it exists to-day was formed between the year 1910 and the date of the trial in 1925, in my opinion admits of no doubt. Mr. Haddow says it did not exist in 1910. The evidence of the plaintiff is that in 1920 it was in existence and was then very much as it is to-day. The test pit dug by Mr. Haddow shewed ashes\u2014presumably from the dump made by the city\u2014at a depth of three feet from the top. The bench therefore, at any rate except its upper three feet, was formed between 1910 and 1920. Where the city dumped its garbage the bench is 11 feet high. Does the fact that the lower eight feet of the bench was formed in ten years justify the conclusion that the accumulation must have been perceptible in its progress from moment to moment or from hour to hour during that time? With great deference I do not think it does. The river in its long course west of Edmonton is fed by a great many streams, these, in turn, except during the winter, are fed by innumerable rivulets of melted snow which flow down the sides of the mountains, each carrying with it some of the soil of the mountain down which it runs. This soil is borne to the river and is carried along by the current until it comes to a place where the current slackens, when it sinks to the bottom. The only evidence before us of a considerable quantity of soil being washed up by the sudden action of the waters of the river is that related by Mr. Haddow when he says, that in 1915 an unusual flood \"scoured away and washed completely down stream\" 80 or 100 feet of the point on Lot 17. Mr. Haddow's evidence however, is to the effect that the soil from this point was not deposited against the plaintiff's land, for he says that the bench was formed by sediment which had been deposited as a result of the slackening of the current. This itself was due to the fact that after the point had been washed away the current ran farther to the north leaving the water on the plaintiff's side quieter than before, and that this quiet water facilitated the deposit. The fact that the bench was formed in fifteen years, or less, is not, in my opinion, inconsistent with the evidence of the witnesses who gave it as their opinion that the formation of the bench had been gradual and had not been perceptible from moment to moment. The test, in my opinion, is not the number of years it took the bench to form, nor yet whether an addition to the shore line may be apparent after each flood, but whether, taking into consideration all the incidents contributing to the addition, it properly comes within what was known to the Roman law as \"alluvion\", which implies a gradual increment imperceptibly deposited, as distinguished from \"avulsion\", which implies a sudden and visible removal of a quantity of soil from one man's land to that of another, which may be followed and identified, or the sudden alteration of the river's channel.\nConsidering that in this case there is no evidence that the formation of the bench has been assisted by anything in the nature of an \"avulsion\", and considering that there is evidence pointing to its formation in a gradual and imperceptible manner; and, furthermore, that the additional alluvial matter deposited during flood time was only what was to be expected in the couse of nature, I agree with the late Mr. Justice Beck, who, in his able dissenting judgment said[16]:\u2014\nIt is far from enough to prevent a true accretion to be able to say that, for instance, after a flood it can be ascertained by measurement or even observed by visual examination that a few inches or even a few feet have been added laterally to the border line.\nThis view is in accord with what was laid down by the Privy Council in Secretary of State for India v. Raja of Vizianagaram[17], where their Lordships said:\u2014\nThe extent of the river and the operation of its currents in forming alluvial tracts during the flood season must be borne in mind with reference to questions arising in this case.\n* * * * *\nIn dealing with the great rivers in India and comparing them with the rivers in this country, it is necessary to bear in mind the comparative rapidity with which formations and additions take place in the former.\n* * * *\nTheir Lordships do not find it necessary * * * to discuss the exact meaning of the word \"imperceptible\" in the English rule which provides that all accretions must be \"gradual, slow and imperceptible,\" for assuming the applicability of the English rule, \"slow\" and \"imperceptible\" are only qualifications of the word \"gradual,\" and this word with its qualifications only defines a test relative to the conditions to which it is applied. In other words, the actual rate of progress necessary to satisfy the rule when used in connection with English rivers is not necessarily the same when applied to the rivers of India. The application of the rule is, in their Lordships' opinion, correctly laid down in the judgment of Ayling J. in the present case when he says: \"It seems to me the recognition of title by alluvial accretion is largely governed by the fact that the accretion is due to the normal action of physical forces; and the conditions of Indian and English rivers differ so much that what would be abnormal and almost miraculous in the latter is normal and commonplace in the former, as pointed out by their Lordships of the Privy Council in Srinath Roy v. Dinabandhu Sen[18].\"\nIn this latter case their Lordships point out that in proposing to apply the juristic rules of a distant time or country to the conditions of a particular place at the present day, regard must be had to the physical conditions to which the rule is to be adapted.\nThe bench being a true accretion the next question is, to whom did it belong?\nThe Saskatchewan river is admittedly non-tidal and navigable in fact. The Province of Alberta, through which it flows, was formerly a part of Rupert's Land, and the North Western Territory, which became a part of the Dominion of Canada on July 15, 1870. From that date they were under the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada.\nBy s. 3 of c. 25 of the Statutes of 1886 (s. 11 of the North West Territories Act, R.S.C. 1886, c. 50) the Parliament of Canada enacted as follows:\u2014\n11. Subject to the provisions of this Act, the laws of England relating to civil and criminal matters, as the same existed on the fifteenth day of July, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and seventy, shall be in force in the Territories, in so far as the same are applicable to the Territories. * * *\nThat Act was assented to by the Crown, so all the rights which the law of England applicable to the Territories gave to a subject as against the Crown in respect of the ownership of the bed of a river, and the accretions to its banks, were binding on the Crown in the North West Territories. The laws of England thus introduced included both the common law and the statutory enactments as far as either were applicable. By \"applicable\" here is meant suitable to the conditions existing in the Territories. It is, therefore, essential to ascertain what was the law of England on July 15, 1870, in respect of accretions to the land of a riparian owner bordering on a river non-tidal but navigable in fact.\nThe law of England, as stated by Coulson & Forbes, in Law of Waters, 4th ed., at pp. 77 and 91, is as follows:\u2014\nThe bed of all navigable rivers where the tide flows and reflows, and of all estuaries and arms of the sea is by law vested prima facie in the Crown. But this ownership of the Crown is for the benefit of the subject, and cannot be used in any way so as to derogate from or interfere with the right of navigation which belongs by law to the subjects of the realm, or the right of fishery, which is prim\u00e2 facie common to all.\n* * * * *\nAll rivers and streams above the flow and reflow of the tide are prim\u00e2 facie private, though many have become by immemorial user or by Act of Parliament subject to the public rights of navigation. There are two presumptions with regard to the ownership of the bed of non-tidal waters\u2014one, that the riparian owners own half the bed of the river usque ad medium filum aquae; the other, that the owner of the right of fishing in the river is owner of the soil, and this displaces the presumption that would otherwise arise in favour of the riparian owners being the owners of the bed of the river usque ad medium filum aquae.\nThe presumption that the riparian proprietor owned to the centre of the bed of all non-tidal waters applied to navigable as well as non-navigable rivers. Notwithstanding, however, that the bed of tidal waters was vested in the Crown and the bed of non-tidal waters was vested in the riparian proprietors, the law of England was that all accretions formed gradually and imperceptibly in the ordinary course of the natural operation of the water became the property of the owner of the land to which the accretion became attached, but if an accretion was the result of a sudden and considerable accumulation of soil, it could not be claimed by the riparian owner against whose land it accumulated. Blackstone, Vol. 2, at p. 262; Rex v. Yarborough[19].\nIn In re Hull and Selby Railway[20], the law as to accretions was held to apply alike to King and subject.\nIt was, however, argued that the common law presumption that a riparian proprietor owned the bed of a non-tidal but navigable river usque ad medium filum aquae did not become the law of the North West Territories because unsuitable to the conditions there existing, and reference was made to a number of cases including Keewatin Power Co. v. Kenora[21], in which the arguments and authorities on the point were exhaustively examined by my Lord the Chief Justice (then Anglin J.). In my opinion, it is not necessary in this case to pass upon that question, for, assuming against the plaintiff that the presumption was not incorporated into the law of the Territories and admitting that the Crown is the owner of the bed of the Saskatchewan River, the city has still to meet the law as to the ownership of accretions, which, as I have said, was, in England, binding on the Crown. If the law of England as to accretions was applicable to the Territories, then all accretions there became the property of the riparian owner to whose land they attached. The applicability of the law was challenged on the ground that the law depended for its vitality on the fact that the riparian proprietor was the owner of the bed of the river. In my opinion this is not so. The right to accretions is one of the riparian rights incident to all land bordering on the water. The rule is dependent, as set out in In re Hull & Selby Railway[22], on two principles: viz.,22 that that which cannot be perceived in its progress is taken to be as if it had never existed, and [23] the necessity for some such rule of law for the permanent protection and adjustment of property. That the right to accretions from a navigable river does not depend upon the ownership of the bed thereof is made clear in Lyon v. Fishmongers' Company23, where, at p. 683, Lord Selborne said:\u2014\nWith respect to the ownership of the bed of the river, this cannot be the natural foundation of riparian rights properly so called, because the word \"riparian\" is relative to the bank, and not the bed, of the stream; * * *\nIt was also urged that if the court held that the ad medium filum presumption of the common law was not applicable to fresh water conditions in the Territories, then, inasmuch as that presumption and the rule as to accretions had both been adopted from the civil law the court should hold the rule as to accretions also inapplicable. This contention is untenable. In enacting s. 11 Parliament was adopting the law of England as it actually existed irrespective of the sources from which it had been derived, and the only limitation placed on the adoption of that law was as to its applicability. In my opinion the English law as to accretions was applicable and became the law of the Territories.\nIn this connection it is interesting to note that in India, where a number of the rivers more nearly approximate in size and character to the North Saskatchewan than do those of England, the law applicable to accretions was laid down by the Privy Council in Sri Balsu Ramalaksmamma v. Collector of Godaveri District[24], as follows:\u2014\nThere does not appear to be in Madras, as in Bengal, an express law embodying the principle that gradual accretion enures to the land which attracts it; but the rule, though unwritten, is equally well established. There remains to consider only the argument that because some six or eight feet at the top of the old bank still stands out clear and visible above the bench, the rule as to accretions has no application. In support of the argument we were referred to the dictum of A. L. Smith L.J., in Hindson v. Ashby[25], where, at p. 27, His Lordship said:\u2014\nI very much doubt if the plaintiffs can invoke the doctrine of accretion as applying to a case where, as here, the old line of demarcation between the plaintiffs' land and the river has always been in existence and still remains patent for all to see. I allude to the old 6 ft. bank.\nThe argument as applied in the present case is, in my opinion, based upon a misconception as to what constituted the northern boundary of the plaintiff's land. His title gives him \"all that portion of River lot 21 * * * lying north of the north boundary of the Dowler Hill Road.\"\nThe patent of Lot 21 was issued by the Crown to George Donnell on June 26, 1887, and conveyed\nLot numbered twenty-one, in Edmonton Settlement aforesaid, as shown upon a map or plan of the said Settlement, signed by Andrew Russell, for the Surveyor General of Dominion Lands, dated 25th May, 1883, and of record in the Department of the Interior, containing by admeasurement, One Hundred and Sixty-three Acres, more or less.\nThis map or plan which is the only evidence we have as to the boundary of Lot 21, shews that lot to have been twenty chains in width and to have been bounded on the south by a surveyed road. The west boundary is also a surveyed road running in a northerly direction at right angles to the south boundary a distance of 82\u00b776 chains. The east boundary is parallel to the west boundary and is 79\u00b702 chains in length. Both the east and west boundary lines run to the line which marks the river and no other delimitation of the northern boundary of the lot is given. This boundary line must, therefore, be determined by the rules of law and the construction to be placed upon the plan. A plan of land abutting on a river which shews the east and west boundary lines of a lot as running northerly to the river line and having no defined northern boundary, is, in my opinion, to be construed as having the river (i.e., the edge of the river bed) for the northern boundary of such lot. If, on the survey of Lot 21, the east and west boundary lines had stopped short of the river bed, there would have been a piece of land between the northern limit of Lot 21 and the bed of the river, in which case it would have been necessary for the surveyor to define the northern boundary of Lot 21. Not having done so, the presumption, in my opinion, is that the river was intended to be the northern boundary. This was the opinion of Mr. Haddow, who, on being shewn Plan 7258X, gave it as his opinion that the Saskatchewan river was the northern boundary of Lot 21. This view is also in harmony with the instructions given by the Department of the Interior to surveyors for their guidance in surveying Dominion lands, as shewn by extracts from the Manual of Instructions put in evidence at the trial, and which, in part, read as follows:\u2014\n193. Land abutting on tidal waters is bounded by the line of ordinary high water. In the case of an inland lake or stream, the boundary, if the parcel does not include the bed, is the edge of the bed of the lake or stream which edge is called the bank.\nIt was not shewn that these or similar instructions were in force at the time Lot 21 was surveyed or the original plan prepared, but as their admissibility and applicability were not questioned at the trial and as they support the construction which the plan otherwise would bear, it seems not unreasonable that they should now be received as indicating the meaning which the surveyor who made the plan intended to convey. I am of opinion, therefore, that the northern boundary of Lot 21 as shewn on the Russell plan was the edge of the river bed. Where that edge was in 1883 we do not know. We have no evidence whatever as to its location before 1910 at which time the water was 131 feet from the toe of the bank on a slope which dropped only 2\u00bd feet in that distance. From 1910 to 1920 there is an absence of evidence as to where the edge was to be found. On the argument before the Appellate Division counsel for the plaintiff, as appears from the judgment of the learned Chief Justice, admitted\nthat the evidence established that at the time of the survey in 1883 and of the grant by the Crown in 1887, the northern boundary of the lot was a high steep bank to the foot of which the river came, and that such bank still exists as before, plainly visible.\nThe material part of this admission is that \"the northern boundary of the lot was a high steep bank\", that is that the bank and not the river constituted the boundary line. As, however, the learned Chief Justice in his judgment expresses the opinion that the admission was not intended in that sense, and as all parties knew that the evidence did not shew such to be the fact, I think we must conclude that all that the admission was intended and was understood to mean was that counsel for the plaintiff was willing to rest his case on the assumption that in 1883 the most northerly part of Lot 21 comprised a steep bank; that the water of the river came up to the foot of that bank, and that the upper part of that bank was still plainly visible. If it meant more than that it is contrary to the evidence. By that evidence it was clearly established that the only part of the bank still visible is the upper six or eight feet. Taking against the plaintiff the assumption here made, where was the edge of the river bed in 1883? Clearly it was not the top of the old bank nor yet its upper six or eight feet. It was the line at the foot to which the water came. That line, wherever it was, constituted the northern boundary of Lot 21. That line, however, was buried out of sight by eleven feet of sand and silt when the city dumped its garbage on the bench. This fact clearly distinguishes the case before us from Hindson v. Ashby[26], where it was established in evidence that the almost perpendicular six-foot bank there in question, to the foot of which the water came in 1803, still stood, and to the foot of which for a considerable part of the year the waters still came. The authorities on the question as to the application of the doctrine of accretion being conditional upon the non-existence of marks sufficient to distinguish the former water line, were reviewed by Pallas, C. B., in Attorney-General v. McCarthy[27], and he arrived at the conclusion that so long as the decision of the House of Lords in Gifford v. Yarborough [28] remains unchallenged, no lesser court is entitled to impose any such condition on its application. With this conclusion Romer J. in the Hove Bungalows case [29] agreed. As I have already pointed out, we are here not concerned with that question, because, not only has the edge of the river bed been obliterated, but also the most northerly part of Lot 21 to the extent of 11 feet up the slope. This slope or bank cannot be described as perpendicular, nor can its upper part be said to have been the edge of the river bed. I am, therefore, of opinion that the bench in question was a true accretion; that it attached to the plaintiff's land by gradual and imperceptible degrees and obliterated the former line of demarcation between his land and the water. The bench, therefore, belongs to him and he is entitled to maintain this action against the city for trespass thereon.\nAs to damages: These are difficult to fix. The plaintiff claims the sum it would take to have the garbage removed from the bench although some of it is now buried three feet in the sand. The necessity for its removal is claimed by the plaintiff upon the ground that unless removed it will interfere with his obtaining gravel from the bed of the river opposite the place on which it is dumped. During the five years that the city was dumping garbage on the bench the plaintiff did not have any permit to remove gravel from the river and, without a permit, he could not lawfully remove it, and it was only a few weeks before the trial that he obtained a permit. It was further established that while there may be gravel at a certain place in the river during one year, the river may, the next year, wash it away. Under all the circumstances, I think $500 would amply repay the plaintiff for the damages he suffered through the trespass by the city to the bench.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs here and below, the judgment set aside and judgment entered for the plaintiff for $500 and costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\n[1] 23 Alta.

Plaintiffs sued C. and A. for damages. Both the trial judge (Meredith C.J.C.P.) and the Appellate Division, Ont. (63 Ont. L.R. 257) took the view that A.\u2019s conduct after the collision did not amount to a novus actus interveniens, but was an involuntary outcome of the collision, and that the negligence which caused the collision was in law the cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injury. The trial judge held that A. and C. were each to blame for the collision; but the Appellate Division held that C. alone was to blame. C. and the plaintiffs appealed to this Court.\nHeld (1) C., who had violated s. 35 (1) (right of way) of the Highway Traffic Act (R.S.O. 1927, c. 251), was guilty of fault causing the collision, and was liable to plaintiffs. (2) A. was not to blame up to the moment of the collision; he was entitled to rely on C.\u2019s observing s. 35 (1), and when he became aware of C.\u2019s disregard thereof, it was not possible for him to avoid the collision.\n(3) If plaintiffs desired, there should be a new trial, confined to the question whether A. was, or was not, by reason of what occurred after the collision, responsible (jointly with C.) to plaintiffs. Anglin C.J.C. and Rinfret J. so held on the ground that, in view of the unsatisfactory nature of the evidence on the point, and in view of the reasons for its judgment by the Appellate Division, it was doubtful whether sufficient regard had been paid to s. 42 (1) (onus of proof) of the Highway Traffic Act, as it applied to the issue between A. and plaintiffs. Smith J. was of opinion that the finding below that A. was not guilty of negligence after the collision was a proper finding on the evidence (expressing the opinion, also, that if A. were held liable, C. could not also be held liable, because, A. not being in fault as to the collision, they were in no sense joint tort-feasors; A.\u2019s liability would have to be based on the fact that by his own independent act after he was, or should have been, free from the influence of the emergency, he, by negligent handling of his car, injured the plaintiff); that C. alone was responsible to plaintiffs, and the appeals should be dismissed; but, being alone in this opinion, he concurred in disposing of the case as proposed by Anglin C.J.C. and Rinfret J.\nPer Anglin C.J.C. and Rinfret J.: Subs. 1 of s. 42 of said Act is ex facie applicable to the case of persons in the position of the plaintiffs (Perusse v. Stafford, [1928] S.C.R. 416). Its application was not prevented by subs. 2, which excludes from the operation of subs. 1 only cases in which the loss or damage is sustained by an occupant of one of the motor vehicles in collision or by the owner thereof, or, possibly, also by the owner of property being carried in it at the time. (Moreau v. Rodrigue, Q.R. 29 K.B. 300). Therefore the \u201conus of proof\u201d was on A. to establish that the injury to the infant plaintiff \u201cdid not arise through (his) negligence or improper conduct.\u201d\nDuff and Lamont, JJ., dissented, holding that, on the evidence, the trial judge\u2019s finding that A. was partly to blame for the collision should not have been set aside; moreover, even assuming the contrary, A. was at fault in respect of his conduct after the collision; having undertaken to drive a motor car through a street frequented by pedestrians, he was bound, at his peril, so to conduct himself as not to expose them to unnecessary risk of harm by default in management of his car in respect of reasonable care, skill and self possession, whether in emergencies or ordinary circumstances; on the evidence, A.\u2019s manoeuvres after the collision were those of one who had \u201clost his head\u201d; there was nothing in the circumstances of the collision to have so deprived a reasonably competent driver of his mental equilibrium; that being so, A. had failed to acquit himself of the statutory onus of shewing that the infant plaintiff\u2019s injury was not due to any \u201cimproper conduct\u201d of his; to hold A. liable on this ground was not inconsistent with a judgment against C., who owed a duty to persons situated as was the infant plaintiff to anticipate such incidents as here occurred as the result of the collision (Scott\u2019s Trustees v. Moss. 17 S.C., 32, and other authorities referred to); plaintiffs should have judgment against both A. and C.; it was not a case for a new trial. APPEALS from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], which reversed in part the judgment of Meredith, C.J.C.P.1\nThe action arose out of an accident which occurred in the afternoon of October 6, 1927, at or near the intersection of Harbord and Borden streets, in the city of Toronto. The defendant Carter was driving a motor car westward on Harbord street, and the defendant Anderson was driving a motor car southward on Borden street. The cars collided at the intersection of the streets, and then Anderson\u2019s car struck and injured the infant plaintiff who was on the sidewalk near the south-west corner of the intersection. The plaintiffs (the infant plaintiff aforesaid and her father) sued both Carter and Anderson for damages.\nThe trial judge, Meredith, C.J.C.P.[2], held that the infant plaintiff\u2019s injury was caused by the negligence of each of the defendants, and that each of them was answerable for the damages; that Carter was guilty of negligence in breaking the statutory rule of the road giving the driver on the right-hand side the right of way; and that Anderson was guilty of negligence in carelessly making a left-hand turn against the traffic on such a street as Harbord street; that, seeing Carter\u2019s car and the danger, he should have stopped or taken some other means of avoiding the accident, even though he might have been in the right in regard to the right of way. He awarded $7,500 damages to the infant plaintiff, and $1,400 to the other plaintiff.\nThe plaintiffs appealed, and both defendants cross-appealed, to the Appellate Division; the plaintiffs on the ground that the damages allowed the infant plaintiff were inadequate; the defendant Anderson on the ground that the trial judge, having found that after the collision there was no negligence on his part which caused the plaintiff\u2019s damage, erred in holding that there was any negligence on his part which brought about the collision; and the defendant Carter on the ground that, admitting he was partly responsible for the collision, he was not responsible for the injury to the infant plaintiff; that the whole weight of evidence was that, after the collision, a new situation arose in which, if anybody, the defendant Anderson was severably and ultimately and solely negligent, as a result of which the infant plaintiff was injured.\nThe Appellate Division2 held that Anderson was not guilty of negligence causing the collision nor of negligence after the collision; that the collision was the result of Carter\u2019s negligence; and directed that the action be dismissed as against Anderson, that the plaintiffs recover damages against the defendant Carter, and that the infant plaintiff\u2019s damages be increased to the sum of $10,000.\nThe defendant Carter appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, claiming that he should not have been held liable to the plaintiffs, but that the defendant Anderson should have been held solely liable for the injuries and damages occasioned to the plaintiffs, and, in the alternative, and at the worst for the defendant Carter, the judgment of the trial judge should be restored. The plaintiffs also appealed, claiming that both defendants, and not Carter alone, should be held guilty of negligence, and that the action should not have been dismissed as against Anderson, as directed by the Appellate Division.\nD.L. McCarthy, K.C., and J.O. Plaxton for (defendant) appellant Carter.\nGideon Grant, K.C., and Ernest A. Harris for plaintiffs, appellants.\nT.N. Phelan, K.C., for respondent Anderson.\nThe judgment of Anglin C.J.C. and Rinfret J. was delivered by\nANGLIN C.J.C.\u2014A new trial in a case such as that now before us is always fraught with grave danger. As a result of the former trial and the hearing of appeals by a provincial appellate court and afterwards by this court, not only have the issues become crystallized and the difficulties arising from the course of the first trial been pointed out, but the points on which there seem to be lacunae in the evidence and the precise matters to which proof should be directed have been unavoidably emphasized in a way to bring them forcibly to the attention of the parties and their witnesses. The ordering of even a partial new trial, where, as here, the result must largely depend upon new or further evidence concerning a somewhat involved situation, should be resorted to only when the ends of justice clearly require it. But the trial of this action, which has already been had and which resulted in a judgment for the plaintiffs against both defendants, was, in my opinion, so unsatisfactory that a partial new trial is inevitable. The fact that in the Appellate Divisional Court the judgment against one of the defendants was set aside (Grant, J.A., dissenting) and his co-defendant was held solely responsible, unfortunately does not, under the circumstances, enable us to avoid this result. As is usual when a new trial is directed, we refrain from discussion of the facts and the evidence before us further than seems necessary to indicate the grounds on which we proceed.\nThe infant plaintiff, admittedly without any contributory negligence on her part, while standing on the side-walk on the south side of Harbord street, a little to the west of Borden street, in the city of Toronto, was struck by a motor vehicle driven by the defendant Anderson and seriously injured. This happened almost immediately after Anderson\u2019s car had been in collision with that of his co-defendant, Carter, at the intersection; and one of the questions presented for decision was whether Anderson\u2019s car being upon the Harbord street side-walk and hitting the infant plaintiff was a consequence of such collision, or was due to some act or omission on his part subsequent thereto which broke the causal connection between those occurrences and the collision, so that negligence which caused the collision could not be said to have been, in law, the cause of the infant plaintiff\u2019s injury. Both provincial courts have taken the view that Anderson\u2019s conduct subsequent to the collision did not amount to a novus actus interveniens, but was an involuntary outcome of the collision, for which, in the opinion of the trial court, he was jointly to blame with Carter, and, in the view taken by the appellate court, was not at all to blame. Both courts agreed that the negligence that caused the collision was, in law, the cause of the infant plaintiff\u2019s being injured.\nThe right of the plaintiffs to recover against one or both of the defendants is clear; indeed it is not seriously contested by either of them. The real issue is whether they are both liable and, if not, which of them is legally responsible.\nAn outstanding fact is that the defendant Carter was to blame for an admitted violation of s. 35 (1) of the Highway Traffic Act (R.S.O., 1927, c. 251) and was, therefore, guilty of fault causing the collision, either solely, or jointly with his co-defendant. Anderson, who had been found by the trial judge more to blame for the collision than Carter because of his failure to avoid the consequences of the latter\u2019s breach of s. 35 (1), was held not to have been at all at fault, up to the moment of the collision, by the Appellate Divisional Court, whose view was that he was entitled to rely upon Carter\u2019s observing the rule of the road laid down by s. 35 (1), and that, when he became aware of Carter\u2019s disregard of that rule, it was not possible for him to avoid the collision. In that view we respectfully agree.\nAs to the conclusion of the Appellate Divisional Court, however, that Anderson\u2019s subsequent conduct entailed no responsibility on his part, although the trial judge took the same view, we are not certain that in reaching it sufficient regard was paid to the provision of subs. 1 of s. 42 of the Highway Traffic Act, as it applied to the issue between Anderson and the plaintiffs. That subsection, in our opinion, is ex facie applicable to the case of persons in the position of the plaintiffs, who suffered loss or damage which \u201cresulted from a motor vehicle on the highway.\u201d Perusse v. Stafford[3]. That Anderson\u2019s vehicle was on the highway and that it was the instrument which immediately caused the infant plaintiff\u2019s injury are facts not in dispute. The application of subs. (1) of s. 42 is not prevented by the provision of subs. (2) which, in our opinion, excludes from the operation of subs. (1) only cases in which the loss or damage sued for is sustained by an occupant of one of the motor vehicles in collision or by the owner thereof, or, possibly, also by the owner of property being carried in it at the time. (Moreau v. Rodrique[4]). The result is that the \u201conus of proof\u201d was on Anderson to establish that the injury to the infant plaintiff \u201cdid not arise through (his) negligence or improper conduct\u201d; and, in our view, unless Anderson\u2019s subsequent conduct should be held to have been the sole cause of the injury to the plaintiff, a like onus would have rested on Carter as to his responsibility for the collision, had it been in issue. Having regard, however, to Carter\u2019s admission of a distinct violation of s. 35 (1), the only issue open on that branch of the case really was as to the concurrent responsibility of Anderson. That, as already stated, was, we think, properly determined in his favour by the Appellate Divisional Court.\nIn disposing of the issue as to the character and effect of Anderson\u2019s subsequent conduct, the learned Chief Justice of Ontario says:\nA moment before the impact Anderson discovered that a collision was imminent and at once turned his car towards his right. This was the only direction in which he could have turned with any chance of avoiding a collision and any reasonable person would have taken that chance. It is not improbable, though there is no evidence on the point, that, in the excitement caused by an impending accident, Anderson put his foot on the accelerator thus imparting additional speed to his car which when struck was within ten feet of the curb and mounted the sidewalk taking the course above set forth. Anderson had to deal with a serious and sudden emergency wherein human life was imperilled and his conduct must not be judged as in a case of voluntary negligence. Jones v. Boyce[5].\nWith the utmost respect, it would seem at least doubtful whether the \u201conus of proof\u201d as between him and the plaintiffs, cast on Anderson by s. 42 (1), is sufficiently met by the assumption \u201cthat in the excitement caused by an impending accident Anderson put his foot on the accelerator, etc.\u201d Had Anderson given this evidence at the trial, it may well be that it would be quite proper to accept his explanation of what occurred. But it is scarcely satisfactory, when, for one reason or another, he did not take advantage of his opportunity to testify at the trial, without any evidence to make such an important assumption in his favour. On the other hand, we are not prepared, on the evidence now before us\u2014more especially because it does not include testimony which, we think, should have been given at the trial by Anderson, whereas it contains extracts from his discovery evidence calculated to confuse rather than to elucidate the issue\u2014to say that the concurrent findings of the learned trial judge and of the appellate court acquitting Anderson of fault subsequent to the collision are so clearly erroneous that we would be justified in reversing them and holding Anderson responsible to the plaintiffs notwithstanding Carter\u2019s admitted initial negligence. Whether the intervening act of another person (Anderson) is an act of conscious volition amounting to a novus actus interveniens is often a very nice question. The following cases afford illustrations: S.S. Singleton Abbey v. S.S. Paludina[6]; Can. Pac. Ry. Co. v. Kelvin Shipping Co. Ltd.[7]; Harding v. Edwards et al.[8]; Admiralty Commissioners v. S.S. Volute[9]; Steele v. Belfast Corpn.[10]; Dominion Natural Gas Co. Ltd. v. Collins & Perkins[11]; Sullivan v. Creed[12]; Bull v. Mayor, etc., of Shoreditch[13]; Paterson v. Mayor, etc., of Blackburn[14]; Clark v. Chambers[15]; Burrows v. March Gas & Coke Co.[16]; Hughes v. Macfie et al., Abbott v. Macfie et al.[17]; Greenland v. Chaplin[18]; Louisville Auto Supply Co. v. Irvine[19].\nOn the whole case, therefore, we would, in the exercise of our discretion, order a new trial, if the plaintiffs so desire, merely to determine whether the defendant Anderson is jointly responsible with Carter for the damages sustained by the plaintiffs. These damages were increased by the Appellate Divisional Court, in the case of the infant plaintiff, from the $7,500 awarded at the trial to $10,000, and in this Court the correctness of this assessment was not controverted; nor was the quantum of the allowance of $1,400 made to the adult plaintiff challenged. The plaintiffs\u2019 right to recover from the defendant Carter being clear and the amount of damages awarded them not being questioned, we see no reason why those aspects of the case should be again tried out. The appeal of Carter will, accordingly, be dismissed.\nWe would, however, direct a new trial (if the plaintiffs elect to have it) confined to the question, whether the defendant Anderson is, or is not, by reason of what occurred after the collision, responsible to the plaintiffs, as well as his co-defendant Carter. The plaintiffs\u2019 election must be filed with the Registrar of this Court within 20 days, otherwise they will be taken to have abandoned their claim against Anderson.\nAs against the defendant Carter, the plaintiffs are clearly entitled, in any event, to all their costs throughout. They are also entitled to the costs of their appeal to this Court against the defendant Anderson. Should they elect for a new trial as against Anderson, the disposition of all other costs as between them and him should be in the discretion of the judge who shall preside at the new trial. Should they not so elect, save in this Court and the Appellate Division, there will be no costs of the proceedings heretofore had as between Anderson and the plaintiffs, Anderson\u2019s costs in the Appellate Division being set off against the plaintiffs\u2019 costs here, and the judgment of the Appellate Divisional Court will be modified accordingly.\nThe judgment of Duff and Lamont JJ. (dissenting) was delivered by\nDUFF J.\u2014The learned trial judge took the view that Anderson and Carter were both in part responsible for the collision. In other words, that by the exercise of reasonable care Anderson could have avoided it, and that this absence of reasonable care contributed directly, together with Carter\u2019s fault in driving recklessly into a street intersection, in producing the collision. His language is this:\nI find that Anderson was guilty of negligence in carelessly making a left-hand turn against the traffic on such a street as Harbord street. I think it is a common law and common sense duty that no one should turn against the traffic without great care in such a place as that where this accident happened.\nAnderson saw Carter\u2019s car, he saw the danger, and ought to have stopped or taken some other means of avoiding the accident, even though he may have been in the right in regard to the right of way, because everyone must take reasonable care to avoid injury by another even if that other is in the wrong.\nIn support of these findings there is a substantial body of evidence. There is the evidence of Long:\nQ. Apparently Carter was turning off to his left to avoid Anderson at the time they touched, is that right?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. And Harbord street to your right-hand side and to the right-hand side of Anderson was entirely free from traffic, wasn\u2019t it?\u2014A. Yes. Q. He had the whole street to turn off to the right and avoid Carter?\nHis LORDSHIP: The whole intersection was free I understand at all times?\u2014A. Yes.\nAnd there is Izon\u2019s statement:\nQ. I do not know whether you told me exactly which way the Anderson car was facing at the moment of the impact.\u2014A. I should say it was the southeast.\nMoreover, the considerations advanced by Grant, J.A., seem quite adequate to support the conclusion that Anderson, if he had been driving with proper circumspection, must have realized that, in proceeding as he did, he was incurring grave risk of a collision, if one accepts the testimony of the witnesses who speak to the facts mentioned by Grant, J.A., as the learned trial judge did. I cannot perceive any ground upon which this finding of the learned trial judge, whose province it was to evaluate the testimony of the witnesses, can be set aside or disregarded.\nAnderson himself refrained from giving evidence at the trial, and left uncontradicted the testimony upon which the learned trial judge and Grant, J.A., proceeded.\nIf I may say so with the greatest respect, I think the learned Chief Justice of Ontario was influenced by the testimony of Carter, in reaching the conclusion that Anderson was free from blame at this phase of the events preceding the disaster. Carter\u2019s evidence on discovery was not available either for or against Anderson. The controversy was not a controversy between Anderson and Carter.\nThis is sufficient to dispose of the appeal, but other aspects of the case seem to call for some further observations.\nAssuming Anderson to have been free from blame in his conduct antecedent to the collision, there appears to be no good reason for granting a new trial. First, there seems, in the evidence before us, to be no escape from the conclusion that Anderson\u2019s manoeuvres after the collision were those of a man who had lost his self-control and self-possession. The evidence of the two companions of the infant plaintiff is uncontradicted. Anderson\u2019s car, when they first noticed it, appeared to be headed south, down Borden street. Suddenly it turned to the west and was driven directly towards the group of three girls, who were standing on the sidewalk a few feet\u2014one says two and another six\u2014west of the Borden street kerb. The girls ran west as fast as they could, and one of them, Miss MacFarlane, narrowly escaped being struck down.\nQ. Did the car catch up to you?\u2014A. It touched the back of my leg every time I lifted it for two or three steps.\nAnother, Miss Hall, fell, but is unable to say whether she was struck by the car. The infant plaintiff was struck, she says, after she had run about six feet. So great was the force of the blow that there was \u201cconsiderable, I suppose it would be flesh\u201d on the bumper, according to one of the witnesses, Long, and some on the radiator; and moreover \u201cit\u201d (flesh) \u201cwas all on the road.\u201d The testimony on which these facts rest was not contradicted nor was there any cross-examination upon it. The full significance of them can only be appreciated when the evidence of Anderson, given on discovery, is looked at. Although it was evidently the middle of the bumper which struck the infant plaintiff, Anderson expressly states that he was not aware that she had been hit; and his evidence as a whole indicates clearly that he did not see the group of girls towards whom he was directing his car.\nHis own account is that his car was driven on to the sidewalk by the force of Carter\u2019s blow. This could not be reconciled with the condition of Anderson\u2019s car, or with the testimony of Miss Hall and Miss MacFarlane, and is explicitly denied by Izon, who was within a few yards of the place where the collision occurred, and who says that at that moment Anderson\u2019s car was facing south-east.\nAnderson attempts no explanation of his failure to apply his brakes or to continue down Borden street, which was the course on which Carter, who was behind him, proceeded. It seems probable that, in the mental confusion which supervened upon the collision, his own actions left no impression upon Anderson\u2019s memory.\nIf Anderson did not quite lose his head, his conduct in driving his car into a group of girls on the sidewalk, without so much as attempting to apply his brakes, would demand a severity of comment which would be indeed painful to utter. His reference to some small children, whom he says he tried to avoid by swerving his car, is beside the point; the plaintiff and her companions were at the extreme east of the sidewalk and must have been the first persons he encountered. Anderson owed a duty not only to persons using the carriage way, but to persons on the sidewalk as well. Such persons, everyone of them, had an independent right to be free from unnecessary molestation in their use of the King\u2019s highway; and Anderson\u2019s duty as the driver of a motor car\u2014his duty to such pedestrians\u2014was so to conduct himself as not to expose them to unnecessary risk of harm by default in the management of his car in respect of reasonable care, reasonable skill or reasonable self-possession, whether in emergencies or in ordinary circumstances. All this is involved in the proposition, that having assumed the responsibility of driving a motor car through a street frequented by pedestrians, he was under a duty to act reasonably with a view to the safety of such persons. If he was not a person of competent skill or competent self-command, he ought not to have attempted to drive a motor car in such a place. Having undertaken to do so, he was bound at his peril to exercise those qualities. If he did not, he is answerable in precisely the same way as if he had been driving a car, which he knew, or ought to have known, to be insufficiently equipped with brakes or other ordinary safety appliances.\nThere seems to have been nothing in the circumstances of the collision which would have so completely deprived a reasonably competent driver of his mental equilibrium. That being so, Anderson has failed to acquit himself of the onus resting upon him in virtue of the Ontario statute, of shewing that the injury to the infant plaintiff was not due to any \u201cimproper conduct\u201d of his.\nI do not agree that to hold Anderson liable is inconsistent with a judgment against Carter. Knowledge must be imputed to Carter, that collisions between automobiles in a public street are frequently attended by collateral incidents of an injurious, not to say destructive character, affecting third persons unconnected with either automobile. Such incidents may arise from various immediate causes. The machinery of a motor may become so deranged in consequence of such an accident, as to deprive the most competent driver of the control of his car; a car improperly equipped may for that reason be forced into some manoeuvre of a dangerous character; a driver may, as Anderson did, lose his head. Such incidents are to be anticipated and the driver of a motor car owes a duty to people using the same street (at least in the immediate vicinity) to anticipate them. The driver of the car (for example, with defective brakes) which is the immediate cause of the injury, may be responsible, but if what happened was something the negligent person responsible for the collision was under a duty to anticipate as the result of a collision, he also is liable.\nThe principle has been frequently applied. One of the most striking examples is Scott\u2019s Trustees v. Moss[20], where a person responsible for a balloon ascent was held liable for damage done to a cultivated field into which the balloon descended by the crowd which collected. The individuals constituting the crowd were, of course, themselves liable as trespassers. It is broadly stated by Lord Moulton in Rickards v. Lothian[21].\nThe present state of the law on this subject is, I think, fairly summarized in two well known text-books: 1st, in Clerk & Lindsell on Torts, 8th ed., at p. 133,\nIt is submitted that a voluntary act will be held to be new and independent, and the author of the prior wrongful act will thus be free from responsibility for the subsequent damage unless either he fails in carrying out a duty to foresee the possibility of the intervening act and guard against its consequences; or he authorizes or instigates it; or he is found by the Court to have intended the consequences which actually follow.\n2nd, in Mayne On Damages, 10th ed., at p. 42,\nThe Courts have not been consistent in the tests by which they have determined the limits of responsibility, and the law cannot be regarded as settled, but the present position may be summarized in three rules:\u2014\n(1) Damage is recoverable if, without intervening causes, it is the direct result of a wrongful act operating in the physical conditions existing at the time of the wrongful act, even although the conditions are peculiar conditions of which the wrongdoer had no knowledge, and the existence of which he would not reasonably anticipate.\n(2) Damage is recoverable if, despite intervening causes, it was intended by the wrongdoer as the consequence of his wrongful act.\n(3) Damage is recoverable if, despite intervening causes, it is the natural and probable result of the wrongful act, that is, a result which the wrongdoer contemplated or should have contemplated.\nTwo judgments of the Supreme Court of Massachusetts throw light upon the point, Leahy v. Standard Oil Co. of New York[22], and Meech v. Sewall[23].\nSecond, whatever view may be taken of the evidence as it stands, it is the duty of this Court to deal with the appeal by passing on that evidence. There has not at any stage of the case been any suggestion that any further evidence would be forthcoming at a new trial. Carter and Anderson both refrained from giving evidence; the plaintiffs, no doubt for good reasons, refrained from calling them as witnesses. All was done deliberately, there was nothing in the nature of surprise; nor has there been at any stage of the proceedings any complaint as to the conduct of the trial. In Brown v. Dean[24], Lord Loreburn, L.C., called attention to \u201cthe extreme value of the old doctrine, Interest rei publicae ut sit finis litium, remembering as we should that people who have means at their command are easily able to exhaust the resources of a poor antagonist.\u201d\nThe plaintiffs\u2019 appeal should be allowed, and Carter\u2019s appeal dismissed with costs to the plaintiffs in all the courts.\nSMITH J.\u2014I have gone over all the evidence bearing on the question of liability, which, to my mind, establishes beyond doubt that the defendant Carter was solely responsible for the collision between the two cars. His own examination for discovery read as evidence against him fully establishes this, even if accepted as absolutely correct. He says that he was approaching the intersection of Harbord and Borden streets when travelling, at 12 or 15 miles an hour, west, on the northerly part of the former, with his left wheel over the north rail of the northerly track of the street railway, that, when 30 or 40 feet from the easterly curb of Borden street, he saw Anderson\u2019s car coming south, pretty well on the west side of Borden street, at about the same distance from the northerly curb of Harbord street, going at about the same speed, and that he had him in view all the time up to the time of the impact, which he says occurred on the south tracks, a little to the west of the intersection. He further says that both increased their speed, and that there were no other vehicles ahead, on or approaching the intersection, which they had practically to themselves, and that they reached the intersection at practically the same time. On this statement Anderson had the right of way under the statute, and Carter says he increased his speed, instead, as the law re- quires, of yielding the right of way to Anderson. The excuse he gives is, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect any man would make a left-hand turn without seeing the coast was clear, especially on a through street\u201d. There is no evidence that either street was a through street where there was a legal obligation to stop before crossing, and the excuse amounts to nothing. These statements of Carter do not greatly differ from the evidence of Long, a teacher in the Technical School, who was driving in his car behind Anderson, and who is entirely disinterested, and whose evidence in some respects is stronger against Carter.\nHe says Anderson was travelling south on the west side of Borden street with his right wheels two or three feet from the curb at a little over eight miles per hour, and on approaching the north side of Harbord street he slowed down to about eight miles per hour, extending his left arm, and on reaching the north limit of Harbord street, accelerated his speed to 12 miles per hour and inclined slightly to the left, bringing the left of his car at the time of impact a little to the left of the centre line of Borden street, and pretty well over the south set of rails or between the two sets of rails. He says Carter was coming west along the north side of Harbord street at between 15 to 20 miles an hour when he first saw him, 40 or 50 feet to the east, and that he slowed down to about 15 miles per hour. First he says the two approached the intersection about the same time, but at page 35 [of the Appeal Case] he says Anderson\u2019s car got there first, and that the rear of Anderson\u2019s car would be about in line with the north side of Harbord street when Carter\u2019s was approximately 40 or 50 feet to the east, and that Carter turned to the southwest. If, as Carter says, he and Anderson reached the intersection about the same time, it was clearly his duty to yield the right of way to Anderson, and if, as Long says, Anderson had entered on the intersection when Carter was approximately 40 or 50 feet to the east, then Carter\u2019s fault was still greater.\nThe learned trial judge, however, finds that Anderson also \u201cwas guilty of negligence in carelessly making a left-hand turn against the traffic on such a street as Harbord street\u201d. I am unable to find any evidence to support this finding. Anderson, going at a moderate speed as all the evidence shows, slowed down on approaching the intersection, held out his left arm and inclined slightly towards the centre of the street, according to the uncontradicted evidence of Long. All this was the proper thing to do in order to make the left turn with due care, and he had no reason to anticipate that Carter, with this in full view, would disregard the rule of the road by attempting to pass in front. Anderson, in making a left turn, would not be making a turn against the traffic, as the learned judge puts it, had there been any. He would be crossing, as was his right, in front of west-bound traffic on Harbord street, and into and with east-bound traffic. There was, however, no other vehicular traffic on the intersection, and to say that it was Anderson\u2019s duty to take more care than he did is to say that he should have kept out of Carter\u2019s way when he had, in fact, a clear right over Carter to proceed, and a right to suppose that Carter would yield him that right.\nIf, therefore, Anderson is to be held guilty of any negligence, it must be negligence in control of his car after the collision, at a time when he should have been free from the influence of that collision to such an extent that with reasonable care under the circumstances suddenly and unexpectedly forced on him he could have controlled his car so as to avoid hitting the plaintiff. The line of the curb of Harbord street, according to the plan, is 13 feet south of the south rail, and Borden street from curb to curb is 24 feet wide. The collision took place on the south track a little west of the centre line of Borden street. From the front of Anderson\u2019s car southeast to the point of intersection of the two curbs shown on the plan would be about 15 feet, and from there to the hydrant is 32 feet 8 inches, making a total distance travelled by Anderson\u2019s car after the impact of about 47 feet 8 inches, or less if, as Carter says, the rear part of Anderson\u2019s car was hit on the south track, because in that case the front would be considerably past the south rail.\nAlexander, the brake tester, says that a driver with his mind set on making as quick a stop as possible, and with brakes working right at 20 miles per hour, should stop in 37 feet, and at 15 miles per hour, in 20 feet 8 inches. These tests, he says, are with a new car and brakes in perfect condition. The average car on the road, he says, stops in 50 to 55 feet, and Anderson\u2019s was better than the average car. Again he says, when prepared to act the average stop at 20 miles per hour is from 55 to 60 feet, and that in an emergency, and with his mind unprepared, a man would go further; how much further depending on the condition of brakes and the mental make-up of the man. He would expect a person confronted with a sudden emergency to go a considerable distance further.\nAnderson was certainly confronted with a sudden emergency. The witness Izon says (p. 46 of the case) that Anderson\u2019s car after the impact wobbled much in a very indefinite course towards the southwest corner. This was manifestly the direct result of the impact. His first thought, on seeing the other car about to hit him, would be to avoid the collision or lessen its force, and he naturally attempted to swerve to the right, away from the approaching car, as he says he did. He then receives the impact of the other car, which cuts through his running board and dints his rear door, causing his car to wobble in an indefinite course, as described by Izon. At the time of impact his mind is naturally centred on the car that is bearing down on him. Then he must recover control of the car\u2019s direction. Next he observes that he is heading for some children on the sidewalk and makes a move to avoid them which is successful, but which brings him in collision with the plaintiff, whom he had not seen, and the hydrant. At 15 miles per hour the car would go 22 feet in a second, and at 12 miles per hour, 17.60 feet, so that to recover from the effect of the emergency and make the necessary moves to avoid the accident to the plaintiff, he had at best three seconds of time.\nI agree with the remarks of the learned trial judge where he says,\nI am not able to say that in this emergency a driver of ordinary ability could have saved the situation. As I have often said, although there should be no need to say it, we are not to judge the driver in an emergency of that kind as if we were sitting in Court here quietly saying what he should and should not have done.\nA man licensed to drive must, of course, exercise in an emergency that degree of skill in controlling a car under the circumstances that a reasonably skilful holder of such a licence should exercise, but to hold that Anderson, under the circumstances of this case, should have, in the space of some 48 feet, and within three seconds from the emergency, have so fully recovered himself and the control of the car as to successfully steer clear of all the dangers that suddenly confronted him is, in my opinion, to cast upon him liability to exercise a degree of skill that the most skilful might have failed to command. It must be remembered too that Anderson should not be expected to exercise the high degree of skill that might be expected from a licenced professional chauffeur wholly employed in driving cars.\nIt is argued that Anderson should have put on his brakes, but that would not have saved the children in front of him on the sidewalk. He had instantly to get rid of the wobble and avoid the children. To seize the emergency brake he would have to let go the steering wheel with the right hand, when it was urgently needed on the wheel. He was suddenly, when in a perturbed state of mind produced by the collision, called on to make instantly several precautional movements. It is easy, as the learned trial judge observes, for us, sitting here quietly, with minds unperturbed by any emergency, to say that he could have applied at least his foot brake, but with the other things calling at the same moment for decision and action, within what part of the three seconds should he have had this brake on? On Anderson\u2019s evidence it is not likely that the application of the foot brake, at the earliest it could reasonably be expected to be applied, would have saved the plaintiff.\nMuch was said about the breaking of the hydrant, but as this is made of thin cast-iron, it would not stand much of an impact from a weight of one or one and a half tons.\nIf Anderson were to be held liable, it seems to me that Carter could not also be held liable, because, Anderson not being in fault as to the collision, they were in no sense joint tort\u2011feasors. Anderson\u2019s liability would have to be based on the fact that, by his own independent act after being free or after he should have been free from the influence of the emergency so far as control of his car was concerned, he, by negligent handling of his car, injured the plaintiff.\nThe learned trial judge held that Anderson was not guilty of negligence in the control of his car subsequent to the collision, and this finding of fact is concurred in by the Appellate Division, and should not, under these circum- stances, be lightly interfered with. My personal opinion is, as indicated above, that it was a proper finding on the evidence before the court. I am therefore of opinion that Carter alone is responsible to the plaintiff, and that the appeal should be dismissed with costs. However, as I am alone in this opinion, I concur in disposing of the case as proposed by the Chief Justice.\nAppeal of the defendant Carter dismissed with costs.\nAppeal of the plaintiffs allowed to the extent and on the terms set out in the judgment of the Chief Justice.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, appellants: Harris & Keachie.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant, Carter: Plaxton & Plaxton.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent, Anderson: Phelan & Richardson.\n[1] (1928) 63 Ont.

Rules 8 (d) of Order XVI, 12 (e) of Order XIII, 10A (1) of Order LI, of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, and R.S.N.S., 1923, c. 140 (Law and Transfer of Real Property Act), ss. 15, 16, 20, 24 (1), R.S.N.S., 1923, c. 144 (Registry Act), s. 18, and R.S.N.S., 5th series (1884), c. 123 (Act respecting Sale of Lands under Foreclosure of Mortgage), ss. 4, 6, considered. MOTION by the plaintiff for special leave to appeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc[1] affirming the judgment of Paton J. refusing an order for foreclosure and sale in the particular terms asked for by the plaintiff.\nThe action was commenced on January 7, 1929, for the foreclosure of a mortgage, made by the defendant and his wife to the plaintiff, of lands at North Sydney, in the County of Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, for $5,500, and for the sale of the lands described in the mortgage in payment of the amount due on the mortgage, and for the possession of said lands, and recovery of the amount due on the covenants in the mortgage from the defendant. No appearance was entered by the defendant, and on February 19, 1929, application was made ex parte to Paton J. in Chambers for an order for foreclosure and sale. The form of order asked for by the plaintiff was, in part, as follows:\u2014\nAnd it is further ordered that the equity of redemption of the defendant and of all persons claiming or entitled by, from or under the said defendant of, in and to the lands and premises sought to be foreclosed herein be barred and forever foreclosed.\nThat the said lands and premises be advertised for sale * * * And unless before the day appointed for such sale the amount due * * * be paid * * * the said land and premises be sold at public auction * * * to the highest or best bidder. And that upon payment of the purchase money the said sheriff do make a good and sufficient deed to the purchaser thereof.\n*****\nPaton J. refused to grant the order in the form asked for, the objection being that the order directed the sale of the land instead of the sale of the right, title and interest of the mortgagor in the land.\nSubsequently the plaintiff moved before the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc, for the order, under the provisions of Order LVII, Rule 10, of the Rules of the Supreme Court. The Court affirmed the decision of Paton J., and settled the form of order. The order as thus settled read, in part, as follows:\u2014\nAnd it is further ordered that the estate, interest and equity of redemption of the mortgagor in the said lands and premises described in the said mortgage be forever barred and foreclosed and that a sale of the said mortgaged premises be made by the sheriff * * * after notice\n* * * and unless before the day appointed for such sale the amount due to the plaintiff with its costs be paid to it or its solicitor the sheriff shall proceed to sell and shall execute to the purchaser or purchasers thereof at such sale a deed or deeds conveying and which shall convey to him or them all the estate right title interest claim property and demand of the mortgagor at the time of the making of the said mortgage foreclosed in this action, or at any time since, and of all persons claiming or entitled by from or under the mortgagor of in and to the lands respectively purchased at such sale.\n*****\nThe plaintiff applied to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc for special leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, which application was refused.\nThe plaintiff then moved before the Supreme Court of Canada for special leave to appeal, contending, inter alia, that the matter in controversy came within clauses (c), (d), and (f) of the proviso to s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act; that it was a matter of general public interest affecting the title to the great majority of real estate properties in the province of Nova Scotia; that it involved the substantial rights of the parties and was not merely a question of procedure and practice; that the judgment was erroneous in law; that the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia had no jurisdiction to make an order or decree for the sale merely of the estate, title and interest of the mortgagor in lands; that no court of equity will decree a sale merely of the estate, right, title and interest in land but must ascertain the interest to be sold; that the order or decree asked for by the plaintiff was the settled form of order or decree granted by the Court over a great period of years and could not now be changed; that the order sought to be appealed from purported to foreclose only the estate, interest and equity of redemption of the mortgagor in the land described in the mortgage, leaving unmentioned the interests of judgment creditors mentioned in the Registrar\u2019s certificates and all others claiming under the mortgagor whether equitably or otherwise and whether registered or unregistered; that the order sought to be appealed from purported to order a sale of \u201csaid mortgaged premises,\u201d which phrase had been construed by the judgment sought to be appealed from to mean only the \u201cright, title and interest\u201d of the mortgagor, and by said judgment plaintiffs in foreclosure suits who do not conform to the form settled and who advertise and sell more than such \u201cestate, title and interest\u201d are debarred from having their sales confirmed and their costs of advertising or sheriff\u2019s deed allowed; that a sale under the order would not carry the legal estate and title of the mortgagee and that a purchaser at such sale would take the mortgagor\u2019s estate and interest, if any, subject to all equities to which it was subject in his hands when the mortgage was made and subject to all encumbrances attaching thereto subsequent to the making of the mortgage whether registered or unregistered; that a purchaser would be unable to get a good title at the foreclosure sale, and the rights of the plaintiff and also of the defendant would be thereby prejudiced and the chance of holding a good sale destroyed, and that the titles of all properties hereafter sold in foreclosure actions pursuant to orders in the form fixed by the said judgment would be rendered defective; that it was important in the interests of the parties to the suit and of the owners of all real estate in the province and of mortgagees that the judgment of the highest court of appeal should be obtained as to whether, in actions for foreclosure and sale in Nova Scotia, the decree of the court should be for the sale of the land described in the mortgage or merely for the sale of the mortgagor\u2019s interest therein whether ascertained or unascertained, and also that the effect of the common form of decree for foreclosure and sale in use in the province should be determined.\nA. Whitman K.C. for the motion.\nNo one contra.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nAnglin, C. J. C.\u2014The plaintiff has moved for special leave to appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court en banc of Nova Scotia[2] affirming a judgment of Paton, J., refusing an order for foreclosure and sale in this action in the particular terms in which it was asked. The case appears to fall within one or more of the clauses of the proviso to s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act; and, although at first disposed to regard the questions raised as purely matters of procedure, which should not be made the subject of an appeal to this Court, on further consideration it appears to us that they may affect some substantive rights and that, even if mere matters of procedure, they are of such general importance in Nova Scotia that they may properly be considered and dealt with here.\nIn the judgment of the Full Court the terms of the order proper, in the opinion of that Court, to cover a case such as this are settled and embodied. The chief complaint made against this order is that it provides for the advertisement and sale only of the interest of the mortgagor and of persons claiming under and through him, instead of, as the plaintiff desires, providing for the advertisement and sale of the lands and premises in question simpliciter.\nThe contention put forward on behalf of the plaintiff, in this respect, is, in our opinion, entirely wrong. It never was, and never could be, the purpose of the legislation and rules governing the matter that the court should do anything so misleading as to authorize the advertisement and sale of anything more than the interest of the mortgagor at the time the mortgage was made and any interest subsequently acquired by him and the interests of all persons claiming by, through or under him, including, of course, the plaintiff itself.\nWhile we entirely agree with the view expressed by Chisholm, J., who dissented, that \u201ceither course\u201d (i.e., that directed by the Court en banc, or that urged by Mr. Whitman)\nleads at least to this result, namely that nothing more than the interest of the mortgagor is or can be conveyed to the purchaser at the Sheriff\u2019s sale.\nWe are also fully in accord with the observation of the learned Chief Justice that\nthe court will not and should not lend itself to any practice calculated to have the effect of deceiving unwary persons into believing that they were buying and getting something which they were not getting.\nRitchie, E. J., puts the matter very clearly in Diocesan Synod of Nova Scotia v. O\u2019Brien[3].\nOf course, as Chisholm, J., points out, the property is always sold and conveyed subject to paramount liens (if any) created by law (e.g., for taxes), whether they arose before or after the making of the mortgage, and the phrase, \u201cthe interest of the mortgagor at the time of the making of the mortgage\u201d must be so understood. Moreover, we agree with the learned Chief Justice that the court has full power and control * * * over the advertising (and) the form of the deed which its officer, the sheriff, is to execute\nOn the main ground of the plaintiff\u2019s appeal, therefore, we are of the opinion that the judgment below was clearly right and that special leave to appeal from it should not be granted.\nThere are, however, one or two subsidiary matters, not so much pressed at bar, but in regard to which slight improvements may, we think, be made in the wording of the order as settled by the Full Court.\nThe first paragraph of the order so settled reads as follows:\nIt is ordered that the estate, interest and equity of redemption of the Mortgagor in the said lands and premises described in the said Mortgage be forever barred and foreclosed * * *\nIn this sentence we think the word \u201cmortgagor\u201d an undesirable substitute for the word \u201cdefendant\u201d, which is the word used in the English form as given in Seton\u2019s Judgments and Orders (7th Ed.), at p. 1825. An advantage of using the word \u201cdefendant\u201d is that it makes more readily and obviously applicable the provisions of Rule 8 (d) of Order XVI of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, which reads:\n8 (d). It shall not be necessary to make beneficiaries or subsequent incumbrancers defendants, but the court or a judge may direct notice to be given to the beneficiaries or subsequent incumbrancers by mailing a notice of the order with a copy of the advertisement of the sale, and after such notice any such beneficiary or subsequent incumbrancer shall be bound by the proceedings in the same manner as if he had originally been made a party, and any person so notified may within one month thereafter apply to the court or a judge to discharge, vary or add to the said order, or for such other relief in the action as he is entitled to, and the court or a judge in addition to directing such notice to be given, may direct such proceedings as are necessary to protect the rights of the parties,*\nand of the statute c. 140, R.S.N.S., 1923, s. 24 (1), which is in the following terms:\n(24 (1) Where by reason of any of the rules of the Supreme Court, providing that it shall not be necessary in certain cases to make incumbrancers, beneficiaries, widows, devisees, or heirs, parties to actions for foreclosure and sale of mortgaged lands, such persons are not made parties, and such lands are sold in any such action, and a deed thereof executed, such deed shall be effective to convey to the grantee all the interest in the land so sold of all such incumbrancers, beneficiaries, widows, devisees, and heirs at law as if they had been parties to such action.\nPrior unregistered instruments are ineffective as against a registered purchaser for valuable consideration without notice at a sale under a subsequent registered mortgage. R.S.N.S., 1923, c. 144, s. 18.\nThe effect of the rule and statute quoted, when applied to an order such as that before us (the word \u201cdefendant\u201d being substituted for the word \u201cmortgagor\u201d), when served as prescribed by Rule 8 (d), clearly is to debar and foreclose the interests of all persons claiming by, through or under the mortgagor as well as of the mortgagor himself, who is the actual defendant.\nWith this verbal change, which we have no doubt would have been made by the Full Court had its attention been specifically drawn to the matter, the first clause of the order as settled seems unexceptionable. While in substance the same, it is, in our opinion, preferable to the clause suggested in the draft order, pressed for by counsel for the plaintiff, which reads:\nAnd it is further ordered that the equity of redemption of the defendant and of all persons claiming or entitled by, from or under the said defendant of, in and to the lands and premises sought to be foreclosed herein be barred and forever foreclosed.\nThe order settled by the court proceeds:\nThat a sale of the said mortgaged premises be made by the Sheriff of the County of Cape Breton.\nObjection is taken here to the term \u201cmortgaged premises,\u201d for which the plaintiff would substitute \u201cthe said lands and premises,\u201d i.e. \u201cthe lands and premises sought to be foreclosed herein.\u201d\nRule 12 (e) of Order XIII of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, dealing with foreclosure and sale proceedings, reads as follows:\n(e) The Court or judge may direct a sale of the property on such terms as the court or a judge thinks fit, and without previously determining the priorities of incumbrancers or the amount due on their incumbrances.\n\u201cThe property\u201d here, beyond doubt, means the interest which the mortgagor had in the lands immediately prior to the making of the mortgage sued upon, which alone could have been the subject of the mortgage\u2014and, possibly, also any further or other interest therein subsequently acquired by him. In his judgment the learned Chief Justice said:\u2014\u201cThe practice to-day is what it was immediately preceding the first of October, 1884;\u201d and he added that \u201cso far as sales are concerned it was continued by s. 6 of the statute to which reference has been made\u201d (c. 117, R.S.N.S. First Series, 1851; R.S.N.S. (1884) Fifth Series, c. 123, s. 6).\nOn reference to Rules Nos. 11 and 12 of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia brought into force on the 1st of October, 1884,* as set out in the R.S.N.S., 5th Series, 1884, at p. 833, we find that they read as follows:\n11. Where the action is in respect of a mortgage, and the plaintiff claims foreclosure or sale, or redemption, or where the action is for the administration of an estate, or for a partition, the plaintiff shall be entitled to a judgment on such evidence (if any) and in such cases (as nearly as may be) as provided for by the practice immediately preceding the first day of October, 1884, relative thereto.\n12. Where the action is for the foreclosure or redemption of a mortgage, or sale of mortgaged premises, if the plaintiff is not entitled to a judgment or would not according to the practice immediately preceding the first day of October, 1884, be entitled to such a judgment or order as he desires, he shall be entitled to the proper judgment or order, on notice or otherwise, according to the said practice where a cause is heard or on an order to take the Bill pro confesso or otherwise.\nThese rules seem not quite to provide that the practice in mortgage actions which was prevalent immediately prior to the 1st of October, 1884, shall continue in its entirety, but rather that the plaintiff shall be entitled to a judgment \u201con such evidence and in such cases as provided for by the practice immediately preceding\u201d that date. But, however that may be, it seems clear that, at all material times in the past, the property directed by the statute to be advertised and sold in Nova Scotia was not \u201cthe lands and premises\u201d but \u201cthe lands mortgaged\u201d (Vide: R.S.N.S., 5th Series (1884), c. 123, s. 4), i.e. the interest in the lands which had been mortgaged.\nBy the Rule of Court presently in force, however, above set forth, viz. Rule 12 (e) of Order XIII, the word \u201cproperty\u201d appears to be substituted for the word \u201clands\u201d in earlier use. In order, therefore, to conform more precisely to the terms of the present rule and at the same time clearly to restrict the subject matter of the advertisement and sale to the interests of the mortagee and of the mortgagor and those claiming by, through or under the latter, we would suggest the substitution in the paragraph of the order as settled by the Full Court of the words \u201cthe said mortgaged property\u201d for the words \u201cthe said mortgaged premises.\u201d Again, however, we are satisfied that this purely verbal change would have been sanctioned by the Full Court had it been suggested on the settlement of the minutes of the judgment of that Court.\nFinally, the form of order as settled by the Full Court directs that the sheriff\nshall execute to the purchaser or purchasers thereof (i.e. of the mortgaged property) at such sale a deed or deeds conveying and which shall convey to him or them all the estate, right, title, interest, claim, property and demand of the mortgagor at the time of the making of the said mortgage foreclosed in this action, or at any time since, and of all persons claiming or entitled by from or under the mortgagor of, in and to the lands respectively purchased at such sale.\nIn lieu of this provision the draft order prepared by the plaintiff, which it insists should be substituted for that settled by the Full Court, reads:\nAnd that upon payment of the purchase money the said sheriff do make a good and sufficient deed to the purchaser thereof.\ni.e., presumably, of \u201cthe lands and premises sought to be foreclosed.\u201d\nOrder LI of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, Rule 10A (1), reads as follows:\n10A (1). In an action for foreclosure and sale, if the order directs a sale in default of payment, the premises shall be sold upon such default in accordance with the advertisement of sale by the sheriff of the county in which the lands lie, or by such other person as is authorized by the court to make such sale, and such sheriff or person so authorized may execute the deed of the premises to be given to such purchaser.\nThe Law and Transfer of Real Property Act, c. 140 of the R.S.N.S., 1923, contains the following pertinent provisions:\nSection 15. Where an order is made, whether in court or in chambers, directing any land to be sold, the same shall be sold, unless the court or a judge otherwise orders, by the sheriff of the county in which the land or part of the land lies.\nSection 16: In every such case the deed shall be executed by the person authorized to make such sale, and such deed, when delivered to the purchaser, shall convey the land ordered to be sold.\nSection 20: Every deed of land made by any person authorized by the court or a judge to sell the same shall be presumptive evidence of,\n(a) the regularity of the sale,\n(b) the validity of the order under which the sale was made, and\n(c) the regularity of the proceedings on which such order was founded.\nSection 24 (1): Where by reason of any of the rules of the Supreme Court, providing that it shall not be necessary in certain cases to make incumbrancers, beneficiaries, widows, devisees, or heirs, parties to actions for foreclosure and sale of mortgaged lands, such persons are not made parties, and such lands are sold in any such action, and a deed thereof executed, such deed shall be effective to convey to the grantee all the interest in the land so sold of all such incumbrancers, beneficiaries, widows, devisees, and heirs at law as if they had been parties to such action.\nThe effect of these several provisions is, no doubt, to make the sheriff\u2019s deed \u201cconvey(ing) the land ordered to be sold\u201d (s. 16) operate to convey \u201call the estate etc.\u201d mentioned in the form of order as settled by the Full Court, and it was apparently unnecessary to do more in that order than to direct that the sheriff should execute to the purchaser or purchasers a deed or deeds conveying \u201cthe property\u201d or \u201cthe premises\u201d directed to be sold. Expressio eorum quae tacite insunt nihil operatur. But no possible harm or prejudice can accrue to anybody from setting forth, as is done in the settled order, that which the statutes say shall be the effect of the deed or deeds executed by the sheriff. Abundans cautela non nocet. Moreover, while the words explanatory of the estate etc. to be conveyed may be regarded as clausula inutilis in their immediate collocation, they may affect the construction of earlier clauses which order foreclosure, advertisement and sale and, occurring where they do, they seem apt to declare and confirm the title acquired by the purchaser and also to remove any doubt that might affect the mind of anybody not learned in the law. 4 Co. Rep., 73b; Littleton\u2019s Tenures, s. 331. In order to comply more precisely, however, with the terms of the rules of court and the statutes governing, we think it better that a slight modification should be made in the form of order as settled by the Full Court by inserting after the words \u201cshall convey to him or them\u201d the words \u201cthe mortgaged property, and which shall be effective to convey\u201d (Vide: R.S.N.S. (1923), c. 140, s. 24 (1), and R.S.N.S., 5th Series (1884), c. 123, s. 6.)\nThis, again, is a change, which, we have no doubt, would have been made by the Full Court had it been specifically requested on the settlement of the minutes of judgment.\nOn the whole, while not strictly necessary, we think it better, having regard to the doubts which have been suggested as to the prevalent practice in Nova Scotia and as to the effect of a judgment for sale in a foreclosure action, that the order should set forth, as it does in the form settled by the Full Court, subject to the modification suggested, the extent of the estate, etc. which the purchaser acquires at the sale and by the sheriff\u2019s deed.\nIn view of the fact that we are convinced that the plaintiff cannot have any relief in respect of the principal matter urged at bar, and having regard to the more or less formal nature of the alterations we suggest in the terms of the order, while, if the plaintiff so desires, we will grant special leave to appeal confined to the latter matters, we do so only upon the terms that it must, in any event, carry on such appeal entirely at its own cost.\nUnder all the circumstances we do not think there should be any order as to the costs of the present motion. The defendant and those claiming under him were not represented, and the plaintiff has not, in our opinion, made out a case that would justify an order allowing it to add such costs to its claim for the mortgage debt.\nIt will have been observed that in dealing with this motion the merits of the proposed appeal have been discussed. This somewhat unusual course has been taken because such merits were fully argued by counsel representing the applicant for leave and also because of the terms on which, in our opinion, special leave should be granted and of the probability that further proceedings, if taken, will be purely formal.\nMotion refused as to main ground of appeal, but allowed, on terms, as to certain matters indicated; no order as to costs of present motion.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Alfred Whitman.\n[1] [1929] 3 D.L.R. 225.\n[2] [1929] 3 D.L.R. 225.\n[3] (1879) R.E.D., 352\n* See R.S.N.S., 4th Series, (1873), c. 95, s. 20.\n* See 47 Vic.

The King, [1930] S.C.R. 174\nDate: 1929-12-09\nBank of Nova Scotia (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nHis Majesty The King (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1929: November 19; 1929: December 9.\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Newcombe, Rinfret and Smith JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nRevenue\u2014Sales tax\u2014Special War Revenue Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 179, ss. 86 (a), 87 (d)\u2014Bank printing books and stationery for its own use\u2014\u201cManufacturer or producer\u201d\u2014Liability for sales tax.\nThe defendant bank maintained a stationery department through which it supplied its various offices with stationery and supplies required in the conduct of its business, and in said department it had, without any object of gain, but for convenience, expedition, and to secure secrecy, a printing plant with which it printed and made up ledgers, etc., forms, by-laws, letter papers and other printed material, required in carrying on its business.\nHeld, that in respect of said printed material the bank was a \u201cmanufacturer or producer,\u201d and liable for consumption or sales tax, under ss. 86 (a) and 87 (d) of the Special War Revenue Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 179 (and under the corresponding provisions in the earlier legislation contained in s. 19BBB of the Special War Revenue Act, 1915, as amended by 13-14 Geo. V, c. 70, s. 6), and was also liable for licence fee (under said s. 19BBB as amended; now R.S.C., 1927, c. 179, s. 95).\nJudgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, [1929] Ex. C.R., 155, affirmed. APPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada,[1] holding that the defendant was liable for sales tax on certain account books, stationery, etc., printed and made up in its stationery department and furnished to its various offices and branches; and that it was also liable for licence fee. The tax was levied, and the licence fee demanded, under the Special War Revenue Act, 1915 (as amended), now R.S.C., 1927, c. 179.\nThe defendant is an incorporated bank, having its head office at Halifax, Nova Scotia, and its chief executive office at Toronto, Ontario. It maintained in Toronto a stationery department through which it supplied its various offices, including head office, executive office and branch offices, with stationery and supplies required in the conduct of the bank\u2019s business. Without any object of gain but for convenience and expedition and to secure secrecy, it had in its stationery department a printing plant with which it printed and made up ledgers, tellers\u2019 cash books, pass books, legal forms, by-laws, letter paper, ruled and printed forms, return forms of branches to the head office, minute books, stationery, pamphlets and other printed material required in carrying on the bank\u2019s business at its various offices throughout Canada and elsewhere.\nIn the bank\u2019s system of accounting, every office bore its share of all expenses incurred by the bank for such office, including salaries, rental of premises, and cost of stationery and supplies. The stationery and supplies were furnished to the various offices on their requisitions sent to the stationery department and were shipped to such offices direct from the stationery department. On making the shipment, the stationery department rendered statements to the receiving office and to the chief executive office showing the amount to be charged against the receiving office as the cost or estimated cost of the articles furnished.\nThe questions for the court were: (1) whether the defendant was liable to pay a consumption or sales tax on or in respect of the printed material aforesaid; and (2) whether the defendant was liable for a licence fee under s. 19BBB (6) of the Special War Revenue Act, 1915 (as amended) (now R.S.C., 1927, c. 179, s. 95). W. N. Tilley, K.C., for the appellant, contended that from the history of the legislation, and the changes therein, it was indicated that the intention was, as to printers, to apply the tax to those who were in the business of manufacturing or producing printed matter; that the bank was not in any sense a manufacturer or producer within the meaning of the Act; that the tax was meant to apply only to a company or individual who was in the business of manufacturing or producing goods for sale, and did not apply to a bank merely because it made up into a form convenient for its own purposes materials on which the sales tax had already been paid; the printing of headings and column lines on ledgers, deposit slips and the like is a convenient way of doing what might otherwise be done by hand or by a typewriter. The tax was imposed by subs. 1 of s. 19BBB, and not by subs. 13 added in 1923. Subs. 13 merely enabled the value of taxable goods to be determined when a manufacturer used some articles of his own manufacture. The tax was really payable by a manufacturer or producer who was a manufacturer or producer by trade or calling and not by all persons who made up articles for their own convenient use.\nM. H. Ludwig, K.C., for the respondent, relied upon the reasons in the judgment below. He contended that the bank, in carrying on a printing plant and making said printed material, was a producer or manufacturer of goods in Canada within the meaning of the legislation in question; a manufacturer or producer does not necessarily make things for sale; it has become the custom of many industries to maintain manufacturing departments for the production of articles essential to the conduct of the main business which may be quite remote from manufacturing; and such a department is as much a manufacturing establishment as if it were a distinct and separate enterprise (38 Corpus Juris, p. 975); the interpretation sought by the appellant to be placed on the legislation would exempt a corporation financially able to equip itself with a plant to make things, while one without sufficient means to acquire such equipment would have its burden increased at the expense of relieving its more opulent competitor from payment of any tax (in this connection, he referred to Hogg v. Parochial Board of Auchtermuchty[2]); s. 87 (of R.S.C., 1927, c. 179) in effect provides that if a manufacturer uses goods made by him such use shall be deemed a sale and a tax to be fixed by the minister is to be paid in respect of such goods.\nW. N. Tilley, K.C., for the appellant,\nM. H. Ludwig, K.C., for the respondent,\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nAnglin, C.J.C.\u2014The bank appeals from the judgment of the Exchequer Court, delivered on the 17th of May last, and reported in [1929] Ex. C. R. at p. 155. The material facts are there fully stated in the terms of the special case submitted for the consideration of the court.\nWhile the special case purports to submit two questions, viz.,\n(1) Whether on the facts as stated and admitted herein the Defendant is liable to pay His Majesty the King a consumption or sales tax on or in respect of the stationery referred to in paragraph 3 hereof for the period aforesaid.\n(2) Whether the Defendant is liable for the licence fee mentioned in paragraph 5 hereof.\nin reality, there is only one question to be determined, viz., whether or not the appellant bank is a manufacturer or producer of the stationery supplies, furnished by it to its head office and branches, within the meaning of that term as used in the Special War Revenue Act, because it is admitted that if the appellant bank is such a manufacturer or producer it is liable for consumption or sales tax, and paragraph 9 of the special case provides as follows:\n9. If this Honourable Court shall hold that the Defendant is liable to pay His Majesty the King a consumption or sales tax as aforesaid, it is admitted that the Plaintiff shall have:\n(1) Judgment for consumption or sales tax in the sum of $10,205.72, in respect of the said stationery, referred to in paragraph 3 hereof for the period aforesaid.\n(2) Judgment for $10, licence fee mentioned in paragraph 4 hereof.\n(3) Judgment for interest at the rate of five per centum (5%) per annum from the dates when the taxes became due and owing to the first day of June, 1927, and thereafter, at the rate of two-thirds of one per centum (1%) per month, as provided by Section 106, subsection 3 of the Special War Revenue Act.\nThe Exchequer Court would appear to have dealt with the case as governed by ss. 86 (a) and 87 (d) of the R.S.C. 1927, c. 179. But that statute came into force only on the 1st of February, 1928, and the claim is for taxes on \u201csales\u201d between the 1st of January, 1924, and the 30th of April, 1928. It is, therefore, obvious that, except for transactions during the months of February, March and April, 1928, the liability must be determined by reference to the earlier law. That law is to be found in s. 6 of c. 70 of the Statutes of 13-14 Geo. V (1923), amending the Special War Revenue Act of 1915.\nUnder s. 19BBB (1), as there enacted, a consumption or sales tax of 6 per cent. is imposed on \u201cthe sale price of all goods produced or manufactured in Canada * * * payable by the producer or manufacturer at the time of the sale thereof by him.\u201d\n\u201cSale price\u201d is defined to mean \u201cthe price before any amount payable in respect of the consumption or sales tax is added thereto.\u201d\nSubs. 6 of s. 19BBB (as enacted by 13-14 Geo. V, c. 70, s. 6) provides for the taking out of an annual licence by manufacturers or producers. Subs. 13 reads:\n(13) Whenever goods are manufactured or produced in Canada under such circumstances or conditions as render it difficult to determine the value thereof for the consumption or sales tax because, * * *\n(d) such goods are for use by the manufacturer or producer and not for sale\nthe Minister may determine the value for the tax under this Act and all such transactions shall for the purposes of this Act be regarded as sales.\nUnder the legislation, as it then stood, it was determined in Minister of Customs and Excise v. Dominion Press Limited[3], that a job printer is a \u201cproducer\u201d within the meaning of the statute.\nBy amendment of 1926-27, 17 Geo. V., c. 36, s. 4, it was enacted that, for the purposes of s. 19BBB,\nprinters, publishers, lithographers and engravers shall be regarded as producers or manufacturers.\nThis section has been carried into the R.S.C. (1927) as clause (\u0192) of s. 85.\nThe effect of these several provisions is that a construction of the clauses of ss. 85, 86 and 87 of the Special War Revenue Act, c. 179, R.S.C. 1927, suffices to determine the question at issue, because if the appellant bank is \u201ca manufacturer or producer in Canada,\u201d within the meaning of those earlier provisions, it must also be regarded as such a manufacturer or producer within the legislation of 1927. Having regard to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that the bank is liable as claimed and that the appeal therefore fails.\nWe agree with the learned President of the Exchequer Court that as a printer, lithographer or engraver, which produced, for its own use and not for sale, the goods in question, viz., stationery supplies for its head office and branches, the bank was a producer within the meaning of that term, as used in clause (a) of s. 86 of the Special War Revenue Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 179, and that the goods in question were produced in Canada by it within the meaning of that clause.\nWe cannot find anything in the statute to support the view put forward by counsel for the appellant that its application is confined to a manufacturer or producer whose business is manufacturing or producing for sale. That construction of the Act would involve the exclusion from our consideration of clause (d) of s. 87, which, in our opinion, was introduced to remove any doubt that the statute was intended to apply to a case such as that at bar.\nFor these reasons we dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the Appellant: Tilley, Johnston, Thomson & Parmenter.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W. Stuart Edwards.\n[1] [1929] Ex. C.R. 155.\n[2] (1880) 7 Rettie, 986, at p. 996.\n[3] [1927] S.C.R. 583, at p. 587; [1928] A.C. 340.\n",

Plaintiff, under s. 85 of the Insurance Act, R.S.O., 1927, c. 222, sued defendant, which had insured S. against liability for injury to another, for the amount of her judgment.\nHeld: The right of action given by s. 85 is simply a right to sue on the policy in the place and stead of the insured; the plaintiff must establish liability on the policy against the insurer in the same manner and to the same extent as if the action had been brought by the insured; and the facts, required to be established as part of the plaintiff\u2019s case, that the bodily injury to another, insured against, had been inflicted by the insured\u2019s automobile, and that the insured was legally liable in damages to the plaintiff for the injury, are not established as against the insurer by the production of the judgment obtained by plaintiff against the insured. But in the present case the defendant, by reason of an admission at the trial was precluded from contending that the liability of S. to plaintiff had not been established by production of the judgment against S.\nThe injury was inflicted while the automobile was being driven by S.\u2019s son, who was only 16 years of age, and had no permit or licence to drive. The policy contained the statutory condition that the insurer should not be liable \u201cwhile the automobile, with the knowledge, consent or connivance of the insured is being driven by a person under the age limit fixed by law.\u201d\nHeld, without deciding what was \u201cthe age limit fixed by law\u201d (see the Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O., 1927, c. 251, s. 43) within the meaning of said condition, and assuming it to be 18 years, the defendant, to escape liability under the condition, must shew that the boy was driving with the knowledge, consent or connivance of S., and this it had failed to do. Such consent could not be presumed as against the plaintiff by reason of the judgment obtained by plaintiff against S.; it did not necessarily follow that because judgment was given against S., the latter had any knowledge that her son was driving her automobile, or that she consented thereto (among other things in this connection, ss. 41 (1) and 42 (1) of the Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O., 1927, c. 251, were considered).\nJudgment of the Appellate Division, Ont. (64 Ont. L.R. 109) affirming, in the result, the judgment of Raney J., for recovery by the plaintiff against the defendant of the amount claimed, affirmed. This amount included the plaintiff\u2019s costs of an appeal taken by S. from the judgment at trial in the action against S.\nAPPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1] which dismissed its appeal from the judgment of Raney J.[2]\nThe defendant had issued a policy of insurance on an automobile of one Elizabeth Schwartz, insuring her to the extent of $5,000 against liabilities for bodily injuries or death caused to one person by reason of the operation of the automobile.\nThe plaintiff, in her statement of claim, alleged that she had been run down and injured by said automobile, the property of said Elizabeth Schwartz, which automobile at the time of the accident was being operated by A.C. Schwartz, the son of said Elizabeth Schwartz; that the accident and injuries were caused wholly by the negligence of A.C. Schwartz; that the plaintiff had brought action against Elizabeth Schwartz and A.C. Schwartz and had recovered judgment against them for damages in the sum of $2,067.25 and costs; that Elizabeth Schwartz and A.C. Schwartz had appealed to the Appellate Division and the appeal had been dismissed with costs; that the plaintiff\u2019s costs at trial and on the appeal in said action had been taxed at $633.40; that execution for the amount of the judgment and costs was placed with the sheriff who made a return of nulla bona; that plaintiff then notified the present defendant of the accident, the amount of the judgment, the taxed costs and the return of nulla bona, and made formal claim to the defendant, who disputed it.\nThe plaintiff\u2019s claim against the present defendant was by virtue of the provisions of s. 85 of the Ontario Insurance Act, R.S.O., 1927, c. 222. She claimed $2,700.65 (being the sum of said $2,067.25 and said $633.40 costs) and interest thereon from the date of her said demand upon defendant.\nRaney J. gave judgment for the plaintiff as claimed, with costs, and the defendant\u2019s appeal to the Appellate Division was dismissed with costs. The defendant then appealed to this Court. The questions in issue are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was dismissed with costs.\nR.S. Robertson K.C. for the appellant.\nGideon Grant K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nLAMONT J.\u2014On May 28, 1926, the appellant company issued a policy of insurance, in favour of one Elizabeth Schwartz, by which it agreed to indemnify her to the extent of $5,000 against liability for bodily injury or death caused to any one person injured by her automobile described in the policy.\nOn November 17, 1926, Mrs. Schwartz\u2019 automobile, while being driven by her son Alfred Schwartz, a boy of sixteen years of age, ran down and severely injured one Jeanne Yorke. To recover damages for the injuries she sustained Jeanne Yorke brought an action in the Supreme Court of Ontario against Mrs. Schwartz and her son and recovered judgment therein for $2,067.25 and the costs of the action. An appeal taken by Mrs. Schwartz was dismissed. Jeanne Yorke then issued execution on her judgment, to which the sheriff made a return of nulla bona. Not being able to obtain satisfaction for her judgment out of the property of Mrs. Schwartz or her son, Jeanne Yorke brought this action against the appellant company, claiming that it was liable to her in the amount of her judgment and costs, by virtue of a section in the Insurance Act (now s. 85 (1) R.S.O., 1927, c. 222), which section reads as follows:\u2014\n85. (1) In any case in which a person insured against liability for injury or damage to persons or property of others has failed to satisfy a judgment obtained by a claimant for such injury or damage and an execution against the insured in respect thereof is returned unsatisfied, such execution creditor shall have a right of action against the insurer to recover an amount not exceeding the face amount of the policy or the amount of the judgment in the same manner and subject to the same equities as the insured would have if the said judgment had been satisfied.\nIn answer to the claim the appellant set up the following defences:\u2014\n2. The defendant further says that at the time of the accident in question the automobile covered by the contract of insurance was being driven and operated by one A.C. Schwartz, a person under the age of eighteen years, with the knowledge, consent and connivance of the Assured, the said Elizabeth Schwartz.\n3. The defendant further says that the said A.C. Schwartz had not passed an examination and obtained a licence to operate a motor vehicle, as provided by the Highway Traffic Act, 13-14 Geo. V, Chapter 48, Section 44, and was, therefore, prohibited from so driving or operating a motor vehicle on a highway in the Province of Ontario. The defendant says that there is no liability upon it to indemnify the said Elizabeth Schwartz in respect to the accident in question and the plaintiff has no claim against it.\n4. The defendant pleads the Statutory Conditions embodied in the said Contract of Insurance and the provisions of the Ontario Insurance Act, R.S.O. (1927), Chapter 22, as a defence to this action.\nSection 44 of the Highway Traffic Act (now s. 43 of the R.S.O., 1927, c. 251) reads as follows:\u2014\n44. (1) No person under the age of sixteen years shall drive or operate a motor vehicle, and no person over the age of sixteen years and under the age of eighteen years shall drive or operate a motor vehicle on the highway unless and until such person has passed an examination and obtained a licence as provided by section 16 of this Act.\n(2) No person shall employ or permit anyone under the age of sixteen years to drive or operate a motor vehicle and no person shall employ or permit anyone over the age of sixteen and under the age of eighteen years to drive or operate a motor vehicle unless and until he has passed an examination and obtained a licence as provided by section 16.\nSection 16 makes provision for the granting of chauffeurs\u2019 licences, and subsec. (1) is as follows:\u2014\n16. (1) No person shall operate or drive a motor vehicle on a highway as a chauffeur unless he is licensed so to do, and no person shall employ anyone to drive a motor vehicle who is not a licensed chauffeur.\nIncorporated in the insurance policy were certain statutory conditions, of which no. 5 reads as follows:\u2014\n5. The insurer shall not be liable under this policy while the automobile, with the knowledge, consent or connivance of the insured is being driven by a person under the age limit fixed by law, or, in any event, under the age of sixteen years, or by an intoxicated person.\nThe learned trial judge held that the respondent was entitled to recover against the appellant the amount of her judgment and costs, on the ground that the only \u201cage limit fixed by law\u201d in Ontario was sixteen years, and, as Alfred Schwartz was over that age at the time of the accident, statutory condition no. 5 afforded the appellant no relief from liability. On appeal the First Appellate Division[3] affirmed the judgment, the Chief Justice of Ontario and Mr. Justice Middleton for the reasons given by the trial judge, while Mr. Justice Hodgins and Mr. Justice Magee, although of opinion that eighteen years was the age limit fixed by law where a driver had no licence, held that, to escape liability by reason of statutory condition no. 5, the appellant must establish that the boy was driving the automobile with the knowledge, consent or connivance of Mrs. Schwartz, and this had not been established. From the judgment of the Appellate Division this appeal is brought.\nThe respondent\u2019s right of action against the appellant depends upon s. 85 above quoted. That section gives the person injured by an automobile in respect of which the owner has been insured against liability for injury, a \u201cright of action\u201d against the insurance company issuing the policy, provided such injured person has obtained a judgment against the person insured in respect of such injury and has issued execution thereon, and the execution has been returned unsatisfied. At the trial the respondent established that these statutory conditions precedent to her right of action against the appellant had been fulfilled. She then filed the formal judgment she had recovered against Mrs. Schwartz; the certificate of the Appellate Division that the appeal therefrom had been dismissed; the certificate of the taxing office as to the amount of the taxed costs, and the policy of insurance issued by the appellant to Mrs. Schwartz. She then closed her case. The appellant called no witnesses, but it filed a certificate under the hand of the Registrar General that Alfred Schwartz was born September 3rd, 1910, and Mr. Grant, on behalf of respondent, admitted that at the time of the accident Alfred Schwartz had no permit or licence to drive.\nThe first question that arises, therefore, is: On the material put before the court by the respondent, had she established a prima facie case? Section 85 gives the respondent a right of action against the appellant in the same manner and subject to the same equities as the insured would have if she herself had satisfied the judgment. What is the \u201cright of action\u201d here given? In my opinion it is simply a right to sue. The statute gives the respondent a right to sue the appellant on its policy in the place and stead of the insured, which right she would not have had but for the statute. The right to sue may be exercised by the respondent in the same manner as if the insured had paid the judgment and brought the action. This, I take it, refers to procedure. It is also to be exercised subject to equities which would prevail between the appellant and the insured. This, in my opinion, means that the respondent must establish liability on the policy against the appellant to the same extent as if the action had been brought by the insured, and that whatever defences the appellant would have been entitled to raise against the insured it may raise against the respondent. Had Mrs. Schwartz paid the judgment and brought action against the appellant, she must, in my opinion, in order to succeed, have established (1) the agreement to indemnify; (2) that the bodily injury to another insured against had been inflicted by her automobile, and (3) that she was legally liable in damages to the respondent for the injuries received by her.\nIn the present action the respondent established the agreement to indemnify by the production of the policy. The fact that an injury of the kind insured against had resulted from the operation of Mrs. Schwartz\u2019 automobile, and Mrs. Schwartz\u2019 liability therefor, the respondent attempted to establish by the production of her judgment. In my opinion neither the injury nor the liability can, as against the appellant, be established in this manner. In 13 Halsbury, at pp. 542-543, the learned author says:\u2014\nA judgment in personam is conclusive proof as against parties and privies of the truth of the facts upon which such judgment is based, but, excepting as above stated to prove its existence, date, and consequences, it is inadmissible in evidence as against strangers, except (1) where it determines a question of public right and is admissible as evidence of reputation; (2) in bankruptcy or administration proceedings; (3) in divorce cases; and (4) to some extent in patent actions.\nIn Allan v. McTavish[4], Burton J.A. points out that a judgment is conclusive upon third parties as well as upon the defendant to establish the relationship of debtor and creditor, and the amount of the debt and the date of its recovery; but that it furnishes no evidence whatever as regards third persons of the allegations in it on which re- covery proceeded. \u201cThose facts,\u201d his Lordship says \u201cif material to the plaintiff\u2019s case, have to be established by appropriate evidence.\u201d See also Ballantyne v. Mackinnon[5]; Castrique v. Imrie[6]; Duchess of Kingston\u2019s case[7].\nIf the judgment was evidence as against the appellant of the existence of the injury insured against and of the liability of the insured therefor, the appellant would be liable on the policy if the insured, having a good defence to the claim for damages, failed to set it up in her pleadings, and prove it at the trial, and judgment went against her on that account. This would be to expose the appellant to the obligation of indemnifying the insured not only where it had agreed to do so, but also where it had not agreed to do so but judgment had been obtained against the insured through failure on her part to set up or establish an available defence.\nThe respondent\u2019s judgment not being evidence as against the appellant of the circumstances upon which it was founded, there was no evidence before the court that the conditions, upon which liability under the policy arose, had been fulfilled. Had the matter rested there the plaintiff would have been in the position of not having proved her case. The matter, however, did not rest there. At the trial counsel for both parties were of opinion that the appellant was precluded by the judgment from raising the question of Mrs. Schwartz\u2019 liability to the respondent. After Mr. Grant, who appeared for the respondent, had read to his Lordship s. 85 of the Insurance Act, the following discussion took place:\u2014\nHIS LORDSHIP: Does that mean that the plaintiff will have to make her case over again?\nMr. GRANT: Oh, no, she sues on the judgment.\nHIS LORDSHIP: The insurance company have (had) an opportunity to come in, and they are practically precluded by the judgment.\nMr. GRANT: Yes, my Lord.\nMr. WALSH: Yes, nothing turns on that; I am ready to admit all that.\nIn view of this admission it is not now open to the appellant to contend that the liability of Mrs. Swartz to the re- spondent for injuries received has not been established by the judgment.\nBefore the learned trial judge counsel for the appellant contended that the only point in controversy was the construction to be put on statutory condition no. 5. This appears from the following statement by Mr. Walsh:\nMr. WALSH: I suppose my learned friend wants to get down to what is the real contest in this trial. The real contest is that we say that under the provisions of this policy, Statutory Condition No. 5, we are relieved from liability, because the boy who was driving the car was not of an age permitted by law to drive the car.\nAlthough counsel for the respondent agreed that the construction of statutory condition no. 5 was the chief point in controversy, he argued that the consent of Mrs. Swartz to her son driving her automobile could not be presumed from the judgment. The following shews the view taken by counsel:\nHIS LORDSHIP: What is the real controversy now?\nMr. GRANT: The construction of Section 5, my Lord.\nMr. WALSH: That was my understanding, that it really got down to section 5.\nHIS LORDSHIP: On what point?\nMr. GRANT: As to whether this boy is one of the prohibited class.\nHIS LORDSHIP: On the assumption that he was not driving with the consent of the mother.\nMr. WALSH: * * * he could be driving with the consent of the mother, because my learned friend has taken judgment against the mother. * * *\nThe argument on behalf of the appellant was (a) that, under s. 44 of the Highway Traffic Act, the age limit fixed by law, for one who had not passed an examination and obtained a licence, was eighteen years, and that it was admitted that Alfred Schwartz at the time of the accident was only sixteen years of age and had no licence to drive an automobile, and (b) that the respondent was estopped from saying that the boy was not driving with the consent of his mother because the respondent had taken a judgment against the mother which she was only entitled, under the statute, to have if the boy was driving with his mother\u2019s consent.\nIn the view which I take of the second branch of this argument, it is not necessary in this appeal to determine \u201cthe age limit fixed by law,\u201d within the meaning of condition no. 5 (which question I leave open), for, assuming that the appellant\u2019s contention is right and that the age limit fixed by law is eighteen years, the appellant, to escape liability under the condition, must also shew that the boy was driving with the knowledge, consent or connivance of his mother. Of this there was absolutely no evidence.\nThe appellant\u2019s contention that, as against the respondent, such consent must be presumed, cannot, in my opinion, be supported. Sec. 42 (1)[8] provides that the owner of a motor vehicle shall be responsible for any violation of the Act unless, at the time of such violation, the motor vehicle was in the possession of some person other than the owner or his chauffeur without the owner\u2019s consent.\nSec. 43[9] reads as follows:\n43. (1) When loss or damage is sustained by any person by reason of a motor vehicle on a highway, the onus of proof that such loss or damage did not arise through the negligence or improper conduct of the owner or driver of the motor vehicle shall be upon the owner or driver.\nIf, therefore, Mrs. Schwartz, in the case of Yorke v. Schwartz, did not set up in her pleadings, and prove at the trial, that her son was, at the time of the accident, driving her automobile without her consent, judgment may have gone against her because she did not meet the onus cast upon her by s. 43, although, as a matter of fact, the son may have been driving the car not only without her consent but contrary to her instructions. Furthermore, I do not see anything in the Act that would prevent Mrs. Schwartz from being liable at common law for the damage caused by her son\u2019s negligence if it were shewn that he was in her employ and, at the time of the accident, in the course of his employment. It does not necessarily follow, therefore, that because judgment was given against her, Mrs. Schwartz had any knowledge that her son was driving her automobile, or that she consented thereto.\nIn the present action it was repeatedly stated by Mr. Grant at the trial, that, in the suit of Yorke v. Schwartz, the consent of Mrs. Schwartz was not a matter in issue, nor was any finding made thereon. The pleadings in that case were not put in evidence and they are not before us. The position taken by the parties appears clearly from the discussion before the trial judge. After Mr. Walsh had stated that the respondent was estopped from questioning the consent of Mrs. Schwartz to her son driving the car, the following discussion took place:\u2014\nMr. GRANT: That was not the issue at all in the other action.\nMr. WALSH: I think it was.\nMr. GRANT: Well, look at the pleadings and you will see what was at issue.\nMr. WALSH: I was not at the trial of the other action.\nMr. GRANT: Well, I have the pleadings here, and you can see them if you want to.\nHIS LORDSHIP: Well, do you want to offer any evidence?\nMr. WALSH: I would if there was any contest about that, my Lord.\nHIS LORDSHIP: Mr. Grant is not admitting that the automobile was driven with the knowledge and consent of the insured. You are not admitting that?\nMr. GRANT: No, I am not admitting that; * * *\nMr. Walsh then informed the court that he had subpoenaed the boy\u2019s mother but that she had not yet arrived in court. The hearing was adjourned until she arrived. On her arrival the following took place:\u2014\nMr. WALSH: My Lord, since the adjournment I have looked into this matter a little further; I do not think that I am called upon to call this witness.\nHIS LORDSHIP: Well, don\u2019t argue it now, but make your own case in your own way, and then we will get to the argument.\nMr. WALSH: Well, I am going to say, my Lord, I am going to rely on Section 41 of the Act.\nHIS LORDSHIP: Then you are closing your case?\nMr. WALSH: Yes, my Lord.\nThe appellant was clearly aware that the respondent was not admitting that the boy was driving the car with the consent of his mother. The onus was, therefore, upon the appellant to prove it. That it did not do. The defence, therefore, fails.\nAs to the amount which the respondent is entitled to recover against the appellant, I agree with the court below. The only item requiring consideration is the costs of the appeal by Mrs. Schwartz in the former action. That appeal, I think, was a reasonable one and would likely have been taken by the appellant had it defended the action.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Walsh & Mungovan.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Johnson, Grant, Dods & MacDonald.\n[1] (1929) 64 Ont.

Ward (Defendant) Respondent\n1929: October 7; 1929: December 9.\nPresent:\u2014Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Rinfret, Lamont and Smith JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA\nContract\u2014Construction\u2014Nature of transaction\u2014Whether loan secured on land or agreement of sale of land with option of re-purchase\u2014Admission of parol evidence\u2014Findings on the evidence\u2014Transaction in substance a loan on security\u2014Stipulation for right of purchase in lender, void as repugnant to equitable right of redemption. It was held, reversing judgment of the Appellate Division, Alta., 24 Alta. L.R. 48, and restoring judgment of Boyle J. at trial, that the agreement embodied in the document in question, between P. (appellant's assignor) and respondent, was, not for the sale of land from P. to respondent with an option of repurchase, but for a loan from respondent to P. on security of the land. The document, taken by itself, in certain respects favoured the latter construction. But, further, the parties' rights were not to be determined exclusively by examining the terms in the document; evidence was admissible, not only of the surrounding circumstances, but also of all the oral or written communications between the parties relating to the transaction, for the purpose of determining its true nature (Lincoln v. Wright, 4 De G. & J. 16, at p. 22; Maung Kyin v. Ma Shwe La, 45 Indian L.R. [Calcutta series], 320, at p. 332, and other cases cited). Even where the instrument professes fully and clearly to give the reasons and considerations on which it proceeds, collateral evidence is admissible to shew that the transaction is not thereby truly stated, although, in such cases, only the most cogent evidence avails to rebut the presumption to the contrary (Barton v. Bank of N.S.W., 15 App. Cas. 379, at p. 381). In the present case, in view of the summary character of the document and the superficial incoherence of its terms, resort to parol evidence was peculiarly appropriate; and upon all the evidence (as viewed by this Court, and with the findings thereon by the trial judge) the substance of the transaction must be held to have been a loan on security. In such case the court will disregard, as repugnant to the equitable right of redemption, a stipulation professing to confer upon the lender the right of purchase, even if the parties, between themselves, had intended that it should be binding (G. & C. Kleglinger v. New Patagonia Meat & Cold Storage Co. Ltd., [1914] A.C. 25, at p. 52, and other cases, cited).\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta [1] which held, reversing the judgment of Boyle J. at trial, that the agreement set out in the document in question (quoted in full in the judgment now reported), made between one Pellon (who later transferred to plaintiff his interest in the land in question and in said agreement) and the defendant, was an agreement of sale of land from Pellon to the defendant, and not, as contended by the plaintiff, in effect a mortgage to secure a loan from the defendant to Pellon.\nBy the judgment now reported the appeal was allowed, with costs in this Court and in the Appellate Division, and the judgment of the trial judge was restored.\nW. N. Tilley K.C. for the appellant.\nE. Lafleur K.C. and A. A. Ballachey K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDUFF J.\u2014In May, 1927, A. L. Pellon was the registered owner of section 23 and of the south half and the north-east quarter of section 25, Township 20, Range 24, Alberta (1120 acres), subject to a lease in favour of the respondent for two years from the 1st of February, 1927, and to a charge securing a balance of purchase money owing to the Crown, and to certain executions. The beneficial owner of the lands in section 25 was the appellant, and for some years Pellon had farmed both parcels, for the appellant and himself as partners. Pellon had become involved in financial difficulties, judgments had been recovered against him, and executions thereunder had been filed against the appellant's land as well as his own.\nIn these circumstances Pellon applied for a loan on the 13th of May, 1927, to the respondent, who paid to Pellon, on the same day, $1,500 by cheque. The issue in the appeal is: What was the character of the transaction, between these parties, of that date?\nThe appellant, to whom, in April, 1928, Pellon transferred section 23, says that Pellon borrowed from the respondent $1,500, and that this sum, together with $300 borrowed in March of the same year, was made a charge upon section 23, the whole principal of $1,800, with interest from the dates of the respective loans, being repayable in ninety days. The respondent denies the loan and avers that the agreement between him and Pellon was an agreement for the sale of section 23 on terms set forth in a document of that date.\nThe trial judge found that the agreement was in fact of the character contended for by the appellant, and his judgment was reversed by the Appellate Division[2], who held that the transaction was a sale.\nThe document is in these words:\nThis Agreement is made in duplicate this 13th day of May, 1927, Between\nArthur L. Pellon, party of the first part,\nand\nMilton H. Ward, party of the second part.\nWhereas the party of the first part is the owner of Section 23, Township 20, Range 24, West of the Fourth, and is desirous of obtaining a loan on the same for the sum of $1,800, and whereas the party of the second part is willing to advance the said amount on the following conditions:\nNamely that in consideration of the said loan the party of the first part hereby agrees to sell the said lands to the party of the second part at or for the sum of $24,320. The sum of $1,800 being paid on the execution of this Agreement, receipt is hereby acknowledged, and the balance to be paid at the rate of $5,000 per year on December 1 of each year until paid, beginning with December 1, 1927.\nProviding, nevertheless, that an option is hereby granted to the party of the first part to purchase back the said lands from the party of the second part herein within 90 days from the date hereof, at or for the sum of $1,840, said option to be exercised by him within 90 days from the date hereof.\nIn witness hereof both of the parties hereto have set their hands and seals this 13th day of May, 1927.\nArthur L. Pellon (Seal)\nM. H. Ward (Seal)\nThe document is unusual in form, and upon the construction of it as it stands, there is room for divergent views. On the part of the respondent, it is contended that it embodies an agreement for sale and purchase of the lands mentioned for the sum of $24,320, of which $1,800 is acknowledged as paid on the execution of the agreement, and of which the residue is to be paid according to the terms stated; with a stipulation in favour of the vendor awarding him an option of re-purchase at the price of $1,840, to be exercised within ninety days of the date of the document, that is to say, on or before the 11th of August ensuing. This view of the document was accepted by the Court of Appeal. It is a view, however, open to criticism. In the first paragraph, the parties declare that the appellant is desirous of obtaining a loan of $1,800, secured on the property in question, and that on the \"following conditions\" the respondent is willing to \"advance the said amount.\" The \"conditions\" are then set forth. It is important, in considering the document, that while the subsequent paragraph contains the terms of an undertaking to sell on the part of Pellon, this undertaking is expressed to be in \"consideration of the said loan\"\u2014that is to say, if the words are not to be emptied of all meaning, in consideration of a loan, by the respondent to Pellon, secured upon Pellon's property.\nThe view for which the respondent contends necessitates the rejection of this recital with which the document opens and which professes to declare its central purpose. By that I mean, that the application for the loan is affirmed, that the assent of the lender to grant the loan is affirmed; true, the assent is upon conditions, but when the conditions are stated, they are stated as conditions agreed to in consideration of the loan, which has been arranged between the parties. The basis of the transaction is a loan. All this, if we are to accept the respondent's construction, must be deleted as meaningless. A \"loan\" which does not involve an obligation of repayment is a contradiction in terms.\nThe appellant's construction is by no means free from difficulty, but in truth it involves no such radical operation as that required by the respondent's. Strictly, to establish the appellant's contention, it is necessary to ascribe to the recital its full effect and to read the proviso giving an option to Pellon to repurchase the land as a proviso for redemption on repayment of the loan with interest. That, of course, would be a departure from the literal meaning of the words, but in that manner of reading them one would be doing only what, in countless cases, the courts have done in similar circumstances.\nReading the document thus, it would present no difficulty from the legal point of view. The agreement for sale, on this hypothesis, is part of the security transaction, that is to say, it is one of the terms of the loan, and is a term which, on failure by the borrower to exercise the contractu al right of redemption, imposes a fetter upon the equitable right, or rather limits and circumscribes the equitable right in such a way as to entitle the lender to require the borrower to transfer the subject of the security to him on the payment of certain specified sums of money. To this subject it will be necessary to recur. For the present it is sufficient to say that such a term, where the transaction is primarily and substantively a loan on the security of the debtor's property, will be disregarded by the courts.\nIt is unnecessary to say more on the construction of this irregular document. In its terms it is not indubitably a contract of sale or a contract for security, and the rights of the parties are not to be determined exclusively by an examination of those terms. The learned trial judge rightly held that evidence was admissible, not only of the surrounding circumstances, but as well, of all the oral or written communications between the parties, relating to the transaction, for the purpose of determining whether they were truly effecting a sale of Pellon's property to Ward or a loan on the security of Pellon's land. The pertinent rule is founded upon principle, and the principle is thus stated by a great equity judge, Turner L.J., in Lincoln v. Wright[3]:\nThe principle of the Court is that the Statute of Frauds was not made to cover fraud. If the real agreement in this case was that as between plaintiff and Wright the transaction should be a mortgage transaction, it is, in the eye of this Court, fraud to insist on the conveyance as being absolute, and parol evidence must be admissible to prove the fraud.\nThis passage was approved and adopted by the Judicial Committee (the Board including Lord Dunedin, Lord Shaw and Lord Sumner) in Maung Kyin v. Ma Shwe La[4]; and the rule is enunciated or exemplified in a great number of reported cases. England v. Codrington[5]; Vernon v. Bethell[6]; Reeks v. Postlethwaite[7]; Hodle v. Healey[8]; Barton v. Bank of New South Wales [9] ; G. & C. Kreglinger v. New Patagonia Meat and Cold Storage Co. Ltd.[10]. Even where the instrument in question professes fully and clearly to give the reasons and considerations on which it proceeds, collateral evidence is admissible to show that the transaction is not thereby truly stated, although in such cases, only the most cogent evidence avails to rebut the presumption to the contrary, Barton v. Bank of N.S.W.[11]. In the case before us, in view of the summary character of the document and the superficial incoherence of its terms, resort to parol evidence is peculiarly appropriate.\nPellon gave a plain statement of his dealings with the respondent. He said that in March, 1927, he had borrowed $300 from the respondent, and that on the 13th of May, the date of the document, he requested a further loan on the security of lot 23. He suggested a mortgage; the respondent was doubtful about the suggestion, in view of the fact that there were judgments and executions against Pellon, and finally after interviewing his banker, he informed Pellon that the banker had made a suggestion which was this: that Pellon should give to the respondent an option on his property, which the respondent could use as security for a loan from the bank, which was necessary to enable the respondent to make the advance. To this Pellon assented, and they went together to a solicitor, who drew up up the document in question, which they executed. Some discussion arose as to the price to be named in the agreement, and Pellon, according to his story, said that, in the circumstances, the price was wholly immaterial, and the arbitrary figure of $38 an acre was inserted, on that footing. At first, Pellon desired credit for only fifteen days, and eventually ninety days was agreed to. In sum, Pellon's account is, that both the respondent and himself understood the transaction to be, as described in the recital, a loan upon security, and that the agreement was given the form in which we find it solely to conform to the requirements of the banker.\nPellon fully expected to repay the loan on the stipulated date, but finding that the source, from which he hoped to provide himself with the means of doing so, had failed him, he informed the respondent of this by telegram on the 20th of July, and requested him to make arrangements to bor- row, on the security of Pellon's share of the crop, for the purpose of liquidating the debt. Receiving no answer to the telegram, he went to Arrowwood, travelling from Montana, only to find that the respondent was absent in Eastern Canada. Later, on his return home, he found a letter purporting to be signed by the respondent, in these terms:\nArrowwood, Alberta,\nAugust 11, 1927.\nMr. Arthur L. Pellon,\nLinton, Oregon, U.S.A.\nDear Sir:\nRegister and Return\nRe All of Section Twenty-three (23) in Township Twenty (20), Range Twenty-four (24). West of the 4th Meridian, Province of Alberta.\nIn connection with our Agreement of Sale dated the 13th day of May, 1927, as you have not exercised your option to repurchase this land from me within the 90 days as set out therein, I am now presuming that the land is mine and that you have decided to carry out the Agreement according to the tenor thereof as I have not heard from you to date.\nYours very truly,\nM. H. Ward.\nCopy sent to the addressee at Linton, Oregon, U.S.A. and at Greybull, Wyoming, U.SA., and at Northern Hotel, Billings, Montana, U.S.A.\nOn receiving this letter, Pellon wrote to the respondent as follows:\nGreybull, Wyo. 8\/21\/27.\nM. H. Ward, Esq.,\nArrowwood, Alta.\nDear Sir,\u2014\nUpon my return to Greybull after an absence since July 12, I find your letter of August 11, and am surprised at its contents.\nI wired you from Twin Falls, Idaho, about July 20, about this loan and never received a reply and then I went to the expense of coming up to Canada to see you and arrange with you to get a loan on my share of the crop and reimburse yourself to the extent of $1,840, but you were absent in Eastern Canada so my trip was for nothing.\nTo make a long story short, I was called back here on a very important business matter and could not wait longer in Calgary\u2014having been there over a week waiting for your return.\nYou are hereby authorized to secure the amount of loan $1,840 and use as security, my share of crop. This will take care of you if you can not carry the loan until you can sell sufficient wheat to do so.\nCertainly you remember you said this agreement was only for the purpose of getting the money from banker, and for that purpose alone.\nThat land would cost you at least twice the price mentioned in agreement and after I personally explain the situation believe you will carry out our plan as originally agreed, and, as I believe, mutually understood. Your letter smacks too much of Lyle-Hempleman procedure to come from one whom I have always considered a square-shooter and a friend. Better follow suggestion as above and let me hear from you again.\nYours very truly,\nA. L. Pellon.\nNo reply to this letter was received or sent, and after a lapse of some days, Pellon again went to Arrowwood, and this time succeeded in interviewing the respondent. The respondent's testimony as to what occurred on that occasion will be noted in some detail; in the meantime it is sufficient to say that Pellon, according to his own account, having interrogated Ward as to the meaning of his letter of the 11th, was met by excuses. Ward said the letter was necessary for his own protection because of the seizure of the crop by Pellon's execution creditors, but that the matter would be cleared up satisfactorily when the crop was threshed. Pellon's words are:\nQ. What conversation did you have with him?\nA. Well, I said to him, \"You surely didn't mean what you said in your letter that I received a few weeks ago, did you?\nQ. Meaning the letter of August 11th?\nA. Yes, and he said, \"I had to do that to protect my own interests and to satisfy the banker. They have been hounding the life out of me every week about that.\"\nQ. Yes.\nA. And he went on to say that he had to do it, too, because these fellows had made a seizure of all the crop and that is about the gist of the conversation, there was not very much of anything said further than that, except as soon as he got threshed it would be all fixed up.\nQ. As soon as you got threshed?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Was there a good crop on the land?\nA. Yes.\nQ. What did half the value of the crop amount to on this land in 1927?\nA. Something a little over $5,000.\nQ. Something over $5,000 from half the crop?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And one-half of that one-half of course had to be paid to the Dominion Government?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And the other half was yours?\nA. Yes.\nWard believed, there can be no doubt, that in the document of the 13th of May, he was armed with an instrument that enabled him to maintain the rights of a purchaser, subject to an option of repurchase vested in Pellon, which at this time had lapsed by reason of the expiry of the time limit. Nor is it, on the evidence, doubtful that the form of the transaction, whether suggested by the banker or not, was not in fact dictated by the necessity of conforming to the wishes of the banker, in order to enable Ward to obtain an advance from the bank, but was proposed by Ward for the purpose of enabling him to assert such rights, and in full confidence that Pellon would not exercise his option within the stipulated period.\nIf Pellon's evidence, therefore, is to be accepted, the conclusion of the learned trial judge appears to be unassailable. Ward permitted the appellant to believe that he was entering into a transaction, the essence of which was a loan upon security, while he himself was confident that the effect of it, in law, was to make him a purchaser, and from the beginning intended to take advantage of the transaction, in that sense, in asserting the rights of a purchaser. Beyond that, indeed, if Pellon's evidence is credible, Ward procured Pellon's assent to the transaction, in the form in which he proposed it, by misrepresenting material facts, as to the necessity, namely, of giving the agreement that particular form in order to enable him to make the advance to Pellon.\nAssuming these facts, the legal result is not open to controversy. It is quite true that, prima facie, a sale, expressed in an instrument containing nothing to show the relation of debtor and creditor is to exist between the parties, does not cease to be a sale, and become a security for money, merely because the instrument contains a stipulation that the vendor shall have a right of repurchase. Alderson v. White[12]; Manchester, Sheffield & Lincolnshire Railway Co. v. North Central Wagon Co.[13]. But where the language of the instrument points to the existence of such a relation, the courts, as Lord Hardwicke said, have endeavoured to treat such instruments as securities. Longuet v. Scawen[14];. In Douglas v. Culverwell[15]; Knight Bruce L.J., after stating that the plaintiff had executed the conveyance there in question with the inten- tion that it should take effect, not as an absolute conveyance, which it was in form, but as a security for money, proceeded thus:\nI am satisfied also that this understanding\u2014this view of the matter\u2014 the plaintiff, before and on the occasion of his execution of the deed and before and when he received the money, was allowed, knowingly allowed, by the defendant to entertain. I am satisfied that the deed, at the time of its execution by the plaintiff, was accepted by the defendant with full knowledge that the plaintiff so understanding the matter so received the \u00a3101.\nIn these circumstances, the Lords Justices held that the instrument was to be treated as creating a security only. Here, according to the evidence of Pellon, not only did Ward fully know the state of Pellon's mind, the express arrangement was that the document was to be used as security.\nSuch being the substance of the transaction, the law, as already observed, would disregard the stipulations professing to confer upon the respondent the right of purchase, even if the parties, between themselves, had intended that these should be binding. Such stipulations are repugnant to the equitable right of redemption; they would have the effect of converting what was intended to be a security into something entirely different. It has long been settled that equity will not allow a mortgagee to enter into a contract with the mortgagor, at the time of the loan, for the absolute purchase of the subject of the mortgage for a specific sum in case of default in payment of the mortgage money at the appointed time. The rule had its origin in the Ecclesiastical Courts. In the Court of Chancery, it was a rule of policy based upon a recognition of the disposition of money lenders to use their power of dictating the form of a security transaction, in order to shape it in such a way as to make it possible to \"wrest the estate out of the hands of the mortgagor.\" Mellor v. Lees[16]; Price v. Perrie [17] ; Willett v. Winnell[18]; Bowen v. Edwards[19]; Re Edwards[20]. And it applies, not only to mortgages, strictly so called, or to mortgages containing a contractual proviso for redemption, but, as well, to mortgages containing no such express proviso, and to agreements creating only an equitable charge. If it is clear that the transaction is a transaction of loan, and that the interest in the property affected is vested in the lender by way of security only, then such stipulations are void as repugnant to the equitable right of redemption. As Lord Parker said in G. & C. Kleglinger v. New Patagonia Meat and Cold Storage Company, Limited[21], in such a case\nthe right to redeem is from the very outset a right in equity only, and it is merely the right to have the property freed from the charge on payment of the moneys charged thereon. If the charge is for payment of a specified sum on a specified day, payment on that day will set the property free, and if the day passes without payment there will still be an equity to have the property so freed notwithstanding any provision in the nature of a penalty, such penal provision being a clog on the equity.\nHere the learned trial judge held that the true nature of the transaction is disclosed by the recitals and the statement of the consideration. Although he has expressed his opinion that such is the effect of the document he had to consider, apart from the oral evidence as to what occurred between the parties, he has not limited himself to that; he has considered the evidence; assessed the relative weight of the testimony of the two principal witnesses, Pellon and the respondent; and stated his conclusions of fact. Among other things, he has held that Pellon's account of the transaction of May the 13th is true and should be accepted, and the cardinal question in the appeal is whether or not in this he is right, or rather, whether or not there are adequate grounds for holding he is wrong.\nThe learned trial judge, it may be said, in applying himself to the questions of fact, realized that he was confronted with a disagreeable duty of deciding for himself and expressing his decision, whether it was Pellon or the respondent who was endeavouring to mislead the court. And there was really no middle course open to him. If the respondent was honestly relating the facts as he recollected them, there could be no room for doubt that Pellon was dishonestly trying to escape from the bargain he had made; and it will also appear as I proceed, that if Pellon was telling the truth, it is impossible to reconcile that conclusion with the honesty of the respondent. I pass now to an examination of the respondent's account of these matters. He opens the story of his dealings with Pellon by a statement that during the negotiations for the lease executed in the autumn of 1926, Pellon said that he hoped the respondent would become the purchaser of sections 23 and 25. He says he lent Pellon at that time $1,000, Pellon promising to repay him when he sold his land, with a bonus of $4,000. Pellon says that the respondent paid him $1,000 at this time, but that this payment was a bonus on the lease, for which he had been offered, as bonus, still larger sums. The respondent admits that Pellon told him he had been offered a bonus of $1,500. The learned trial judge in delivering his judgment observed that he did not believe this story of the respondent, and counsel for the respondent intervened with the remark, \"We withdrew that $1,000, my Lord, in our argument.\" Proceeding with the material incidents, in order of date, the respondent says, that in March, 1927, he paid Pellon $300. He says there were negotiations between him and Pellon for the purchase of Wilson's interest in section 25, and that, although these negotiations had not been concluded, this sum of $300 was paid to Pellon as an advance on account of the purchase money. On his examination for discovery, he persisted in declaring that this $300 formed no part of the sum of $1,800, the payment of which was acknowledged by the document of the 13th of May; that this latter sum was paid in two cheques, one for $1,750, and one for $50 on the last mentioned date. At the trial he abandoned this, admitting that only $1,500 had been advanced in May, that the sum of $1,800 acknowledged in the document comprised this advance together with the advance of $300 made in March.\nHis evidence, both on discovery, and in the early part of his examination at the trial, evinced a determination not to admit that any part of the sum of $1,800 had been advanced as a loan. Being obliged, at the trial, to admit that the $300, advanced in March, was included in it, he once more resorts to the position that the last mentioned advance was not a loan, but a payment on account of a prospective agreement of purchase. This, eventually, he is constrained to withdraw. The same anxiety is disclosed concerning the sum of $40, part of the $1,840 in the repayment or redemp- tion clause. Pellon had explained that this sum was made up by calculating interest on the two loans of $300 and $1,500 (together comprising the $1,800), from their respective dates to the end of the ninety days period of credit, which, at 8% came to $39. The Appellate Division seems to accept this account of the matter. On his examination for discovery, the respondent denied, at the outset, in the most explicit way, that this sum represented interest; later he declared that it was added by Pellon as interest on two sums, one, the $300, already mentioned, and the other, a sum of $200, for which he had given a cheque, some time before March, 1927, both sums being on account of purchase money for lot 25. At the trial, in his examination in chief, he again, in the most definite way, denies that the $40 was added as interest, declaring it was offered by Pellon, as a \"bonus\" for what he, the respondent, \"had done\"; finally he admits it was interest calculated, as he had said on discovery, on these two sums of $300 and $200. On further cross-examination, after an adjournment, he withdraws his statement that he had given a cheque for $200 prior to May, 1927, declared he had made an advance, which might have been of any amount between $100 and $300, and that this advance was a loan. Why the amount of this loan was not included in the sum secured (or credited, as the respondent contends) by the document of May, no reason is suggested. Throughout, Ward persists in denying that any part of it represents interest on the $1,500 advanced in May. But, as an account of the fixing of the redemption price at $1,840, his story is, of course, valueless; and the learned trial judge naturally would have none of it.\nI have mentioned more than once the respondent's statement that prior to the execution of the lease in the autumn of 1926, Pellon had initiated negotiations for the sale to him of both Pellon's and the appellant's property, and his affirmation, many times repeated, that the payment of $300 in March was made as part of the purchase money under a prospective agreement for the purchase of section 25. As a witness, Ward displayed some persistence in picturing Pellon as the eager vendor. This is part of his evidence: A. About the time the lease was drawn Mr. Pellon made the suggestion he would sell the land or eventually he would sell both parcels of land to me.\nQ. And when next was the matter discussed?\nQ. Well it almost continued at that time, off and on until such time as the deal was closed.\nQ. That is until you ultimately purchased?\nA. Purchased.\nQ. Well it continued with which parcel of land?\nA. Well, 25 was under negotiations for an agreement for sale from that time on until it was purchased and Mr. Pellon offered Section 23 for sale in May, 1927.\nIn pursuance of these efforts he asserts that, on the 13th of May, Pellon \"seemed anxious to sell his land.\" Eventually, confronted by his examination for discovery, and by Pellon's proposal, which he admits, of a credit of only fifteen days, he is obliged to concede that Pellon told him he wanted to keep his land. The learned trial judge, very justly as it seems to me, treated this story, in its various elements, as to Pellon's suggestion about the sale of section 23 at the time of the execution of the lease, as to the character of the advance of the $300 in March, and as to Pellon's anxiety to sell in May, as unworthy of credence.\nAnother feature of the respondent's testimony, concerning the occurrences of the 13th of May, deserves notice. The learned trial judge comments upon the manner in which the respondent meets Pellon's evidence giving an account of his excuse for insisting upon the agreement for sale as a necessary part of the document evidencing the loan.\nHe seems determined, as the learned trial judge says, to make it appear that Pellon's narrative is wholly baseless. In answer to questions as to what he had told Pellon about his visit to the bank, he insists and reiterates that he did not \"have to borrow\" from the bank; and, later, that he did not in fact borrow \"for such a purpose.\" He is forced to admit that on that day he did borrow $1,500 from the bank, and that this same amount of money he paid to Pellon in two cheques; but he declares that the loan from the bank had nothing to do with his advance to Pellon. Contrast this with his evidence on discovery:\nQ. Did you have to make any arrangement with your banker in order to loan it to him or give it to him or pay it to him?\nA. Not necessarily. Q. Did you, as a matter of fact, make any arrangements with your banker before you advanced this $1,800 to him?\nA. I borrowed some money that day from the bank.\nQ. For the purpose of making this advance to Pellon?\nA. Yes.\nThis effort to discredit Pellon naturally affected the learned trial judge unfavourably. I will not multiply instances of such exploits of evasion. After carefully reading Ward's evidence, I am driven to the conclusion that the characterization of Ward by the trial judge, in the following passage, does him no injustice.\nBut I must say that in my opinion Ward was a very evasive and hedging kind of witness. It was very difficult indeed to get him to answer frankly the questions which were asked, he was anything but a frank witness. He was frank enough with respect to anything which was in his favour but he appeared to have a very keen sense of the situation and with respect to anything which was not in his favour it was extremely difficult to nail him down and get him to answer the questions directly which were asked him.\nWard's counsel emphasizes a letter written on November 15, 1927. Before examining this, one further passage in the evidence of Ward requires attention. I have already mentioned the interview between Ward and Pellon on the occasion of Pellon's visit to Arrowwood after his failure to get an answer to his letter of the 21st of August. Ward discusses the interview several times during his cross-examination. This is one passage in which he gives his account of it:\nQ. So you say that all you can think of concerning the reason for Pellon's visit in August, 1927, was to see how the crop was getting along?\nA. That is all.\nQ. The crop on 25?\nA. He just asked about his crop.\nQ. His crop?\nA. His crop.\nQ. Did he mention 25?\nA. He didn't mention any particular section.\nQ. No, just his crop?\nA. Just his crop.\nQ. He didn't mention 25 or 23?\nA. No, he didn't.\nQ. Nothing said about that?\nA. No.\nQ. But he must have referred to 25, must he not?\nA. He simply asked 'how his crop was, in that way, that is all.\nQ. Do you know where he came from to see you at the end of August?\nA. No, I don't exactly.\nQ. Do you know he motored 800 miles to see you? A. No, I don't.\nQ. Did he tell you that?\nA. He told me that. I don't know where he came from.\nQ. To see how his one quarter of the crop on Wilson's land was getting along?\nA. He came there and asked me about the crop.\nIn substance this account is repeated more than once. That Ward, having Pellon's letter of the 21st of August before him, could have doubted the object of Pellon's visit, is difficult to believe. That the interview could have been of the character described in this passage seems almost incredible, and the cross-examiner did succeed in dragging out of Ward the admission that Pellon begged him to say that he \"didn't mean\" the letter of the 15th. To this admission he afterwards adds that he told Pellon he must insist on carrying out the agreement. Here, as elsewhere, Ward's evidence is marked very conspicuously by lack of candour. Further discussion of this interview naturally falls into place with the consideration of the letter of November, to which I now come.\nThis is a letter written by Mr. Mavor, acting not for Pellon but for Wilson, and in order to appreciate the point made for the respondent, it is necessary to understand the circumstances in which it was prepared. The three quarter-sections of section 25, although owned by Wilson, were, as already stated, in Pellon's name, and executions had been filed against this property under judgments against Pellon. Wilson and Pellon together conceived the idea (Pellon being in debt to Wilson in about $25,000) of getting a settlement with Pellon's creditors at fifty cents in the dollar; and, in order to carry this plan into execution, they contemplated a sale to Ward of Wilson's interest in section 25, which Ward was most anxious to buy. Pellon was then to transfer section 23 to Wilson, and himself drop out. The letter in question was a letter addressed to Pellon's creditors generally, and it stated that Pellon had sold his interest in section 23 to Ward in May, and suggested the likelihood of Ward cancelling his agreement on the return of what he had paid. Pellon and Ward were both aware of the terms of this letter, and the fact that Pellon allowed the despatch of the letter, in these terms, without exception, is relied upon as an admission by him as to the nature of the transaction of May. Whether or not his conduct constitutes an admission, depends entirely on the circumstances; because the statement itself could only be evidence against him as imparting significance to his conduct. It must be remembered that Pellon had, by his letter of the 21st of August, taken up his position. Ward had not answered the letter, and if Pellon's evidence is credible, he had, on the occasion of Pellon's visit to him, acted as if he accepted Pellon's view of the transaction of May. Pellon's evidence is explicit that there was an understanding, between him and Ward, that Ward would accept the redemption money of $1,840, while he, on his part, had promised to sell section 23 to Ward on terms to be arranged. Pellon says that Ward offered him $43 an acre; Ward admits that there was some such understanding, but treats the subject with his usual lack of candour. At one time he says he is unable to remember whether or not he offered Pellon $43 an acre, at another that he made such an offer, but that the offer was conditional. Again he admits that he knew Mr. Mavor and Pellon believed that he was going to assent to a fresh arrangement, but avers that he himself had no intention of doing so. Pellon's evidence as touching the letter is that when it was read to him, he raised, in Ward's presence, the question of the suitability of the expressions now relied upon on behalf of Ward, but that, in view of the understanding with Ward, the letter was not thought to be calculated to mislead the creditors to their prejudice. Pellon says that from time to time the subject of the arrangements about section 23 was opened up with Ward, but that Ward insisted on postponing it until the title to section 25 was settled.\nIn May, 1928, after the creditors had been paid, and the title to section 25 transferred to him, Ward, for the first time, since the letter of August 11, declared to Pellon that he was the owner of section 23. The view of the learned trial judge is expressed in these words:\nI am satisfied that the characteristic that distinguished Ward in the witness box is one of his natural characteristics and that he is not frank, and I am satisfied that he was not frank with Pellon. I accept Pellon's evidence, because, while it was not admitted by Ward, Ward finally, after being closely examined and being closely pressed by Counsel, finally admitted that he had some discussion with Pellon about a new agreement, but he was not prepared to admit that Pellon was right in saying that they were to agree to the terms upon which he would buy the land. His statement was, that if he felt like it and if he was well off and felt himself well off, or something to that effect, he might, out of generosity, pay Pellon something. I am satisfied that Pellon is telling substantially the truth as to what took place and that Ward hedged and evaded Pellon until he had secured the title to 25 and that he was anxious to do that and that he paid the money voluntarily, his main motive was to get the title to 25 and after he had obtained the title to 25, then he was prepared to stand strictly upon what he considered to be his legal rights and he is standing on those legal rights to-day.\nI see no reason to disagree with this, and in this view the letter of November, 1927, is of little importance. All this has a bearing upon another aspect, also, of the case, which has been emphasized by the defence. On the 6th of October, 1927, a receiver by way of equitable execution was appointed, under one of the judgments against Pellon, to receive \"the rents, profits and moneys whether payable as rent or purchase price\" in respect of sections 23 and 25. In November, Ward entered into an agreement with the appellant and Pellon for the purchase of the appellant's interest in section 25, at the price of $15,000, payable in cash, and $6,000 in promissory notes. The intention was to apply the proceeds of this sale in liquidating the debts of Pellon who was thereafter to convey section 23 to the plaintiff, which was done. Ward paid the whole of the sum of $15,000 to the receiver or to the appellant's solicitors acting as receivers, and it is alleged that he also paid certain additional sums, which it is now contended could only have been payable under the alleged agreement of May. As to this, it is to be observed that Ward, as lessee, was responsible for the payment to Pellon of one-half of the threshed crop on both properties in each year, and, as one-quarter of the crop was payable to the Indian Department, on account of the lessor, the net rental in kind receivable by Pellon under the lease was one-fourth of the crop of 1927, which it appears was not threshed until the summer of 1928. Ward, it should be observed, claimed that the effect of the document of May, 1927, was to put an end to the lease. Obviously, it had no such effect. Ward was not, on his own construction of it, entitled to a transfer of section 23 until the whole of the purchase money had been paid. Until then, he was entitled, under the agreement, neither to possession nor to the benefit of the rents or profits. In December, he estimated the value of the crop on section 23 as $12,000, out of which Pellon would be entitled to $3,000 as his share after the payment of the share due to the Government; as to the value of the crop on section 25, we have no information.\nWard, it is to be observed in this connection, did not carry out the terms of the agreement of the 13th of May, even on his own construction of them. According to that construction, $5,000 was payable on the 1st of December. Ward paid $2,000 to the receiver by a cheque, expressed to be in payment of this sum of $5,000, after deducting $3,000, described as payable to the Indian Department as the Government's share of the crop. On Ward's own construction of the document, this sum of $3,000, which would be payable out of Pellon's share of the crop, was plainly not deductable from the instalment payable under the agreement. For this deduction of $3,000 there was no excuse; and on his own view of the transaction of May, Ward was in default after the 1st of December.\nThe defence as based upon the alleged overpayments could only be sustained on the ground that they were made in circumstances such as to establish a fresh agreement, on the part of Pellon or the appellant, to sell the equity of redemption in section 23 on the terms of the document of May, or an equitable estoppel precluding the appellant from denying the existence of such an agreement. In order to reach such a conclusion, one must find that Pellon's conduct amounted to an assent to such a fresh agreement, or that it was of such a character as to make it a fraud on his part to deny the existence of such an agreement. Willmott v. Barber[22].\nIn examining Pellon's and the appellant's conduct, it must not be forgotten that the respondent, as he admits, was aware that Pellon and the appellant believed that the respondent had agreed to accept the redemption price of section 23, on the understanding that there was to be a fresh agreement for sale, on terms to be agreed upon, while he, the respondent, had no intention of carrying out such an arrangement; and that, such being the state of mind of the parties, this matter of section 23 had, at the repeated suggestion of the respondent, been allowed to stand until the title to section 25 was cleared up. In light of this, and of Ward's default in the payment due (as he alleges) on the 1st of December, and in view of the passage in the judgment of the trial judge just quoted, it would be impossible to hold that the respondent was misled by any conduct of Pellon or the appellant into thinking that they were assenting to a fresh agreement to deal with the equity of redemption in section 23 on the terms of the document of May. The truth obviously is, as the learned judge finds, that the respondent believed he had a binding agreement for sale under that document, which he intended to assert, and was not in any way influenced, in his course of conduct, by anything which either the appellant or Pellon did. I agree with the learned trial judge that the appellant's rights are not prejudiced by any of the transactions subsequent to May.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs, both here and in the Appellate Division, and the judgment of the trial judge restored.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\n[1] 24 Alta.

Taylor (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nFrank Scott Taylor (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1929 May 15; 1929: June 13.\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Mignault, Newcombe, Rinfret and Smith JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING\u2019S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nDomicile\u2014Intention of the party\u2014Marriage outside of the province\u2014Circumstances\u2014Change of domicile\u2014Matrimonial status\u2014Whether common or separate as to property\u2014Evidence\u2014Burden of proof\u2014Art. 80 CC.\nThe appellant was born on June 30, 1865, in Mosquito, Newfoundland, where his parents were domiciled. He remained there until 1886, when he went to La Have River, in Nova Scotia, in order to seek better employment as a mechanic. Then he worked his way on a ship to Sidney, Cape Breton and from there went to Montreal in October, 1886. He obtained employment in the Grand Trunk Railway Company\u2019s shops and boarded with a distant relative of his father. Some months later, he changed to one of the shops of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company in Montreal. He went to Toronto, worked there for a time and returned to Montreal, obtaining employment in another shop of the Canadian Pacific Railway. He then represented to his father and mother the advantages they would secure by coming to Montreal. The result was that, in 1887, the whole family came to Montreal, with the exception of a married sister who remained in the homestead; but she also came to Montreal the following year, the family home being rented to a neighbour. The father took a house in Montreal and the appellant boarded with him. In 1889, the father and mother decided to return to Newfoundland but failed to do so on account of the father\u2019s illness and subsequent death. In July, 1889, the appellant went to Newfoundland and married at Carbonnear the respondent\u2019s mother. He told the officiating minister that he came from Montreal and the marriage certificate describes him as \u201cof Montreal, P.Q.\u201d After the marriage, the appellant and his wife went to Halifax; and, there being no work there, they both came on to Montreal where they lived until the death of appellant\u2019s wife. It is also in evidence that, after her death, the appellant caused an inventory to be made before a notary \u201cof the community of property which formerly existed between him and his said late wife.\u201d\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Q.O.R. 45 K.B. 184), Newcombe and Smith JJ. dissenting, that all the circumstances of the case point to the fact that the appellant had abandoned his domicile of origin and had made Montreal his new domicile. (Art. 80 C.C.\nPer Newcombe and Smith JJ. (dissenting)\u2014Upon the evidence, it must be held that, up to the time of the marriage, there had been no change of domicile. The burden of establishing as a fact the acquisition of a new domicile and the abandonment of the domicile of origin by the appellant was on the respondent and he has not discharged it. The evidence must be \u201cunmistakable * * * that the party who has the domicile of origin intends to part with it * * *.\u201d (The Lauderdale Peerage, 10 App. Cas. 692).\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, Surveyer J.\u2014The appeal to the appellate court was upon leave of appeal granted by that court[2].\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nCharles Laurendeau K.C. and E. G. Place K.C. for the appellant.\nT. Fortin K.C. and Lorenzo Prince for the respondent. The judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C. and Mignault and Rinfret JJ.) was delivered by\nMignault J.\u2014This is a suit between father and son, the latter asking for an account of the administration of his father who had been appointed his tutor during his minority. The father confessed judgment, agreeing to render an account, but the account set up by him denied that he owed anything to his son, claiming on the contrary that the latter was indebted to him for maintenance and education until he reached the age of majority, for which the father reserved all his rights. This account was contested by the son.\nThe whole point in dispute is whether the appellant (the father) married his first wife, Dame Jael Davis, the respondent\u2019s mother, under the matrimonial r\u00e9gime of community of property, and that question in turn depends upon whether the appellant had lost his domicile of origin in Newfoundland and had acquired a domicile in the province of Quebec at the date of his first marriage.\nAt the trial the parties requested the court to decide first what was the domicile of the appellant at the time of his first marriage, and they admitted that according to the law of Newfoundland, at that date, the consorts would have been separate as to property, and that if, at the same date, the appellant had acquired a domicile in the province of Quebec, his matrimonial status would be that of community of property under the laws of that province. The Superior Court (Surveyer J.) found that the appellant had acquired a domicile in Montreal at the date of his first marriage, and maintained the respondent\u2019s contestation of the account. This judgment was affirmed by the Court of King\u2019s Bench, Mr. Justice Hall dissenting[3].\nThe appellant was born in Mosquito (now Bristol\u2019s Hope), Newfoundland, on June 30, 1865. He remained in Newfoundland until 1886, having worked at different places as a mechanic. He then, when aged 21, left that colony, seeking better employment, for, he says, he was a good mechanic, and he started at the bottom of the ladder and climbed up; that was his intention. On leaving Newfoundland he went first to Nova Scotia, at La Have River, and from there worked his way to Sidney, Cape Breton. He came to Montreal in October, 1886, where he obtained employment in the Grand Trunk shops and boarded with a distant relative of his father, a Mr. Edgecombe, on St. David street. Some months later, he changed to one of the shops of the Canadian Pacific Railway in Montreal. He says he also went to Toronto and worked there a couple of weeks, and then returned to Montreal, obtaining employment in another shop of the Canadian Pacific. From that time he remained in Montreal. He was in communication with his father and mother, brothers and sisters, and he told them of the advantages they would secure by coming to Montreal. The result was that the whole family came to Montreal, with the exception of a married sister who remained in the family home which the family continued to keep in Newfoundland, and sold some years later. The father took a house in Montreal and the appellant boarded with him.\nIn July, 1889, while still in the employment of the Canadian Pacific, the appellant went to Newfoundland and married at Carbonnear his first wife, Jael Davis, the respondent\u2019s mother. He told the officiating minister that he came from Montreal and the marriage certificate describes him as \u201cof Montreal, P.Q.\u201d After the marriage, the appellant says he and his wife went to Halifax. There was no work there, so they both came on to Montreal where they lived thereafter until the first wife died. The children of the first marriage were born in Montreal. Some point is made in the evidence of the fact that the appellant\u2019s mother returned to Newfoundland, the father having died in Montreal. The mother however died in Montreal some years later. I do not think that the movements of the appellant\u2019s family are very material, but perhaps some significance may be placed on the fact that the appellant had caused them to come on to Montreal shortly after he had established himself there. He was apparently ambitious and eager to succeed, and he remained where work was available.\nThe testimony at the trial was mainly that of the appellant himself, as well as of his sister, Mrs. Peacock, and his brother, J. L. Taylor. Mrs. Peacock, who was in Montreal when the appellant went to Newfoundland in the summer of 1889, says he went there to be married to a girl whom he had known all his life, that he was absent from Montreal about three weeks, and that while he was away the family moved into a larger house in Montreal so as to be able to accommodate him and his wife on their arrival. This testimony is corroborated by the brother. The appellant denies in his testimony that he went to Newfoundland with the intention of marrying, but perhaps more weight may be placed on what he actually did, than on what he now states was his intention.\nSome years after his marriage, the appellant opened a grocery business in Montreal which appears to have prospered, for he was able to purchase a corner property on Rosel street.\nAfter the death of his first wife, the appellant caused an inventory to be made, before Cushing, N.P.,\nof the community of property which formerly existed between him and his said late wife.\nThis the appellant did in his own name and also as tutor of his minor children among whom the respondent was the eldest. It is not necessary to treat this inventory as an admission by the appellant of what is really a question of law, namely, the legal effect of his first marriage, but it is a circumstance which along with others may help to show that the appellant had chosen Montreal as his home when he brought his first wife there.\nOn the evidence adduced the two courts have found that at the time of his first marriage (he remarried after his first wife\u2019s death), the appellant had changed his domicile from Mosquito, Newfoundland, to Montreal. Change of domicile involves a question of fact and requires actual residence in another place coupled with the intention of the person to make it the seat of his principal establishment (art. 80 C.C.). Proof of intention results from the declarations of the person and from the circumstances of the case (art. 81 C.C.).\nObviously the declarations must be contemporaneous ones, and not those which a party may make as a witness at the trial. It is argued that a declaration of intention may be found in the marriage certificate which states that Thomas Munden Taylor was \u201cof Montreal\u201d. But standing by itself it is not conclusive or unequivocal, for it may indicate a mere residence. The circumstances of the case, however, all point to the fact that the appellant had chosen Montreal as his new home, and his bringing his wife there, after an unsuccessful attempt to find work in Halifax, strongly points to an existing intention on his part to abandon his domicile of origin. After his first marriage, he says he went three times to Newfoundland, the first time, he thinks, in 1910, the other times in 1914 and 1916, but as he was then in business in Montreal, these trips are without significance and do not weaken the inference that his home was in Montreal. Upon what is a question of fact, to wit, the abandonment by the appellant of his domicile of origin and his choice of a new domicile in Montreal, the two courts are in agreement. They do not appear to have taken an incorrect view of the problem before them, and I would not feel justified in interfering with their judgments.\nThe appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nSmith J. (Newcombe J. concurring and both dissenting):\u2014This case turns entirely on the determination of the question of fact as to whether or not the appellant, Thomas M. Taylor, had changed his domicile at the time of his marriage to the respondent\u2019s mother in 1889 from Newfoundland, where he was born, to Montreal, in the province of Quebec. His parents were domiciled in Newfoundland, where the appellant was born on 30th June, 1865, and where he remained until 1886, when he went to the La Have river, in Nova Scotia, and worked his way on a ship to Sydney, Cape Breton, and from there went to Montreal in October of that year. He obtained work in Montreal on the Grand Trunk Railway and the Canadian Pacific Railway; but went to Toronto and worked there for a time, and returned to Montreal.\nHe represented to his father and mother that work could be had in Montreal, and in 1887 the father, mother, one sister and five brothers went up to Montreal and took residence there. The homestead in Newfoundland was left in possession of a married sister, but she also came to Montreal the following year, and the homestead was then rented to a neighbour until it might be required. In 1889 the father and mother resolved to return to Newfoundland and to take some of the family with them. The mother started back in June, but took ill on the way, and returned to Montreal, but she and two younger brothers and the appellant proceeded to Newfoundland some time in July of that year. The father was unable to go with them, because he had fallen ill, and the mother later on had to return to look after the sick husband, who died in October at Montreal.\nThe married sister who came up in 1889 remained in Montreal. The other sister apparently remained with the sick father, and became Mrs. Peacock, but at what time we are not informed. One brother had gone to the United States prior to 1889, two had returned to Newfoundland with the mother; there is no definite information as to the other two, but presumably they remained in Montreal. What seems definite and undisputed is that the father and mother had decided to return permanently to Newfoundland in 1889 with the members of the family still dependent on them, and that this intention was not carried out solely because of the father\u2019s illness, and subsequent death in October of that year. It is clear, therefore, that when the mother and two younger brothers went to Newfoundland along with the appellant, there was a definite intention, so far as the father and mother were concerned, to return permanently to their home in Newfoundland with the members of the family then dependent on them.\nIt is necessary, however, to examine other evidence in order to arrive at a conclusion as to the intentions at that time of the appellant. It is contended, on behalf of the respondent, that when leaving for Newfoundland he left with the definite intention of marrying the plaintiff\u2019s mother and bringing her back to Montreal, to resume his residence there, and that therefore, before the marriage, he had elected to change his domicile to the city of Montreal. The examination for discovery of the defendant was put in as evidence on behalf of the plaintiff and at p. 22 of this evidence there is the following:\nQ. Did you go to Newfoundland about the 28th, 29th, 30th or 31st of July, 1889?\nA. I got it marked down in my bible at home the year I was married, and I went down there, but I did not intentionally go to get married, although I got married when there, and I saw that there was no work there.\nBy the court:\u2014\nQ. Between 1886 and July 1889, did you return to Newfoundland?\nA. No, I did not go back; I went back in 1889 when I got married, but I did not know I was going to get married. I went down with my mother and two younger brothers. His evidence is also that, after arriving at St. John\u2019s by boat, he stayed there about a week, then went to Carbonear, where he met the lady that he married, and where he remained probably a week. Then there is the question:\nQ. How long before getting married did you propose to your lady?\nA. I just met the girl, I had gone to school with her, and I said, \u201cWill you marry me?\u201d She said \u201cYes.\u201d\nAfter the marriage, he went immediately to St. John\u2019s. On cross-examination, he testified that on going back to Newfoundland prior to being married, he tried to get work in Angel\u2019s Foundry in St. John\u2019s, and after his marriage he tried to get into the dry-dock, but failed; that then he decided to take the Peruvian for Halifax and endeavour to do better there, but he failed to find work there, and went back to Montreal. He says that he had gone to school with the respondent\u2019s mother, but during the three years that he was away before returning to Newfoundland in 1889, he had only written one letter to her.\nThe respondent then puts in the evidence of Mrs. Peacock, the appellant\u2019s sister, which is the evidence mainly relied on to sustain the respondent\u2019s case. She apparently lived with her father and mother up to the time of the father\u2019s death in October, 1889, after the appellant\u2019s marriage, and no doubt had it not been for her father\u2019s illness she would have returned with him and the mother to Newfoundland in 1889, but she is not asked as to this, and there is no evidence upon the point beyond the inference that may be drawn from the fact that she was living with him as a member of his household. She states that the mother and two younger brothers went down to Newfoundland with the appellant in July, 1889, with the intention of remaining there, and that the father intended to go back but was prevented by his illness, and died in October. She says that the appellant had known the respondent\u2019s mother all his life and that she had one letter from her in two years.\nBy the court:\nQ. Did you know your brother intended to get married to her in Newfoundland?\nA. Yes, we had all that intention.\nBy defendant\u2019s counsel:\nQ. What did you know about his intention?\nA. That is his intention, and he told us.\n* * * * * By the court:\nQ. Talked in the family?\nA. Yes, and I was the one who got the larger house, so as he would come and live with us.\nBy defendant\u2019s counsel:\nQ. You got the larger house?\nA. My father and I.\n* * * * *\nBy the court:\nQ. When he came back, the house was all ready to receive his wife and himself?\nBy the court:\nQ. Rented in July or August?\nA. I believe in August.\nBy the court:\nQ. After the marriage or before?\nA. Just about that time, but we intended to have him come back with his wife to stay with us.\nThe reliability of these statements must be tested by reference to what this witness previously swore to as stated above, namely, that in June of that year the father and mother had decided to go back permanently to Newfoundland; that with that intention the mother and two younger brothers did return to Newfoundland along with the appellant in July, and that the father only remained behind because of his illness. It seems to me, therefore, that there can be no truth in her statement that in August she and the father were getting a larger house because there was going to be one more person in the family, in the person of appellant\u2019s wife. It is not possible to reconcile this story with the unquestioned fact deposed to by herself and the other witnesses that at that time the father had a fixed intention of leaving Montreal and returning permanently to Newfoundland where his wife and two young children had already gone. It was not till October that this intention was abandoned because of the father\u2019s continued illness and that a telegram was sent to the mother to come back. The father certainly moved to new premises in August, because appellant, on his return, had difficulty in locating him, but it is evident that the change was not made with the object of accommodating the larger family since he had no intention then of remaining in Montreal himself.\nThe story of this witness as to it being understood in the family that appellant was going to marry plaintiff\u2019s mother, and that he left for Newfoundland in July, 1889, with that intention, seems a very improbable one in the light of her own evidence as well as the other evidence.\nWhen appellant left Newfoundland in 1886 he was just twenty-one and had been drifting about since serving his apprenticeship, working at different places, at blacksmithing and at fishing with his father. He left seeking work with no fixed idea as to the kind of work he would take up or as to his ultimate destination. No one says he was engaged to the lady before leaving and no one is asked as to that. This sister says she and the lady were great friends and she had only one letter from her in the two years between the time she left Newfoundland and the marriage which seems a very meagre correspondence with a great friend, and prospective sister-in-law.\nThe appellant giving evidence for plaintiff is asked by the court if he had carried on no correspondence with his future wife, and he says he wrote her just once during the three years. It seems very improbable that if there was an understanding in the family that appellant was going to marry this lady, the correspondence should be limited to these two letters. I think this sister\u2019s evidence on this point no more reliable than her evidence that at the time her father was intending to leave Montreal and join his wife and family permanently in Newfoundland he was renting a larger house with a view of taking appellant and his wife in as boarders in Montreal.\nTurning, then, to the evidence of the brother, J. L. Taylor, also called on behalf of the plaintiff, he is asked if he heard Mrs. Peacock\u2019s evidence, and if he corroborates it, and his answer is,\nA. As far as I know; my brother and sister covered all the information I could render in this case.\n* * * * *\nBy the court:\nQ. Do you remember your brother leaving for Newfoundland in 1889 with your mother and two brothers?\nA. Yes.\nBy the court:\nQ. What did they leave for?\nA. They went down with the intention of staying, and my father was to join them in October, but unfortunately they had to telegraph her and bring her back, and she came back two weeks before he died.\n* * * * * By the court:\nQ. What was your brother\u2019s intention?\nA. My brother had perhaps two or three intentions; I do not just know what happened at the time. As far as I understand they covered all the information I could render.\nBy the court:\nQ. Was there any talk of his marriage when he left?\nA. Naturally, as far as I know; I could not say as much as the others.\nOn cross-examination:\nQ. You said that your brother had perhaps two or three intentions; what do you mean by that?\nA. I remember at the time, because one of my brothers had gone to the United States, and if he struck anything worth while down there, the probabilities were he would remain.\nThe \u201che\u201d in this answer means appellant as appears from the next question and anwer.\nQ. What do you mean by \u201cdown there\u201d?\nA. That is in Newfoundland or anywhere else where he might strike a position that would be of service; better than he might locate in Montreal; at that time we were all liable to move here, there and everywhere.\nQ. At that time none of you were particularly settled anywhere?\nA. No, we were largely boarding at home with our parents, but he had not bought any furniture or established himself anywhere.\nAll this evidence is by the plaintiff\u2019s own witnesses, and to my mind, if it establishes anything, it is that up to the time of the marriage there was no change of domicile. The burden of establishing as a fact the acquisition of a new domicile and the abandonment of the domicile of origin by the appellant was on the plaintiff, and the nature of the evidence required for that purpose is clearly set out in the appellant\u2019s factum in the quotation set out from The Lauderdale Peerage[4] (1885), as follows:\nThe extent to which the evidence must be carried to put an end to the domicile of origin is explained in clear terms in the Countess of Dalhousie v. McDonall[5], and in Munro v. Munro[6]. It is not upon light evidence or upon a light presumption that we must act, but it must clearly appear by unmistakable evidence that the party who has the domicile of origin intends to part with it and intends to establish his domicile elsewhere.\nIn my view, the appeal should be allowed width costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Foster, Place, Hackett, Mulvena, Hackett & Foster.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Tancr\u00e8de Fortin.\n[1] (1928) Q.O.R. 45 K.B. 184.\n[2] (1928) Q.O.R. 44 K.B. 204.\n[3] Q.O.R. 45 K.B. 184.\n[4] (1885) 10 App. Cas. 692, at p. 758\n[5] (1840) 7 C. & F. 817.\n[6] (1840) 7 C. & F. 842.\n",

VII, c. 61, now R.S.C., 1927, c. 207.\nThe appellant insurance company, having paid the sum of $17,141.80 to the owners of a cargo of wheat destroyed in transit from Port Colborne to Montreal on a vessel, the ss. Hamilton, owned by the respondent company, and having been subrogated to the rights of the owners, brought action and recovered judgment in the trial court against the respondent for that amount which represented the value of the cargo accepted by the respondent as a common carrier and which it failed to deliver to the owners. The accident to the Hamilton occurred in the St. Lawrence River, below Cornwall, Ontario, and: was caused by the breaking of a threaded wrought iron bolt which entered a turnbuckle, the appliance being used to connect one of the chains of the steering apparatus to the port end of the quadrant attached to the rudder. According to the evidence, this bolt had been considerably bent at least for several months before it broke during the sixth trip of the season. The judgment of the trial judge in favour of the appellant was reversed by the appellate court, Tellier J. dissenting, on the ground that the respondent had established the statutory defences allowed it by sections 6 and 7 of the Water Carriage of Goods Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 207.\nHeld that, upon the evidence, the appellate court was not justified in reversing the finding of the trial judge that the respondent has not established that it had \u201cexercised due negligence to make the ship in all respects seaworthy and properly * * * equipped\u201d, and that the loss or damage was occasioned by a \u201clatent defect\u201d in the material of the bolt.\nPer Anglin C.J.C. and Rinfret, Lamont and Smith JJ.\u2014The burden of proving absence of fault or negligence, the cause of the damage or loss, and that that cause was a latent defect, is cast by the law upon the defendant as a common carrier seeking to avail itself of the protection of sections 6 and 7 of the Water Carriage of Goods Act; and, per Anglin C.J.C. and Rinfret and Lamont JJ., the respondent, by establishing that there was a latent defect in the material of the bolt and that it was a probable cause of its breaking, did not discharge that burden unless the evidence also excluded other possible causes.\nPer Anglin C.J.C. and Rinfret, Lamont and Smith JJ.\u2014The respondent company pleaded that it had \u201cexercised due diligence * * *\u201d and \u201calternatively, that the steering apparatus broke as a result of a latent defect in the material * * *,\u201d such plea apparently assuming that the respondent might escape liability by proving only one of the two allegations. If so, the plea is defective in that the statutory requirement is that both conditions, not one or the other, shall be established in order to make good the defence.\nPer Anglin C.J.C. and Rinfret, Lamont and Smith JJ.\u2014The certificates of seaworthiness given by two government officers are of no value as affording any proof of \u201cdue diligence\u201d in inspection. One of them whose duty it was to inspect boilers and machinery \u201cincluding the steering apparatus\u201d testified that it was none of his business to see to the condition of the steering chains and that his duties ended with the engines which operated them. The other inspector, whose duty it was to ascertain the condition of the ship\u2019s hull and equipment for seaworthiness testified to having seen the steering apparatus, but did not notice the turnbuckle bolt and did not know of its existence until he heard of it at the trial.\nPer Anglin C.J.C. and Rinfret, Lamont and Smith JJ.\u2014The terms \u201cnot apparent\u201d and \u201clatent\u201d are not interchangeable; they are by no means equivalents, as some defects, although not apparent, cannot properly be said to be latent. Moreover, it cannot be assumed that if due diligence is exercised any defect not thereby discernible must be \u201clatent,\u201d as the fact that the statute requires that after proof of the exercise of due diligence the ship\u2019s owner must also establish, when he relies on that fact, that the defect which caused the damage was \u201clatent,\u201d seems to indicate that such an assumption must be fallacious.\nNewcombe J. upheld the finding of the trial judge that the owner failed in due diligence to have the ship seaworthy and properly equipped, and held that the respondent company did not therefore bring itself within the relief of the statute.\nJudgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Q.R. 46 K.B. 305) reversed.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec[1] reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, de Lorimier J.

Lynch-Staunton for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C. and Rinfret and Lamont JJ.) was delivered by\nAnglin C.J.C.\u2014The plaintiffs are an insurance company, which is subrogated to the rights of the owners of a cargo of wheat destroyed in transit from Port Colborne to Montreal on a vessel, the ss. Hamilton, owned by the defendant. The plaintiffs paid the sum of $17,141.80 to the owners of the cargo and they recovered judgment in this action for that amount against the defendant in the Superior Court. This judgment was, however, reversed by the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Tellier, J., diss.), on the ground that the defendant had established the statutory defences allowed it by ss. 6 and 7 of the Water Carriage of Goods Act, 1910, 9-10 Edw. 7, c. 61 (now c. 207 of R.S.C., 1927), which it invoked. Section 6 reads as follows:\n6. If the owner of any ship transporting merchandise or property from any port in Canada exercises due diligence to make the ship in all respects seaworthy and properly manned, equipped and supplied, neither the ship nor the owner, agent or charterer shall become or be held responsible for loss or damage resulting from faults or errors in navigation or in the management of the ship, or from latent defect. The accident to the Hamilton occurred in the St. Lawrence river, below Cornwall, Ont., on the night of the 26th of June, 1924, and was caused by the breaking of a threaded wrought iron bolt which entered a turnbuckle, the appliance being used to connect one of the chains of the steering apparatus to the port end of a quadrant attached to the rudder. This bolt had been considerably bent at least for several months before it broke during the sixth trip of the season.\nThe present action, in assertion of the owner\u2019s right, was brought to recover the value of the cargo accepted by the defendant as a common carrier which it failed to deliver to the owner. Recognizing that, if it would escape liability as a common carrier, it must assume the burden of establishing the facts necessary to make either s. 6 or s. 7 applicable, the defendant pleaded that it had\nexercised due diligence to make the ship in all respects seaworthy and properly manned, equipped and supplied;\nthat\nthe breaking of the steering apparatus occurred without (its) actual fault or privity or without the fault or neglect of (its) agents, servants or employees (s. 7)\nand,\nalternatively, that the said steering apparatus broke as a result of a latent defect in the material forming the screw in the turnbuckle used to operate the rudder of said vessel, which said latent defect was not and could not be known to the defendant or its employees notwithstanding due diligence to make the said vessel seaworthy in all respects and properly manned, equipped and supplied.\nThis plea apparently assumes that the defendant might succeed by proving either the exercise of \u201cdue diligence, etc.\u201d or that the defect which caused the break was \u201clatent\u201d. That must be the meaning of pleading the latter fact \u201calternatively\u201d. If so, we think the plea defective in that the statutory requirement is that both conditions, not one or the other, shall be established in order to make good the defence, there being no suggestion in the present case that the loss or damage resulted from\nfaults or errors in navigation or in the management of said vessel.\nFor the purpose of the present appeal, however, we shall treat the defence as properly pleaded and as sufficiently raising the statutory issue under s. 6.\nAt the trial the defendant called two expert witnesses, one, F. O. Farey, chief chemist and engineer in charge of physical testing at the R. W. Hunt Company\u2019s offices, who had high academic degrees and twenty years\u2019 experience, for the purpose of proving that upon chemical analysis a certain proportion of phosphorus was discovered in the wrought iron of which the bolt was made. The proportion established by the witness, 189, is not seriously controverted. He, however, admits that the amount of phosphorus found would not, per se, justify condemnation of the iron, nor establish a probable cause of the bolt breaking. The danger, the witness says, of the presence of phosphorus depends upon the extent to which it is segregated. The defendant\u2019s other expert witness, Professor Roast, who is in charge of metalography at McGill University and a distinguished chemist and metallurgist of long experience, deposed that, as a result of microscopic examination by him with the aid of microphotography, he found such a segregation of phosphorus in the samples submitted to him as would indicate its presence to be highly dangerous and a probable cause of the breaking of the bolt. He produced ten photographs, eight of them taken at 100 diameters and at least one of which, he says, covered an actual area of the size of pin prick; in fact it is not clear that each of the eight is not limited to the area of a pin hole. On the segregation of phosphorus shewn in such microscopic areas he largely bases hie condemnation of the material in the bolt. He, however, was not able to say that this was in fact the cause of the bolt breaking. Indeed, he admits on cross-examination that the fact that a crack or defect occurred precisely at the point of indentation of the first thread affords an indication of some undue strain put upon it and a failure in resistance due to the presence of the threading\u2014\nit might be so and it might not be so. It does not follow necessarily, but it might easily be.\nOn the other hand, the plaintiff called Professor Mailhiot, of the Montreal Polytechnic School, an eminent metallurgist and chemist, who deposed that the amount of phosphorus shewn by chemical analysis was negligible; that the mottled areas appearing on the micro-photographic plates indicated the segregation of some impurities, which might or might not be phosphides; that microscopic examination of the samples themselves disclosed no evidence of any dangerous segregation of phosphides; but, on the contraty, that the samples, when examined under the microscope, proved to be comparatively free from traces of phosphides and approximated closely to the superior quality of \u201cengine bolt\u201d iron, and that, in his opinion, the iron was not inherently defective and any segregation shown was too slight to condemn the metal from that point of view. He added that\nthere is certainly no latent defect in the bar.\nProfessor Mailhiot further deposed that, when a wrought iron bolt, such as that in question, is bent so as to produce a curve of 15 degrees, small fissures usually result, visible to the eye; that such a bending or curving of the bolt would cause it to lose about two-thirds of its resisting strength and that, in his opinion, this physical injury, perfectly visible, was the most probable cause of the breaking of the bolt, especially having regard to the point at which such break occurred. The point of fracture is established by Hamelin, the engineer of the defendant, and Bingley, a local mechanic called in by it to make repairs, both of whom saw the broken bolt shortly after the fracture occurred. Hamelin says the fracture was in the threaded part of the bolt immediately inside the point at which it entered the turnbuckle, into which it was inserted; Bingley, that the fracture was at such point of entry or in the first or second thread of the screw immediately outside the turn-buckle, his impression being rather that it was precisely at the point of entry. No other witness whose testimony is of value gave evidence on this point.\nProfessor Mailhiot\u2019s evidence was fully corroborated by A. G. Spencer, an American metallurgist of distinction and a graduate of McGill University in Applied Science, who was chief chemist and director of the testing department of the Canadian Inspection and Testing Laboratories for seven years, metallurgist for Peter Lyall & Sons, Ltd., from 1917 to the end of the war, and subsequently metallurgist for the Steel Company of Canada, at Montreal, until the present year. This witness made a microscopic examination of the metal in question. He says it was \u201ca good grade of merchant bar iron\u201d; that the presence of phosphorus and even of phosphides, to some extent segregated, is common to all wrought iron; and that a mottled structure may, or may not, indicate a segregation of phosphides; it may be wholly or partly due to other impurities. The photographs produced by Professor Roast, he adds, do not indicate the wrought iron to be defective. Speaking of the effect of threading a bolt and of a bend afterwards made in it while cold, he says:\nthe tendency would be for an initial crack to develop which will gradually extend into the mass of the metal until a fracture occurs;\nthat the bolt will be weakened against a vertical strain owing to tension of the fibres on the convex side and compression of them on the concave side. The witness adds that when a bolt is bent in its threaded part it is a very dangerous practice to use it, especially if it is held firmly in the screw of a turnbuckle, the sharp threads being the initial starting point for cracks. He adds that, while phosphorus is a disadvantage, if present in an excessive amount, the chemical analysis in the present case does not shew such an excess. He also says that\nany bar of the same quality, or, in some cases which I have tested myself, material of better quality, will break under as nearly identical conditions as I could get.\nFinally he says:\nI have come to a very definite, decided opinion that the cause of the breaking was not due to chemical defects, nor to a latent defect, but it was due to the rank physical abuse which the threaded bolt had received.\nAnother expert witness called by the plaintiff in rebuttal was James R. Donald, chemical engineer, a graduate of McGill University in Arts and Applied Science, who says:\nThere was nothing in my examination which indicated anything in the metal which could cause it to break under normal stress or strain.\nSpeaking of the effect of the turnbuckle on a bolt, he says:\nThe metal inside the nut is held firmly in the nut, and when the threaded portion outside the nut is bent, the fibres cannot stretch at the nut and therefore part developing the crack, and the fracture as seen at the top. On the other side the fibres come into compression resulting in more or less bursting apart of the metal.\nThe small cracks, which, when they first appear, are barely visible, he says are\nvery dangerous because they may go deep, and because you have lost that much strength at the top of the bolt, and, if a further bending stress comes, you get the tearing effect * * *. It is very much like taking a pencil and bending it. If you bend that, it starts to break here (indicating). It takes very little to finish it. It gives way in tension.\nHe adds that a pull in the direction of the bend, if heavy enough\nwill continue to bend (sic) (extend?) the crack until the bar gives way.\nIn his opinion, as the result of his investigations, no piece of wrought iron threaded with bolt attached, and with a bend, can be expected to carry anything like a full load, that is the load it would normally carry if unbent.\nHe would consider it dangerous and unsafe with any appreciable load; and would regard the load which was put upon the bolt in question as appreciable. In his opinion any merchant bar iron would shew phosphide areas on microscopic examination to as great an extent as the bar in question. As to the manganese content, it was only 17\/100 ths of 1%, whereas the specifications of the American Society for Testing Materials, places the maximum manganese content allowable at 30\/100 ths. The mottled appearance in the photographs, he says, indicates\nimpurities in the metal which are always more or less segregated to a greater or less extent,\nand which may or may not be phosphorus. Phosphorus in wrought iron is not a defect. You cannot get wrought iron without it. Provided the amount of phosphorus is great enough, segregation of it may be dangerous. In the present instance he agreed with Mr. Farey, whose analysis gives the proportion of phosphorus as 189; but, he adds, he does not\nthink that amount of phosphorus segregated or unsegregated would seriously affect the metal.\nFinally, he points out that the bolt could not originally have had any set or bend such as existed for some time prior to the breaking of it, because\nyou could not get the nut (turnbuckle) over the (bent) thread.\nMr. Robert Job, consulting chemist, of the city of Montreal, and a graduate of Harvard College, when asked whether the break in the bar could be caused by chemical or physical action, said,\nWithout any question it was caused by physical cause. Here is the evidence of it right in the piece;\nrepeated strainings in the same direction gradually extended the initial crack more and more until it finally broke. A force, applied longitudinally after bending it\nwould tend to tear (the metal) apart just as a piece of paper that had been nicked would tear apart * * *. No good mechanic would bring a strain to bear under those conditions, a transverse strain where there was a sharp angle such as caused by the threading. The bolt is certain to tear just the same as if a piece of paper was nicked and torn. It would be absolutely unsafe.\nOf that there was\nno question in (his) mind. On any vessel that (he) was ever connected with, or any place of that kind, (he) would never for a minute leave a bolt in an important position of that kind, when (he) knew that that bolt had been strained in that manner;\nand it does not make any difference whether the bolt was bent by coming in contact with the bulkhead astern or whether it was bent by any other cause. He further adds:\nI do know that gripping a bolt in a turnbuckle would hold it rigidly, pretty much the same way that that nut holds upon that bolt. Then, if a blow or pressure were applied, on some other point, the effect would be to localize the stresses at the point just outside of the turnbuckle and that would be the place at which the fracture or crack would naturally occur.\nCaptain Reitch, an English master mariner, and Commander of the Canadian Victor, of the Canadian Government Merchant Marine, said:\nAny threaded bolt, in my opinion, is weakened by being bent cold,\nand adds that he would not permit such a bolt set in a turnbuckle to be used in a steering gear. He further says that it would be hard to discover an initial crack in such a bolt, when caused by bending, as it would be covered with oil or dirt to some extent and would need to be taken out to be examined for flaws, but that, even though no flaw were so discovered, he would condemn it and require to have it straightened or replaced.\nE. D. Walker, marine engineer, of Montreal, having seen the bolt in question, says,\nIf I had been responsible in authority and responsible for that, steering gear, I should certainly have condemned it for the simple reason that the turnbuckle is for straight line adjustment. It is impossible for it to function with a bend. * * * When bent, the molecules at the concave side are in compression and the molecules at the convex side are in tension. They cannot be said to be in equilibrium. The only way to get it back into equilibrium is by taking it out, getting it hot, and letting it cool slowly. * * * If that is not done, it would eventually go to breaking point. * * * If would ultimately give way, especially if those bends are more or less continuous.\nIt practically amounts to the same thing whether the bolt is exposed to repeated blows or to a continued series of shocks in the same direction. Then, he adds,\nthe bend of the bolt * * * is what, I think, caused the accident.\nH. M. McMaster, ship broker and sea captain, knows the Hamilton, having had her under his charge for about \u201cten or twelve years\u201d, when he was marine superintendent for the Montreal Transportation Company and was also acting for the defendant company as an adviser. Asked whether as superintendent of shipping companies, if he had found the bolt of the turnbuckle, obviously meant to be straight, in a bent condition, he would consider it good or not, he answers, after objection,\nI would not like a vessel to go to sea with that * * * \u2014go into operation anywhere.\nWilliam Harrison, a marine surveyor, condemned the arrangement of the turnbuckle and quadrant on the Hamilton.\nG. L. Hayes, also a marine surveyor, who specially examined the steering gear of the Hamilton at Montreal after the accident, deposes that the bend was certainly caused by contact with the bulkhead. Having seen the pieces of the broken bolt, he says he certainly would not have kept it in service.\nThis is one of the most vital parts of the ship\u2019s equipment and to say that a bent screw can be just as efficient as if it is straight is ridiculous.\nHe adds that\nwhen passing around the aft part of the boat, the thing would be quite obvious when the thing was hard over * * * you could not have failed to have seen it.\nHe draws the inference that the screw broke at the point of entry to the turnbuckle.\nCaptain Gray, who is the shipping master of the port of Montreal, and who examined the Hamilton while in Montreal and saw the pieces of broken bolt, when asked the conclusions to which he came after his examination of them, said that\nthe turnbuckle bolt had been bent by one of two reasons, firstly, by the possible striking of the bolt against the cast steel plate, secondly, by the extension of the turnbuckle screws allowing the head to protrude beyond the corner of the quadrant, being bent by the natural strain of steering the ship.\nHe then adds that the type of metal of which the bolt was made was usual and proceeds to say:\nQ. Supposing you were in command of a vessel and you noticed that, either suddenly, or over a period of time, a turnbuckle of that kind, used as it was, had become bent as it was, what would you have done, if anything?\nA. I would renew it at once.\nQ. Why?\nA. Because the thing is a source of danger in a bent condition.\n* * * * *\nQ. What would you say if that question were asked and not (so) answered in a Masters\u2019 and Mates\u2019 examination?\nA. Well, if I were asking a question of that kind to a candidate who was sitting for his Master\u2019s certificate and he told me in describing the condition of the bolt that he would go ahead with it, I think there is only one thing left open for me, and that is to ask him to go back to sea for six months to learn better. He continues:\nIf a man told me that he would go to sea on a boat and depend on the steering with a buckle like that, I should say he is wrong\u2014decidedly wrong.\nOn the other hand, John McLean, naval architect, of Montreal, who had some Scotch experience, says the steering apparatus of the Hamilton was \u201cin accordance with good practice\u201d and that the bend in the bolt would have no appreciable effect on its strength.\nW. I. Hay, principal surveyor of the British Corporation for the survey and register of shipping in Canada and the American Bureau of Shipping, who was responsible for the reconstruction of the Hamilton in 1922, when\nshe was lengthened and transformed from a barge into a twin screw steamer,\nand who reported on her when she got her certificate as a steamer, says the effect of the bend in the screw in the turnbuckle would be \u201cnegligible\u201d, although he admits that a\nrepeated impact on wrought iron in the shank of a bolt of that kind, a threaded shank * * * might have quite a lot of effect\nupon it.\nFrank T. Norris, district superintendent of the defendant company and a certified Canadian engineer, thought the bend \u201cinsignificant\u201d. He did not think it would affect the strength of the metal sufficiently to warrant doing anything with it.\nF. O. Farey, whose testimony has already been referred to, says that the break\nwas outside the maximum bend, and my observation indicated that it broke outside of any bend whatever, or any appreciable bend;\nthat the break\nindicated * * * a flaw in the metal, or in other words, an inherent defect.\nThat the bolt which broke had been bent or curved 15 degrees for a considerable period\u2014indeed for some time before the vessel began the voyage during which she met with disaster\u2014is now common ground having been admitted by the witness Norris, district superintendent of the defendant company, and by Hamelin, the engineer of the Hamilton, who deposed that, noticing the bend in the spring of 1924, he took the turnbuckle off and \u201cexamined\u201d the bolt and considered that it could safely be left to function. Hamelin apparently made this examina- tion without cleaning off the oil and dirt upon the bolt. Had he done so he would certainly have mentioned that fact.\nIt is also common ground that efficiency in a ship\u2019s steering apparatus is of vital importance to its seaworthiness and safety and it must be the subject of careful and exhaustive inspection before such seaworthiness can be said to be established or should be certified. It is likewise clearly established that the bend or curve in the bolt would have been plainly visible to any person making a reasonable inspection of the steering gear. Yet of two Government officers, who gave certificates of such seaworthiness \u2014much relied upon by the defendant\u2014one, whose duty was to inspect boilers and machinery \u201cincluding the steering apparatus,\u201d says that it was none of his business to see to the condition of the steering chains, that his duties ended with the engines which operated them. This witness also said that the bend was of no importance and that if he had seen it he would not have considered reporting it or ordering the replacement of the bolt; that it gave no warning of any danger. He guarded himself, however, by adding that he is not an expert in these matters. The other inspector, whose duty it was to ascertain the condition of the ship\u2019s hull and equipment for seaworthiness, saw the steering apparatus, and remarked that it was confined in too close quarters, though that was not, in his opinion, matter for objection; but he did not notice the turnbuckle bolt or the condition it was in at the time. He did not pay any particular attention to it when he inspected the vessel and did not see the bend. But, had he seen it as it appeared when shewn to him at the trial, he says he\nmight have raised an objection * * * might have asked them why they did not straighten that out.\nIn his view whether this coupling came under the control of the engineer is a nice question\u2014for him the straining point; but, although he said that the share in the inspection of the vessel taken by his fellow inspector, who worked together with him, was \u201ceverything that comes under the control of the engineer,\u201d he admits that he personally examined the steering gear, except the engine and its controls. He knew there was a turnbuckle only because he \u201cheard (about) it in Court;\u201d otherwise he \u201cwould not know it.\u201d It seems unnecessary to make further comment upon the value of the certificates issued by these two gentlemen, as affording any proof of \u201cdue diligence\u201d in inspection.\nThe only other expert inspection of which we are told was made by Captain Foote, who is engaged in marine survey work and marine insurance and inspected the Hamilton for \u201cclassification\u201d in the spring of 1924, when he had no criticism to make of the steering apparatus. This witness cannot remember whether or not there was an opening in the casing directly aft of, and in line with, the rudder post. He apparently did not notice the bent bolt. At all events he makes no allusion to it and was not asked as to the effect of its presence.\nThere is a considerable volume of evidence bearing on the question as to how the bend or curve came to be made in the bolt. Much of this evidence seems rather to indicate that it was due to the openings in the sides of the housing not being sufficient to permit clear play of the quadrant, with the result that whenever the rudder was put hard to starboard, the end of the quadrant being directed to port, the bolt or buckle came in contact with the steel housing and the bolt was thus bent. The mate, Dussault, admits that this actually occurred and that there had been for a long time a dent in the bulkhead at the point where the bolt or turnbuckle would hit it. But there is other evidence that the quadrant had sufficient clearance and that there was no such contact, and that the bending was caused by strain owing to the bolt protruding beyond the end of the quadrant and being bent around it as on a fulcrum by the pull of the chains. It is not necessary, however, to determine what was the actual cause of the bend. It suffices that the bolt in question, designed to be straight and, no doubt, straight when originally put in, had become considerably bent and was, in fact, so bent for some time prior to the commencement of the voyage on which the accident occurred, indicating the existence of a serious cause of trouble, which invited attention.\nThe trial judge found that the evidence as to the existence of the latent defect alleged by the defendant was contradictory. In his view the defendant had failed to establish either branch of its statutory defence. He proceeded, however, to find fault of the employees of the defendant consisting in lack of foresight and failure to take precautions and want of diligence. But he appears to rest his judgment rather on the defendant\u2019s failure to establish its statutory defence.\nIn the Court of King\u2019s Bench only one of the five learned judges who sat (Cannon J.A.) held the existence of the latent defect assigned and that it had caused the damage to be facts established in the defendant\u2019s favour.\nThe consid\u00e9rants of the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench were as follows:\nSeeing ss. 6 and 7 of the statute 9-10 Edw. VII, c. 61:\n(a) Considering that appellant exercised due diligence to make the vessel, ss. Hamilton, in all respects seaworthy and properly manned, equipped and supplied;\n(b) Considering that the proof does not establish that the accident, with resulting damage, was due to the fault and negligence of appellant, its agents, servants and employees, who had knowledge that the steering gear was defective; (sic)\n(c) Considering that it is not established that the fact that the bolt which failed was bent to the extent of fifteen degrees caused it to break and bring about the accident in question;\n(d) Considering that, if the accident resulted from a defect in the equipment of the steering gear, that defect was not apparent, and exercise of due diligence by appellant, or its servants and employees, did not and could not discover the defect;\n(e) Considering that appellant is entitled to the protection afforded by the sections 6 and 7 of the said statute;\nIt will be observed that in the consid\u00e9rant marked (b) the court deals with the case as if the burden were on the plaintiff to prove fault or negligence of the defendant or of its servants or agents. The burden to prove absence of such fault or negligence is cast by the law upon the defendant as a common carrier seeking to avail itself of the protection of s. 7 of the statute.\nOn consid\u00e9rant marked (c) a like observation may be made. The burden of proving what caused the damage or loss and that what caused it was a latent defect was on the defendant.\nIn consid\u00e9rant marked (d), the court seems to treat \u201cnot apparent\u201d and \u201clatent\u201d as interchangeable terms. They are by no means equivalents. Some defects, although not apparent, cannot properly be said to be latent. Moreover, the court seems to assume that if due diligence was exercised any defect not thereby discoverable must be \u201clatent\u201d. But the fact that the statute requires that after proof of the exercise of due diligence the ship\u2019s owner must also establish, when he relies on that fact, that the defect which caused the damage was \u201clatent\u201d, seems to indicate that this assumption must be fallacious. If, as seems to us most probable, the breaking of the bolt was due to weakness developed in it as a result of its being bent as it was, that bend being readily visible to any person making an examination of that part of the steering gear and having been actually known to the ship\u2019s engineer, it would seem to be beyond question that there had not been anything approaching due diligence to make the ship seaworthy. The duty of remedying the bend would have been imperative. Yet Captain Legault says there was a daily inspection of the ship!\nMr. Justice Greenshields, one of the majority, and who wrote most comprehensive \u201cnotes\u201d, says:\nI am disposed to express the opinion, that appellant (defendant) has not satisfactorily proved that the actual breaking of this bolt was due to a latent defect in the material of which it was composed. I do not, in my view of the case, consider it necessary to decide that question, either in the affirmative or in the negative.\nMr. Justice Bernier, also one of the majority, merely finds that the defendant exercised due diligence to make the vessel seaworthy and that the breaking of the bolt in question was accidental, but that the cause of it was some latent defect. No such defect other than that in the chemical composition of the material of which the bolt was made is alleged or suggested by the defendant. As to the particular latent defect so alleged, viz., an undue segregation of phosphorus in the metal, there was, in his opinion, \u201cdivergence entre les t\u00e9moins\u201d and he adds: \u201cil me semble inutile d\u2019analyser la preuve faite de part et d\u2019autre sur ce point.\u201d Mr. Justice Hall, also of the majority, says:\nThe burden of proof rests of course, upon the appellant (defendant) to establish the presumed (sic) latent defect, and, in view of the conflict of evidence it is impossible for this court to come to any other conclusion than that it has failed to discharge that burden.\nThat learned judge proceeds to discuss at length the probable cause of the bending of the bolt and concludes that a defect in the construction of the ship so that the bulkhead was set too close to the rudder head, contact of the quadrant therewith resulting, was not established. He concludes that \u201cthe appellant (defendant) did exercise due diligence to make this vessel sea-worthy\u201d and, citing decisions upon the English Act, which differs materially from the Canadian statute, holds, on that ground, that the defendant is not liable, without determining whether or not there was a latent defect which caused the damage. Mr. Justice Tellier, who dissented, finds that the defendant had established neither its claim to have exercised due diligence nor that the damage resulted from latent defect.\nMr. Justice Greenshields also said:\nIf that bolt, in its bent condition, was a defect which interfered with the navigation of the vessel, it was not a defect apparent to those who examined the steering gear of the vessel. \u201cDue diligence\u201d does not exact the examination of every link making up the steering chain which controls the rudder. The strength of the chain, it is true, is that of its weakest link.\nWith respect, we find it difficult to reconcile this latter view of the learned judge, having regard to the admission that the steering gear is a vital part of a ship\u2019s machinery, with the proof that in determining seaworthiness an adequate inspection of that apparatus is imperative and with the admitted fact that Hamelin knew for at least two months before the bolt broke of the bent condition and should have realized the likelihood of its giving way as it did; indeed we find it difficult to believe that he did not sense this risk, although, perhaps, not as fully appreciative of its gravity as he should have been.\nThere is a mass of testimony not, it is true, uncontradicted, but in our view of great weight and cogency, that the presence of the bend or curve in the bolt afforded a distinct and obvious warning of its weakened condition, which should not have been neglected. We, therefore, find it impossible to assent to the conclusion that the defendant\u2019s employees \u201cexercised due diligence\u201d to make the Hamilton seaworthy. Either their inspection of the steering gear was of such a casual and perfunctory character that they failed to discover the bend or curve, or, having noticed it, they failed to discharge the plain duty of either replacing the defective bolt, or of making it fit for use, if that were possible. That the bolt broke is only what must sooner or later have occurred, and what should have been expected. The power of resistance of the metal having been much reduced was eventually overcome, it may be by having some slight additional stress or strain put upon it. To speak of such a defect as \u201clatent\u201d seems to involve a misuse of that term. We do not find it necessary for the present further to define \u201clatent defect\u201d. \u201cNot discernible by adequate inspection\u201d seems not an inapt paraphrase.\nAn expos\u00e9 in further detail of the voluminous evidence which supports these conclusions would serve no good purpose. To be of any value it would have to be exhaustive and would necessarily be very lengthy.\nAllusion was made in the course of the argument to s. 7 of the statute which relieves vessel owners from liability:\nfor loss arising without their actual fault or privity or without the fault or neglect of their agents, servants or employees. (The word \u201cor\u201d italicised should probably be read as \u201cand.\u201d)\nThe burden of proof under this section is upon the defendant. There would not appear to have been any expert inspection of the ship, on behalf of the owners, prior to leaving Port Colborne, or during the spring of 1924. Captain Legault, master of the Hamilton, had no opportunity to inspect the steering gear before taking command of his ship in 1923. He apparently made no subsequent inspection of it. Hamelin, the ship\u2019s engineer, saw the bent bolt, superficially \u201cexamined\u201d it, and took a chance with it. Dussault, the second officer, or mate, of the Hamilton, gave the following evidence:\nQ. Quand aviez-vous examin\u00e9 l\u2019appareil pour gouverner le vaisseau avant l\u2019accident?\nR. A Port Colborne.\nQ. C\u2019\u00e9tait combien de temps avant l\u2019accident?\nE. Je ne peux pas dire, trois jours \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s, deux jours et demi ou trois jours, je ne peux pas dire.\nQ. Dans quel \u00e9tat l\u2019aviez-vous trouv\u00e9?\nR. Ce n\u2019est pas moi-m\u00eame qui l\u2019ai inspect\u00e9, c\u2019est l\u2019homme de roue, celui qui a l\u2019habitude d\u2019y voir en chargeant. Il a fait le chargement en m\u00eame temps il regarde tout partout, il ne m\u2019a fait aucun rapport.\nQ. Vous ne l\u2019avez pas examin\u00e9 vous-m\u00eame?\nR. Pas \u00e0 Port Colborne. A Port Colborne, j\u2019ai le chargement \u00e0 faire, je m\u2019occupe de charger.\nThe wheelsman, who made no report, was not called as a witness. Did he in fact inspect the steering gear and, if so, what did he find?\nThe weight of the testimony, especially of that given by the practical men called, who spoke from experience in the handling of ships, is in favour of the appellant. The defences afforded by secs. 6 and 7 of the Water Carriage of Goods Act being in derogation of the common law must be clearly made out. The burden of proof was upon the respondent, both as to the \u201cexercise of due diligence, etc.,\u201d and as to the fact alleged by it that the loss or damage was occasioned by \u201ca latent defect in the material of the bolt\u201d and also as to the loss having arisen without its actual fault and without the fault or neglect of its agents, servants or employees. To establish that there was such a latent defect (assuming for the moment the proof of its existence to be sufficient) and that it was a probable cause of the breaking of the bolt does not discharge this burden unless the evidence also excludes other possible causes. Especially is this so where, as here, there is cogent evidence pointing, with at least equal probability (we think with greater), to another cause obviously not latent. It is clear that if any substantial doubt remain, it must, in such a case, be resolved in favour of the appellant. The defendant has failed, in its effort to discharge the burden, which the statute imposes upon it, of establishing that essential element of its defence. As to the other elements its failure has not been less pronounced.\nAfter a careful perusal of the whole record and an analytical study of the evidence, we find ourselves, both as to whether there was proof of an exercise of \u201cdue diligence\u201d and as to whether the cause of the damage was shewn to have been a latent defect, in accord with Mr. Justice Tellier, who succinctly sums up his views in these terms:\nJe ne vois pas comment la d\u00e9fenderesse, dans ces circonstances, pourrait pr\u00e9tendre qu\u2019elle a fait \u201cdue diligence\u201d et que les dommages dont il s\u2019agit sont le r\u00e9sultat d\u2019un \u201cd\u00e9faut latent.\u201d La d\u00e9fenderesse a essay\u00e9 de se justifier. Y a-t-elle r\u00e9ussi? Pas \u00e0 mon avis.\nIt is satisfactory also to find that our conclusions of fact accord with those reached by the learned trial judge, who has had many years experience in deciding such questions and in appreciating the probative force of contradictory evidence.\nWe would, accordingly, allow this appeal with costs here and in the Court of King\u2019s Bench and would restore the judgment of the Superior Court.\nNewcombe J.\u2014It is, in my view, sufficient for the disposition of this appeal to uphold the finding at the trial that the owner failed in the exercise of due diligence\nto make the ship in all respects seaworthy and properly * * * equipped.\nI do not think we can justifiably reverse that finding, and the respondent company does not, therefore, bring itself within the relief of the statute.\nI concur in the result.\nSmith J.\u2014The burden of establishing that the bolt of the turnbuckle broke by reason of latent defect was, as pointed out in the reasons of the Chief Justice, upon the respondent. There was contradictory evidence upon this point, and a finding by the learned trial judge against the respondent, which finding, as the Chief Justice holds, should not be interfered with.\nI just wish to say that, in my opinion, the evidence of latent defect offered by the respondent does not go far enough in itself to establish that this defect was the cause of the breaking of the bolt. Neither do I think that the evidence offered by the appellant establishes that the breaking was caused by the weakness in the bolt brought about by the slight bend. The maximum strain on this bolt in operating the rudder was, according to the evidence, 3\u00b74 tons. The tensile strength of the rudder chains and this bolt was 20 tons, assuming that the iron of the bolt was of the ordinary quality in such iron. The safety margin was therefore about six. The respondent\u2019s witnesses did not expressly say that the defect that they referred to in the quality of the iron would reduce its tensile strength from 20 tons to 3\u00b74 tons, nor did the witnesses for the appellant say that the bend would make that difference in the tensile strength of the bolt. They talk about the weakening effect, particularly on the outer side of the bend. It is clear that the greatest amount of weakening by reason of the bend would be at the point of maximum bend. The bolt did not break at that point, but at a point where there was no bend or, at least, practically none. One witness assumes that the bending process caused a crack to commence at the point where the break subsequently occurred. There is no evidence that any such crack was produced, and his evidence is mere theorizing as to what may have happened.\nIn my opinion the breakage occurred by reason of the conditions that originally brought about the bend, and that the mere existence of the bend in the bolt observed by the engineer was an indication that ought to have brought to nis mind that some condition existed that ought not to exist, and which indicated danger. The evidence suggests two conditions, either one of which may have resulted in the bending of the bolt. One is that, with the turnbuckle screwed out to about its full extension, the \u201cU\u201d end of the bolt in question would project slightly beyond the outer point of the quadrant, so that the strain on this \u201cU\u201d, instead of being in the direction of the axis of the bolt, would be at right angles or nearly at right angles to that axis, thus constituting the end of the quadrant a fulcrum on which the bolt would act as a lever, which would have a bending effect on the bolt and, of course, would subject it to a strain in a direction that it was not designed to take. If that condition existed, it would be evident to an intelligent engineer that it was a dangerous condition.\nThe other suggestion is that the bolt in operation came into collision with the iron housing, and there is evidence from which it might fairly be inferred that this condition at the time of the accident actually prevailed. The strain on the bolt, as I have said, was designed to be parallel to its axis, and if it had been subjected to that strain alone, it would have been impossible for the bolt to have taken a bend. On the contrary, the strain would have a tendency to straighten a bent bolt, rather than to bend a straight one. The engineer says that he did not put a new bolt in because he thought it would take the same bend. He is not asked, and he does not undertake to explain why he thought that a bolt which, working as the apparatus was designed to work, with a strain only in the direction of its axis, would tend to take a set or bend. If he really thought so, it must have been because he was aware of some condition existing that would have a tendency to make the bolt bend. As I have said, if such a condition did exist, it was a dangerous condition that he should have remedied.\nI agree with the Chief Justice.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: E. Languedoc.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Casgrain, McDougall & Demers.\n[1] (1929) Q.R. 46 K.B. 305.\n",

Pratt (Plaintiff par reprise d\u2019instance) Appellant:\nand\nEdgar Beaman (Defendant) Respondent.\n1929: October 21.\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Newcombe, Rinfret and Smith JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING\u2019S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nNegligence\u2014Accident\u2014Damages\u2014Loss of wages\u2014Death of victim before trial\u2014Taken into account in estimating damages\u2014Arts. 1053, 1054, 1055 C.C.\nIn an action for damages for loss of wages resulting from an accident, events which happened between the date of the accident, such as the death of the victim. and the time of the trial must be taken into account in estimating such damages. The principle held by this court in Findlay v. Howard (58 Can. S.C.R. 516) is equally applicable whether the claim for damages is in tort, under articles 1053, 1054 and 1055 C.C., or is a claim for breach of contract.\nLemelin v. Ladrie (Q.R. 59 S.C. 456) discussed, and held to be an authority against allowing in an action commenced before the death of the victim any damages occasioned by such death.\nJudgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Q.R. 46 K.B. 401) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench appeal side, province of Quebec[1], reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, Weir J. (1), and reducing the amount awarded to the appellant from $7,500 to $2,075.\nAn action in damages was instituted by one Frank Pratt against the respondent to recover damages resulting from a collision between respondent\u2019s motor car and a taxicab in which Pratt was a passenger. The trial took place in March, 1927; and judgment was rendered on the 1st of April, 1927, for $7,500, the full amount claimed and the costs. Frank Pratt died on the 23rd of May, 1927. The respondent had already appealed from the above judgment on the ground that the trial judge had refused to permit, either in cross-examination of appellant\u2019s medical witnesses or in examination-in-chief of the same witnesses who had been summoned as respondent\u2019s own witnesses, counsel for respondent to attempt to make evidence as to the probable number of years which these experts considered Pratt would live in order that the court might have before it some evidence to justify it in awarding an amount for future loss of wages and earnings commensurate with the probable expectancy of life of Pratt. The appeal was maintained and the record was sent back to the Superior Court in order to allow the respondent to make such evidence. The trial was therefore resumed before the same judge, Weir J., and judgment was rendered for the same amount, i.e., $7,500. The respondent again appealed from this judgment. The Appellate Court reversed it and reduced the amount of damages awarded; and, amongst the consid\u00e9rants of that judgment are the following:\n\u201cConsidering that the Superior Court has based its estimate of $6,000 for loss of earnings of Pratt upon the assumption that he would live and continue to earn wages for sixteen and a half years from the time of the accident, ignoring as irrelevant the fact, proven by the respondent herself (now appellant), that Pratt had died before the trial of the case was completed;\n\u201cConsidering that, in estimating the damages claimed by the respondent (plaintiff par reprise d\u2019instance now appellant) for loss of wages which the original plaintiff, Pratt, was prevented by his injuries from earning, the court must take into consideration not only relevant facts and circumstances existing before and at the time the action was instituted but also facts affecting the amount of such wages that occurred between that time and the trial of the case;\n\u201cConsidering that the death of Pratt materially affected the amount of earnings lost by him by making definite what before had been uncertain namely, the length of time during which he was totally incapacitated by reason of the accident;\n\u201cConsidering that Pratt lived approximately one year and nine months after the accident and so lost wages which he otherwise would probably have earned during that period amounting to * * *.\nW. K. McKeown K.C. for the appellant.\nEug. Lafleur K.C. and W. A. Merrill K.C. for the respondent.\nAt the conclusion of the argument of counsel for the appellant and without calling on counsel for the respondent, the judgment of the court was delivered orally by\nAnglin C.J.C.\u2014Three distinct grounds of appeal have been pressed upon us. As to the first ground taken, the decision of this Court in Finlay v. Howard[2], is conclusive against the appellant. The principle of that decision is equally applicable whether the claim for damages is in tort, under articles 1053, 1054, 1055 C.C., or is a claim for breach of contract.\nThe case of Lemelin v. Ladrie et Poulin[3], cited by counsel for the appellant, far from being helpful to him, is a distinct authority against allowing in this action, commenced before the death of the victim, any damages occasioned by his death. Assuming that it could be shown that the death was caused by fault of the defendant and that an action for damages occasioned thereby was brought within a year, the present plaintiff might therein have a claim under article 1056 C.C., but that would be an \u201cindependent\u201d action and could not be added by incidental demand to the present claim. The case cited is an authority for her right to continue, by revivor, the action already brought by her deceased husband.\nThe second ground of appeal is that the damages allowed for pain and suffering by the trial judge, $1,500, should not have been reduced, as they were on appeal, to $500. While, if we were the first appellate court, we might have been disposed not to interfere with the assessment of these damages by the Superior Court, it is the well established practice of this court not to interfere with an amount allowed for damages, such as these, by the court of last resort in a province. That court is, as a general rule, in a much better position than we can be to determine a proper allowance having regard to local environment. It is, of course, impossible to say that the Court of King\u2019s Bench erred in principle in reducing these damages.\nThe third ground of appeal is that the courts below, in dealing with the question of interest on compensation, appear to have followed the ordinary practice of not allowing interest on unliquidated damages prior to the ascertainment of their amount. We see nothing in this case to justify any departure from that wholesome practice.\nIt follows that the appeal fails and must be dismissed (Mr. Lafleur, do you ask for costs under the circumstances? Mr. Lafleur: Yes, we do.) with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W. K. McKeown.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Duff & Merrill.\n[1] (1929) Q.R. 46 K.B. 401.\n[2] (1919) 58 Can. S.C.R. 516.\n[3] (1921) Q.R. 59 S.C. 456.\n",

Can. Nat. Rys. v. C.P.R. Co. ([1929] S.C.R. 135). The Board did not misdirect itself by holding that it had jurisdiction to look at and use, as a basis for fixing the rates between Armstrong at the head of the lakes and Quebec City, the Crow\u2019s Nest Agreement from Calgary to Fort William and an agreement of July 29, 1903. Subsection 5 of section 325 of the Railway Act declares the powers of the Board under the Act to fix and determine just and reasonable rates shall not be limited or in any manner affected by the provisions of any Act of the Parliament of Canada, or by any agreement made or entered into pursuant thereto, save and except as to rates on grain and flour from points west of Fort William to Fort William and Port Arthur. The wording of this subsection should not be construed as a restriction upon the powers of the Board to fix the rates set out in the Order now in question. On the contrary it seems from the language used that Parliament contemplated that the Board would look at and consider the statutes and agreements relating to rates which had been in force or agreed upon, and desired to make it clear that, with the exception of the Crow\u2019s Nest Agreement, the Board was not to be bound by any such statute and agreement. What weight these statutes and agreements shall have is left to the discretion of the Board; and, subject to certain conditions, the obligation rests upon the Board of fixing rates which are \u201cfair and reasonable.\u201d In this case, the own conduct of the Canadian National Railways since the Order in question was made has been such as to justify the inference that, in their judgment, the rates were not unfair or unreasonable.\nAPPLICATION for an Order extending the time for applying for leave to appeal, and for leave to appeal to this court under section 52 (2) of the Railway Act from an Order of the Board of Railway Commissioners No. 448, dated 26th August, 1927, regarding the subject of railway freight rates in Canada.\nAlistair Fraser K.C., A.

Co.\nLamont J.\u2014This is an application on behalf of the Canadian National Railways for an order extending the time for applying for leave to appeal, and for leave to appeal to this Court from the Order of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada, known as \u201cGeneral Order No. 448.\u201d The ground upon which the application is based is that the Board exceeded its jurisdiction in making the Order in that it proceeded upon a wrong principle by taking into consideration in fixing the rate: (1) The agreement of July 29, 1903, made between the Government of Canada and the Grand Trunk Railway Company, scheduled in the Dominion Statutes of that year, in the Confirmatory Act, and (2) The Crow\u2019s Nest rate from Calgary to Fort William.\nThe application was opposed by (inter alia) the city of Quebec, the Quebec Harbour Commissioners, the province of Nova Scotia, the city of Halifax and the Halifax Harbour Commissioners.\nThe opposition to the application was based on two grounds,\n(1) That the application was not made within one month from the making of the Order as required by s. 52, ss. 2, of the Railway Act, and that no special curcumstances had been shewn which would justify the granting of an extension of time within which to apply for leave to appeal, and\n(2) That in view of the action of the Canadian National Railways in putting into force and continuing for two years the rates fixed by the Order, it was not now fairly arguable that the rates fixed therein were unfair or unreasonable.\nSection 52, subsecs. 2 and 3 of the Railway Act provide for an appeal from the Board to the Supreme Court of Canada (1) Upon a question of jurisdiction, if leave therefor is obtained from a judge of that court, and (2) Upon a question of law or jurisdiction or both, if leave therefor is obtained from the Board. The leave in either case is to be obtained within one month after the making of the Order sought to be appealed from, or, within such further time as the judge, under subsec. 2, or the Board, under subsec. 3, under special circumstances, shall allow.\nThe Order in respect of which leave to appeal is sought was made on August 26, 1927. No application to a judge of this Court for leave to appeal was made within a month of the date of the Order, nor, in fact, until September of this year, two years after the Order was made. It is, therefore, necessary for the Canadian National Railways to obtain an Order extending the time for applying for leave to appeal. This can only be granted by a judge \u201cunder special circumstances.\u201d\nThe special circumstances alleged to exist are as follows:\n(1) That the railways had within the proper time applied to the Board for an extension of the time within which they could apply to the Board for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada; that the Board had granted the application and had subsequently renewed the extension given from time to time until June, 1929, when an application was made to the Board for leave to appeal, but the same was refused.\n(2) That the Canadian National Railways had, in May of this year, received a notice from the Board calling upon them to shew cause why an Order should not be made directing a reduction of the rates fixed by General Order No. 448, in conformity with the principles laid down in that order.\n(3) That applications were now being made to the Board to fix a rate to Halifax and St. John based upon the rates fixed by the Order from Armstrong to Quebec.\nOn the argument before me counsel for the Canadian National Railways very frankly stated that had no steps been taken to bring about a further reduction of the rates fixed in the Order sought to be appealed from and no application had been made to have rates fixed to Maritime ports based upon those fixed to Quebec, the Canadian National Railways would have been content not to seek leave to appeal as there was not a great deal of grain being transported to Quebec, and they did not consider that the rates fixed would injure them very much.\nIn my opinion the action of the Canadian National Railways in obtaining from the Board extensions of time covering a period of nearly two years within which to make application for leave to appeal, and then appealing for such leave only when a reduction of the rates fixed by the Order was threatened and an application had been made to obtain a rate to Maritime ports based on those rates, points strongly to the conclusion that the Canadian National Railways had no bona fide intention of appealing against the Order on account of any rates fixed therein. What the Canadian National Railways were seeking to accomplish, by getting numerous extensions of time within which they might apply for leave to appeal, was to hold the threat of an appeal over the heads of those who might contemplate applying to the Board to fix a rate to Maritime ports based upon the rates to Quebec. Under these circumstances I am unable to hold that the obtaining of the extensions to which I have referred, or the applications now being made to the Board, can be considered a special circumstance within the meaning of s. 52, ss. 2.\nOn the main ground upon which the application was based the Canadian National Railways, in my opinion, cannot succeed. As my brother Duff pointed out in Canadian National Railways v. Canadian Pacific Railway Company[1], it is the duty of a judge on an application for leave to appeal to consider whether the question which the applicants desire to raise is one in respect of which there can be said to be a fairly arguable controversy.\nThe Canadian National Railways desire to appeal from the Order fixing the rates from Armstrong to Quebec city. Their contention is that the Board misdirected itself by holding that it had jurisdiction to look at and use, as a basis for fixing the rates, the Crow\u2019s Nest agreement from Calgary to Fort William, and the agreement of July 29, 1903; and s. 325, ss. 5 of the Railway Act was cited in support thereof. That section declares that the powers of the Board under the Act to fix and determine just and reasonable rates shall not be limited or in any manner affected by the provisions of any Act of the Parliament of Canada, or by any agreement made or entered into pursuant thereto, save and except as to rates on grain and flour from points west of Fort William to Fort William and Port Arthur. The wording of this subsection, on any fair reading of it, is not capable, in my opinion, of being construed as a restriction upon the powers of the Board to fix the rates set out in the Order. On the contrary it seems to me from the language used that Parliament contemplated that the Board would look at and consider the statutes and agreements relating to rates which had been in force or agreed upon, and desired to make it clear that, with the exception of the Crow\u2019s Nest agreement, the Board was not to be bound by any such statute or agreement. The Board was, therefore, entitled to take into consideration the agreements to which objection was taken. Taking them into consideration, however, does not mean, as I indicated above, that the Board is under any obligation to adopt the rates fixed or agreed to therein. What weight they shall have is, in my opinion, left to the discretion of the Board subject to this, that after it has given full consideration to these agreements as well as to the other matter to which reference was made so often on the argument, namely, the expenditure of three hundred and thirty million dollars by the Parliament of Canada in constructing or aiding the lines now forming the Canadian National Railways, and the desire of the Government, as expressed in the Order in Council, to encourage the movement of traffic through Canadian ports, the obligation still rests upon the Board of fixing rates which are \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d from the standpoint not only of the producer but also from the point of view of the Railways.\nHas it been made to appear on this application that it is fairly arguable that the rates fixed by Order No. 448 are unfair or unreasonable? I am very clearly of opinion that it has not. Not only have the Canadian National Railways failed to shew that the Board misdirected itself, but their own conduct since the Order was made has been such as to justify the inference that, in their judgment, the rates were not unfair or unreasonable.\nThe application will be dismissed with costs.\nApplication refused with costs.\n[1] [1929] Can.

Maddison (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1929: October 1, 2; 1929: November 4\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Newcombe, Lamont and Smith JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nContract\u2014Breach\u2014Sale of goods\u2014Pleading\u2014Breach of duty to employer\u2014Evidence of plaintiff's contract of hiring with employer\u2014Admissibility\u2014Fraud.\nIn an action for breach of a written contract the defence was raised that the respondent was guilty of a breach of duty towards his employer in entering into the contract, but as no fraud was alleged in this regard, the paragraph was struck out with leave to amend. The amend- ed paragraph alleged that the contract was made by the appellant's agent without authority and contrary to instructions and that the agent and the respondent fraudulently conspired together to bring about the contract, that the contract was procured by fraud and the respondent fraudulently obtained from the agent a price lower than the market price of the goods. The trial judge refused to admit evidence of the respondent's contract of hiring with his employer on the ground that a defence of illegal contract had not been raised on the pleadings; and the jury found in favour of the respondent. It was argued by the appellant before this court that the price named in the contract being less than the market price, a profit would have accrued to the respondent if the contract had been carried out and that such concession to the respondent had been given by the appellant's agent, and accepted by the respondent, as a bribe to induce him to advance the interests of the appellant in the dealings of the respondent's employer with it through the respondent; and it was further argued by the appellant that the facts already disclosed by the evidence point to the existence of such a conspiracy or illegal agreement and that, notwithstanding the insufficiency of the pleadings, it was the duty of the trial judge to investigate the facts and for that purpose to receive further evidence supporting the appellant's argument above stated.\nHeld that the trial judge was right in rejecting the evidence offered by the appellant. If such an agreement, affecting the contract sued upon, had been embodied in a document put in evidence by the respondent, and the character of it had been thereby plainly disclosed, or if the nature of it plainly appeared from other evidence adduced by the respondent, then, if the court was satisfied it has before it all the facts, the respondent would have necessarily failed; and, in such circumstances, it was immaterial whether or not the agreement had been pleaded in defence. It is otherwise, however, where the appellant, in order to shew that the contract sued upon was unenforceable, was obliged to adduce evidence of the corrupt inducement. The appellant was not entitled to present such evidence unless the respondent has had notice, through the pleadings, of the nature of the defence. North Western Salt Co. v. Electrolytic Alkali Co. ([1914] A.C. 461) followed.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal (40 B.C. Rep. 499) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], affirming the judgment of the trial judge, Macdonald J., with a jury and maintaining the respondent's action, awarding damages for breach of a contract for the sale of goods.\nBy contract in writing of the 2nd of September, 1926, the respondent purchased from the appellant 1,000 cases (55 pounds each) of Manchurian shelled walnuts at 24 cents per pound, shipment to be made from the Orient in December, 1926, to be delivered in Vancouver. The ap- pellant failed to deliver the goods and the respondent claimed $5,500 being the difference between the contract price of 24 cents per pound and 34 cents per pound the market price at the time of the breach. At the time the contract was made, the respondent was manager of the wholesale grocery department of the Hudson's Bay Company in Vancouver, his duties including the purchase of walnuts for his employer and one Mason was the appellant's agent in Vancouver with whom the respondent made the contract in question. The appellant alleged that the respondent and Mason in breach of their respective duties fraudulently conspired together to enter into the contract for the sale of walnuts at a price less than the market price at which the appellant was selling walnuts to their other customers.\nGlyn Osler K.C. for the appellant.\nW. F. Chipman K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDUFF J.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia[2], pronounced on the 8th of January, 1929, dismissing an appeal from the judgment of Mr. Justice W. A. McDonald, awarding the respondent $4,000 damages for breach of a contract for the sale and delivery to him by the appellant company, of 1,000 cases of Manchurian shelled walnuts. The issues raised by the pleadings were submitted to the jury by the learned trial judge, in a charge which the majority of the Court of Appeal, with whose view we agree, held to be free from objection, and these issues, by the general verdict of the jury, were disposed of in plaintiff's favour.\nAt the trial evidence was offered in support of a defence which in its most advantageous form, and substantially as put by Mr. Osler, may be stated thus: The respondent was the manager of the wholesale grocery department of the Hudson's Bay Company at Vancouver. As such, he acted for his employers in their dealings with the appellant company, in the purchase, that is to say, of various kinds of commodities, including shelled Manchurian walnuts. The price named in the contract sued upon, it is said, was considerably less than the market price, and by reason of this, a profit of several hundred dollars would have accrued to the respondent if the contract had been carried out; and this concession to the respondent was, it is alleged, given by the agents of the appellant company, and accepted by the respondent, as a bribe to induce him to advance the interests of the appellant company in the dealings of the Hudson's Bay Company with them through the respondent. These allegations, if established, would no doubt have constituted a defence (Harrington v. The Victoria Graving Dock Co.[3]; but the learned trial judge rejected the evidence offered in support of them on the ground that the defence had not been pleaded.\nIt is quite clear that no such defence is set up in the pleadings; but it was argued by Mr. Osler, on behalf of the appellant company, that the facts disclosed by the evidence point to the existence of such a conspiracy, and that, notwithstanding the state of the pleadings, it was the duty of the learned trial judge to investigate the facts, and for that purpose, to receive the evidence tendered.\nThe pertinent rule is not open to doubt. If such an agreement, affecting the contract sued upon, is embodied in a document put in evidence by the plaintiff, and the character of it is thereby plainly disclosed, or if the nature of it plainly appears from other evidence adduced by the plaintiff, then if the Court is satisfied it has before it all the facts, the plaintiff must necessarily fail; and, in such circumstances, it is immaterial whether or not the agreement has been pleaded in defence. It is otherwise, however, where the defendant, in order to shew that the contract sued upon is unenforceable, must adduce evidence of the corrupt inducement. The defendant is not entitled to present such evidence unless the plaintiff has had notice, through the pleadings, of the nature of the defence. Lord Moulton said, in North Western Salt Co. v. Electrolytic Alkali Co.[4]:\nAt the trial before Scruton J. the plaintiffs put their manager into the witness box to give evidence on some issue of fact raised in the pleadings. In commencing his cross-examination of this witness counsel for the defendants put a question to him admittedly not relevant to any matter pleaded, but directed solely to shew that the contract was, in fact, a contract in restraint of trade, and thus void or unenforceable. Objection was taken to the question on the ground that if the defendants intended to raise such a defence they ought to have pleaded it. The objection was sustained by the judge. He could scarcely have done otherwise in face of the specific provision in the Rules that the defendant must raise by his pleading all matters which shew the action or counter-claim not to be maintainable, or that the transaction is either void or voidable in point of law, and all such grounds of defence as, if not raised, would be likely to take the opposite party by surprise, as, for instance, fraud, facts shewing illegality either by common or statute law. The defendants there upon asked leave to amend their pleading so as to raise the defence of illegality, but the judge refused such leave, on the ground that it would be unfair to the plaintiffs to allow such an amendment to be made when the trial had already commenced.\nThe reasonableness of this refusal is not now in question. No appeal was brought against it, and the defendants have at no stage of the case renewed their application. It is evident, and, indeed, it is not denied, that the point was before the minds of their counsel from the first, and that it was not by inadvertence, but by choice, that it was not pleaded originally, or that leave to add such a plea was not applied for during the period of more than eighteen months that elapsed between the delivery of the points of defence and the trial.\nIn the result the judge found in favour of the plaintiffs for \u00a31,055 4s. 10d. damages. The defendants appealed, and on the hearing of the appeal their counsel raised the contention that the contract sued on, when considered with the facts of the case as shewn by the evidence, was in restraint of trade, and was a contract having for its purpose and effect the maintenance of an illegal monopoly injurious to the public; that the Court was entitled, and, indeed, bound, to take cognizance of this contention; and that accordingly it ought to allow the appeal and dismiss the action, regardless of the fact that the issue of illegality was not raised in the pleadings. The Court of Appeal by a majority accepted this view of the case, and allowed the appeal on that ground. Questions as to the proper measure and amount of damages, therefore, became irrelevant, and the Court of Appeal has neither considered nor pronounced upon these matters.\nThe present appeal is from this decision of the Court of Appeal, and the discussion before this House has related solely to the question whether the Court was justified in dismissing the action on the ground that the contract was illegal and unenforceable. The argument on behalf of the defendants is a very specious one. It is conceded that if a written contract is ex facie in restraint of trade so as to be against public policy, the judge is entitled, and, indeed, bound, to take the point, and the decision is for him, and not for the jury. The same must be true when the question is whether a contract, when taken in connection with the surrounding circumstances, is in like manner against public policy. This must be so because the question is one of law, and therefore is for the Court and not for the jury; although it is needless to say that if there be a dispute as to the facts, that dispute has to be settled by the tribunal which has the duty of deciding as to fact before the judge can exercise his function. If, therefore, say the defendants, the Court, taking the contract in connection with the facts appearing in the plaintiff's case or otherwise legitim- ately brought before the Court at the trial, comes to the conclusion that is against public policy, it is entitled and bound to dismiss the action.\nThis reasoning would be sound in the case of a properly constituted action, where the defence of illegality is duly raised on the pleadings. The Court would then be entitled to assume that it had before it, in evidence, all the relevant surrounding circumstances. If any be missing it is the plaintiff's own fault, and he must take the consequences. In such a case the legal motto, de non apparentibus et de non existentibus eadem est ratio, is rightly applied. But it is not so where the issue is not raised on the pleadings. The plaintiffs have received no notice that the point will be raised, and are presumably not prepared with the necessary evidence. Even if they are in a position to call the evidence, they are not at liberty to do so, because they are only entitled to call evidence on the issues raised by the pleadings. The facts before the Court at the end of the case are therefore only casual selection from the surrounding circumstances, and the Court has no longer the right to treat them as properly and fully representing those surrounding circumstances so as to justify its pronouncing on their true effect upon the contract. It may be shortly put as follows: if the contract and its setting be fully before the Court it must pronounce on the legality of the transaction. But it may not do so if the contract be not ex facie illegal, and it has before it only a part of the setting, which it is not entitled to take, as against the plaintiffs, as fairly representing the whole setting.\nLurking beneath the argument for the defendants was the idea that the public good is a matter of such supreme importance that the Courts should not require proof in due form and in accordance with the recognized requirements of our legal procedure of any charge of illegality or offence against the rules of public policy. But our judicial procedure is based on the principle that in fairness a litigant should have due notice of the issues that are to be raised in order that he may prepare himself with the evidence necessary to present his case fittingly to the Court, and it would indeed be strange to hold that this wholesome rule should be relaxed when he is charged with something so grave as acting against the common weal. Such a proposition partakes of the absurdity of the rule in criminal proceedings that prevailed in England centuries ago, namely, that, because felony was so very wicked, persons accused of it should not be allowed the assistance of counsel. Happily we have shaken ourselves free from all such notions, and the principle that in all cases fair notice should be given to the plaintiff of all the defences that are to be raised is now so fully recognized in our procedure that it is formulated in the rule above quoted, in language which permits no misunderstanding as to the general rule, and which, in particular, specifically includes such a case as the present.\nWith these observations of Lord Moulton, Lord Haldane and Lord Parker in substance agree. They apply to the present case.\nNor, in view of the course of the litigation, is it possible to give the appellant company a further opportunity of establishing this defence. For the purpose of raising it, the appellant company was given an opportunity, by order of the Court of Appeal, of amending its defence (Maddi- son v. Bain (1)), but deliberately elected to proceed to trial without doing so. At the trial, the trial judge having ruled that, on the state of the pleadings, the defence was not open, no application was made for leave to amend, nor does the appellant company appear to have asked for such leave in the Court of Appeal. Such being the history of the proceedings, the appeal and the litigation must now be determined upon the pleadings as they stand.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: St. John, Dixon & Turner.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Knox Walkem.\n[1] (1929) 40 B.C.

The proposed appeal is from a judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, confirming the decision by the Superior Court, refusing a writ of prohibition to the Court of Sessions of the Peace. The appellant had been convicted by that court of practising medicine illegally and contrary to c. 213, R.S.Q., 1925. For this offence he had been condemned to pay a fine of $50, or, in default, to suffer sixty days imprisonment. By the present action, it was sought to prevent the enforcement of this punishment.\nP. Dubois for the motion.\nP. St. Germain K.C. contra.\nAnglin C.J.C.\u2014The proviso to s. 41, notwithstanding the wide terms in which it is couched, is necessarily restricted in its application to cases within s. 41 itself, i.e., to cases in which the appellate court had jurisdiction, if so advised, to grant special leave to appeal to this court under s. 41.\nThe proviso is based upon a refusal of such leave by the appellate court. It therefore presupposes the right or power in that court to grant such leave and that it has refused to exercise that right or power. But, under the terms of s. 41, such power only exists in cases within s. 36, and the granting or refusal of prohibition in a criminal case is expressly excluded from our jurisdiction by that section, which defines the subjects of appeal to this court. This court is purely statutory in its origin and in its jurisdiction. There would be no object, therefore, in extending the time to enable the appellant to apply for special leave to appeal under the proviso to s. 41 since that leave must necessarily be refused for want of jurisdiction to grant it.\nApplication dismissed.\n",

In this case, upon an action previously brought, a final judgment between the same parties had annulled two deeds for the reason that the annuity thereby provided should have been $2,000, instead of $800. Although the dispositif of the judgment stated that the action was maintained \u201cso far as the annulment of the deeds was prayed for,\u201d that involved a determination of the true amount of the annuity as being $2,000, which was the same question as that sought to be controverted in the present case; and such question was concluded as between the parties by the judgment in the first case.\nWhere sums pertaining to the administration by one party of the business and affairs of the other party have, through the course of dealing between the two, become bound up with items of debit or credit derived from other sources, such as annuities, salary, farm produces, etc., so that, during the period of administration, charges offset ad- vances or payments of money and so on: it is not open to either of the parties to sue on a single transaction or for a specific sum of money. The recourse is by action to account. The account must be discussed as a whole, a balance must be struck and such balance alone may be awarded to the party entitled to receive it.\nArt. 1536 C.C. which provides that \u201cthe seller of an immoveable cannot demand the dissolution of the sale by reason of the failure of the buyer to pay the price, unless there is a special stipulation to that effect\u201d applies in the case of a promise of sale accompanied by tradition and actual possession (Art. 1478 C.C.)\nAPPEAL and cross-appeal from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, varying the judgment of the Superior Court, Martineau J., (who had awarded the respondent the sum of $12,400), and maintaining the respondent\u2019s action for $10,000, for annuities.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nJ. W. Ste-Marie K.C. for the appellant.\nH. Aylen K.C. and J. A. Aylen for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014The appeal is from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (appeal side) of the province of Quebec modifying the judgment of the Superior Court sitting in the district of Hull from which both parties had appealed to the Court of King\u2019s Bench. The respondent has also given notice of cross-appeal to this court.\nThe respondent is the widow of the late Joshua Ellard, in his lifetime merchant of the township of Wright, who died on March 24, 1916. Under the last will and testament of her husband, she was made his universal and residuary legatee. After his death she continued to carry on his business as a general merchant and is still carrying it on.\nThe appellant is the son of the respondent and of the late Joshua Ellard. Before the death of his father, he was already managing the business and continued so to do until the month of March, 1919, when he requested his mother to accept his resignation. Matters however got to be unsatisfactory and the appellant was induced to assume once more the management of his mother\u2019s interests. The agreement arrived at was reduced to writing at Gracefield on July 4, 1919.\nIt begins by stating that the respondent\nrequires the assistance, advice and services of the said Herbert Millar Ellard in the administration of the said estate * * * and also in the administration of her personal affairs\nand Herbert Ellard agrees to give them on the following terms: (1) He is to have \u201cfull control, care and management of the property, business and affairs\u201d of Mrs. Ellard during her lifetime; (2) he is to have a power of attorney, irrevocable for five years, but subject to renewal at his own option, with \u201cthe most ample powers\u201d; (3) Mrs. Ellard agrees to pay him $100 per month as salary for his services; (4) Mrs. Ellard agrees to convey to Herbert Ellard, on or before the 1st October, 1919, the properties known as the Victoria and Pickanock farms, save and except certain pieces of land therein described and also save and except the homestead with two acres of land adjoining, the store, hotel and mill properties\ntogether with such areas of land in connection with each of the said properties as will best serve the requirements of each of the said properties from the point of view of ultimate sale, rental, or other disposal thereof\nand Herbert Ellard is to cause a proper survey to be made thereof. (5) Then comes paragraph 6 of the agreement which should be recited verbatim, as it affords the main ground for this litigation:\n6. In consideration of the agreement by the said Ellen Millar to convey to the said Herbert Millar Ellard the properties hereinabove mentioned, the said Herbert Millar Ellard agrees to pay to the said Ellen Millar, during her lifetime, an annuity of $2,000, whereof $800 per annum shall constitute a first charge upon the aforesaid properties and $1,200 thereof to constitute a first charge upon trading and other operations hereby placed under the control, care and management of the said Herbert Ellard, it being understood that all profits derived from the said trading or other operations, in excess of the $1,200 will belong absolutely to the said Ellen Millar.\n(6) Herbert Ellard agrees to render annually, on the first day of August, a statement, duly audited and certified by a chartered accountant, of his management of Mrs. El-lard\u2019s affairs.\n(7) Finally, it is stated that the agreement cancels a donation made by Mrs. Ellard to Herbert Ellard in 1917.\nIn order to carry out this agreement, so far as concerned the demarcation of the properties conveyed, the appellant caused a deed to be prepared, which the respondent signed on the 23rd June, 1920; but, as the lots in the said deed were not described by their official cadastral numbers, a further deed to cover this insufficiency in the description was signed by the respondent on the 14th March, 1921.\nIn both of these deeds the consideration provided for in the agreement of 4th July, 1919, was fixed at an annuity of $800.\nOn the 27th September, 1923, the respondent revoked the power of attorney she had given to the appellant.\nOn the 22nd January, 1924, the respondent brought an action against the appellant praying that the agreement of 4th July, 1919, and the deeds of 23rd June, 1920, and 14th March, 1921, be set aside on the ground of fraud in securing the same.\nThe Superior Court maintained the action in toto, but the Court of King\u2019s Bench found that\nledit acte du 4 juillet 1919 n\u2019est annulable pour aucune des causes ou raisons invoqu\u00e9es par la demanderesse; que cette derni\u00e8re ne montre pas qu\u2019elle a valable raison de s\u2019en plaindre; et qu\u2019il s\u2019en suit que, quant \u00e0 cet acte-l\u00e0, sa demande aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e.\nThe agreement made in Gracefield on the 4th July, 1919, was therefore upheld by the appellate court. A further appeal to this court by Mrs. Ellard against the validity of the agreement proved unsuccessful.\nWith respect to the two deeds however, the judgment of the Superior Court was confirmed by the Court of King\u2019s Bench and the decision of that court was not appealed from.\nThe result was that Herbert Ellard still required a deed from his mother to obtain proper conveyance of the properties mentioned in the Gracefield agreement. On the other hand, he had yet to account for the management of his mother\u2019s property, business and affairs. (See judgment of this court in the first case between the same parties)[1].\nThe parties unfortunately were unable to come to an understanding and Mrs. Ellard brought this second action asking that, unless Herbert Ellard accepted the descriptions set out in a deed, which she tendered and which she declared her readiness to sign, the respective parts of the lots which she was entitled to retain and the parts her son was entitled to receive be defined by the court. The action also claimed $15,500 for annuities then due as the consideration of the conveyance and asked that, in case Herbert Ellard failed to pay this or such other sums as may be awarded, the agreement of 4th July, 1919, be set aside and Mrs. Ellard be relieved from all obligation to convey; and that, in that case, Herbert Ellard be ordered to deliver to Mrs. Ellard the properties of which he had taken possession and to pay $15,500 for the enjoyment thereof as well as for the value of pulpwood by him cut and removed therefrom.\nHerbert Ellard pleaded in substance that on the 18th October, 1919, in accordance with the Gracefield agreement, he had caused a survey to be made of the parcels or tracts of land Mrs. Ellard had agreed to convey to him. A description of the lots in conformity with the survey was inserted in the deeds of 23rd June, 1920, and 14th March, 1921, but these had been set aside by the courts, for reasons having nothing to do with the survey itself. He thought this survey correctly defined the lots and was always willing to sign a deed accordingly, but Mrs. Ellard refused to accept it. He was still ready to do so, but would not sign the deed tendered by Mrs. Ellard, because the description of the lots widely departed from the agreement. Herbert Ellard further pleaded that until he secured a proper deed from Mrs. Ellard, he could not be called upon to pay her the annuities which, at all events, since she had revoked his power of attorney in September, 1923, amounted only to $800 and not to $2,000 per year; that immediately after the revocation of the power of attorney he had paid Mrs. Ellard $1,733.35, in full of all that was then due to her and she had accepted the amount; that from then on, he had regularly tendered to her payments on the basis of $800 a year, which she had refused. He denied Mrs. Ellard\u2019s right in any event to the cancellation of the agreement of the 4th July, 1919, because of the absence in it of any resolutory clause.\nThe trial judge found that Mrs. Ellard was not entitled to the parcels of land claimed by her, and he proceeded to\nfix and determine * * * the parts of said lots that (she) was entitled to receive and the parts thereof that (Herbert Ellard) was entitled to retain under the agreement. He also found that the true amount of the annuity was $2,000, to be paid to Mrs. Ellard during her lifetime, and not $800 as was contended by Herbert Ellard. He accordingly gave judgment on that basis for seven annual payments, less however a sum of $1,600 which he held to have been paid by the son in the interval. He dismissed all the subsidiary conclusions of the action. A deed embodying these findings was drafted by the judge himself and annexed to his judgment as representing the conveyance which Mrs. Ellard ought to sign.\nThe litigation in appeal centres around the correctness of the deed so drafted by the Superior Court.\nThe boundaries of the parcels of land to which each party is entitled are no longer in dispute. They were confirmed by the Court of King\u2019s Bench and they are now accepted by both the appellant and the respondent. But the parties still persist in every one of the other contentions they put forward at the trial.\nThe Court of King\u2019s Bench was divided on what has now become the main question in the case: the total amount which the appellant must pay to the respondent. Three of the judges of appeal, forming the majority, were of opinion that the annuity was correctly fixed by the trial judge at $2,000, but they thought the respondent was barred from recovering the whole of the arrears of her rent because of the prescription of five years which, they held, applied in this case under arts. 2188, 2250 and 2267 of the Civil Code. For that reason, they reduced the amount of the recovery to $10,000, although they disallowed the credit of $1,600 accepted by the trial judge.\nOf the two remaining judges, one (Hall J.) would have declared that the stipulated annuity was only $800 and that the yearly balance of $1,200 was to be paid Mrs. Ellard out of the profits of the store, which Herbert Ellard guaranteed to the extent of that sum. He discussed at length the accounts between the parties, including the item of $1,600 allowed by the trial judge, and came to the conclusion that the real balance due by the appellant up to the day of the institution of the action was $4,400.20. Yet another calculation was made by the fifth judge (Cannon J.), who thought that the payment of $1,733.35 made by Herbert Ellard to his mother, after the revocation of the power of attorney, should be regarded as final up to that date and who would therefore have computed the arrears of annuity as of that date (September, 1923), with the result that, according to him, the total amount due was $9,066.87, including that sum of $1,733.35.\nAll the judges of appeal agreed that Mrs. Ellard\u2019s grievances against the deed drafted by the trial judge were not to be entertained and they concurred with him in dismissing all the subsidiary conclusions of the action. In fact, the practical result of the appeal, on both sides, to the Court of King\u2019s Bench was a reduction of $2,400 from the amount awarded to Mrs. Ellard.\nThe same questions, except that concerning the demarcation of the lots, were again raised before this court,\nOn the first question, i.e., the annuity payable by Herbert Ellard, we think, like the respondent, that there exists res judicata and that the whole discussion is concluded by the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench in the first case between the same parties.\nIn that case, as already stated, Mrs. Ellard sought the annulment of the agreement of 4th July, 1919, and of the two deeds respectively dated the 23rd June, 1920, and the 14th March, 1921, executed for the purpose of carrying out the agreement, The dispositif of the judgment annulling the two deeds merely stated that the action was maintained\npour ce qui concerne les dits actes de vente du 23 juin 1920 et du 14 mars 1921\nbut one of the points discussed was that Herbert Ellard,\ndepuis qu\u2019il a obtenu de (Mrs. Ellard) ledite acte de vente du 14 mars 1921, ne se pr\u00e9tend plus tenu envers elle qu\u2019\u00e0 une rente viag\u00e8re de $800 par ann\u00e9e.\nThe consideration stipulated in the deeds was $800 instead of $2,000 per year and they were annulled for that reason as appears by the following motif of the judgment:\nConsid\u00e9rant que la cause ou consid\u00e9ration de la vente telle qu\u2019exprim\u00e9e dans ces deux actes de vente, n\u2019est pas celle dont les parties \u00e9taient convenues; que par l\u2019acte du 4 juillet 1919, la demanderesse avait stipul\u00e9 du d\u00e9fendeur, comme consid\u00e9ration de la vente qu\u2019elle s\u2019engageait \u00e0 lui faire, une rente viag\u00e8re de $2,000 par ann\u00e9e; qu\u2019au lieu de cette rente, ce n\u2019est plus qu\u2019une rente de $800 par ann\u00e9e qui figure, comme consid\u00e9ration de la vente, dans lesdits actes de vente; que ce changement a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait sans le consentement de la demanderesse et hors sa connaissance; que la demanderesse n\u2019a pas lu ces actes et n\u2019en a pas eu lecture avant de les signer; * * * qu\u2019elle aurait s\u00fbrement refus\u00e9 de signer, si elle e\u00fbt su que lesdits actes de vente ne faisaient mention que d\u2019une rente de $800 au lieu de celle de $2,000 qu\u2019elle avait stipul\u00e9e; * * * et que, pour cette raison, la demanderesse a le droit d\u2019\u00eatre relev\u00e9e du consentement et de la signature qu\u2019elle a donn\u00e9e.\nAs a rule, under Quebec law, the authority of res judicata applies only to the dispositif (3 Garsonnet, Proc\u00e9dure, p. 239, no. 465 and note 13; 7 Larombi\u00e8re, ed. 1885, no. 18; 20 Laurent, no. 29; 8 Aubry & Rau, p. 369) or, in the language of the code (art. 1241 C.C.), \u201cto that which has been the object of the judgment.\u201d In this case, the object of the judgment was no doubt the annulment of the two deeds. But the judgment \u201cinvolved a determination of the same question as that sought to be controverted\u201d in the present litigation (Spencer Bower on Res Judicata, p. 9), viz.: the amount of the annuity. The reason for the annulment of the deeds was that the consideration of $800 per year there expressed was not in conformity with that of $2,000 per year stipulated in the agreement. Clearly that implied a decision that the true amount of the annuity was $2,000.\nRes judicata will result from the implied decision which is the necessary consequence of the express dispositif in the judgment (Cass. 22 March, 1882; S. 83, 1, 175: Cass. S. 1907, 1, 397; S. 1910, 1, 135).\nLacoste, a foremost authority on the subject, lays down the following rules:\nLa r\u00e8gle d\u2019apr\u00e8s laquelle l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de la chose jug\u00e9e ne s\u2019attache pas aux motifs doit \u00eatre \u00e9cart\u00e9e lorsque les motifs font corps avec le dispositif, lorsque, selon l\u2019expression de la Cour de cassation, ils sont n\u00e9cessaires pour soutenir le dispositif.\nSouvent, en effet, le dispositif ne contient qu\u2019une partie de ce que le juge a d\u00e9cid\u00e9, et l\u2019autre partie se trouve dans les motifs. C\u2019est ce qui se produit \u00e0 chaque instant lorsque le juge doit statuer successivement sur deux points et que la solution donn\u00e9e pour le second est la cons\u00e9quence n\u00e9cessaire de celle qui est donn\u00e9e pour le premier; le juge met la premi\u00e8re solution dans les motifs sous forme de consid\u00e9rant, et le dispositif ne renferme que la seconde. Ainsi le demandeur se pr\u00e9tend le fils de telle personne d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e et r\u00e9clame \u00e0 ce titre la succession; plus d\u2019une fois le tribunal ne constatera la filiation contest\u00e9e que dans les motifs, et le dispositif contiendra simplement l\u2019attribution de l\u2019h\u00e9r\u00e9dit\u00e9. Il est manifeste que, dans les cas de ce genre, l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de la chose jug\u00e9e ne doit pas s\u2019attacher uniquement au dispositif; le jugement contient, en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, deux d\u00e9cisions, l\u2019une renferm\u00e9e dans le dispositif, l\u2019autre ins\u00e9r\u00e9e dans les motifs.\n(Lacoste, De la chose Jug\u00e9e 3e \u00e9d., pp. 92 & 93, & 226-227, et nombreuses autorit\u00e9s en notes.)\nPosons donc en principe, que si un droit a \u00e9t\u00e9 affirm\u00e9 ou ni\u00e9 dans un proc\u00e8s, il y aura identit\u00e9 d\u2019objet si dans un nouveau proc\u00e8s o\u00a1n remet en question le m\u00eame droit, alors m\u00eame que ce serait pour en tirer une autre cons\u00e9quence qui n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9duite dans le proc\u00e8s originaire.\u201d (Lacoste, p. 103, no. 252.) La r\u00e8gle \u00e0 suivre est celle-ci: (says Baudry-Lacantinerie (3e \u00e9d. vol. 15, no. 2677, p. 357), la seconde demande devra \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e toutes les fois qu\u2019elle tend par son objet \u00e0 mettre le juge dans l\u2019alternative, ou de se contredire, ou de confirmer purement et simplement la sentence qu\u2019il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 rendue.\nA similar view of the law is expressed in Juris-Classeur Civil (vo. Contrats\u2014Obligations en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\u2014Div. 155, art. 1351, nos. 57 et 107):\n57.\u2014A. Identit\u00e9 d\u2019objet.\u2014L\u2019objet de la demande est le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice juridique imm\u00e9diat que l\u2019on se propose d\u2019obtenir en la formant.\u2014Pour qu\u2019il y ait identit\u00e9 d\u2019objet, il faut donc que les deux instances portent sur le m\u00eame droit, ou que l\u2019une d\u2019elles porte sur un droit qui fait essentiellement partie int\u00e9grante de celui au sujet duquel le tribunal s\u2019est d\u00e9j\u00e0 prononc\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re d\u00e9finitive. Dans ces cas, en effet (et c\u2019est le crit\u00e9rium de l\u2019identit\u00e9 d\u2019objet), le juge serait mis, par le nouvelle demande, dans l\u2019objection ou de confirmer ou de contredire la premi\u00e8re.\n107.\u2014Mais il ne faut pas confondre l\u2019omission avec la d\u00e9cision implicite (V. supra, n. 47). La premi\u00e8re laisse non r\u00e9solu le point omis qui peut donc faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une nouvelle demande; la seconde, qui d\u00e9coule n\u00e9cessairement de la solution exprim\u00e9e, participe logiquement de son autorit\u00e9, puisqu\u2019elle ne pourrait \u00eatre remise en question sans remettre \u00e9galement en question la d\u00e9cision qui l\u2019impliquait.\nReference might also be made to the judgment of Lamothe C.J., then Chief Justice of the province of Quebec, in Ville de St. Jean v. Quinlan & Robertson[2], and to the decision of the Quebec Court of Queen\u2019s Bench in Stevenson & The City of Montreal & White[3], confirmed by this court[4].\nWe must therefore hold that the judgment delivered on the 23rd February, 1926, by the Court of King\u2019s Bench of Quebec constitutes res judicata as to the amount of the annuity payable by the appellant to the respondent.\nOf course the appellant argues that the revocation of his power of attorney had the effect of reducing the annuity. This was a new contention not apparently raised in the first trial and, at all events, not decided in the judgment just referred to. The power of attorney was revoked in September, 1923. The first action was brought only after that date, but the fact of the revocation could not be urged in support of the two deeds executed long before the revocation. The appellant is right in saying that there is not res judicata as to this point, but he cannot derive any benefit from that fact. He acquiesced in his dismissal as manager of the business and affairs of Mrs. Ellard. Whether he could have made the dismissal a ground for repudiating the whole agreement is not in issue. He elected to proceed with the balance of the agreement as it now stands and to remain in possession of the farms and other properties acquired under the agreement. He must pay the price stipulated therefor. That he should remain manager of the business was no part of the consideration of the conveyance, nor was it made by him a condition for his agreeing to pay the annuity of $2,000.\nThis disposes of the appellant\u2019s objections against the deed drafted by the trial judge. Those put forward by the respondent will be discussed when we come to consider the cross-appeal.\nThere remains to establish the amount due by the appellant when the action was brought and which gave rise to such a diversity of opinion in the courts below.\nFor this, it is necessary to refer to the course of dealing between the parties.\nWhen Herbert Ellard undertook the management of Mrs. Ellard\u2019s \u201cproperty, business and affairs,\u201d he was to receive a salary of $1,200 a year for his services. On the other hand, for the conveyance of the farms, etc., he agreed to pay \u201can annuity of $2,000.\u201d Under the agreement, his salary was payable at the rate of $100 per month. No mention was made of a date when the annuity was to be paid and, therefore, the first instalment became due on the 4th of July, 1920, being one year after the date of the agreement. It may be pointed out that, unless Herbert Ellard received his salary during the year, compensation between it and the annuity took place pro tanto at the expiration of each year and the only sum then due by him to his mother would be the balance of $800.\nThe evidence shews that Mrs. Ellard did not make to Herbert Ellard monthly payments of his salary and that Herbert Ellard did not pay the annuity all at once and in a lump sum at the end of each year, while his management lasted. Instead of so doing, they\nopened up an account in the ledger for (Mrs. Ellard) as she got monies and charged it to her, and (Herbert Ellard) had (his) own personal account in the ledger and he charged (himself) up with the $800 per year and credited (himself) with his salary.\nHe did not receive his salary. It would only \u201cbe credited into the account * * * and the credit was left lying there.\u201d In the same way he credited his farm produce delivered to Mrs. Ellard\u2019s store or hotel. He would take money from time to time and have it charged to the account. So would Mrs. Ellard ask and receive odd sums of money and have it charged in the same way. These accounts were kept by different bookkeepers in the employ of the estate, outside of Herbert Ellard, and most of the entries were made by them. This method of dealing went on from the moment that Herbert Ellard took charge of Mrs. Ellard\u2019s affairs until the revocation of his power of attorney, or from the 4th July, 1919, until the 27th September, 1923. It was to the knowledge and with the consent of both parties.\nThe accounts were in the books of the estate and copies thereof were filed in the case. They shew that, in the fall of 1923, when Herbert abandoned the management, there was a balance of $1,733.35 due Mrs. Ellard. The appellant \u201csquared up his account and went down to her and delivered her a cheque\u201d for that amount, for which she gave him a receipt. The appellant accordingly claimed to have paid his mother up to the time of the revocation. The cheque of $1733.35 was only tendered back by Mrs. Ellard with the return of the writ of summons on or about the 2nd May, 1927, or more than four years later.\nOn this state of facts, it will be apparent that the payment of the salary or of the annuity and the several items pertaining to the administration by Herbert Ellard of the business and affairs of Mrs. Ellard were so bound up together that it would be unfair, not to say impossible, to deal with one without dealing with the other. Charges for farm produce or for salary offset advances of money or payments of annuity and so on. They were made part of one and the same account. As a consequence, it became no longer open to either of the parties to sue on a single transaction or for a specific sum of money, such as for the salary or for the annuity, for the period extending up to the revocation, but the recourse was necessarily by action to account. (Reid v. Brack[5]; Stephens v. Gillespie[6]; Duhamel v. Dunne and La Banque Royale[7].) Chief Justice Lamothe, in the latter case, said (p. 188): \u201cQui doit compte ne doit rien,\u201d dit une maxime souvent cit\u00e9e, ce qui veut dire que celui qui a droit de demander un compte n\u2019a pas de cr\u00e9ance liquide et exigible \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, sa cr\u00e9ance d\u00e9pendant du reliquat qui sera \u00e9tabli sur la reddition de compte, si ce reliquat est en sa faveur, ce qui veut dire, de plus, que le rendant compte n\u2019est, \u00e0 ce moment, d\u00e9 biteur d\u2019aucune dette connue et exigible.\nLes principes que j\u2019\u00e9nonce ci-dessus sont \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires \u00e0 mes yeux.\nThe trial judge picked out a single item of the accounts representing a sum of $1,600, and gave credit for it to the appellant. No doubt the evidence, clear and uncontradicted, amply justified the finding so made but, in the matter of accounting, individual items may not thus be singled out; the account must be discussed as a whole, a balance must be struck and such balance alone may be awarded to the party entitled to receive it.\nThe judgments of the Superior Court and the majority of the Court of King\u2019s Bench fail to follow this principle. For this reason, we think the amount awarded by these judgments is wrong. Having regard to the method adopted by the parties, the whole period covered by the management of Herbert Ellard is one for accounting. Without an account properly rendered and discussed, it is not possible to decide whether there is any sum due and by whom. Provision was made in the agreement for the rendering of an account. The respondent may yet avail herself of the stipulation. She may also make use of the accounts filed in the record by the appellant and bring an action en r\u00e9formation de compte. It is to be hoped that this will not be necessary and that, the parties having now become better informed of their respective rights, will be able to come to terms.\nWe see no harm however, in adjudicating at once that the appellant must pay the sum of $1,733.35 acknowledged by him to be due to the respondent at the end of his administration. (Art. 571 C.C.P.) Upon payment thereof, he will be entitled to withdraw from the record the cheque he gave for that amount on the 24th September, 1923. Due credit of course would then have to be given to the appellant, in discussing the accounts, for the sum thus paid.\nHaving now disposed, at least so far as concerns this case, of the period during which the appellant was managing the affairs of the respondent, it becomes an easy matter to fix the amount owed by the appellant, independently of that period, up to the time of the institution of the action. From September 24, 1923, to 4th July, 1924, the annuity represented an amount of $1,548. Further annuities of $2,000 each came due on the 4th July of the years 1925 and 1926, viz.: $4,000. In 1927, when the action was brought the annuity for that year was not yet due. We cannot in this action make any award in respect of it, nor of any other annuity accruing in the subsequent years, in the absence of an incidental demand on the part of the respondent. (Art. 215 C.C.P.)\nThe total amount due for annuities when the action was brought was therefore $5,548 to which, for reasons already stated, should be added $1,733.35, making a total sum of $7,281.35. As for interest, the courts below decided that it should run \u201cfrom the date of service of the action\u201d and no complaint was made by either party in that respect. In the above view of the case, the question of prescription, on which the majority of the Court of King\u2019s Bench based its judgment, does not arise and does not require to be discussed.\nThis disposes of all the points raised in the main appeal, and we may now turn to those submitted by the respondent on the cross-appeal.\nThe draft deed prepared by the trial judge contains the following stipulation:\nThe above conveyed properties to the purchaser together with all buildings and real improvements thereon will be hypothecated in favour of the plaintiff for the payment of her annuity, but to the extent only of $800 per year.\nThis was approved by the Court of King\u2019s Bench.\nThe respondent contends that she never renounced any part of the privilege which would ordinarily secure the payment of her annuity and that the judgments below are wrong in requiring her to sign a deed whereby her privilege or hypothec over the properties would be limited to $800 a year.\nClause 6 of the agreement of 4th July, 1919 (already, cited) provides in part as follows:\nIn consideration of the agreement by the said Ellen Millar to convey to the said Herbert Millar Ellard, the properties hereinabove mentioned, the said Herbert Millar Ellard agrees to pay to the said Ellen Millar, during her lifetime, an annuity of $2,000, whereof $800 per annum shall constitute a first charge upon the aforesaid properties and $1,200 thereof, to constitute a first charge upon trading and other operations, etc.\nWe agree with the Superior Court and with the Court of King\u2019s Bench that this was a clear renunciation of part of the privilege given by law (Compare Lower St. Lawrence Power Co. v. L\u2019Immeuble Landry Limit\u00e9e[8]. No other purpose could be ascribed to the stipulation. In fact, unless it means a reduction of the privilege, it would lend colour to the contention of the appellant that the annuity was only $800 and that the balance of $1,200 was to be paid out of the earnings of the \u201ctrading and other operations.\u201d\nThe respondent further asked that in case the appellant should fail to pay the annuities that would be awarded, the agreement of 4th July, 1919, be set aside by reason of such default. The courts below have refused to grant such conclusions and the respondent complains of that part of the judgment.\nThe answer lies in article 1536 C.C. which provides:\nThe seller of an immovable cannot demand the dissolution of the sale by reason of the failure of the buyer to pay the price, unless there is a special stipulation to that effect.\nThe agreement, it is true, is only a promise of sale, but the appellant took possession at once of all the properties defined in the judgment and has occupied them ever since. \u201cA promise of sale with tradition and actual possession is equivalent to a sale\u201d (Art. 1478 C.C). Article 1536 C.C. applies to a case of this kind and, in the absence of any stipulation to that effect, the agreement cannot be set aside by reason of the failure of the appellant to pay the price. If it were not so the respondent would yet be precluded from securing the remedy she claims by force of art. 1907 of the Civil Code:\nNon-payment of arrears of a life-rent is not a cause for recovering back the money or other consideration given for its constitution.\nOn both these questions, therefore, we find ourselves in accord with the courts below.\nMoreover, the draft deed for which we are now providing must be that which, according to the agreement, should have been passed on or before the first day of October, 1919. On that day the respondent obliged herself to supplement the agreement by a proper conveyance, but there was no corresponding and simultaneous obligation on the part of the purchaser to pay any part of the price. There was no cash payment to be made, the first payment of annuity would not be due until the 4th July, 1920. Even although, by force of circumstances, the deed will finally be executed only after the date agreed upon, there exists no reason why it should, on that account, be different now from what it should have been then. We see no necessity for making in the deed any reference to a cash payment. All requirements will be met by modifying the draft deed so as to state the consideration as follows:\nan annuity of two thousand dollars ($2,000) per year from and after the fourth day of July nineteen hundred and nineteen, payable by the purchaser to the vendor during her lifetime.\nIt follows that, saving the modification just mentioned, and consequential changes hereinafter indicated, the draft deed annexed to the judgment of the Superior Court should be approved.\nThe cross-appeal must accordingly be dismissed with costs.\nOn the main appeal, the judgment should be modified as indicated and the amount of the condemnation reduced to $7,281.35 with costs to the appellant here and in the Court of King\u2019s Bench.\nIn the draft deed annexed to the judgment of the Superior Court, we would strike out the clause reading as follows:\nThe present transfer and conveyance is so made by the vendor to the purchaser for and in consideration of an annuity of two thousand dollars ($2,000) per year from and after the fourth day of July nineteen hundred and nineteen, payable by the purchaser to the vendor during her lifetime, the vendor acknowledging to have received at the passing of the presents the sum of twelve thousand four hundred dollars ($12,400), being in full of said annuity to the 4th July, 1926;\nand the following clause should be substituted for it:\nThe present transfer and conveyance is so made by the vendor to the purchaser for and in consideration of an annuity of two thousand dollars ($2,000) per year from and after the fourth day of July nineteen hundred and nineteen, payable by the purchaser to the vendor during her lifetime.\nThis however will not remove all difficulties in the path of the parties. The deed drafted by the Superior Court defines the lots which each party is entitled to receive and contains other stipulations in conformity with the agreement of 4th July, 1919; but it can take effect only if and when received before a notary after having been signed by both the appellant and the respondent. We should help the parties to work this out, and provide machinery, so far as we have the right to do it. (Grondin v. Cliche[9].) The party most interested in securing the deed is the appellant. He needs it for purposes of registration. The respondent did not require it to sue for the annuities. If it were otherwise, she could not recover under the present action. It devolves primarily upon the appellant to ensure the execution of the deed.\nUnless this be done by mutual agreement and the deed be properly completed within one month from the present judgment, the appellant is authorized to cause to be prepared by a notary a deed similar to that drafted by the Superior Court, as amended by this court, and to sign it. He may then put the respondent en demeure to affix her own signature to the said deed; and, in default of her so doing within fifteen days after the mise en demeure, the appellant may again come before this court to apply for an order to the effect that the judgment be registered to all intents and purposes in lieu of and to take the place of a deed between the parties.

The appellant claims that the respondent employed him to find a purchaser for an apartment block known as the \u201cBlackstone\u201d in St. Boniface and at the same time named the sum of $100,000 as the price he was willing to accept for the premises. The appellant further says that he then introduced to the respondent one F., the manager of a trust company; and as a result of the appellant\u2019s efforts, this company purchased the apartment block for $100,000. The appellant claims by his action $3,060 representing his commission. The respondent denies most of the material allegations in the statement of claim and alleges that he sold the property through the agency of a different real estate agent.\nThe question at issue in the case was whether, upon the facts, the appellant was entitled to his commission.

Under certain provisions of those Acts the company was empowered to issue bonds secured by a mortgage deed upon the property, assets, rents and revenues of the company. These bonds were to be a \u201cfirst preferential claim\u201d upon the property of the company. Bonds were issued in 1890 and a mortgage deed was duly executed between the company and the trustees of the bondholders. Subsequently, subsidies were granted from time to time by the Dominion Government to the company. On the company failing to operate its road, the Minister of Railways took the necessary steps under section 160 of the Railway Act of 1919 to create a first lien or mortgage upon the railway and its equipment in favour of the Crown for the amount of these subsidies, and for an order authorizing the sale of the railway. The railway was sold under order of court to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company on the condition that the latter would continue the operation of a portion of the original railway line, and the proceeds of the sale were paid into court in accordance with the judgment. The registrar of the Exchequer Court of Canada, acting as referee, under order of the court, in determining the respective ranks and privilege of the creditors, reported that, after the payment of three small claims, the balance of the proceeds of the sale should be paid to the trustee for the bondholders. The Minister of Railways appealed to the Exchequer Court of Canada on the ground that he was entitled to that money; but the report of the referee was upheld by that court.\nHeld, per Anglin C.J.C. and Mignault and Smith JJ., without hearing counsel for the respondents, and affirming the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada ([1928] Ex. C.R. 223), that the balance of the proceeds of the sale has been rightly ordered to be paid to the trustees for the bondholders. The subsidies granted to the railway company were upon condition that the railway should be continuously operated. The fulfilment of that condition to the extent deemed necessary by the Minister of Railways having been secured by the terms of the sale, and no part of the purchase money being required for that purpose, and there being no claim for enforcement of the lien for the amount of the subsidies, the Minister of Railways had no right to claim the balance of the purchase money.\nNewcombe J., on the other hand (with whom Rinfret J. concurred), while unwilling to conclude a question adversely to a party who had not been heard, said that he would be surprised to find that any subsidized Dominion railway, including the defendant company, which \u201ccannot, by reason of the condition of such railway or of its equipment, be safely and efficiently operated,\u201d is not subject to the statutory provisions, and may not, when these have been complied with, * * * be sold to satisfy the first lien or mortgage which the statute creates, and which is, by its express direction, due and payable to His Majesty; and, moreover, if the statute applied, that he was not convinced that the Exchequer Court had authority to regulate the exercise of the Minister\u2019s powers as to the application and disposition of the proceeds.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1] affirming a report of the registrar of that court acting as referee.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nW. Lazure K.C. for the appellant.\nF. S. Rugg K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C. and Mignault and Smith JJ.) was delivered by\nSmith J.\u2014The defendant railway company was incorporated by Dominion statutes of 1887 and 1888, and was authorized to construct a railway in the counties of Compton and Wolfe from the international boundary at Hereford to Lime Ridge, a distance of 48 miles. The railway was built with the aid of subsidies from the Dominion, amounting to $170,560, and from the province, amounting to $84,226.36. One of the conditions of the grant of the Dominion subsidies was that the railroad should be continuously and faithfully operated and kept in good working and running order. By Dominion statute of 1890, the railway company was authorized to lease the railroad and its franchises to the Maine Central Railway Company, with which company\u2019s railroad in Maine the defendant\u2019s railway made connection at Hereford. A lease was accordingly made for 999 years, under which defendant\u2019s railroad was operated until 1st November, 1925.\nUnder authority of Dominion statutes of 1887 and 1889, bonds of the defendant company were issued to the amount of $800,000, and were constituted a mortgage and privilege on the property of the railway and its assets, rents and revenues, save as to working expenses. Pursuant to the terms of the lease, the lessee guaranteed and endorsed these bonds. Having, up to the end of 1923, operated the railroad at a loss of $1,639, 359.63, and having become proprietor of the large majority of the shares of the lessor company, the lessee brought about an agreement between the two companies for cancellation of the lease, as provided by an indenture dated 8th September, 1925, without obtaining statutory authority for such cancellation. The rolling stock and all equipment were then removed to the United States, and operation of the railway ceased.\nThe municipalities petitioned the Minister of Railways and Canals for redress under s. 160 of the Railway Act, which is as follows:\n160. Whenever it is made to appear to the Minister that any railway owned by a company incorporated by the Parliament of Canada, the construction of which has been aided by a subsidy from the Government of Canada, cannot by reason of the condition of such railway or of its equipment be safely and efficiently operated, the Minister may apply to the Board for an order that the said railway, or its equipment, or both, shall be put in a safe and efficient condition, which order the Board is hereby authorized to make after such notice to the president or manager of the company and the trustee of the bondholders, if any, as to the Board seems reasonable, and the Board may, by order, direct what repairs, improvements or additions shall be made to the said railway, or equipment, or both, and within what times the same shall be undertaken and completed respectively.\n2. If the company fails to comply with such order of the Board, the Governor in Council may, upon the recommendation of the Minister, approve of such order, and direct that a copy of such order and of the order of the Governor in Council approving thereof, certified by the secretary of the Board and clerk of the Privy Council respectively, shall be filed by the Minister in the office of the registrar of deeds of each county through which such railway runs, and upon such order being so filed there shall, ipso facto, be created a first lien or mortgage upon the said railway and its equipment in favour of His Majesty for the amount of the said subsidy, which shall immediately thereupon become due and payable to His Majesty.\n3. Such lien may be enforced by His Majesty in the same manner and by the like proceedings as any other lien upon property may be enforced by His Majesty in the Exchequer Court of Canada.\n4. The said court may order such railway and its equipment to be sold to satisfy such lien, and pending such lien may appoint a receiver to\nmanage and operate such railway.\n5. Any, money realized from such sale may, with the consent of the purchaser, be applied by the Minister under the direction of the chief engineer of Government railways towards the repair and improvement of such railway and equipment so far as the same may be deemed necessary by the Minister, and any moneys so realized, and not in the opinion of the Minister required for such repairs and improvements, may be paid to the company owning the railway at the time of the sale, or to the trustee for the holders of any outstanding bonds or other securities secured by mortgage or otherwise upon such railway.\nAll the proceedings provided for by sub-s. 1 were taken, and the defendant railway company having failed to comply with the order of the Board, the proceedings set out in the first part of paragraph 2 were taken for acquiring a first lien or mortgage on behalf of His Majesty for the amount of the subsidy.\nThe Minister then commenced this action, and filed a statement of claim by which, after recital of facts, he claims and demands that the sale of the railway be ordered and decreed by the court on the express condition that the purchaser thereof be required to provide rolling stock, and other accessories necessary to operate said railway, in compliance with the order of the Board of Railway Commissioners. Judgment was given, ordering the sale, and tenders were called for. The tender of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company was accepted, and by the judgment of the court of 25th May, 1927, the railroad and other assets of the defendant company were sold to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company for $46,378, upon the terms and conditions of the tender as follows:\n1. That the Canadian Pacific Railway Company shall not be required to operate and shall not undertake to operate at any time those portions of the railway between Cookshire and Lime Ridge and between Malvina and the international boundary, but shall be at liberty to take up the rails and fastenings on the said portions of the railway and dispose of the same, or dispose of the whole of the said portions of the railway, or any part thereof, as it may see fit.\n2. That the Canadian Pacific Railway Company will within three months from the completion of the purchase commence the operation of the portion of the railway between Cookshire and Malvina with at least three mixed trains a week each way, but its obligations to continue the operation of such portion shall be subject to the law governing railways subject to the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada.\n3. That the purchase price shall be paid to the registrar of the Exchequer Court of Canada upon the passing of title to the property upon the terms aforesaid.\nThe sale and transfer were carried out and the money paid into court in pursuance of this judgment upon the terms stated.\nBy an order of the court, it was referred to the registrar to enquire and report on all claims to the proceeds of the sale, and to determine the respective ranks and privileges of the creditors. The referee reported that three small claims should be first paid, and that the balance should be paid to the trustees for the bondholders. The Minister of Railways appealed from this report in so far as it directs the balance to be paid to the trustees for the bondholders, on the ground that he is entitled to have such balance paid out to him. This appeal was dismissed by judgment of the 18th October, 1928, and the Minister appeals to this court.\nIt has been argued that, as s. 160 of the Railway Act was first enacted in 1911, many years after the incorporation of the defendant railway company and the building of the railway, and after the bondholders had acquired vested rights under statutory authority, it should not be held to have any retroactive effect, and should be deemed to have reference only to railways subsequently built. It is also argued that this results from the proper construction of the wording of the Act.\nIt is not, however, necessary to deal here with that question. There was judgment for sale of the railroad under s. 160, and no appeal was taken from that judgment. The sole question, therefore, that need now be dealt with is as to the disposition of the balance of the proceeds of the sale now in court.\nI am in accord with the learned referee in the disposition he has made of that balance, for the reasons fully and clearly stated by him.\nThe subsidies granted to defendant railway company were, as stated, upon condition that the railway should be continuously and faithfully operated and kept in good working and running order. Section 160 provides that, on proceedings taken under that section and default to comply with the order made by the Board of Railway Commissioners for the safe and efficient operation of the railway, there shall be created a first lien and mortgage upon the railway and its equipment for the amount of the subsidy, which may be enforced in the Exchequer Court. If proceedings were taken merely to enforce this lien and recover back the subsidies, the property covered by the lien would be sold with clear title, unencumbered by onerous conditions and undertakings to be assumed by the purchaser, and the amount of the subsidies would be first paid out of the proceeds of sale and the balance would go to the owner or its bondholders. The subsidies having been thus paid back, there would remain no further obligation to anyone to equip or operate the railway. This is not what the Minister asked to have done in the present case. He made no request in the statement of claim for enforcement of a first lien for the subsidies. What he asked for and what he and the municipalities evidently desired was such a sale as would bring about the fulfilment of the condition continuously and faithfully to operate the railway and keep it in good working and running order. That condition once fulfilled at the instance of the Minister by resort to the property of the defendant company, there would be no right to recover the subsidies, as s. 160 does not empower the Minister to recover the subsidies and also enforce performance of the conditions. The defendant company\u2019s railroad and assets were sold subject to and charged with the obligation of fulfilling the conditions on which the subsidies were granted to the extent to which the Minister judged it desirable to exact the fulfilment of these conditions. The fulfilment of these conditions to the extent deemed necessary by the Minister having been secured by the terms of the sale, and no part of the purchase money being required for that purpose, and there being no claim for enforcement of the lien for the amount of the subsidies, the balance of purchase money in question should, as found by the learned Referee, be paid, as directed by sub-s. 5 of the section, to the owners or the trustees for the bondholders. There can be no object in first handing it to the Minister, to be by him passed on to the trustees for the bondholders.\nThe appeal is therefore dismissed with costs. Newcombe J. (Rinfret J. concurring).\u2014The facts are not in dispute, but it is well to have in mind the following particulars:\nThe Hereford Railway Company, declared to be a work for the general advantage of Canada, was incorporated by Dominion Acts of 1887, ch. 93, and 1888, c. 81, and constructed the railway in question, with the aid of Dominion and provincial subsidies. The Dominion subsidy agreements, which are statutory, as therein recited, are dated 31st March, 1888, and 3rd August, 1889. As stated in the recitals, the railway was to be constructed\naccording to descriptions and specifications and upon conditions to be approved by the Governor in Council, upon a report of the Minister of Railways and Canals, specified in an agreement to be made by the company with the Government,\nand, in consideration of the subsidy to be paid, the company covenanted and agreed:\n6. That the company will upon and after completion of the said line of railways and works appertaining thereto, truly and faithfully keep the same and the rolling stock required therefor, in good, efficient working and running order, and shall continuously and faithfully operate the same.\nUnder authority of the Dominion statutes above mentioned, the company issued bonds dated 1st May, 1890, payable in forty years, secured by mortgage of 24th October, 1890.\nSection 160 of the Railway Act was enacted by c. 22, s. 13, of 1911, as s. 369A, and was introduced into the Consolidated Railway Act, c. 69 of 1919, as s. 160.\nThe railway ceased to be maintained or operated on 1st November, 1925, and so remained in a state of inactivity until after the proceedings which led to the sale under the above section 160.\nThe respondents admit in their factum:\nThat the appellant has carried out the procedure set forth in article 160 and that subsidies had been received by the Hereford Railway Company to the extent of $170,560.\nThe Minister proceeded in the Exchequer Court to enforce the lien, which, assuming the application of the statute, he admittedly possessed, and the court exercised the jurisdiction which it had to order the sale of the railway \u201cto satisfy such lien.\u201d Lest there should be any error as to the footing upon which the proceedings were understood, considered and dealt with in the Exchequer Court, I introduce the following extract from the registrar\u2019s report. Referring to the date, 1st November, 1925, when operation of the railway was abandoned, the report proceeds:\nIn order that the operation of the railway should be continued the Minister of Railways and Canals petitioned the Board of Railway Commissioners for an order directing the Hereford Railway Company to operate the railway with the necessary equipment. On the 1st day of April, A.D. 1926, an order of the Board of Railway Commissioners was issued and served upon the Hereford Railway Company. The railway company having failed to comply with the said order the Minister took the necessary steps under paragraph 2 of section 160 of the Railway Act to create a first lien or mortgage upon the railway and its equipment in favour of His Majesty for the amount of the subsidies granted from time to time by the Dominion Government to the Hereford Railway Company, and for an order authorizing the sale of the said railway. The amount of the Dominion subsidies totals one hundred and seventy thousand five hundred and sixty dollars ($170,560) according to the claim of the Minister of Railways and Canals filed before the undersigned on the reference as exhibit 15. Thereafter proceedings were taken by the Minister of Railways and Canals on behalf of His Majesty under the provisions of subsection 2 of section 160 of the Railway Act 1919, to enforce the lien for the subsidies paid in the Exchequer Court of Canada.\nFollows a discussion, extending to three printed pages of the record, intended to demonstrate that section 160 should not be applied retrospectively, or, as it is said, so as to affect vested rights; from which the conclusion seems to be drawn that the statute does not apply in this case. Nevertheless, it is directed that the proceeds of the sale realized under the statute shall be paid to the bondholders, because, as is said, it is unnecessary for the Minister to exercise the powers conferred upon him by subsection 2 of s. 160 and it is suggested that a spirit of equity should control.\nThe case was heard upon appeal in this court, and, after hearing the appellant\u2019s counsel, a majority of the court was so fully satisfied with the result below that it was considered unnecessary to hear counsel for the respondents.\nFor my own part, I would not conclude a question adversely to a party who has not been heard, but perhaps I may be permitted to say with propriety that I would be surprised to find that any subsidized Dominion railway, including the defendant company, which\ncannot, by reason of the condition of such railway or of its equipment, be safely and efficiently operated,\nis not subject to the statutory provisions, and may not, when these have been complied with, as they admittedly have been in this case, and after notice to the president or manager of the company and the trustee of the bondholders, which is also for present purposes admitted, be sold to satisfy the first lien or mortgage which the statute creates, and which is by its express direction due and payable to His Majesty. Moreover, if the statute applies, I am not convinced that the Exchequer Court has authority to regulate the exercise of the Minister\u2019s powers as to the application and disposition of the proceeds.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Wilfrid Lazure.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Frederick S.

The appellant, by his defence, denied in general terms that the bank was holder in due course of the notes. The Court of King\u2019s Bench unanimously concurred with the view of the trial judge that the bank was entitled to enforce payment of the notes up to the amount chargeable against them by the bank as pledgee; and the Supreme Court of Canada affirmed that decision.\nBut the respondent bank cross-appealed on two grounds: first, that it was entitled to judgment against the appellant for the full amount of the notes and interest, and secondly, that it should be reimbursed the amount of certain costs paid to the appellant as the costs of a successful appeal made by the latter in respect of some promissory notes of which due notice of dishonour had not been proved; and the bank relied upon the terms of Dussault\u2019s letter of hypothecation, which authorized it to charge as pledgee \u201ctoutes les d\u00e9penses encourues et les d\u00e9bours\u00e9s faits par la banque \u00e0 ce sujet.\u201d\nAs to the first ground, the Supreme Court of Canada agreed with the view of the majority of the judges of the Court of King\u2019s Bench that, on the whole evidence, the respondent bank\u2019s claim was not valid, in so far as it rested upon the existence of a liability on the part of the appellant to Dussault. And on the second point, the Supreme Court of Canada affirmed the judgment of the court appealed from rejecting that claim, on the ground that, prima facie, the bank\u2019s liability for these costs resulted directly from its own fault and nothing in the letter of credit authorized it to put upon its customer the burden of a disbursement exacted from it under such circumstances.\nAppeal and cross-appeal dismissed with costs.\nLouis A.

Moreover, the information laid against some of the applicants, which describes the informant, as a customs and excise officer acting \" on behalf of His Majesty the King \" was quite sufficient to justify the magistrate in proceeding with the trial. R. v. Limerick (37 C.C.C. 344) and R. v. Ed. (47 C.C.C. 196) dist.\nPer Rinfret J.\u2014On an application for habeas corpus, a contention by the petitioner that no proof of the authority of the informant was adduced at the trial does not raise a question of jurisdiction: if the judge before whom the application is made is right in his view that the magistrate had the right to enter on, and proceed with, the case, he had not to consider the sufficiency of the evidence on which the former was convicted. R. v. Nat Bell Liquors ([1922] 2 A.C. 128, at pp. 151, 152) foll. Per Rinfret J. Under sections 127 and 128 of the Excise Act, a magistrate has the power both to imprison and fine the accused by summary conviction and is not restricted to impose one penalty to the exclusion of the other.\nPer Rinfret J.\u2014When the order of imprisonment is absolute for a term and a further term is imposed in default of payment of a fine and costs, the conviction and commitment of the inferior tribunal are severable. Therefore, when a petitioner urges, as a ground for the issue of a writ of habeas corpus, the illegality of the part dealing with the further imprisonment, such application is premature before the expiration of the term for which the conviction imposed an absolute order of imprisonment; up to that time, the applicant cannot complain that he is illegally restrained of his liberty.\nPer Rinfret J.\u2014Where a warrant of commitment contains a valid order of imprisonment and also an order imposing a lighter fine than the minimum imposed by the statute, this order being illegal, the portion providing for imprisonment is nevertheless valid; and the illegal order can still be remedied by applying the provisions of sections 754 and 1125 of the Criminal Code.\nPer Rinfret J.\u2014A warrant of commitment requiring the payment of the costs of conveying the accused to jail is not invalid for failure to state the amount of these costs.\nPer Rinfret J.\u2014The word \" penalties \" in par. 2 of s. 4 of the Opium and Narcotic Drugs Act means the imprisonment and the fine and does not include the costs. Therefore, a condemnation to a fine of \" two hundred dollars\" will not be invalid as being a lighter fine than the minimum ($200 and costs), imposed by section 4, par. (d) (b)2(?) of that section. Moreover, nothing in the Act compels the magistrate to award costs; and in such a case, section 735 of the Criminal Code, under which the costs are in the discretion of the magistrate, would apply.\nThe judgments of Rinfret J., in chambers, rendered upon these four applications for habeas corpus, were, on appeal, affirmed by the Court,\nHeld, that, in the cases of Henderson, Broder and Joe Go Get, the warrant of commitment shewed a valid conviction, and even assuming it to be defective because the amount of the costs is not stated, that would not be a ground for discharging the prisoners on habeas corpus: Section 1121, Criminal Code.\nHeld, also, that, in the Stewart case, assuming the defects alleged on behalf of the prisoner, he is not at present held under any of the defective clauses, and the application is at best premature.\nAPPEAL from the judgments of Rinfret J. dismissing petitions for a writ of habeas corpus.\nThe material facts, and the grounds of the petitions are sufficiently set out in the judgments of Rinfret J. now reported.\nThe appeal from the judgments was dismissed.\nThe petitions were heard by Rinfret J. on June 4, 1929. Stuart Henderson for the applicants.\nE. F. Newcombe K.C. for the Attorney-General for British Columbia.\nP. D. Wilson, for the Minister of Justice and the Minister of National Revenue.\nOn June 5, 1929, Rinfret J. gave judgment as follows:\nRINFRET J.:\u2014\nIn re John Henderson.\nIn re John George Broder.\nThe applicant Henderson complains that he is illegally detained in custody in Oakalla Prison Farm, a common gaol for the county of Vancouver, and prays for the issue of a writ of habeas corpus directed to W. G. McMynn, the warden of the prison, and for his subsequent discharge.\nThe same relief has already been refused by the late Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of British Columbia and by Mr. Justice W. A. Macdonald, a judge of the same province[1].\nAccording to the warrant of commitment by reason of which he is held prisoner, Henderson was convicted before H. O. Alexander, a stipendiary magistrate in and for the county of Vancouver, for that he,\non December 5, 1928, at Pocahontas Bay, in the county of Vancouver, unlawfully, without having a licence under the Excise Act then in force, did have in his possession a still suitable for the manufacture of spirits, without having given notice thereof as required by the Excise Act, such still not having been a duly registered chemical still of capacity not exceeding three gallons, as provided for in the Excise Act, contrary to the form of statute in such case made and provided\nand he was adjudged\nto be imprisoned in the common gaol for the said county of Vancouver at Oakalla Prison farm, Burnaby, in the county of Westminster, in the province of British Columbia, for the term of twelve months,\nand also that he shall\nforfeit and pay the sum of five hundred dollars ($500) to be paid and applied according to law and, in default of payment of the said sum of $500, that he should be imprisoned in the said common gaol for the county of Vancouver in the county of Westminster for a further term of six months unless the said sum of $500 and the costs and charges of conveying (him) to the said common gaol should be sooner paid. The warrant commanded the constables or peace officers in the county of Vancouver to take and convey Henderson\nto the common gaol at Oakalla Prison Farm aforesaid and there to deliver him to the said keeper thereof, together with this precept;\nand commanded the keeper to receive Henderson\ninto (his) custody in the said common gaol and there to imprison him for the term of twelve months.\nThe warrant further commanded the keeper to imprison Henderson\nfor the further term of six months to commence at the expiration of the said term of twelve months awarded by the sentence above set out unless the said sum of $500 and the costs and charges of the commitment and of the conveying of the said Henderson *** to the said gaol are sooner paid unto the said keeper or until he shall be otherwise discharged in due course of law.\nThe application is based on a number of grounds and I will endeavour to consider and determine them in the order in which they are submitted to me:\n1. The trial magistrate is alleged to have been\nwithout jurisdiction to try the case and to take proceedings on the information sworn or to act thereon\nbecause the informer\ndid not swear that he was an excise officer or acting under instructions from the Minister of National Revenue, and the proceedings were void ab initio, as no averment is sufficient in excise cases.\nThere is authority in this court for the proposition that, on the return of a writ of habeas corpus, the only consideration which can be entered upon by a judge of the Supreme Court of Canada is the sufficiency of the commitment. (In re Tr\u00e9panier[2]; In re Sproule[3]; Ex parte McDonald[4].\nIn this case, however, the applicant further complains that the magistrate neglected\nto show in the warrant and conviction that the proceeding by summary conviction was by virtue of the authority of the Minister of National Revenue, Department of Excise, ss. 133 and 134 of the Excise Act.\nAnd, in addition to a copy of the warrant of commitment, the petitioner has filed before me, without objection from the Crown, copies of the conviction, of the information and other papers accompanied by an affidavit, to show the alleged want of jurisdiction. I find nothing in sections 133 and 134 of the Excise Act to the effect that the commitment must show the proceedings to have been held\nby virtue of the authority of the Minister of National Revenue, Department of Excise.\nThe offence, of which Henderson is stated in the warrant to have been convicted, is covered by s. 176 (e) of the Excise Act where it is declared to be an indictable offence, (although by force of section 127 of the Act, the penalty or forfeiture and the punishment may be sued for and recovered or imposed by summary conviction). The offence is not in terms one which is only cognizable upon the information of a specified class of persons. All provisions of the criminal code relating to indictable offences apply to it (see Interpretation Act, c. 1 of R.S.C. 1927). It may therefore be argued with great force that anyone, upon reasonable or probable grounds, may make a complaint or layan information against an accused person in respect of such offence. (Crim. Code, s. 654). There are sections of the Excise Act giving special powers to inspectors and officers appointed under it for the purposes of entry into buildings, or into the premises of any dealer, of inspection and examination of apparatus, works, stills, etc.; also, under the authority of a writ of assistance, for the purpose of searching for, seizing and securing goods or things liable to forfeiture under the Act and of arresting and detaining any person whom they detect in the commission of any offence against the provisions of the Act. No powers are stated to be required to lay an information in respect of an offence under s. 176; and counsel for the petitioner was unable to point to any section of the Act having that effect.\nShould we, however, infer from the provisions of the Excise Act taken as a whole that officers of excise alone are competent to lay informations concerning offences against section 176, even then it is not necessary, though perhaps desirable, to specify particulars of the informant in the warrant of commitment (Paley on Summary Convietions, 9th ed. p. 470). This would dispose of the argument that the authority of the informant is not shown in the warrant of commitment.\nAssuming however that \"for the purpose of an inquiry into the case of commitment\" (which is the extent of my jurisdiction under s. 62 of the Supreme Court Act) I should go behind the warrant, I find in the information laid against Henderson, and of which he himself filed a copy before me, that the informant is therein described as a customs and excise officer acting \" on behalf of His Majesty the King \". The information was taken and sworn before the stipendiary magistrate and, in my view, the oath of the informant covered the particulars relating to his capacity and authority to act. This was quite sufficient (Crim. Code 1128) to justify the magistrate in proceeding with the trial, even if it be true that only an officer of excise could lay the information.\nI will say nothing of the fact that, admittedly, this point was not taken at the trial.\nI am not overlooking the decisions in Rex v. Limerick[5], and Rex v. Ed.[6] In addition to what I have already said upon the points which they cover, I may add that neither case was an application for habeas corpus. Rex v. Limerick[7] was a proceeding for the enforcement of the Inland Revenue Act and was before the court on an order for certiorari. It was there made to appear that the informant was not an officer of the department of Inland Revenue and, at the hearing, the magistrate's jurisdiction had been challenged. In Rex v. Ed[8], a case was stated for the opinion of the court after the appellant was found guilty in a prosecution under the Income War Tax Act, and\nas stated by the magistrate, it was not alleged in the information or shown in the evidence before him that (the informant) was authorized by the Finance Department or any other department of the Government to lay the information or otherwise to enforce the provisions of the Income War Tax Act (Rex v. Ed.[9] ).\nBoth cases are distinguishable from the present one.\nAs to the contention that no proof of the authority of the informant was adduced at the trial, I would say that it does not raise the question of jurisdiction. If I am right in my view that the magistrate had the right to enter on the case, I am not to consider the sufficiency of the evidence on which he convicted. (In re Tr\u00e9panier[10]. In the words of Lord Sumner, re Rex v. Nat. Bell Liquors[11], A justice who convicts without evidence is doing something that he ought not to do, but he is doing it as a judge, and if his jurisdiction to entertain the charge is not open to impeachment, his subsequent error, however grave, is a wrong exercise of a jurisdiction which he has, and not a usurpation of a jurisdiction which he has not ***. To say that there is no jurisdiction to convict without evidence is the same as saying that there is jurisdiction if the decision is right, and none if it is wrong; or that jurisdiction at the outset of a case continues so long as the decision stands, but that, if it is set aside, the real conclusion is that there never was jurisdiction.\nFor all these reasons the petitioner fails on the first ground of his application.\n2. The second ground may be stated as follows: The information was first laid before P. C. Parker, stipendiary magistrate. It was afterwards withdrawn and a new information was laid before H. O. Alexander, another stipendiary magistrate whose jurisdiction, so it is contended, was barred by sections 85 (4) and 129 of the Excise Act.\nSection 85 must be disregarded. It has no application to this case, which is not a prosecution under its provisions, but, as already stated, a proceeding by summary conviction under sections 176 and 127 of the Act (as amended by c. 24 of 18-19 Geo. V).\nSection 129 reads as follows:\n129. If any prosecution in respect of an offence against any provision of this Act is brought before a judge of a county court, or before a police or stipendiary magistrate, or before any two justices of the peace, no other justice of the peace shall sit or take part therein: Provided, however, that in any city or district in which there are more than one judge of a county court, or more than one police or stipendiary magistrate, such prosecution may be tried before any one of such judges or police or stipendiary magistrates.\nIt is not disputed that Alexander, the stipendiary magistrate who tried the case, found the conviction and signed the commitment, had jurisdiction territorially and otherwise to try a case of this kind, but it is contended that he could \" not sit or take part therein \", because the prosecution was brought first before P. C. Parker.\nOn the facts as stated, section 129 does not apply. The information laid before Parker having been withdrawn, Alexander cannot be said to have sat or taken part in a prosecution brought before Parker. But whatever the facts may have been, they are not apparent on the face of the warrant of commitment and, under the well settled jurisprudence of this court referred to in Ex parte McDonald[12] my jurisdiction in the present case \"is limited to an inquiry into the cause of commitment, that is, as disclosed by the warrant of commitment\".\nThe second ground of attack cannot therefore be entertained by me.\n3. As a third ground for the application, it is contended that the magistrate\nhad no power to imprison and fine by summary conviction, but that he could only do one or the other.\nSections 127 and 128 of the Excise Act afford a complete answer to this contention. The offence of Henderson must be taken to have been his first offence, inasmuch as the commitment does not shew otherwise. Under section 176, the penalty for a first offence is\na penalty not exceeding $2,000 and not less than $200 and to imprisonment, with or without hard labour, for a term not exceeding twelve months and not less than one month, and, in default of payment of the penalty, to a further term of imprisonment not exceeding twelve months and not less than six months.\nSection 127 (as amended by c. 24 of 18-19 Geo. V.) reads in part as follows:\n127. (1) Every penalty or forfeiture incurred and any punishment for any offence against the provisions of this Act, or any other law relating to excise, may be sued for and recovered, or may be imposed (a) before the Exchequer Court of Canada or any court of record having jurisdiction in the premises; or (b) if the amount or value of such penalty or forfeiture does not exceed five thousand dollars and such punishment does not exceed twelve months imprisonment with hard labour, whether the offence in respect of which it has been incurred is declared by this Act to be an indictable offence or not, by summary conviction, under the provisions of the Criminal Code relating thereto, before a judge of a county court, or before a police or stipendiary magistrate, or any two justices of the peace having jurisdiction in the place where the cause of prosecution arises, or wherein the defendant is served with process.\n*****\n(3) Any such pecuniary penalty may, if not forthwith paid, be levied by distress and sale of goods and chattels of the offender, under the warrant of the court, judge, magistrate, or justices having cognizance of the case; or the said court, judge, magistrate, or justices may, in its or their discretion, commit the offender to the common gaol for a period not exceeding twelve months, unless the penalty and costs, including those of conveying the offender to such gaol and stated in the warrant of committal, are sooner paid.\nSection 128 reads:\n128. Any term of imprisonment imposed for any offence against the provisions of this Act, whether in conjunction with a pecuniary penalty or not, may be adjudged and ordered\n(a) by the Exchequer Court of Canada, or any court of record having jurisdiction in the premises; or (b) if such term of imprisonment does not exceed twelve months, exclusive of any term of imprisonment which may be adjudged or ordered for non-payment of any pecuniary penalty, whether the offence in respect of which the liability to imprisonment has been incurred is declared by this Act to be an indictable offence or not, by summary conviction under the provisions of the Criminal Code relating thereto by a judge of a county court, or by a police or stipendiary magistrate, or any two justices of the peace having jurisdiction in the place where the cause of prosecution arises, or wherein the defendant is served with process.\nAs will have been noticed, section 127 alone was sufficient in this case to found jurisdiction in the stipendiary magistrate; and section 128 applies when the term of imprisonment is imposed \" whether in conjunction with a pecuniary penalty or not.\"\n4. The next contention in support of the application is that the warrant of commitment is bad\nin neglecting to state where the defendant was found or the cause of prosecution arises.\nThe warrant states\nthat the said John Henderson *** on December 5, 1928, at Pocahontas Bay, in the county of Vancouver, unlawfully *** did have in his possession a still, etc.\nH. O. Alexander, before whom Henderson was found guilty and was convicted, is \" a stipendiary magistrate in and for the said county of Vancouver.\" The jurisdiction appears on the face of the proceedings. Moreover, courts would take judicial notice of the \" local divisions of their country.\" (Taylor on Evidence, 10th ed., 17; Sleeth v. Hurlbert[13].)\nNor was it necessary, as urged by counsel, that, at the time of the arrest, Henderson should have the still in his own actual possession at Pocahontas Bay. Having possession includes as well having in the custody of any other person or having in any place for the benefit or use of one's self or of any other person (Criminal Code, s. 5).\n5. Then it is contended that the warrant is bad, \"by neglecting to show to whom the fine is to be paid,\" the words used being: \" to be paid and applied according to law.\"\nThe warrant shews that Henderson is condemned to an imprisonment of twelve months and also to a fine of $500, and to a further imprisonment of six months unless the said sum of $500 \" should be sooner paid.\" The further term of six months is to commence at the expiration of the said term of twelve months awarded by the sentence above set out unless the said sum of $500 and the costs and charges of the commitment and of the conveying *** to the said jail are sooner paid unto *** the said keeper.\nTo avoid further imprisonment, Henderson knows from the warrant that he must pay to the keeper. Assuming that he is concerned with the subsequent appropriation of the fine, s.s. 133 and 134 of the Excise Act make a complete and determinate disposal of it. If they did not, art. 1036 of the Criminal Code would apply. So that the judgment can be unequivocally carried into effect by reference to the Act alone (R. v. Seal [14]).\n6. The last objection taken by the petitioner is as to the question of costs. It is urged by him\nthat the conviction and warrant do not comply with the statutes in regard to \" costs of conveying to gaol \" or costs of \" commitment.\"\nUnder s. 127 of the Excise Act, the magistrate could\ncommit the offender to the common gaol for a period not exceeding 12 months, unless the penalty and costs, including those of conveying the offender to such gaol and stated in the warrant of committal are sooner paid.\nThe adjudication in the warrant now before me, in default of payment of the fine of $500, is that Henderson should be imprisoned\nfor a further term of six months unless the said sum of $500 and the costs and charges of conveying (him) to the said common gaol should be sooner paid.\nThen, in the operative part of the warrant, the keeper is commanded to imprison him for the further term of six months *** unless the said sum of $500 and the costs of the commitment and of the conveying *** to the said gaol are sooner paid unto *** the said keeper.\nBut the further term of six months is to commence (only)\nat the expiration of the said term of twelve months awarded by the sentence.\nHenderson complains that:\n(a) The costs of commitment were not adjudged against him and that yet, under the warrant, he will have to remain six months in prison, unless he pays them.\n(b) The amount of the costs which he must pay is not stated in the commitment.\nHenderson was validly convicted on the 5th January, 1929. It was then validly adjudged, for the offence of which he was legally found guilty, that he should be im- prisoned for the term of twelve months. It is not disputed that the punishment is perfectly good under the statute. The term of twelve months will expire only on the 5th day of January, 1930. Until then he cannot complain that he is illegally restrained of his liberty, nor kept in illegal confinement. The warrant of commitment is sufficient for the keeper to retain him in gaol until the expiration of the term of twelve months for which the conviction imposed an absolute order of imprisonment.\nWhere the order of imprisonment is absolute for a term and a further term is imposed in default of payment of a fine and costs, the conviction and commitment of an inferior tribunal are severable. This proposition has now been accepted by our courts. The court of appeal for Ontario in The King v. Carlisle[15]; the Court of King's Bench (appeal side) of Quebec in La Commission des Liqueurs de Qu\u00e9bec v. Forcade[16]; and the Court of Appeal for British Columbia in Rex v. Fox [17]; to which may be added the opinion of Mr. Justice Beck of the Court of Appeal for Alberta in Rex v. Miller [18]. I see no reason to differ from these judgments.\nPaley on Summary convictions (8th ed. at p. 201) admits that an order is divisible and \" may be quashed in part \", and, as said in Rex v. Robinson[19], quoted by Mr. Justice W. A. Macdonald in his judgment on a similar application[20],\nthere is no reason worthy of the name to be found in the books why there should be any distinction in this respect between an order and a conviction.\nI therefore think that, so far as concerns that portion of the warrant of commitment dealing with further imprisonment in default of payment of fine and costs, the application is premature. I do not want however to be understood as meaning that that part of the commitment is invalid. The writ of habeas corpus is a prerogative process available when \" there is a deprivation of personal liberty without legal justification \" (Halsbury, Laws of England, vol. 10, p. 48). Courts should not permit the use of this great writ to free criminals on mere technicalities. It is the spirit of our Criminal Laws and more particularly of our law on summary convictions that defects and informalities be corrected so as \" to prevent a denial of justice \" (Crim. Code 723, 753, 754, 1120, 1124, 1125 and 1129).\nI have been referred to a number of judgments holding a warrant of commitment invalid because it required payment of conveyance to gaol and it did not state the amount of those costs. I have noticed that none of the learned judges who have so decided took the trouble of telling us at the same time how the magistrate, so as to insert the amount in the warrant, could determine in advance the costs of conveyance. I fully agree with what is said on that point by Murphy J. in Rex v. Wong[21]. A proper method\u2014and there should be others\u2014for the determination of those costs is set out in Poulin v. City of Quebec[22] where Sir Fran\u00e7ois Lemieux, at page 392, decides as follows:\nBy this petition for habeas corpus (the petitioner) demands to be discharged on two main grounds, *** ;\nsecondly, because the conviction should have stated the amount of conveying the petitioner to gaol.\nThis last ground is without foundation.\nThe condemnation for the costs includes the cost of conveyance, and these expenses, contrary to the claim of the petitioner, should not, and could not, be included in the conviction.\nWhen the law permits conviction for costs, it includes, not only the costs of the prosecution but also those of carrying out the judgment of the conviction.\nIt is impossible for the magistrate or the Recorder's Court, and it is not in a position to fix and determine in advance the cost of conveyance. These costs are, or should be, stated or certified by the officer who executes the commitment upon the back of the commitment, which is the general practice and which was done in this very case. The certificate authorizes the jailer to require payment of the amount if the offender desires to be discharged from gaol.\nIn this case, I have, for the above reasons, come to the conclusion that the objections fail to support the application for the prisoner's release and the said application will therefore be dismissed.\nIn the case of George Broder, the conviction and the warrant of commitment are identical and for a similar offence; the application is based on exactly the same grounds as that of John Henderson and it will accordingly be dismissed for the same reasons. In re James Stewart\nThis is an application for habeas corpus by James Stewart, formerly of the city of Vancouver and at present imprisoned at Oakalla Prison Farm, Burnaby, county of Westminster, province of British Columbia.\nThe offence for which Stewart was convicted, the conviction and the warrant of commitment are similar to those in the cases of John Henderson and George Broder. The grounds of the application are the same, except one which I shall state presently. For the reasons already given in dismissing the petitions of Henderson and Broder, to which I refer the parties and their counsel, I think the similar objections raised in this case fail to support the application for Stewart's release.\nThe other ground, which was available neither to Henderson, nor to Broder, consists in the following:\nIt was adjudged by the conviction, as appears by the warrant of commitment, that Stewart should be imprisoned for the term of six months, and it was also adjudged that he should forfeit and pay the sum of $100 to be paid and applied according to law; and it was further adjudged that, in default of payment of the said sum, Stewart should be imprisoned\nfor a further term of two months, unless the said sum of $100 and the costs and charges of conveying (him) to the said common gaol should be sooner paid.\nThe operative part of the warrant of commitment is in the same terms, except that the keeper is commanded also to exact \" the costs and charges of the commitment\", in addition to those \" of the conveying \", before he discharges the prisoner.\nUnder section 176 (d) of the Excise Act, the offence of which Stewart was found guilty is an indictable offence (though triable by summary conviction-s. 127) and made him liable to a penalty\nnot exceeding $2,000, and not less than two hundred dollars, and to imprisonment, with or without hard labour, for a term not exceeding twelve months and not less than one month, and, in default of payment of the penalty, to a further term of imprisonment not exceeding twelve months and not less than six months.\nAs will have been perceived, the absolute order of imprisonment for a term of six months is within the limitation contained in the enactment. Stewart is now detained in gaol under a perfectly good award of imprisonment and the commitment, as well as the conviction, is a legal and sufficient warrant for the gaoler to keep him in prison.\nThere seems to be no doubt however that the magistrate had no power to impose less than the minimum fine or to order imprisonment, in default of payment of fine and cos's, for a term shorter than prescribed by the statute.\nAccording to the Interpretation Act (c. 1 of R.S.C. 1927, s. 28)\nEvery Act shall be read and construed as if any offence for which the offender may be\n(a) prosecuted by indictment, howsoever such offence may be therein described or referred to, were described or referred to as an indictable offence;\n(b) punishable on summary conviction, were described or referred to as an offence; and\nall provisions of the Criminal Code relating to indictable offence, or offences, as the case may be, shall apply to every such offence.\nBy force of sections 1028 and 1029 of the Criminal Code the magistrate had no discretion to inflict a punishment or to award a fine or a penalty outside the limitations contained in s. 176 (e) of the Excise Act. And section 1054 of the same code provides\nthat no one shall be sentenced to any shorter term of imprisonment than the minimum term, if any, prescribed for the offence of which he is convicted.\nI think therefore that the conviction for a fine of $100 and the adjudication of imprisonment for a further term of two months, in default of payment of the fine and costs, were bad and illegal.\nHad Stewart, at the present time, been kept in gaol because of his failure to pay the fine of $100 and costs, I would not however have maintained the writ of habeas corpus. Applying section 1120 of the Criminal Code, I would have made an order for the further detention of Stewart and have directed the magistrate, under whose warrant he is in custody,\nto do such further act as *** may best further the ends of justice.\nAnd it may not be out of place to draw the attention of the petitioner to the fact that by s. 1125 of the Criminal Code,\nthe punishment imposed being less than the punishment by law assigned to the offence stated in the conviction or order\nis treated as an irregularity which may be dealt with in all respects as the court may do upon appeal under section 754 of the Code. Section 1125 has reference to convictions removed by certiorari, but there is no apparent reason why an order to a similar effect could not be made on habeas corpus under s. 1120 of the code.\nI am not however so deciding. In my reasons for judgment on the similar petitions of John Henderson and George Broder, I have explained why I thought that the conviction as made in this case was severable. It consists first in an absolute order for the payment of a fine. By the terms of the conviction and of the warrant, the term of two months, in default of payment of the fine, is \" to commence (only) at the expiration of \" the absolute term of imprisonment of six months. The conviction and warrant are dated the 5th day of January, 1929. The six months will expire only on the 5th day of July. In the meantime and at present a valid case of detention is shewn, the petitioner is legally in gaol and he cannot succeed in his present application. The application is therefore dismissed.\nIn re Joe Go Get\nJoe Go Get, was, on the 23rd January, 1929, convicted before Thos. McClymont, a police magistrate, for that he\ndid have in his possession a drug, to wit prepared opium, without lawful authority, contrary to the provisions of section 4 (d) of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1923, and amendments thereto.\nHe was adjudged to be imprisoned for the term of six months. He was also adjudged to forfeit and pay the sum of $200, and he was further adjudged, if the said sum was not sooner paid, to be imprisoned\nfor the additional space of three months to commence at and from the expiration of the term of imprisonment aforesaid.\nJoe Go Get was imprisoned under a warrant of commitment reciting the above conviction and now applies for his release from custody by habeas corpus. He says his conviction, as appears by the commitment, is incomplete and in improper form and contrary to the Opium and Narcotic Act because:\n1. The penalty imposed is less than the minimum penalty which may be awarded under the Act.\n2. There is no adjudication as to costs, which is necessary in such an offence.\n3. The conviction and warrant of commitment do not \" provide for costs and charges of commitment.\" The offence of which Joe Go Get was found guilty is covered by section 4 (d) of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, which made him liable\nupon summary conviction, to imprisonment with or without hard labour for any term not exceeding eighteen months\nand not less than six months, and to a fine not exceeding\none thousand dollars and costs and not less than two hundred dollars and coss.\nThen paragraph 2 of section 4 says:\n2. Notwithstanding the provisions of the Criminal Code, or of any other statute or law, the court shall have no power to impose less than the minimum penalties herein prescribed, and shall, in all cases of conviction, impose both fine and imprisonment; * * *\nIn the present case, no objection is taken to the absolute term of imprisonment imposed, but the sum ordered to be forfeited and paid as a fine is only two hundred dollars, and it is argued that this was illegal and outside the jurisdiction of the magistrate because, under the Act, the fine may not be less than two hundred dollars and costs. The conclusion would be that either a fine for the minimum amount without costs is below the penalty imperatively prescribed or that the conviction is bad because it contains no adjudication as to costs.\nI do not so understand the statute, and I read it as Murphy J. did in Rex v. Wong Yet [23].\nSection 4 (2) of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act must be applied\nnotwithstanding the provision of the Criminal Code, or of any other statute or law.\nFor the determination of this objection, I must therefore look only to the provisions of the Act. The Act says that\nthe court shall have no power to impose less than the minimum penalties herein prescribed.\nI think the word \" penalties \" means the fine and the imprisonment and does not include the costs. The magistrate\nshall, in all cases of conviction, impose both fine and imprisonment.\nHe may not impose a fine alone, or an imprisonment alone. He must not impose a term of imprisonment or a fine outside the limitations contained in the enactment, but the costs remain in his discretion. Applying this interpretation to the wording of the relevant section 4d (b), I would say that the magistrate could, as he has done in this case, impose a fine of $200, without speaking of the costs. The words \" not less than \" in the section apply to the \" fine \" only; and the \" fine \" does not comprise \" the costs.\" This is shown by section twelve of the Act, whereby when \" the conviction adjudges payment of a fine,\" the sentence may direct that in default of payment of the fine\nand costs, the person so convicted shall be imprisoned until such fine and costs are paid, etc.\nThe limitation in s. 4 applies therefore to the penalties, being the imprisonment and the fine, but not to the total amount of fine and costs. The object of the enactment \" according to its true intent, meaning and spirit \" is that the minimum fine may be imposed, outside of the costs.\nNor do I think that an adjudication as to costs is necessary for such an offence. There is no provision making it so. The effect of section 4d (b) even were I to put upon it the construction suggested by counsel for the petitioner, would not be that costs must be ordered to be paid by the person found guilty, it would be that the combined amounts of fine and costs may not be less than $200, a result which to my mind only goes to strengthen the view I have expressed on the first ground of this application.\nOutside of section 4d (b), no other sections of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act were pointed to me compelling the magistrate to award costs. In such a case the provisions of the Criminal Code apply (Interpretation Act, s. 28, c. 1 of R.S.C., 1927).\nIn summary matters under the Criminal Code, costs are in the discretion of the magistrate (s. 735) and, as said by my brother Mr. Justice Duff in the Marino case (22nd August, 1927, not reported), I cannot\nassume that the police magistrate did not judicially consider and pass upon that question.\nWhat I have just said also applies to the costs and charges of commitment. I may add that I fail to see what interest the petitioner may have of complaining on habeas corpus that the warrant of commitment makes no mention whatever of those costs. The only effect is that he will not have to pay them in order to escape restraint of liberty.\nThe application is dismissed without costs.\nThe appeal from the above judgments was heard by the court, composed of four judges (s. 28 (2), Supreme Court Act), on June 13, 1929. Stuart Henderson for the appellants.\nJ. A. Ritchie K.C. for the Attorney General for British Columbia.\nP. D. Wilson for the Minister of Justice and the Minister of National Revenue.\nOn June 14, 1929, the court delivered its judgment affirming the judgments of Rinfret J.\nTHE COURT.\u2014In the cases of Henderson, Broder and Joe Go Get, the warrant of commitment shews a valid conviction, and even assuming it to be defective because the amount of the costs is not stated, that would not be a ground for discharging the prisoners on habeas corpus : Section 1121, Criminal Code. It is not necessary to express any opinion on the question of severance. The appeals are dismissed.\nIn the Stewart case, assuming the defects alleged on behalf of the prisoner, he is not at present held under any of the defective clauses. The statute clearly contemplates that the proceedings are not wholly void, for there are curative provisions which, in the meantime, may be invoked. If these are not available to this court, they may nevertheless conveniently be resorted to elsewhere, and, in the interests of justice, it seems right that the Crown should not be deprived of its judicial remedies.\nWe think therefore that this application is at best premature, and should be dismissed.\nAppeals dismissed.\n[1] [1929] 2 W.W.R. 209.\n[2] (1885) 12 Can.

But a person at large on bail is not so restrained of his liberty as to entitle him to the writ.\nMOTION by the applicant for the issue of a writ of habeas corpus. The facts are fully stated in the judgment of Mr. Justice Rinfret.\nA. H. Tanner, K.C., for the applicant.\nA. W. Rogers, for the Attorney-General for Ontario.\nRinfret J.\u2014The application is for a writ of habeas corpus.\nIt is based on a number of grounds, most of which have already been submitted to the Supreme Court of Ontario upon motion to quash the information and other proceedings. The motion was heard by McEvoy J., in chambers, who confirmed the commitment in a very elaborate judgment[1]. Upon appeal, his judgment was affirmed by the Appellate Division[2].\nUnder such circumstances, it is not usual for a judge of the Supreme Court of Canada to interfere with the decision of the provincial courts (In re Patrick White[3]), but see remarks of the Chief Justice quoting Lord Herschell in In re Seeley[4]. Had I felt that the petition, on its face, presented serious grounds, I would have deemed it advisable to refer the matter to the full court (In re Richard[5]; In re Gray[6]).\nBut there is, to my mind, a preponderating objection against the issue of the writ.\nThe prisoner is on bail.\nThe present Ontario Act (R.S.O. 1927, c. 116, s. 1) applies \u201cwhere a person * * * is confined or restrained of his liberty\u201d.\nThe Act of 1866 (29-30 Vict. 45) was similar:\nwhen any person shall be confined or restrained of his or her liberty, etc. (Sec. 1);\nand the writ was to be\ndirected to the person or persons in whose custody or power the party so confined or restrained shall be, etc.\nBlackstone, in his Commentaries dealing with the common law writ of habeas corpus, says:\nThe great and efficacious writ, in all manner of illegal confinement, is that of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum directed to the person detaining another, and commanding him to produce the body of the prisoner, with the day and cause of his caption and detention, and to do, submit to, and receive whatsoever the judge or court awarding such writ shall consider in that behalf.\nHalsbury, Laws of England (vol. 10, no. 90), refers to the writ as\na prerogative process for securing the liberty of the subject by affording an effective means of immediate release from unlawful or unjustifiable detention, whether in prison or in private custody. It is a prerogative writ by which the King has a right to inquire into the causes for which any of his subjects are deprived of their liberty.\nThere is a passage of Hawkins\u2019 Pleas of the Crown (vol. II, pp. 138-139) to the effect\nthat the person bailed is in the eye of the law, for many purposes, esteemed to be as much in the prison of the court by which he is bailed, as if he were in the actual custody of the proper gaoler.\nI do not think however that, generally speaking, a person discharged on bail may be considered as restrained of his liberty for the \u201cpurpose\u201d of entitling him to a writ of habeas corpus.\nI was referred to a sentence in Lord Campbell\u2019s judgment re Foxhall v. Barnett[7], where he says:\nThe plaintiff was released only from imprisonment within four walls: he still had to restore himself to a state of freedom; which he did not do until he had the inquisition set aside: till then the imprisonment was not done away with.\nBut this was in an action for false imprisonment, where the \u201cinquisition\u201d was quashed on certiorari; and the question was whether plaintiff was entitled, under an allegation that he had incurred expenses in procuring his discharge from custody, to recover damages for the expense of quashing the inquisition. Having regard to the nature of the case, I would interpret the words of Lord Campbell as meaning that, until the \u201cinquisition was set aside,\u201d the plaintiff was threatened with imprisonment and any expense incurred for the purpose of \u201cdoing away with\u201d it was justifiably incurred.\nThe only decision in the Canadian courts that I have been able to find, and I was referred to no other, is that of The Queen v. Cameron[8]; but there the petitioner was a physician who resided in the province of British Columbia. He was arrested in that province and brought to Montreal, in the province of Quebec, to answer a charge of defamatory libel. When he was committed for trial, the judge admitted him to bail to appear at the November term of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, \u201cand in the meantime not to depart the court without leave.\u201d He had not therefore the privilege of going when and where he pleased. No bill of indictment was preferred against him during the two next ensuing terms of the court. He then moved, under a special provision of the statute of Lower Canada (An Act respecting the writ of Habeas Corpus\u2014C.S.L.C., c. 95, s. 7), that his bondsmen be released, and that the recognizance entered into by them and himself be discharged and vacated. The provision of the Act was\nthat when a person has been committed for a felony and, having prayed to be brought to trial, is not indicted during the next term of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench after such commitment, the court shall, upon motion made in open court, set the prisoner at liberty upon bail, unless it be shown that the witnesses could not be procured for that term, and, after having asked to be brought to trial, if he be not indicted and tried at the second term after his commitment, that he be discharged from his imprisonment.\nWurtele J. granted the motion and discharged the prisoner. In so doing he used the following language:\nBut bail is custody and he is constructively in gaol; and he has the same right to be released from his custody as he would have to be released from imprisonment.\nThe learned judge was addressing himself to the question whether the section applied, notwithstanding the fact that the petitioner was not actually in gaol, and he came to the conclusion that it did. He held that, under the section, a person, who was not indicted and tried for two consecutive terms after his commitment, had an equal \u201cright to be released\u201d whether in prison or under bail. The decision turned exclusively upon the construction of the statute and the very exceptional circumstances of the case.\nIn my view, in order to make a case for habeas corpus in criminal matters, there must be an actual confinement or, at least, the present means of enforcing it. A person may apply for the writ while in the custody of a constable, immediately upon being arrested, and need not wait until he is actually incarcerated. But a person at large on bail is not so restrained of his liberty as to entitle him to the writ. There are numerous decisions in that sense in the United States. They may be found conveniently collected in the American and English Encyclopedia of Law, 2nd ed., vol. 15, vo. Habeas Corpus, at p. 159. In fact, bail is one of the alternative remedies which may be granted upon application for habeas corpus. See The Habeas Corpus Act (R.S.O. 1927, c. 116, s. 7):\n7. Although the return to a writ of habeas corpus is good and sufficient in law the court or judge before whom the writ is returnable may examine into the truth of the facts set forth in the return, by affidavit or other evidence, and may order and determine touching the discharging, bailing, or remanding the person.\nThe Act of 1866 contained the following provision (29-30 Vict., c 45, s. 3):\nAnd if upon such return it shall appear doubtful on such examination, whether the material facts set forth in the return, or any of them, be true or not, in such case it shall and may be lawful for the said judge or the court to let to bail the said person so confined or restrained, upon his or her entering into a recognizance, with one or more sureties;\nAs to the statute 31 Car. 2, in re Robert Evan Sproule[9], Sir W. J. Ritchie C. J., said at p. 181:\nThe statute of 31 Car. 2 was to provide that persons committed for criminal, or supposed criminal matters in such cases where by law they were bailable should be left to bail speedily.\nTo the above may be added s. 63 of the Supreme Court Act:\n63. In any habeas corpus matter before a judge of the Supreme Court, or on any appeal to the Supreme Court in any habeas corpus matter, the court or judge shall have the same power to bail, discharge or commit the prisoner or person, or to direct him to be detained in custody or otherwise to deal with him as any court, judge, or justice of the peace having jurisdiction in any such matters in any province of Canada.\nAt present, the prisoner is at liberty on bail. He has himself selected that means of avoiding confinement and incarceration. He is on bail on his own application since November, 1928. We are now in May, 1929, and his trial is now proceeding in Toronto.\nI should not interfere. The application is dismissed without costs.\nMotion dismissed without costs.\n[1] (1928) 62 Ont.

Turgeon (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nThe Dominion Bank (Defendant) Respondent.\n1929: May 13, 14; 1929: September 26.\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Mignault Newcombe Rinfret and Smith JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING\u2019S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nBank and banking\u2014Advances made to trader\u2014Fire insurance policies\u2014Transfer of eventual claim of loss as security\u2014Validity\u2014Interpretation of statutes\u2014Observations on maxim \u201cexpressio unius est exclusio alterius\u201d\u2014Arts. 1981, 2472, 2474, 2432, 2568, 2571 C.C.\u2014Bank Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 12, s. 75\u2014Bankruptcy Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 11, ss. 63, 64.\nL., a merchant, was a customer of, and, in due course of business, received advances from, the respondent bank. In order to secure the repayment of moneys which he had borrowed, or intended to borrow, L. took out various policies of fire insurance upon his stock, making the loss, if any, payable to the bank. The policies were kept in force, and a fire occurred whereby the stock insured was destroyed or damaged. L. then became bankrupt and the appellant was appointed trustee. The latter brought an action against the respondent bank to recover the proceeds of the fire insurance policies which had been paid to the bank, and which, the appellant alleged, amounted to a fraudulent preference.\nHeld, that a bank is authorized, under s. 75 of the Bank Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 12, to make to an insured advances upon, or take from him as security, the obligations of fire insurance companies to pay to him the indemnities stipulated in case of loss. The enumeration, contained in clause (c) of subs. 1 of s. 75, of certain negotiable securities upon which the bank may lend money and make advances does not have the effect of limiting the generality of the comprehensive power separately conferred by clause (d), so as to exclude the general lending powers which appertain to banking. The maxim \u201cexpressio unius est exclusio alterius\u201d enunciates a general rule of interpretation in the construction of statutes and written instruments in order to discover the intention; but that maxim is not of universal application.\nHeld, also, that the clause in the policy \u201cLoss, if any, payable to the Dominion Bank\u201d does not have the effect of creating an assignment of the insurance policies to the bank, which had no insurable interest in the goods insured; but that stipulation operates only in the event of loss, and gives effect to the intention of the parties that the indemnities to which the insured may become entitled shall be paid to the bank as the nominee of the insured, the latter remaining bound by and subject to the terms of the policies.\nJudgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Q.O.R. 47 K.B. 383) aff. APPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1] affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, at Montreal, Archer J., and dismissing the appellant\u2019s action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nP. St. Germain K.C. for the appellant.\nL. E. Beaulieu K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nNewcombe, J.\u2014M. Lavut & Son, who were merchants, carrying on business in Montreal, had insured their stock in trade against fire in five insurance companies; the policies were issued severally at various times, and in different amounts, from 21st February, 1923, to 6th June, 1926; and, in order to secure the payment of moneys which the firm had borrowed, or intended to borrow, from the defendant bank, these policies, with one exception, contained the provision, in the body of the policy, \u201cLoss, if any, payable to the Dominion Bank.\u201d The excepted policy was the first of the series, and it was issued to the assured, M. Lavut & Son, by the Alliance Assurance Company, Limited. By its terms,\nThe company agree with the assured (subject to the terms and conditions endorsed hereon which are to be taken as part of this policy) that if, after payment of the premium, the property above described, or any part thereof, shall be destroyed or damaged by fire at any time between the hour of noon of the tenth day of January, 1923, and noon of the tenth day of January, 1924, (standard time at the place of location of the property insured), the company will make good by payment or reinstatement or repair all such loss or damage, to an amount not exceeding in respect of the several matters specified in this policy the sum set opposite thereto respectively and not exceeding in the whole the sum of three thousand dollars.\nForm 2 of the blank endorsements printed on the back of this policy was filled up and executed in August, 1924, as follows: Endorsements\nForm no. 2,\u2014Loss payable clause\nIn case of loss the amount for which the company shall be liable shall be payable to Dominion Bank of\nSigned at Montreal the 8 August 1923 by\nM. LAVUT & SON\nper D. Lavut,\nAssured.\nThe company hereby accepts the above notice that the loss (if any) under this policy shall be payable to the said Dominion Bank. Signed at Montreal, the 11th August, 1924, by\nE. E. KENYON,\nPer R. Stewart,\nManager.\nThe policies were kept in force, and a fire occurred on 20th September, 1926, whereby the stock insured was destroyed or damaged; the firm became bankrupt, presenting a petition on 13th October, 1926, which was granted on that day, and, on 11th November, 1926, the plaintiff became the trustee.\nThe following facts, among others, are stated in the admissions:\n4. All these fire insurance policies were remitted to the defendant at the dates of the issue of the policies for those which were originally made \u201closs payable if any to the Dominion Bank\u201d and on August 8, 1924, in so far as the Alliance Assurance Company Limited is concerned, and were all held by the defendant as security for advances made and to be made by the defendant to M. Lavut & Son, until the occurrence of the fire, on September 20, 1926.\n5. At the time of the bankruptcy of the said J. Lavut & Son and of the fire, the latter was indebted to the defendant in the sum of $8,731 (as shown by sworn proof of claim now in the hands of the plaintiff, \u00e8squalit\u00e9).\n6. The said sum of $8,731 was the balance of an account on advances made from time to time by defendant to the said M. Lavut & Son against the securities held by defendant.\n7. After the fire the defendant received out of the fire insurance policies a total of $3,436.79, by cheque made by those fire insurance companies, each cheque payable to M. Lavut & Son and to the defendant, at the different dates mentioned in the evidence, and endorsed by M. Lavut & Son.\nThe purpose of the action is to have it declared\n* * * que les cessions des indemnit\u00e9s par l\u2019assur\u00e9 M. Lavut & Son, \u00e0 la d\u00e9fenderesse, provenant des diverses polices d\u2019assurance ci-dessus mentionn\u00e9es, soient d\u00e9clar\u00e9es frauduleuses, nulles et ill\u00e9gales;\nand that the plaintiff trustee be adjudged to recover the indemnities for distribution among the creditors. Archer J., the learned trial judge, dismissed the action, and, upon appeal, he was upheld unanimously by the Court of King\u2019s Bench[2].\nThe errors now alleged are three; it is contended, first, that the courts below erred in holding that the bank was authorized, under s. 75 of The Bank Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 12, to make advances upon, or to take as security, the obligations of fire insurance companies to pay the indemnities stipulated in case of loss; secondly, that the clause, \u201cLoss, if any, payable to the Dominion Bank,\u201d did not operate otherwise than as an assignment of the insurance policies to the bank, and could not have that operation, inasmuch as the bank had no insurable interest in the property insured; and, thirdly, to use the words in which the point is stated, that the courts were wrong\nIn finding that such an assignment of the eventual indemnities arising out of the fire insurance policies did not constitute an illegal preference towards the other creditors of the insured, inasmuch as it was made in prevision of an event which necessarily had to render said insured insolvent.\nRespecting the first point, I should be reluctant to suggest a doubt as to the right of a trader to make his fire insurance available as a security to a bank in the manner adopted in this case, or as to the power or capacity of a bank to take or hold such a security. The argument arises upon the interpretation of s. 75 of The Bank Act, and it is said that, inasmuch as clause (c) of subs. 1 expressly mentions certain securities, including \u201cbills of exchange, promissory notes and other negotiable securities,\u201d upon which the bank may lend money and make advances, it could not have been intended that the next following clause (d), of the same subsection, should extend to securities not included in the preceding specific description. But that is practically, and unnecessarily, to limit the generality of the comprehensive power separately defined by clause (d) so as to exclude the lending powers which appertain to banking. The words of the clause are these:\nThe bank may * * *\n(d) engage in and carry on such business generally as appertains to the business of banking.\nThe maxim, expressio unius est exclusio alterius, enunciates a principle which has its application in the construction of statutes and written instruments, and no doubt it has its uses when it aids to discover the intention; but, as has been said, while it is often a valuable servant, it is a dangerous master to follow. Much depends upon the context. One has to realize that a general rule of interpretation is not always in the mind of a draughtsman; that accidents occur; that there may be inadvertence; that sometimes unnecessary expressions are introduced, ex abundanti cautela, by way of least resistance, to satisfy an insistent interest, without any thought of limiting the general provision; and so the axiom is held not to be of universal application.\nIt depends upon the intention of the parties, as it can be discovered upon the face of the instrument or upon the transaction;\nper Lord Campbell, L.C., in Saunders v. Evans[3]; McLaughlin v. Westgrath[4].\nIt is not denied that the transaction in question belongs to the business of banking within the meaning of clause (d), if that clause be not limited by the implied exception for which the plaintiff contends, and it must be remembered that, according to the frame of the Act, exceptions or prohibitions are intended to be expressed by subs. 2 of s. 75. These do not suggest any intention to exclude the lending of money upon securities, merely because the securities are not of the class which is described as negotiable; and the maxim is thus, perhaps, more aptly available to the bank when it contends that, since certain securities not foreign to the business of banking are expressly prohibited, it may be inferred that other securities of that character remain within the scope and operation of the general clause. Several provincial decisions of high authority are cited by the learned judges of the Court of King\u2019s Bench in support of the bank\u2019s power, and there is none to the contrary. My own view is that the Parliament, in introducing the securities enumerated by clause (c) of subs. 1, evidently did not intend to make those enumerations comprehensive, and that, so far as any question arising in this case is concerned, clause (d) was meant to have its full effect, subject to the provisions of subs. 2. Moreover, it is difficult to escape the inference from subs. 3 that insurance may be placed for the security of a bank; on the contrary, it is expressly provided that\nNothing herein contained shall prevent such bank from requiring such insurance to be placed with an insurance company which it may approve.\nSecondly, it is urged that the bank, having no insurable interest in the goods insured, was not qualified to receive payment of the amount of the loss under the direction to that effect embodied in or endorsed upon the policies, and the plaintiff relied upon several articles of the Quebec Civil Code, namely, 2472, 2474, 2482, 2568 and 2571, but they do not support his contention. It is said that the words under which the bank claims have effect as an assignment of the policies, but that is not so. The stipulations operate only in the event of loss, and give effect to the intention of the parties that the indemnities to which the assured have become entitled shall be paid to the bank as the nominee of the assured, the latter remaining bound by and subject to the terms of the policies which have been contracted. It seems unnecessary to add to the discussion which this question received in the reasons given by the learned judges of the Court of King\u2019s Bench; but it may be observed that the considerations which they advanced are supported, not only as matter of fair interpretation, but also by the authorities in Ontario and in the United States. See, inter alia, McPhillips v. London Mutual Fire Insurance Company[5]; Fogg v. Middlesex Mutual Fire Insurance Co.[6]; Minturn v. Manufacturers\u2019 Insurance Co.[7]; Frink v. The Hampden Insurance Co.[8].\nI find it somewhat difficult to realize the authority or principle which underlies the third objection. We are referred to art. 1981 of the Civil Code, and it is said that the transaction amounts to an illegal preference under the Bankruptcy Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 11; but the article in question is not intended to prevent a debtor from creating a valid security; and, as to the Bankruptcy Act, admittedly none of these securities was given within the period of three months limited by s. 64 of that Act; and, moreover, there is evidence uncontradicted that the assured were not insolvent previously to the fire. It was also said that the claim of the bank was invalidated as a transfer of future book-debts under s. 63, which seems to be a hopeless contention. The good faith of the transaction is not justly impeached, and our attention has not been directed to any invalidating provision which applies.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: St. Germain, Raymond & St. Germain.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Myerson & Sigler.\n[1] (1928) Q.O.R. 47 K.B. 383.\n[2] (128) Q.O.R. 47 K.B. 383.\n[3] (1861) 8 H.L.C. 721, at pp. 728, 729.\n[4] (1906) 75 L.J.P.C. 117, at p. 118.\n[5] (1896) 23 Ont.

Newcombe, Lamont and Smith JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE BOARD OF RAILWAY COMMISSIONERS FOR CANADA\nRailways\u2014Order of Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada against corporation operating street railway system for contribution to cost of subways constructed under steam railway tracks\u2014Railway Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 170, ss. 39, 257, 259, 44 (3)\u2014Jurisdiction of Board under the Act\u2014Appeal from Board\u2019s order for contribution\u2014Whether appellant \u201cinterested or affected by\u201d the order for construction of the subways\u2014Jurisdiction of Parliament of Canada to enact legislation in question.\nThe Toronto Transportation Commission, which operates the street railways in Toronto, appealed from the order of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada requiring it to contribute to the cost of two subways on Bloor Street and one on Royce Avenue, which were constructed under certain steam railway crossings by order of the Board under its powers under s. 257 of the Dominion Railway Act. The appellant, whose Bloor Street lines had not previously crossed the railway tracks, but had led towards them on each side thereof, constructed its tracks through the Bloor Street subways, thus establishing a continuous line along Bloor Street, and now operates cars thereon. It does not operate through the Royce Avenue subway, nor are there any tracks on that street.\nHeld, as to the Bloor Street subways, that the appellant was \u201cinterested or affected by\u201d (Railway Act, s. 39) the order directing the work, and the Board had jurisdiction under said Act to order it to contribute to its cost. (As to appellant\u2019s contention that in operating the street railways it was a mere agent of the city corporation and could not be required to contribute, it was held that, whatever might be its rights and remedies against the city, the appellant, as an operating corporation in control of the street railways, and entrusted with their full management, could be treated by the Board as a company or person to which s. 39 of said Act applied, subject, of course, to its interest being shewn).\nHeld, as to the Royce Avenue subway, that the appellant was not \u201cinterested or affected by\u201d the order directing the work, and the Board had not jurisdiction under said Act to order it to contribute. This was so, notwithstanding that the construction of the subway involved a certain diversion of Dundas Street, which street had been, and is now in its diverted course, used by appellant. (Per Mignault and Lamont JJ.: Not being interested in the subway, appellant could not be said to have an interest in the diversion. Moreover, the contribution exacted from appellant took no account of the cost of the diversion as distinguished from the cost of the subway, the contribution being to the whole expenditure. Per Newcombe J.: There was no finding that appellant derives a benefit from the method provided for the approach or discharge of traffic from and to the subway as between Dundas Street and Royce Avenue; and there was no reason to believe that the Board intended to impose part of the subway cost as compensation for advantages said to accrue by reason of the diversion of Dundas Street. If, on the contrary, as the case seemed to suggest, the Board was anticipating value which might be realized when, if ever, a branch of the tramway is constructed through the subway, the Board would not have jurisdiction to order payment under s. 39 of the Railway Act; it cannot be said that a person is interested merely because in the future he may become so). Anglin C.J.C. and Smith J. dissented on this question, holding that, in connection with the construction of the subway, the diversion of the situs of appellant\u2019s tracks on Dundas Street involved such a division and diversion of traffic as probably to effect an improvement for the street railway over conditions theretofore existing; and it was impossible to hold that it had been shewn that appellant had not a present interest, different in kind from that of the ordinary residents in, or users of, the city streets, in the changes effected, by the Board\u2019s order for construction of the subway, still less that it was wholly unaffected by that order; as to whether such interest or affection was too slender to justify the order for contribution, that was a question of degree, involving the sufficiency in extent of the interest or affection, as to which the discretion exercised by the Board could not be interfered with.\nThe Railway Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 170, ss. 39, 257, 259, 44 (3), 33 (5), considered. Toronto Ry. Co. v. Toronto, [1920] A.C. 426, cited. Held, also, that the Parliament of Canada had jurisdiction to confer upon the Board the authority held to be given by the provisions of the Act to compel contribution, under the circumstances of the case, from the appellant, a provincial corporation. Toronto v. Can. Pac. Ry. Co., [1908] A.C. 54; Toronto Ry. Co. v. Toronto, 53 Can. S.C.R. 222.\nAPPEAL by the Toronto Transportation Commission (by leave of a judge of this Court, and upon a settled statement of facts) from an order of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada directing that the appellant contribute a certain portion of the cost of certain subways, constructed by order of the Board, in the city of Toronto.\nThe appellant is a corporation established under c. 144 of the Statutes of Ontario of the year 1920, and is the administrative body charged with the operation of the street railways in the city of Toronto, all of which belong to the City. There were three subways in question, two on Bloor street (between Lansdowne avenue and Dundas street), and one on Royce avenue. One of the Bloor street subways is under the tracks of the Galt subdivision of the Canadian Pacific, the Brampton subdivision of the Canadian National, and the Toronto, Grey & Bruce subdivision of the Canadian Pacific (which cross Bloor street side by side). The other Bloor street subway is under the tracks of the Newmarket subdivision of the Canadian National. The subway on Royce avenue is under the tracks of the said Galt, Brampton, and Toronto, Grey and Bruce subdivisions.\nThe description and location of the streets and railway lines in question and the situation with regard to them prior to the scheme for construction of the subways in question sufficiently appear in the judgments now reported. The settled statement of facts contained, inter alia, statements, in effect, as follows:\nOn November 21, 1922, the City of Toronto applied to the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada for an order requiring the Canadian National to collaborate with the City in the preparation of a joint plan for the separation of grades at Bloor street and Royce avenue as well as at a number of other streets in the northwestern section of the city.\nA hearing of the said application was held by the Board in Toronto on February 14, 1923. As a result of the hearing the parties agreed to study the matter and submit a report to the Board.\nAt a hearing by the Board held in Toronto on January 8, 1924, plans were submitted by the City and the Railways and discussed. Various organizations and ratepayers\u2019 associations in the city of Toronto which were affected were represented at the hearing, and it was urged by them as well as the City of Toronto that one of the reasons requiring protection by grade separation at these crossings was to enable the Transportation Commission to extend its lines of street railway across the tracks so as to give the residents of the northwestern section of the city a better and more continuous street car service. It was also stated that the Transportation Commission would possibly in the future extend its lines of street railway across the tracks of the steam railways at Royce avenue. The hearing was adjourned for the purpose of allowing further study of the plans submitted.\nA further hearing of the Board was held in Toronto on February 19, 1924, notice of which was sent by direction of the Board to the Transportion Commission, which had not previously appeared, and the bodies operating other public utilities interested in or affected by the plans submitted. The Transportation Commission appeared at this and subsequent hearings, reserving its rights, and took part in the final argument, as to the distribution of cost, at the same time stating that it was immaterial to it whether the subways in question were constructed or not. At these hearings exhaustive enquiry and discussion took place covering the various general schemes submitted, including the proposed methods of dealing with the crossings at Bloor street and the proposal of the Canadian Pacific to divert Dundas street as part of the Royce avenue grade separation. It was shown that Dundas street was a heavily travelled main artery with a double track street railway, extending along and immediately adjacent to the westerly limit of the steam railway right of way from a point some distance south of Royce avenue to a point just north of that crossing. The Canadian Pacific proposal, which provided for the diversion of Dundas street, including the street railway tracks, at its then level with easy approaches to the subway in both directions on the original location of the street, was supported by the evidence of an independent experienced engineer, called on behalf of a body of citizens of West Toronto, and was adopted by the Board. The diversion runs from the corner of Humberside avenue and Dundas street on a tangent through to Dundas street at the corner of Indian road, thus avoiding the dangerous condition of heavy traffic coming upon a busy street with street car tracks which would have resulted from the construction of the subway at Royce avenue, if Dundas street and the street railway tracks had not been diverted.\nAs a result of these hearings the Board, acting under its powers for the protection, safety and convenience of the public, issued its order no. 35037, dated May 9, 1924, approving the general plans submitted by the Canadian Pacific for grade separation in the northwestern section of the city including subways under the tracks of the Canadian Pacific Galt and Toronto, Grey & Bruce Subdivisions and the Canadian National Brampton Subdivision at Bloor street and Royce avenue and under the tracks of the Canadian National Newmarket Subdivision at Bloor street.\nOn May 21, 1924, a further hearing of the Board was held in Toronto to discuss the details of the works from an engineering standpoint, to give directions as to the portions to be undertaken forthwith and to hear arguments on the question of distribution of the cost of the subways ordered to be constructed. Following this hearing the Board issued its order no. 35153, dated June 5, 1924 (amended by order no. 35308, issued July 10, 1924), which directed that work on the subways be undertaken and provided inter alia as follows:\nThat all questions of distribution of costs, interest or other matters involved in the construction of the said work be reserved for further order of the Board.\nOn July 15, 1925, the Transportation Commission applied to the Board for an order under s. 252 of the Railway Act, granting it leave to construct for the Corporation of the City of Toronto, a double track line of street railway, between Dundas street and Lansdowne avenue along Bloor street.\nBy order no. 36693, dated August 13, 1925, the Board granted the said application and reserved for further consideration the question of contribution to the cost of said subways by the applicant. Under the authority so granted to it, the Transportation Commission did, during the course of construction of the subways, construct a double line of street railway tracks along Bloor street from Lansdowne avenue to Dundas street and through the subways constructed pursuant to the Board\u2019s order and the Transportation Commission now operates street cars through the said subways.*\nThe Transportation Commission does not operate street cars through the subway at Royce avenue.\nOrders of the Board were issued authorizing the Canadian Pacific and the Canadian National to use and operate the subways carrying their tracks over the streets as aforesaid.\nOn November 15, 1926, the Board issued its formal order no. 38424, distributing the cost of construction of the said subways and directing that the Transportation Commission should contribute to the cost thereof as therein set forth. This order was rescinded by order no. 40367, issued on February 16, 1928, which altered the distribution of cost in so far as the contribution from the railway grade crossing fund was concerned, but not otherwise. The distribution of the cost as provided by the said order is stated in the judgment of Mignault J.\u2020 The Toronto Transportation Commission (appellant) was to pay 10% of the cost of the work, after deducting the amount available from the railway grade crossing fund.\nLeave to appeal to this Court was given upon the following questions:\n(1) Had the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada, under the circumstances of this case, jurisdiction under the Railway Act of Canada to provide in Order No. 40367, dated February 16, 1928, that the Toronto Transportation Commission should contribute to the cost of\u2014\n(\u0430) the Bloor Street Subways,\n(b) the Royce Avenue Subway.\nor either of such works referred to in such order.\n(2) If the above question should be answered in the affirmative as to either or both of the said works, had the Parliament of Canada jurisdiction to confer upon the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada authority to compel contribution from the Toronto Transportation Commission, a Provincial corporation, in respect of\u2014\n(\u0430) the Bloor Street Subways,\n(b) the Royce Avenue Subway,\nor either of such works referred to in such order, under the circumstances of this case?\nAs to the Bloor street subways, the appeal was dismissed. As to the Royce avenue subway, the appeal was allowed, Anglin C.J.C. and Smith J. dissenting. Success being divided, no order was made as to costs.\nD. L. McCarthy, K.C., and I. 8. Fairty, K.C., for the appellant.\nE. Lafleur, K.C., for the respondent, Canadian National Railways.\nW. N. Tilley, K.C., for the respondent, the Canadian Pacific Railway Company.\nG. R. Geary, K.C., for the respondent, the City of Toronto.\nThe judgment of Anglin C.J.C. and Smith J. (dissenting in part) was delivered by\nAnglin C.J.C.\u2014The appeal case opens with a comprehensive statement of facts settled by the Board of Railway Commissioners, much of which is historical and, while, no doubt, entirely relevant to the matters which the Board had to consider in exercising the discretion entrusted to it, is scarcely material to the question of its jurisdiction to order the Toronto Transportation Commission to pay a part of the cost of the construction of each of the three subways, two on Bloor Street and the other on Royce Avenue. The facts bearing at all directly on that question lie within a comparatively narrow compass.\nAs in the Main Street case[1], leave to appeal has been granted on two questions, viz.: (a) Does the Railway Act* purport to confer on the Board jurisdiction to make the impugned Order?; (b) If it does, is it, in that respect, intra vires? Bloor Street is a main artery of the city of Toronto, running East and West, which is paralleled by Royce Avenue, about three-quarters of a mile farther north. Both streets are intersected by Dundas Street\u2014itself also an important thoroughfare running northwesterly. On Dundas Street there was a double track street railway line of the Toronto Transportation Commission, which extended along and adjacent to the right of way of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company from a point somewhat farther south to a point northwest of the intersection of Royce Avenue and Dundas Street. On Bloor Street there was also, prior to the making of the subway under consideration, a line of street railway operated by the appellant Commission which terminated at Lansdowne Avenue, about one-half a mile east of Dundas Street.\nThe Transportation Commission has never operated a street railway on Royce Avenue; and it is uncertain when, if ever, such a line will be constructed.\nBetween Lansdowne Avenue and Dundas Street, and adjacently to the latter, Bloor Street is crossed by three important railway lines, two operated by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company and one by the Canadian National Railways System. The \u201csettled statement\u201d of facts, in paragraph 12, says:\nUp to the closing of the street for subway construction no line of street railway existed on that portion of Bloor Street between Lansdowne Avenue and Dundas Street, but passengers on the street railway travelling west along Bloor Street as far as Lansdowne Avenue, who wished to continue west and north, instead of travelling south and transferring at the corner of Lansdowne Avenue and Dundas Street, could obtain transfers and walk along Bloor Street across the steam railway tracks to the intersection of Bloor and Dundas Streets and continue their journey on the street railway from that point, and similar privileges were given to those travelling in the opposite direction.\nProvision had been made by orders of the Railway Committee of the Privy Council and of the Board of Railway Commissioners for the protection by gates and watchmen of the level-crossings both on Bloor Street and on Royce Avenue, which is also crossed by the same lines of steam railway. As part of a general scheme of grade separation in Northwest Toronto, the Railway Board\nacting under its powers for the protection, safety and convenience of the public, issued its Order No. 35037, dated May 9, 1924, approving the general plans submitted by the Canadian Pacific for grade separation in the northwestern section of the city including subways under the tracks of the Canadian Pacific Galt and Toronto, Grey and Bruce Subdivisions and the Canadian National Brampton Subdivision at Bloor Street and Royce Avenue * * * (Paragraph 26).\nIn paragraph 24 of the \u201csettled statement\u201d it is said,\nOne of the reasons requiring protection by grade separation at these crossings was to enable the Transportation Commission to extend its lines of street railway across the tracks so as to give the residents of the northwestern section of the city a better and more continuous street car service. It was also stated that the Transportation Commission would possibly in the future extend its lines of street railway across the tracks of the steam railways at Royce Avenue.\nBy further order No. 35153, the Board, on the 5th of June, 1924, directed that the work on the subways now in question be undertaken, and provided, inter alia, as follows:\nThat all questions of distribution of costs, interest, or other matters involved in the construction of the said work be reserved for further Order of the Board.\nOn the 15th of July, 1925, the Transportation Commission applied to the Board of Railway Commissioners for an order under s. 252 of the Railway Act granting it leave to construct, for the corporation of the City of Toronto, a double track line of street railway, between Dundas Street and Lansdowne Avenue along Bloor Street.\nBy order of the 30th of August, No. 36693, the Board granted this application, again reserving \u201cthe question of contribution to the cost of said subways by the applicant.\u201d\nUnder the authority thus granted, the Transportation Commission constructed its tramway lines along Bloor Street and has since operated such lines through these subways, thus crossing under the steam railways, as is more fully stated in paragraph No. 32 of the \u201csettled statement\u201d.\nPar. 32 of the Statement of Facts reads as follows:\n32. Under the authority so granted to it, the Transportation Commission did, during the course of construction of the subways, construct a double line of street railway tracks along Bloor Street from Lansdowne Avenue to Dundas Street and through the subways constructed pursuant to the Board\u2019s Order and the Transportation. Commission now operates street cars through the said subways. The trolley wires of such street railway are carried through the subways in a wooden trough which is supported by the span cables strung across the subways at intervals and hooked to the top of the steel bents at the centre of the subways and at the sidewalk line. In addition to the trolley wires an insulated feed cable for supplying current to them is carried through the subways, being suspended by oak blocks bolted at intervals to the lower flange of the steel superstructure, and connected at intervals with the trolley wires. A plan illustrating the method of construction is attached hereto * * *. Finally, (paragraph No. 36).\nOn November 15, 1926, the Board issued its formal Order No. 38424, distributing the cost of construction of the said subways, and directing that the Transportation Commission should contribute to the cost thereof as therein set forth,\ni.e., one-tenth thereof, after deducting the amount available from the Railway Grade Crossing Fund.\nFrom this order the present appeal is taken by the Transportation Commission.\nThe jurisdiction of the Board to order the appellant Commission to bear a part of the cost of the subways under consideration, the construction of which was ordered by the Board, as the \u201csettled statement\u201d says, \u201cacting under its powers for the protection, safety and convenience of the public\u201d, depends upon whether the Commission is a company \u201cinterested or affected by (the) order\u201d so made, since s. 39 applies to every such order of the Board, whether s. 259 may or may not also be invoked in support of the disposition here made of the cost. The Queen Street East case[2].\nThat the Transportation Commission was vitally \u201cinterested\u201d in the construction of the Bloor Street subway and was \u201caffected by\u201d the order made therefor is, in our opinion, beyond doubt. It benefits directly because it was thus enabled to substitute a continuous line of railway along Bloor Street, connecting directly with the Dundas Street lines, for the disjecta membra operated before the subway was built and which entailed both inconvenience and danger to its patrons in having to walk about half a mile, involving their crossing on the level three lines of steam railway.\nThe interest of the Commission in the Royce Avenue subway is, perhaps, not so obvious. We, however, are not concerned with the quantum of its interest or with the extent to which it is affected by the order for the construction of that subway. That the Transportation Commission should have had some appreciable interest or that its undertaking should be in some tangible way \u201caffected by\u201d the order, for construction, suffices to give jurisdiction to the Board to require it to contribute to the cost. Whether that jurisdiction should be exercised, in so far as it may depend upon the quantum of interest or affection, it is exclusively for the Board, in its discretion, to determine (s. 44 (3) ). While the Transportation Commission does not now carry, and may never carry, its lines through the Royce Avenue subway, the situs of its tracks on Dundas Street has been so diverted in connection with the construction of that subway, that, whereas formerly traffic coming from Royce Avenue was thrown upon them approximately at a right angle and in a single stream, whether intended to go north or south on Dundas Street, it is now divided and comes up to the tracks not, as formerly, about at right angles, but by two ramps or approaches so constructed that the portion going northerly goes up one ramp and approaches the railway at a very acute angle, while that going southerly ascends by another ramp and also approaches the railway at a very acute angle. That this division and diversion of traffic involves some improvement for the street railway over the conditions theretofore existing, seems altogether probable. While, therefore, if the interest of the Transportation Commission and its being affected by the order for the construction of the Royce Avenue subway depended upon its making use of that subway for its tracks, we might be disposed to say that the case would seem rather to be one for the application of s. 45 of the Railway Act, we find it impossible to hold that it has been shewn that the Transportation Commission has not a present interest, different in kind from that of the ordinary residents in, or users of, the city streets, in the changes effected by the order of the Board in connection with the subway, still less that it is wholly unaffected by an order which provides for the removal of its tracks somewhat to the west and for the construction of the two ramps above referred to, thus dividing the traffic from Royce Avenue so that it will approach the lines of the street railway at angles much more acute than theretofore. While there may be not a little to be said for such an \u201cinterest\u201d and \u201caffection\u201d being too slender to justify the order of the Board requiring the Transportation Commission to bear 10 per cent. of the cost of the Royce Avenue subway, that is rather a question of degree involving the sufficiency in extent of the \u201cinterest\u201d and \u201caffection\u201d, in regard to which the discretion exercised by the Board cannot be interfered with here. The disposition of question (b) is indicated in the judgment in the Main Street case[3].\nWe are, for these reasons, of the opinion that this appeal fails and must be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Mignault and Lamont JJ. was delivered by\nMignault J.\u2014The appellant is the administrative body charged with the operation of the street railways in Toronto, all of which belong to that city. It was incorporated in 1920 by the Ontario Legislature, by chapter 144 of the statutes of that year, on petition of the city corporation, which was empowered to establish by by-law a commission for the operation of the street railways already belonging to it or to be taken over by it from the Toronto Railway Company. This commission has the control, maintenance, operation and management of these railways, and it is authorized in particular to construct, operate and manage new lines of street railway in addition to or in extension of existing lines; to fix such tolls and fares so as to render its system self-sustaining; and to make requisitions upon the council for all sums of money necessary to carry out its powers. It reports yearly to the council with a complete audited and certified financial statement of its affairs. In a rather restricted sense, the commission, when constituted, may perhaps be said to be the agent, with very wide powers, of the city corporation for the operation of the street railways, the title to which is in the city. The policy apparent by the terms of the statute is to entrust the control and management of these street railways to this commission, which is itself a body corporate, and which is to so operate them as to render the railways self-supporting.\nThe respondents are two Dominion railway companies, subject to the statutes incorporating them and to the Dominion Railway Act, 1919, and also the corporation of the City of Toronto.\nLeave to appeal from an order of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada, hereinafter called the Board, was obtained by the appellant from a judge of this Court. Before stating the questions raised under this appeal, it will be convenient to summarize as briefly as possible the facts which have been agreed upon by the parties.\nBloor Street is an original concession road extending in an east and west direction through the northwest section of Toronto, and Royce Avenue is parallel to, and about three-quarters of a mile north of, Bloor Street. Dundas Street is an old established highway extending in a northwesterly direction through Toronto. It crosses Bloor Street, and, at a point just north of Royce Avenue, veers to the west. It is one of the main arteries over which traffic from the districts north and west of Toronto enters the city.\nBloor Street, at a point a short distance east of its intersection with Dundas Street, is crossed by three lines of steam railways side by side, to wit, the Galt subdivision of the Canadian Pacific, the Brampton subdivision of the Canadian National, and the Toronto, Grey and Bruce subdivision of the Canadian Pacific. These lines run parallel to each other in a northwesterly direction, and before the construction of the subways here in question crossed Bloor Street and also Royce Avenue on the level. They are parallel to (but do not cross) Dundas Street, for a distance of approximately 1,783 feet, to a point immediately north of Royce Avenue where, as stated, Dundas Street veers to the west.\nBloor Street is also crossed, some 1,200 feet east of these three lines of steam railways, by the Newmarket subdivision of the Canadian National extending in a northerly direction. Prior to the construction of a subway here, this crossing was on the level.\nThe Toronto street railways were originally operated in part by the Toronto Railway Company and in part by the city corporation, and for a number of years prior to 1920 included in this locality lines extending from the centre of the city. Along Bloor Street the street railway ran from the east to the corner of Lansdowne Avenue, a north and south highway, being at that point about half a mile east of the intersection of Dundas Street with Bloor Street, and also a short distance east of the crossing of the Newmarket subdivision. Dundas Street interects Lansdowne Avenue at a point which appears by the map to be a little more than a half-mile south of Bloor Street. West of the three steam railways above described, and west of Dundas Street at its intersection with Bloor Street, there had been for a number of years a line of street railway on Bloor Street. There were also, and still are, street railways on Lansdowne Avenue and on Dundas Street. Street railway passengers going towards the west along Bloor Street were provided, for the same fare, with transfers allowing them to take the cars running south on Lansdowne Avenue, thence the cars going northwest on Dundas Street, and they then transferred to the Bloor Street line running west. This process was reversed for passengers going from the west to the east on Bloor Street. Or they could disembark at Lansdowne Avenue, walk along Bloor Street, cross all the steam railways, and at Dundas Street continue their journey with their transfers by the Bloor Street cars, or reverse the process. There was then, as is apparent from what I have just said, no street railway on Bloor Street, between Lansdowne Avenue and Dundas Street, crossing the four lines of steam railways.\nPursuant to the Act incorporating the appellant, the city corporation, in 1921, acquired the property of the Toronto Railway Company, and entrusted the operation and management of the latter\u2019s lines of street railways, and also of the street railways theretofore operated by the city, to the appellant, which has since operated them.\nBy order of the Railway Committee of the Privy Council, dated January 8, 1891, gates and watchmen were installed for the protection of the public at the crossing on Bloor Street of the three steam railways above described. An order of the Board (which succeeded the Railway Committee of the Privy Council) of May 18, 1908, No. 4795, provided for the protection by gates and watchmen of the crossing on Bloor street of the Newmarket subdivision of the Canadian National (then the Grand Trunk), and by a further order of the Board of May 23, 1910, No. 10782, a similar provision was made for the protection of the crossing of Royce Avenue by the three steam railways above described. This protection of all these crossings was maintained until the level crossings were closed for the purpose of subway construction under the scheme authorized by the Board known as the Northwest Grade Separation. On November 21, 1922, the city corporation applied to the Board for an order requiring the Canadian National to collaborate with the city in the preparation of a joint plan for the separation of grades on, among other streets, Bloor Street and Royce Avenue, and this application was heard and plans submitted by the railways at several hearings by the Board in Toronto. Finally a further hearing was held by the Board on February 19, 1924, of which the appellant received notice and at which it was represented. Among other proposals submitted, one by the Canadian Pacific provided for the diversion of Dundas Street on a tangent in the vicinity of the crossing of the railways on Royce Avenue, and this is the diversion which is an important feature of the case. On May 9, 1924, by order 35037, the Board approved the general plans submitted for grade separation in the northwest section of the city, including subways on Bloor Street under the three lines of railway above described and under the Newmarket subdivision of the Canadian National. It sanctioned also a subway on Royce Avenue, involving the acquisition of additional land and the construction of the diversion of Dundas Street. This diversion, as shown by the plan, extends from the intersection of Humberside Avenue with Dundas Street in a northwesterly direction to the intersection of Indian Road with the same street, a distance, as I measure it, according to the scale of the plan, of approximately 1,000 feet.\nOn June 5, 1924, the Board issued an order, No. 35153, directing the construction of the works, and this order provided that all questions of distribution of cost, interest or other matters involved in the construction be reserved for further order of the Board. This order was subsequently amended on July 10, 1924, by order of the Board No. 35308.\nWe next have an application to the Board by the appellant, dated July 15, 1925, for an order under section 252 of the Railway Act granting it leave to construct for the corporation of the city a double track of street railway between Dundas Street and Lansdowne Avenue on Bloor Street and through the subways on that street. The Board granted this application by order No. 36693, of August 13, 1925, and reserved for further consideration the question of contribution by the applicant to the cost of the subways. The appellant under this authority constructed a double line of street railway tracks along Bloor Street through the subways, between the two points above indicated, on which it now operates its cars. A full description of this construction through the Bloor Street subways is contained in paragraph 32 of the statement of factsa. No street cars are operated by the appellant through the subway at Royce Avenue, nor are there any lines of street railway on that avenue.\nAn order of the Board, No. 36737, of August 22, 1925, authorized the Canadian Pacific and the Canadian National to use and operate the subway carrying their tracks, to wit, the three railways above described, over Bloor Street, and a similar order, No. 36738, dated August 21, 1925, gave leave to the Canadian National to use and operate the subway carrying the tracks of its Newmarket subdivision over Bloor Street. There was also a like order of the Board, No. 37239, bearing date January 15, 1926, authorizing the Canadian Pacific and the Canadian National to make use of the subway carrying their tracks over Royce Avenue.\nAfter all this was done, the Board, on November 15, 1926, issued a formal order, No. 38424, distributing the cost of construction of the subways. This order was rescinded by the Board on February 16, 1928, by its order of that date, No. 40367, which altered the distribution of cost in so far as the contribution from the railway grade crossing fund was concerned, but not otherwise. It is from order No. 40367 that this appeal is asserted.\nIt will be convenient to state here how the cost of construction of the subways was distributed by the order just mentioned. The order is concerned with three subways, two on Bloor Street, and one on Royce Avenue.\nSubways on Bloor Street. Forty per cent. of the annual expenditure, commencing in 1924 and not exceeding in any one year $75,000, in connection with the crossings under the tracks of the three railways above described, and 40 per cent. of the annual expenditure, commencing in the same year, and not exceeding in any one year $25,000, in connection with the crossing under the tracks of the Newmarket subdivision of the Canadian National,\u2014to be paid out of the railway grade crossing fund.\nSubway on Royce Avenue. To be paid out of the same fund, 40 per cent. of the annual expenditure, commencing in the same year, and not exceeding in any one year $75,000, in connection with the crossing under the tracks of the three railways above described.\nThe order provides that the Bell Telephone Co., the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario, the Toronto Hydro-Electric System, and the Consumers\u2019 Gas Company shall bear and pay the cost of any changes in their plant necessitated by changes in the streets. These public utilities do not otherwise contribute to the cost of the subways.\nIt is then ordered that the appellant shall pay 10 per cent. of the cost of the work (which obviously includes the three subways and incidental expenses), after deducting the amount available from the railway grade crossing fund.\nThe rest of the expenditure is to be borne as follows:\u2014As to the crossings of Bloor Street and Royce Avenue by the three railways above described, 50 per cent. by these railways and 50 per cent. by the City of Toronto; and as to the crossing of Bloor Street by the Newmarket subdivision of the Canadian National, 50 per cent. by that railway and 50 per cent. by the City of Toronto.\nLeave to appeal from this order of the Board was given upon the two following questions:\u2014\n(1) Had the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada, under the circumstances of this case, jurisdiction under the Railway Act of Canada to provide in Order No. 40367, dated February 16, 1928, that the Toronto Transportation Commission should contribute to the cost of\u2014\n(\u0430) the Bloor Street Subways,\n(b) the Royce Avenue Subway,\nor either of such works referred to in such order.\n(2) If the above question be answered in the affirmative as to either or both of the said works, had the Parliament of Canada jurisdiction to confer upon the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada authority to compel contribution from the Toronto Transportation Commission, a Provincial corporation, in respect of\u2014\n(a) the Bloor Street Subways,\n(b) the Royce Avenue Subway,\nor either of such works referred to in such order, under the circumstances of this case? In dealing with the jurisdiction of the Board to order that the appellant should contribute to the cost of these subways, it is important to note that no question is raised here as to its power to direct the construction of the works themselves, the controversy being narrowed down to the point whether the appellant could be called upon to contribute to their cost. The application to the Board of the city corporation (November 21, 1922) was made under section 257 of the Railway Act. It must therefore be taken as granted that in ordering these works the Board acted within the ample powers which that section confers on it for \u201cthe protection, safety and convenience of the public Having exercised a power vested in it, the Board could, under section 39, subsection 1, of the Railway Act, order \u201cby what company, municipality or person, interested or affected by such order\u201d (the order directing or permitting the works) the works should be constructed, and, under subsection 2 of the same section, \u201cby whom, in what proportion, and when\u201d the cost and expenses involved should be paid. It is now settled that the words \u201cby whom\u201d in subsection 2, \u201cmust be read with reference to the immediately preceding provision and that an order directing payment or contribution \u201cmay be made only on a company, municipality or person interested in or affected by the order directing the works\u201d (Toronto Railway Co. v. City of Toronto[4]).\nThe question is therefore whether this appellant is a company or person \u201cinterested in or affected by the order directing the works\u201d. This enquiry is open to us on this proceeding, for it is the basis of the jurisdiction asserted by the Board. Some reference was made to subsection 5 of section 33, but it is restricted by its terms to that section. In a case like this one, the finding of the Board that a company or person is interested in or affected by the order directing the works, may certainly be reviewed by this Court on an appeal from the order distributing the cost.\nThis, of course, should not be lightly done, and therefore I am not disposed to disturb the finding of the Board that the appellant was interested in the construction of the two subways of Bloor Street. It is true that the appellant\u2019s lines on that street had never crossed the railways, but by reason of the construction of the subways it was enabled to establish a continuous line of street railway along Bloor Street. Its passengers were no longer obliged to follow the circuitous route I have described, or to run the risk of crossing four lines of steam railway on foot. Although it was so suggested to us, I do not regard the order requiring the appellant to contribute to the cost of construction as a term of the unconditional authorization it had previously obtained to extend its lines through the subways. The soil of the subways is a public highway of the city. It would not have been within reason for the Board to refuse to allow the appellant to construct its lines of street railway through the subway, subject to such protective measures as might be prescribed for the preservation of the structure or the safety of the public. So I would be very slow to construe the subsequent order to contribute as a term of the authorization which the Board granted to the appellant. However no such argument is necessary to support the order of contribution in respect of the Bloor Street subways.\nBut the appellant cannot be said to have been interested in or affected by the construction of the Royce Avenue subway. Its tracks merely ran, and still run, along Dundas Street, which for some distance parallels the three lines of steam railways, but they never came into contact therewith. The appellant does not use the subway, nor has it any line on Royce Avenue. And as to the diversion on Dundas Street which it now uses, it suffices to say that this diversion was decided upon to afford an easy approach to the subway. Not being interested in the latter, the appellant cannot be said to have an interest in the diversion, which was, moreover, the cause of additional expense to it, for it became necessary to lay new tracks along the diverted road.* It may be further added that the ten per cent. contribution exacted from the appellant takes no account of the cost of the diversion as distinguished from the cost of the subway, the contribution being to the whole expenditure. My conclusion is that the order of contribution to the cost of the Royce Avenue subway and the diversion cannot be supported.\nThe respondents referred us to section 259 of the Railway Act which reads as follows:\n259. Notwithstanding anything in this Act, or in any other Act, the Board may, subject to the provisions of the next following section of this Act, order what portion, if any, of cost is to be borne respectively by the company, municipal or other corporation, or person in respect of any order made by the Board, under any of the last three preceding sections, and such order shall be binding on and enforcible against any railway company, municipal or other corporation or person named in such order.\nIt is to be observed, however, that section 259 is to the same effect as section 238, subsection 3, introduced into the Railway Act as enacted by R.S.C., c. 37, by 8 & 9 Edw. VII, c. 32 (1909). Subsection 3 was considered by their Lordships of the Judicial Committee in Toronto Ry. Co. v. Toronto[5], and they stated that there was \u201cnothing in it to put an end to the application of section 59 (now section 39) to orders under ss. 237 and 238\u201d (now, as far as material here, sections 256 and 257 of the Railway Act, 1919, the third subsection of section 238 of the former Act being section 259 of the present Act).\nThe appellant contended that in operating the street railways, it was a mere agent of the city corporation, and that for this reason it could not be called upon to contribute to the cost of any of these subways. I think it suffices to say that, whatever may be its rights and remedies against the city corporation, the appellant, as an operating corporation in control of the street railways, and entrusted with their full management, could be treated by the Board as a company or person to which section 39 of the Railway Act applies, subject, of course, to its interest being shewn.\nI would therefore answer question (1) in the affirmative as to the Bloor Street subways, and in the negative as to the Royce Avenue subway.\nBy its terms question (2) requires an answer merely with respect to the Bloor Street subways. I think this answer must be in the affirmative. It is now settled that in such a matter the jurisdiction of Parliament cannot be questioned. Toronto v. Canadian Pacific Ry. Co.[6]; Toronto Railway Co. v. Toronto (the Avenue Road case)[7].\nI would allow the appeal as to the Royce Avenue subway, and dismiss it in respect of the Bloor Street subways. Success being divided, I would make no order as to costs.\nNewcombe J.\u2014I agree in the conclusions of my brother Mignault with respect to these subways. It is said that the appellant Commission derives a benefit from the method provided for the approach or discharge of traffic from and to the subway as between Dundas Street and Royce Avenue. It may be so; but there is no finding to that effect, and I see no reason to believe that the Commissioners intended to impose a percentage of the cost of the subway on Royce Avenue as compensation for advantages said to accrue by reason of the diversion of Dundas Street. If, on the contrary, as the case seems to suggest, the Board was anticipating value which might be realized when, if ever, a branch of the tramway is constructed upon the subway, I do not think that the Board would have jurisdiction to order payment under s. 39 of the Railway Act. It cannot be said that a person is interested merely because, in the future, he may become so; and that, as I understand the case, is the position of the appellant with respect to Royce Avenue.\nAppeal dismissed as to Bloor Street case.

In 1919 the City applied to the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada for an order requiring the railway company to construct a new bridge, the old bridge, though sufficiently strong, being then too narrow to accommodate the traffic. By order of July 3, 1920, the Board directed construction of a new bridge at the sole cost of the railway company. Up to that time no street railway had crossed said tracks, but the approved plans of the new bridge were so drawn that it would have sufficient strength to carry street railway traffic. Appellant took over the operation of the street railways of the city in 1921. It built a line crossing over the new bridge, completing it in July, 1922, and, the Board having held that such crossing was within the prohibition of s. 252 of the Dominion Railway Act, the appellant (on application made without prejudice to its claim that leave of the Board was unnecessary) obtained, in October, 1922, temporary permission so to cross. The railway company had, in June, 1922, applied for an order requiring appellant to contribute to the cost of the bridge and for re-opening of the whole question of cost, alleging mistake of the Board as to the facts when making its order of July 3, 1920; and said permission to appellant to cross was expressly made \u201cpending decision of the Board\u201d upon those matters. Since that time appellant has continuously operated its cars over the bridge. In 1926 the Board granted the railway company\u2019s application (on said grounds alleged) for reconsideration of the order of July 3, 1920, and in January, 1928, made an amending order requiring certain contributions from the City and from appellant. From this order appellant appealed on the ground of want of jurisdiction. Held (Mignault J. dissenting): The order in appeal was within the Board\u2019s jurisdiction under the Railway Act, whether viewed as an exercise of its powers under ss. 257 and 259 upon an application for permission to cross under s. 252 made by appellant, or viewed merely as a case in which the Board was \u201creviewing\u201d and \u201caltering or varying\u201d (s. 51) its former order as to payment of the cost of the bridge. S. 39 applied to the order for construction of the bridge (Toronto Ry. Co. v. Toronto, [1920] A.C. 426, at pp. 435, 6, 437-8); appellant was a company \u201cinterested or affected by\u201d that order within the meaning of s. 39 (1), and it was within the Board\u2019s jurisdiction under s. 39 (2) to determine by whom, and in what proportions the cost should be borne. (The Vancouver case, [1914] A.C. 1067, distinguished). The order for contribution complained of could have been made when the order for construction was made in 1920, had the present circumstances then existed, and ss. 37 and 51 enabled it to be made in 1928. The Board having jurisdiction, the mode of its exercise and the consequent burdens imposed were not matters open for consideration in this Court (s. 44 (3)).\nPer Mignault J., dissenting: The Board had not jurisdiction under the Act to make the order complained of. A mere benefit to be derived by appellant from the reconstruction of the bridge would not give such jurisdiction (the existence of such a benefit would not constitute an interest within the meaning of s. 39). An application under s. 252 for permission to cross a Dominion railway does not by itself confer jurisdiction to make the applicant contribute; so the appellant\u2019s application for leave to lay its tracks on the widened bridge could not be relied on as a foundation for the jurisdiction. The facts did not come within the language of s. 257; there was no railway \u201calready constructed upon, along or across any highway\u201d (under the 1884 agreement the highway was carried ever the railway by the bridge which was part of the highway); the order for reconstruction was not made for \u201cthe protection, safety and convenience of the public\u201d (any danger to the public had been eliminated by the existing bridge). The application for reconstruction was \u201ca matter between the corporation and the railway company alone,\u201d that is to say, between the parties to the agreement of 1884. The matter was \u201cone merely of street improvement\u201d (Reasons in the Vancouver case, [1914] A.C. 1067, as explained in the Toronto case, [1920] A.C. 426, applied).\nHeld, also, that the Parliament of Canada had jurisdiction to confer upon the Board the authority to compel contribution from the appellant, a provincial corporation, under the circumstances of the case.\nAPPEAL (by leave given as hereinafter mentioned; and upon a settled statement of facts) by the Toronto Transportation Commission (a corporation established under c. 144 of the Ontario statutes of 1920, and being the administrative body charged with the operation of the street railways in the city of Toronto, all of which belong to the City) from an order of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada directing that the appellant pay ten per cent. of the cost of a bridge over the tracks of the respondent, Canadian National Railways, on Main street, in the city of Toronto. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgments now reported, and are indicated in the above headnote. Leave to appeal was given by the Board on the following question:\n\u201cHad the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada, under the circumstances of this case, jurisdiction under the Railway Act (Canada) to provide in order No. 40120, dated January 3, 1928, that the Toronto Transportation Commission should contribute to the cost of the work referred to in such order?\u201d\nand leave to appeal was given by Mignault J. on the following further question\n\u201cShould the answer to the question submitted by leave of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada be in the affirmative, had the Parliament of Canada jurisdiction to confer upon the said Board authority to compel contribution from the Toronto Transportation Commission, a provincial corporation, towards the cost of the above described work under the circumstances of this case?\u201d\nThe appeal was dismissed with costs, Mignault J. dissenting.\nD.

Geary, K.C., for the respondent, the City of Toronto.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C. and Newcombe, Lamont and Smith JJ.) was delivered by\nAnglin C.J.C.\u2014The question before us is whether the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada had jurisdiction to require the appellant Transportation Commission to contribute one-tenth of the cost of a bridge which crosses Main Street over the tracks of the respondent Railway System at a point in the eastern part of the City of Toronto. By an order of a judge of this Court, giving leave to appeal, two questions are propounded:\n(1) Whether the Railway Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 170,* purports to confer such jurisdiction;\n(2) Whether, if it does so, that legislation is intra vires of the Parliament of Canada?\nThe material facts may be stated as follows:\nDawes Road formerly crossed on the level the tracks of the Grand Trunk Railway Company, a predecessor of the present Canadian National Railways System. In 1884, by an agreement between the Railway Company and the Township of York, in which the situs was at that time, Dawes Road was closed and the portion thereof lying between the lines of its right of way projected was conveyed to the Grand Trunk Railway Co., the present Main Street, which crosses the railway tracks at right angles, being substituted therefor; and the railway company then undertook at its own expense to erect and maintain a bridge to carry the new highway over its tracks.\nIn 1919, the area in question having in the interval been annexed to the city, the City of Toronto applied to the Board for an order requiring the Grand Trunk Railway Co. to construct a new bridge at Main Street; although the bridge theretofore in use was sufficiently strong, it was then too narrow to accommodate the traffic using it.\nOn July 3, 1920, by order No. 29923, the Board directed the construction of the new bridge, at the sole cost of the Railway Company; and plans for this bridge were subsequently approved by the Board.\nAlthough, up to this time, no street railway had crossed the tracks of the G.T.R. at Main Street, the plans and specifications of the new bridge were, at the instance of the City, so drawn that it would have sufficient strength to carry street railway traffic, to provide for which, as the Chief Commissioner points out, it was then contemplated might be necessary. This involved additional outlay.\nThe appellant corporation took over the operation of the street railways of the City of Toronto in September, 1921. It found two unconnected street railway lines existing, one on Danforth Avenue and the other on Gerrard Street; and, in, or prior to June, 1922, it determined to build a line on Main Street, to be carried over the new bridge, for the purpose of connecting those two existing lines. The new tracks over the bridge were completed about the 15th of July, 1922. Meantime, the Grand Trunk Railway Co. had applied to the Board, on the 19th of June, for a declaration that the Board\u2019s consent for the crossing of its tracks by the street railway system had not been had and for an order requiring the appellant to pay a share of the cost of the bridge, and, on the 22nd of June, for an order to permit the re-opening of the whole question of cost of the bridge, alleging that there had been mistake as to the facts, on the part of the Board, when making its former order No. 29923, imposing such cost wholly on the Railway Company.\nUpholding the contention of the Railway Company that the case fell within the prohibition of s. 252 of the Railway Act and that the approval of the Board must be obtained before the intended crossing could be made, the Board suggested that the Transportation Commission should seek a temporary permission to cross with its street cars. Such application having been made by that Commission, the Board, by order No. 32956, made on the 10th of October, 1922, granted it permission to use the Main Street bridge to cross the Grand Trunk tracks\ntemporarily, and pending decision of the Board upon all matters involved in the application of the Railway Company herein that the Board review the question of the allocation of the cost of the bridge.\nSince that time the appellant has continuously operated its street cars over the bridge.\nBy subsequent order No. 37366, made on the 4th of March, 1926, the Board granted the application of the Grand Trunk Railway Co. for a reconsideration of order No. 29923 of the 3rd of July, 1920, dealing with the cost of the Main Street bridge, holding that it had been shewn that that order had been made under a misapprehension of then existing facts; and, by order No. 40120, made on the 3rd of January, 1928, the Board directed that order No. 29923 be amended so as to provide that the cost of reconstructing the bridge over the tracks of the Canadian National Railways at Main Street shall be borne and paid \u201c60 per cent. by the applicants, 30 per cent. by the City of Toronto and 10 per cent. by the Toronto Transportation Commission\u201d. It is from this latter order that the present appeal is taken by the Transportation Commission.\nSection 39 of the Railway Act reads as follows:\n39. When the Board, in the exercise of any power vested in it, in and by any order directs or permits any structure, appliances, equipment, works, renewals, or repairs to be provided, constructed, reconstructed, altered, installed, operated, used or maintained, it may, except as otherwise expressly provided, order by what company, municipality or person, interested or affected by such order, as the case may be, and when or within what time and upon what terms and conditions as to the payment of compensation or otherwise, and under what supervision, the same shall be provided, constructed, reconstructed, altered, installed, operated, used and maintained.\n2. The Board may, except as otherwise expressly provided, order by whom, in what proportion, and when, the cost and expenses of providing, constructing, reconstructing, altering, installing, and executing such structures, equipment, works, renewals, or repairs, or of the supervision, if any, of the continued operation, use or maintenance thereof, or of otherwise complying with such order, shall be paid.\nBy s. 51 the Board is empowered to \u201creview, rescind, change, alter or vary any order or decision made by it * * *.\u201d With respect to any matter already dealt with by it, this section enables the Board to make any order in review which it might have made were such matter res integra. No doubt this power should be exercised sparingly and circumspectly, as the Chief Commissioner\u2019s judgment shews he realized. But whether circumstances exist which justify its use must be a matter almost exclusively within the Board\u2019s discretion. It is difficult to appreciate how the exercise of this power in an order otherwise unexceptionable can per se give rise to a question of jurisdiction.\nSection 252 prohibits the railway lines or tracks of any railway company (s. 2 (21) ) being carried across any railway lines or tracks other than those of such company unless leave therefor has been obtained from the Board.\nSection 257 empowers the Board, in cases of existing crossings, to make stipulations \u201cas to the protection, safety and convenience of the public as it deems expedient * * *.\u201d\nSection 259 is as follows:\n259. Notwithstanding anything in this Act, or in any other Act, the Board may, subject to the provisions of the next following section of this Act, order what portion, if any, of cost is to be borne respectively by the company, municipal or other corporation, or person in respect of any order made by the Board, under any of the last three preceding sections, and such order shall be binding on and enforcible against any railway company, municipal or other corporation or person named in such order. Whether the order against which this appeal is taken be viewed as an exercise by the Board of the powers conferred by ss. 257 and 259 upon an application for permission to cross under s. 252 made by the appellants, or whether it should be viewed merely as a case in which the Board is \u201creviewing * * * and altering or varying\u201d (s. 51) an order or decision already made by it in regard to the payment of the cost of the bridge in question, its jurisdiction to make the order now in appeal seems to us to be indubitable.\nThe appellant Transportation Commission was, in our opinion, clearly a company \u201cinterested or affected by\u201d the order for the construction of the new bridge within the meaning of subs. 1 of s. 39. That section applies to such an order (Toronto Ry. Co. v. Toronto[1]), and, therefore, it was within the jurisdiction of the Board under subs. 2 thereof to determine by whom, and in what proportions, the cost and expense of the construction thereby directed should be borne. That the appellant is not a company \u201cinterested or affected by\u201d order No. 29923 is scarcely arguable. If the present circumstances had existed in 1920, the Board might have made order No. 40120 when making order No. 29923. Sections 37 and 51 enabled it to make order No. 40120 in 1928.\nIn the Vancouver case[2], the order of the Board was not made under s. 39 (then s. 59) and did not come within its provisions (p. 1075), as Lord Finlay points out in the Toronto case[3]. The order made in the case at bar was, as was held in regard to that before the Judicial Committee in the case last cited,\nin substance mandatory and (was) made for the convenience and protection of the public with regard to the crossing of the railways. What was done may have improved the street, but it was certainly not a mere matter of street improvement.\nWhether the circumstances justified the discretion exercised by the Board in apportioning the cost of the bridge as it did is a matter with which we are not concerned, the only question before us being that of jurisdiction. If, as we find, the Board is given jurisdiction in the premises, the mode of its exercise of such jurisdiction and the consequent burdens imposed are not matters open for consideration here. (s. 44(3)).\nThis disposes of the first question submitted, dependent for its solution on the construction of the relevant railway legislation.\nOn the other question:\u2014Of the constitutional validity of the railway legislation under discussion, there is, in our opinion, not the slightest doubt. Toronto Ry. Co. v. Toronto[4].\nThe appeal fails and must be dismissed with costs.\nMignault J. (dissenting).\u2014This is an appeal by leave partly of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada, hereinafter called the Board, and partly of a judge of this Court, from an order of the Board of January 3, 1928, No. 40120, directing that the appellant pay 10 per cent. of the cost of a bridge over the tracks of the Canadian National Railways at Main Street in the city of Toronto. It was argued at the same time as the appeal of this appellant in the case of the Bloor Street and Royce Avenue subways[5], and the statement of facts in the latter case will be here supplemented in so far only as the present case differs from the other one.\nThe respondent, Canadian National Railways, is the successor of the Grand Trunk Ry. Company of Canada. Prior to 1884, a public highway, Dawes Road, crossed on the level the tracks of the Grand Trunk from southwest to northeast, at a pronounced angle. By an agreement of June 25, 1884, between the Corporation of the Township of York, where this crossing then lay, and the Grand Trunk, Dawes Road was closed up and conveyed to the Railway, and a new highway opened, now Main Street, crossing the railway at right angles by means of a bridge which the Grand Trunk agreed to build and keep in repair at its own expense.\nThe district was then a suburban one, but it has since been annexed to the city of Toronto, and its population has very notably increased. In 1914 the City of Toronto made an application to the Board for authority to construct a subway under the tracks of the Grand Trunk at Main Street, The application remained in abeyance during the war, and in 1919 the City applied to the Board for the reconstruction of the bridge. This bridge was physically strong enough for any traffic offering, but it was inadequate in width for such traffic. On June 17, 1920, the Board delivered judgment ordering the construction of the new bridge at the sole cost of the Railway. Pursuant to this judgment, on July 3, 1920, the Board issued its order, No. 29923, requiring the Railway to construct before September 30, 1921, a bridge with a 46 foot roadway, and with ten foot sidewalks on each side. Plans for the bridge were approved by the Board and the bridge was completed and opened for traffic on December 1, 1921.\nThe appellant, the character and functions of which were described in the other case[6], was constituted on August 3, 1920, but did not assume the management of the Toronto street railways until September 1, 1921. The city had street railway lines on Danforth Avenue and Gerrard street, and in June, 1922, the appellant decided to connect these lines with a line on Main Street running over the new bridge.\nIt accordingly commenced to lay tracks on Main Street, which tracks were practically completed on July 15, 1922. Permission for the crossing had not been obtained from the Board, land on June 19, 1922, the Grand Trunk applied to the Board for an order declaring that the Board\u2019s consent for the crossing had not been obtained, and for an order that the appellant pay a share of the cost of the bridge, and on June 26, 1922, for an order re-opening the whole question of cost upon the ground that the Board, in its former judgment, had been in error on the facts.\nIt should be mentioned here that when the Board ordered the construction of the new bridge at the sole expense of the Railway, it had declined to follow the decision of the House of Lords in Sharpness New Docks v. Attorney General[7], and had applied instead a principle it had laid down in a previous case (City of Hamilton v. Canadian Pacific et al[8]), expressed as follows:\nWhen a railway company excavates and cuts away a portion of a highway, they should be compelled to replace that highway by a substructure capable of carrying everything which the earth itself as it then existed would carry. When the application of the railway company asking that the appellant be ordered to pay a share of the cost of the bridge came before the Board, the appellant took the ground that the Board\u2019s approval for the crossing was unnecessary, but the Board ruled against this contention, and suggested that the appellant might apply, without prejudice, for a temporary permission to cross with its cars. This application was made and the Board, by order 32956, permitted the appellant,\ntemporarily, and pending decision of the Board upon all matters involved in the application of the Railway Company herein that the Board review the question of the allocation of the cost of the bridge,\nto cross the railway upon the highway known as Main Street. Since then the appellant has operated its cars over the new bridge.\nBy order No. 37366 of March 4, 1926, the Board reopened the question of the cost of the bridge upon the ground that it had proceeded in error in assuming that the facts of the case brought it within the principle of City of Hamilton v. Canadian Pacific (1) above referred to.\nFinally the order appealed from, No. 40120, of January 3, 1928, distributed the cost of the bridge as follows: 60 per cent. to be paid by the Canadian National, 30 per cent. by the City of Toronto, and 10 per cent. by the present appellant.\nBy order No. 41782, of November 21, 1928, the Board gave to the appellant leave to appeal to this Court from the order just mentioned on the following question:\n\u201cHad the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada, under the circumstances of this case, jurisdiction under the Railway Act (Canada) to provide in order No. 40120, dated January 3, 1928, that the Toronto Transportation Commission should contribute to the cost of the work referred to in such order?\u201d\nLeave to appeal was granted by me to the appellant on the further question expressed as follows:\n\u201cShould the answer to the question submitted by leave of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada be in the affirmative, had the Parliament of Canada jurisdiction to confer upon the said Board authority to compel contribution from the Toronto Transportation Commission, a provincial corporation, towards the cost of the above described work under the circumstances of this case?\u201d\nA preliminary point must be disposed of before discussing the merits of the appeal. Could the Board, after having ordered that the Grand Trunk should construct the new bridge, which, the statement of facts admits, involved its construction \u201cat the sole cost and expense of the Railway\u201d, re-open the question of cost and order the appellant to pay ten per cent. of the expenditure?\nSection 51 of the Railway Act enacts that\nthe Board may review, rescind, change, alter or vary any order or decision made by it, or may rehear any application before deciding it.\nThis language seems wide enough to allow the Board to alter or vary its decision. Of course, as observed by Mr. Commissioner Boyce, the power to re-open or review any matter already passed upon should not be exercised unless there is clearly a doubt in the mind of the Board as to the correctness of the former decision, or there be submitted new facts not before the Board at the time the decision was made, or unless the conditions have changed. But this does not go to the jurisdiction of the Board, which is the only point with which we are concerned. And I think section 51 permitted the Board to alter its previous decision, if it had jurisdiction otherwise to make the order complained of.\nThere is, however, a much more serious point which did not arise in the other case[9] where it was obvious that in replacing the level crossings by subways, the Board had acted under section 257 of the Railway Act for \u201cthe protection, safety and convenience of the public.\u201d\nThe question involved is whether under the circumstances there was jurisdiction in the Board to order the appellant to contribute to the cost of the widened bridge. This requires consideration of two judgments of the Judicial Committee:\u2014British Columbia Electric Ry. Co. v. Vancouver, Victoria and Eastern Ry. and Navigation Co.[10], (hereinafter called the Vancouver case), and Toronto Railway Co. v. Toronto[11], (hereinafter called the Toronto case). The binding effect of the former decision must be taken to be that stated by their Lordships in the latter case, pp. 440 and following.\nThere was, however, a deliberate pronouncement by the Privy Council in the Vancouver case[12], as to the jurisdiction of the Board, which was not dissented from by their Lordships in the Toronto case[13]. Speaking of the order under review in the former case, Lord Moulton said (p. 1075):\u2014\nThe fundamental error underlying the decision of the Railway Board is that they have considered that the fact that the tramway company would be benefited by the works gave them jurisdiction to make them pay the cost or a portion of it. There is nothing in the Railway Act which gives any such jurisdiction.\nWe must therefore take it that a mere benefit to be derived by a body in the position of this appellant from the reconstruction of the widened bridge would not give the Board jurisdiction to order it to pay a portion of the cost. In other words, the existence of such a benefit would not constitute an interest within the meaning of section 39 of the Railway Act. The jurisdiction of the Board to order that a person or corporation contribute to the cost of a construction must exist independently of any benefit which that person or corporation may derive from the construction contemplated.\nIt should also be noted that in the Toronto case13 the purport of the decision in the Vancouver case12 was thus stated by Lord Finlay (p. 442):\u2014\nThe judgment (in the Vancouver case12) proceeds on the principle that the assent of the Board was asked merely because the viaduct would cross the Dominion railway, and that this gave no jurisdiction to make the Electric Company pay the costs of construction. (The italics are mine.)\nThis must mean that an application under section 252 of the Railway Act for permission to cross a Dominion railway does not by itself confer jurisdiction on the Board to make the applicant contribute to the cost of the construction. So the application by the appellant for leave to lay its tracks on the widened bridge\u2014and this application was made under reserve of all its rights\u2014cannot be relied on as a foundation for the jurisdiction which the Board has assumed in ordering the appellant to pay a portion of these costs. Section 257 of the Railway Act must now be considered. It is predicated on the assumption that a railway \u201cis already constructed upon, along or across any highway\u201d. The facts here do not come within this language, nor can it be said that the order with which we are concerned was made for \u201cthe protection, safety and convenience of the public\u201d, as contemplated by section 257. The railway in question was not constructed upon or across the highway. Since 1884, under an agreement with the municipality, the highway was carried over the railway by means of a bridge which the Grand Trunk undertook to build and maintain at its own expense, and which was a part of the highway. At the date of the order this bridge was in every way of sufficient strength for any traffic offering, but to accommodate an increase of traffic occasioned by an increase in population, a much wider bridge was considered necessary.\nIt follows therefore, to use Lord Moulton\u2019s language, quoted in the Toronto case[14], \u201cthat the application was a matter between the corporation and the railway company alone\u201d, that is to say between the parties to the agreement of 1884, and this, as Lord Finlay said, was \u201cthe keynote\u201d of the judgment in the Vancouver case[15]. It is pertinent to add that the matter was so considered when the Board made its first order for the reconstruction of the bridge. Certainly, to borrow again Lord Finlay\u2019s language, the order here, as well as in the Vancouver case15, did not proceed \u201con any consideration of danger arising from the level crossing (there was no level crossing in this case), or as having anything to do with the railway as such\u201d. If in the Vancouver case15 the matter could be treated \u201cas one merely of street improvement\u201d, we have certainly here a \u201cstreet improvement\u201d effected in order to accommodate increased traffic upon the highway. No question arose as to \u201cthe protection, safety and convenience of the public\u201d in connection with a railway crossing, any danger to the public having been eliminated by the existing bridge.\nThe only distinction I can find between the Vancouver case15 and the presenione (That the proper grade of the streets was a consideration in the former case does not, in my opinion, amount to a substantial difference), is that in the Vancouver case[16] the order was permissive while here it is mandatory. However, it seems clear that if the circumstances do not give the Board jurisdiction to make a permissive order, they could hardly be relied on to confer upon it jurisdiction to render its order mandatory.\nIn substance the Railway Act, as far as applicable to a case like the one under consideration, has not been changed since the two decisions of the Judicial Committee. It is true that section 39 (the former section 59) now refers to the case where the Board, in the exercise of any power vested in it, \u201cdirects or permits\u201d any structure, etc., and this probably makes any distinction between a permissive and a mandatory order immaterial. But as the matter stands, I cannot see how it can be contended that the Vancouver case16, as explained in the Toronto case[17], does not fully apply here.\nThis appears to me decisive of the issue, and I am unable to support the jurisdiction of the Board to make the order complained of.\nI would answer the first question in the negative.
