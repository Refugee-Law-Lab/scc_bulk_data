Singer, (1916) 52 S.C.R. 447\nDate: 1916-02-01\nMoses Joel Singer, Executor of the Estate of Jacob Singer, Deceased, and Others (Plaintiffs) Appellants;\nand\nAnnie Singer, Executrix, and Others (Defendants) Respondents.\n1915: December 2, 3; 1916: February 1.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies, Idington, Duff, Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ONTARIO.\nWill\u2014Construction\u2014Devise of income\u2014Trust\u2014Codicil\u2014Postponement of division\u2014Maintenance of children.\nThe will of S. contained the following provision: \u201cI direct my said trustees to pay to my wife Annie Singer, during the term of her natural life and as long as she will remain my widow, the net annual income arising from my estate for the maintenance of herself and our children; should, however, my wife remarry then such annuity shall cease.\u201d\nHeld, that Annie Singer was entitled to said income during her widowhood for her own use absolutely, but subject to an obligation to provide, in her discretion, for the maintenance of the children, which discretion would not be controlled nor interfered with so long as it was exercised in good faith. Such obligation did not extend to a child married or otherwise forisfamiliated.\nPer Anglin J.\u2014The jurisdiction to determine the good or bad faith of the widow on an originating notice is questionable.\nAnother clause of the will directed the trustees \u201cto pay to each of my sons who shall reach the age of thirty years a sum equal to half that portion of my estate to which such son is entitled under this my will upon the death of his mother. * * * Such payment to be considered as a loan from the estate.\u201d A codicil added several years later contained this provision: \u201cI hereby further direct that my real property shall not be divided among the beneficiaries as directed by my will until after the lapse of ten years from my death.\u201d Held, that the division so postponed was not the final division to be made on the death or marriage of the widow; that it had the effect of postponing any advance to a son thirty years old of half his portion until the ten years from the testators\u2019 death had expired so far as such advance would necessitate the sale or mortgage of any of the real estate.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division (33 Ont. L.R. 602) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], varying the judgment of Middleton J. at the hearing.\nThe proceedings in this case were begun by originating summons to obtain the construction of certain provisions in the will of the late Jacob Singer. These provisions are set out in full in the above head-note and in the opinions of the judges one clause gave the net income of the estate to the testator\u2019s wife during her life and widowhood for the maintenance of herself and children. The appellants claimed that she received the income in trust for such maintenance and Middleton J. so held. This was overruled by the Appellate Division and the clause construed as giving her the income for her own absolute use with an obligation to provide in her discretion for maintenance of the family.\nAnother clause provided for the advance, by way of loan, to any son reaching the age of thirty of half the portion he would be entitled to on the death or marriage of his mother. By a codicil the testator directed that his real estate should not be divided until the expiration of ten years from his death. The court below held that the advance to sons of thirty was by this codicil postponed for ten years from testator\u2019s death unless it could be made out of the per- sonalty. These were the two questions raised for decision in the Supreme Court.\nDewart K.C. for the appellant M.J. Singer. According to the later decisions the widow took the income in trust and the rights of the children therein would be enforced by the courts. In re Booth[2]; In re G. Infants[3].\nMaintenance is not limited to children not forisfamiliated. In re Miller[4].\nCowan K.C. and Rose K.C. for the other appellants.\nWatson K.C. for the respondent Annie Singer. The testator wished his wife to have the income and use it in her discretion. The court will not interfere with such discretion when exercised in good faith. Lambe v. Eames[5]; Jones v. Greatwood[6]; In re Atkinson[7]; In re Barrett[8].\nAs to right of children forisfamiliated see Cook v. Noble[9].\nHolman K.C. for the other respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014The difference of opinion between the trial judge, Middleton J., and the Appellate Division as to the rights of the widow Annie Singer to the net annual income arising from the estate during her widowhood is not very great. After consideration of the arguments advanced at bar on the construction of the provisions of the will and codicil relating to this net annual income, I accept that of the Appellate Division as probably the more correct one.\nWith respect to the construction of the clause providing for advancement to those sons of the testator who reached the age of thirty, I entertained at the close of the argument a good deal of doubt. The reasons given in the dissenting judgment of Mr. Justice Magee are strong and cogent in favour of the construction he adopted that the codicil did not interfere with the provision in the will for payment by way of loan to the sons on attaining the age of thirty years.\nWhile I agree that the solution of the question is surrounded with difficulties, I have reached the conclusion that the arguments in favour of the construction adopted by the Appellate Division preponderate, and that the effect of paragraph 10 of the codicil is to postpone the right under the will of the sons who attain the age of thirty to be paid the one-half of their shares except as stated by the Chief Justice\nin so far as it may be precticable to make payments to them out of the personalty and the proceeds of such of the real property as the trustees may have sold.\nOn the whole, I adopt the reasoning and conclusions of Chief Justice Sir William Meredith and would dismiss the appeal.\nUnder the circumstances and the reasonable doubts existing as to the true construction of these clauses of the will taken together with Mr. Justice Magee\u2019s dissenting opinion, I would not allow costs against appellants but would let each party pay his own.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The conditions existent in this family are unsatisfactory. I should, however, be sorry to in- crease and intensify their troubles and then perpetuate them by substituting the discretion of the court for that of the mother whom the testator had wisely chosen to be head of the family when he was gone. She may make mistakes, but her maternal instincts will probably rectify or ameliorate them. The court substituting itself for her inevitaibly must make mistakes it never can rectify.\nThe carefully prepared judgment of the learned Chief Justice of Ontario, with which I agree, leaves nothing more for me to say on the question of interference with the mode of the mother\u2019s exercising her judgment.\nThe formal judgment of the Appellate Division lays down correctly the lines to be observed and yet as I read it puts no bar in the way of the mother aiding when they deserve it, even those over twenty-one and forisfamiliated.\nOn the question arising upon the construction of clause 10 of the codicil I agree with the result reached by the judgment appealed from.\nThe testator by a will made in 1904 directed as follows:\u2014\nI direct my said trustees to pay to each of my sons who shall reach the age of thirty years a sum equal to half that portion of my estate to which such son is entitled under this my will upon the death of his mother, such portion to be valued at the time of each son attaining his thirtieth year, the valuation to be made by my executors and trustees and shall be final. Such payment to be considered as a loan from the estate,\nand on 31st October, 1911, two weeks before his death, made a long codicil thereto of which clause No. 10 is as follows:\u2014\n10. I hereby further direct that my real property shall not be divided among the beneficiaries as directed by my will until after the lapse of ten years from my death, and I further direct that the business of managing my real estate shall be carried on by my sons as it has been carried on heretofore, and I direct that my sons shall receive such salaries as shall seem just in the discretion of my executors in remuneration for their services.\nAnd clause No. 14, the last, is as follows:\u2014\n14. And I further direct that anything mentioned in the aforesaid will which is at variance with the provisions mentioned in this codicil, shall be subservient and subject to this codicil.\nThe estate, at his death, consisted chiefly of over three hundred parcels of real estate in Toronto.\nFour of his sons had then reached the thirty-year limit.\nThe estate was under mortgages to three-eighths of its value. Much of it was unproductive or in a state of dilapidation, needing repair. These and many other known circumstances must be borne in mind in attempting the interpretation and construction of this codicil. We can say nothing of the unknown which the prudent testator refrains from disclosing and which we cannot appreciate in order to help construction.\nI should have supposed, but for judicial differences of opinion, the mere reading of this clause No. 10, in light of the surrounding facts and circumstances, restricted as it is to real estate, was so plain as to need no aid. But in effect it is urged that it must have read into it the word \u201cfinally\u201d as qualifying the word \u201cdivided\u201d therein. For the argument presented by appellant means, if anything, that the distribution provided for by the clause I have quoted from the will, was not in substance a division pro tanto, though conditionally subject, however, in case of a shrinkage of the estate to a return or reduction in share, but merely a loan, and that according to some theories put forward, on good security and bearing a good rate of interest; the prospective share in the estate, of course, forming part of the security.\nIf it was in essential characteristics merely a loan, why all this litigation? The parties concerned, over thirty years of age, could possibly borrow in Toronto on their respective shares almost as advantageously as the executors without all this expensive litigation to be paid for, in addition to the usual commissions on such transactions.\nPlus the contingency of death without issue, possibly insurable against, there is not much difference in the character of the borrowing by the trustees sought herein to be immediately enforced by this proceeding and that obtainable by each of the appellants in respect of his share.\nFor admittedly the trustees of the estate cannot just now in the present state of the market sell its real estate and can only meet the obligations which the construction contended for would involve, by borrowing at a great disadvantage.\nAll this is, it may be said, aside from the question of construction. I agree. I only desire to illustrate the real nature of what is contended for by those relying upon the language used in the clause relative to the advances to be made being merely loans to those attaining thirty years of age.\nWhat has happened may, or may not, have been within the contemplation of the testator when making his will, but assuredly it was when making his codicil thereto, and anything in the will at variance therewith is expressly made subservient to the codicil. Such submission extends to the giving, if need be, of an en- tirely different shade of meaning to that it might have borne standing alone and amid entirely different surrounding circumstances.\nI think, however, such advances were merely intended to be pro tanto a distribution of the estate, but in order to provide for the contingencies necessary to be kept in view, having regard to the equal division ultimately to be made and contemplated by the testator, should be in such view, but in that only, treated as loans.\nAssuming any such advance made upon terms only within the language of the clause and without any further stipulation for its return than implied therein, is it at all conceivable that any court would maintain an action for the recovery back of any part thereof, save so far as needed to produce the equal distribution contemplated?\nIf not, then the advance is to the extent not so recoverable neither more nor less than the division in the language of the codicil\namong the beneficiaries as directed by my will.\nAgain, the language of the clause itself presupposes the money in hand; for nowhere is there any direction to sell or mortgage for any such purpose. To imply such an imperative direction in the clause or whole will (to be read now in light of the codicil now dominating its expressions) dealing with such an estate as left at the death of the testator, would be, I think, attributing to him a want of that business sense and foresight which, I think, he was possessed of.\nIf no other question had been raised than one asking the court to compel the trustees to mortgage and pay for such a purpose, would the court have listened to it and acceded to that which might spell ruin for the estate?\nThe testator realizing, as every sane man of experience and foresight must have done in the end of October, 1911, that by the end of a year thence, when his will would have become operative for purposes of partial distributions, and the fruits of real estate speculation would have begun to ripen; and of these a long period of depression in real estate was sure to ensue, provided against such contingencies. He realized the possibly disastrous results of an enforced distribution under such conditions of a large part of his estate. He wisely anticipated all that and what was or might be involved therein and provided against it by clause No. 10 of this codicil.\nWe are invited to frustrate his purpose by putting on his will, and on this codicil, a construction that I venture to think would have surprised him. So far common knowledge, if we use it, can guide us.\nBut in view of the lapse of time between the making of will and codicil, it is not at all improbable, in light of the story unfolded herein by some of those concerned, that in the development of his sons he had found something to warrant him in providing (in a way his earlier hopes in that regard induced him to refrain from) against their possible or probable improvidence or that of some of them.\nI do not think we are entitled to frustrate the results he aimed at, whatever they were, by placing upon his language used in clause No. 10, and clearly emphasized in clause No. 14, a construction it does not necessarily bear.\nMoreover, it is quite clear he left to the future developments, that time and chance might bring, the earlier conversion, in the ordinary prudent way, of his real estate into personalty, whereupon the clause for partial distribution would become operative.\nThe power of sale remained intact, save that impliedly it was not to be used in obedience to an enforced demand for distribution within the period of ten years.\nI need not dwell upon the bearing of other minor considerations such as, the income of the estate belonging to the widow and the consequent results upon it by the construction contended for; and the salaries provided in the codicil for the management of the estate by his sons, and the possibility of the codicil having been drawn by a non-professional hand as the providing for a seal in the execution thereof indicates.\nThe true construction must ever be in the case of a will, the ascertainment of the purposes of the testator to be gathered from the will read in light of the circumstances known to surround him making it and not least of these the condition of the estate.\nThen its entire scope and purposes must be kept in view and no single feature, unless so expressed as in this codicil, allowed to dominate the rest. So treating will and codicil I do not feel any doubt in the results I have reached.\nI agree that no compensation is allowable to the executors. The actual labour in that connection is provided for by salaries to be paid the sons in regard thereto. The responsibility evidently was not to be compensated for.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014The important question turns upon the effect of clause ten of the codicil. It is by no means free from doubt, but I think effect may be given to the intention of the testator, as I infer from the admitted facts, without doing violence to the language. The intention unquestionably was, I think, to prohibit a sale of any part of the real estate for a period of ten years.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The first question presented on this appeal is as to the effect of the following provision of the will of the late Jacob Singer:\u2014\nI direct my said trustees to pay to my wife Annie Singer during the term of her natural life and as long as she will remain my widow the net annual income arising from my estate for the maintenance of herself and our children; should, however, my wife remarry, then such annuity shall cease.\nMiddleton J., who heard the case in the first instance on an originating notice, held that:\u2014\nThe said Annie Singer is not entitled to the net annual income arising from the said estate to her own use absolutely, but subject to the obligation to use the same not only for her maintenance, but also for the maintenance of the children of the testator, and that the right of any child to maintenance does not cease on attaining majority or marriage;\nand he directed a reference to determine what allowance, if any, should be made to each of the children of Jacob Singer out of the income of the estate.\nThe Appellate Division varied this judgment by declaring that:\u2014\nThe said Annie Singer is entitled to the net annual income arising from the said estate during her widowhood for her own use absolutely, but subject to an obligation to provide thereout for the maintenance of the children of the testator or such of them as in her discretion to be exercised in good faith she shall deem to require the same, but such obligation does not extend to any child who has or shall be married or otherwise be forisfamiliated. The appellants contend for the restoration of the judgment of Middleton J. The respondent Annie Singer upholds the judgment of the Appellate Division. The other respondents, represented by Mr. Holman, maintain that the interest of Annie Singer is absolute; that any obligation imposed upon her is not in the nature of a trust, but is purely moral; and that the children have no interest legally enforceable. The difference between the respective orders made by Middleton J. and by the Appellate Division (apart from the exclusion of children married, or otherwise forisfamiliated) would seem to be that, under the latter, the discretion of the mother is wider and enables her, for reasons that seem to her sufficient, to exclude any child from maintenance. Interference of the court is limited to a case of mala fides in the exercise of her discretion.\nWith Sir George Mellish L.J.:\u2014\nI do not understand how a Court of Equity can execute a trust where the testator says that he has such confidence in his widow that he wishes her, and not the Court of Chancery, to say what share she shall have and what share the children shall have. Lambe v. Eames[10].\nAccording to many authorities language such as that used by the testator does not create a complete trust in the strict sense; Bond v. Dickinson[11]; Lambe v. Eames10; Mackett v. Mackett[12]; Allen v. Furness[13]; Re Shortreed[14]; Atkinson v. Atkinson[15]. But there are, no doubt, other authorities in which the contrary has been held, e.g., Scott v. Key[16]; Woods v. Woods[17]; Longmore v. Elcum[18]. The line is difficult to draw. But the cases rather seem to indicate that a bequest of income will more readily be held to impose a trust, especially if given to the mother, than a similarly phrased gift of the corpus. Eversley on Domestic Relations (3 ed.), p. 688. Yet whether she should, or should not, be held to be a trustee, the authorities seem to establish that there is an obligation toward the children imposed upon a widow to whom money is bequeathed for the support of herself and her children, which the court will, under certain circumstances, enforce. Allan v. Furness[19], and Booth v. Booth[20], are instances in which the court interfered to protect the fund in the interests of the children against creditors of a legatee subject to an obligation of maintenance. In re G. Infants[21] is a case in which the court interfered on an admission of obligation made by an immoral mother. Thorp v. Owen[22] was a case of admitted trust. But there are other cases in which, without holding that a trust had been created, the courts have, as against the parent, asserted the existence of an obligation in favour of the children which they would enforce. Re Robertson\u2019s Trust[23]; Raikes v. Ward[24]; Castle v. Castle[25]; Browne v. Paull[26]; In re Pollock[27]. A fortiori, if there be a trust, however wide the discretion, the court will interfere in the event of failure or refusal to exercise it honestly.\nAs Theobald says (7 ed.), p. 491:\u2014 The decisions upon gifts to a parent for the benefit of himself and his children run into fine distinctions.\nSee cases collected in Lewin on Trusts (10 ed), at p. 157, and Jarman on Wills (10 ed.), pp. 890 et seq.\nAfter fully considering all the provisions of Jacob Singer\u2019s will, I agree with the view expressed by Middleton J., when, speaking of the testator\u2019s intention, he said:\u2014\nMr. Singer undoubtedly had unbounded confidence in his wife. Many expressions in the will point in that direction; and I think that his dominant intention was that during the lifetime of the wife, so long as she remained his widow, she should occupy substantially the same position towards the children as he occupied himself.\nIn that view there would be no trust properly so called. The obligation of the mother would be almost purely moral. The only right enforceable against her in the courts would be the right to support which the law gives to minor children against their father, commensurate with his means and station in life, subject to the further limitation, that the court will not interfere to enforce that right against the mother if she should, in the bon\u00e2 fide exercise of her discretion, determine that the circumstances warrant her withholding maintenance in part or in whole in the case of any child. That, I take it, is the measure of the children\u2019s right which the judgment of the Appellate Division accords.\nThis wide discretion the mother appears to have under such a provision as that with which we are dealing, which involves determining from time to time and under varying circumstances how much of the income should be used for each and any of the purposes indicated, and it is subject to curial interference or control only when it is shewn that she has not exer- cised it fairly and honestly; Costabadie v. Costabadie[28]; Tabor v. Brooks[29]; Re Roper\u2019s Trusts[30].\nI am, with respect, of the opinion that this is the correct interpretation of the disposition made by the testator of the income of his estate. I desire, however, not to be understood as dissenting from the view expressed in the Appellate Division that, under the doctrine stare decisis, whatever may be the view now prevailing in England (Theobald (7 ed.), 495; Lewin on Trusts (10 ed.), p. 159), in Ontario the view expressed in Cook v. Noble[31], that married and otherwise forisfamiliated children are not entitled to share in a gift for maintenance such as this should be adhered to. But there is nothing to prevent the mother applying a part of the income for the benefit of adult and married children who may need assistance, if she can do so consistently with her duty to herself and her unmarried minor children.\nI question the jurisdiction on an originating notice to determine the issue of good or bad faith on the part of the widow. At all events, if such a jurisdiction exists, I think the better course is that which has been taken in the Appellate Division, viz., in the first instance to dispose of the questions of construction and to determine finally the rights of the parties under the will, leaving it to the children, after that has been done, to proceed, if they should deem it necessary and proper, to seek the aid of the court to enforce the rights so declared.\nI would, for these reasons, maintain the judgment of the Appellate Division on the first branch of the appeal. The next question is whether the provision of the will which directs the trustees\nto pay to each of my sons who shall reach the age of thirty years a sum equal to half that portion of my estate to which that son is entitled under this my will upon the death of his mother, such portion to be valued at the time of each son attaining his thirtieth year, the valuation to be made by my executors and trustees and shall be final. Such payment to be considered as a loan from the estate,\nis affected by clause 10 of the codicil.\n10. I hereby further direct that my real property shall not be divided among the beneficiaries as directed by my will until after the lapse of ten years from my death, and I further direct that the business of managing my real estate shall be carried on by my sons as it has been carried on heretofore, and I direct that my sons shall receive such salaries as shall seem just in the discretion of my executors in remuneration for their services.\nThe will provided for the distribution of the estate on the death or remarriage of the widow, any advances previously made being brought into hotchpot. The appellant contends that it is only to this final distribution that the provision of the codicil applies and that it does not control or affect the right of the sons to advancements under the clause above quoted.\nThe will was made in 1904; the codicil in 1911, a month before the testator died. At his death his estate consisted almost entirely of real property. Up to five years before his death he had carried on the business of a watchmaker, jeweller, and money lender. The capital invested in that business appears upon its discontinuance to have been used in acquiring lands and houses. The condition of the testator\u2019s estate, as it existed in 1904, when his will was made, had, therefore, been materially changed when he made the codicil in 1911. Assets of other kinds, no doubt consider- able in amount, and out of which the advancements to the sons might have been made, had in the interval been converted into real estate. This circumstance must be borne in mind in considering the effect of the codicil, which not only postpones a division of the real estate for a period of ten years, but directs that the business of managing it shall be carried on as theretofore. I am of opinion that the dominant purpose disclosed by this codicil was that, saving the power to make sales demanded by good management, the real estate should be kept intact for a period of ten years, and that any provision of the will in favour of beneficiaries, other than specific or pecuniary legatees, inconsistent with that purpose should yield to it. For the purpose of this provision of the codicil advancements to the sons which would entail a disposition of the real estate would, in my opinion, be in the nature of a division which the testator meant to prohibit. It has been suggested that the portions to be advanced might be raised under the trustees\u2019 power to mortgage. But, apart from the fact that the existence of mortgage incumbrances on the estate to the extent of $360,000 might well render that method of procuring money impracticable, it might entail the defeat of the very purpose which the testator had in view in making the codicil and would be an indirect method of accomplishing that which I cannot but think he intended to provide against. For these reasons and for those stated by Mr. Justice Middleton and the Chief Justice of Ontario, I would affirm the Judgment in appeal on this question.\nI have no doubt that by the 11th clause of the codicil directing that no salary shall be paid to the execu- tors for their services as executors, the testator meant to deprive them of all right to remuneration in any form for their services in the administration of his estate.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs. Having had the opinion of two courts against them on the main question\u2014their right to immediate advancements\u2014the appellants should, I think, have been satisfied. The slight difference in opinion between Mr. Justice Middleton and the Appellate Division as to the extent of the widow\u2019s discretion and the propriety of curial interference would not, in my opinion, justify our encouraging the carrying of appeals in cases such as this beyond the provincial courts, as we would do were we to award the appellants costs out of the estate or relieve them from payment of the costs of the respondents.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014After a great deal of hesitation I have come to the conclusion that this appeal should be dismissed.\nIn directing his trustees to pay to his wife the annual income arising from his estate, the testator intended to give her discretion as to the way she would dispose of that money for the maintenance of their children. She is expected to exercise that discretion with impartiality and wisdom. It may be that in the past the mandate imposed upon her has not been discharged in a satisfactory way, but it is expected that she will in the future treat all her children in a most just, equitable and impartial way. On the other point in issue, I agree with the construction put on the will by the Appellate Division.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant Moses Joel Singer: Dewart, May & Hodgson.\nSolicitors for the other appellants: Beatty, Blackstock, Fasken, Cowan & Chadwick.\nSolicitors for the respondent Annie Singer: Watson, Smoke, Smith & Sinclair.\nSolicitor for the other respondents: Charles J.

[1914] c. 195\u2014R.S.O. [1914] c. 186.\nBy the Ontario Assessment Act an appeal is given from a decision of the Court of Revision to the county court judge with, in certain cases, a further appeal to the Railway and Municipal Board. A railway company took an appeal direct from the Court of Revision to the Board. When the appeal came up for hearing the chairman stated that the Board was without jurisdiction and the parties joined in a consent to its being heard as if on appeal from the county court judge. The Board then heard the appeal and gave judgment dismissing it. The companies applied for and obtained leave to appeal from said judgment, under section 80 of the \u201cAssessment Act,\u201d which allows an appeal on a question of law only, to the Appellate Division which reversed it. On appeal from the last mentioned judgment to the Supreme Court of Canada,\nHeld, Fitzpatrick C.J. and Idington J. dissenting, that the case was not adjudicated upon by the Board extra cursum curi\u0153; that it came before the Appellate Division and was heard and decided in the ordinary way; an appeal would therefore lie to the Supreme Court under section 41 of the \u201cSupreme Court Act.\u201d\nPer Duff J.\u2014The decision of the Board that the objection to its jurisdiction could be waived and that it could lawfully hear the appeal from the Court of Revision direct (and affirm or amend the assessment) given at the invitation of both parties pursuant to an agreement between them and acted upon by the Board in hearing the appeal on the merits, and acted on by the Appellate Division, is binding on the parties and not open to question on this appeal: Ex parte Pratt (12 Q.B.D. 334); Forrest v. Harvey (4 Bell App. Cas. 197); Gandy v. Gandy (30 Ch. D. 57); Roe v. Mutual Loan Fund Association (19. Q.B.D. 347); and, consequently, the appellant municipality is precluded from contending on appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada that, in the circumstances, the Appellate Division had no authority under the \u201cAssessment Act\u201d to declare the assessment illegal.\nA railway company, under authority of the Parliament of Canada, built an international bridge over the St. Lawrence River at Cornwall and have since run trains over it.\nHeld, that such superstructure supported by piers resting on Crown soil and licensed for railway purposes was not included in the railway property assessable under sec. 47 of the \u201cOntario Assessment Act\u201d (R.S.O. [1914] ch. 195); if it is included it is exempt from taxation under sub-sec. 3 of sec. 47.\nJudgment appealed against (34 Ont. L.R. 55) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], reversing the ruling of the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board and quashing the assessment of the respondents\u2019 bridge over the St. Lawrence.\nTwo questions arose on the appeal. First, had the Railway and Municipal Board jurisdiction to deal with the matter except on appeal from a decision of the county court judge? Secondly, had the Township of Cornwall a right to assess the respondents for the Canadian portion of their bridge over the St. Lawrence? The Appellate Division decided against the right to assess.\nWatson K.C. and Gogo for the appellant.\nEwart K.C. and W.L. Scott for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting).\u2014I think this appeal must be allowed on the ground that the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board had no jurisdiction to hear the appeal from the Court of Revision of the Township of Cornwall. The judgment of the Board was a complete nullity and the Appellate Division could not vary it.\nThe \u201cAssessment Act,\u201d R.S.O. 1914, ch. 195, contains the following sections:\u2014\n72. Sub-sec. 1.\u2014An appeal to the county judge shall lie at the instance of the municipal corporation, or at the instance of the assessor, or assessment commissioner, or at the instance of any municipal elector of the municipality not only against a decision of the Court of Revision on an appeal to the said court, but also against any omission, neglect or refusal of the said court to hear or decide an appeal.\n79. The decision or judgment of the judge or acting judge shall be final and conclusive in every case adjudicated upon.\n80. (1) Where a person is assessed to an amount aggregating in a municipality in territory without county organization $10,000 or upwards, an appeal shall lie from the decision of the judge to the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board and any person who had appealed or was entitled to appeal from the Court of Revision to the judge shall be entitled to make the appeal to the Board.\n(2) An appeal to the Board shall also lie where the amount, though originally less than the sum mentioned in the next preceding sub-section, has been increased by the Court of Revision or by the judge so that it equals or exceeds that sum.\n(6) An appeal shall lie from the decision of the Board under this section to a Divisional Court upon all questions of law, but such appeal shall not lie unless leave to appeal is given by the said court upon application of any party and upon hearing the parties and the Board.\nAt the opening of the proceedings before the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board the Chairman said:\u2014\nThe Board has already held that it has no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal from the Court of Revision; an appeal only lies to the Board from the county judge.\nNevertheless the Board by consent of the parties proceeded to hear and adjudicate upon the matter.\nIt is perfectly clear that no consent of the parties can give to the court a jurisdiction which it does not possess. In the case of In re Aylmer[2], at p. 262, Lord Esher M.R. said:\u2014\nIf on the other hand it is an attempt to give to the court a similar power resting on the consent of the parties, the well known rule applies that the consent of parties cannot give the court a jurisdiction which it does not otherwise possess.\nIn the American and English Encyc. of Law and Practice, vol. 4, under the title \u201cAppeal,\u201d it is said in a note on p. 44:\u2014\nWhen an appeal should have been taken to an intermediate appellate court, consent cannot give the Supreme Court jurisdiction of it.\nThe statute having ordained the means by which an appeal may be brought against an assessment and prescribed the courts which shall have power to entertain such appeal, the parties cannot at their own pleasure agree on a different procedure. This is no mere question of formality or abbreviation of procedure. In every legal proceeding it Would certainly be simpler to go per saltum direct to the final court of appeal. If this course had been permissible the parties need never have gone to the Railway and Municipal Board at all, but might have carried an appeal direct from the Court of Revision to the Appellate Division or even this court if we had been willing to entertain it.\nIf the court has no jurisdiction to hear a cause, its proceedings cannot, of course, be in any way validated by an appeal from the judgment, neither can the court to which the appeal is carried entertain the same. Encyc. of Law and Practice, vol. 4, p. 46:\u2014\nThough an appeal will lie to the Supreme Court from a decision of an appellate court in a case in which the court has no juris- diction by reason of any of the questions involved, the appeal cannot be entertained by the Supreme Court for the purpose of passing upon the merits of the case, but only for the purpose of reversing or vacating the judgment of the Appellate Court and remanding the cause to that court with direction to dismiss the appeal.\nI think it is only necessary to point out in addition that the rules which would ordinarily govern in cases between private individuals do so with greater force in one in which the public has an interest. In the present case we have a court without jurisdiction undertaking to direct the alteration of a municipal assessment roll. This it certainly can obtain no authority to do from any consent of parties.\nDAVIES J.\u2014The competency of this court to entertain this appeal was first challenged on the ground that the parties had agreed during the course of the litigation to skip the statutory appeal to the county judge from the Court of Revision and appeal directly from the latter court to the Board of Railway Commissioners.\nAt the hearing, the Board called attention to this deviation from the course of the statutory proceedings, but as it would appear to have been then the desire of both parties, in order to abbreviate procedure and save expense, went on and heard and dismissed the appeal.\nOn that hearing after some discussion between counsel on the question of the necessity of an appeal to the county judge before coming to the Board of Railway Commissioners, Mr. Scott for the railway company said:\u2014\nThen this appeal will be taken as if it had gone before the county judge and we are appealing against an adverse decision of the county judge, which apparently was accepted as the correct statement of the fact, whereupon the chairman said:\u2014\nYour contention is that under the provisions of the \u201cAssessment Act\u201d the property is not assessable.\nThere is not anything, however, in the proceedings before the Railway Board indicating any intention upon the part of either party to treat the proceeding as one extra cursum curi\u0153 and to ask the Board to act as arbitrators merely. On the contrary, it was to be treated\nas if there had been an appeal to the county judge and the railway company was appealing against an adverse decision of his.\nThe question both parties desired to have decided was that stated by the chairman: Was or was not the bridge over the St. Lawrence River assessable property?\nIt is only fair to say that counsel for the municipality followed the chairman\u2019s statement with a claim that counsel for the railway should admit that the bridge \u201cwas not on railway lands,\u201d apparently to exclude a claim that it was exempted under sub-section 3 of section 47 of the \u201cAssessment Act,\u201d which admission counsel for the railway company, evidently acting upon an understanding which had been reached, immediately made qualifying the admission afterwards with the statement that\nsome portions of the bridge might be on railway lands, but the whole bridge is over the St. Lawrence River.\nAs a fact, the bridge is one known as a cantilever bridge which crossed the St. Lawrence, an international public river. It was contended at bar that this admission, when read with the concurrent statements, was a concession as to the facts only, leaving the broad question open as one of law whether such a bridge \u201cnot on the lands of the railway,\u201d but crossing the St. Lawrence River came within the provisions of the \u201cAssessment Act.\u201d\nIt is well to note that while section 48 of the \u201cRailway and Municipal Board Act,\u201d ch. 186, R.S.O., gives an appeal from the Board to a Divisional Court upon a question of jurisdiction or upon any question of law, sub-section 6 of section 80 of the \u201cAssessment Act,\u201d ch. 195, R.S.O., enacts:\u2014\nAn appeal shall lie from the decision of the Board under this section to a Divisional Court upon the questions of law,\nomitting any reference to questions of jurisdiction. Under both Acts, the appeals are dependent upon leave being obtained from the Divisional Court, but under the \u201cAssessment Act\u201d they are confined to appeals \u201cupon questions of law,\u201d while under the \u201cBoard Act\u201d they expressly embrace questions of jurisdiction as well as of law. I conceive the legislature intended that in all cases where the Board had original jurisdiction under the Act constituting it, leave to appeal might be granted either on questions of jurisdiction or of law while such leave could only be granted from the Board\u2019s decisions when acting under the \u201cAssessment Act\u201d as a court of appeal, on questions of law.\nLeave on this appeal was only granted as it could only be granted under the provisions of the \u201cAssessment Act\u201d on a question of law, which in this particular case was whether the particular bridge was or was not within the \u201cAssessment Act\u201d and liable to be assessed.\nOn the question of jurisdiction I have reached the conclusion that the Divisional Court of Appeal had jurisdiction to grant leave to appeal from the judg- ment of the Railway Board and to hear and determine the question of law raised, and that the appeal to this court from their judgment is competent.\nI so hold upon the broad grounds that the parties to the appeal were within the jurisdiction of the Railway Board, that the subject matter of the appeal was one within the competence of that Board to decide upon and that while the agreed departure by the parties from the regular procedure to bring the matter before the Board was, it is true, a deviation from the cursus curi\u0153, it was not an attempt to give the Board a jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties it did not possess, or such a departure from the ordinary practice by consent as would deprive either of the parties of the right of appeal from the Board\u2019s decision. No objection was taken to the jurisdiction of the Appellate Division to grant leave to appeal to that court. No objection to the Appellate Division\u2019s jurisdiction was raised before that court on the argument of the appeal. It is clear that all parties thought such an appeal would lie, and it hardly seems to me open to argument that the Court of Appeal acted as arbitrators only and not as a competent court believing it had full jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties.\nThe judgments of their Lordships of the Judicial Committee in the appeal of Pisani v. The Attorney-General for Gibraltar[3], in which Sir Montague Smith reviews Bickett v. Morris[4], and other cases upon the question I am discussing seems to me to lay down at p. 522 the true principle upon which deviations from the cursus curi\u0153 should be determined. It is true that there was a deviation from the cursus curi\u0153, but the court had jurisdiction over the subject, and the assumption of the duty of another tribunal is not involved in the question. Departures from ordinary practice by consent are of every day occurrence; but unless there is an attempt to give the court a jurisdiction which it does not possess, or something occurs which is such a violent strain upon its procedure that it puts it entirely out of its course, so that a Court of Appeal cannot properly review the decision, such departures have never been held to deprive either of the parties of the right of appeal.\nAs to the merits, I have had much difficulty in construing and reconciling the several provisions and sub-sections of section 47 of the \u201cAssessment Act,\u201d but I agree that the language of sub-section 3, beginning with the words: \u201cNotwithstanding anything in this Act contained,\u201d makes it clear that the superstructures, etc., \u201con railway lands\u201d (outside of the specified exceptions named in sub-section 2 within which this bridge does not admittedly come) \u201cshall not be assessed.\u201d\nThis railway cantilever bridge spanning the St. Lawrence, it was claimed by respondent was admitted by Mr. Scott before the Board \u201cnot to be on railway lands\u201d and so, it was claimed not to be within the exemption of sub-section 3. Apart from such admission, I would feel strongly inclined to hold that as a matter of law this bridge was on railway lands and was exempt.\nFor me, however, a larger and broader question arises than the meaning of the exempting clause read in connection with the admission referred to or irrespective of that admission and that is whether such a bridge as this comes within section 47 at all.\nIt is not enough to satisfy the court that under the circumstances and in view of the admission of Mr. Scott the bridge does not come within the exempting clause of the Act. The appellant must go further and shew that it comes with reasonable clearness within the provisions authorizing the assessment of railway property.\nWhere is the language to be found evidencing an intention on the part of the legislature to authorize the assessment of such a bridge or that part of it within Dominion territory? The soil of the river to the international line is in the Crown, the abutments supporting the bridge are built in and upon the soil. The river is a public international river, and I agree with the Divisional Court that the bridge over that soil authorized to be so constructed by the Dominion Parliament should be held, as the Divisional Court held, to be in one sense a part of the soil itself. It is a unique structure not provided for by the clauses of the \u201cAssessment Act\u201d authorizing the assessment of property.\nBuilt under the authority and with the licence of the Dominion Parliament over a public international river the soil of which to the boundary line is in the Crown, with supporting piers in this Crown soil, this \u201csuperstructure\u201d is then licensed by legislative authority for railway purposes and, as I have said, is part of that soil. I am unable to conclude that the word \u201chighway\u201d used in connection with the words \u201cstreet or road\u201d in clause (c) of sub-section 2 of section 47 includes this public international river. I am not able to find any words in the clauses authorizing assessments of bridges or superstructures on railways which would include such a unique structure as this and being unable to find language authorizing with reasonable clearness such an inclusion I must, of course, hold the bridge not be assessable. As was said by Lord Chancellor Loreburn in Banknock Coal Co. v. Lawrie[5], at pp. 110-11, quoted at p. 737 of Mr. Chartres\u2019s Book on the Judicial Interpretations of Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law:\u2014\nWe are not at liberty to amplify an enactment so as to include within its ambit matters which upon the plain meaning of the language are not included, even if convinced that the omission was inadvertent and undersigned.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014This appeal comes to us under somewhat peculiar circumstances; by virtue of section 41 of the \u201cSupreme Court Act,\u201d which I shall presently refer to and examine. The respondents appealed against their assessment, for the year 1914, in respect of a bridge over part of the St. Lawrence River, by the township assessor, to the Court of Revision to which no evidence was presented and thereupon the appeal was dismissed.\nSection 70 of the Assessment Act provides in such case that:\u2014\nThe roll as finally passed by the court, and certified by the clerk as passed, shall, except in so far as the same may be further amended on appeal to the judge of the county court be valid, and bind all parties concerned, notwithstanding any defect or error committed in or with regard to such roll, etc., etc.\nThere was no appeal taken to the county judge as provided by the Act against the judgment of dismissal by the Court of Revision.\nThe Act provides for such an appeal and what the judge in such case is to do and thereupon declares as follows:\u2014\nThe decision and judgment of the judge or acting judge shall be final and conclusive in every case adjudicated upon. No such appeal was taken.\nSection 80 of said Act provides in cases of which this might have been one that\nan appeal shall lie from the decision of the judge to the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board, and any person who had appealed or was entitled to appeal from the Court of Revision to the judge shall be entitled to make the appeal to the Board.\nThe respondents gave notice of an appeal to said Board in the following terms:\u2014\nTake notice that the Ottawa and New York Railway Company, the New York and Ottawa Railway Company and New York Central Lines intend to appeal and hereby appeal against the decision of the Court of Revision for the Township of Cornwall rendered on the 25th day of May, 1914, confirming the assessment of the International Bridge between Canada and the United States No. 1295 on the roll and amounting to $300,000 on the ground that the said bridge is not under the provisions of the \u201cAssessment Act\u201d properly assessable at all.\nThe Board met on 23rd September, 1914, when the chairman thereof pointed out, that it had held it had no jurisdiction to hear any such appeal, but only appeals from the county judge, and asked counsel for the present appellant if he intended to raise that objection. Counsel replied he would raise all the objections possible.\nThen a discussion ensued between counsel and the chairman which shews that for some reason or other in the nature of a personal or professional reciprocity the counsel for appellant (then respondent) seemed to assent to trying the matter on its merits and then the following appears of record:\u2014\nMr. Scott: I appreciate the position you take. Then this appeal will be taken as if it had gone before the county judge, and we are appealing against an adverse decision of the county judge.\nThe Chairman: Your contention is that under the provisions of the \u201cAssessment Act,\u201d the property is not assessable? Mr. Scott: Yes, we have no complaint as to the amount.\nMr. Gogo: Before the argument proceeds, I think my learned friend will concede that the railway bridge is not on railway lands.\nMr. Scott: Yes, there is no dispute as to the facts. It is purely a question of law. To begin with, I put in the assessment notice which is addressed to the Ottawa and New York Railway, the New York and Ottawa Railway and the New York Central Lines. There are a number of items on it, but the only one from which we appeal is the assessment of $300,000 on the International Bridge.\n(Assessment notice marked Exhibit No. 1.)\nThe Chairman: This is a copy of the Assessment Roll?\nMr. Scott: Yes, nothing turns on the question of the parties; I represent them all.\nMr. Gogo: There is another question involved in this case, and that is that it is not a railway company who are operating the bridge. The railway company simply have running rights over the bridge.\nMr. Scott: The facts with regard to this bridge are as follows: The bridge was built and is owned by the Ottawa and New York Railway Company under the provisions of certain Acts of Parliament which I have set out in this memorandum that I propose to hand in.\nThe parties proceeded to argue the appeal, and in the course of that argument to state the supposed relevant facts.\nThe memorandum which appellant\u2019s counsel refers to therein I infer was supplied later. That memorandum appears in the case before us and a lease which also appears in the case is before us, but when the latter was introduced does not appear. Inasmuch as the two first exhibits in the record are apparently stamped by the clerk of the board, but the copy of lease in the record is not so marked, I infer it was not before the Board.\nThis argument before the Board appears in the case, apparently, as if taken down by the stenographer of the Board.\nFrom that argument it seems quite clear that counsel for respondents (then appellants) never withdrew the concession he had made, or relied upon anything in what either of law or fact it clearly covers. Apart from that, he took and seemed chiefly to rely upon, the distinct ground, that inasmuch as the bridge in question was over a, navigable river it was, therefore, within the exemption in favour of the railway companies in respect of bridges over public highways. He failed in this contention before the Board, which held that such a public highway as a navigable river was not the kind of highway referred to in the Act, in providing for exemptions from taxation of bridges over highways.\nThe matter is thus stated by the Board:\u2014\nThe exceptions are (1) structures, etc., which are affixed to a highway, street or road merely crossed by a railway, and (2) bridges and tunnels in, out, under or forming part of any highway. Mr. Scott, for the appellants, contends that the River St. Lawrence is a \u201chighway,\u201d that the bridge is over it, and, therefore, exempt under the last named exception; further, the river being such a highway, and being merely crossed by the railway, the bridge (a structure or superstructure) is exempt under the first named exception. To this contention the Board cannot accede.\nThe Board then proceeds to demonstrate why it cannot accede thereto and ends by stating:\u2014\nIt is admitted that sub-section (3) of section 47 has no application, the bridge in question not being on railway lands.\nHence, agreeing with Mr. Justice Britton\u2019s opinion in a previous case[6], between same parties the Board dismissed the appeal.\nIt is quite clear to me not only that the whole submission to the Board was irregular and a something never contemplated by the Act, unless and until the matter had been passed upon by the county judge, after a proper trial which should have elicited and made clear all the relevant facts, but was also a limited submission proceeding upon the elimination of any claim to exemption on the ground of the bridge being on or over railway lands as provided for in section 47, sub-section (3) of the Act.\nIt puzzles one to understand why such a course should have been pursued. Assuming the Board had decided the other way I am at a loss to understand how such a proceeding and possible judgment could have overridden the plain terms of section 70 of the Act as quoted above, making the roll as certified by the clerk, after the Court of Revision, final and binding upon all concerned.\nThe five gentlemen composing the Court of Revision are the same who presumably chose to make that submission. They had no power thus to interfere with the legal product of their own work thus validated by section 70.\nA judgment of the Board under such circumstances was clearly not appealable to the Appellate Divisional Court.\nIt would be difficult to conceive of its being appealable, even if the language providing for an appeal from the Board to the Appellate Division had been much more comprehensive than it is; unless for the limited purpose of having it declared to have been made without jurisdiction.\nMoreover, the appeal provided in assessment cases coming before the Board to the Appellate Division is of a very limited character. It is somewhat analogous to that provided in the way of appeals to this court from the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada. It is limited to questions of jurisdiction and questions of law. Sub-section 6 of section 80 (already referred to) of the \u201cAssessment Act,\u201d provides as follows:\u2014\n(6) An appeal shall lie from the decision of the Board under this section to a Divisional Court upon all questions of law, but such appeal shall not lie unless leave to appeal is given by the said court upon application of any party and upon hearing the parties and the Board.\nThe next sub-section provides for the practice and procedure on such appeals following that prescribed in county court appeals.\nThe whole jurisdiction rests entirely upon section 80 restricted by sub-section 6 just quoted unless, as may be arguable, aided by section 48 of the \u201cOntario Railway and Municipal Board Act,\u201d ch. 186, R.S.O., 1914.\nSub-section 1 of that section seems to give the Divisional Court express power to hear appeals from the Board upon any question of its jurisdiction as well as upon any question of law.\nAs the appeal in any case is only upon leave being given one might have expected the order giving leave to define what is to be dealt with. We get no aid in that regard from the order made herein giving leave.\nSub-section 3 of section 48, aforesaid, provides as follows:\u2014\n(3) On the hearing of any appeal the court may draw all such inferences as are not inconsistent with the facts expressly found by the Board and are necessary for determining the question of jurisdiction or law, as the case may be, and shall certify its opinion to the Board and the Board shall make an order in accordance with such opinion.\nI shall assume for our present purposes that these two sub-sections are applicable to such appeals as contemplated and provided for by sub-section 6 of section 80 of the \u201cAssessment Act.\u201d It is possible by doing so to give that some wider meaning than it might otherwise have in itself, and hence due to the Appellate Division, possibly taking that view to so consider it.\nIn view of the course of the argument herein before us I should not express any definite opinion as to their applicability. I only desire, for argument\u2019s sake, to assume that as far as jurisdiction of the Board came in question that may have been appealable and that inferences of fact, from facts found by the Board, might on such an appeal be drawn.\nThe Appellate Division seems not only to have set aside, or at all events overlooked, the terms of the submission, and proceeded as if the whole of the questions of both law and fact possible to have been originally raised were open for it to deal with, as might be done in an ordinary appeal and that notwithstanding the express concession of counsel as quoted above emphasized by the express statement of the Board also quoted above, and by the meaning evidently attached by him at the time, as the course of his argument before the Board indicates, to the concession he had made.\nI am unable to understand why, under the circumstances, the matter should have been again agitated, or permitted to be so, before the Appellate Division.\nNot only that but further evidence was introduced, a plan was filed, and correspondence between the Registrar of the Court and counsel had, explanatory thereof. As the result of doing so the Appellate Division has discarded the ground taken by respondents, when before the Board as appellants, and adopted the ground deliberately abandoned before the Board, as the basis of an opinion which should, if competent, lead to the Board reversing its judgment.\nWe have not been helped much by anything appearing upon the record to understand such a result as springing from a mere submission by the parties concerned to a tribunal chosen by them, and acting entirely beyond the course defined by statute for such a tribunal to follow, when discharging its statutory duties.\nI am driven to the conclusion that the Appellate Division must have inadvertently overlooked the fact that the Board was acting and could not properly act in any other way than as the result of such a submission, and in such a case its deliverance was not appealable.\nIn such explanation as Mr. Scott offered us he frankly stated that at some stage in the proceedings before the Appellate Division, Mr. Gogo, as counsel for respondent, called attention to the limiting effect of the concession which had been made, and something ensued as result which is not clear. The court has not dealt at all with that aspect of the case.\nMr. Ewart properly declined to enter upon any discussion of the disputed facts upon or in regard to which a misunderstanding (to which he was no party) had evidently arisen, but submitted to us in argument that the question was only one of law and involved no matter of fact.\nFor two reasons I cannot accede to that view. In the first place as already stated, both questions of law and fact were taken and treated by the Board as taken out of the case submitted to them. It is their understanding of what it was they complaisantly had undertaken to decide, which must govern, and I re- spectfully submit ought to have governed all concerned.\nIn the next place it is impossible as the Appellate Division found, to treat the whole question involved as one of law. The course of calling for evidence of fact upon which to proceed puts aside Mr. Ewart\u2019s submission on that head. The basic facts upon which to found and frame any opinion of the law to govern are disputed unless confined to what the Board expressly states was admitted and acted upon by it. There is no room left therein to draw inferences of fact found in the lease and plan filed in the Appellate Division.\nIndeed, the lease alone now appearing in the case, presents many arguable questions of law as to the legal result thereof before applying the provisions therein as fact to the determination of the rights of the parties hereto under the \u201cAssessment Act.\u201d\nThe lease to the holding company is for ninety-nine years and it is by the terms thereof that company which must bear the burden of taxation. And the assessment roll, but for the curative clause already referred to is, l incline to think, defective in form in that connection.\nWhether the contracting parties sought to avoid by the form of the provision in the lease relative to taxes, the claims of direct taxation of the holding company as being more favourable for all concerned than a taxation of the reversions, I know not.\nThen, again, evidently there was in contemplation some improvements and additions to the structures to be made by the holding company and respectively become the respective properties of the leasing companies at the expiration of the term. Are such improvements and additions taxable, and if so against whom?\nI am not concerned with all these things further than to point out the involved nature of the facts to be determined before the \u201cAssessment Act\u201d can be properly applied. And I express no opinion upon their effect in that regard.\nI may be permitted, however, most respectfully to suggest, from what appears in the case, that if the Appellate Division had refused, as I submit it should have done, to entertain such an irregular appeal, the facts might have been better ascertained by the investigation in due course of law before the county judge and then and thereafter fully considered and given due effect to.\nThese considerations, moreover, suggest to me that the Appellate Division so far as it did go into an examination of the facts, went beyond its jurisdiction which was confined by the very terms of the Act enabling it to entertain any appeal to mere questions of law, even if the case could otherwise have been held appealable.\nThe case thus presented for our consideration in appeal is clearly one in which we cannot deal with the merits.\nIt falls in principle within what the House of Lords had to consider in the case of Burgess v. Morton[7]. There the court had determined, at the request of the parties, upon a submission to the said court of an imperfectly stated case, and thereupon an appellate court had heard an appeal from such determination on the like material and the House of Lords declined to go into the merits and confined itself to declaring that the Appellate Court had no jurisdiction and to reverse it accordingly.\nThere are numerous cases upon the subject, but this one seems in principle, in its essential features, as nearly on all fours, as one might expect to find, with what happened and is involved herein.\nBut the question that has puzzled me most and in which we have not been able to elicit assistance from counsel is whether or not this court can be said to stand in relation to the courts below in the same position as the House of Lords stood in that case and numerous others to the courts appealed from.\nWe must never forget that we are not, as the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench formerly in England was, and its successors still are, possessed of an inherent jurisdiction in many ways to keep other courts within the limits of the jurisdiction assigned them.\nOur duties in this case are confined within the terms of section 41 of the \u201cSupreme Court Act,\u201d as follows:\u2014\nAn appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court from the judgment of any court of last resort created under provincial legislation to adjudicate concerning the assessment of property for provincial or municipal purposes, in cases where the person or persons presiding over such court is or are by provincial or municipal authority authorized to adjudicate, and the judgment appealed from involves the assessment of property at a value of not less than ten thousand dollars. 52 Vict., ch. 37, sec. 2.\nIt is quite clear that the Appellate Division is a court of last resort and answers all the requirements of the section in any ordinary case involving an assessment of not less than ten thousand dollars.\nDo the words, in cases where the person or persons presiding over such court is or are by provincial or municipal authority authorized to adjudicate,\neliminate such a case as this?\nAt first blush it seems incongruous for us to hold by virtue only of this section that the court appealed from had no jurisdiction and that we are entitled not only to so hold as a matter of opinion, but also to reverse on that ground.\nThough counsel were invited to consider the section and aid us in regard to its construction no one has remarked upon this difficulty, and I, therefore, am content to assume the difficulty I suggest as possibly in our way does not exist. Inded, we have heard no argument on the section, though it was invited.\nI have also observed since the argument the use in said section of the words \u201cor municipal\u201d therein which suggest the possibility of municipalities in some of the provinces being empowered by statute to submit to the court of last resort in the province a question needing determination. I know of none in Ontario and assume if any other power given than what I have referred to it would have been cited.\nI may also add that I have considered whether the mere power to express an opinion can be held an authority \u201cto adjudicate\u201d within the meaning of the words of the section. I conceive so, if the opinion is intended to be imperative when confined as it ought to be to a question of law, and hence there may be herein an adjudication within the meaning of the section.\nMoreover, on due reflection, the authorization dealt with in these words is that over the subject matter involved in the section as a whole, and not only over such merely incidental matter as arising in its application. Many variations of that which has occurred herein or of an accidental excess of the jurisdiction of the court might in course of time arise. It would seem as if to give effect to any of the objections I suggest might be too much in line with the microscopical method of analyzing a statute and thereby laying a foundation for frittering it away instead of fitting the whole to what it was intended for. In this case the attempting to do so would disappoint what I think was the evident purpose of Parliament in assigning to us the jurisdiction it has by the enactment in section 41.\nAssuredly neither the formal judgment nor the opinion judgment gives us any right to assume that the Appellate Division imagined it was acting upon or pursuant to a submission by consent to obtain its opinion, or doing anything but determining as the court of last resort in a province what it supposed it had power to determine.\nI do not see how we can escape from declaring our opinion that it is because of the incompetency of the Appellate Division to review and in effect reverse the Board that we are debarred from examining the case on its merits and as a logical result must give as far as we can effect to such opinion.\nSuch a mode of dealing with appeals calling in question the jurisdiction of the court appealed from by merely expressing an opinion that the court below had no jurisdiction was in vogue in Ontario (then Upper Canada) at an early date. See the remarks of Chief Justice Hagarty speaking for the Queen\u2019s Bench in Ferguson v. Township of Howick[8], at page 553, in the year 1866. The later development of the law in Ontario appears in Howard v. Herrington[9], aided, I think, then by legislative enactment.\nIt seems to me that we should not only declare the Appellate Division incompetent to pass upon the judgment of the Board, but also give the judgment that court should have given. To do so is to reverse its judgment.\nThere is a question suggested by the case of Bickett v. Morris[10], and the course of appellant in the court below. In that case the judge ordinary deviated from the cursus curi\u0153 and the party against whom he had decided appealed and succeeded, whereupon the unsuccessful party appealed to the House of Lords when the objection of assent was taken. The court held it was not disabled from pronouncing judgment. Though it was intimated that if the pursuer had been appealing his doing so might have been an answer to him, but not to one who had not acquiesced.\nI cannot say that appellant acquiesced for its counsel raised the objection, though perhaps he did not take as determined a stand as some others might have done. Indeed, I doubt much if it ever was competent for the present appellants to acquiesce in anything depriving or tending to deprive the municipality of its taxes to which its legal right was established by the \u201cAssessment Act\u201d until the liability of appellant therefor had been got rid of by due course of law.\nIn view of both parties having pursued the course taken in this case, I do not think costs should be allowed. The only justification for such litigation as has been followed herein might be the hope of a final and binding decision upon the questions raised and that was hopeless from the start if due regard had been had to the recognized state of the law.\nIn any result got or likely to be got it would not bind either party in future years. Indeed, even as to the year involved herein such a decision as either the Board or Appellate Division or this court might render as against the appellant might be tested by litigation rested upon the prior validation of the roll by the \u201cAssessment Act\u201d and the result in the Court of Revision.\nI, therefore, think the appeal should be allowed on the ground that the court appealed from had no jurisdiction to pronounce the judgment it did or award the costs awarded.\nDUFF J.\u2014This appeal concerns the assessability under the provisions of the \u201cOntario Assessment Act\u201d (R.S.O., ch. 195, secs. 47 and 48) of part of a railway bridge owned and occupied by the respondents, the Ottawa and New York Railway Co., crossing the St. Lawrence River near Cornwall. Part of this bridge is within the territorial limits of the Township of Cornwall and was entered in the assessment roll for the year 1914 of the appellant township and assessed at the sum of $300,000.\nBefore coming to the merits of the question of the legality of the assessment there are two technical points which it will be convenient to consider together. The first concerns the competence of the present appeal, or, as I prefer to put it, the appealability of the judgment of the Court of Appeal; and the second is the question whether assuming that judgment to be appealable to this court, it ought to be reversed on the ground that in the particular circumstances in which it was pronounced, the Court of Appeal had no authority to give judgment on the validity of an assessment under the statutory enactment or enactments, sec. 80, \u201cAssessment Act,\u201d ch. 95, R.S.O., 1914; sec. 48, \u201cRailway and Municipal Board Act,\u201d ch. 186, R.S.O., 1914, under which it professed to act because the essential statutory prerequisites of that authority were wanting.\nThe proceedings must be briefly noticed. The respondent gave notice of appeal from the assessment to the Court of Revision, and on that appeal the assessment was Confirmed. No notice of appeal to the county court judge was given under section 72 of the \u201cAssessment Act,\u201d but on the 25th of May, 1914, the respondent gave notice of appeal direct from the Court of Revision to the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board, and on the 7th October of the same year judgment was pronounced dismissing the appeal. On the 4th of December, 1914, leave was obtained by the respondent to appeal to the Appellate Division under section 80 of the \u201cAssessment Act,\u201d and on this appeal judgment was pronounced on the 26th of April, 1915, declaring the assessment to be invalid. Both parties appear to have concurred in the view that as the right of appeal expressly given by the \u201cAssessment Act\u201d to the Railway and Municipal Board was a right of appeal from a decision of a county court judge pronounced under the authority of section 72, and that the respondents could not without the consent of the appellant municipality bring the question disputed between them before the Board by way of direct appeal from the Court of Revision; at the same time they appear also to have concurred in the view that the objection to the competence of such an appeal direct could be effectively waived by the appellant municipality.\nThe objection was waived and the Board acting obviously on the view of the parties that the effect of the waiver was to bring the provisions of section 80 of the \u201cAssessment Act\u201d into play just as if there had been a judgment by the county court judge and they were hearing an appeal from that judgment, heard the appeal and pronounced judgment in favour of the municipality dismissing the appeal on the merits.\nIt is now said against the appellant municipality that this order was not an order of the Board pronounced in exercise of its statutory jurisdiction and consequently that it was not appealable to the Court of Appeal under section 80 of the \u201cAssessment Act,\u201d or section 48 of the \u201cOntario Municipal and Railway Board Act\u201d; and that in consequence the judgment of the Court of Appeal must be deemed to have been a judgment pronounced in an appeal heard pursuant to a directio personarun and not in exercise of any authority given by law with the result, of course, that it is not appealable to this court on the authority of Burgess v. Morton[11], and the decisions referred to in the judgments of the Law Lords in that case. While on behalf of the appellant municipality it is said that the judgment of the Court of Appeal declaring the assessment in question invalid was a judgment which the Court of Appeal had no legal authority to pronounce; because the authority of the Court of Appeal in respect of such matters arises only when there is an appeal before that court from an order made by the Board in a proceeding in which the Board itself would have had authority to deal with an assessment by pronouncing it valid or invalid, and that the Board in this instance had no such authority because the objection referred to above going to the statutory conditions of the Board\u2019s authority was an objection of the kind that cannot be waived. The judgment of the Court of Appeal nevertheless, it was argued on behalf of the appellant municipality, is a judgment of a court of general jurisdiction having inter alia authority\u2014certain conditions being satisfied\u2014to pronounce a judgment of the character of that now appealed from; that the judgment necessarily involves a decision that the conditions of jurisdiction existed, a decision appealable to this court as being a judgment of a court of last resort in an assessment matter within the meaning of section 41 of the \u201cSupreme Court Act.\u201d\nI have no difficulty in holding that the appeal lies. The judgment of the Court of Appeal is ex facie a judgment pronounced in an appeal regularly before the court after leave given under section 80 of the \u201cAssessment Act.\u201d There is not a suggestion in the formal judgment, in the reasons for judgment, in the order giving leave to appeal that the court was acting otherwise than in the normal course. It must, therefore, be taken in the absence of evidence to the contrary, and there is none, that the appeal was heard and judgment was pronounced in the ordinary course of jurisdiction.\nThat being so the point as to the appealability of this judgment is, I think, disposed of by the judgment of the Court of Appeal in an appeal from a winding-up order made in exercise of the jurisdiction given by the \u201cCompanies Act, 1862.\u201d In re Padstow Total Loss and Collision Assurance Association[12]. At page 142, Sir Geo. Jessel M.R. puts the matter in a sentence:\u2014\nThe first point to be considered is whether, assuming that the association was an unlawful one, and that the court had no jurisdiction to make the order, an appeal is the proper mode of getting rid of that order. I think that it is. I think that an order made by a court of competent jurisdiction which has authority to decide as to its own competency must be taken to he a decision by the court that it has jurisdiction to make the order, and consequently you may appeal from it on the ground that such decision is erroneous.\nIn this conection three other decisions may usefully be referred to. In Pisani v. Attorney\u2011General for Gibraltar[13] it was in substance held that even where there was a deviation from the cursus curi\u0153 unless there was an attempt to give the court a jurisdiction which it did not possess or a strain upon its procedure putting it so entirely out of its course that the decision could not properly be reviewed, such a departure does not deprive either party of the right of appeal. I refer particularly to the judgment of Sir Montague Smith at page 522.\nThen there is Morris v. Davies[14], the effect of which is summarized in Sir Montague Smith\u2019s judgment at page 524. A new trial having been ordered, Lord Lyndhurst instead of sending the case back to a jury by consent of the parties heard and disposed of it himself. In the House of Lords the objection taken to the competence of an appeal from Lord Lyndhurst\u2019s decision was rejected by their Lordships on the ground that it was never intended that Lord Lyndhurst should try the case otherwise than as a judge or that it was not to go on subject to all the incidents of a cause regularly heard in court, including an appeal, if the parties so desired.\nIn Low v. General Steam Fishing Co.[15] the House of Lords had to consider the appealability of a judgment by the Second Division of the Court of Session, in these circumstances. On the hearing of a claim under the \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation Act\u201d by a sheriff substitute, the sheriff substitute refused to state a case upon a question which was afterwards held to be a question of law. On appeal, the Second Division after intimating their view that the arbitrator was bound to state a case suggested that counsel should concur in a minute, the effect of which was that the case should be disposed of by the Second Division as if upon a case stated by sheriff substitute in terms of the statute, which was accordingly done. On appeal it was held by their Lordships that what was done merely amounted to an abbreviation of procedure and was not such a departure from the cursus curi\u0153 as to deprive the parties of their appeal. In the first and fourth of these cases it may be noted that the jurisdiction in dispute was a special statutory jurisdiction.\nThe contention of the appellant municipality presents a more difficult question. The first step is to consider the character of the order of the Board. There is sufficient evidence in the form of the order itself and in the reasons for judgment that the order was intended to be and was pronounced in exercise of the corporate authority of the Board. The members of the Board were not as individuals arbitrating in a matter before them by consent; the order was pronounced upon a matter in respect of which it must be assumed they held themselves to have jurisdiction by reason of the fact that the objection above referred to had been waived.\nThe view of the Board and of the parties was that waiver by the appellant municipality of the objection that no appeal lies to the Board from the Court of Revision per saltum and consent that the appeal should be treated as an appeal from the county judge was sufficient to give the Board power to grant the relief asked in exercise of its statutory authority; and it is manifest that the court of appeal treated the appeal before them as an appeal in the ordinary course, and that they had no thought of exercising a jurisdiction resting upon consent alone.\nIn the view I take it is unnecessary to say whether or not the Board rightly decided that the objection to the appeal could be overcome by waiver. I have no difficulty in holding that by its conduct in concurring with the respondent company\u2019s invitation to the Board to hold that the objection could be waived and in taking part in the appeal to the court of appeal which followed without objection the appellant municipality has precluded itself from contending on this appeal that the decision of the Board upon the point of competence was erroneous.\nTwo considerations weighing against this view have to be examined. First, it is said to be a case for the application of the maxim consent cannot give juris- diction. This, of course, simply begs the question. Consent can give jurisdiction when it consists only in waiver of a condition which the law permits to be waived, otherwise it cannot. Where want of jurisdiction touches the subject matter of the controversy or where the proceeding is of a kind which by law or custom has been appropriated to another tribunal then mere consent of the parties is inoperative. No consent, for example, could give the Supreme Court of Ontario jurisdiction to hear a petition for determining the right to a seat in Parliament. But the question before us is not whether the consent of the municipality did in point of law give the Board jurisdiction, but whether the municipality having concurred with the respondents in asking the Board to hold that such was the effect of consent, and the Board having so held and acted upon its holding, and the municipality having taken chances of a favourable decision by the Board, and by the court of appeal on that footing, can now, on appeal, dispute the Board\u2019s decision on the point of jurisdiction. Generally speaking, where the proceeding is of a character appropriate to a tribunal which has, in given conditions, jurisdiction over the subject matter and is competent to decide the question whether such conditions can be waived, it is competent to the parties to agree to recognize the validity of the tribunal\u2019s judgment and thereby (if the tribunal decide that it may act upon such an agreement and do so) to preclude themselves from raising afterwards the objection that, in the particular case, some condition of jurisdiction was wanting in fact.\nReverting to the case before us, the question brought before the Board was in itself precisely the kind of question which it would be the Board\u2019s duty to determine under section 80 of the \u201cAssessment Act,\u201d and the object of the parties in omitting what in the circumstances they no doubt, without any disrespect regarded as the formality of an appeal to the county court judge was, to use an expression taken from a reported case to which I have referred, merely the abbreviating procedure and saving expense. The effect of such an agreement has been considered in a number of cases, to some of which it will be useful to refer. In Forrest v. Harvey[16], the House of Lords had to consider the effect of a defendant appearing before the Magistrates of Leith in answer to an application under a statute conferring jurisdiction with respect to small debts. It was admitted that the jurisdiction of the magistrate might have been successfully objected to on the ground of non-observance of certain essential formalities, and the principal question their Lordships had to consider was whether this defect had been cured by waiver. Lord Brougham appears to have taken the view, although it was not strictly necessary to the decision that the defect could not have been cured by any agreement to waive the objection, and Lord Cottenham agreed that the mere failure to take the objection at the earliest moment was not an answer to it. Lord Cottenham and Lord Campbell; however, concurred in holding that the parties might contract together in such a way as to prevent them disputing the competence of a tribunal which had assumed jurisdiction, although some otherwise essential statutory condition of jurisdiction were wanting. In Ex parte Pratt[17], at p. 341, the same principle, the primary court being a superior court, is expressed by Lord Justice Bowen in these words:\u2014\nThere is a good old-fashioned rule that no one has a right so to conduct himself before a tribunal as if he accepted its jurisdiction, and then afterwards, when he finds that it has decided against him, to turn round and say, \u201cYou have no jurisdiction.\u201d You ought not to lead a tribunal to exercise jurisdiction wrongfully.\nIt is not disputed that there was an express agreement between the municipality and the respondents to submit the point of competence to the judgment of the Board; to invite the Board to hold that it had jurisdiction; and I think the proper conclusion is that it is not open to the appellant municipality to raise by way of appeal this objection which I am now considering.\nThe second point touches the effect of the \u201cOntario Assessment Act\u201d and the \u201cRailway and Municipal Board Act.\u201d It is said that the effect of section 70 of the \u201cAssessment Act\u201d is that the assessment roll is binding as finally passed by the Court of Revision except as altered on appeal to the judge of the county court and that this provision in fact forbids any exercise of jurisdiction by the Board or the court of appeal in the absence of an appeal to the county court.\nI agree that if on the true construction of those statutes an agreement not to dispute the jurisdiction of the Board in the circumstances in question here is in conflict with the policy of the law, effect cannot be given to such an agreement. I do not think such is the effect of the statutes.\nThe provisions of the \u201cRailway and Municipal Board Act\u201d and the \u201cAssessment Act\u201d relating to the powers and character of the Board as a tribunal evidence an intention on the part of the legislature that the Board should have jurisdiction, subject to review, to pass upon any question whether as regards any appeal touching a subject-matter within its competence the conditions precedent of its authority had been fulfilled.\nThe following provisions are relevant:\u2014\nR.S.O., ch. 186, 1914.\nSec. 5, sub-sec. 4.\u2014The Board shall have all the powers of a Court of Record and shall have an official seal which shall be judicially noticed.\nSec. 5, sub-sec. 5(b).\u2014The Chairman of the Board, if at the time of his appointment a barrister of at least ten years\u2019 standing at the bar. shall not be removed at any time by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, except upon an address of the Assembly.\nSec. 7.\u2014Whenever in any Act it is provided that any railway company shall, during construction of any line of railway, furnish such information as to the location and plans of passenger or freight stations as may from time to time be required by the Lieutenant\u2011Governor or any of his Ministers, or that such company shall comply with any directions that may be given for the erection of stations or the number of them, such information shall be furnished to the Board and its directions shall be complied with by the company. 3-4 Geo. V., ch. 37, sec. 5.\nSec. 21, sub-sec. 3.\u2014The Board shall, as to all matters within its jurisdiction, have authority to hear and determine all questions of law or of fact.\nSec. 21, sub-sec. 4.\u2014The Board shall, as respects the amendment of proceedings, the attendance and examination of witnesses, the production and inspection of documents, the enforcement of its orders, the entry on and inspection of property, and other matters necessary or proper for the due exercise of its jurisdiction, or otherwise for carrying this Act or any other general or special Act into effect, have all such powers, rights and privileges as are vested in the Supreme Court.\nSec. 22.\u2014The Board shall have exclusive jurisdiction in all cases and in respect of all matters in which jurisdiction is conferred on it by this Act or by any other general or special Act. 3-4 Geo. V., ch. 37, sec. 22.\nSec. 38.\u2014(1) A certified copy of any order or decision made by the Board under this Act or any general or special Act may be filed in the office of the Clerk of Records and writs, and shall thereupon become and be enforceable as a judgment or order of the Supreme Court to the same effect, but the order or decision may be nevertheless rescinded or varied by the Board.\n(2) It shall be optional with the Board to adopt the method provided by this section for enforcing its orders or decisions or to enforce them by its own action. 3-4 Geo. V., ch. 37, sec. 38.\nSec. 43.\u2014The Board may make general rules regulating its practice and procedure. 3-4 Geo. V., ch. 37, sec. 43.\nSec. 48(1).\u2014An appeal shall lie from the Board to a Divisional Court upon a question of jurisdiction or upon any question of law, but such appeal shall not lie unless leave to appeal is obtained from the court within one month after the making of the order or decision sought to be appealed from or within such further time as the court, under the special circumstances of the case, shall allow after notice to the opposite party stating the grounds of appeal.\nSec. 48, sub-sec. (8).\u2014Save as provided in section 47,\n(a) Every decision or order of the Board shall be final; and\n(b) No order, decision or proceeding of the Board shall be questioned or reviewed, restrained or removed by prohibition, injunction, certiorari or any other process or proceeding in any court. 3-4 Geo. V., ch. 37, sec. 48.\n\u201cAssessment Act,\u201d ch. 195, R.S.O. 1914.\nSec. 80(5).\u2014The Board shall have power upon such appeal to decide not only as to the amount at which the property in question shall be assessed, but also all questions as to whether any persons or things are liable to assessment or exempt from assessment under the provisions of this Act.\n(6) An appeal shall lie from the decision of the Board under this section to a Divisional Court upon all questions of law, but such appeal shall not lie unless leave to appeal is given by the said court upon application of any party and upon hearing the parties and the Board.\nSection 21, sub-section 4, indicates an intention on the part of the legislature that it should be the duty of the Board to decide whether or not the conditions essential to its jurisdiction as regards any subject-matter within its competence have or have not been fulfilled, and I think the proper conclusion having regard to the quoted provisions as a whole, is, for all relevant purposes, independently of section 48, sub-section 8(b), that a decision of the Board upon such a question is equivalent to a decision of a superior court. In so far as the decision relates to a question of fact it is final, in so far as it depends upon questions of law, then an appeal lies under section 48. It is not necessary to decide whether section 48, sub-section 8(b), applies to orders made by the Board in professed exercise of the jurisdiction given by some statute other than the \u201cRailway and Municipal Board Act.\u201d It is clear to my mind that a decision of the Board that the conditions of jurisdiction under section 80 of the \u201cAssessment Act\u201d have been observed, in so far as it is not a decision upon a mere question of fact, is a decision upon a question of law within that section and appealable as such. In these circumstances I see no reason why the parties to an appeal may not competently contract to accept the judgment of the Board on any such question as final; and, if so, it would follow that a party inviting the Board to find on a certain state of facts that it had jurisdiction to deal with a subject-matter which is in given conditions within the cognizance of the Board and having had the advantage of the Board\u2019s decision that it had jurisdiction by getting a hearing on the merits of a question which it desired to have disposed of, could not afterwards be heard to say by way of appeal that the facts did not exist which were necessary in point of law to give the Board jurisdiction.\nGandy v. Gandy[18], at page 82; Roe v. The Mutual Loan Fund[19]. See Everest & Strode, \u201cEstoppel.\u201d\nIs the bridge assessable under sections 47 and 48 of the \u201cOntario Assessment Act?\u201d It is convenient to set out the first of these enactments in full. Section 47 as follows:\u2014\n47. (1).\u2014Every steam railway company shall annually transmit on or before the first day of February to the clerk of every municipality in which any part of the roadway or other real property of the company is situate, a statement shewing:\u2014\n(a) The quantity of land occupied by the roadway, and the actual value thereof (according to the average value of land in the locality) as rated on the assessment roll of the previous year;\n(b) The vacant land not in actual use by the company and the value thereof;\n(c) The quantity of land occupied by the railway and being part of the highway, street, road or other public land (but not being a highway, street or road which is merely crossed by the line of railway) and the assessable value as hereinafter mentioned of all the property belonging to or used by the company upon, in, over, under, or affixed to the same;\n(d) The real property, other than aforesaid, in actual use and occupation by the company, and its assessable value as hereinafter mentioned; and the clerk of the municipality shall communicate such statement to the assessor. 4 Edw. VII., ch. 23, sec. 44 (1).\n(2) The assessor shall assess the land and property aforesaid as follows:\u2014\n(a) The roadway or right of way at the actual value thereof according to the average value of land in the locality; but not including the structures, sub-structures and superstructures, rails, ties, poles and other property thereon;\n(b) The said vacant land, and its value as other vacant lands are assessed under this Act;\n(c) The structures, sub-structures, superstructures, rails, ties, poles, and other property belonging to or used by the company (not including rolling stock and not including tunnels or bridges in, over, under, or forming part of any highway), upon, in, over, under or affixed to any highway, street or road (not being a highway, street or road merely crossed by the line of railway) at their actual cash value as the same would be appraised upon a sale to another company possessing similar powers, rights and franchises, regard being had to all circumstances adversely affecting the value, including the non-user of such property; and\n(d) The real property not designated in clauses (a), (b) and (c) of this sub-section in actual use and occupation by the company, at its actual cash value as the same would be appraised upon a sale to another company possessing similar powers, rights and franchises. 4 Edw. VII., ch. 23, sec. 44(2).\n(3) Notwithstanding anything in this Act contained, the structures, sub-structures, superstructures, rails, ties, poles, wires and other property on railway lands and used exclusively for railway purposes or incidental thereto (except stations, freight sheds, offices, warehouses, elevators, hotels, roundhouses and machine repair and other shops) shall not be assessed. 6 Edw. VII., ch. 36, sec. 13.\n(4) The assessor shall deliver at, or transmit by post to, any station or office of the company a notice, addressed to the company, of the total amount at which he has assessed the said land and property of the company in his municipality or ward shewing the amount for each description of property mentioned in the above statement of the company; and such statement and notice respectively shall be held to be the assessment return and notice of assessment required by sections 18 and 49.\n(5) A railway company assessed under this section shall be exempt from assessment in any other manner for municipal purposes except for local improvements. 4 Edw. VII., ch. 23, sec. 44(3-4).\nThese provisions are perhaps a little wanting in precision, but one thing is not doubtful, and that is that \u201cstructures, substructures and superstructures\u201d on \u201cthe roadway or right-of-way\u201d are not assessable; it being understood that this does not apply to \u201cstructures, substructures and superstructures * * * upon, in, over, under or affixed to any highway, street or road\u201d except in the case of a mere crossing. It is also clear that all such \u201cstructures, sub-structures and superstructures\u201d which are on \u201crailway lands\u201d and are used exclusively for railway purposes or incidental thereto are (with certain exceptions not material at present) not assessable. By sub-section 5(h) of the interpretation section (section 2), all structures and fixtures\nerected or placed upon, in, over, under or affixed to any highway, lane or other public communication or water,\nare comprehended under the word \u201cland.\u201d It was admitted on the hearing before the Board by the respondents that the part of the bridge, the assessment of which is now in question, is supported by piers resting on the bed of the St. Lawrence River, which is the property of the Crown; and I propose to consider the construction and application of the Act in view of this admission of fact and afterwards to discuss the point made on behalf of the appellant municipality that the admission was of such a character as to preclude the respondent from invoking sub-section 3 of section 47 for any purpose whatever. I should add, however, that it seems to me to be perfectly clear that both parties intended that the hearing before the Board should proceed and that the hearing did proceed upon the assumption that the bridge is lawfully where it is.\nIn these circumstances, I have reached the conclusion that on this question of the assessability of the bridge the appellant municipality must fail. It is a long settled rule that a given subject is not to be held to be a subject of taxation unless the intention to include it among the (Subjects of taxation is expressed in \u201cclear and unambiguous language.\u201d\nOriental Bank Corporation v. Wright[20], at p. 856; Simms v. Registrar of Probates[21], at p. 337.\nThe rule is so well settled and so well known that it is right to read every taxing Act on the assumption that it has been framed in view of the rule. I am not disposed to go so far as to say that the intention to exclude such property as that in question is clearly expressed in section 47. But on the other hand \u201crailway\u201d in my judgment in sub-section 2(a) is capable of being read as including a viaduct resting by piers upon land occupied solely under authority of a licence to occupy, and if it be right to read it in that broad sense there can be no question that this bridge is excluded by the last sentence of that clause. Nor have I any doubt (having regard to the part of the interpretation section quoted above) that sub-section 3 of section 47 can reasonably be read as extending to structures such as this bridge.\nThese views of these provisions are not free from objection; but it is sufficient to find that, on a reasonable construction of the enactment upon which the appellant municipality relies, the bridge is excluded. That is sufficient on the principle above indicated for holding it to be non\u2011assessable. And that is the conclusion to which, I think, effect should be given.\nI must add a word upon the effect of the admission made before the Board. Counsel who appeared for the respondent company assumed that sub-section 3 had no application to the question before the Board and said so. In this he was a little precipitate. But reading the proceedings as a whole I am quite convinced that it would be doing him an injustice to construe what was said during the course of the argument by him as amounting to an agreement (as one of the terms of the consent for the hearing of the appeal) that consideration of sub-section 3 should he entirely eliminated.\nIt is quite plain, I think, that the admission went to the point of fact and to that only, that the piers supporting the bridge rested on the bed of the river which was public property. I do not think that anybody was misled by that admission into thinking that counsel was conceding that the bridge was wrongfully there or that he was consenting to a hearing of the appeal upon that footing; and I see no reason to suppose, and I cannot suppose, that counsel for the appellant municipality assumed that any such consent was being given. I entirely agree with Mr. Watson that the court ought not to tolerate any attempt, if such an attempt were made, to recede from the admission of fact which undoubtedly was given whatever the consequences might be; but giving full effect to that admission fairly construed from the point of view of both parties, I can see nothing which precludes us from considering and giving effect to sub-section 3 upon the basis of fact above indicated.\nIn the result I think the appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014At the threshold of this appeal we are confronted by two questions of jurisdiction\u2014one a question of the jurisdiction of the Appellate Division raised by the appellants; the other a question of the jurisdiction of this court, raised not by the respondents but by the court itself.\nIn Re Ontario and Minnesota Power Company and The Town of Fort Frances[22], the Appellate Division, on the 27th November, 1914, held that the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board had no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal brought to it directly from a court of revision. In that case the question of jurisdiction arose on an application for leave to appeal, made under R.S.O., 1914, ch. 195, sec. 80, sub-sec. 6 (then 3 & 4 Geo. V., ch. 46, sec 13), from the decision of the Board that an appeal did not lie to it directly from the Court of Revision.\nIn the present case, decided in the Appellate Division on the 26th April, 1915, leave had been sought and obtained for an appeal, and, although the fact that the appeal to the Railway Board had been taken directly from the Court of Revision appeared on the face of the order of the Board and cannot conceivably have escaped the attention of the Appellate Court, it proceeded to hear the appeal and to deal with it, so far as the certificate of its judgment shews, in the ordinary course, as from a decision of the Board made in the exercise of its jurisdiction under section 80 of the \u201cAssessment Act\u201d Why? Certainly neither because the court had forgotten that within six months it had affirmed the decision of the Railway Board that no appeal lay to it directly from the Court of Revision, nor because it meant to reverse that recent judgment without alluding to it. That is to me inconceivable. Then why? Either because the court regarded the consent or waiver upon which the Board had proceeded as involving an agreement that its decision should be subject to an appeal to the Appellate Division\u2014that court thus itself proceeding by consent; or because, applying the ratio of the decision in Morris v. Davies[23], and giving effect to the consent or waiver according to the intention of the parties, it allowed it to operate so as to make the decision of the Board regular and subject to the right of appeal conferred by the statute. That such a consent may be given that effect was the basis of the decision of the Judicial Committee in Pisani v. Attorney-General for Gibraltar[24], at pages 521 et seq.\nIf the Appellate Division proceeded upon the former assumption its opinion as certified would not be a\njudgment of the court of last resort within section 41 of the \u201cSupreme Court Act.\u201d Its validity and binding effect would depend wholly upon the consent on which it was based; it would not be for any purpose appealable to this court; and this appeal should be quashed.\nBut if the Appellate Division had proceeded by consent that fact would almost certainly have appeared on the face of the certificate of its judgment. The certificate is silent as to consent and is in the form usual upon appeals from the Railway Board. It would, therefore, seem to me more probable that the court dealt with the order of the Board as appealable to it under section 80 of the \u201cAssessment Act.\u201d As already pointed out it cannot have made the mistake of considering that the Board had jurisdiction apart from consent or waiver to entertain an appeal directly from the Court of Revision. It follows that, if the Appellate Division did not itself proceed by consent, it must have deemed the question of jurisdiction concluded.\nBut, it may be said, the jurisdiction of the Appellate Division was purely statutory and the principle of the judgments in Morris v. Davies[25], and Pisani v. Attorney-General for Gibraltar[26], is inapplicable. Without at all acceding to that contention, if it be sound, the parties having both acquiesced in that court hearing and disposing of the appeal to it in the exercise of its curial function, and not as a body proceeding by consent only and discharging the function of quasi-arbitrators, upon the principle of the decision in Bickett v. Morris[27], there is a personal bar against either of them taking the ground, whether for the purpose of entirely precluding an appeal to this court, or of preventing an appeal upon the merits, that the decision of the Appellate Division is not a final\njudgment of the court of last resort in the province,\nmade in the exercise of its jurisdiction under section 80 of the \u201cAssessment Act,\u201d and, therefore, appealable to this court under section 41 of the \u201cSupreme Court Act.\u201d That this court has jurisdiction to entertain this appeal, if only for the purpose of determining that the judgment of the Appellate Division was pronounced without jurisdiction, is the appellants\u2019 contention. But upon the authority of Bickett v. Morris[28] they cannot be heard to urge that ground of appeal. If the Appellate Division proceeded by consent, there would be no appeal whatever from its order; if it did not proceed by consent, its judgment is subject to appeal and, its jurisdiction not being open to question, the appeal must be disposed of on the merits.\nSection 48 of the \u201cOntario Railway and Municipal Board Act\u201d in my opinion has no application to appeals under section 80 of the \u201cAssessment Act.\u201d If it had, its 8th sub-section would have concluded against the appellants the question of jurisdiction raised by them.\nOn the merits I agree that the authorization by Parliament, in the exercise of the paramount jurisdiction conferred upon it in regard to railways extending beyond the limits of a province, of the construction of the bridge in question not only renders the occupation by it of the land upon and over which it is erected lawful, but vests in the railway company owning the bridge such an interest in that land that it may be deemed for the purpose of sub-section 3 of section 47 of the \u201cAssessment Act\u201d (R.S.O., 1914, ch. 195), railway land upon which a superstructure is erected, and that such superstructure is, therefore, exempt from assessment.\nIt was very strongly argued either that it was made a condition of the consent of counsel for the municipality to the Railway Board hearing the appeal to it from the Court of Revision, that the appeal should be dealt with on the footing, or that there was an admission of counsel for the railway company binding upon his clients, that the bridge in question does not stand on railway lands. So far as such a condition can be established, it must be strictly observed; so far as any such admission is an admission of fact it is undoubtedly conclusive. But a mere admission upon a matter of law is equally clearly not binding, and, if erroneous, may, and should, be ignored by the court.\nAn examination of the record makes it clear that counsel for the municipality did not ask for, and counsel for the company did not assent to, any such admission being made as a condition of the Board proceeding to hear the appeal as if it had been brought from a decision of the county judge. The question of jurisdiction owing to the appeal having been brought directly from the Court of Revision having been raised, the following discussion ensued:\u2014\nThe Chairman: This point has been up in two or three cases and I do not see any other interpretation that can be given to the statute. The procedure is apparently clear; there must be an appeal from the Court of Revision to the county judge or district judge, and then from the judge to this Board. The notice of appeal to this Board is dated 24th of May, 1914. Mr. Scott: I was ready to come here and have this tried on the 3rd June, and it was adjourned to accommodate my learned friend.\nMr. Gogo: I do not want to take any advantage.\nMr. Scott: When I did that to accommodate you, you should not take advantage of the position now.\nMr. Gogo: I would rather fight the matter out on its merits.\nMr. Scott: You were served with a written notice of our intention to appeal, and surely that can be amended and made as an appeal to the county judge.\nMr. Gogo: If you think you are in any way prejudiced, I will concede your right, and we can go on now.\nMr. Scott: I think that would be a fair thing to do. It is a solicitor\u2019s slip and the matter will have to be tried out sooner or later.\nMr. Gogo: I am willing to have it tried out now.\nMr. Scott: I appreciate the position you take. Then this appeal will be taken as if it had gone before the county judge, and we are appealing against an adverse decision of the county judge.\nThe Chairman: Your contention is that under the provisions of the \u201cAssessment Act,\u201d the property is not assessable?\nNo doubt counsel for the company almost immediately afterwards stated that he\nconceded that the railway bridge is not on railway lands;\nadding, however,\nthere is no dispute as to the facts; it is purely a question of law.\nLater on he said:\u2014\nThere may be some portions of the bridge on our lands, but the whole bridge is over the St. Lawrence River * * * a public river;\nand again:\u2014\nThe test is not whether it is on railway lands. We are there with the permission of the Crown, and to that extent I suppose we are rightfully there. Undoubtedly the title is in the Crown; it is a public river that we are crossing, but it may be said to be public railway land.\nFinally he said.\nsub-section 3 (of section 47) does not apply.\nThe only admission in all this that is binding is that the bridge is over the St. Lawrence River and is there with the permission of the Crown. The state- ments that it is not on railway lands and that subsection 3 of section 47 does not apply are merely mistaken admissions of legal consequences which were not asked for as conditions of the Board being allowed to assume jurisdiction and are, therefore, not binding upon the company.\nIf I had not reached the conclusion that the respondents\u2019 bridge is exempt under sub-section 3 of section 47, and that there is nothing to preclude their invoking that sub-section, I should be prepared to sustain the judgment of the Appellate Division on the ground that a bridge situated as is that in question, is not declared by the statute to be a subject of taxation with sufficient clearness and certainty to justify its being assessed.\nI would, for these reasons, dismiss this appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Gogo & Harkness.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Ewart, Scott, Maclaren & Kelly.\n[1] 34 Ont.

The plaintiffs\u2019 complaint was that the company had placed a regulator on its line at that place and by its use had prevented plaintiffs from delivering at the pressure agreed upon and they claimed the amount that would have been delivered but for the. interference according to the daily records on their own line. The contract is set out in full in the opinion of Mr. Justice Duff.\nThe case was heard by the Chancellor, who held that the company was liable and referred it to the Judge of the County Court to have the damages ascertained. The referee awarded plaintiffs all they claimed and his award was maintained by the Chancellor. The Appellate Division reversed and dismissed the action.\nTilley K.C. and W.T. Henderson E.C. for the appellants.\nCollier E.C. for the respondents.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I concur in the judgment of Mr. Justice Duff.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The appellants by an agreement dated 14th October, 1911 (wherein they were called the contractors), agreed with the respondent as follows:\u2014\n1. The contractors agree to sell and deliver to the company at its meter house in the Town of Dunnville, in the County of Haldimand, against the line pressure, from time to time in the company\u2019s line at that point, having regard to the contracts aforesaid, all the natural gas of a quality and purity suitable for domestic consumption which is now being, or which may be hereafter obtained from the lands now leased or controlled by the contractors in the Township of Canboro, particulars of which are set forth in the schedule hereto attached marked \u201cA,\u201d or hereafter acquired or controlled by them in the said township, in such amounts as they shall have available for, delivery at the rate of twenty cents per thousand cubic feet up to April 1st, 1912, and after that date at the rate of sixteen cents per thousand cubic feet to May 1st, 1913, and thereafter at the rate of twenty cents per thousand cubic feet.\nThe respondent therein agreed as follows:\u2014\n2. The company agrees to purchase from the contractors the said gas in the last paragraph mentioned at the prices aforesaid.\nThe next clause partly exonerated appellants from the comprehensive terms of said agreement by permitting them to use some of said gas obtained from said field for specified purposes incidental to their business operations.\nBy clause 10 the agreement was to remain in force and effect so long and so long only as gas could be found in paying quantities in the territory then leased or otherwise acquired by the contractors in the said township and they are able to deliver it at a pressure sufficient to enable the company to transmit it as specified.\nI should have supposed that the contract was tolerably plain but for the difference of judicial opinion which must make one pause.\nThe respondent had directly or indirectly prior contracts whereby it was bound to take, in the same transmission line from each of two other contractors respectively, a supply of a specified annual quantity of gas to be delivered.\nThe transmission line at Dunnville, to be used by the contractors respectively operating, under said prior contracts, apparently was contemplated to be the same line as that to be used for delivery by the appellants in fulfilling their contract.\nThere is not in appellants\u2019 contract any restriction upon the quantity to be supplied per annum or otherwise as there was in each of the other prior contracts. There is the following provision in clause 9 of appellants\u2019 contract:\u2014\n9. The contractors shall not at any time or times turn in any gas into the company\u2019s main without giving reasonable notice to the company, nor turn off any gas which shall have been turned into the company\u2019s main without the consent of the company first having been obtained.\nThere is not in appellants\u2019 contract any obligation to maintain any specified degree of pressure or any express limit upon the pressure permissible for appellants\u2019 gas.\nThe gas therefrom was to be conducted for eight miles by a 4\u00bd inch pipe. To enable the construction of that pipe by appellants the respondent contributed a loan of $5,000 without interest until the 1st of April, 1912, when that was to be repaid. There is nothing in the contract making the supply dependent upon the consuming capacity of the respondent or its customers.\nThe transmission line was of eight inches in diameter and capacity; and from Winger to St. Catharines was some twenty-two miles in length.\nThe appellants had in April, 1912, fifteen wells and drilled two more afterwards. Exactly how many existed at the date of the contract does not accurately appear.\nIn the first of the prior contracts in question (which I shall hereinafter call the Waines\u2019 contract) there was imposed upon the contractors an obligation to deliver their gas through respondent\u2019s line as then laid to Dunnville at a pressure of fifty pounds to the square inch, provided that the respondent should not maintain a pressure of greater than fifty pounds in its own line at the said point. There was nothing in it preventing a delivery at a greater pressure if the company chose to assent thereto.\nThe appellants took, by the plain terms of the contract, the risk of being able to deliver against the line pressure from time to time in the company\u2019s line at Dunnville.\nThat if supplied at fifty pounds pressure by a pipe in the Waines\u2019 system of equal dimensions to the eight-inch line of respondent\u2019s would obviously supply all the respondent needed if kept up continuously. But I infer the Waines\u2019 delivery pipe being only five and five-eighths inches diameter could not thereby shut out by its resistance another supply pipe\u2019s product. Nor could the product delivered through that and the delivery through another pipe of same dimensions combined shut out the appellants\u2019 product entirely, How much it would have permitted I cannot say.\nThe problem so presented has not been scientifically dealt with in any such way as it should have been; and I do not venture to speculate. I merely desire to point out by this illustration what I think were the possibilities the appellants faced in their contract.\nInstead of letting, as I think the contract intended, the resistent forces in the line of the respondent created by the pressure resulting from the deliveries from both the Waines\u2019 and Aikens\u2019 supply pipes combined, however great that might be, to determine the matter, the respondent applied to the appellants\u2019 delivery pipe a regulator it had never contracted for being so applied.\nI do not think it had any such right, nor do I think such a thing was ever in the contemplation of the parties. Having departed from the plain terms of the contract and adopted a test not provided for in the contract, the onus rested upon it of demonstrating, much more clearly than has been shewn herein, that the result obtained by the use of the regulator must of necessity have been the same as, or at least no more detrimental to the appellants than, the application of the test which the contract plainly expresses.\nFor example, I am unable to explain why, the average pressure in the respondent\u2019s line, nearly always during the eight months at least, in question herein, was below, and most markedly below, the fifty pound pressure, which the respondent would have us believe the regulator continuously provided against, although for the most part the average pressure in appellants\u2019 pipe during the same period exceeded fifty pounds pressure.\nThe only answer counsel for respondent could suggest as to this was that the hourly pressure forming the basis for the tables produced and sworn to, might not produce an accurate result. He suggested the average is derived from the hours by day as well as by night, when the pressure might have materially varied by reason of the use of gas being much greater in the day than during the night.\nI agree there is a possibility of discrepancies arising out of that, but I cannot think that it entirely accounts for the remarkable result that the evidence shews. And it is to be remarked that this is the basis upon which, as it seems to me, the payments under the contract for the supply of gas seem to have rested.\nAgain, this is only by way of illustration, for it devolved upon the respondent to have demonstrated and made clear, when it departed from the terms of the contract, how such results were possible.\nIt is said that the words \u201chaving regard to the contracts aforesaid\u201d cover the whole thing, and mean that a regulator was to be applied.\nIf so, assuredly it was a very simple thing to have had it so expressed. It is neither so expressed in this contract nor in the Aikens\u2019 contract which was made two years later than the Waines\u2019 contract, and three to four months before the appellants\u2019 contract and subject to the obligations in the Waines\u2019 contract.\nI am driven to the conclusion that the device of a regulator was entirely an afterthought and never present to the mind of any one at the time of making the contract.\nIt is said appellants must have known of its existence, and yet never remonstrated, but that is not proven. And on the other side we have the distinct claim put forward on the 23rd of January, 1913, reiterating complaints that appellants\u2019 gas was not being taken according to contract, and stating in letter of that date to the respondent\u2019s manager amongst other things, as follows:\u2014\nContrary to the terms of our contract you have maintained a regulator for the purpose of creating an artificial pressure against which we cannot feed and against which we beg to protest.\nTo this we have no reply in the evidence. Throughout the evidence there is a most remarkable absence of reference to proof relative to the regulator except the fact of its existence. And the results seem to destroy the alleged fact as to its proper setting.\nThere is quite apparent, in this case, the fact that Mr. Aikens was a contractor in one of the prior con- tracts as well as in that in question, and thus perhaps not personally so damaged as to induce him to cry out as much as otherwise he might have done on the score of this device.\nBut the respondent took the very unjustifiable course of contracting for and obtaining another contract for further supply and packing the pipes with the product thereof.\nIt looks as if respondent desired to lay hands upon as much territory as possible against the day when gas might be running short, and was content, therefore, to run the risk of paying for more than it could consume.\nSo much as can be gathered by way of the conduct of the parties interpreting the contract, as was suggested by respondent as of some weight, I think it operates entirely against the respondent when all the circumstances are considered.\nI think the construction of the contract is that put upon it by the learned referee and maintained in appeal by the Chancellor.\nAnd as to the damage I see no reason for interfering with same so ascertained and so maintained.\nIf, however, the assessment of damages had of necessity to turn alone upon the assumption of fact that the appellants\u2019 field had been depleted by the rivals referred to in the case, I should hesitate much to accept that alone as sufficient basis for such substantial damages.\nThe evidence put forward by each party on this head falls singularly short of what I should have liked to hear in a case turning upon the solution of problems respecting which none of the witnesses seem to me to have had either the knowledge or experi- ence which if possessed might have rendered their evidence very helpful.\nFor example, how can the daily experience of a man boring in the wrong place help us?\nThey, however, tell us enough to suggest the possibility that the man who postpones the reaping of his crop on such a field, runs imminent risk of losing a great part of it.\nBut it is not alone, from the supposed rivals in the immediate vicinity reaping that crop, as it were, that the risk is run.\nWhat the appellants call their field is perhaps but a very narrow part of a much wider field which may be so developed beyond it to their detriment pending delay in operations.\nFortunately we are not driven to rely upon such speculations alone. There may be in the evidence enough to found an assessment of a substantial sum based upon reasonable possibilities alone, but it does not strike me it would, necessarily, reach so far as the sum assessed.\nThere is in the case coupled with that a much more substantial element in the loss from a large fraction of unproductive capital invested, lying waste, as it were, by reason of the breach of the contract. But again we have nothing to shew how much.\nAnd again, what is much more palpable is the fact that the respondent instead of taking from the appellants what they tendered, chose to discard their legitimate claims and take from the Waines\u2019 contractors what they were not entitled to insist upon, and from yet others who should never have been brought into competition with appellants, that from which appel- lants should have obtained most substantial returns. The extent to which this was done to appellants\u2019 detriment is entered into and well demonstrated in Mr. Tilley\u2019s factum.\nThe result reached is one I cannot feel at liberty to interfere with and be assured I can do any better than the learned referee.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the referee and the Chancellor be restored with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014The first question concerns the construction of the agreement of October, 1911. The material passages are in the following words:-\u2014\nWhereas in a contract made between the United Gas Companies, Limited, and one Frederick M. Waines, on the 13th day of February, 1909, and amended on the 19th day of July, 1909, the said United Gas Companies, Limited, agreed to purchase from Waines gas as therein stated, to be delivered through the company\u2019s line as now laid to Dunnville, at a pressure of fifty pounds to the square inch, provided that a greater pressure is not maintained in the company\u2019s line between Dunnville and Winger;\nAnd whereas the company agreed, with the United Gas Companies, Limited, to transmit the gas so purchased from Waines through its said line for delivery into the lines of the United Gas Companies, Limited, in the Township of Wainfleet;\nAnd whereas by a contract made between William J. Aikens, \u2018Frank R. Lalor and S. A. Beck, of the one part, and the company of the other part, bearing date the 28th day of June, 1911, the company agreed to purchase gas from the said Aikens, Lalor and Beck as therein stated;\nAnd whereas the company desires to recognize the obligations of the United Gas Companies, Limited, binding upon it under said Waines\u2019 contract in so far as the transmission of the Waines\u2019 gas through its lines is concerned; and also to recognize its obligations to the said Aikens, Lalor and Beck to purchase and transmit gas pursuant to the said contract with them;\nAnd whereas the contractors are the owners of a gas field in the Township of Canboro, in the County of Haldimand, and have agreed to sell the gas developed in the said field, and hereafter to be developed therein, to the company, upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth; Now, therefore, this agreement witnesseth as follows:\u2014\n1. The contractors agree to sell and deliver to the company at its meter house in the Town of Durinville, in the County of Haldimand, against the line pressure from time to time in the company\u2019s line at that point, having regard to the contracts aforesaid, all the natural gas of a quality and purity suitable for domestic consumption which is now being, or which may be hereafter obtained from the lands now leased or controlled by the contractors in the Township of Canboro, particulars of which are set forth in the schedule hereto attached and marked \u201cA,\u201d or hereafter acquired or controlled by them in the said township, in such amounts as they shall have available for delivery at the rate of twenty cents per thousand cubic feet up to April 1st, 1912, and after that at the rate of sixteen cents per thousand cubic feet to May 1st, 1913, and thereafter at the rate of twenty cents per thousand cubic feet;\n2. The company agrees to purchase from the contractors. the said gas as in the last paragraph mentioned at the prices aforesaid.\n* * * * *\n12. The contractors agree to and with the company to lay a 4\u00bd-inch line from their wells, in the Township of Canboro aforesaid, to the company\u2019s meter house in Dunnville with the utmost possible expedition, so that the connection with the company\u2019s line can be made at the earliest possible moment and gas delivered by the contractors to the company under the terms of this agreement, the company advancing to the contractors the sum of five thousand dollars, towards the cost of construction of the said line, to be repaid by the contractors to the company without interest on or before the first day of April, 1912.\nThe rival constructions are: (1) By the appellants, that the respondent company agrees to take and pay for gas delivered by the appellants at the company\u2019s meter at Dunnville \u201cagainst the line pressure\u201d from time to time in the company\u2019s line at that point, such pressure not to exceed that occasioned by the execution of the contracts mentioned in the recitals.\n(2) On behalf of the respondent company that the respondent company is to take such gas so delivered when the pressure does not exceed 50 pounds per square inch in the respondent company\u2019s line.\nThe second of these constructions is that which was adopted in the Court of Appeal. As I read the judgment of Mr. Justice Hodgins the principal reason upon which this conclusion is based is derived from the fourth paragraph of the recitals. The view seems to be that by the two agreements mentioned in the recitals the respondent company or the United Gas Company assumed an obligation not to maintain a pressure in the respondent company\u2019s line greater than fifty pounds per square inch. With respect, I think, that is a misreading of the clause in the Waines\u2019 contract (clause 7), which is said to create this obligation:\u2014\nClause 7.\u2014This said natural gas shall be delivered through a meter or meters into the company\u2019s pipe or line it may procure to be built by any other company for the purpose of receiving and transmitting the gas herein agreed to be purchased, hereinafter called the \u201ctransmitting company\u201d at or near the west end of Canal Street in the Town of Dunnville, and is to be supplied and maintained at that point at a pressure of at least fifty pounds to the square inch, provided that the company shall not maintain a pressure of greater than fifty pounds in its own line at the said point.\nThere is a similar provision in the Lalor contract. I read the words beginning \u201cprovided that the company\u201d as declaring simply the condition upon the fulfilment of which the contractor\u2019s obligation to deliver on the terms prescribed depends. That, I think, is the meaning of the language itself. But, furthermore, I am unable to avoid reading the first paragraph of the recitals in the Lalor contract or the first paragraph of the recitals in the contract we have to construe as giving expression to the interpretation which the parties themselves had put upon the pre-existing contracts and that interpretation seems to me to accord with the view I have formed independently from an examination of the words themselves of these contracts. I agree that it must be taken that these recitals are intended as a declaration that the appellants and the respondent company were themselves contracting with reference to the fact that there were these contracts. It does not, however, seem to me that the declaration carries us beyond this point, that the respondent company\u2019s\u2019 line might be expected to be charged with gas to the degree that in the ordinary course would result from the fulfilment by the contractors under the earlier contracts of their obligations to deliver gas at fifty pounds pressure.\nWhat then is the effect of this declaration upon the interpretation of the words \u201chaving regard to the contracts aforesaid\u201d in the first paragraph of the operative part of the agreement before us? It cannot, I think, be held to qualify the words \u201cagainst the line pressure from time to time in the company\u2019s line at that point\u201d to the extent of the qualification imported by reading the words \u201cof fifty pounds to the square inch\u201d after \u201cpressure\u201d as the respondent company\u2019s argument requires. Nor do I think can they strictly be given the sense contended for by the appellants. It is more reasonable, I think, to explain their presence as arising from the desire to preclude any inference that the company was undertaking obligations incompatible with receiving and transmitting gas delivered to it under the provisions of the two recited contracts. That view is confirmed by the provisions of the preliminary agreement, the first paragraph of which provides that the vendors will deliver the gas at the company\u2019s meter house in Dunnville \u201cto be received by it against the pressure in its line at that point.\u201d The result is that the placing of the regulator, the effect of which was automatically to interrupt any access of gas from the appellants\u2019 pipe when the pressure in the respondent company\u2019s line exceeded fifty pounds to the square inch, was a wrongful act that prevented the appellants performing the condition entitling them to be paid in accordance with the terms of their contract.\nIt was argued by Mr. Tilley that there was delivery. I do not think it can strictly be said that there was delivery in fact because the gas alleged to have been \u201cdelivered\u201d did not pass out of the power and possession of the appellants. I think that strictly it is a case of wrongful prevention of delivery rather than a refusal to pay for gas in fact delivered.\nThe case is within the principle stated by Lord Blackburn in Mackay v. Dick[1] in these words:\u2014\nI think I may safely say, as a general rule, that where in a written contract, it appears that both parties have agreed that something shall be done, which cannot effectually be done unless both concur in doing it, the construction of the contract is that each agrees to do all that is necessary to be done on his part for the carrying out of that thing, though there may be no express words to that effect.\nWhat then is the basis on which damages are to be computed? In order to answer that question it is important, I think, to note precisely the nature of the contract into which the appellants had entered.\nTheir undertaking was in part to construct a pipe line 4\u00bc inches in diameter connecting their wells with the respondent\u2019s line at Dunnville. They were, in the words of the contract, to \u201cdeliver\u201d gas at Dunnville \u201cagainst the line pressure\u201d in the respondent\u2019s line. But that obviously means that, subject to their right to supply customers along the line of their pipe, they were to have their conduit so connected with their wells and their appliances arranged in such a way that the gas at Dunnville should be actuated by the full pressure available. The intent of the contract was that the contractors should do that. On the respondent company\u2019s part, it was to pay for such gas as should enter its line in these conditions, and as I have just said the company came under the implied obligation to do what might be necessary to enable the pressure in the appellant\u2019s line to have its natural and normal effect so that the compensation to which the appellants were entitled could be measured in the manner provided by the contract. Now it is perfectly clear that the appellants did everything which they were called upon to do under their contract, and, I think, this question of damages ought to be determined by the application of two well recognized principles.\nThe first principle is stated in a judgment of Mr. Justice Willes in a passage cited in and made the foundation of the decision of the Privy Council in Burchell v. Gowrie and Blockhouse Collieries[2], at page 626, which is in the following words:\u2014\nIn Inchbald v. Western Neilgherry Coffee, etc., Co.[3], Willes J. thus lays down the rule of law applicable to such cases: \u201cI apprehend that wherever money is to be paid by one man to another upon a given event, the party upon whom is cast the obligation to pay, is liable to the party who is to receive the money if he does any act which prevents or makes it less probable that he should receive it.\nTheir Lordships in that case held that, as the appellant had in substance done everything he was called upon to do to earn his commission (although his right of action was strictly a right of action for damages for wrongful prevention of performance rather than an action for recovery of commission, as such) he was entitled in the circumstances to recover in the form of damages the sum which would have been payable to him as commission had it not been for the wrongful conduct of the respondents. It may be observed in passing that in the case to which reference has already been made\u2014Mackay v. Dick[4]\u2014Lord Watson at page 270 points out that by the law of Scotland where a debtor bound under a certain condition impedes or prevents the event, the condition is held to be accomplished if the creditor has done everything incumbent upon him. This principle, Lord Watson says, has always been recognized by the law of Scotland, which derived it from the civil law. I do not desire to express any opinion on the question whether that principle is strictly applicable here; although there would appear to be nothing inconsistent with legal principle or with justice in holding that the respondent company (being bound by an obligation not to bar the ingress of the appellants\u2019 gas into their pipe) is precluded from taking advantage of its own wrong by denying that in fact the appellants\u2019 gas did enter its pipe, as it would have done if the course of events contemplated by the contract had been allowed to proceed without interruption by its officers. I do not find it necessary to put my judgment upon that ground because I think the decision in Burchell v. Gowrie and Blockhouse Collieries[5] is a sufficient authority for holding that the appellants, having done everything incumbent upon them under the contract and their efforts having failed to produce the contemplated effect only because of the wrongful conduct of the respondent company, they are entitled prim\u00e2 facie to the compensation that would have been payable to them had the respondent company not interposed and had the provisions of the contract with respect to compensation become fully operative. Reference may also be had to the judgment of Lord Alverstone C.J. in Odgens v. Nelson[6], at pp. 296 and 297.\nThe second principle is this: as against a wrongdoer, and especially where the wrong is of such a character that in itself it is calculated to make and does make the exact ascertainment of damages impossible or extremely difficult and embarrassing, all reasonable presumptions are to be made. The principle in the form in which it is applicable to this case is stated in these words taken from the judgment of Lord Selborne in delivering judgment for himself and the Lords Justices in Wilson v. Northampton and Banbury Junction Railway Co.[7]:\u2014\nWe know it to be an established maxim that in assessing damages every reasonable presumption may be made as to the benefit which the other parties might have obtained by the bon\u00e2 fide performance of the agreement. On the same principle, no doubt, in the celebrated case of the diamond which had disappeared from its setting and was not forthcoming, a great judge directed the jury to presume that the cavity had contained the most valuable stone which could possibly have been put there. I do not say that that analogy is to be followed here to the letter; the principle is to be reasonably applied according to the circumstances of each case.\u201d\nA number of authorities to the same general effect are referred to in Lamb v. Kincaid[8]. This prin- ciple is, I think, properly applied in holding as I do hold, first that the average daily readings are sufficient prim\u00e2 facie evidence for determining the pressure ratios, and secondly, that the onus was upon the respondent company to produce satisfactory evidence of any circumstances upon which it desired to rely as reducing the amount of damages which the appellants are prim\u00e2 facie entitled to recover. It was for them to shew if they desired to rely upon it as effecting the measure of damages that the gas, which otherwise would have passed into their pipe line, is still in the possession and power of the appellants and still available for sale. That appears to me to be an entirely reasonable application of the principle omnia pr\u0153-sumuntur contra spoliatorem.\nI add a word with reference to the point of view from which this contract seems to have been regarded. It appears to have been treated as a contract for sale and delivery of property simply. In one aspect, it is that, unquestionably; that is to say, the contract unquestionably does contemplate the transfer of property for a money price. But the authorities touching the estimation of damages arising from breach of contract for the sale of goods are almost universally decisions given in contemplation of circumstances so widely different from the circumstances contemplated by this contract that I cannot think they are of much assistance, except in so far as they lay down the broad principle that as a general rule where a contract is; broken the injured party is entitled to receive such a sum of money, by way of damages as will, so far as possible, put him in the same position as if the contract had been performed, provided that damages are not recoverable in respect of loss following the breach of contract unless the loss was (1) the natural and direct consequence of the breach, or (2) within the contemplation of both parties at the time of making the contract as the probable result of the breach. That is the broad principle which is strictly applicable, and I think the conclusions above indicated are strictly within the principle.\nIt is quite evident, moreover, that on the reference it was not seriously disputed that but for the regulator the appellants would have delivered, and would have been entitled to be paid for, the amount of gas in respect of which they claim. That is clear enough from the last paragraph of the referee\u2019s report which is in the following words:\u2014\nIt is admitted that plaintiffs, in addition to what was taken by defendant, had for delivery the quantity of gas they allege during the months from April to December, and were it not for the regulator would have delivered, viz., 44,853,170 ft. at 16c. per thousand c. ft., or $7,176.50.\nThe plaintiffs, however, with the defendant\u2019s consent sold\u2014\n1,050,000 c. ft. at 16c\n$ 147.00\n250,000 c. ft. at 20c\n50.00\n$ 197.00\nThe amount to which I find the plaintiffs are entitled is\n$ 7,176.50\nLess\n197.00\n$ 6,979.50\nAnd there should be judgment for the plaintiffs for $6,979.50.\nThe evidence of Mr. Price, the respondent\u2019s manager, cited in Mr. Tilley\u2019s factum at p. 10, is quite sufficient to justify this paragraph.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the Chancellor restored with costs in both courts.\nANGLIN, J.\u2014After careful consideration of the several contracts in evidence in this case, I have reached the conclusion that the \u201cproviso\u201d in the Waines contract did not merely state a condition to which the obligation of delivery under that contract was subject, but also imposed on the purchasers an obligation (within the meaning of the clauses in the Kohler contract which make it subject to the purchasers\u2019 obligations under the Waines contract) to prevent the pressure in their transmission line exceeding fifty pounds, whenever and so long as Waines was prepared to deliver gas at a pressure of fifty pounds. The defendant company admits that, in order to ensure the fulfilment of that obligation towards Waines, it resorted to the use of a regulator designed automatically to exclude the plaintiffs\u2019 gas whenever the pressure in the defendants\u2019 transmission line should exceed fifty pounds, and to admit such gas freely when that pressure should be less than fifty pounds. While the use of a device operating in this way may not have been beyond the defendants\u2019 rights so long as Waines was delivering at a fifty-pound pressure, they used it at their peril if in fact\u2014whether by accident or by design, whether through a defect discoverable or remediable, or latent and impossible to overcome\u2014it should exclude the plaintiffs\u2019 gas when the pressure in the transmission pipe was less than fifty pounds or when the Waines pressure fell below fifty pounds. The plaintiffs were entitled at all times to deliver against the pressure in the defendants\u2019 transmission line subject to the defendants\u2019 obligation to Waines to prevent that pressure excluding his gas delivered at fifty pounds. The plaintiffs had not the right to deliver gas in quantities which would increase that pressure beyond fifty pounds at a time when delivery under the Waines contract at fifty pounds pressure would be thereby interfered with. That, I think, is the effect of the contract between the parties.\nThere would appear to have been some uncertainty at the trial as to the function which the regulator was intended to perform and as to its actual operation. I take the following extracts from the opinion delivered by the learned referee as printed in the appeal case:\u2014\nIt was contended by the defendant that while the contract did not in words provide for the placing of this regulator, still in order to keep faith with Waines and Lalor, Beck and Aikens under their contracts, the company was bound to prevent gas coming from the plaintiffs into their line at a greater pressure than 50 pounds to the square inch, and so placed the regulator fixed so that the gas could not come from plaintiffs\u2019 line at a pressure less (sic) than 50 pounds.\nLater on he says:\u2014\nAn examination of the records during the period from April 1st, 1912, until December 31st, 1912, shews that the average pressure in the plaintiff\u2019s line was in some months in excess of the average pressure in the defendant\u2019s line, and in some months greatly in excess; and this was so notwithstanding the fact that the plaintiffs were compelled to shut off a number of their gas wells in the field.\nThis would indicate that it was the regulator (and if these records are correct the regulator must have been fixed at more than 50 pounds) placed by the defendant in their line, and not the pressure from the gas supplied under the two other contracts that prevented the plaintiffs from delivering all their available gas into the defendant\u2019s pipe line, and was, I think, a breach of their contract, for which the defendant is responsible in damages, if any can be shewn.\nThe impression of the learned referee would seem to have been that the operation of the regulator was meant to depend, and did in fact depend, not upon the pressure in the defendants\u2019 transmission line, but upon that in the plaintiffs\u2019 supply pipe. The case may have been so presented to him in argument and it may be, although the oral testimony is to the contrary, that the pressure returns warrant the conclusion that, as a matter of fact, the opening and closing of the regu- lator valve depended upon the pressure in the plaintiffs\u2019 supply pipe. If so, the use of the regulator was a clear breach of contract and the conclusion that it was \u201cfixed at more than fifty pounds\u201d would seem to be incontrovertible.\nIn view of the course of the argument in this court, there would seem to have been some misapprehension in this regard at the trial, and the conclusion there reached as to the extent of the defendants\u2019 liability is thus rendered less dependable than it otherwise would be. Counsel for both parties were in accord in this court upon the fact that the operation of the regulator was governed by the pressure in the defendants\u2019 transmission line, and the argument in the appellants\u2019 factum proceeds on that assumption.\nAlthough by no means as satisfactory as it might have been made, the evidence afforded by the returns of average daily pressures put in seems to me to establish that, from some cause not made clear, the effect of the operation of the regulator placed by the defendants on the supply pipe carrying the plaintiffs\u2019 gas was to exclude that gas from entering the defendants\u2019 transmission line when the pressure in it was less than fifty pounds during at least a very considerable part of the period between the 1st of April, 1912, and the 31st December, 1912. Moreover, it would seem that during a great part of that period the Waines\u2019 pressure was below fifty pounds. But this evidence does not enable us to say for how many hours on any day the wrongful exclusion of the plaintiffs\u2019 gas continued, or to determine how much of that gas available for delivery and not taken might have been delivered during that period without raising the pres- sure in the transmission line above fifty pounds, when the right to have it enter would cease, if, and so long as, Waines should be delivering at a pressure of fifty pounds. But the defendants having seen fit to place a regulating device upon the plaintiffs\u2019 supply line, and having had that device under their exclusive control, I think the burden was upon them to shew that it did not operate prejudicially to the plaintiffs\u2019 rights under their contract, or, if that could not be established, to shew the times and periods during which, and the extent to which it did not so operate. That they have failed to do, and they are, therefore, chargeable, in my opinion, with the consequences, whatever they may be, of having excluded the plaintiffs\u2019 gas during the whole period in question. Moreover, from the 19th December to the 31st December, it seems to be very clearly proved that the defendants took from contractors who had not priority over the plaintiffs 6,762,127 c. ft. of gas, much of which the plaintiffs might otherwise have delivered. They also appear to have taken under a contract with one Kindy (made subsequently to the contract with the plaintiffs) between August and December, 5,975,888 c. ft. of gas, the greater part of which the plaintiffs were entitled to supply.\nBut it is claimed on behalf of the defendants that the gas not taken by them has not been lost to the plaintiffs\u2014that they still have it and have merely been delayed in marketing it. For the plaintiffs it is urged, on the other hand, that there were gas wells in operation in the same field as theirs belonging to other persons, and that the gas which the defendants excluded by the regulating device placed on their supply pipe has passed away through such other wells and has been wholly lost to them. This was the conclusion reached by the learned referee; whereas the Appellate Division deemed the evidence insufficient to support it. With respect I am of the opinion that, subject to what I am about to say, there was evidence in the record sufficient to support this conclusion of the referee.\nBut it is at the same time my view that it is not established that the loss of this gas is wholly attributable to wrongful conduct on the part of the defendants. Their manager, no doubt, said, in the course of his testimony, that if the regulator had not been placed upon their pipe the plaintiffs would have delivered during the period in question the quantity of gas for which they claim. But he did not admit that such gas was excluded from the transmission line in breach of contract. It may be that as against the plaintiffs the defendants were bound to prove that the exclusion was rightful and that in the absence of evidence it should be assumed that conditions never existed which would have entitled them to exclude the plaintiffs\u2019 gas under the clause in the Waines\u2019 contract. Yet we cannot shut our eyes to the fact that during the summer months the consumption of gas for heating and domestic purposes is much smaller than in the winter, and that, had there been no regulator set against them, it is more than probable that all the gas which the plaintiffs had available for delivery during the summer season could not have entered the defendants\u2019 pipe unless the latter had allowed gas to go to waste. As Mr. Justice Hodgins points out, the defendants did not undertake to find customers for all the gas the plaintiffs should have available for delivery. The plaintiffs\u2019 right of delivery was limited to delivery against the pressure in the defendants\u2019 transmission line. It was, therefore, from its very nature subject to whatever restriction the limitations of the defendants\u2019 business should entail. Under these circumstances had there been no regulator used it seems tolerably clear that during the summer months a considerable quantity of the plaintiffs\u2019 gas available for delivery could not have been taken, and for gas held back on that account the defendants cannot be held responsible.\nWe have no records of the quantity of gas from all sources used by the defendants during these summer months. But we find that during April the plaintiffs delivered 8,609,495 c. ft.; from May to September the average monthly delivery was 4,672,076 c. ft.; in October it rose again to 7,522,787 c. ft. These figures indicate a lessening in the deliveries during the summer months, for which it is not unreasonable to assume that diminished consumption by the defendants\u2019 customers at least partly accounts. Moreover, as the other wells operating in the field were probably subject to similar conditions, it may be that gas held back at this season was not lost to the plaintiffs.\nIt is also noteworthy that from the 2nd to the 12th August, omitting the 3rd, for which the return is blank, the plaintiffs\u2019 average pressure was only 17.8 lbs. It was one pound on the 11th and 1.5 lbs. on the 10th.\nThe plaintiffs\u2019 claim is for 44,853,170 c. ft. Of this 31,863,414 c. ft. represents gas not taken during May, June, July, August and September. It is probably quite impossible to determine with even ap- proximate accuracy how much of that gas the plaintiffs would have been able to deliver against line pressure in the defendants\u2019 pipe. But dealing with the matter as a jury probably would, I should say that at least one-half of it could not have been taken. I would, therefore, deduct from the amount of the damages assessed at the trial $2,560.57 (the value of 15,931,707 c. ft., at 16 cents per M.), leaving a balance of $4,418.93, for which the plaintiffs should have judgment.\nIn the Appellate Division attention is drawn to the fact that the defendants paid the same price for the Waines\u2019 gas as for the plaintiffs\u2019 gas, viz., 16 cents per M. But another fact is apparently overlooked, namely, that under the Aikens-Lalor-Beck contract, the price was only 13 cents per M., and the holding back of the plaintiffs\u2019 gas may have enabled the defendants to obtain under that contract at a cheaper rate gas which the plaintiffs would otherwise have delivered.\nThe monthly settlements of accounts between the plaintiffs and defendants made as provided for by the contract were set up in answer to the plaintiffs\u2019 claim. But there is nothing to shew that when these settlements were made the plaintiffs knew that their gas was being wrongfully excluded from the defendants\u2019 transmission line.\nNo doubt loss of profit is ordinarily the measure of damages on breach of a contract of sale and purchase of a commodity. But in the present case there is nothing to suggest that delivery of the gas wrongly excluded by the defendants would have entailed any additional expense or outlay to the plaintiffs. They lost in its entirety the price to which they would have been entitled had that gas been taken by the defendants.\nI am unable, on the other hand, to construe the contract as entitling the plaintiffs to be paid, not as damages for breach of contract, but as purchase money, for all gas available for delivery whether taken or not.\nThe appellants are entitled to their costs of the appeal to this court, and of the proceedings in the High Court Division.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Idington.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Wilkes & Henderson.\nSolicitor for the respondents: H.H.

Fothergill (L.R. 7 H.L. 158), Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies J. dissenting, that if the lessor, without fault, was unable to give title in fee to the land the lessee was not entitled to damages for loss of his bargain.\nPer Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies J.\u2014The above rule should not be applied in a case like this where the lease contained onerous conditions binding the lessee to expend large sums in improving the property and it must have been contemplated by the parties that such expenditure would have caused him special damage if he could not purchase the fee.\nJudgment appealed against (32 Ont. L.R. 243) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], varying the judgment at the trial[2] in favour of the plaintiffs.\nOn the 2nd day of February, 1903, the respondent leased to the appellants a certain parcel of land in the Township of Sandwich East, and extending from the front River Road to the water\u2019s edge and from there to the channel bank of the Detroit River, for a term of ten years at a rental of $1,000 a year. The lease contained a provision giving the appellants the right to purchase the premises at the end of the term of ten years for $22,000, provided the company gave six months previous notice in writing of its intention to do so.\nThe appellant company was incorporated for the purpose of manufacturing asphalt blocks, and upon entering the premises under the lease they erected a large expensive manufacturing plant and built expensive docks, partly on the land and partly on the water lot, the whole of the expenditure amounting to about $200,000, and from year to year the company spent some $8,000 to $12,000 a year for betterments and improvements, including the necessary repairs.\nThe company gave the required six months notice in pursuance of the terms of the lease, and on the 2nd day of February, 1913, at the end of the said term granted by the lease, tendered to the respondent the sum of $22,000 demanding a conveyance of the lands and premises. But the respondent refused to accept said sum and refused to make the conveyance as provided under the terms of the lease.\nThe company commenced an action on the 10th day of February, 1913, claiming specific performance of the covenant contained in the lease, and damages.\nThe action came on for trial before the Honourable Mr. Justice Lennox without a jury on the 27th day of May, 1913, and it appeared at the trial from the evidence of the respondent, Montreuil, that he had made the lease in question under the assumption that he was the owner in fee simple of the property set out in the lease, but that he discovered in 1908 that he only had a life estate in the property.\nThe respondent was advised by counsel at that time that the property went to his children after his death, but no evidence was offered of any effort being made by the respondent to get in a title to the property, nor was any evidence offered of any refusal by the respondent\u2019s children to join in a conveyance of the property to the appellant company under the terms of the lease. But there is evidence that they did join with him in the conveyance of other portions of the property.\nEvidence was given that the property had increased enormously in value since the making of the lease.\nThe learned trial judge reserved judgment, and subsequently on the 19th day of June, 1913, delivered judgment decreeing specific performance of the agreement for the interest of the defendant in all the demised lands and an abatement in the purchase money for the difference in value on the 2nd day of February, 1913, of an estate in fee simple and an estate for the life of the defendant in respect of so much of the land as the defendant was not able to convey in fee, and also in respect of the damages which the plaintiffs might suffer by reason of such breach of contract over and above the difference in value of an estate in fee simple and for the life of the defendant; and directed reference to the master of the court at Sandwich.\nThe respondent appealed to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario, which gave judgment on the 27th day of November, 1914, varying the judgment of the trial judge by directing that the abatement in the purchase money should be based upon the assumption that the value of the fee simple was, at the date of expiry of the term, the proportionate part of the purchase price agreed upon attributable to the land in which the lessor had only a life estate and by directing further that the plaintiff company should have no damages for any loss sustained by reason of the money expended upon the property or by reason of any other matter except the abatement aforesaid.\nFrom this judgment the appellants now appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nD.L. McCarthy K.C. and Rodd for the appellants. The appellants expended large sums in carrying out the object for which the purchase was intended and should recover back the same as damages even under the rule in Bain v. Fothergill[3].\nThe respondent was bound to do all in his power to enable him to give us a title and has done nothing. See Day v. Singleton[4]; Engell v. Fitch[5]; Lehmann v. McArthur[6]; Jones v. Gardiner[7].\nCowan K.C. for the respondent. The respondent was in good faith and is not liable to damages. Flureau v. Thornhill[8]; Bain v. Fothergill3.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting).\u2014The respondent granted to the appellant a lease dated 2nd February, 1903, of certain parcels of land in the Township of Sandwich East fronting on the Detroit River for the term of ten years at the rents and subject to the covenants and conditions therein mentioned. The lease contained the following (amongst other) provisions:\u2014\nIt is agreed between the parties hereto that the lessee, its successors and assigns shall have the right to purchase the demised premises at the end of the demised term of ten years for the cash sum of $22,000, provided it shall have given six months\u2019 previous notice in writing of its intention so to do.\nAnd the said lessor for himself, his heirs, administrators, executors and assigns, covenants that he will on the exercise by the lessee of said option to purchase and on payment of said sum of $22,000 execute and deliver to the lessee, its successors and assigns, a good and sufficient deed in fee simple free of incumbrances of the land hereinbefore described.\nIt is also agreed that in case said lessee fails to exercise said option to purchase by giving said notice it may on giving three months\u2019 notice in writing before the expiration of the demised term have a renewal of this lease for a further term of ten years on the same terms as to rent, payment of taxes and water rates.\nThe lessee for itself, its successors and assigns agrees to build a clock on the demised premises within one year from the date hereof at a cost of at least $6,000, which dock is to become the property of the lessor at the end of the demised term or after the renewal term in case of renewal as. aforesaid unless in the exercise of the option the lessee purchases the said lands.\nThe appellant constructed the dock stipulated for in the lease and during its currency expended many thousand dollars in buildings on and improvements to the property.\nThe appellant duly gave the requisite notice to purchase the demised premises. It then appeared that the respondent was not possessed of the fee simple of the premises and was consequently unable to carry out his agreement to sell. Such title as the respondent had was derived from the will of his father, Luc X. Montreuil.\nThe devise which covers the lands in question in this suit is in the following terms:\u2014\nI give and devise to my son Luc all that, etc., * * * to him said Luc during his natural life, then to his children, should he marry and have issue share and share alike their heirs and assigns forever.\nThe respondent had nine children.\nThe appellant claimed:\u2014\n1. Specific performance of the covenant to convey contained in the indenture of lease.\n2. Damages.\nThe judgment of the appeal court proceeds on the rule established by the jurisprudence of the English courts that the contract for sale of real property is an exception to the ordinary rules of law applicable to the question of the damages recoverable upon a breach of contract.\nThis rule, first laid down in the case of Flureau v. Thornhill[9], is that upon a contract for the purchase of real estate if the vendor, without fraud, is incapable of making a good title the intended purchaser is not entitled to any compensation for the loss of his bargain.\nFlureau v. Thornhill9 was much disputed and in several cases held open to exceptions. It was, however, discussed and approved in the case of Bain v. Fothergill[10] in the House of Lords when the judges were summoned to advise the House.\nThough it is claimed to have been introduced from the civil law it has been said that the exception to the general rule as to damages established by Flureau v. Thornhill9 is not founded upon any principle. In the case of Engell v. Fitch[11] Lord Chief Baron Kelly speaks of the rule as a\nqualification of the rule of common law, * * * founded entirely on the difficulty that a vendor often finds in making a title to real estate. not from any default on his part, but from his ignorance of the strict legal state of his title.\nWhere the condition for this reason for the rule does not exist, at any rate to the same extent, it would seem that the latter would have a more limited application. The state of the title to real estate in England is undoubtedly vastly more complicated than in this country. The defect in the title in the present case is so obvious that it does not require a lawyer to discover it; the property is left to the devisee\nduring his natural life, then to his children;\nif the respondent had looked to his title at all he could hardly have thought himself the absolute owner of the property to dispose of as he alone pleased.\nThere is another ground which distinguishes this case from Flureau v. Thornhill[12]. It was held that the case of Hopkins v. Grazebrook[13] provided an exception to the rule in the former case and one of the grounds on which the decision was based was that the defendant expressly undertook to make a good title. The respondent in this case expressly undertook to execute a conveyance in fee simple.\nThe rule in Flureau v. Thornhill12 finds little favour in the United States. In Sedgwick on Damages, 9th ed, vol. 3, at p. 2121, we read:\u2014\nIf the defendant fails to convey because he has not a good title, he is always liable in substantial damages. This is commonly called the United States Supreme Court Rule, and represents one extreme of the series of principles of which the highest English court has adopted the other extreme. It seems to be the correct one on principle.\nI have thought it well to make the foregoing remarks as perhaps affording support to the appeal, but the real ground on, which I rest my judgment is that in any event this case is outside the transactions to which in its widest interpretation the rule making exception to the general law of contracts has any application.\nThe rule deals solely with a simple contract for an immediate sale of real estate. According to the English practice this is directly followed by the delivery by the vendor to the purchaser of the abstract of title. If it then appears that the title is defective the expenses to which the purchaser has been put are ordinarily little more than for the investigation of the title and these he is entitled to recover; beyond this actual outlay he has lost nothing but the fancied goodness of his bargain and for this he is not entitled to damages.\nIt must be remembered that the practice of giving options does not obtain to any great extent in England and there is very little to be found in the books on the subject.\nNow in Bain v. Fothergill[14] Mr. Justice Denman speaking of the case of Engell v. Fitch[15], in which it was held that the rule in Flureau v. Thornhill[16] did not apply, said:\u2014\nThe case is of great value as shewing beyond all question that the rule in Flureau v. Thornhill[17] is a rule wholly confined to cases of inability to make a title, and not to breaches of contract in respect of the sale of real property from whatever cause arising.\nAnd criticising the judgment in Hopkins v. Grazebrook[18], he says:\u2014\nWhen carefully examined, I think that all the observations of the learned judges in that case, read with reference to the facts of the case, amount to no more than a decision that mere inability to make a good title does not, of itself, bring a vendor within the rule laid down in Flureau v. Thornhill17 as to damages; but that it depends upon the nature of the contract, and also upon the reasons for the inability, whether he can avail himself of that rule: and that in such a case as that of Hopkins v. Grazebrook18 a vendor was not within the rule. * * * In my opinion the judgments are to be read as only containing some of the reasons for holding that whether Flureau v. Thornhill17 was correctly decided or not, it certainly was no authority for the proposition that under all circumstances and whatever the cause of the default, a vendor unable to make a good title should have a right to break his contract, subject to a certain limited amount of damages.\nIn Mayne on Damages (8 ed.), P. 245, we read:\u2014\nIt has also been held that the rule in Flureau v. Thornhill17 does not apply in cases where the agreement shews upon its face that the vendor has not as yet got and, therefore, possibly may never get the title which he undertakes to convey; yet he expressly undertakes at once, or on a given date, to put the purchaser in possession; and the purchaser, in consideration of such agreement, undertakes to do. and does, something which cannot be undone, and which is of permanent benefit to the vendor; for the very nature of the undertaking on both sides, shews that it is not dependent on the contingency of a good title being made out. In such a case damages for breach of agreement will not be merely nominal. The purchaser will be entitled, under the general rule of common law, to such a pecuniary amount as is the difference between the present state of things, and what it would have been if the contract had been duly carried out.\nA case in support of this is Wall v. City of London Real Property Co.[19]\nNow what is the contract in this case? The respondent leases to the appellant for ten years at $1,000 a year with onerous covenants by the lessee; it is agreed that the lessee shall at the expiration of the term have the option to purchase for $22,000, the lessor covenanting to execute a good and sufficient deed in fee simple; in case the lessee fails to exercise the option to purchase it may have a renewal of the lease for a further ten years; the lessee agrees to build a dock at a cost of at least $6,000 to become the property of the lessor unless the lessee purchases.\nThe lessee has not only fulfilled all the agreements in the lease and done everything requisite to obtain a conveyance in fee simple, but has expended further large sums in improvement of the property, of course, in anticipation of becoming the owner at the expiration of the lease.\nIs it not obvious that the damages sustained by the appellant by reason of the failure of the respondent to implement his agreement are altogether special and by no means such loss of a bargain as alone is contemplated by the rule in Flureau v. Thornhill[20]?\nI think it is impossible to hold that such an agreement is to be governed by an admittedly anomalous rule of law in England, one based on reasons which may have little application here; presupposing entirety different conditions and intended to have application not to any damage sustained by the purchaser, but solely to the possible loss of his prospective profit on a resale of the property.\nIt cannot, I think, be necessary to treat this very special rule as absolutely inflexible regardless of all attendant conditions. I am not quite able to follow the learned judge of the Appellate Division in what he says as to the anomaly of a purchaser who has elected to take what the vendor can convey recovering damages as well. He states that he has not found any cases in which such damages have been awarded. Inasmuch as the rule provides that no damages can be recovered even if partial performance of the contract is not decreed, this would appear to be only natural since the decision of Flureau v. Thornhil20. I think before this time cases might be found. In Cleaton v. Gower[21], the defendant agreed to lease to the plaintiff for ten years with the right to take out coal and other minerals, and in his defence pleaded that he was only tenant for life and, therefore, he could not execute the agreement because\n\u2019tis inconsistent with his power so to do.\nThe court decreed that Gower should execute his agreement in specie as far as he was capable of doing it, and likewise shall satisfy the plaintiff, such damages as he hath sustained in not enjoying the premises according to the agreement, and seal a lease for ten years, etc.\nThere is no objection to the court in a proper case decreeing specific performance and also awarding damages. In the head-note in Phelps v. Prothero[22], we read:\u2014\nIn a case decided before 21 & 22 Vict., ch. 27, came into operation, held that the court has jurisdiction to award damages for the want of a literal performance of a contract of which it directs the specific performance and will in general do so.\nOf course the \u201cChancery Amendment Act,\u201d 21 & 22 Vict., ch. 27 (\u201cLord Cairns\u2019 Act\u201d) gave express power to the court to award damages either in addition to or in substitution for specific performance.\nThen as to the remarks of Chief Justice Meredith concerning the appellants\u2019 means of knowledge of the respondent\u2019s title. The latter being only tenant for life could, of course, make no demise to endure be- yond his own life and, therefore, was in no position to make the lease for ten years, still less to covenant for its renewal for a further term of ten years. The lessee could not call for or dispute the lessor\u2019s title and until the option to purchase was exercised there was no contract for sale which would have entitled the appellant to call for the title.\nThe Chief Justice says that the appellant had the same opportunity of knowing what the nature of the respondent\u2019s title was as the respondent himself had. I think this must be going too far in any case; the respondent must surely as devisee under the will of his father be credited with better knowledge than the appellant. But in any case such knowledge would have been accidental in this particular case and cannot, I think, affect the principle involved.\nThat it would have been the more prudent course for the appellant when making the contract to have insisted on immediate preliminary proof of the respondent\u2019s title may be admitted and perhaps the company may have to suffer loss in any event as a consequence of not doing so, but that is no reason for relieving the respondent from liability for failure to fulfil his contractual obligations. Chief Justice Meredith says that it may seem a hardship that the rights of the appellants should be limited to the relief to which his judgment holds them entitled. I think myself the appellant would suffer a great wrong in such case and am glad to think that there is no absolute rule of law which deprives them of their remedy.\nAs regards the damages to which the appellant is entitled I do not know that I can do better than refer to the case above cited of Wall v. City of Lon- don Real Property Co.[23] The questions in that case were:\u2014\n1st. Whether the plaintiff is entitled to nominal damages only?\n2nd. On what principle the damages are to be assessed?\nAnd the Court:\u2014\nWe answer the first question by saying that the plaintiff is not confined to nominal damages only. To the second we answer that the arbitrator must apply the general rule of common law, and ascertain as well as he can what the pecuniary amount is of the difference between the present state of things and what it would have been if the contract had been performed and the plaintiff had got a title.\nThe only difference in the present case is that the Master must ascertain as well as he can what is the pecuniary amount of the difference between the state of things as it will be under the limited estate which the appellant takes in accordance with the judgment and what it would have been if the contract had been performed.\nI would allow the appeal with costs.\nDAVIES J. (dissenting).\u2014The question in this case to be determined is whether the facts bring it within the rule of law laid down in Bain v. Fothergill[24], that if a vendor of land without fraud is incapable of making a good title the intending purchaser is not entitled to recover compensation in damages for the loss of his bargain.\nThat rule has for many years been adopted as part of their jurisprudence by the Ontario courts and it is not my desire or intention to call that adoption in question.\nThe question arising in this appeal is not whether that rule is in force in Ontario, but whether the facts of this ease bring it within the rule.\nI understand a majority of the court holds that the rule applies and I desire to state very shortly my reasons for dissenting.\nIn the case of Day v. Singleton[25] the Court of Appeal held that:\u2014\nA purchaser of leasehold property which the vendor cannot assign without a licence from his lessor, is entitled to damages (beyond return of the deposit, with interest and expenses) for loss of his bargain by reason of the vendor\u2019s omission to do his best to procure such licence.\nIn delivering the judgment of the court, Lord Lindley M.R. said, p. 328:\u2014\nSingleton never asked the lessors to accept Day as their tenant without a bar and consequently it would be for him, Singleton, to shew that if he had asked them they would have refused.\nNow, in the present case, it is contended that when the respondent Montreuil ascertained that he could not give the Ontario Asphalt Company a good title and that he had only a life estate, the remainder being in his children, it became his duty as between him and the Asphalt Company with whom he had covenanted to give a good title to do all that lay in his power to enable him to carry out his contract and to shew that he had applied to his children to join with him in conveying to the Asphalt. Company and that they had refused to do so.\nThere was evidence that they did join with him upon request in the conveyance of other portions of the same property, but no evidence that he had applied to them to do so with respect to the property in dispute. I confess I was much struck with this argument. If it was Montreuil\u2019s duty \u201cto do all that lay in his power\u201d to give appellants a good title, then it seems reasonable to say that it would be part of his duty to the Asphalt Company under the peculiar facts of this case to try and obtain the signature of his children to the deed and so complete his contracts with them. Lehmann v. McArthur[26], at pp. 500 and 503; Williams v. Glenton[27], at pp. 208-9, and Godwin v. Francis[28], at p. 306.\nI do not desire, however, to rest my judgment upon that ground, but rather upon the ground that the special facts of this case and the special terms of the lease to the company with the option of purchase at the end of the term of ten years, provided six months\u2019 notice of the lessee\u2019s intention to purchase was given, together with the covenant on the lessor, Montreuil\u2019s part to convey a good title in fee simple, and a covenant from the lessee to build a dock on the demised premises within a year from the granting of the lease at a cost of at least $6,000, which dock was to become the property of the lessor at the end of the demised term, unless the lessee purchased under his option, all combine to convince me that this is not a case in which the rule in Bain v. Fothergill[29] should be applied, but rather one in which on the neglect, refusal or inability of the lessor to comply with his covenant to give a good title free from incumbrance substantial damages should be awarded.\nThe evidence shewed that the company had after entering upon the lands under the lease erected an expensive manufacturing plant and docks partly on the leased upland and partly on the water lot in front of it as to which latter lot Montreuil had obtained a grant from the Crown, the whole expenditure aggregating $200,000, besides yearly betterments and improvements, A part of this expenditure at least was made in pursuance of respondent\u2019s covenant in the lease to expend at least $6,000 in dock construction.\nThe Appellate Division, reversing the trial judge, who had decreed specific performance and an abatement in the price amounting to substantial damages the latter to be determined on a reference, directed that the abatement in the purchase money should be based upon the value of the interest in the lands which the defendant could convey, having regard to the \u201cpurchase price\u201d of the whole and refusing other damages beyond the abatement.\nI cannot accede to the principle on which the Appellate Court has directed the abatement, basing it upon the stipulated purchase price and limiting it to that while ignoring the expenditure which as part of the consideration for the granting of the lease the lessees covenanted to make in building a dock on the lands.\nThis expenditure, the minimum amount of which was placed at $6,000 and the maximum of which might reach $60,000 or more, was really and substantially as much a part of the purchase price as the $22,000 mentioned and has just as much right to be considered in determining what abatement should be made as the latter sum.\nBut over and beyond that I do not think the case is one within the principle of Bain v. Fothergill[30], nor that substantial damages should be denied the vendee. That principle is as Lindley M.R. says in Day v. Singleton[31],\nan anomalous rule based upon and justified by difficulties in shewing a good title to real property in this country, but one which ought not to be extended in cases to which the reasons on which it is based do not apply.\nNow, I take it that one of the reasons on which the rule is based is that it is not within the contemplation of both parties in the ordinary case of a contract for sale of land, that if the vendor is incapable of making a good title the intending purchaser is to receive compensation for the loss of his bargain beyond the expenses he has incurred.\nBut if there are special facts in the case shewing that it was and must have been in contemplation of both parties that failure on the part of the vendor to carry out his covenant to\nexecute and deliver to the purchaser a good and sufficient deed in fee simple of the land\nmust inevitably cause the intending purchaser great damage, as was the case here; and if, in addition, the purchaser has bound himself on the faith of this covenant to expend very large sums of money on dock and other improvements as the purchaser did here, then I say in the event of the vendor failing to give the good title he covenanted to give, the common law rule as to damages for breach of contract applies and the \u201canomalous rule\u201d laid down in Bain v. Fothergill30, relating to ordinary contracts between vendor and vendee with respect to the sale of lands does not apply. I do not contend that any damages can be recovered in respect of anything that the purchaser did or incurred after he discovered the defect in the title; I limit my observations to those incurred by him before such discovery.\nFor these reasons, I would allow the appeal.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014I think the judgment appealed from is right for the reasons assigned in support thereof by the learned Chief Justice for Ontario.\nThe case seems a hard one, but that is no reason for our adopting bad law and disturbing the minds of those who prefer that well settled law should be upheld.\nIn truth we are asked to assess damages besides giving such relief in way of specific performance as can be given.\nAssuming for argument\u2019s sake damages recoverable at all in such a case (which I do not admit) the basis therefor must be proved as in any other claim for damages. It is not enough to rouse mere suspicion.\nThe respondent was a witness and counsel for appellant refrained from asking him a single question, much less anything tending to shew he had acted in bad faith or failed in any regard to do what his contract bound him to do. It can only be in such a case as shews a failure of duty on a defendant\u2019s part that damages would be assessable even if all questions relative to specific performance were out of the case. The circumstances relied on do not supply such proof as required.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014I concur in the judgment of the court dismissing the appeal. ANGLIN J.\u2014Admitting the applicability of the rule laid down in Bain v. Fothergill[32], to the original option in this case, the appellants have sought to bring it within the qualification upon that rule recognized in Day v. Singleton[33]. But in the latter case the Court of Appeal, as the judgment of Lord Lindley shews (p. 328), took the view that the correspondence between. Singleton\u2019s solicitors and the lessor established that if Singleton (the vendor of the leasehold) did not actually procure the refusal of the lessors\u2019 assent to the assignment to Day, he\ncertainly made no effort to obtain it * * * as it was his duty to do * * * and it ought to be inferred as against Singleton that the lessors would have accepted Day if Singleton had asked them to do so.\nThe decision there proceeded upon the fact, held to have been sufficiently proven, that it was within the vendor\u2019s power to carry out his contract and that he refused or neglected to take the means available. Here the plaintiffs rely upon the fact that the defendant maintained silence after his inability to make title had become known and they had asked him to obtain confirmation of the option from the remaindermen, the fact that the remaindermen had (under what circumstances, or for what consideration does not appear) confirmed the title of some other grantees of the defendant who were in like plight with the plaintiffs, and the further fact that, in answer to the plaintiff\u2019s suit for specific performance, other defences were set up in addition to that of inability to make title. I am quite unable to find in these bald facts\u2014and the plaintiffs have nothing else\u2014enough to warrant an inference that the defendant after discovery of the defect in his title made no effort to procure the concurrence of the remaindermen; still less do I find enough to warrant the inference that such an effort, if made, would have been successful.\nThe appeal, in my opinion, fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should toe dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Rodd, Wigle & McHugh.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Kenning & Cleary.\n[1] 32 Ont.

A mining company incorporated under the \"Companies Ordinance,\" ch. 61, N. W. Terr. Con. Ord., 1905, and certified, according to section 16 of the ordinance, to have limited liability under the provisions of section 63 thereof, has, in virtue of the authority given to such companies by section 63a \"to dig for * * * minerals * * * whether belonging to the company or not,\" power to drill wells for mineral oils on its own property and also to carry on similar work as a contractor on lands belonging to other persons. Idington and Duff JJ. dissented.\nPer curiam.\u2014Rock oil is a \"mineral\" within the meaning of section 63 of the \"Companies Ordinance.\"\nPer Duff J.\u2014Drilling for oil is not a mining operation within the contemplation of sections 63 and 63a of the \"Companies Ordinance.\"\nJudgment appealed from (8 West. W.R. 996) affirmed, Idington and Duff JJ. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], affirming the judgment of Hyndman J., at the trial, by which the plaintiffs' action was maintained with costs. The issues raised on the appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nGeo. E. Ross K.C. for the appellants.\nA. H. Clarke K.C. for the respondents.\nTHE- CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I am of opinion that the judgment in this case which was unanimously approved by the judges of the Alberta appeal court is right. I agree with Chief Justice Harvey that\nthere is ample evidence for thinking that the seizure was not honestly made.\nThe only question calling for remark is the defence that the contract was ultra vires of the respondents. The powers given to companies by section 63a of the \"Companies Ordinance\" include power\n(2) to dig for * * * minerals * * * whether belonging to the company or not.\nThe words \"to dig for\" may not in the popular sense appear very apt to describe the process of boring an oil well of some thousands of feet deep, hut the words as used must clearly receive a wide and special interpretation as they would be understood by those concerned with mining. Obviously you cannot obtain the mineral oil by digging with a spade, as the literal meaning might perhaps suggest, but the same is also true as regards all other minerals for mining which modern machinery is employed. It could hardly be suggested that under this power the company is not entitled to bore for oil on its own property. The words, I think, cover any process by which the earth is broken into for the extraction of the minerals. Chief Justice Harvey says that\none of the objects of the company is to bore for oil as a contractor. He concludes assuming that if the company is not one which comes within section 63 it is incorporated under section 16 and if the certificate of incorporation states that it is within section 63 it is in error to that extent, but no farther.\nThe object as stated 'by the Chief Justice does not appear in so many words in the memorandum of association which, however, does contain the same power as the above quoted paragraph (2) of section 63a of the Act.\nI am of opinion that the company is limited under section 63, but has power under section 63a to enter into the contract.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014The respondent company entered into a contract with the appellant to drill two wells on the latter's holdings at such places as it might select to a total depth of 2,500 feet each or, upon its request, to drill 500 feet further; to furnish engine, boiler and fuel, camp, provisions, lumber, labour and all tools and supplies necessary to do the work subject to provisions thereinafter contained; upon the completion of each well to clean out and properly cap same; to extinguish any fire resulting through negligence of the respondent or its servants or agents; to use the best materials and labour available; to proceed continuously in a workmanlike manner; to have in charge of the work during continuance thereof competent drillers; in certain events specified, rendering work abortive, at respondent's expense to set the equipment over to a place to be selected by appellant, and drill, free of cost to it, a hole of same size and depth; to insure against accident each and every one of the men employed in said work, in a sum sufficient to cover any damages, and indemnify appellant; to remove from the well all casing therein not required by appellant to be left there; to procure the strata drilled and keep a log of drilling; and not to open same to inspection by any person other than appellants, or give information as to the work to any one else.\nSuch is a fair general outline of what the respondent undertook and for which it was to get $8.50 per foot, and beyond the specified 2,500 feet $10 per foot.\nThere are a number of other things agreed to on each side providing for varying and various contingencies in the course of executing the contract or stopping its further prosecution. The parties disagreed, and the appellant took possession of the respondent's plant and dismissed the respondent from the further prosecution of the work. The respondent sued the appellant therefor. The latter set up, amongst other defences, that the contract so entered into was ultra vires the respondent company.\nThe courts below overruled this as well as other defences and entered judgment for respondent.\nI incline to think, in all other regards than that relative to the question of ultra vires, that the court of appeal was right, but the opinion I have formed relative to this question renders it unnecessary I should form or express any definite opinion as to the other defences.\nThe opinion of Chief Justice Harvey, concurred in by the other members of the court, contains the following:\u2014\nI am of opinion that it is not necessary to determine whether this company is one which comes within the terms of section 63 or not. for it is not by virtue of section 63 that it is incorporated. It is incorporated as any other company under the general provisions of the Ordinance. There is no doubt that its object comes within the legislative authority of the province and that, therefore, it may be duly incorporated under the Ordinance. If the certificate of incorporation which, as section 63 says, is issued under section 16 and not under section 63, states that the liability of the company is specially limited under that section when the company is in fact one that does not come within the terms of that section and whose liability, therefore, is not limited under that section, the certificate is in error to that extent, but not necessarily any farther. The company is incorporated because it has complied with the provisions of the Ordinance and obtained a certificate of incorporation and has the powers necessarily incident to a company with its object. One of the objects of the plaintiff is to bore for oil as a contractor.\nClearly, therefore, this contract is within its powers. Section 3 is for the express purpose of limiting the liability of the members. The question of liability does not arise here and it is, therefore, unnecessary to decide whether the company is within section 63 or not.\nThis extract contains, I think, a fair presentation of the point of view taken by the court of appeal in which I was at first inclined to agree as, possibly, the correct construction of a statute with which I was not familiar.\nI find, however, on an examination of the provisions of the Alberta ordinance, known as the \"Companies Ordinance,\" under which the respondent became incorporated, if it ever so became, that I cannot agree either in the view so expressed or the reasoning upon which it proceeds. I assume the section 3 referred to in the extract is a clerical error for section 63.\nThe \"Companies Ordinance\" provides, by section 5, as follows:\u2014\n5. Any three or more persons associated for any lawful purpose to which the authority of the legislature extends, except for the purpose of the construction or operation of railways or of telegraph lines or the business of insurance, except hail-insurance, may by subscribing their names to a memorandum of association and otherwise complying with the requirements of this Act in respect of registration form an incorporated company with or without limited liability. 1911-12, ch. 4, sec. 4.\nIf this company had become incorporated under that provision alone and in the memorandum of association had named one of its objects to 'be that of carrying on the business of a driller or of a contractor for drilling wells or any such apt terms as covering the business involved in the contract in question herein, there could be no question herein of its powers.\nIt abandoned any such ground when it chose to become incorporated not by that provision alone, but by virtue of entirely different provisions containing a limitation of that general power and expressly restricting the possible objects of the company within the ambit of what sections 63 and 63a provide.\nSection 63, in the first part, is as follows:\u2014\n63. The memorandum of association of a company incorporated or re-incorporated under this Ordinance, the objects whereof are restricted to acquiring, managing, developing, working and selling mines, mineral claims and mining properties and petroleum claims and lands and natural gas claims and lands and the winning, getting, treating, refining and marketing of mineral therefrom, may contain a provision that no liability beyond the amount actually paid upon shares and stocks in such company by the subscribers thereto or holders thereof shall attach to such subscriber or holder; and the certificate of incorporation issued under section 16 of this Ordinance shall state that the company is specially limited under this section. 1901, ch. 20, sec. 63; 1914, ch. 10, secs. 10, 11.\nThe memorandum of association certified by the registrar is in the case, but I do not find therein the certificate of incorporation.\nThe memorandum, by clause (c) thereof, states as follows:\u2014\n(c) The liability of the members is specially limited under section 63, CO., 1901, ch. 20.\nThe resolutions contained in \"Table A\" are excluded. The name and description of the company at the head of the memorandum indicate it falls, and was intended to fall, under section 63.\nThe objects specified therein are copied from the twelve objects specified in section 63a with one or two omissions in way of clerical errors, I think, in copying No. 1 thereof; and, in addition to No. 3 of the words\nespecially to refine oil and the by-products of petroleum.\nThis addition cannot help here and the omitted words in No. 1 rather weaken, if anything, the company's position herein.\nThen, these statutory objects are followed by five others which, in my opinion, in no way help, even if operative at all, the respondent in relation to what is involved herein. I shall presently set out these and deal with them in detail.\nI am quite clear that the whole purpose of the incorporation was to conform with the provisions of sections 63 and 63a in order to get the benefits thereof. The added objects must, therefore, be treated as null so far as, if at all, in conflict with the twelve objects specified in the section 63a.\nIf authority is needed for this proposition, see the somewhat analogous cases of Baring-Gould v. Sharpington Combined Pick and Shovel Syndicate[2]; Payne v. The Cork Co.[3]; where the articles of association were so attempted to be changed as thereby to conflict with or vary the statutory provisions protecting shareholders.\nCan any one read the contract in question herein and realize what the respondent was trying to do thereby and compare it with the evident scope and purpose of the entire section 63a without feeling that the respondent in embarking upon the business of a contractor for drilling wells for others was attempting something never contemplated as within the objects defined in that section.\nLet us read section 63a which prohibits the use of greater powers as follows:\u2014\n63a. Every company, the objects whereof are restricted as aforesaid, shall be deemed to have the following but, except as in this Ordinance otherwise expressed, no greater powers, that is to say * * *.\nSurely the language of these sections 63 and 63a exclude the possibility of anything else except the twelve specified objects which follow being intra vires the respondent's corporate powers.\nThe expression \"except as in this ordinance otherwise expressed\" is not, perhaps, all that it might have been, but clearly was intended to reserve to the company only such other powers as consistent with the existence of a corporate creation with limited objects to be pursued, and liability for the shareholders. Certainly other objects of pursuit were not intended to be reserved by this exception.\nThen, do these twelve specified objects cover the business of a contractor for hire, drilling upon the lands of others? The keynote of the whole series is found in the first, which reads as follows:\u2014\n1. To obtain by purchase, lease, hire, discovery, location, or otherwise, and hold within the province, mines, mineral claims, mineral leases, prospects, mining lands and mining rights of every description, and to work, develop, operate and turn the same to account and to sell or otherwise dispose of the same or any of them, or any interest therein.\nIt is a proprietary company that is contemplated thereby. True, when it comes to the business of smelting it may have to deal with the minerals of others and that is provided for. And, in relation to such like work or that done by its vessels, it can take compensation for work done.\nFrom beginning to end of the section there is only the very inapt expression \"to dig for\" that can by any straining of the language be made to fit what this contract involves.\nIt is a mining company, as the Act elsewhere expresses it, that is had in view, not a drilling company or contracting company, that is intended to be given these special powers.\nThe following passage condensed from judicial opinions, and appearing on page 9 of Buckley on Joint Stock Companies (9 ed.), in which I parenthetically incorporate his foot-note references, may be safely taken as our guide.\nThe memorandum of association of the company is its charter, and defines the limitation of its powers (per Cairns L.C., Ashbury Co. v. Riche[4], and the destination of its capital (Guinness v. Land Corporation of Ireland[5]). A statutory corporation created by Act of Parliament for a particular purpose is limited as to all its powers by the purposes of its incorporation as defined by that Act. The memorandum of association is under this Act the fundamental and (except in certain specified particulars) the unalterable law of companies incorporated by virtue of it. (Per Lord Selborne[6]..)\nBut the doctrine that any act ultra vires the memorandum is void is to be applied reasonably. Anything fairly incidental to the company's objects as defined is not (unless expressly prohibited) to be held as ultra vires (Attorney-General v. Great Eastern Railway Co.[7]; London and North Western Railway Co. v. Price[8]; Foster v. London, Chatham and Dover Railway Co.[9]; Attorney-General v. London County Council[10]; Attorney-General v. North Eastern Railway Co.[11]; Attorney-General V. Mersey Railway Co.[12]. * * *\nA contract made by the directors upon a matter not included in the memorandum is ultra vires' of the company and, therefore, of the directors. It is not binding on the company, and cannot be rendered binding even by the assent of every individual shareholder. (Ashbury Co. v. Riche[13]; Wenlook v. River Dee Co.[14].\nThe cases cited in support of these respective propositions amply bear them out.\nThe application of these authorities to the case in hand deserves some attentive care.\nThe learned Chief Justice of the court of appeal says\none of the objects of the plaintiff is to bore for oil as a contractor.\nI have read many times the objects as set forth in the memorandum of association to find what the court rests that upon. There is nothing of that kind expressed therein in so many words, and I assume it is an inference drawn from what does appear that is relied on.\nWith great respect I submit the inference is not well founded.\nThere is clearly contemplated in object No. 5 a conditional dealing, and in objects Nos. 8 and 9 a dealing with other companies. These, however, are far from being in the way of contracting to drill wells for others.\nI can, however, conceive in the manifold complications which might arise out of or incidental to such dealings, a need of power to contract for the drilling of a well. In the execution of such a purpose it might be fairly argued that it fell within the principle of what was involved in the cases of The Attorney-General v. The Great Eastern Railway Co.[15], or London and North Western Railway Co. v. Price & Son[16], or Foster v. London, Chatham and Dover Railway Co.[17], or Attorney-General v. The North Eastern Railway Co.[18], cited above.\nBut all these and analogous cases are very far from covering what is involved in this case and is broadly put as a right to bore for oil as a contractor.\nAll such incidental powers have to be interpreted reasonably. This case goes, in my opinion, far beyond what was held, for example, in the case of London County Council v. The Attorney-General[19], or the case of The Attorney-General v. Mersey Railway Co.[20] cited above.\nNumerous other cases are to be found drawing the distinction as to what is reasonably incidental. None I have been able to find reach as far as needed to support the respondent in this case.\nOne difficulty in finding authority directly bearing upon this case is the anomalous nature of the power given to create such a corporation as was, evidently, had in view in the amendment brought into the \"Companies Ordinance\" which is an Act founded upon and largely copied from the English \"Companies' Act,\" but which has no provision exactly like this amendment. It evidently stands by itself and must be treated as an attempt to enable the creation of corporations with the objects specified in 63(a) and not going beyond them.\nThe court of appeal suggests the company is incorporated by virtue of the, Act and the limitations of section 63 only affect the liability of the shareholders. I submit every company that is incorporated by virtue of such Acts as this is only incorporated for the objects set out in its memorandum of association, and as above authorities shew, cannot do any act as a corporation which goes beyond the scope and purposes of the expressed objects for which it has been incorporated, or that fairly incidental thereto.\nIf there is any room for misapprehension in this regard, besides what I have already said, and am about to say, I would call attention to the language of the 2nd sub-section of section. 63, which reads as follows:\u2014\n(2.) This amendment (1914, ch. 10, sec. 10[21]) shall apply to all companies heretofore incorporated under section 63 of the \"Companies Ordinance.\" 1914, ch. 10, sec. 10(2).\nThat shews the legislature assumed, so late as 1914, that the incorporation took place under section 63, and to make that clear amended the Act by section 63(a).\nThe case of Baroness Wenlock v. River. Dee Co. (1), and in appeal reported in the note thereto, pp. 675 et seq. (cited by Buckley for the support of his proposition lastly quoted above) furnishes something of value beyond the main point of ultra vires in its bearing upon the reliance put in the above extract from the judgment from the court of appeal for Alberta upon the certificate of incorporation. In that case the incorporation was by an Act of Parliament for a specific purpose empowering the borrowing upon mortgage of \u00a325,000. It borrowed more; and the power given the Lands Improvement Company (which lent the money) to advance was relied upon and especially by reason of a clause in one of its Acts making the certificate of the Inclosure Commissioners conclusive evidence of a valid charge under the Act.\nIt was held the certificate could not enlarge the powers of the defendant company and that the statutory validating certificate was of no avail.\nIt becomes us, therefore, I submit, not to rely upon the registrar's certificate of respondent's incorporation if it was that which he had no right in law to grant.\nAssuming for the moment that he presumed to certify otherwise than specially provided for in section 16, generally to the incorporation of a company as if unrestricted in its objects, when the parties were plainly proceeding by the express terms in the memorandum of association for the incorporation of a company limited as to the liability of its members by section 63, then he clearly did that which he had no warrant in law for doing.\nThere is no provision made for the incorporation of a company having this limited liability, had in view in section 63, with objects beyond those specified in section 63a, by the \"Companies Ordinance.\" And if that is to be taken as accomplished in this case, as the court of appeal has apparently taken it, then I have no hesitation in holding that there has been no incorporation of the respondent company and the appellant is entitled to succeed.\nIn such a case we ought to see that the law is not thus abused and to do so should give effect to the statement of defence in that regard and if not sufficiently explicit, leave to amend accordingly should be given as the court below should have done if necessary. As the company sues and in suing asserts its due incorporation, and that is sufficiently denied, there should be no need for amendment.\nI am not, however, for my part able to presume that any officer could venture upon giving any such unconditional certificate, but, on the contrary, presume that he gave a certificate in conformity with section 16 of the Act, which shewed the company to be limited in its character and powers by sections 63 and 63a.\nLest it may be said, though not so argued before us, that the words (in the second and third lines of section 63) \"the objects whereof are restricted to,\" etc., may render the foregoing reasoning inapplicable because there were five enumerated objects following the statutory twelve, and hence the objects not restricted, I will briefly examine same and indicate what I think the effect thereof.\nThey are as follows:\u2014\n(13) To obtain any provisional order or Act of Parliament for enabling the company to carry any of its objects into effect, or for effecting any modification of the company's constitution or for any purpose which may seem expedient, and to oppose any proceedings or applications which may seem calculated, directly or indirectly, to prejudice the company's interests.\n(14) To procure the company to be registered or recognized in any foreign country or place.\n(15) To sell, improve, manage, develop, exchange, lease, mortgage, dispose of, turn to account, or otherwise deal with all or any part of the property and rights of the company.\n(16) To do all or any of the above things as principals, agents, contractors, trustees or otherwise, and by or through trustees, agents or otherwise and either alone or in conjunction with others.\n(17) To do all such other things as are incidental or conducive to the attainment of the above objects.\nThese clearly add nothing to cover the business of a well borer and contractor. They also may be held if reasonably interpreted to add nothing but what might be implied in the foregoing statutory objects, Nos. 1 to 12 inclusive, as incidental thereto.\nThe first, however, is of the nature of what was held as to the articles of association in the cases cited on pp. 18 and 34 of Hamilton and Parker's Company Law, to be in conflict with the memorandum of association, and hence to be invalid. The same reasoning may render it futile here when the Act is looked at as a whole and its scope and purpose shewn.\nIf it refers to the Dominion Parliament it certainly seems out of place, and if to the Legislature of Alberta, still more so. The former should not interfere, but the latter can, and the subject matter does not seem to consist of what one would expect to find as the object of a corporation.\nNo. 14, the second of these, certainly is rather curious in light of the recent discussion so much agitated in the Companies' Case[22], and a curious commentary on, or display of ignorance of, all implied therein. Certainly it is otherwise of little use and possibly itself ultra vires.\nThe No. 15 seems also useless in light of the provisions of the statute. Again, however, I submit, if effective to take the company out of the operation of section 63, the result is the company never, was incorporated.\nThere is no place in this statute where the hybrid sort of thing having the combined objects of pursuit resting upon the other incorporating powers and also those in section 63 combined, is provided for.\nThese criticisms of what the supplementary objects may be worth are in my own view of the statute in a sense beside the question.\nLooked at comprehensively and endeavouring to give the statute a reasonable meaning in accord with its scope and purpose, there Is provided an incorporating power almost as extensive as the legislature had power to confer, and a procedure to accomplish such results as the power aims at.\nThen there is within that a power to incorporate, but only for specific objects named in section 63a with unusual powers suitable to the pursuit of such objects, but which the legislature deemed it inexpedient to confer on companies for the pursuit of other objects. If those seeking incorporation desired a general incorporation and did not desire such unusual powers, they could pursue the same objects in the ordinary way and subject to the law governing such methods.\nIt is left for the parties concerned to declare in their memorandum of association when proceeding to procure incorporation which of those distinctly different kinds of incorporation they wash to obtain.\nWhen they elect to obtain that proffered under section 63, they are limited to the objects named in section 63(a), and cannot add others.\nIf they specified others those others must be treated as null if in conflict with or expanding the objects so prescribed in section 63(a) of the statute.\nIf we will only apply reasoning analogous to that which Lord Cairns applied in the case of Ashbury Railway, etc., Co. v. Riche[23], cited above at 670 et seq, when he demonstrated the ambit of the memorandum of association to be the dominant factor for consideration and the articles of association in conflict therewith null I submit substituting statute for memorandum of association we may see that the inevitable result is any departure from statute or memorandum of association must be treated as null.\nIt so happens in my view that the memorandum of association is but an expression of that which is required by the statute as I interpret and construe it, and is required by the statute to be so expressed.\nThat being so these supplementary objects so called are of no effect, should never have been permitted if at all in conflict with those which preceded it copying the statute. And I am inclined to think they should not have been permitted.\nThe result of my construction would be, if acted upon here, to deprive respondent of its present judgment, but, if I understand the facts aright, the appellant has taken possession of the respondent's property by virtue of the terms of an ultra vires contract.\nThat contract is, 'by reason thereof, void, but that fact does not deprive it of its property even if acquired for use in a purpose ultra vires. And certainly it did not warrant appellant taking it and despoiling respondent thereof either temporarily or permanently. See the cases Ayres v. South Australian Banking Co.[24], at page 559; and National Telephone Co. v. Constables of St. Peter Port[25], at page 321. Cf. Great Eastern Railway Co. v. Turner[26].\nI think, therefore, the appeal should be allowed, but under the circumstances without costs, and the judgment below be vacated and judgment rendered for recovery of respondent's property in same plight and condition as when taken, but if that is impossible then there should be a reference to find and report for further consideration bearing upon the question of the property and the damages, if any, done same.\nThe following cases may, besides those cited above, usefully be referred to:\u2014\nBisgood v. Henderson's Transvaal Estates[27]; Attorney-General v. Frimley and Farnborough District Water Co.[28]; In re Crown Bank[29]; Pedlar v. Road Block Gold Mines of India[30]; Mayor, etc., of Westminster v, London and North Western Railway Co.[31]; Mann v. Edinburgh Northern Tramways Co.[32]; Simpson v. Westminster Palace Hotel Co.[33].\nDUFF J. (dissenting).\u2014I have come to the conclusion that the general words of section 63a of the \"Companies Ordinance\" in force in Alberta on the 16th May, 1914 (when the appellant company was incorporated) must be restricted by the application of the principle noscitur a sociis. The enactment was borrowed from the statute of British Colum- bia passed in 1897 in circumstances that are well known and with reference to companies carrying on operations which have no relation to exploring for or developing oil wells. The tenor of the enactment as a whole sufficiently indicates this. And, if I were called upon to construe the British Columbia statute, I should not have the slightest hesitation in holding that the Act does not apply to a company carrying on a business of the character which the appellant company appears to have been pursuing.\nI am not aware, however, that the question of the scope of the enactment had been passed upon by the courts of British Columbia before its adoption by the Alberta Legislature and the Alberta statute cannot, of course, be construed by reference to the circumstances in which, fifteen years before, the parent enactment was passed. It is stated as a fact, and not disputed, that, at the time the enactment was passed, oil had not been found in Alberta in conditions making the development of oil fields commercially profitable, and that circumstance may be given its proper weight. The ground, however, upon which I rest my construction of the statute is this: The words \"mining\" and \"mineral\" are words of very elastic meaning and they are words whose scope has frequently been retricted by the application of the principle noscitur a sociis. There is no technical difficulty in the way of so restricting this meaning as to exclude mineral oil and boring for oil; as the general scope of the enactment appears to indicate, with sufficient clearness, that they are not within the contemplation of it. Looking at section 63a as a whole, any lawyer experienced in such matters would immediately re- cognize that the objects of companies coming within the section are stated in language which is simply that of the common objects' clause in the memorandum of association of a metalliferous mining company. It is not so much from any single phrase or single clause or group of words as from the section as a whole that one draws the inference that such operations as those carried on by the appellant company are outside the contemplation of the section. The restrictive intent, to use the phrase of Holmes J., \"breathes from the pores\" of the enactment.\nThe question of substance is whether the judgment of the court below can be sustained on the ground stated in the reasons given by the learned Chief Justice. With great respect, I cannot accept the view to which the court below has given effect. The memorandum of association, by section 10 of the \"Companies Ordinance\" of Alberta, (ch. 61, \"Consolidated Ordinances,\" is a contract between the signers and the company. The dominating clause of the memorandum before us is, very clearly to my mind, clause (c) which declares in effect that the objects of the company are restricted to those objects authorized by section 63a. Every word of the objects' clause in the memorandum must, therefore, be read subject to the qualification\nproviding such objects are authorized by the true construction of section, 63(a).\nThe premise is negatived, therefore, upon which the court below proceeds., namely, that the objects stated in the memorandum go beyond the field within which companies governed by section 63a are permitted to operate, because whatever might be the meaning of the objects' clause taken by itself it cannot be given such a construction in view of the explicit declaration that the intent of the memorandum is that it shall not have that effect.\nThere are two reasons why I think this is the right way of reading the memorandum. In the first place there can be no doubt that what the parties at the time decided to do was to incorporate a company on the \"non-personal liability\" principle. The signers of the memorandum had their own protection to think of, they had the shareholders, with, whom they intended to associate themselves, to think of. The design was to represent the company to the world as a company incorporated on that principle, and I think we must impute to the signers an intention to execute a memorandum having the meaning and effect necessary to bring it within the scope of section 63a.\nSecondly. Any other view would make the statute a trap.\nThe amendment of 1914 admittedly cannot be invoked in this action.\nThe appeal should 'be allowed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The appellant asks us to hold that, although it is incorporated under the name\u2014\"The Dome Oil Company\"\u2014it is nevertheless not within the scope of its powers to seek for and win oil from its property, and that it is likewise ultra vires of the respondent, \"The Alberta Drilling Company,\" to undertake a contract to drill for oil on the appellant's lands. Counsel 'based this contention on the construction which he put on sections 63 and 63a of the ordinance of the North-West Territories respecting companies, made applicable to these litigants. He argued that oil is not a mineral within the meaning of section 63 and clauses 1 and 2 of section 63a, and that drilling for oil is not a process authorized by the latter clauses. In my opinion the construction contended for is too narrow. Rock oil is admittedly a mineral within definitions of that word well established and generally accepted. It was something well known as a mineral when the legislation under consideration was passed. There is nothing in the record to justify a finding, such as was made in the Farquharson Case[34], relied on by the appellant, that petroleum was not included in the sense in which the word \"mineral\" was used in the vernacular of the mining world and the commercial world at the date of the instrument under construction.\nNo sufficient reason has been advanced for excluding it from the purview of sections 63 and 63a. The word \"minerals\" in a statute bears its widest signification unless the context or the nature of the case requires it to be given a restricted meaning: Lord Provost and Magistrates of Glasgow v. Farie[35], at pages 690, 693; Hext v. Gill[36], at page 712; Earl of Jersey v. Guardians of the Poor of Neath Poon Law Union [37]; Ontario Natural Gas Co. v. Gosfield[38]. Here the use of the word \"minerals\" in juxtaposition with, but in contrast to, \"metallic substances\" affords a strong reason for giving to the former its widest meaning. Why should Parliament in enacting legislation dealing with minerals and mining matters be taken to have used the term \"min- erals\" subject to a restriction which it has not expressed ?\nThe word \"drilling\" is not found in the statute, but an 'authorized purpose of incorporation under clause 1 of section 63a is the winning or getting of mineral from the earth, and under clause 2 \"digging for\" and \"raising\" are means expressly authorized, and sufficiently comprehensive, I think, to include drilling, which is a method of digging for, with a view to raising oil.\nIt may be that the incorporation of a company subject to the provisions of section 63 upon a memorandum expressing wider purposes, but with the intent of confining its operations to the undertaking of drilling contracts upon properties not its own would be such a fraud on the statute as would justify the revocation of the incorporation. But fraud on the statute has not been suggested.\nI think it would be very dangerous to hold, as appears to be suggested in the judgment of the Appellate Division, that merely because some of the purposes and powers of a company expressly incorporated subjects to sections 63 and 63a happen to exceed what those provisions contemplate, its shareholders are to be denied the protection which section 63 affords and that section and section 63a are to be deemed inapplicable to it. I rather think the effect of section 63a is to restrict the powers of such a company within the limits which it prescribes notwithstanding any wider language used in the memorandum of association.\nMr. Ross next contended that if the respondent company had power itself to seek for and obtain oil, it had not the power to undertake to do so for another person or company; That again, in my opinion, is too narrow a construction and ignores the provisions of clause 2 of section 63(a) which extend to minerals, etc., \"whether belonging to the company or not.\" of clause 3, which authorize the carrying on of the business of mining, \"in all or any of its branches,\" and of clause 8, which provide for co-operation, etc.\nI am unable to assent to the argument that the existence of a debt by the respondent company for a portion of the purchase price of machinery placed by them on the appellant's lands\u2014a purely personal obligation\u2014constituted a breach of their covenant to place their machinery, etc., on the appellant's premises \"free of debt and of all and every lien and incumbrance.\" There was no lien or incumbrance charged upon the respondent's machinery; it was free of debt; a mere personal debt not creating a charge was, in my opinion, not within the scope of the covenant.\nI have found no reason to differ from the conclusion of the provincial courts that there had been no other default on the part of the respondent which would entitle the appellant company to seize under clause 10 of the contract.\nThe plaintiff's recovery of $5,000 was, I think, warranted, under clause 3 of the contract. The fact that the appellant had committed a wrongful breach of contract cannot, in the absence of an acceptance by the respondent of the breach as a termination of the contract, afford an answer to the appellant's absolute and unqualified undertaking that upon the respondents doing certain things (which they did) it would pay to them a fixed sum of money. The $250 allowed as damages for the wrongful seizure is not complained of.\nI would, for these reasons, dismiss this appeal with costs.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014The illegality of the seizure of the plant depended on questions of fact which have been found against the appellant company by the courts below. That finding was absolutely justified by the evidence and we must then decide that the seizure was illegal.\nThe appellants have to pay to the respondents damages for having stopped the work and for having, through that illegal seizure, prevented the respondents from carrying out their contract. The amount granted by the trial judge is perhaps calculated on a wrong basis, but the evidence justifies the amount which has been awarded.\nThe appellant now contends that the contract in question was ultra vires the appellant and the respondent companies. Those two companies were incorporated under the provisions of chapter 20 of the Ordinances of the North-West Territories of 1901 and of the amendments made thereto by the Legislature of Alberta.\nIt is not disputed that appellant and respondent companies could be legally formed under the provisions of that law for carrying out the oil operations for which they were respectively organized. But as their liability is limited by the mining sections of the Act, the appellants claim that the statute never contemplated including oil as a mineral substance. They rely mostly upon the judgment rendered by the Privy Council in the case of Barnard-Argue-Roth-Stearns Oil and Gas Co. v. Farquharson[39].\nIn that case, the Privy Council, in construing a deed of 1867 which reserved to the grantor mines and minerals, decided that natural gas was not included in that reservation, because\nat the date of the deed, natural gas had no commercial value and the parties thereto had no intention to except it as being a mine or mineral.\nThe section 63a we have to construe in this case was passed by the Legislature of Alberta at a time when the oil wells of that province were being exploited on a very large scale and it is to be presumed that the legislation was passed with a view of facilitating the development of that mining industry. In applying the principles laid down by the Privy Council in the above case, we must come to the conclusion that the legislature intended to include in the mining companies those dealing with rock oil.\nRock oil in its popular and scientific meaning is a mineral substance. Mineral bodies occur in three physical conditions, solid, liquid and gas; and although the term \"mineral\" is more frequently applied to substances containing metals, rock oil and petroleum are embraced in that term.\nUnited States v. Buffalo Natural Gas Fuel Co.[40]; Ontario Natural Gas Co. v. Gosfield[41], at pages 626-631.\nI have come to the conclusion that the companies could properly enter into the contract sued on and that the Obligations assumed by them can be enforced.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] 8 West.

Duff, Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA\nConstruction of statute\u2014Alberta \"Assignments Act\"\u2014Assignment for benefit of creditors\u2014Occupation of leased premises\u2014Liability of official assignee. The Alberta \"Assignments Act,\" as amended by the Alberta statutes, ch. 4, sec. 14 of 1909 and ch. 2, sec. 12 of 1912, provides that assignments for the general benefit of creditors must be made to an official assignee appointed under the Act and that the assignment shall vest in such assignee all the assignor's real and personal property, credits and effects which may be seized and sold under execution. The lessee of premises held under a lease from the plaintiffs made an assignment to the defendant who took possession thereof and, on threat of distress, agreed that he would guarantee the rent so long as he remained in occupation. After three months, the defendant quitted the premises and notified the landlord that he would no longer' be responsible for or pay the rent. In an action for breach of the covenants of the lease and to recover the rent accruing to the end of the term:\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed from (8 Alta. L.R. 226), Idington and. Brodeur JJ. dissenting, that by the effect of the assignment and entry into possession the term of the lease passed to the official assignee who, thereupon, became liable for the whole of the rent accruing for the remainder of the term.\nAppeal from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], reversing the judgment of Ives J., at the trial[2], and dismissing the plaintiffs' action with costs. The circumstances of the case are stated in the head-note.\nO. M. Biggar K.C. for the appellants.\nJ. S. Scrimgeour for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE. \u2014 This action is brought against the defendant as assignee of a lease to recover damages for alleged breach thereof. It is remarkable, therefore, to find that neither the agreement for the lease nor the assignment thereof is before the court.\nI am of opinion that this appeal must be allowed. The respondent is the assignee of the lease. If this had been a profitable holding, he could have disposed of it for the benefit of the estate and I do not under stand how, in the absence of statute, the rights of the lessors can be dependent on whether the lease is valuable in the hands of the official assignee or not. The fact that the English bankruptcy laws contain a provision enabling the trustee in bankruptcy to disclaim such a lease points, I apprehend, to the fact that without it the lessor's rights could not be dependent on its being of value to the bankrupt's estate in which case it would be retained by the trustee, or unprofitable when it would be disclaimed and the loss fall upon the lessor. It is, however, unnecessary to consider this, as the statute in the present case contains no such provision.\nI am disposed to think that the appellant could have pleaded this quality as official assignee and that his liability would then have been limited to the extent of the assets coming to his hands. This, however, he has not done, but has denied the assignment of the lease to him and this issue has been decided against him.\nHe must, I am afraid, abide by the consequences of a possibly mistaken defence and be held to his liability as assignee of the lease.\nThe appeal must be allowed with costs.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014The question this appeal raises must in the last analysis be whether or not an official assignee who is a public officer obliged by law to accept an assignment under the Alberta \"Assignments Act,\" is bound by the terms of that Act to accept an assignment vesting in him a leasehold of his assignor where by he inevitably must in such case become personally bound to fulfil the obligations of his assignor the lessee, to pay rent and otherwise.\nIt is clear law as result of such a tenure that one accepting the assignment thereof is bound by the law governing privity of estate and privity of contract to pay the rent and observe all the covenants running with the land by which his assignor was bound.\nIt is no answer to the naked question as I put it to say that he is pre-supposed to indemnify himself out of the estate for there may be no other estate than the term or at least no adequate estate out of which he can be so indemnified. Indeed, it may be impossible for him by careful examination to determine the question of fact relative to the existence of the means of indemnification until long after he has discharged his public duty as such official assignee by accepting the assignment.\nThe question must be resolved by the construction of the Act. And thus presented I think the right interpretation and construction thereof must be that it never was within the scope and purpose of the Act, which is the distribution equitably of the assignor's estate amongst the creditors, that such a consequence must follow the discharge of duty on the part of the officer as to involve him in undertaking such obligations.\nFrom that must flow the right and often the duty owing to those whom the Act was designed to benefit and protect and give a remedy for obtaining their claims against the debtor who is the assignor, or so much thereof as realizable, to inquire and determine whether or not it is to the advantage of those so concerned to accept the term.\nIt may be said, though the law denies the right of any one to vest in another against his will any estate tendered him, he usually is supposed to have allowed the vesting to take place by assenting to the grant thereof and that is so signified the moment he accepts an assignment under the Act.\nAll he in fact signifies is an acceptance of that which the statute contemplates should pass to him and which he is to receive in the way of real and personal estate belonging to the assignor out of which or by means of which the creditors may receive some benefit. The pre-supposition must be that he has vested in him and received only that which he reasonably can accept, no more and no less.\nIt is clearly the equitable distribution of the estate amongst the creditors, which is had in view, as the whole purpose of the Act.\nIt is surely not to be assumed that as a result thereof a lessor is to become entitled to receive at the expense of the other creditors full compensation for his claim as landlord and they go perhaps entirely bare.\nSuch a result would foe in conflict with not only the purpose of this Act but also in conflict with the law governing what landlords may be entitled to receive in the case of executions against their lessees.\nIt must not be overlooked that this method of dealing with insolvent estates is, as it were, in substitution for the costly and wasteful system of recovery by executions, in all such cases as the debtor chose to signify his assent thereto.\nI think this is one of the cases in which we must interpret and construe the statute by looking at the scope and purpose of the Act rather than at the letter of it which latter if strictly observed might frustrate the former.\nMoreover, I think the case is covered by the authority of the cases of Bourdillon v. Dalton[3], which, it is true, was only a nisi prius ruling of Lord Kenyon, but followed in the cases of Turner v. Richardson[4], and Copeland v. Stephens[5], decided en banc with Lord Ellenborough as Chief Justice. The former of these cases was decided before the \"Bankruptcy Act\" was so amended as to provide expressly for disclaimer of a lease by the assignee.\nThe latter was decided after that amendment.\nIt is to foe observed that, in each, Lord Ellenborough did not pretend to make much of the language of the enactments or found any distinction thereon.\nThe language he uses in the latter case, at pages 604 and 605, is singularly apposite to what we have in hand here.\nHis authority can never be lightly set aside and the principle upon which he proceeds would justify us in following his mode of treatment of what an assignment by the commissioners should be held to cover.\nIt occurred to me since the argument that the cases of the executors or administrators taking like assignment by operation of law might help to illustrate the principle applicable. A casual consideration of the reference thereto in Williams on Executors (10 ed.) page 1389, especially note (m), seems to indicate that the executor would not, unless entering and holding possession, incur personal liability.\nThis case having evidently received careful attention from counsel as well as the court below, and as the illustration I suggest was not put forward by any one, probably further investigation, which I have not time to make, would shew nothing is to be gained therefrom inasmuch as in the end the question must depend upon the construction of the statute with which I need not labour further.\nI agree with the inferences drawn and conclusions reached by the court of appeal upon the facts presented in evidence and need not repeat because concurring in same reasoning as adopted there.\nI may add that the case of Linton v. Imperial Hotel Co.[6], relied upon in argument in no way conflicts with the conclusion I reach.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.:\u2014It is difficult to state with precision the questions involved in this appeal without a rather full statement of the facts and some reference to the course of the proceedings in the Alberta courts. On the 31st of August, 1914, one C. R. McLachlan was the lessee of certain premises in Edmonton where he carried on a jeweller's business under lease from the owner, the appellant company. On the date mentioned McLachlan made an assignment for the benefit of his creditors, under the \"Assignments Act\" of Alberta, to the respondent. On the third of September the respondent was informed by the solicitor for the appellant company that if he would undertake as assignee to assure payment of the landlord's rental distress for rent could be avoided. On the 5th the respondent answered, as assignee, saying:\u2014\nI will guarantee your client's claim for rent as long as I continue to occupy the building.\nThe respondent appears to have, placed a man in possession who carried on the business for him until the beginning of December, towards the end of September an agreement having been entered into for a sale of the moveable assets en bloc to a firm of wholesale jewellers. About the same time the respondent had a conversation with Mr. Sherry, the president of the appellant company, in which Mr. Sherry was informed by the respondent that the rent would be paid as soon as the sale of the goods should be completed, Mr. Sherry, at the same time, informing the respondent that he intended to hold him as assignee of the lease for the rent during the residue of the term. In November, by arrangement between the respondent and the appellant company, the premises were rented at a rental of $ 110 a month to the purchaser of the goods, the understanding being that the rights of the appellant company were not to be prejudiced by the lease. On the 6th of November the respondent paid the rent for September, October and November and, on the 4th of December, he notified the appellant that he would not be responsible for any further rent in connection with the McLachlan estate.\nThe appellant company's case at the trial was that the respondent, having gone into possession as assignee of the lease among other effects of McLachlan, was responsible for the rent as assignee of the lease so long as the lease should continue vested in him. The respondent met this by denying that he was the assignee of the lease or that he had entered into possession of the premises.\nThere is a suggestion in the statement of defence that the respondent's occupation of the premises consisted merely in putting a man in charge of the goods there belonging to the McLachlan estate and that he was there under some agreement with the appellant company. The evidence, however, seems to shew clearly enough that the object of the arrangement was limited to avoiding a distress; it amounted to nothing more than this, that the appellant company would not distrain on the goods on the undertaking of the respondent to pay the rent so long as he occupied the premises. The learned trial judge found as a fact that the respondent took possession of the estate and entered into possession of the premises on the first of September. In appeal it was held that the assignee was not bound until he had done some act signifying his acceptance of the debtor's interest, that the entry into possession was only for the purpose of taking care of the goods, that the payment for rent was under a special agreement made with the lessor and that, consequently, there was no liability.\nThe first question to determine is whether or not the trial judge was right in finding that what was done, by the assignee was a taking possession under the lease. With great respect for the opinion of the court below, I am unable to feel any difficulty on that question. I think the position becomes clear when one looks at it from the point of view of the assignor, the original lessee. As between McLachlan and the respondent, would it be open to the respondent to aver that he had not taken possession of the premises under the lease? Nobody, of course, disputes the fact that the assignment was prima facie sufficient to pass the term. Assuming that the respondent was entitled to disclaim or that something must be' done by him to signify his acceptance of the lease, what is the proper interpretation of the respondent's conduct having regard to (let us assume it to have been) the offer by McLachlan, through the assignment, of the lease as one of his assets?\nAssuming it to be open, to the assignee to treat the instrument under which he took possession of the goods as making an offer as regards the lease which he was at liberty to accept or reject, was it open to him to say, at the end of November, after an occupation of the premises for three months, after payment of the rental during that period, I have not been in occupation under the lease, I have not accepted the lease, your grant of the goods in itself gave me by implication a licence to enter and to remain there until the goods were disposed of and the rental was only paid for the purpose of protecting the goods from distress? I must say, with great respect, that it appears to me to be sufficient only to state the proposition. To my mind, at all events, it is very clear that if the assignee intended to occupy other than under the lease he should have so declared in explicit terms before taking possession.\nThe Appellate Division seems to have proceeded upon the ground that occupation is to be attributed not to the exercise by the assignee of his rights under an assignment of the lease, but to a special arrangement with the landlord. Here the fallacy, with great respect, appears to be this. The landlord could only deal with the right of occupation of the property after cancelling or after a surrender of the lease. There is not a suggestion that there was any cancellation or surrender. The assignee's possession or occupation was, therefore, either wrongful or was an occupation under rights derived from McLachlan. Being capable of an explanation which makes it a rightful possession the assignee could not be heard to say that the possession was intentionally wrongful and in fact wrongful.\nBut the truth is, as I have indicated above, that nothing which happened between the landlord and the assignee justifies an inference to which effect could be given in a court of law that the assignee's occupation was in fact an occupation having its origin in some special arrangement with the landlord. What may have passed in the mind of the assignee is quite immaterial. One may, if one choose, guess that the assignee had no sufficient knowledge of his position. The assignee's legal position must be determined by what he did and what he did was simply this. He took possession of McLachlan's estate under and by virtue of an instrument which gave him the right to enter upon the premises in question and to occupy them as as- signee of a subsisting lease; he did enter and contented himself with making an arrangement with the landlord that the landlord should not distrain if he undertook to pay the rent as long as he occupied the premises. He contented himself with this without a suggestion on his part that he was entering into possession in any other character than that of assignee of the lease. I find nothing here upon which to erect an agreement between the landlord and the assignee amounting to a new tenancy involving either a wrongful possession or a surrender of the term.\nIn this view it is unnecessary to consider the general rule governing the position of the assignee with reference to the lease at the date when the assignment took effect. I may observe, however, that I am not by any means satisfied that the assignee was entitled to sever the assignment of the lease from the assignment of the stock of goods and treat the assignment of the stock of goods as giving him an implied right to enter upon the premises for the purpose of realizing upon them. It is not by any means to my mind an obvious proposition assuming that in general an assignee under the Alberta \"Assignments Act\" may elect whether or not he will accept leaseholds included in the estate. It is not by any means an obvious result from that, that where the trader who carries on business in premises occupied under a leasehold makes an assignment, the assignee can be allowed to say, when entering into possession for the purpose of realizing upon the goods, that he is entering under some other right than the right to which he is entitled by the express assignment of the lease. It is, however, not necessary to pass upon that point. I must add further that it is not entirely clear to me that the assignee under the Alberta \"Assignments Act\" is entitled to accept part of the property comprised in the assignment and to reject the remainder. It is not necessary to decade the point and I do not pass any opinion upon it, but there is one consideration which I think has, perhaps, been lost sight of. The \"Assignments Act\" of Alberta is substantially a reproduction of the Ontario statute, as is well known. On being attacked as infringing the exclusive Dominion jurisdiction respecting bankruptcy and insolvency that Act was construed as providing for assignments which are purely voluntary. I think it might be argued not without force that under an assignment by a debtor, which takes effect only as a voluntary assignment and which is an assignment of the whole of the debtor's property, it is not open to the assignee to defeat the debtor's intention by accepting the property in part and rejecting it in part. It may further be observed that there are several respects in which the analogy of the bankruptcy law may be misleading where the system in operation is not a true bankruptcy system. I think the appeal should be allowed.\nANGLIN J.\u2014By his plea the defendant admits the lease to his assignor sued upon and an assignment to him by the lessee for the benefit of creditors, pursuant to the Alberta \"Assignments Act,\" 1907, ch. 6, as amended 'by 1909, ch. 4, and 1913 (2nd sess.), ch. 2, sec. 12, of \"all the estate and effects,\" in the words of the Act, \"of the (assignor) which might be seized or taken in execution.\" Under sections 6 and 7 of the \"Assignments Act,\" such an assignment \"vests the estate * * * thereby assigned in the assignee therein named,\" if he be, as he was in this instance, an official assignee (sections 5). Under this legislation the vesting of the assigned property takes place without any act of acceptance by the assignee. Titterton v. Cooper[7], at pp. 483, 487, 490. He becomes and, in the absence of a provision for disclaimer such as is found in the English \"Bankruptcy Act\" of 1869 and in the \"Bankrupt Law Consolidation Act\" of 1849, he remains liable to the landlord, because of privity of estate with him, for the rent which accrues after the assignment under a lease so vested in him. Of that liability he can relieve himself either by obtaining a release from the landlord, or, as to the future, by putting an end to the privity of estate. White v. Hunt[8]; Hopkinson v. Lovering[9].\nIn the present instance the defendant has made no attempt to assign the lease and, although the privity of estate was terminated, pendente lite, by the landlord's making a lease to one Logan, that lease was made for the purpose of minimizing any claim that the plaintiffs might have against the defendant, and upon a distinct understanding, assented to by the defendant, that his liability, if any, should not be thereby affected except to the extent of reducing it by crediting him with rent payable by Logan. The case must, therefore, be dealt with on the footing that whatever privity of estate had been established between the assignee and the landlord continued until the expiration of the term.\nFor the defendant, it is urged, however, that an arrangement was come to between him and the plaintiffs by which they took him as tenant under a new lease for such period as he should require to occupy the premises in order to dispose of the assets of his assignor, and that they thereby accepted a surrender of, and avoided the lease now sued upon, and released him from liability under it. The judgment in appeal, however, is based on the view that, because of his official position and his inability to refuse the assignment, the defendant had an option to accept or to decline to take the lease in question; and what took place between the parties has been examined by the Appellate Division, not with a view to ascertaining whether it amounted to the making of a new lease involving a surrender of the existing term, but whether it established an election by the defendant to accept the existing lease. The cases relied upon by the learned judge who delivered the opinion of the court appear to have been decided upon the \"Bankruptcy Law\" as it existed in England under the statute 13 Eliz., ch. 7, which gave the commissioners\npower and authority to take by their discretions such order and direction with the property of the bankrupt, etc.\nBourdillon v. Dalton[10]; Turner v. Richardson[11], and Copeland v. Stephens[12], are perhaps the best examples of these authorities. As is pointed out in Cartwright v. Glover[13], at pp. 626-7, under that legislation \"nothing vested until the power was exercised,\" and cases decided upon it do not apply to an assignment made under a statute which explicitly enacts that such assignment shall vest the property assigned in the assignee, even though he should have no discretion to refuse the assignment. Crofts v. Pick [14]; Doe d. Palmer v. Andrews[15], at p. 355; Bishop v. Trustees of Bedford[16], at p. 716.\nAlthough the question as to the surrender of the existing lease and the acceptance by the landlord of the defendant as a tenant under a new lease was not as fully dealt with at the trial as could be desired\u2014probably because of the fact, as Mr. Biggar pointed out, that this defence is not explicitly pleaded\u2014I think the proper conclusion from the whole evidence \u2014especially from Mr. Sherry's explicit statement that every time he spoke to the defendant in connection with the rent, he told him that he intended to hold him for the full balance of the lease\u2014is that no such surrender took place, but that the defendant entered and took and held possession under the\" existing lease. It follows that he became liable for the rent sued for.\nThe appeal should, therefore, be allowed with costs here and in the Appellate Division, and the judgment of the learned trial judge should be restored.\nBRODEUR J. (dissenting).\u2014This is an action by a landlord against an official assignee for rent of premises leased to the insolvent.\nThe lease was made on the 12th November, 1913, and was for a term of two years. On the. 31st of August, 1914, the lessee assigned his estate for the benefit of his creditors under the provisions of the \"Assignments Act\" of Alberta (ch. 6 (1907)).\nThe assignee (the respondent) took possession of the premises and on the representations of the less that they were going to distrain for rent due by Mc- Laughlin unless he undertook, as an assignee, to secure payment of that rent, he answered that he would guarantee to pay the rent so long as he continued to occupy the premises.\nLater on, on the 2nd December, 1914, he informed the lessor that he would no longer be responsible because he was leaving the premises.\nIf it was an assignment under the common law, the case would not offer serious difficulties, because it seems to be well settled that where the assignee enters into possession of the premises without clearly disclaiming the lease he is supposed to accept the lease and to become bound by its covenant.\nBut it is a proceeding under the \"Assignments Act.\" By the provisions of that Act, the assignee is not a voluntary assignee, but insolvents are bound to make assignments to him of whatever estates they have. If these assignments could be made to anybody else, it may be that the provisions of the common law would still apply and that the assignee could be bound. But the acceptance of the assignment is not voluntary on his part. He has to receive the estate from the hands of the insolvents and everything is vested in him.\nHe must then proceed to the distribution of the estate according to the best interest of the creditors generally and the fact of claiming against him personally the rent seems to me contrary to the principles of that legislation.\nBesides, in this case, the lessor knew very well that he took the property and agreed to pay the rent only so long as he would be in possession. This seems to have been accepted by the appellants, the lessors, be- cause they did not carry out their intention of distraining. Then the liability ceased when the possession ceased.\nFor these reasons I think that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\n[1] 8 Alta.. L.K. 226.\n[2] 8 West.

Canadian Pacific Railway Co., (1916) 52 S.C.R. 605\nDate: 1916-02-01\nThe Continental Oil Company (Defendants) Appellants;\nand\nThe Canadian Pacific Railway Company (Plaintiffs) Respondents\n1915: October 28; 1916: February 1.\nPresent:\u2014Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Idington, Duff, Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA\nEsttoppel\u2014Principal and agent\u2014Receipt delivered before payment. The local agent of the railway company received the personal cheque of the defendants' agent in settlement of freight charges due by the defendants and thereupon receipted the freight bills. By means of these receipted bills the defendants' agent was enabled to obtain the amount of the freight charges from his employers and absconded, leaving no funds to meet his cheque which was dishonoured. In an action for the recovery of the amount of the freight charges,\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed from (8 Alta. L.R. 363), Duff and Brodeur JJ. dissenting, that the delivery of the receipts in advance of payment afforded means of inducing the defendants to pay over the amount represented by them to their agent and, consequently, the plaintiffs were estopped from denying actual receipt of payment of the freight charges.\nPer Duff J. dissenting.\u2014In the circumstances disclosed by the evidence in the case the principle of estoppel could not be applied. Gentles v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co. (14 Ont. L.R. 286), distinguished.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], affirming the judgment of McCarthy J., at the trial, by which the plaintiffs' action was maintained with costs.\nThe material circumstances of the case are stated in the head-note. Wallace Nesbitt K.C. for the appellants.\nO. M. Biggar K.C. and George A. Walker for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I agree with the judgment of Chief Justice Harvey in the Alberta Appellate Division and would allow this appeal.\nI was myself at first somewhat prejudiced in favour of the respondents by the fact that the appellants suspected their agent's honesty and did not communicate that fact to the respondents. There was, however, no occasion for the appellants to make any such communication. They did not hold their agent out to the respondents as a man to be trusted and were not bound to advertise any doubts they might entertain of his honesty to everyone with whom he had to do business. The action of the respondents would have been improper whether the agent was an honest or dishonest man.\nThe appellants made very proper and businesslike arrangements for the transaction of their affairs at their sales branch at Lethbridge. Not desiring to place a large sum of money at their agent's absolute disposal, they only placed in his hands, from time to time as required, a sum of $100 to meet petty disbursements and arranged that larger payments should be made at the local branch of the Molsons Bank whose drafts for such payments they would accept when forwarded with the receipted bill attached.\nSubsequently, at the request of their agent, the appellants wrote the Imperial Bank at Lethbridge that they would honour their agent's drafts when receipted railway bills were attached. I do not think the arrangements with the two banks differed materially. The appellants may have concluded that their agent had arranged with the Imperial Bank to pay these 'bills or had paid them himself, It was only material as far as the appellants were concerned that they should have been actually paid and what better evidence could be had of this than the receipted bills.\nI do not think it makes much difference whether the respondents gave the receipted bills for a mere personal post-dated cheque of the agent or on his assurance that he would pay the money subsequently. It was clearly not the correct thing to give receipts for the appellants' debts in exchange for a cheque which there was no reason to suppose he was authorized to give and which the respondents knew was of doubtful value as several cheques which he had previously given in similar manner, had been dishonoured. If any loss occurred through such irregularity the respondents must be prepared to accept the consequences of their own action.\nThe law governing the matter as it is to be gathered from decided cases is, I think, clear.\nIn the case of Graves v. Key[2], Lord Chief Justice Tenterden said:\u2014\nA receipt is an admission only, and the general rule is, that an admission, though evidence against the person who made it and those claiming under him, is not conclusive evidence, except as to the person who may have been induced by it to alter his condition; Straton v. Rastal[3]; Wyatt v. Marquis of Hertford[4]; Heane v. Rogers[5], at p. 586.\nIn the last mentioned case it was said:\u2014\nThere is no doubt but that the express admissions of a party to a suit, or admissions implied from his conduct, are evidence, and strong evidence, against him; but we think that he is at liberty to prove that such admissions were mistaken or were untrue, and is not estopped or concluded by them, unless another person has been induced by them to alter his condition; in such a case the party is estopped from disputing their truth with respect to that person * * * and that transaction.\nSee also the case of Irwine v. Watson[6], and Davison v. Donaldson[7].\nIt is impossible to suggest that the appellants made payment to their agent otherwise than on the faith of the receipted bills. The appellants were indisputably induced by these to alter their condition and the respondents are, therefore, estopped from disputing them with respect to the appellants.\nChief Justice Harvey refers to the case of Wyatt v. The Marquis of Hertford[8], in which the plaintiff recovered and says that the facts of that case are not very dissimilar to those of the present. What he means, no doubt, is that they are similar with the difference which, if it had been present in the former case, Lord Ellenborough pointed out would have discharged the defendant. This difference is far more emphasized in the present case for Lord Ellenborough can only suggest\nthat if it had appeared that the defendant had in the interval (i.e., between the giving by the steward of his cheque and its dishonour) inspected the steward's accounts and had in any manner dealt differently with him on the supposition that his demand had been satisfied as the receipt imported no doubt the defendant would have been discharged.\nIn the present case it is unquestionable that the defendant paid the draft on them solely on the supposition that the railway bills had been discharged as the receipts imported.\nThe appeal must be allowed with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014I so entirely agree herein with the opinion of Chief Justice Harvey, concurred in by Mr. Justice Scott in the court of appeal, that perhaps I should say no more than express my adoption thereof.\nIn deference to the argument here, I may, however, point out in addition to what has been so well said that when we are asked, for example, to hold the appellant company more to blame than the other, or that Willison was the agent of the appellant and it responsible for his misconduct, I cannot find in the evidence anything to support such positions.\nIt seems to me when any one departs so far from ordinary rules of business and common sense as to give any one receipts which he could use as Willison did\", the onus rests upon the party so acting to prove, to the hilt, that he had some reasonable ground, known to and furnished by the other party sought to be blamed, for taking such a course.\nI have sought in vain in the evidence to find any attempt made to shew anything of the kind, beyond the bare fact that Willison was \"a salesman and collector\" and that he is described in the statement of defence as \"manager\" at Lethbridge. What the term \"manager\" means is unexplained, except by the other phrase \"salesman and collector\" equally and perhaps still more indefinite.\nWhen any one relies upon the acts of an agent as binding his principal he must shew either that the agent has been directly authorized by his principal, to do what is relied upon, or that he has been employed by such party in such capacity as necessarily implies the authority to do so, or held out by the principal in some way as having it. Strangers to the actual terms of an agent's engagement, knowing only what the principal may be reasonably presumed to have recognized, may become entitled to say the agent had been held out as having the ostensible authority of his principal for doing as he did. That is not this case.\nWe have before us the uncontradicted evidence on behalf of appellant as to what 'both the actual authority was and recognized course of conduct or dealing was so far as shewn; and nothing therein is shewn to justify respondent in acting as it did.\nAnd when it comes to a description of this alleged agent's capacity, it is about as illuminating as if one tried to hold a municipality, for example, liable for the acts of the manager of the town pump if he presumed to act as tax collector. The term \"manager\" is applied as descriptive of so many things now, that we must ask in what sense it is used and then we are back to the recognized course of conduct which, so far as the evidence goes, fails herein to help.\nI should be inclined to suspect that the agent, Willison, was merely a canvasser for customers to buy oil, and a collector to get in proceeds of such sales and deposit in the bank such proceeds. For his conduct in this latter regard the appellant relied on a fidelity insurance bond.\nAnd as to the specific business out of which this action arises, he had been in fact so fenced in and guarded against, and his authority so limited that it was hard to conceive how, if respondent's agents acted with ordinary sense, he could have defrauded any one.\nAs to the method of carrying out this very limited authority, I should have desired to know a great deal more than we are told. For example, we have nothing to guide us as to the ordinary course of handling weekly freight bills. Was the railway agent accustomed to call on such customers to receive payment? Or was the shipper expected to call on the freight agent? Again; why was Willison's own personal cheque ever taken? And above all things why was it taken after it had been once protested, and more than once found no good, and no report made to his employers, especially in light of the terms of the latter granting a weekly credit which ended thus:\u2014\nWish to advise you that Mr. Ogden has granted your company a weekly credit account at this station.\nOur weeks close the 7th, 14th, 21st and last day of each month. It is absolutely necessary that payment of your account be made on these days, otherwise, credit will be immediately discontinued.\nYours truly,\nS. E. Mitchell, Agent.\nThis omission to act promptly should have been explained; especially in face of the positive evidence of Wilbert, the secretary-treasurer of appellant, who seems never to have heard of such remarkable conduct as had been carried on by Willison to the knowledge and detriment of respondent, without complaint.\nThen Wilbert says:\u2014\nQ. How were those to be treated ?\nA. Our arrangement was with the bills of large amount that the railway company take the freight bills to the bank and get their money and the bank in turn should draw on us. Willison would O.K. the bills, get a draft on us and we would honour the draft provided the freight bills were receipted and in order. That implies the agent of respondent was to do what he did not apparently do and the matter rests there.\nAnd the evidence from Long, the respondent's local freight agent, is as follows:\u2014\nQ. Have you any instructions from your company to accept personal cheques?\nA. I do not think that the company would have any objection so long as the cheque was O.K.\nQ. Have you any instructions that would allow you to accept a personal cheque and give receipted bills to a company for their freight?\nA. No, we have no instructions to that effect.\nQ. You had taken personal cheque from Mr. Willison before?\nA. Well, I cannot just say whether his cheque were made out similar to that.\nQ. Which were protested?\nA. Yes, we had several which were protested.\nQ. So that you knew his cheques were not liable to be good?\nA. Well, we figured the Continental Oil Co. were good enough when we granted them that weekly credit.\nQ. So that you could afford to take personal cheques and sign receipts and turn them over.\nA.. Well, the receipts were just given in the ordinary way, the same as this cheque here.\nQ. But you had several cheques of Mr. Willison's turned down?\nA. Yes, several had been turned down.\nQ. Then when you received a cheque like that what did you do with it?\nA. Remitted it to Winnipeg.\nEvidently he had no right to act as he did in taking these uncertified personal cheques which turned out so often worthless.\nIf it had been brought out in evidence that this course of dealing was known and recognized and tolerated by the appellant, there should then have been an end of the defence.\nNo attempt was made to do so. If the onus rested on appellant, it, of course, should have explained all these and many other things. But in my view the onus resting upon respondent has not been discharged.\nHow then can respondent seek to shift the onus resting upon it under such circumstances; or blame the other company instead of its own agents for trusting one so evidently untrustworthy?\nI do not think this is a case wherein such authorities as Lloyd v. Grace, Smith & Co. [9] can be relied upon as at all applicable. They never were intended to protect people discarding the ordinary rules or precautions of business men, as the respondent did in handing over to such an untrustworthy instrument as the agents of the respondent knew Willison to be from their own experience of him.\nThe authorities needed to be relied upon apart from all this appear in the opinion of Chief Justice Harvey.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs throughout.\nDUFF J. (dissenting).\u2014I concur in the conclusion of the learned trial judge, Mr. Justice McCarthy, as well as in the (reasoning upon which his conclusion is based; the litigation, however, has given rise to much difference of judicial opinion and it is perhaps desirable that I should put in my own way the considerations which more particularly influence my mind.\nThe appellants had their head office at Winnipeg, had branches in Alberta, and, among other places, at Lethbridge, where they were represented by one Willison. They had with the respondent company what is known as a weekly credit account according to which shipments were received and delivered for them without concurrent payment of the freight charges, settlements being made weekly. The action is brought for charges on certain shipments in August and September, 1912. It is not disputed that the charges were properly earned and lawfully payable and it is admitted that, in fact, they have not been paid; the appellants' defence to the action being that by reason of certain dealings between their agent Willison and the respondent company (by which it is alleged that the appellants were induced to settle with Willison on the footing of the charges having been paid by him) the respondent company is estopped from denying that they were in fact paid.\nOn the 21st September, 1912, Willison gave the respondent company his cheque for the amount of these charges, which was afterwards dishonoured and which, for the present, may conveniently be referred to as his personal cheque. This cheque was given in exchange for the freight bills receipted; and these receipted freight bills were attached by Willison to a draft which was discounted by the Imperial Bank and paid by the appellants, the proceeds being placed to Willison's credit. Willison is described in the statement of defence as the appellants' manager at Lethbridge, and whatever limitations were in fact imposed upon Willison's liberty of action by instructions from the appellants, it is not, I think, open to doubt that Willison's apparent status was that of local manager of their business. He was salesman for the district, he was collector in the district, he incurred debts on 'behalf of his principals and paid them. It is quite true that the moneys collected by him were de- posited in an account in the appellants' name and he had no authority to draw on that account. But although Willison was not in the habit of signing cheques in the appellants' name it is, I think, a fair description of his apparent relation to the appellants as disclosed by the evidence to say, as the statement of defence says, that he was their local manager. Willison, as the learned trial judge has found, was in the habit of paying debts incurred by him on behalf of the appellants by cheques drawn upon an account standing in his own name. This course of business had the sanction of the appellants who remitted him from time to time sums of money to be applied by him in payment of what are called petty cash accounts.\nIt is also established that, in fact, the weekly settlement of freight charges was made by cheques drawn by Willison on this account. For the present it is immaterial, but I shall give my reasons later for thinking that the appellants have not given convincing evidence to shew that this course of business was not known to, and (at least impliedly) sanctioned by them. Evidence is given, remarkable for vagueness, which is relied upon by the respondents as shewing that Willison was strictly limited by his instructions to pay these freight bills by a particular method and that these instructions were adopted for the purpose of protecting the appellants against Willison's possible frauds and that the appellants were deprived of this protection by the loose methods of the respondent company which enabled Willison to make use of the receipted bills for the purpose of defrauding his principals. This contention I shall have to analyze and comment on in detail; I mention it now for the purpose of saying that, at this point, it is immaterial because the first stage in the examination of the appellants' contention is to ascertain whether or not in view of Willison's position as it appeared to the world, the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, as reasonable people of business, ought to have known that the delivery to Willison of the receipted freight bills in exchange for his cheque was calculated to lead the appellants into the belief either that the freight bills had been paid in actual cash or that the railway company had elected to look to Willison instead of the appellants as their debtor. This question is, of course, a question of fact, the onus being on the appellants to establish the proposition that the conduct of the respondent company was calculated to mislead them\u2014this being as I have said the first essential step in the progress of their argument.\nI think that question must be answered in the negative. Having regard to the position of Willison the, respondent company was, I think, entitled to assume that, in paying by cheque in the way he did pay weekly during the period of about a year's duration, he acted entirely in conformity with his duty as agent of the appellants and, consequently, that his act in paying in that particular way was the appellants' act. I say I think the respondent company was entitled to assume that, for this reason, considerable sums of money such as the amount sued for here are not in the ordinary course of business paid in currency or bank notes. The respondent company was, of course, entitled to assume that some provision for the payment of the freight bills had been made by the appellants and they would be entitled to assume as a matter of business that nobody else \"(the Molsons Bank, for example) had been made the agent for the purpose of making such payments; and they were equally entitled to assume that the appellants must be aware that the payments were not being made out of any account standing in the appellants' own name.\nThat being so, I confess I am quite unable to understand why anybody in the position of the respondent company ought to have supposed that delivery of the receipted bills could in any way mislead the appellants. On the assumption on which, I repeat, the respondent company was entitled to proceed that the appellants were aware of the practice followed by Willison, the delivery of the receipted bills could signify nothing but the fact that Willison's cheque had been accepted as conditional payment in the usual course.\nThere is another way of putting the respondent company's case and it is this\u2014Willison being the ostensible agent of the appellants what he did within the scope of his ostensible agency, which as I have pointed out extended to payment in the manner in which he did pay, and what came to his knowledge as arising out of the dealings in the execution of his ostensible authority were the acts and the knowledge of the appellants themselves. The appellants, in other words, through Willison, knew the facts; consequently there could be no question of estoppel. This way of putting the case might not be so convincing if it had appeared that the plan of paying with his own cheque was a plan concocted in his own interest for the purpose of enabling him to commit fraud upon the company. There is not the slightest ground for any such suggestion and I shall proceed to give my reasons for thinking that the respondents have quite failed to satisfy the onus on them of shewing that they were not in fact aware of the course of business followed by Willison \u2014the onus being, of course, upon them.\nTo come then to the last mentioned point. The chief evidence is that of Wilbert, the secretary-treasurer of the appellants, which must be examined with some care in view of the general terms and, I am afraid, convenient vagueness in which it is expressed. This witness, no doubt, uses language which is capable of being read as amounting to an asseveration that for the purpose of protecting themselves against the possible dishonesty of Willison, the appellants had instructed Willison and the Molsons Bank that all payments made by the respondent company for freight bils were to be made by the bank to the respondent company on behalf of the appellants and covered by a draft upon them. Willison's functions were to be limited according to this interpretation of the evidence to the production of the receipted freight bills and passing them as correct. This evidence was not contradicted, but, when read as a whole, it is far from unequivocal and, I think, the overwhelming weight of probability stands against it if read in this sense and that the appellants, on whom the burden of establishing the issue lies, have failed satisfactorily to shew that such instructions were given either to Willison or to the bank. The point of the secretary's story (according to the interpretation relied upon) is, of course, that the instructions specifically provided that the payment of freight bills was to be made by the bank and not by Willison. Against this there are some very significant facts; there is the fact, in the first place, that the railway company was never informed that payments of its freight bills were to be made by the agents of the Molsons Bank on behalf of the appellants and not by their own local manager. There is the circumstance that, as the learned trial judge has found, no payment to the railway company was in fact made toy the bank, and one gathers from the evidence that no draft was ever drawn by the bank on the appellants. There is the fact also that the local manager of the bank was called by the appellants and gave evidence as to instructions respecting their bank account and the correspondence between the appellants and the bank is produced; nevertheless the bank manager (who according to this theory was appointed their agent for the purpose of making these payments) is not examined as to any instructions received by him touching this subject. There is the fact that in September, 1912, when inquiries were made by the Imperial Bank (at the suggestion of Willison be it observed) the Imperial Bank is told the drafts with accepted freight bills attached may be discounted and will be paid on presentation to the respondents. The precaution is not that freight bills should be paid by the bank to the respondent company, but that the agent's draft should be discounted only on the condition that the receipted freight bills were attached. No suggestion is offered in the evidence to explain why, if the appellants had appointed Molsons Bank for the reasons suggested, they should be so readily have given the instructions that were given to the Imperial Bank which contemplated payment by the agent himself. The truth is that when one comes to read Wilbert's evidence closely one finds that his mind is far from fixed upon the point that the bank was to make the payments, or that any other precaution was to be taken by the bank other than seeing that receipted freight bills were produced. When he is asked the question whether the appellants had any knowledge that Wilbert was paying freight by his private cheque, he answers:\u2014\nWell, we knew he had to handle it some way; we didn't know whether he used his cheque or whether the bank turned it over to the company, our instructions were to pay it to the company.\nHe says again that the instructions given to the Molsons Bank were the same as those given to the Imperial Bank.\nHe adds in another place, \"the bank was to see to it.\" The impression one gets from the evidence as a whole, assuming that it can be relied upon at all in the absence of any particulars and in view of the fact that the local manager of the bank was not examined on the point, is that it was left to the local manager of the bank to exercise his discretion as to the manner in which payment was made to the respondent company. If that were in truth the state of affairs it would follow that the local bank manager was put in the place of the appellants to superintend the appellants' local manager in respect of these payments and, consequently, that what the manager of the bank did in the matter was done by the appellants and what the manager of the bank approved was approved by the appellants and, consequently, that the act of their local manager in paying by his own cheque was the act of the appellants. It would follow that, down to the time of the particular payment now in question, the local manager of the appellants had, with the permission of the appellants, been paying the appellants' obligations validly incurred by him with his own cheques; in other words, to pay such obligations with his own cheque was within the scope of his ostensible authority and, therefore, binding on the appellants as their act notwithstanding any private instructions to the contrary.\nTo sum up, the defence of estoppel fails for want of satisfactory evidence to shew that, in the circumstances, a receipt amounted to a representation to the effect contended for; secondly, what was done by the local manager was done within the scope of his ostensible authority and was, therefore, an act of the appellants.\nA word only as to the decisions relied upon. The truth of the matter is that this appeal involves no question of law. It is simply a question of an application of the principle of estoppel. The disputed questions are questions of fact. The cases referred to really have no bearing except as illustrations of the principle. In Gentles v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[10], for example, the Court of Appeal held that the receipts given were calculated to mislead the principal into thinking and, in fact, did so mislead him, that the accounts had been paid and that he was induced thereby to settle with the agent on that basis. In fact in that case it was not disputed, as the learned trial judge points out, that the receipts were given with that very object. The conclusion of the Court of Appeal was strictly a conclusion of fact and the decision is strictly not within the category of judicial precedent. When the facts of the case are looked at particularly with reference to the status of the agent one sees, beneath a superficial similarity, differences between that case and this which are of decisive importance in their bearing upon that particular point. It cannot help us at all in the decision of this case to consider whether or not, if one had had facts of that character to deal with, one would have come to the same conclusion as the Court of Appeal.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014I concur in the opinion of my Lord the Chief Justice and would only add that this case seems tome to fall within the language of Lord Cranworth in Jorden v. Money[11], at pages 210, 212, quoted by Lord Macnaghten in Balkis Consolidated Company v. Tomkinson[12], at page 410.\nBRODEUR J. (dissenting).\u2014A misappropriation of funds has been made by the manager of the branch office of the appellant company at Lethbridge to the detriment of the respondents and we have to determine which of the appellant or the respondent companies should stand the loss.\nThe facts are these: The appellant company opened a branch office in Lethbridge and appointed as their manager, as they are calling him in their statement of defence, a man named Willison. They were shipping oil by the Canadian Pacific Railway from and to that place and the freight charges were to be paid at Lethbridge every week. When the charges were small they could be paid by the personal cheque of Willison drawn upon his small credit account provided by the appellant. But, in the case of large freight bills, the appellant company made with the Molsons Bank at Lethbridge an arrangement by which the railway company should take the freight bills to the bank, get their money and the bank in turn should draw upon them with the receipted bills attached. Those bills had to be vouched by Willison.\nIf that arrangement had been carried out there would have been no loss of money. But the oil company failed, which is on its part a very gross piece of negligence, to notify the railway company of that arrangement and then the bills, whether small or large, were paid by the personal cheque of Willison.\nLater on, it is not very clear at whose request, the banking arrangements for the payment of those bills were transferred to the branch of the Imperial Bank at Lethbridge. But this time instead of having drafts drawn by the bank itself, it was stipulated that the drafts would be made by Willison himself with the freight bills attached and vouched for by him.\nThis new arrangement also was not communicated to the railway company. So the railway company continued every week to present its bills to the branch office of the oil company at Lethbridge and was receiving Willison's cheques in payment.\nOn the 21st September, 1912, a cheque of $1,412.92 was given by Willison, the bills were receipted and handed to him, and with those bills so receipted, without, of course, the knowledge of the Canadian Pacific Railway Co., he drew a draft through the Imperial Bank on his principals.\nThe amount was put to his credit but was withdrawn by him since; when his cheque came from the Canadian Pacific Railway Company's Winnipeg office, there were no more funds and the man had disappeared.\nThe question then is: Who is to be liable for that fraud of Willison? It seems to me that the oil 'company has been acting negligently in not mentioning to the railway company the arrangements which had been made for the payment of those freight bills. The arrangements were certainly good ones; but it was not sufficient to make them, but the railway company should have been notified as to their existence and the way they wanted those bills paid.\nSince they had no confidence in their manager, they should have been very careful to see that he would not defraud them or the railway company.\nIt has been decided by the House of Lords in the case of Lloyd v. Grace, Smith & Co.[13] that a principal was responsible for the fraud committed by his representative in the course of his employment.\nIt seems to me only fair that in a case of that kind the principals should be responsible for the misdeeds of their agents, unless there is negligence on the part of the other party or unless that party has by words, or conduct, made a representation of fact either with a knowledge of its falsehood or with the intention that it should be acted upon. Those elements cannot be found in this case and it seems to me inequitable without discussing the cases which have been so fully discussed in the judgment of the courts below, that the railway company should lose in those circumstances.\nFor these reasons the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\n[1] 8 Alta.

Lands which, at the time of the transaction, would be exempted from seizure and sale under execution by the Alberta \"Exemptions Ordinance\" were purchased by S. and, with the intention of protecting them from pursuit by his judgment creditor, he caused them to be conveyed to his wife, on a parol agreement with her that the title should remain in her name until the judgment debt was satisfied. The debt was subsequently paid by S. and he brought suit against his wife for a declaration that she held the lands in trust for him and for reconveyance.\nHeld per curiam\u2014That the court should not grant relief to the husband against the consequence of his unlawful attempt to delay and hinder his creditor, although the illegal purpose had not been carried out. Mucklestone v. Brown (6 Ves. 68); Taylor v. Chester (L.R. 4 Q.B. 309); followed. Rochefoucauld v. Bousted ((1397), 1 Ch. 196) referred to. Judgment appealed from (8 Alta. L.R. 417), reversed, Anglin J. dissenting on the ground that the conveyance of exempted lands could not prejudice the rights of creditors and, although it had been made with fraudulent intent, it was not fraudulent as against them. Mundell v. Tinkis (6 O.K. 625); Mathews v. Feaver (1 Cox 278); Rider v. Kidder (10 Ves. 360); Day v. Day (17 Out. App. R. 157); Symes v. Hughes (L.R. 9 Eq. 475), and Taylor v. Bowers (1 Q.B.D. 291), referred to.\nPer Duff J.\u2014In the absence of proof that his creditor had not been prejudiced in consequence of the conveyance being taken in the name of his wife the plaintiff was not entitled to relief. APPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], whereby, on equal division of opinion among the judges, the judgment of Scott J., at the trial [2] stood affirmed.\nThe circumstances of the case are stated in the head-note and the questions raised on this appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nF. Ford K.C. for the appellant.\nO. M. Biggar K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2014I think the appeal should be allowed.\nThe trial judge has found that the evidence does not establish a valid agreement between the parties for the reconveyance of the property to the respondent. The respondent in such a case as this can, of course, ask nothing from the court but his strict rights. There seems to me nothing necessarily inconsistent between the idea of his making an absolute gift to his wife and the fact of his having given her the property to keep it from his creditors. The appellant says that the reason for the gift was \"because he lose it anyhow.\" I think that, as between themselves, the presumption of law that the gift to the wife was an absolute one is not rebutted.\nBut if it were necessary to hold that there was a resulting trust, in favour of the respondent, I do not think he is in a position to ask the court to enforce it. He can only make out his case by alleging his own unlawful intentions in making the conveyance to his wife. In the case of Muckleston v. Brown [3] at page 68, the Lard Chancellor said:\u2014\nCottington v. Fletcher [4] does not affect this case. That cage was upon the grant of an advowson contrary to the policy of the law, by a roman catholic in trust for himself. Afterwards he turns protestant; and desires a discovery as to his own act. The defendant put in a plea of the Statute of Frauds; but by answer admitted the trust. Lord Hardwicke is made to say, that upon the admission he would act. I do not know whether he did act upon it; but it is questionable whether he should; for there is a great difference between the case of an heir coming to be relieved against the act of his ancestor, in fraud of the law, and of a man coming upon his own act under such circumstances.\nIt is there said it might be different if it had come on upon demurrer. The reason given is that, as this assignment was done in fraud of the law, and merely in order to evade the statutes, it was doubtful whether at the hearing the plaintiff could be relieved. Lord Hardwicke means to say that, if the defendant admits the trust, though against the policy of the law, he would relieve, but if he does not admit the trust, but demurs, he would do what does not apply in the least to this case. The plaintiff stating he had been guilty of a fraud upon the law to evade, to disappoint, the provision of the legislature, to which he is bound to submit, and coming to equity to be relieved against his own act, and the defence being dishonest, between the two species of dishonesty the court would not act; but would say, \"Let the estate lie, where it falls.\" That is not this case.\nIt will be observed that the Lord Chancellor considered it questionable whether the plaintiff ought to have relief even in a case where the defendant admits the trust. In the present case the appellant has denied the trust.\nI am prepared to hold that a plaintiff is not entitled to come into court and ask to be relieved of the consequences of his actions done with intent to violate the law, and that though they did not and even could not succeed in such purpose.\nI think the maxim quoted by Lord Eldon applies in this case and that the court should say \"Let the estate lie, where it falls.\"\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The respondent, as plaintiff, alleges in his statement of claim that the defendant, now appellant, who is his wife, was the registered owner of lands described therein but held the same as trustee for him, the plaintiff.\nHe proceeds in said statement of claim to allege that she, in breach of her said trust, sold the lands and he seeks a declaration of the trust and judgment for the part of the purchase-money she got and other relief.\nThe lands I will assume, as the learned trial judge has found as a fact, were bought with respondent's money, but the conveyance taken to the appellant when his wife.\nUnder such a naked state of facts the presumption of law would be that she received 'Same by way of advancement. In short she, in law, thereby became the owner unless proven by other facts she was a trustee.\nThere was no writing or other evidence of a legal trust upon which he could rely. Therefore, he was of necessity, in order to establish his claim that she was his trustee, driven to prove that he had procured the conveyance to be made to his wife lest a creditor or creditors should reach the land if in his name and that the like reason had obtained for the vesting in her of other property out of the proceeds of the sale of which the land in question was paid for or improved.\nMany authorities have been cited which I have, in deference to the argument and divided opinions be- low, fully considered. But from none of them can I extract authority for the proposition of law that when a man has, out of the sheer necessity to prove anything upon which he can hope to rest the alleged claim of trust, to tell of an illegal purpose as the very basis of his claim, that he may yet be entitled to succeed. 1 find cases where the man has, accidentally as it were, or incidentally, to the relation of his story told that which he might if skilfully directed both in pleading and in giving evidence have avoided telling, yet has told enough to disclose that he was far from being always guided by the law or morality in his intentions, and still entitled to succeed because he had in fact established, by the untainted part of his story as it were, enough to entitle him to succeed without reliance upon that which was either illegal or immoral.\nThis is not respondent's case, but the other kind of case I have just referred to is.\nOut of the many cases on the subject Taylor v. Chester [5] furnishes the law applicable to this case, and the case of Taylor v. Bowers [6] furnishes an apt illustration of the other kind of case.\nIn this latter all Taylor need have done was to prove that the goods in question were his and they were found in the possession of the defendant who had never bought them or acquired any honest title thereto.\nThe plaintiff there had never executed the intended assignment in fraud of creditors or any other and if the defendant had set up the facts he relied upon his defence would have been held illegal. That much is got from an examination of the facts noted and judgments in the case and especially from those in appeal.\nThe more recent case of Kearley v. Thomson [7] shews some things said by even eminent authority in the case I have just referred to may not be law.\nHad the conveyance been made to a stranger, under such facts and circumstances as might have enabled the respondent to present and rely upon the naked fact of his purchase and payment of the price as producing a resulting trust which the law would imply, the respondent might thereby have escaped telling of his own illegal purpose and succeeded. Here he has to tell the facts disclosing the illegal purpose as his chief, and indeed only, motive for constituting the trust he claims to have existed, and rely thereon, and cannot, as I view the law, successfully do so.\nThe cases of Sims v. Thomas[8], and Symes v. Hughes[9], certainly fall far short of covering this. The real question of law involved and decided in the former was the non-exigibility of the asset in question and the right to sue in such case upon the bond in question despite the provision of an insolvency Act not framed to reach it.\nThe latter case certainly is not to be extended and it needs extension to cover this case even if binding us, as it does not.\nAll that was argued and well presented as to the operation of the \"Exemptions Ordinance\" seems, from my view of the law, -as applicable to the facts herein irrelevant. On the law and facts the property was hers and the exemption relative thereto hers also.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs throughout, and the action dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014In 1908, the respondent, who was the husband of the appellant, purchased land in Edmonton for which he agreed to pay $700. Shortly afterwards he built a house at a cost of $600 and, from that time until 1912, the appellant and the respondent occupied the property as their home with their children. On the completion of the purchase, in 1907, the transfer was taken in the name of the appellant and, in 1912, during the respondent's absence in the United States the appellant sold the property at the price of $3,500; $2,000 having been paid in cash and the respondent, on discovering the sale, brought the action out of which this appeal arises claiming the property was his and consequently the residue of the purchase price, $1,500 still in the vendee's hands.\nThe respondent puts his case in this way. He says that the purchase money was paid by him under the agreement of 1907; that the house was built partly by his own labour and partly by labour and materials provided by him; that the transfer was taken to his wife by arrangement between them, the effect of which was that she should hold the property as trustee for him.\nOn behalf of the appellant it is not disputed that she was to hold the property as trustee for the respondent; but it is said that the explicit arrangement was that the property was to be held by her until a certain debt for the payment of which the respondent was then being pressed had been discharged and that the intention of both parties in making the transfer to the wife instead of to the husband was to conceal the fact that the husband was the owner and in that way to protect the property from proceedings by a creditor who, at the time the transfer was taken, had recovered judgment.\nThe appellant denies that the property was paid for with the respondent's money, but on that point the finding is against the appellant and this appeal must, I think, be decided on the footing that the finding is right.\nIt is not, I think, seriously open to question that the respondent could only succeed by producing evidence shewing that in directing the transfer to be made to his wife an advancement to her was not intended and the evidence which establishes this is precisely the evidence which shews that the title vested in the wife was intended as a cloak to protect the property from the creditor mentioned. The respondent's case, therefore, rests upon a transaction which if it had in fact the effect contemplated, namely, of delaying or hindering the creditor, would undoubtedly 'be a transfer void under the Statute of Elizabeth at the instance of the creditor; and in that case the respondent must obviously fail on the principle that a plaintiff cannot recover who is obliged to make out his case through the medium and by the aid of an illegal transaction to which he was himself a party. Taylor v. Chester[10].\nThe respondent, however, has succeeded, the Appellate Division of Alberta being equally divided on the ground that the rule has no application where nothing has been done in execution of the unlawful purpose beyond payment or delivery of the property itself and that in point of fact the creditor whose debt has since been paid was not defeated, hindered or delayed. By the law of Alberta a house and building occupied by an execution debtor and the lot or lots on which they are situate are exempt from execution to the extent of $1,500. The view which has prevailed is that the evidence appearing to shew the property to have been of no greater value than $1,500, at the time the transfer was taken, the transaction could not be a fraudulent one and impeachable as such under the Statute of Elizabeth because of the well settled rule that the statute only aplies to dealings with property which creditors are entitled by law to have applied in the payment of their claims,\nThe judgment of Lord Justice Mellish concurred in by Lord Justice Baggallay in Taylor v. Bowers[11] is relied upon as establishing the proposition that the general principle gives to persons making a payment or delivering goods for an illegal purpose a locus p\u0153nitenti\u00e6 so long as no part of the illegal purpose has been carried out, and that so long as that has not happened the restitution of the property transferred under such an agreement as that disclosed by the evidence in this case can be enforced. Taylor v. Bowers11 was in point of fact not decided upon the principle invoked, Lord Justice James proceeding upon the ground that it was the defendant in that case who was obliged to set up the illegal transaction in order to justify his possession of the goods. Two very eminent judges, however, Lord Jus- tice Mellish and Lord Justice Baggallay do seem to have put their judgment upon the ground that where goods are delivered under a fictitious assignment, the object of which is to defraud creditors, the delivery and assignment of the goods are not to be regarded as execution in part of the illegal purpose so long as no creditor is in fact prejudiced. It has been seriously doubted whether the general principle stated by Lord Justice Mellish in his judgment was correctly applied to the facts of that case; and the subsequent decisions of Kearley v. Thomson[12] and Herman v. Jeuchner[13] afford considerable justification for such doubts. I do not find it necessary for the purpose of deciding this appeal to pass upon the question whether a proper application of the principle stated above to the facts of this case would be to hold that no part of the illegal purpose had been carried out notwithstanding the fact that the conveyance had been taken in the name of the wife. This case must, I think, be approached from a slightly different point of view. The object, as I have said, of taking the transfer in the name of the wife was that her ex facie title should protect the property from pursuit by the husband's creditor, the design being that so long as the debt remained unpaid she should hold the title. Whether or not they had in mind a possible advance in value the scheme necessarily involved the hindering of the creditor in the exercise of his rights in the event of the value of the property reaching a point at which the surplus would become properly exigible. We know that, in 1912, the property had acquired a value of $3,500. It is conceded apparently that some time before the trial the debt was paid; when, does not appear. If any part of the debt was still unpaid after the value of the property rose beyond $1,500 the presumption would be that the creditor was prejudiced. In these circumstances it is impossible to say that the creditor was not prejudiced. Indeed, having regard to the fact that the respondent must have known the precise date when the debt was paid and offered no information about it there is some presumption of fact the other way. The conclusion I have come to, however, is this: Accepting the rule in the form in which it is stated in Symes v. Hughes[14], and Taylor v. Bowers[15] I think the onus in the circumstances of this case was on the respondent to shew that the creditor had not been delayed.\nIt is true that as the respondent in this case does not ask to recover back the property on the ground only that it was property transferred for an illegal purpose which has not been carried out his position is not entirely the same as the position of the plaintiffs referred to in the judgment of Mr. Justice Scott. His case may be put in the alternative. First, the transfer was taken in the name of the appellant, the consideration having been paid, the presumption of advancement is rebutted by the evidence of the agreement between the husband and wife that the property was to be held for the husband for the purpose of protecting him against a creditor. In point of law he rests upon the position that the wife is trustee for him by reason of the fact that the purchase money was paid by him. But while that is his legal position he is obliged, in order to make out that case, to prove an agreement fraudulent in the purpose under which the transfer was taken, which agreement he does not shew that he repudiated before part of its purpose took effect in the delaying of his creditor.\nSecondly. He may allege an express trust arising out of the oral agreement that the property was to be held for him with the object stated. The breach of this express trust, the failure on the part of the wife to carry out the agreement under which she acquired the property being treated in equity as a fraud, constitutes the wife trustee ex maleficio, a trustee, that is to say, who is not entitled to invoke the Statute of Frauds as a protection against her own fraud. Rochefoucauld v. Boustead[16]. The respondent does not (be it observed with reference to an argument of Mr. Ford) in this way of putting his case seek to enforce the express oral trust, although the result in this particular case might be the same in the event of success as if he had succeeded in enforcing the express trust. The respondent's right and remedy would have been precisely the same if the arrangement had been that the wife instead of holding the property in trust for him had bound herself to hold it in trust for a third person, orally; to any proceeding by such third person as cestui que trust for the enforcement of the express oral trust the 7th section of the Statute of Frauds would have been an effectual answer, but there is no answer to an action on the part of the respondent for restitutio in integrum on the ground that the wife's fraudulent refusal to effectuate the express trust under which she acquired the property constitutes her a trustee for the person from whom she received it. Put in this way, nevertheless, the respondent's case still necessarily rests upon an arrangement which when it is fully disclosed appears to be a fraudulent arrangement, and that arrangement the respondent has not shewn to have failed in effectuating its purpose.\nIn the result the appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed.\nANGLIN J. (dissenting).\u2014The plaintiff sues to recover from his wife the proceeds of property admittedly placed in her name with the intent that it should be held by her in order to defeat the claim of one of his creditors. When placed in the name of the defendant the property was occupied by the husband and family and was not worth more than $1,500. It was, therefore, exempt from execution under Sub-section 10 of section 2 of chapter 27 of the \"North-West Territories Consolidated Ordinances, 1898.\"\nIn answer to the plaintiff's claim the defendant sets up:\u2014\n(a) That the purchase money of the property in question was wholly or in great part hers;\n(b) That the property subsequently ceased to be occupied by the plaintiff and became worth more than $1,500 and the surplus would then have been exigible.\n(c) That the plaintiff's admitted fraudulent intent debars his recovery;\n(d) That the plaintiff, in order to succeed, is obliged to establish an express trust which section 7 of the Statute of Frauds renders incapable of proof by parol evidence.\nThe learned trial judge found explicitly that the purchase money all belonged to the plaintiff. He saw the plaintiff in the witness box and believed his story as against that of the defendant whose evidence was taken on commission. This finding was not disturbed on appeal and we are not in a position to say that it is wrong and that the defendant should have been believed rather than the plaintiff.\nIt is the value and condition of the property at the date of the transfer which must determine its exigibility. To hold that a subsequent change in occupation or increase in value should be taken into account would introduce an element quite too speculative, would unsettle titles and would defeat the purpose of the statute. Sims v. Thomas[17]; Willoughby v. Pope[18].\nThe law condemns and penalizes the fraudulent act, not the fraudulent intent. The act must be one which at least may be injurious to persons whom the law protects against it. In Mundell v. Tinkis et al[19] the transfer dealt with was of this character. However wrongful the intent with which it is done, an act in se lawful subjects the person who commits it neither to criminal nor to civil responsibility. The transfer by a debtor of property exempt from seizure is lawful and cannot harm his creditor and, therefore, cannot be fraudulent against him. Mathews v. Feaver[20]; Story's Equity, sec. 367; Rider v. Kidder[21]; Nichols v. Eaton et al[22] at p. 726. However evil the mind and intent of such a debtor may be, he is amenable only in foro conscienti\u00e6. The plaintiff's intent was fraudulent; his act was not. Day v. Day[23], at pp. 167, 166, 172; Symes v. Hughes[24]; Taylor v. Bowers[25]; Cloud v. Meyers et al[26]; Palmer v. Bray et al[27]; 20 Cyc., pages 381-4.\nWere it not for the presumption of an intention to make a gift by way of an advancement, which ordinarily arises where property belonging to a husband is without consideration transferred to or placed in the name of a wife, proof of the absence of consideration would establish a resulting trust in favour of the plaintiff. The presumption of advancement is, however, readily rebuttable, the sole question being the intent with which the transaction took place (Marshal v. Crutwell[28]; In re Young[29], and but for the objection to its admissibility, based on section 7 of the Statute of Frauds, the evidence of the understanding of both husband and wife that the latter should hold as trustee for the former would clearly establish such a trust. That objection cannot prevail, for equity deems it a fraud on the part of a trustee to attempt to withhold trust property from his cestui qui trust for his own benefit, and will not permit the statute to be made the instrument for committing such a fraud. McCormick v. Grogan[30], at p. 97 per Lord Westbury; Rochefoucauld v. Boustead[31]; In re Duke of Marlborough; Davis v. Whitehead[32]; Haigh v. Kaye[33]; Davies v. Otty[34].\nI am for these reasons of the opinion that the appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs. BRODEUR J.\u2014The main point to be decided in this case is whether the property in question having been transferred to the appellant for a fraudulent purpose, the respondent could recover that property.\nThe plaintiff and the defendant are husband and wife.\nThe husband was very heavily indebted. He owned a homestead for which he had agreed to pay a little over $1,000, and which according to the laws of Alberta was exempt from seizure to the extent of $1,500.\nIn order to prevent his creditors from seizing that homestead and in order to defeat them the husband (the plaintiff respondent) had that property conveyed to his wife, the appellant.\nThe husband seeks to recover the property and claims that the wife was holding it as trustee for him.\nIn order to enable him to recover he had to give evidence of the fraudulent scheme; otherwise the wife would have been presumed to have received an advancement. They both admit that the transfer was made for the purpose of defeating creditors. So the presumption of advancement was successfully rebutted provided it involves no other illegality.\nBut the Statute of Frauds is pleaded by the wife who claims that the husband will have to adduce written evidence of the alleged trust.\nThe Statute of Frauds was not made to cover fraud; it does not prevent the proof of a fraud.\nIt is a fraud on the part of a person to whom land is conveyed as trustee to deny the trust and claim the land herself. It is competent to prove by parol evidence that the property was conveyed upon trust for the plaintiff and that the wife is denying the trust and relying upon the form of conveyance in order to keep the land herself. Rochefoucauld v. Boustead[35].\nThe question then is whether the plaintiff can invoke his own fraudulent intent to recover the property from his wife.\nIn general principle fraud vitiates all contracts. The courts never assist a person who has placed his property in the name of another to defraud his creditors, and some decisions go so far as to state that it is of no consequence whether any creditor has been actually defeated or delayed.\nMundell v. Tinkis[36]; Rosenburgher v. Thomas, in 1852,[37]; Kearley v. Thompson, in 1890[38].\nIn the case of a trust the same principle applies and the settlor is prevented from recovering the estate if the trust has been created for a fraudulent purpose. Lewin on Trusts (12 ed.), p. 120.\nBut the trial judge relying on the case of Byrnes v. Hughes[39], says that, where the purpose is not carried into execution, the mere intention to effect an illegal object does not deprive the assignor from recovering the property from the assignee and he says also that it was not necessary, in the present case, for the husband to have the property conveyed to his wife at the time in order to protect the lands in question against his creditors because they were exempt from seizure.\nBy the exemption ordinance, which I have already mentioned, the homestead was exempt from seizure if it did not exceed in value $1,500. We have no positive evidence as to the value of the property at the time it was conveyed to the wife; but we have the evidence that, a short time after, the property was sold for a much larger price. The intent of the husband, then, was to defeat the creditors when the property would become of a value sufficient to become liable to seizure.\nCases of the same kind with regard to homesteads have been decided in the United States. I find a case of Kettleschlager v. Ferrick[40], where it was held that a transfer of the homestead from husband to wife without consideration to prevent creditors from subjecting such premises to the satisfaction of their claims in case the debtor should remove therefrom is fraudulent as to creditors.\nSimilar decisions have been rendered in Texas: Taylor v. Ferguson[41]; Baines v. Baker[42].\nWe have also Barker v. Dayton et al[43], which was decided in the Wisconsin courts.\nThe plaintiff in having the homestead conveyed to his wife never ceased to be the real owner of the property. If the property had remained in his hands it could have been seized by his creditors for the payment of his debts. During all the time his wife was in possession of that property, the creditors, if it was a homestead exceeding in value $1,500, could claim the payment of their debt upon the property.\nThe courts should never help any person who has acted with a fraudulent intent, and the same rule should apply whether a transfer is made for the purpose of defeating subsequent creditors or when it is made with the purpose of defeating existing creditors who may exercise their right upon the increased value of the property.\nFor these reasons I am of opinion that the plaintiff cannot recover the property from his wife and that his action should have been dismissed.\nThe appeal is allowed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\n[1] 8 Alta.

C.P.Q.\u2014\"Lord Campbell's Act\"\u2014Charge to jury\u2014Opinion on questions of fact.\nPer curiam.\u2014Where an order has been made for trial with a jury, according to the provisions of articles 422 et seq of the Code of Civil Procedure of Quebec, and both parties have acquiesced in that form of trial, objection to the right to trial by jury cannot be urged for the first time on an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nAn action for damages, under article 1056 of the Civil Code, brought by dependents of a person whose death was caused in consequence of d\u00e9lit or quasi-d\u00e9lit is an action resulting from personal wrongs within the meaning of articles 421 et seq. of the Code of Civil Procedure of Quebec in which there may be trial by jury. Fitzpatrick C.J. contra.\nPer Fitzpatrick C.J., dissenting.\u2014The right of action given to the dependents, under article 1056 of the Civil Code, is purely statutory, and not a representative right (see Robinson v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co. ((1892) A.C. 481); consequently, the dependents, who have suffered no personal wrongs, are not entitled to trial by jury under the provisions of chapter 21 of the Code of Civil Procedure of Quebec.\nPer Idington, Duff and Anglin JJ.\u2014In his charge to the jury, the judge is entitled to express his opinion on questions of fact if he does so in such a manner as will not lead the jury to think that they are being given a direction which it would be their duty to follow. APPEAL from the judgment of the Superior Court, sitting in review, at Montreal, affirming the judgment entered by Guerin J., upon the verdict of the jury at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe plaintiff brought the action, under article 1056 of the Civil Code, claiming damages on behalf of herself and as tutrix to her minor children, in consequence of the death of her husband, the father of the children, caused, as alleged, by the negligence of the defendants. By the judgment appealed from, on the verdict of the jury, damages were awarded for $3,100 to the widow and $1,000 to the children.\nThe questions in issue on the present appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nRinfret K.C. for the appellants.\nAylmer K.C. and Bissonnet K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice (dissenting).\u2014At first, I was inclined to think that the action might be said to be\nfor the recovery of damages resulting from the personal wrong done to the deceased.\nBut, on further consideration, I have come to the conclusion that the right of action in this case is purely statutory and, if so, the right to trial by jury would not exist.\nThe foundation of the right is article 1056 C.C., which gives an action for the damages occasioned by the death of the injured person to hie consort and his ascendant and descendant relations.\nThe \"Quebec Act,\" 25 Geo. III., eh. 2, the provisions of which are now to be found in article 421 of the Code of Civil Procedure, gives the right to trial by jury only in certain enumerated cases amongst which are\nactions for the recovery of damages resulting from personal wrongs.\nBy article 1056 of the Civil Code, where the person injured by the commission of an offence dies in consequence without having obtained indemnity or satisfaction, his consort has a right to recover from the person who committed the offence all damages occasioned by such death. The pecuniary loss caused by the death\nis at once the basis of the action and the measure of damages.\nThe measure of damages is not the loss or suffering of the deceased, but the injury resulting from his death to the family, so that a jury, in assessing damages, cannot take into consideration the mental sufferings of the plaintiff in respect of bereavement. Blake v. Midland Railway Co. (1852)[1].\nThe Privy Council held in the case of Robinson v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[2], and in subsequent cases, that the right of action given by this article is an independent and personal and not, as under \"Lord Campbell's Act,\" a representative right.\nThis right is a statutory one. No wrong has been done to one of those to whom the right of action is given for which any claim could be advanced were it not for the statute.\nSpeaking of \"Lord Campbell's Act,\" Lord Selbourne said, in Seward v. The \"Vera Cruz\"[3] :\u2014\nThe Act gives a new cause of action, and does not merely remove the operation of the maxim actio personalis moritur cum persona, because the action is given in substance not to the person representing, in point of estate, the deceased man who would naturally represent him as to all his own rights of action which could survive, but to his wife and children, no doubt suing in point of person in the name of his executor. See also per Grive J. in Bradshaw v. Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Co. (1875)[4] ; Leggott v. Great Northern Railway Co. (1876)[5] ; Potter v. Metropolitan District Railway Co. (1874)[6] ; British Columbia Electric Railway Co. v. Gentile[7] ; British Columbia Electric Railway Co. v. Turner[8].\nSuch a statutory claim is not essentially dependent on any wrongdoing by the party made liable in damages. He may not have committed any wrong to the deceased or any wrong at all. As an instance of the latter, I may refer to section 298 of the \"Railway Act,\" R.S.C. 1906, ch. 37.\nThe Privy Council in the case of Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Roy[9], held that the defendant having been guilty of no negligence, was not liable for setting a fire on lands adjoining the railway whilst exercising the rights conferred on it by the legislature.\nSection 298 of the \"Railway Act,\" however, expressly provides that notwithstanding a railway company may have been guilty of no negligence it shall be liable for any damages caused by a fire started by a railway locomotive to the extent of $5,000.\nThe provision in article 421 C.P.Q. does not include such cases of statutory actions and, however suitable we might consider it that such claims should be submitted to a jury, we cannot extend the privilege to a class of cases which is clearly beyond what the statute has authorized.\nThe damages which the deceased might have recovered during his life for the wrong done him, are different from those which his widow is entitled to recover under article 1056 C.C.; Robinson v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co,[10]. The legislature has provided by article 431 C.P.Q. for the assessment of the former by jury, but has made no similar provision for the latter.\nThere certainly has been a certain amount of practice in accordance with the course complained of; but that claims under article 1056 C.C. have frequently been tried with a jury is easily explained, when we remember that, until the decision of the Privy Council in the case of Robinson v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.10, above referred to, it was thought that such actions were of a representative character and that the widow was authorized to sue in derogation of the legal maxim, \"actio personalis moritur cum person\u00e2.\"\nSince the time when the nature of the action was established by the above decisions, it has not hitherto occurred to any one to notice that this difference removed the action out of the class of actions in which article 421 C.P.Q. gives an option of a trial by jury.\nI would allow the appeal with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014I think the objections taken to the learned trial judge's charge, which it is to be observed were not taken at the trial, are untenable.\nThe objection that this is a case not triable by a jury comes rather late in view of the fact that appellants assented to that mode of trial, acquiesced in all that was done in that behalf, and only took the objections for the first time in the appellate court.\nIf there is in law anything in such objections, then in view of all that has transpired, it might well be urged that this is an appeal from a trial in and by a tribunal selected by the parties, and from whose judgment no appeal can lie to this court. See the cases of Attorney-General of Nova Scotia v. Gregory[11]; The Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Fleming[12]; Burgess v. Morton[13]; White v. Dnke of Buccleugh[14]; Craig v. Duffus[15]: Dudgeon and Martin v. Thomson and Patrick (1854)[16] ; Robin et al v. Hoby et al (1856)[17].\nI am afraid the objection is rather late in another sense. The article of the Code as well as preceding legislation in same sense having been so long interpreted as giving the right of trial by jury in the class of cases to which this belongs makes it rather difficult for us now critically to examine the article and declare all that so done was the result of grave error of law. Besides we are asked to apply a mode of interpretation and construction which might have commended itself more readily to the courts of long ago when dealing in over refinements, than to us now.\nThe distinction counsel makes between the right of action a survivor passing through the ordeal of such an accident as in question would have and that given his representatives in case of his death, would have been looked on as very substantial at one time and is to be so yet in the proper application thereof; but, in these times when the point of view has changed so sadly to apply it as a necessary means of interpreting this article 422 C.P.Q. would be going far, and especially so under all the foregoing circumstances.\nIf, however, any one thinks the question worth raising, he should begin at the right stage and not try to do so after such acquiescence as exhibited herein.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014There are two points argued by the appellants: First, that the learned trial judge misdirected the jury in expressing his opinion that the appellants' theory of the accident was not a reasonable one. The learned trial judge was entitled to express his opinion on the point so long as he did not lead the jury to think that he was giving them a direction it would be their duty to follow and it is quite clear that he did not err in this respect.\nSecondly, it is argued that this was not a case for trial by jury under article 421 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Article 1056 of the Civil Code involves a declaration that the dependents entitled to compensation thereunder have an interest in the life of the member of their family standing to them in a relation entitling them to recover under that article. I can see no good reason for saying that this is not an action for damages arising from a personal wrong within the meaning of article 421 C.P.Q. If I had doubts upon the proper construction of article 421 C.P.Q. it would be too late now, I think, in view of the course of interpretation to adopt the construction proposed by the appellants.\nThirdly, an order directing trial by jury was made and the case was tried without objection. The objection comes too late. Pisani v. Attorney-General for Gibraltar[18].\nAnglin J.\u2014The appellant attacks the judgment against it on two grounds;\u2014that there was misdirection by the learned trial judge, and that the right to trial by jury exists only in cases in which it has been specially provided for and that this is not such a case.\nThe alleged misdirection consisted in the expression by the learned trial judge in his charge to the jury of his own opinion upon the evidence on one point in the case. What is complained of the learned trial judge immediately followed by this statement:\u2014\nNow, I want you to remember that so far as any opinion of mine is concerned upon any of the facts I have mentioned, you are not bound to follow my opinion on any question of fact. You will determine those for yourselves, and if you find in the expression of my views anything with which you do not agree on a question of fact, you are not obliged to agree with me, but you can render a decision quite at variance with what I have said with reference to any question of fact. The course taken by the learned judge was, in my opinion, quite within his rights and affords the appellant no ground of complaint.\nBy article 421 C.P.Q. the right to trial by jury is conferred, inter alia,\nin all actions for the recovery of damages, resulting from personal wrongs.\nGiving to the words \"personal wrongs\" the most restricted meaning contended for by Mr. Rinfret, i.e., wrongs causing injury to person or reputation, as distinguished from injury to source of revenue, means of support, property or estate, I think this action is within the purview of article 421.\nThe plaintiff sues under article 1056 C.C. to recover damages occasioned by the death of one Couvrette, who was injured by a fault of the defendant. The damages sought to be recovered resulted from the personal wrong thus done by the defendant to the deceased Couvrette, although the plaintiff does not sue as representative of the deceased or upon the cause of action which he had. That the personal wrong caused to the deceased by an offence or quasi-offence of, or chargeable to, the defendant is the basis of the new cause of action given by article 1056 C.C. for the recovery of the damages resulting from it to the consort and relations is made still more clear by the fact that that right of action exists only if the deceased had not himself obtained satisfaction or indemnity. Had the deceased survived he would have been entitled to recover compensation for any loss of income and diminution in his earning capacity ascribable to the injury which he sustained. That he would have had the right under article 421 C.P.Q. to have his claim for these damages disposed of by a jury the appellants concede, and it seems to me indisputable that they would have resulted from the personal wrong done him. The failure of income and other elements of loss for which article 1056 gives the consort and relations a right to recover damages result just as surely and directly from the personal wrong done to the deceased as would his own loss of income and diminished earning capacity had he survived. They are not the same damages as the deceased would have sustained, and could have sued for. The right of action to recover them does not flow directly and immediately from the injury to the deceased. His death is the condition on which it arises and the statute itself is its source. But while it is the statute which confers the right to recover them, and the death of the deceased is the condition of that right coming into existence and is in one sense the immediate cause of the damages to the consort and family (yet the death is an effect rather than a cause\u2014an effect from which further consequences flow), the damages themselves result from the personal wrong which caused the death entailing them as a consequence neither remote nor indirect. Article 421 C.P.Q. does not prescribe that the wrong resulting in the damages sued for should be to the person of the plaintiff or to the persons of those on whose behalf she sues. It suffices to bring the case within the letter of the article that the damage claimed should have resulted from a personal wrong whether the injury itself was to the person of the plaintiff or to that of another. I find nothing in the spirit of the article or in its history which requires that it should be given an application more restricted than is called for by its literal terms. I. express no opinion upon the question whether in the phrase \"suits for the recovery of damages resulting from personal wrongs,\" now found in article 421 of the C.P.Q. of 1897, which replaced article 348 of the C.C.P. of 1867, which, in turn, was founded on the Consolidated Statutes of Lower Canada of 1860, ch. 83, sec. 26, continuing the right to trial by jury originally conferred by the 25 Geo. III. (L.C.), ch. 2, in the words\nactions grounded * * * in personal wrongs proper to be compensated in damages,\nthe words \"personal wrongs\" are susceptible of a construction which would include the wrong or injury done to the consort and relations by the death of the victim of the defendant's fault.\nHundreds of actions brought under article 1056 C.C. and the earlier legislation (10 & 11 Vict. (Can.), ch. 6; Con. Stat. (Can.)., 1859, tit. 9, ch. 781), have been tried by juries, many of them having been carried on appeal to this court and to the Judicial Committee without any question of the competence of the trial tribunal having been raised. The statutory provision for jury trials thus interpreted and acted upon for many years has been at least three times re-enacted without alteration. Casgrain v. Atlantic and North-West Railway Co.[19], at p. 300. The weight of authority in the few cases in which the question has been raised in the provincial courts, also seems to support the right to have such actions as this submitted to a jury. Steele v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[20]; Robinson v. Montreal Tramways Co.[21]. Moreover, I incline to think that the objection of the defendants, if otherwise good, having been taken for the first time in review and after acquiescence by them in all the proceedings leading up to the submission of the case to a jury, is probably too late.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nBrodeur J.\u2014La princip\u00e2le question qui se pr\u00e9sente dans cette cause est de savoir si une action en dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats institu\u00e9e par la veuve et les enfants de la victime d'un accident peut \u00eatre soumise \u00e0 un proc\u00e8s par jury.\nCette question a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e pour la premi\u00e8re fois devant les tribunaux il y a deux ans et a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 une divergence d'opinions s\u00e9rieuse parmi les juges de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et de la cour d'appel dans les deux causes suivantes: Steele v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[22] ; Robinson v. Montreal Tramways Co.[23].\nLa derni\u00e8re de ces causes est maintenant pendante devant le Conseil Priv\u00e9.\nLe droit d'action de la veuve et des enfants de la victime d'une accident est exerc\u00e9 sous les dispositions de Particle 1056 du Code Civil, au chapitre des d\u00e9lits et quasi-d\u00e9lits et se lit comme suit:\u2014\nDans tous les cas o\u00f9 la partie contre qui le d\u00e9lit o\u00f9 le quasid\u00e9lit a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis d\u00e9c\u00e8de en cons\u00e9quence, sans avoir obtenu indemnit\u00e9 ou satisfaction, son conjoint, ses p\u00e8re, m\u00e8re et enfants ont, pendant l'ann\u00e9e seulement \u00e0 compter du d\u00e9c\u00e8s, droit de poursuivre celui qui en est l'auteur ou ses repr\u00e9sentants pour les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats resultant de tel d\u00e9c\u00e8s.\nL'article du Code de Proc\u00e9dure Civile en vertu duquel la demanderesse a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 un proc\u00e8s par jury est l'article 421, qui se lit comme suit :\u2014\nLe proc\u00e8s par jury petit avoir lieu * * * dans toute poursuite en recouvrement de dommages r\u00e9sultant de torts personnels ou de d\u00e9lits et quasi-d\u00e9lits contre la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 mobili\u00e8re.\nLa demanderesse pr\u00e9tend que sa poursuite a pour objet de recouvrer des dommages \"r\u00e9sultant de torts personnels\" et que par cons\u00e9quent elle a le droit de demander le proc\u00e8s par jury.\nQue veulent dire les mots \"torts personnels\"?\nCette expression a eu sa source dans notre droit statutaire quand on a introduit, en 1785, le proc\u00e8s par jury. Cette loi avait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9e en anglais et la version fran\u00e7aise qui en est publi\u00e9e dans les ordonnances de l'\u00e9poque d\u00e9montre qu'elle n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 qu'une traduction de l'anglais. L'institution du jury, comme on le sait, est une institution anglaise et nous pouvons nous autoriser de tout cela pour rechercher dans les auteurs anglais l'interpr\u00e9tation de ces mots \"torts personnels.\"\nJe trouve que Bigelow, \"On Torts,\" apr\u00e8s avoir, dans son introduction assimil\u00e9 le mot \"wrong\" au mot \"tort,\" nous d\u00e9finit le \"tort\" comme \u00e9tant la violation d'une obligation d\u00e9termin\u00e9e par la loi, breach of duty fixed by law, et il ajoute que \"a tort\" is distinguished from \"a contract\"\nin which the duty to be performed is fixed by the parties themselves in the terms of the agreement.\nPollock, \"On Torts,\" assimile les \"torts\" aux \"civil wrongs.\"\nIl s'ensuit donc que les \"torts\" ou \"civil wrongs\" du droit anglais comprennent les d\u00e9lits et les quasi-d\u00e9lits de la loi civile.\nL'adjectif \"personnels\" ajout\u00e9 au mot \"torts\" donne n\u00e9cessairement une port\u00e9e restreinte \u00e0 ce dernier mot. Les \"torts personnels\" ne couvrent n\u00e9cessairement qu'une partie des d\u00e9lits, c'est-\u00e0-dire les d\u00e9lits, ou torts concernant les personnes. Les d\u00e9lits concernant la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 immobili\u00e8re n'y sont pas compris. Il en est de m\u00eame concernant les d\u00e9lits concernant la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 mobili\u00e8re puisqu'en 1829 la l\u00e9gislature a \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9 d'adopter une loi sp\u00e9ciale pour permettre \u00e0 ces derniers d\u00e9lits, d'\u00eatre soumis \u00e0 un jury. Blackstone, Commentaries, vol. 3, p. 119 dit:\u2014\nAs to injuries which affect the personal security of individuals, they are either injuries against their lives, their limbs, their bodies, their health or their reputation.\nWharton d\u00e9finit les mots \"personal rights\" qui sont l'antith\u00e8se des mots \"personal wrongs\" ou \"torts personnels\" comme suit :\u2014\nThe rights of personal security comprising those of life, limb, body, health, reputation and the right of personal liberty.\nAinsi le meutre, la blessure corporelle, la maladie, le libelle, la diffamation et l'emprisonnement peuvent entrer dans la cat\u00e9gorie de torts personnels.\nComme le disait si bien l'Honorable Juge Mathieu, dans la cause de Chouinard v. Raymond[24] :\u2014\nLes torts ne sont qu'une infraction ou violation des droits. Il s'ensuit que le syst\u00e8me n\u00e9gatif des torts doit correspondre et cadrer avec le syst\u00e8me positif des droits. Comme on divise tous les droits en droits des personnes et droits sur les choses, on doit diviser de m\u00eame g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement les torts en ceux qui affectent les droits des personnes et en ceux qui affectent le droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nQu'avons-nous dans le cas actuel ?\nUn homme a \u00e9t\u00e9 bless\u00e9 par incurie ou n\u00e9gligence. Il est incontestable que de son vivant il aurait eu le droit d'obtenir r\u00e9paration pour ces blessures. On lui avait caus\u00e9 un tort personnel.\nLa loi dit, cependant, que, s'il vient \u00e0 mourir de cet accident, sa femme et ses proches ont un droit d'action contre l'auteur du d\u00e9lit.\nEst ce que ce droit d'action ne r\u00e9sulte pas des torts inflig\u00e9s \u00e0 la personne du d\u00e9funt? Je crois donc que le droit d'action des demandeurs est bas\u00e9 sur ces blessures inflig\u00e9es \u00e0 la personne du d\u00e9funt et tombe sous le coup de l'article 421 du Code de Proc\u00e9dure qui permet aux parties de soumettre leurs pr\u00e9tentions \u00e0 un jury.\nSi nous examinions la jurisprudence, nous voyons que toutes ces actions ont toujour \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9es susceptibles du proc\u00e8s par jury.\nLe point n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9, que je sache, avant la cause de Steele v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[25], que dans une cause, savoir celle de Bouissede v. Hamilton[26], jug\u00e9e en 1898, o\u00f9 le juge Curran a d\u00e9cid\u00e9\nthat an action by a wife for damages resulting from the death of her husband is one for personal wrong and can be tried by jury.\nUne multitude de causes semblables institu\u00e9es par la femme ou les enfants de la victime sous l'article 1056 du Code Civil ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumises \u00e0 des jurys, ont fait l'object de d\u00e9bats judiciaires tr\u00e8s importants devant cette cour et devant la Conseil Priv\u00e9 et on n'a jamais song\u00e9 \u00e0 soulever le droit des parties de les soumettre \u00e0 un jury. Voyez, par exemple, Miller v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.[27], jug\u00e9e par le Conseil Priv\u00e9 en 1906 et qui a pass\u00e9 par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, la Cour de Revision, la cour d'appel et la Cour Supr\u00eame; Robinson v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[28]; Ravary v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.[29], en 1869 ; Curran v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.[30].\nUne autre question qui se pr\u00e9sente dans cette cause est de savoir si la d\u00e9fenderesse appelante peut maintenant pr\u00e9tendre que cette cause n'aurait pas du \u00eatre soumise au jury.\nLa demanderesse avait par son action opt\u00e9 pour un proc\u00e8s par jury suivant les dispositions de Particle 423 du Code de Proc\u00e9dure Civile.\nSi la d\u00e9fenderesse voulait s'objecter \u00e0 cette action, elle aurait du alors le faire et faire rejeter cette option. Non, elle ne conteste pas le droit r\u00e9clam\u00e9 par la demanderesse d'avoir un proc\u00e8s par jury. La contestation est li\u00e9e entre les parties. Plus tard le 18 janvier, 1913, motion est faite sous l'autorit\u00e9 de l'article 424 C.P.Q. pour d\u00e9finir les faits dont le jury doit s'enqu\u00e9rir. Les deux parties, y compris l'appelante, fournissent au juge un m\u00e9moire des faits qu'elles croient n\u00e9cessaire de soumettre \u00e0 l'appr\u00e9ciation du jury. Jugement est rendu sur cette motion et sur ces m\u00e9moires. Il y a donc chose jug\u00e9e sur ce point. Il n'y a jamais eu d'appel ou d'exception au jugement. L'acquiescement qui y est fait par la d\u00e9fenderesse lie cette derni\u00e8re et elle ne peut plus maintenant en appel nous demander de faire mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 un jugement qu'elle a accept\u00e9 et qui a force de chose jug\u00e9e.\nLe proc\u00e8s par jury est un mode d'instruction qui ne touche pas a la comp\u00e9tence ratione materi\u00e6 des tribunaux.\nLa cause soumise \u00e0 un jury est toujours sous le contr\u00f4le du juge de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure. Les tribunaux peuvent \u00eatre un peu g\u00ean\u00e9s dans l'appr\u00e9ciation des faits de la cause \u00e0 cause du verdict; mais ils n'en restent pas moins ma\u00eetres de rejeter le verdict s'il est contraire au poids de la preuve (art. 498). Quant aux questions de droit qui se soul\u00e8vent dans la cause, elles demeurent, qu'il y ait proc\u00e8s par jury ou non, \u00e0 l'enti\u00e8re discr\u00e9tion des juges.\nThomine-Desmazures, au volume 1er, nos, 11, 12 et 13, discute longuement cette question de comp\u00e9tence absolue et comp\u00e9tence relative. Il nous dit qu'une affaire peut donner lieu \u00e0 une poursuite devant diff\u00e9rents tribunaux et cite le cas du cr\u00e9ancier d'une obligation qualifi\u00e9e de lettre de change qui pourrait \u00eatre port\u00e9e devant le tribunal civil parce qu'elle peut \u00eatre regard\u00e9e comme simple promesse de payer. Il n'est pas absolument n\u00e9cessaire qu'elle soit soumise, vu son caract\u00e8re commercial, au tribunal de commerce.\nSi m\u00eame, dit-il, on assigne devant un juge qui ne soit incomp\u00e9tent qu'\u00e0 raison de la qualit\u00e9 des parties ou du domicile du d\u00e9fendeur ou de la situation des biens et que le d\u00e9fendeur ne demande pas \u00e0 \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 devant son juge naturel, l'action aura \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8re.\nAu no. 200, il dit :\u2014\nSi un marchand est traduit pour une affaire de son commerce devant un tribunal civil, l'incomp\u00e9tence n'est pas absolue mais relative parce qu'elle r\u00e9sulte de la qualit\u00e9 de la personne du d\u00e9fendeur.\nEt plus loin, il ajoute, apr\u00e8s avoir cit\u00e9 plusieurs cas d'incomp\u00e9tence:\u2014\nLe d\u00e9fendeur ne sera plus recevable lui-m\u00eame \u00e0 opposer cette pi\u00e8ce d'incomp\u00e9tence s'il a reconnu ou est cens\u00e9 avoir reconnu la jurisdiction devant laquelle il est appel\u00e9.\nJe rel\u00e8ve dans nos rapports judiciaires la cause de Rivers v. Duncan[31], o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9:\u2014 That if a party moved for a jury, he cannot afterwards reject the verdict on the ground that the jury ought not to have been allowed because, he, the mover, was not a merchant or a trader.\nDans la cause actuelle la d\u00e9fenderesse n'a pas elle-m\u00eame demand\u00e9 le proc\u00e8s par jury mais elle n'a pas contest\u00e9 l'option faite par la demanderesse et plus tard elle a particip\u00e9 et acquiesc\u00e9 au jugement qui a d\u00e9fini les faits \u00e0 \u00eatre soumis au jury.\nLes parties ont toujours le droit de soumettre \u00e0 certaines personnes qu'elles d\u00e9signeront (persona designata) les conflits qui s'\u00e9l\u00e8vent entre eux. La proc\u00e9dure dans la pr\u00e9sente cause \u00e9nonce l'intention mutuelle des parties de faire juger leurs diff\u00e9rends par un jury. Il me semble qu'il s'est \u00e9tabli l\u00e0 un contrat judiciaire qu'elles ne sont plus libres de briser. D'autant plus que leur acquiescement a fait l'objet d'un jugement qui a la force de chose jug\u00e9e.\nJe suis donc d'opinion que la d\u00e9fenderesse ne peut pas en appel essayer de se faire relever de cet acquiescement et de ce jugement.\nPour ces raisons, l'appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Perron, Taschereau, Rinfret, Vall\u00e9e & Genest.\nSolicitors for the respondent : Bissonnet & Cordeau.\n[1] 18 Q.B. 93.\n[2] [1892] A.C. 481.\n[3] 10 App. Cas. 59.\n[4] L.B. 10 C.P. 189.\n[5] 1 Q.B.D. 599.\n[6] 30 L.T. 765.\n[7] 30 Times L.E. 594.\n[8] 49 Can.

LaRoche (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nMary Ann LaRoche and Others (Defendants) Respondent.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Idington, Duff, Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\n1915: November 16, 17; 1916: February 1.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.\nQuebec marriage laws\u2014Community of property\u2014Dissolution by death\u2014Failure to make inventory\u2014Insolvent estate\u2014Continuation of community\u2014Estoppel\u2014Renunciation.\nWhere the matrimonial community was in insolvent circumstances at the time of the wife's death, in 1877, the failure of the husband to make an inventory of the common property did not have the effect of causing continuation of community under the provisions of articles 1323 et seq. of the Civil Code as then in force. King v. McHendry (30 Can. S.C.R. 450) followed. Fitzpatrick C.J. and Duff J. dissented.\nThe judgment appealed from (Q.R. 24 K.B. 138) was affirmed.\nPer Duff J. (dissenting).\u2014The failure of the husband to cause an inventory to be made within three months after the death of the wife had the effet of concluding him finally, as against the minor children, from asserting that continuation of community did not take place; the heirs, claiming through him, are in the same position. As the right to the benefit of continuation of community is not a personal right, but is one given to the minor children in substitution of their right to an account, as at the expiration of the time for making an inventory, it is a claim that may be made at any time unless it could be said that the failure to make the demand during the lifetime of the surviving consort operated as a renunciation.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side[1], reversing the judgment of Dorion J., in the Superior Court, District of Quebec, and dismissing the plaintiff's action with costs.\nCommunity as to property existed between the plaintiff's father and mother, who were married in 1872, and were residents of the City of Quebec. The plaintiff's mother died intestate, in 1877, leaving, her surviving, her husband and the plaintiff and his sister, children, issue of the marriage. At the time of the death of his wife, the husband's estate (which consisted of a drug business, in Quebec) was insolvent and he did not make an inventory under the provisions of the Civil Code, articles 1323 et seq., as then in force, relating to \"Continuation of Community.\" In 1883, the plaintiff's father contracted a second marriage, of which seven children were born and were still living at the time of his death, in 1912. He died intestate and was survived by the second wife, who was separate as to property under their marriage contract. The plaintiff, appellant, brought the action against his sister, his stepmother and the children of the second marriage, contending that there had been continuation of community of the first marriage and claiming, for himself and his sister, their proportionate share in the estate as it existed at the time of the death of his father. His action was maintained in the Superior Court, but the judgment of that court was reversed by the judgment now appealed from.\nSt. Laurent K.C. for the appellant,\nG. Gr. Stuart K.C. for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice (dissenting).\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed for the reasons given by the trial judge and by Mr. Justice Carroll in the Court of King's Bench.\nIdington J.\u2014Though entertaining much doubt as to the correctness of the inference of fact upon which the judgment of the court below rests, I cannot see my way to reversing the same.\nDuff J. (dissenting).\u2014The better view seems to be, on principle, that the failure of the husband to make an inventory within three months after the death of the wife has the effect of concluding him finally as against the minor children from saying whether the community was dissolved by the death of the wife. It is for the minor children to say whether they shall or shall not take advantage in this way of the default and until something has been done by them which precludes them from doing so they do not lose this right. It is difficult to say why the death of the father should deprive them of the right. The heirs claim through the father and I cannot understand why, in principle, their position as against his minor children should be any better than his position at the moment of his death.\nThe respondent's construction leads to inconveniences and I have been unable to find any satisfactory ground upon which such rule can properly be rested.\nIt might throw some light upon the question to know whether the community is dissolved by the death of the infant heir leaving an heir. As the right is not a right personal to the infant heir and as it is given in substitution of the right to demand an account as at the expiration of the time for making an inventory, it should seem on ordinary principles that it is a demand that could be made at any time unless it could be said that the failure to make it during the lifetime of the survivor operates as a renunciation.\nPothiers' treatment of the subject seems to be opposed to the respondent's hypothesis.\nSee also Lamignon at pages 288 and 289 :\u2014\nLe m\u00eame article 241 ajoute, qu'\u00e0 faute de faire clore l'inventaire dans les trois mois, la communaut\u00e9 est dissolue, si bon semble aux enfants: et quelques-uns ont pens\u00e9 que ce qui \u00e9tait \u00e0 la fin de cet article ne signifie autre chose, sinon que la continuation de communaut\u00e9 n'est point necessaire de la part des enfants, et qu'il est en leur libert\u00e9 d'y renoncer; et que, quand ils demandent la continuation de communaut\u00e9, ils sont oblig\u00e9s d'en souffrir le cours pour l'avenir, nonobstant l'inventaire qui n'a point \u00e9t\u00e9 clos dans les trois mois, puisque, par le d\u00e9faut de cloture, il se trouve nul et d\u00e9fectueux, et est d\u00e9clare tel par la coutume.\nMais il semble que l'intention et l'esprit de la coutume a \u00e9t\u00e9 de faire une d\u00e9cision contraire; car il \u00e9tait inutile de r\u00e9p\u00e9ter, en cet article, que les enfants ont la facult\u00e9 de prendre la communaut\u00e9 du temps du mariage, dans l'\u00e9tat qu'elle \u00e9tait lors de la dissolution du mariage, ou bien de demander la continuation de communaut\u00e9. Cela avait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9, en termes formels et pr\u00e9cis, par le pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent article. Mais, dans celui-ci la coutume ayant d\u00e9cid\u00e9, premi\u00e8rement, que la communaut\u00e9 est dissolue du jour que l'inventaire est fait et parfait, \u00e0 la charge de le faire clore dans trois mois: et, en second lieu, qu'a faute de faire la, dite cloture dans le temps prescrit, la communaut\u00e9 est continu\u00e9e, et reprend son cours ordinaire; elle a apport\u00e9 \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re d\u00e9cision un temperament, si bon semble aux enfants; c'est-a-dire, que la d\u00e9faut de cloture, dans trois mois, rend la continuation de communaut\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire contre le survivant des p\u00e8re et m\u00e8re, qui pouvait et devait faire clore l'inventaire pour satisfaire \u00e0 la coutume. Mais, \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des enfants, elle a laiss\u00e9 \u00e0 leur libert\u00e9 de se servir du d\u00e9faut de cette formalit\u00e9 pour faire courir la communaut\u00e9; ou bien de l'arr\u00e8ter du jour de l'inventaire, quoiqu'il ne soit pas clos; parceque cette cloture et cette affirmation judiciaire de l'inventaire ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 ordonn\u00e9e en faveur des enfants, il leur est loisible de renoncer \u00e0 ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli en leur faveur, et \u00e0 une solemnit\u00e9 extrinseque qui n'est ni du corps ni de la substance de l'inventaire, attendu m\u00eame que, par le texte de l'article, l'inventaire \u00e9tait parfait et capable de dissoudre la communaut\u00e9 avant la cl\u00f4ture. Had the representatives from Quebec in this court been unanimous I should not have ventured to differ from the view of the court below.\nIn the existing circumstances, however, with great diffidence, I am constrained to say that in my opinion the appellant ought to succeed.\nAnglin J.\u2014In King v. HcHendry[2], Mr. Justice Girouard speaking for his colleagues says, at page 456, that, in order that there should be continuation of community between a surviving spouse and the children of the marriage,\nil faut donc qu'il ait des biens communs et c'est aux parties qui invoquent la continuation de communaut\u00e9 \u00e5 all\u00e9guer et prouver ce fait.\nThe learned judge adds that the maxim, de minimis non curat lex, applies and that the possession of trifling articles of absolute necessity and exempt from seizure does not impose the obligation of inventory. This was the basis of the judgment of this court, reversing that of the Court of King's Bench.\nThis precedent binds us.\nIn the formal judgment of the Court of King's Bench in the present case we find this \"consid\u00e9rant\":\nConsidering that it appears from the record that at the time of his first wife's death, respondent's father and the community of property that existed between his father and mother were insolvent.\nMr. Justice Trenholme, speaking for the majority of the court, says :\u2014\nThe community was, beyond doubt, insolvent. * * * The evidence and documents filed shew that the insolvency extended back to the first wife's death. Speaking for the dissenting minority, Mr. Justice Carroll says:\u2014\nLa preuve indique que la solvabilit\u00e9 de W. H. Laroche \u00e0 la mort de sa premi\u00e8re femme, \u00e9tait bien probl\u00e9matique.\nIt is, therefore, evident that the appellant failed to prove the existence at the time of his mother's death of such property of the community as would, under the authority of King v. McHendry[3], subject his father to the obligation of inventory.\nWhile by no means satisfied that if free from the constraint of authority I should not have reached the same conclusion as the learned trial judge, in deference to the previous decision of this court I concur in the dismissal of this appeal.\nBrodeur J.\u2014Il s'agit dans cette cause de savoir s'il y a eu continuation de communaut\u00e9.\nLors du d\u00e9c\u00e8s de la femme, qui est arriv\u00e9 en 1877, les biens de la communaut\u00e9 qui avait exist\u00e9 entre elle et son mari \u00e9taient peu consid\u00e9rables, et il para\u00eet \u00e9vident que le passif exc\u00e9dait l'actif. A tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, deux ou trois ans plus tard, le mari, qui faisait affaires comme pharmacien, a \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9 de faire cession de ses biens suivant les dispositions de l'acte de faillite de 1875.\nIl n'avait pas jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de faire inventaire, \u00e9videmment \u00e0 raison du fait que les frais d'inventaire et de partage auraient occasionn\u00e9 des d\u00e9penses qui, auraient augment\u00e9 davantage le passif de la communaut\u00e9; et alors il a cru qu'il valait mieux continuer les affaires. Il comptait sur des jours meilleurs o\u00f9 il pourrait am\u00e9liorer la situation financi\u00e8re de la communaut\u00e9. Malheureusement ce commerce ne fut point prosp\u00e8re et il fut oblig\u00e9 de faire cession de ses biens. Il y eut liquidation de tous les biens, m\u00eame ceux de la communaut\u00e9, et le mari est rest\u00e9 avec des dettes.\nLe mari a fait affaire ensuite sous le nom d'un fr\u00e8re qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9 encore cependant de faire cession de ses biens vers 1885. Il a continu\u00e9 encore \u00e0 faire affaire comme pharmacien sous la raison sociale de Laroche & Compagnie et en d\u00e9finitive, \u00e0 sa mort, il avait r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 amasser une fortune assez consid\u00e9rable.\nLe demandeur est devenu majeur il y a \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s quinze ans et pendant la vie de son p\u00e8re il n'a jamais song\u00e9 \u00e0 demander la continuation de la communaut\u00e9.\nJe vois que la Cour d'Appel a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il n'y avait pas eu continuation de communaut\u00e9 parce que l'absence d'inventaire n'avait caus\u00e9 aucun pr\u00e9judice au demandeur.\nCette question \u00e9tait venue devant cette cour il y a quelques ann\u00e9es dans une cause de King v. McHendry[4], et il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 dans cette cause qu'il n'y avait pas eu n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de faire inventaire parce que les biens \u00e9taient d'une valeur insignifiante et que dans ce cas il n'y avait pas lieu \u00e0 la continuation de communaut\u00e9.\nEn appliquant les principes de cette d\u00e9cision \u00e0 la cause actuelle, je consid\u00e8re que le demandeur n'est pas en droit de faire d\u00e9clarer qu'il y a eu continuation de communaut\u00e9 parce que s'il n'y a pas eu d'inventaire cela ne lui a occasionn\u00e9 aucun pr\u00e9judice. Il me para\u00eet \u00e9vident que la communaut\u00e9 \u00e9tait insolvable \u00e0 la mort de l\u00e0 femme. Le p\u00e8re, cependant, a jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de continuer \u00e0 tenir pharmacie dans l'espoir qu'il r\u00e9ussirait \u00e0 sortir des difficult\u00e9s financi\u00e8res o\u00f9 il se trouvait. Malheureusement le succ\u00e8s ne vint pas couronner ses efforts : il fut oblig\u00e9 de faire cession de ses biens et l\u00e0 un inventaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait, qui n'est pas, il est vrai, l'inventaire notari\u00e9 requis par la loi mais il y a eu liquidation des biens de la communaut\u00e9 et le droit demander alors l'inventaire est disparu, puisqu'il n'y avait plus rien \u00e0 inventorier.\nPour ces raisons, le jugement de la Cour d'Appel qui a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il n'y avait pas eu continuation de communaut\u00e9 doit \u00eatre confirm\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Galipeault, St. Laurent, Metayer & Lafert\u00e9.\nSolicitors for the respondents : Pentland, Stuart, Gravel & Thomson.\n[1] Q.R. 24 K.B. 138.\n[2] 30 Can.

Kerr (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1915: November 30; 1916: February 1.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Idington, Duff, Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.\nPartnership\u2014Shares in business\u2014Associating third person\u2014Goodwill\u2014Accounting between partners\u2014Art. 1853 C.C.\nFor a number of years the defendants had carried on, in partnership, the business of accountants and, as their operations expanded, they engaged assistants, who were called \"junior partners,\" remunerating them by salaries and percentage rates on yearly profits and, in some years, with bonus additions. With the approval of the \"junior partners,\" the defendants associated P. in a one-fourth share of the business and the firm name was changed for the new organization which was carried on according to terms mentioned in an agreement which recited that it had been agreed between the defendants \"that those at present constituting the firm\" and \"those for the time being constituting the firm of W. B. P. & Co.\" should arrange a partnership, etc. Upon making this arrangement the defendants received \u00a320,000 from P. and, some time afterwards, in similar circumstances, \u00a31,000 was received by them from G. The defendants retained these sums, as their own, and did not inform the \"junior partners\" that they had been paid. In an action by a \"junior partner\" for an account and a proportionate share of this \u00a321,000:\u2014\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from (Q.R. 24 K.B. 321), that the moneys so received by the defendants were not paid for a share in the business to be taken wholly from their individual interests therein, but for a share in the assets and goodwill of the business itself; consequently, the plaintiff had an interest in the moneys so paid and was entitled to an account and a proportionate share thereof.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side[1], affirming the judgment of Panneton J., in the Superior Court, District of Montreal, maintaining the plaintiff's action with costs.\nThe circumstances of the case are stated in the judgments now reported.\nR. C. Smith E.C. and F. H. Markey K.C for the appellants.\nGordon MacDougall K.C. and Adrian K. Hugesson for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I can find no grounds for holding that the large sums paid to the defendants Marwick and Mitchell on what was practically the admission of fresh partners to the firm of Marwick, Mitchell & Co., of which they were the senior partners, were moneys to which they were entitled to the exclusion of the other partners in the firm. The presumption, it seems to rue, is that these moneys were paid for an interest in the business and not in so much of the business as would be represented by the proportion of the interests of these two partners, large though that was. Indeed, I think, it was this largeness of their interest that must have led these two partners into the mistaken belief that the business was really their own and that they could make such dispositions as they pleased without being accountable to the junior partners in the concern.\nThe unfortunate secrecy which the two defendants preserved as to the moneys received by them prevented any possible acquiescence of the other partners in the arrangements made.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed.\nIdington J.\u2014The respondent sued appellants for an account of moneys received by them under circumstances which it is claimed rendered the moneys so received the property of the partnership of which they were all members.\nThe courts below have maintained a judgment for 16,950.73 in default of the accounting claimed.\nThe appellants carried on business at New York as chartered accountants, and prospered therein so much that they needed numerous assistants. Some of these assistants were encouraged to be zealous in their work by being called partners in the business and receiving a percentage of the profits and occasionally a handsome bonus in prosperous years.\nIn this way many were induced to join them not only in New York, but in many other places. The respondent acted in Montreal, for example, as a member of the firm. Yet it is said there never was, until the events I am about to refer to, any written agreement evidencing the terms of what constituted the partnership.\nConsidering the magnitude of the business, this single fact is a tribute to the trustworthy character of the mode in which they dealt with each other and also a significant measure of the trust reposed in the appellants by those they thus came in contact with.\nThis state of things with increasing prosperity continued until August, 1911.\nBut for the single fact that all concerned seemed agreed to call this arrangement a partnership and, throughout the transactions we have to consider, did so in a manner that renders it impossible herein to hold the business otherwise than as one of a partnership, I should have been disposed to hold that there never was, in fact, a partnership between the appellants and the respondent and those others like him allied with them.\nIt was quite competent for the appellants to have carried on their business in the firm name they adopted and, as between themselves and junior partners, to have engaged such juniors on salary, or salary plus a percentage of the profits, and even to have added thereto encouraging grants by way of bonuses and yet not to have given rise to the claim that in law there was any partnership or any right to any such accounting as claimed herein.\nThe business originally was that of appellants and they may have felt it always remained so.\nIndeed, but for the terms of the documentary evidence I am about to refer to, it might have been arguable that it had continued as a business owned by appellants up to and including the months of August, September and early part of October, which, in point of time, cover the events that must determine the right of the parties herein.\nHad the business at the time first mentioned and in question been that of appellants it would have been quite competent for them to have sold out an interest therein to a third person.\nThat, however, is not the case.\nIn August, 1911, the appellants contracted with W. B. Peat & Co. by a written agreement, not on their own behalf, but on behalf of themselves and those then constituting the firm of Marwick, Mitchell & Co. to arrange a partnership on the terms mentioned therein. One of these was that\nW. B. Peat & Co. acquire one-fourth interest in the business and goodwill of Marwick, Mitchell & Co.\nAnother was that the firm should thereafter be known as that of Marwick, Mitchell, Peat & Co., and yet another that W. B. Peat & Co. were to find one-fourth of the capital of Marwick, Mitchell, Peat & Co., which was to be $250,000, of which W. B. Peat & Co. were to provide $62,500.\nIt transpired that the appellants received from W. B. Peat & Co. \u00a320,000 as the price paid for such share of the goodwill in said business over and above the said sum of $62,500 contributed by W. B. Peat & Co. It is pretended that this sum, clandestinely paid appellants, was in respect of this share in the firm of Marwick, Mitchell & Co.\nThe conclusive answer to such contention is contained in the first clause of this memorandum of agreement, which reads as follows:\u2014\nIt is agreed between James Marwick and Simpson Roger Mitchell that those at present constituting the firm of Marwick, Mitchell & Co. on the one part and those for the time being constituting the firm of W. B. Peat & Co. on the other part to arrange a partnership on the following terms.\nIt is impossible properly to hold that such an express agreement can be cut down by anything Mr. Marwick may have said so as to read as if he and Mitchell were only dealing with and selling their own interest in the business.\nIt as very suggestive also that the price of the sale is not mentioned in the memorandum and that every clause thereof proceeds upon the basis of a dealing for and in respect of the entire business and its continuation for a period of ten years and with the contemplated extension thereof elsewhere, as well as in the United States and Canada where it had been previously carried on and was to be continued.\nThe agreement, so drawn up as to conceal the fact of appellants being paid anything, was submitted by the appellants to their partners, including the respondent, and made the basis upon which was framed, in October, articles of partnership between all the old partners and the new.\nIt is urged on behalf of the appellants that this new partnership agreement so modified the terms of the partnership that had hitherto prevailed as to give respondent and some of the junior partners an increased share in the profits, and diminished correspondingly the shares of appellants in the profits.\nAnd it is further urged, with his usual force and ability, by counsel for appellants, that the new partnership agreement shews that this feature of it had, in effect if not in express terms, provided for the taking, of the quarter interest of the whole which Peat & Co. were to get, out of the seventy-five per cent. share of the profits which previously appellants had enjoyed.\nThe argument is, however, on examination of the facts, more plausible than sound.\nExperience teaches us that the junior partners, if men of merit, generally deserve and get as the years go on an increasing share of the profits and especially so in the cases of this kind where the prosperity of the business must depend almost entirely upon the mental and moral qualities and energy of the members of the firm, and is not much dependent upon the financial capital they possess.\nIn partnerships of the kind where the accumulations of capital held by the senior or other members are of necessity the dominant power or force in relation to which the division of profits is likely to take place the feature of experience I have just alluded to may not be so much in evidence.\nEven there, however, the lessening vitality or deterioration of the older men, and growing power and influence of the younger men, often accounts for the changes found in the relative share of profits.\nAgain, this new term of partnership was to last for ten years and some of the elements that had entered into the division of profits enuring to the juniors were cut out.\nIt is impossible for us to say what the respondent and others might have done had they been dealt with frankly.\nThe respondent, and others in their position, were in law, and according to the principles of fidelity that must ever obtain between partners, entitled to a full disclosure of the bargain appellants made ostensibly on behalf of all the members of the old firm, and to share in the profits thereof.\nThere was another transaction of a similar nature in respect of which we did not hear much in argument, but which seems to require the same sort of relief for respondent as is applied by the judgment to both causes of action.\nSome argument was made as to the basis upon which the sum named in the judgment was founded.\nIt seems this sum is only a maximum sum liable to be reduced upon a taking of accounts with which we have at present no concern. I think, therefore, we should not express any opinion at the present time in regard thereto.\nThe case as presented is not ripe for any such expression of opinion.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014The appellants' contention is that the moneys received from Peat were received in payment of the purchase price of the fraction of their own interest in the partnership business, moneys consequently for which they would not be accountable to their partners, and the real question of substance on the appeal is whether, on the evidence before us, the proper conclusion is that the appellants are entitled, as against the respondent, to say that the arrangement between themselves and Peat was that Peat should purchase from them a share of their interest and that Peat, in fact, entered the firm and became a partner as the holder of the share so purchased and that no part of the interests of any of the junior partners contributed to make up the interest acquired by Peat. I have come to a conclusion which is adverse to the appellants upon this question. My reason is this. The arrangement between the appellants and Peat was followed by the execution of the document which, on the face of it, professed to be a record of an agreement between Marwick, Mitchell & Co. and Peat & Co. for a partnership. The document declares among other things that Peat & Co. acquire a one-fourth share in the business of Marwick, Mitchell & Co. The agreement was necessarily provisional in this sense, that it was a transaction of a kind in respect of which Marwick and Mitchell would have no authority to bind the other members of their firm and before becoming legally effectual it required legal ratification by these other members. This document was, however, placed before the other members of the firm shortly after its execution and a fresh arrangement was made among the partners of Marwick, Mitchell & Co. embodied in the document, dated the 1st of October, in which the residue of the business, after allowing for the one-quarter interest acquired by Peat & Co. was dealt with, and the shares of the various partners in that residue declared.\nNow, I do not think anybody would dispute\u2014I did not understand Mr. Smith to dispute it\u2014and, indeed, I think it would be hopeless to do so, that, on the natural reading of these documents, they provide, first, that Peat & Co. acquire a one-fourth interest in the business of Marwick, Mitchell & Co., not from Marwick and Mitchell but from the firm, and that the residue the remaining seventy-five per cent., is held by the partners of the old firm of Marwick, Mitchell & Co., in the proportion stated. In other words, the agreement which Marwick and Mitchell professed to make with Peat on behalf of the firm is ratified by the firm by the transaction entered into on their behalf and that transaction, so ratified, is by the instruments in fact declared to be a vesting in Peat & Co. of a one-fourth interest in the business of Marwick, Mitchell & Co.\nIt seems to me that as the new agreement, embodied in the document of October, was an agreement made on the footing of the transaction with Peat being such as I have described, that transaction must be conclusively taken, as between the parties to this litigation, to have been of that character. It does not appear to me to be necessary to resort to the doctrine of common law lawyers known by the name of estoppel. In fact, by the document of August, Peat did acquire from the partnership a one-fourth interest in the partnership business subject to ratification by the partners. The transaction ratified by them was the transaction embodied in the document and it seems to be hopeless now to suggest that, apart from that transaction, there was another and a different transaction by which Peat acquired a one-fourth interest not from the firm but from Marwick and Mitchell.\nAnglin J.\u2014The sole question in this case, at its present stage, is whether it should be held that the one-fourth interest which Peat & Co. acquired in the business of Marwick, Mitchell &. Co. was taken wholly from the individual interests in that firm of Messrs. Mitchell and Marwick, as they contend, or was contributed to by all the partners in the firm of Marwick, Mitchell & Co. as the plaintiff maintains. I say \"it should be held\" advisedly, because owing to the secretive conduct of the defendants\u2014admittedly a mistake if nothing worse\u2014it is now extremely difficult, if not impossible, to learn with certainty the fact itself. For that the defendants are to blame and they have themselves to thank for having created a situation in which all presumptions must be made against them. The learned trial judge held that the proper conclusion from all the evidence was that the purchase of Peat & Co. was in fact from the firm and not from Messrs. Marwick & Mitchell as individual members of it. The documents submitted to and accepted by the plaintiff and the other junior partners as containing the basis upon which Peat & Co. entered into the new partnership and on which they themselves assented to the redistribution of shares then made certainly give the impression that it was a share in the business of the firm, its assets and goodwill, and not in Messrs. Marwick and Mitchell's individual interests therein that Messrs Marwick & Mitchell had agreed that Peat & Co. should acquire, and that it was from the firm, that is, from all the partners, that they should acquire that share. It is impossible now to say that the junior partners would have accepted the new partnership arrangement on any other basis.\nThe fact that under the new arrangement the proportionate share of the junior partners in the profits was increased and that of Messrs Marwick and Mitchell was decreased by an amount sufficient to cover the interest acquired by Peat & Co. might, at first blush, be taken to shew that Messrs. Marwick and Mitchell were the sole contributors to the 25% assigned to Peat & Co. But any such inference is unwarranted. It is impossible now to say what would have been the future interest of the junior partners in the firm had Peat & Co. not been taken in. It is equally impossible to say what would have been the attitude of the junior partners to the proposal actualy carried out had they been made aware of the payment of \u00a320,000 by Peat & Co. to Messrs Marwick and Mitchell. Under these circumstances, notwithstanding the explicit evidence of Mr. Marwick as to the true nature of the consideration for which he received the \u00a320,000 from Peat & Co. (which may be strictly true) I am not prepared to hold that the conclusion reached by the provincial courts, that that sum should now be regarded as money received by Messrs. Marwick and Mitchell for a share of a business, assets and goodwill in which the plaintiff and the other junior partners were interested, is erroneous. The same considerations apply to the payment of \u00a31,000 made by Percy Garratt.\nAll questions as to what should be the quantum of the plaintiff's recovery remain open upon the accounting directed by the judgment appealed from. It is only in default of such accounting by the defendants that the sum claimed by the plaintiff has been awarded to him. The order for an accounting fully protects the defendants and they are not, in my opinion, entitled to have the court now enter upon the accounting which would be the only method of ascertaining whether the sum claimed by the plaintiff is or is not too large.\nI would, for these reasons, dismiss this appeal.\nBrodeur J.\u2014The appellants, the respondent and the mis en cause were carrying on business in co-partnership as accountants in Canada and the United States. The appellants, Marwick and Mitchell, had started that business several years ago and acquired a large client\u00e8le. The respondent was at first in their employ, but he was given, in 1905, outside of his salary an interest in the business to the extent of two and one-half per cent. on the profits.\nIn the summer of 1911, the profits of that business were then divided on the basis of 77\u00bd% to Marwick and Mitchell, the senior partners, and 22\u00bd% to their former employees and now called junior partners. As may be very easily understood, the affairs of the partnership were carried on under the management and control of the senior partners.\nOn going over to England, in the summer of 1911, Mr. Marwick met Sir William Peat, the head of the firm of W. P. Peat & Co., who were carrying on, in England, in the United States and in Canada, a similar and competitive business of chartered accountants.\nThey agreed to amalgamate their American business and a new partnership was to be formed comprising all the members of the two firms of Marwick, Mitchell & Co. and of W. B. Peat & Co.\nThe goodwill of Marwick, Mitchell & Co. was evidently more extensive since W. B. Peat & Co. agreed to pay, outside of their mise de fonds, a sum of \u00a320,000. That sum of money was handed over to Marwick and Mitchell, the appellants. They failed to disclose that payment to their junior partners and now the respondent claims a share of that sum, and also of a sum of \u00a31,000 that was paid by a junior partner, by the name of Percy Garratt, under almost similar circumstances.\nThe appellants plead that that money was given to them as a consideration for a part of the individual interest owned by Marwick and Mitchell.\nThe written evidence, however, and the new contract of partnership disclose on the contrary that what was acquired by W. B. Peat & Co. was\none-fourth interest in the business and goodwill of Marwick, Mitchell & Co.\nIt is admitted by the appellants that Kerr, the respondent, was a member of the firm of Marwick, Mitchell & Co.\nAs such he was entitled to his share in the goodwill of that firm.\nThe appellants having disposed of a part of that goodwill for a sum of \u00a321,000 they were bound not only to disclose that agreement to their co-partners, but to account to them for their share in that sum.\nThe action en reddition de compte is well founded and the judgment a quo having maintained it should be confirmed.\nThe appellants are ordered to render an account within a certain time and in default of doing it they are condemned to pay the respondent the sum of 16,980.73.\nThe latter figure is evidently based upon a calculation made by the respondent of his share in the business of Marwick, Mitchell & Co.\nI have not considered at all the question whether this calculation is correct. That matter will have to be disposed of on the account itself when it is rendered.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Smithy Market, Skinner, Pugsley & Hyde.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Lafleur, MacDougall, Macfarlane & Pope.\n[1] Q.R. 24 K.B. 321.\n",

(Duff and Anglin JJ. contra).\u2014The appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada given by section 106 of the \"Winding-Up Act,\" R.S.C., 1906, ch. 144, must be br ought within sixty days from the date of the judgment appealed from, as provided by section 69 of the \"Supreme Court Act,\" R.S.C., 1906, ch. 139. After the expiration of the sixty days so limited neither the Supreme Court of Canada nor a judge thereof can grant leave to appeal. Goodison Thresher Co. v. Township of McNab (42 Can. S.C.R. 694), and Hillman v. Imperial Elevator and Lumber Co. (53 Can. S.C.R. 15), followed; Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Department of Agriculture of Ontario (42 Can. S.C.R. 557), distinguished.\nPer Duff J. (dissenting).\u2014Under section 106 of the \"Winding-up Act,\" the application for leave to appeal may be made after the expiration of sixty days from the date of the judgment from which the appeal is sought and, whether it be made before or after the expiration of the sixty days, lapse of time should be considered by the judge applied to and acted on by him in the exercise of discretion, according to the circumstances of the case. Per Anglin J. (dissenting).\u2014On such an application for leave to appeal, the provisions of section 71 of the \"Supreme Court Act\" apply and an extension of the time for appealing may be obtained thereunder.\nPer Idington J.\u2014There is no authority under which an application for an order affirming the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Canada to entertain an appeal can be made to the court; the proper and only course is by application to the registrar acting as judge in chambers. Per Duff J.\u2014Although not strictly the proper procedure, the objection to such an application may be waived.\nPer Duff J.\u2014Section 106 of the \"Winding-Up Act\" imposes a further condition of the right of appeal over and above those imposed by sections 69 and 71 of the \"Supreme Court Act\"; an applicant, having obtained leave after the expiration of the time limited for appealing, is still obliged to satisfy a judge of the court appealed from that special circumstances justify an extension of time, and it is the duty of that judge to exercise proper discretion in making such an order on his own responsibility. Attorney-General v. Emerson (24 Q.B.D. 56), and Banner v. Johnston (L.R. 5 H.L. 157), referred to.\nPer Brodeur J.\u2014In the case of appeals from judgments rendered under the \"Winding-Up Act\" the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Canada is determined by section 106 of the \"Winding-Up Act\" and is dependent solely upon the amount involved in the judgment appealed from and not upon the amount demanded in the proceedings on which that judgment was rendered.\nMOTION for an order affirming the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Canada to entertain an appeal from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, varying the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal, in favour of the claimants, by reducing the total amount awarded them to $144,094.\nIn the course of proceedings taken under the \"Winding-up Act,\" K.S.C., 1906, ch. 144, for the liquidation of the Great Northern Construction Company, the respondents filed a claim for $149,721.93, which they alleged to be owing to them by the company, for $33,000 of the company's bonds and also for a large amount of common and debenture stock of the company. The appellant, being the holder of twenty shares in the company, contested this claim and contended that the claimants were not entitled to any amount whatever nor to rank as creditors. By the judgment of the Superior Court the claimants were awarded, for principal and interest on the first item of their claim, the sum of #102,217 and, in addition, $33,000 for their claim on the bonds, forming together a condemnation for #155,017. On an appeal to the Court of King's Bench, by judgment rendered on the 2nd November, 1915, this judgment was affirmed in respect of the first item and the judgment in regard to the bonds was varied, thus reducing the whole condemnation to #144,094.\nOn 10th January, 1916, the claimant applied, under the provisions of the 106th section of the \"Winding-Up Act,\" to Mr. Justice Anglin, \u00e1 judge of the Supreme Court of Canada, in Chambers, for an order granting leave to appeal from the judgment so rendered by the Court of King's Bench, and, on that application, leave to appeal was granted on terms that the usual security for costs should be given within ten days and a motion to affirm the jurisdiction to entertain the appeal brought on for hearing at the then next session of the Supreme Court of Canada. The reasons for the order so made were as follows:\u2014\nAnglin J. (in Chambers).\u2014The contestant, Boss, applies for leave to appeal from a judgment rendered by the Court of King's Bench, confirming, with a modification, a judgment of the Superior Court in favour of the claimants in the course of a liquidation under the Dominion \"Winding-Up Act,\" Upon the merits I think the issue which the contestant seeks to raise is of sufficient importance to warrant leave being granted.\nThe claimants, however, assert that leave cannot be granted because section 69 of the \"Supreme Court Act\" applies and, the application for leave having been made after the expiry of sixty days from the date of the judgment a judge of this court has not jurisdiction to grant leave. Goodison Thresher Company v. Township of McNab[1]. They also maintain that the interest of the contestant in the judgment for $109,545.10, as a shareholder of the company in liquidation against which it was rendered, is not shewn to amount to $2,000.\nI am disposed to think that \"the amount involved in\" the proposed appeal (section 106 of the \"Winding-Up Act\") is to be measured by the amount of the judgment against which it is sought to appeal, because, if the appeal be wholly successful, that judgment will be reversed. If this were the only objection to the jurisdiction I should probably make the order asked for.\nBut the question as to the application of section 69 of the \"Supreme Court Act\" to appeals in winding-up cases is so important that, if at liberty to do so, I should refer this motion to the full court. That, however, I have not the power to do. I hesitate to make an order which might prove embarrassing to other members of the court who may hereafter have to deal with such applications. Should I refuse the present motion the contestant cannot proceed further in this court, as no appeal would lie from the order, and there is no provision for leave being obtained from the court a quo such as is made by section 48 (e) of the \"Supreme Court Act.\" On the other hand should I grant leave unconditionally, upon the hearing of the appeal the court might, upon application, or su\u00e2 sponte hold that section 69 applies and precludes an appeal not brought within sixty days from delivery of the judgment appealed from, and the costs of printing would be lost.\nReasons may be suggested why it is desirable that there should be power in winding-up cases to grant leave to appeal after the expiry of sixty days from the pronouncing of the judgment below. The effect of that judgment may not be fully perceived until the\nwinding-up proceedings have further developed. On the other hand it is most desirable that there should be no undue delay in liquidations.\nThe applicant relies upon the decision of this court in Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Department of Agriculture[2], in support of his contention that section 69 of the \"Supreme Court Act\" does not apply to appeals under the \"Winding-Up Act,\" because the right to appeal is conferred by section 106 of the \"Winding-Up Act,\" and he contends that section 69 of the \"Supreme Court \"Act\" should be restricted in its application to cases in which the right of appeal is conferred by the \"Supreme Court Act.\" Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Department of Agriculture2, however, is distinguishable in more than one respect from the case now being dealt with\u2014notably in this, that by virtue of sub-section 7 of section 56 of the \"Railway Act,\" appeals from the Board of Railway Commissioners are subject to the rules and practice governing appeals from the Exchequer Court. In order to give the parties an opportunity to obtain the opinion of the court upon both questions of jurisdiction, I think the proper course will be to make an order granting leave to appeal (without prejudice\u2014if such a saving proviso is not superfluous\u2014to the right of the claimants to contest the jurisdiction of the court) upon the contestant undertaking to put in the usual security for costs within ten days and to launch and bring on before the court at its February sittings a motion to affirm jurisdiction. The question of the applicability of section 69 can be thus finally and satisfactorily disposed of before the expense of printing is incurred.\nThe costs of the present motion should be costs in the appeal.\nOn the 1st February, 1916, the required security was taken and acknowledged before Mr. Justice Trenholme, one of the judges of the court appealed from. On the 8th February, 1916, the present application was made to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nG. G. Stuart K.C. for the motion, cited Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. The Department of Agriculture of Ontario[3] ; Cot\u00e9 v. The James Richardson Co.[4]; Robinson, Little & Co. v. Scott & Son[5].\nR. C. Smith K.C. contra, cited Flatt v. Ferland[6] ; Kinghorn v.

Simmoneau[11]; Canada Mutual Loan and Investment Co. v. Lee[12]. The Chief Justice.\u2014I am of opinion that section 104 of the \"Winding-Up Act\" only applies to appeals referred to in sections 102 and 103 and has no application to appeals to the Supreme Court of Canada provided for by section 106. I have already so held in an application (not reported) before me some time ago under the same Act.\nI am also of opinion, an appeal haying been given in winding-up cases by virtue of section 43 of the \"Supreme Court Act\" and the \"Winding-Up Act\" (R.S.C., 1906, ch. 144), that sections 69 and 71 of the \"Supreme Court Act\" apply to this case, which sections provide as follows:\u2014.\nSec. 69.\u2014Except as otherwise provided, every appeal shall be brought within sixty days from the signing or entry or pronouncing of the judgment appealed from.\nSec. 71.\u2014Notwithstanding anything herein contained the court proposed to be appealed from, or any judge thereof, may, under special circumstances, allow an appeal although the same is not brought within the time hereinbefore prescribed in that behalf.\n2. In such case, the court or judge shall impose such terms as to security or otherwise as seems proper under the circumstances;\n3. The provisions of this section shall not apply to any appeal in the case of an election petition.\nIn the case of Goodison Thresher Co. v. Township of McNab[13] it was held that where an application for leave to appeal from the Court of Appeal for Ontario, under section 48, was made, this court had no power to grant leave after 60 days have expired, although the court below had attempted by its order to extend the time for appealing to the Supreme Court. The same view was expressed by this court in the recent case of Eillman v. Imperial Elevator and Lumber Co.[14], where the leave asked for in this court was under section 37 of the \"Supreme Court Act.\" I think the principle of these cases must also apply to motions for leave under section 106 of the \"Winding-Up Act\" and as the application admittedly comes after the sixty days have expired this court has no power to grant the leave asked for.\nThe motion to affirm jurisdiction should be dismissed with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellant seeks an order affirming the jurisdiction of this court. I am unable to find any authority founded on statute, or rule having force of statute, or otherwise governing the practice of this court, or recognized jurisprudence of the court relative to practice, for such a motion being made to the court.\nThe reason appellant gives for such a course is that the expenses of printing case and proceeding to hearing would be heavy.\nTo avert that the rules numbers 1 to 5 were passed and I think should have been followed. An application to the registrar is the only means of getting an order affirming the jurisdiction. The application is there thrashed out before a competent officer in such a way that if there is any wish to appeal from his decision the parties come before the full court knowing exactly wherein the respective difficulties lie and we have then the benefit of the registrar's judgment in writing.\nAn opportunity is thus given each of us before the hearing to understand what is involved. This new method involves, to begin with, a waste of time to ourselves and those concerned in probably more substantial business for our consideration. It seems to me for this, if for no other reason, the motion should be dismissed\nThere can be no harm done, however, in our expressing an opinion, now that the argument has been heard so long as it is understood the doing so is not to be adopted as a precedent.\nTwo questions are raised as to the jurisdiction to hear the appeal which is sought against a judgment dismissing an appeal to the Court of King's Bench in Quebec under the \"Winding-Up Act\"\nOne is that the \"matter in controversy\" does not amount to the sum or value of \"two thousand dollars.\"\nIt seems that the appellant was recognized as having a status to represent the rights of the company in the winding-up proceedings by virtue of his being a shareholder in the company being wound up thereby. By section 85 of the Act a shareholder or creditor is put in the same class as the liquidator for the purpose of contesting claims against the company.\nHe was not seeking to assert any claim to recovery of his shares or the possible proceeds actually coming to him as result of the winding-up proceedings. Hence the question of the amount of his shares or right by virtue thereof to a dividend of what might become distributable amongst shareholders never was in question. How then can that consequential result of these proceedings ever be considered as a test of what is in controversy?\nNearly all the decisions cited by the respondent are in principle against this contention. Many of them, indeed the greater part of them, are founded upon a distinction between the direct and the consequential results and decide that it is the direct and not the consequential results that must govern. For the purposes of testing this appellant's right to appeal as representing his company the matter in controversy was the claim made by the contractors against the company which was being wound up and it was resisted by the appellant standing upon the status given him by section 85.\nIndeed, no court seems to have considered the question of what amount was likely to come to him.\nFor aught that may appear he may own the entire shares of the company or a single share.\nIf the appeal had been made by the contractors certainly they would not want this right of appeal tested in such a way as now contended for by them.\nIt is the matter in controversy that is in issue, to which we must look. Sometimes that may coincide with what an appellant personally is to reap, but not always.\nSuppose the liquidator had appealed instead of this appellant surely it could not be his personal interest that is to be the test.\nYet he and the shareholders and creditors are put by section 85 on the same footing.\nThe next question is whether the leave to appeal was and by law must be within the sixty days limit fixed by section 69 of the \"Supreme Court Act.\"\nClearly that is prim\u00e2 facie the limit of our power and unless by some clear statutory extension which does not exist in the \"Winding-Up Act\" must govern us.\nI think that the general purview of that part of the \"Winding-up Act\" bearing upon appeals indicates that the right of appeal must be exercised within the limits of whatever power exists in the court appealed to. At all events it has not expressed the contrary and hence we must act upon section 69 I refer to.\nThe decision of this court in the case of Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. The Department of Agriculture[15] does not touch the question raised herein.\nThe questions of law and jurisdiction of the Board in that case were so blended in what was submitted that if we should conclude to answer in the negative, as I did, what was submitted as question of law, then the further question allowed by a judge of this court to be appealed needed no answer.\nThe Board may have treated as question of law what was also in fact a question of jurisdiction. So long, however, as it chose to submit a question of law though involving a question of jurisdiction I felt we should answer it, for the Board could have so dealt with the matter as to get our opinion.\nIt was in such view competent for the Board to extend the time for submitting its question of law. It did so and I thought then, as appears from my opinion, they had then placed the matter in such a way as to become entitled to an answer.\nIn that view it was not necessary to consider the question of our jurisdiction to hear any further appeal allowed in that regard by one of ourselves.\nThat in fact never was in this aspect passed upon by this court.\nI, therefore, conclude appellant was too late in his application to appeal.\nI think the motion must be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J. (dissenting).\u2014The proper construction of section 106 of the \"Winding-Up Act\" (ch. 144, R. S.C., 1906), is that it imposes a further condition on the right of appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada over and above the conditions imposed by sections 69 and 71 of the \"Supreme Court Act\" (ch. 139, R.S.C., 1906). So far I am in agreement with the point of view from which Mr. Smith discussed the effect of the provisions of the two statutes.\nBut it does not, I think, follow that the right of appeal under section 106 is subject to a time limit deduced from sections 69 and 71 of the \"Supreme Court Act.\" The appellant must conform to the prescriptions of that Act, of course. In addition to that he must obtain leave under section 106. There is nothing expressly, and I can see no ground for holding that there is anything inferentially, imposing any restrictive condition as to the time within which the application for leave must be made. The intending appellant may apply within the sixty days or after the sixty days. Whenever the application is made, the judge is entitled to consider all the circumstances and among them, I must say, he is, I think, entitled to consider the lapse of time. Although the application be made within the sixty days I cannot, with respect, agree that it is not open to the judge to whom the application is made to refuse it on the ground of delay. It would not be easy to exaggerate the importance of expedition in winding-up proceedings and, finding nothing in the statute suggesting it, I will not suppose the legislature to have intended to exclude from the consideration of the judge the very important matter of delay on such an application.\nBut the intending appellant, having obtained leave, may have still another bridge to cross. If the judge of the Supreme Court has deemed it right to give leave after the expiration of sixty days the appellant has still to get his appeal allowed, and, in my judgment, section 71 applies in its entirety. He must satisfy the court to which application is made that there are special circumstances, and, in my judgment, the discretion of the court appealed from in respect of the allowance of the appeal is a discretion which it is its duty to exercise on its own responsibility. Attorney-General v. Emerson[16], at pages 56, 58, 59.\nWhere the sixty days has expired, therefore, the intending appellant must first satisfy the discretion of a judge of the Supreme Court of Canada, and having done that, he must satisfy the independent discretion of the court below that special circumstances exist justifying the allowance of the appeal notwithstanding the lapse of time.\nOn the whole the result is not unsatisfactory, I should have hesitated long before adopting a construction prohibiting an appeal after the expiration of sixty days; on the other hand, it is desirable that an appeal after sixty days should not be an easy thing; it is right there should be real obstacles.\nI am unable to concur in Mr. Smith's construction of section 71. Banner v. Johnston[17] was decided in 1871 and all provisions relating to extension of time must be read in light not only of the decision, but of the observations of the Law Lords made in that case. The language of section 71 would in itself indeed be conclusive against Mr. Smith's contention; there is a multitude of decisions upon section 71 itself supporting that view. See Cameron S.C. Practice, pp. 436 and 437. It is clear, however, that the application to have jurisdiction affirmed is premature; the jurisdiction of this court is only consummated when the security has been allowed. If the intended appellant should succeed in satisfying the appropriate court in Quebec that special circumstances exist justifying the allowance of security at this stage, then the important question would still remain whether or not the condition of section 106 that the amount involved in the appeal shall exceed $2,000 is satisfied. The time has not arrived for expressing any opinion on that point.\nStrictly, the application to affirm jurisdiction ought to be made to a judge of the Supreme Court or to the registrar exercising the powers of a judge in chambers; that is an objection, however, which in my opinion can be waived and I assume that Mr. Smith does not desire to insist upon it. I think the proper disposition of the motion at present is to direct it to stand over to give Mr. Stuart an opportunity to apply for the allowance of the appeal under section 71.\nAnglin J. (dissenting).\u2014I understand that a majority of the court takes the view that section 69 of the \"Supreme Court Act\" is fatal to the right of appeal in this case. While of the opinion that that section applies because the judgment of the court of appeal is appealable under the \"Supreme Court Act\" as a judgment of the court of last resort in the province in a proceeding instituted in a superior court, subject, of course, to the special conditions imposed by the \"Winding-Up Act,\" I am, for the same reason, of the opinion that section 71 of the \"Supreme Court Act\" also applies and that an extension of time might be obtained thereunder. Brodeur J.\u2014We have to determine whether section 69 of the \"Supreme Court Act\" applies to appeals in winding-up cases.\nThe \"Winding-Up Act\" contemplates that the procedure in liquidation proceedings should be summary (sec. 133, ch. 144, R.S.C., 1906), and it provides that the appeal from the court of original jurisdiction be restricted to a limited number of cases (sec. 101, ch. 144, B.S.C., 1906). In that respect there is a departure from the right of appeal exercised under the Code of Civil Procedure (arts. 43 and 44, C.P.Q.). Besides it is provided also that the leave of a judge of the court from which there is an appeal has to be secured before a case might be brought before the Court of King's Bench (sec. 101, ch. 144, R.S.C., 1906).\nThere would be no appeal to the Court of Review because that court is not mentioned in the \"Winding-Up Act\" as one of the courts to which an appeal shall lie (sec. 102, ch. 144, R.S.C., 1906), though in ordinary cases an appeal would lie to that court from any final judgment of the Superior Court.\nIn our \"Supreme Court Act\" there is no specific reference to appeals from orders or proceedings under the \"Winding-Up Act,\"\nSection 46 of the \"Supreme Court Act\" declares that:\u2014\nNo appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court from any judgment rendered in the Province of Quebec in any action, suit, cause, matter or other judicial proceeding unless the matter in controversy\n(a) Involves the question of the validity of an Act * * *\n(b) Relates to any fee of office, duty, rent revenue or any sum of money payable to His Majesty or to any title to lands or tenements, annual rents and other matters or things where rights jn future might be bound, or\n(c) Amounts to the sum or value of $2,000. The section adds that if the right to appeal depends upon the amount in dispute such amount shall be the amount demanded and not that recovered if they are different.\nThat is the code of appeals affecting the Province of Quebec. Does it apply in winding-up proceedings? I do not think so because the \"Winding-Up Act\" has determined, in section 106, the cases in which there would be an appeal to this court. It says:\u2014\nAn appeal, if the amount involved therein exceeds $2,000 shall by leave of a judge of the Supreme Court of Canada lie to that court from\n(b) the Court of King's Bench in Quebec.\nThe differences between appeals in winding-up proceedings and those in the other cases are very numerous. First, there is no appeal de plano as in the judgments rendered by the provincial courts. The law requires leave from a judge of this court and, in considering the application, the judge must consider whether the case involves matters of public interest or some important question of law (Be Montreal Cold Storage and Freezing Co.; Ward v. Mullin[18]).\nThe amount involved in the appeal and not the amount demanded should determine the jurisdiction of this court.\nIn cases coming from Ontario the amount involved in the appeal should be $2,000, though in ordinary cases the sum of $1,000 would be sufficient to give us jurisdiction (sec. 48, \"Supreme Court Act\").\nWe may then conclude that our jurisdiction concerning cases originating in liquidation proceedings should be determined by the \"Winding-Up Act\" and not by the \"Supreme Court Act\"\nNow the question is raised that this appeal should not be allowed because it was not under the provisions of section 69 of the \"Supreme Court Act\" brought within 60 days from the date of the judgment appealed from.\nWe find in the \"Winding-Up Act\" the first part of section 104 which declares that the appeals should be regulated as far as possible according to the practice in other cases of the court appealed to. Then section 69 of the \"Supreme Court Act\" applies. It reads as follows:\u2014\nExcept as otherwise provided, every appeal shall be brought within sixty days from the signing or entry or pronouncing of the judgment appealed from.\nAs the application for obtaining leave admittedly comes after the 60 days have expired, I come to the conclusion that we have no jurisdiction to entertain this appeal.\nThe motion to affirm the jurisdiction of this court should be dismissed with costs.\nMotion dismissed with costs.\n[1] 42 Can.

Duff and Brodeur JJ. contra.\nMOTION to quash for want of jurisdiction an appeal from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario affirming the judgment at the trial by which the plaintiff\u2019s action was dismissed.\nThe motion to quash an appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Division raised the single question whether or not a creditor\u2019s action to set aside a conveyance as fraudulent under the statute of Elizabeth brought in question the title to real estate and so gave the Supreme Court Jurisdiction to entertain the appeal, which in all other respects was admittedly incompetent, under section 48 subsection (a) of the Supreme Court Act.\nG.F. Henderson K.C. for the motion referred to Lamothe v. Daveluy[1].\nChrysler K.C. contra. THE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I agree with Mr. Justice Idington.\nDAVIES J.\u2014The claim of the plaintiff in this case was that a conveyance made to the defendant Margaret Scott, wife of the defendant Cornelius Scott by a third party for an alleged valuable consideration should be declared void as against the plaintiff because made for the purpose of defeating and delaying the plaintiff in the recovery of his claim against the defendant Cornelius and as being in contravention of the Statute of Elizabeth.\nThe trial judge found\nthere was no fraud in the transaction and no intent on the part of either defendant to defeat, delay or hinder any creditor of Cornelius Scott in the recovery of any debt.\nThat was the real substantial question in controversy between the parties and on this finding of the trial judge he dismissed the action.\nOn appeal to the Appellate Division of Ontario the judgment of the trial judge was confirmed and the appeal dismissed.\nThe defendant now moves to quash an appeal to this court from the judgment of the Appellate Division on the ground of want of jurisdiction. The motion is made on the grounds that the claim of the plaintiff is in amount too small in itself to give jurisdiction and that the title to lands is really not directly in question though collaterally and indirectly it may be said to be so.\nBut the collateral effect or consequences of our judgment are not the test of our jurisdiction and the real substantial question upon which both courts passed and which was the question in controversy between the parties and on which an appeal, if allowed, to this court must alone turn would be the existence of a fraudulent intent to defeat creditors of Cornelius Scott by taking a conveyance of certain lands in the name of his wife. Canadian Mutual Loan and Investment Co. v. Lee[2]. See also Lamothe v. Daveluy[3].\nThe decisions of the court below on that question of fraudulent intent in the negative settled and determined the action which was thereon properly dismissed.\nUnder these circumstances I do not think we should affirm our jurisdiction to hear an appeal on the ground that title to land is in question, because it is clearly only so indirectly and collaterally and the real question upon which the result of an appeal must depend is one of fraudulent intent to defeat creditors.\nIf the conveyance should be set aside, it would only be as against the plaintiff and other creditors of Cornelius Scott; and so far as appears, the claims of Scott\u2019s creditors are very much less than $1,000.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014I think the motion to quash ought to prevail. It has been decided more than once that these cases merely seeking execution out of lands alleged to have been conveyed to defeat creditors, involve no question of title to land or any interest therein within the meaning of sec. 48 of the \u201cSupreme Court Act,\u201d and must exhibit a creditor\u2019s interest exceeding one thousand dollars to give this court jurisdiction in such an appeal.\nI can conceive of a case founded on a creditor\u2019s right to relief, developing in its progress or defence something that in fact raised an issue where title to land might be involved, but that does not appear in this case.\nThe motion should be allowed with costs.\nDUFF J. (dissenting)\u2014On principle it appears to me to be very clear that a question of title to lands arises. The question arises in this way. The action is an action brought for a declaration that the husband, the judgment debtor, had a beneficial interest in the lands, the legal title to which stands in the name of the wife, which interest is available for the satisfaction of the judgment creditor\u2019s debt. I am unable to understand on what principle it can be said that such an action does not involve a question of title to land. The analogy is only superficial between such an action and some others; an action by a creditor, for example, to set aside a conveyance of property which was intended by the debtor to pass his beneficial as well as his legal interest on the ground that the conveyance is impeachable under the statutes prohibiting preferences or an action to set aside a voluntary conveyance on the ground that the intention was to benefit the grantee at the expense of the grantor\u2019s creditors or an action to set aside a conveyance for consideration on the ground that the real object and intent was to defeat creditors although in point of fact the conveyance was intended between the parties to pass not only the legal but the beneficial title to the grantee. Such actions are not based upon an allegation that the judgment debtor has a title but that the title though vested in the grantee has been acquired by fraud and is held primarily subject to a charge in favour of creditors. A claim that land standing in the name of another is really the property of the judgment debtor stands in my opinion on a different footing. ANGLIN J.\u2014I concur in the opinion of Mr. Justice Davies.\nBRODEUR J. (dissenting)\u2014This is a motion to quash for want of jurisdiction.\nThe plaintiff asked by his declaration that the property held by the defendant\u2019s wife, Mrs. Margaret Scott, had always been the property of the husband, Cornelius Scott.\nThe question now is whether under section 48 of the \u201cSupreme Court Act\u201d we have jurisdiction to entertain the appeal.\nThe respondent relies on the case of Lamothe v. Daveluy[4]. That case was an \u201cactio Pauliana\u201d brought to set aside the contract for sale of an immovable in Quebec and it was decided that such an action is a personal one and does not relate to a title to land so as to give a right of appeal to this court.\nThe actio Pauliana is peculiar to the Province of Quebec and though there is a great deal of divergence of opinion, it seems to be settled law that this is a personal action and not a real action. That was the basis of the decision in Lamothe v. Daveluy4.\nIn the present case, the matter in controversy is whether the transfer made by the husband to his wife is valid and whether the husband should not be declared to be the absolute owner of the property. It is asked that it be declared that the deed passed between husband and wife was simulated and that virtually she is holding the property as a trustee for her husband.\nIt is then no more a personal action resulting from a personal right as in the actio Pauliana; but it is an action concerning title to real estate and should be considered as falling under the provisions of 48(a).\nThe motion to quash should be dismissed.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: E. Traver.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Meredith & Fisher.\n[1] 41 Can. S.C.R. 80.\n[2] 34 Can. S.C.R. 224.\n[3] 41 Can. S.C.R. 80.\n[4] 41 Can. S.C.R. 80.\n",

Tucker V. Young (30 Can. S.C.R. 185) followed.\nAn order in the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan was made extending the time for appealing beyond the sixty days limited for bringing the appeal by the \"Supreme Court Act,\" under sec. 71. On an application, under section 37 (c) of the \"Supreme Court Act,\" for special leave to appeal,\u2014\nHeld, also, following Goodison Thresher Co. v. Township of McNab (42 Can. S.C.R. 694), that, notwithstanding the order extending the time for appealing made in the court appealed from, the Supreme Court of Canada had no jurisdiction to grant special leave for an appeal after the expiration of the sixty days limited for bringing appeals by section 69 of the \"Supreme Court Act.\"\nMOTION for special leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan[1], affirming the judgment of Newlands J., at the trial, maintaining the plaintiffs' action with costs.\nThe motion was made, ex parte, on written consent filed, in the circumstances stated in the judgment now reported.\nChrysler K.C. for the motion, on behalf of the appellant.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This is a motion for leave to appeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan, under section 37c of the \"Supreme Court Act\" which gives an appeal by leave of the Supreme Court of Canada from a judgment in an action, suit, etc., not originating in a superior court. If there is power to grant leave the case is eminently one for granting it. The writ was issued in the District Court for the purpose of enforcing a mechanic's lien. The appellant's proceedings in that court were not continued but, instead of issuing a new writ, by consent of the parties the proceedings were transferred to the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan, and the statement of claim, pleadings and proceedings have all been in that court, the intention between the parties being that the plaintiff should be in the same position as if he had issued a new writ. Unfortunately, according to Tucker v. Young[2] it did not have that effect. It was held in that case that an action begun in the County Court, in Ontario, and removed under the provisions of the \"Judicature Act\" into the High Court was not appealable to the Supreme Court of Canada as the action had not originated in a superior court.\nWhen the case first came to this court, Mr. Lafleur having doubts as to this court's jurisdiction, had the case struck from the list. The plaintiff then applied to the Chief Justice of Saskatchewan, with the consent of the defendants, and obtained an order, professedly under section 71 of the \"Supreme Court Act,\" which gives to the court below the power to allow an appeal, although the same was not brought within the sixty days prescribed by section 69. Section 37, however, does not give the court below power to grant leave to appeal in a case of this kind, and it has been held by this court in The John Goodison Thresher Co, v. The Township of McNab[3], that section 71 does not authorize the court below to extend the time for bringing an appeal so as to confer power on this court to grant leave to appeal where the application to this court for leave to appeal is made under section 48e.\nI do not see how it is possible to distinguish this case from the Goodison Case (1) so as to hold that the order of the Chief Justice of Saskatchewan will authorize this court, after the sixty days, to grant leave to appeal.\nMotion refused with costs.\n[1] 8 Sask.

Such interest is not exempt from taxation under sub-section 1 of section 250 of the \"Rural Municipality Act,\" nor under section 125 of the \"British North America Act, 1867.\" Calgary and Edmonton Land Co. v.

L.R. 725, affirmed, Fitzpatrick C.J. and Duff J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta [1] affirming the judgment of Harvey C.J. at the trial, by which the plaintiff's action was maintained with costs.\nThe action was to recover the amount of taxes claimed by the municipality rated upon the assessment of lands held by the company under an agreement with the Minister of The Interior for the Dominion of Canada whereby certain tracts of Dominion Crown lands were, on certain conditions, agreed to be sold to the company for irrigation purposes under the provisions of the \"Irrigation Act,\" R.S.C., 1906, chap. 61. The company expended large sums in irrigation works upon the lands but, at the time of the assessment and the imposition of the taxes sought to be recovered, the works had not been completed according to the conditions of the agreement with the Minister and the lands had not been granted to the company but still remained ungranted Crown lands of the Dominion of Canada, subject to the agreement that they should be granted to the company upon fulfilment of the conditions as to the construction of the irrigation works and the payment of the stipulated price to be paid therefor by the company.\nThe issues raised on the present appeal are stated in the judgments now reported. I. C. Rand for the appellants.\nChrysler K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting).\u2014The respondent, plaintiff in the action, sued the appellant as occupant of certain lands in the municipality for taxes assessed thereon for the year 1913.\nThe action raises various questions of importance on which I do not desire to express any opinion, confining myself to the single point which I think necessary for the decision of the case.\nChief Justice Harvey, in his reasons for judgment, says:\nIt is well settled that the interest of a person in Crown lands may be taxed. It is also perfectly clear by the terms of the \"Rural Municipality Act\" that it is the intention to tax such interests.\nI will assume the first proposition and as to the second I do not know that I am much concerned, the question being, I think, whether the intention, if such there were, has been carried out by the statute.\nSo far as the particular case is concerned I have come to the conclusion that there is nothing in the statute imposing on the appellant a liability for the taxes sought to be recovered.\nThe \"Rural Municipality Act\" (Alberta statutes, 1911-12, chap. 3, sec. 250), provides that in every municipality all land shall be liable to assessment and taxation with the exceptions therein mentioned, the first of these being lands belonging to Canada or to the province. Then section 251, in part:\nthe assessor shall assess every person the owner or occupant of land in the municipality and shall prepare an assessment roll in which shall be set out (a) the name of the owner and the name of the occupant of each lot or parcel of land in the municipality which is not exempt from taxation; * * * (2) Such assessment roll shall be in the form following or to the like effect.\nThere is nothing in this form concerning lands exempt from assessment and taxation.\nIt is clear, therefore, that sections 250 and 251 make no provision whatever for the assessment and taxation of exempted lands, their owners or occupants. But then section 251 has been amended by section 30 of chapter 7 of the statutes of 1913 (1st sess.). There is no change except that paragraph (a) of subsection 1 is repealed and, in its place, is substituted the following:\nThe name of the owner of every lot or parcel of land in the municipality which is not exempt from assessment and the name of the occupant of any lot or parcel of land within the municipality which is exempt from assessment.\nWhat may be the effect of this incongruous direction for the insertion on the assessment roll of the names of occupants of lands exempted from assessment it is unnecessary to inquire; it is sufficient to point out that by itself it is quite incompetent as a law imposing taxation on the occupants of lands which are not liable to assessment or taxation.\nSection 250, which is the charging section, imposes no liability on the occupants of exempted lands and section 251 is merely concerned, pursuant to section 249, with directions to the assessor as to the manner of preparing the assessment roll.\nIn the \"Town Act,\" 1911-12, ch. 2, passed on the same day as the \"Rural Municipality Act\" there is, in section 266, after a statement of the lands exempt from assessment the following provision:\n3. If any land mentioned in the two preceding clauses is occupied by any person otherwise than in an official capacity the occupant shall be assessed therefor, but the land itself shall not be liable. A similar provision to the one in the \"Town Act\" is to be found in section 82 of the \"Village Act,\" 1913, ch. 5, which was passed on the same day as the Act amending the \"Rural Municipality Act.\"\nThese provisions are the same as one to be found in the Consolidated Statutes of Upper Canada, ch. 55, section 9, subsection 1.\nThere is another argument in favour of the above conclusion to be drawn from the fact that the Act contemplates nothing but the levy of taxes upon the assessed value of land, which value is to be its actual cash value (sections 249 and 252). Chief Justice Harvey says that it is well settled that the interest of a person in Crown lands may be taxed. \"May be taxed,\"\u2014but there is not a word in this Act about the taxation of the interest of a person in Crown lands. The interpretation of \"occupant\" by section 2 is of the widest character and, amongst others, includes\nany person having or enjoying in any way or to any degree or for any purpose whatsoever the use of land exempt from taxation.\nIf the occupant is taxed at all then no matter what his interest in such lands may be, no matter what the value of such interest may be, he is to be held liable for the full amount assessed on the cash value of the land. Whilst I am not prepared to say that the legislature could not impose such a tax without reference to the value of the taxpayer's interest, I think it would require to be done in plain and unmistakeable language such as we certainly have not got here.\nThough couched in rather obscure language there are some directions evident in the \"Town Act\" for assessing the interest of the occupant as may be seen in section 269 and the form given in section 270. In the \"Village Act\" the difference is clearly recognized in section 84 which provides, in part,\nthe secretary-treasurer shall prepare an assessment roll which shall set out (a) the name of the owner and in case the land is exempt from taxation under this Act, the name of the occupant thereof and, etc.; (b) a brief description of each such lot or parcel of land, the number of acres which it contains, the nature of the interest therein of each person assessed in respect thereof and the assessed value of such interest.\nAgain it is to be noted that the whole scope of the Act is dealing with the land alone. It provides for the forfeiture of lands for non-payment of taxes. There is no such provision for selling and conveying only the interest of the occupant in Crown lands as we find in the Consolidated Statutes of Upper Canada, ch. 55, sec. 138, continued through intermediate statutes to the \"Assessment Act,\" R.S.O. 1914, ch. 195, sec. 157.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs.\nMr. Justice Anglin says:\nIt is in regard to lands exempt from taxation only that there is any provision for the assessment of an occupant.\nThis may be open to question; grammatically the words \"the use of land exempt from taxation\" at the end of the definition of \"occupant\" have no reference to the first and second classes of persons mentioned but only to the third and fourth. Section 251 provides that the assessor shall assess any person the owner or occupier of land in the municipality and, by the original para. (a), the assessor is to set out the name of the owner and the name of the occupant of each lot of land not exempt from assessment. It seems possible that the amending Act meant to preserve this provision of section 251 as regards the occupant of lands not exempted.\nHowever that may be, it is clear that in the Act itself there is no express provision for assessing lands exempted from taxation or the occupiers thereof. Then the only provision regarding such lands is the amended section 251 (a) and that, in itself, is quite incompetent to impose any taxation.\nBut apparently Mr. Justice Anglin would hold that the amendment of section 251 (a) necessitates a different reading of all the taxation provisions in the Act and notably section 250 which provides that\nin every municipality all land shall be liable to assessment [except] 1.\u2014All lands belonging to Canada or to the province.\nHere Mr. Justice Anglin would read land, as defined in section 2, para. 15, to include any estate or interest therein.\nThis interpretation would have had its application to the section of the Act before the amendment of section 251 (a), yet admittedly the Act did not originally tax exempted land, its owner or occupier.\nDAVIES J.\u2014The controversy in this appeal raises several questions. One the constitutional validity of those sections of the \"Rural Municipality Act\" which, it is contended, impose liability for assessment and taxes upon the \"occupant,\" as therein defined, of land exempted from assessment and taxation; and the other whether even if intra vires the clauses really authorize the imposition of taxes upon an \"occupant\" of exempted land; and, assuming they do so, whether the defendant, appellant, is such an \"occupant\" under the facts stated in the record as makes it liable to be assessed and taxed for them.\nUnder the interpretation clause of the Act, the \"owner\" of lands not exempt from taxation and the \"occupant,\" within the meaning of that term, of exempted lands are to be so assessed and consequently liable for the assessment. \"Land\" is defined, for the purpose of assessment and taxation, to mean\nland or any estate or interest therein exclusive of the buildings or other improvements thereon\nand \"improvements\" to mean\nany increase in the value of the land caused by any expenditure of either labour or capital thereon.\nSections 249, 250 and 251 are the sections which, construed in the light of the interpretation sections, relating to the terms \"owner,\" \"occupant\" and \"land,\" have to determine the questions for our decision.\nThe scheme of the Act appears to be to make all lands within the province liable to be assessed and taxed at their prairie value, or value without improvements, which, not being exempt from taxation, are held by an \"owner\" as defined, or, being so exempt, are held or possessed or entitled to be so by an \"occupant,\" as defined, and to make such owner or occupant as the case may be liable for the taxes so assessed.\nSection 249 is as follows:\nAll municipal taxes shall be levied equally upon all ratable land in the municipality according to the assessed value of such land and it shall be the duty of the assessor to make the assessment of such land in the municipality in the manner hereinafter provided.\nSection 250: In every municipality all land shall be liable to assessment and taxation subject to the following exemptions:.\n1. All lands belonging to Canada or to the province.\nThe other exemptions do not affect this case.\nSection 251: As soon as may be in each year, but not later than the first day of July, the assessor shall assess every person the owner or occupant of land in the municipality and shall prepare an assessment roll in which shall be set out as accurately as may be\u2014\n(a) The name of the owner of every lot or parcel of land in the municipality which is not exempt from assessment, and the name of the occupant of any lot or parcel of land within the municipality, which is exempt from assesments and post office address, if known, of every such owner or occupant. (b) A brief description of each such lot or parcel of land, the number of acres which it contains and the assessed value thereof.\n(2) Such assessment roll shall be as in the form following or to the like effect or in such form as may be prescribed from time to time by the Minister:\nSo that by these sections \"municipal taxes\" are to be levied equally upon \"all\" ratable land in the municipality according to the assessed value of such land\nand the assessor is bound to assess every person the owner or occupant of land in the municipality\nand to prepare an assessment roll setting out, as accurately as may be, the name of every owner of every lot or parcel of land in the municipality not exempt from assessment and the name of the \"occupant\" of every lot or parcel which is \"exempt.\"\nThe appellant company is the assignee of an agreement made, in 1906, between the Minister of the Interior of Canada and one Robins whereby the Crown agreed to sell and Robins agreed to purchase a large tract of land in Alberta at a specified price for irrigation purposes, expenditure on these works approved by the Crown to be credited on the purchase money and balance to be paid in cash.\nAll available lands in two defined sections were allocated by order-in-council to this agreement and the lands in question in this appeal are within one of these sections. No questions as to selection or availability are involved. At the date of the assessment in dispute about $5,000,000 had been spent by the appellant upon these lands in irrigation works and it was estimated that it would take another $2,000,000 to complete the works. Under clause 7 of this Robins agreement, provision is made entitling the purchaser\nto complete the purchase and take title for any part of the lands applied for after not less than $100,000 has been expended in connection with the works. The purchase money was made payable in six annual instalments beginning the 1st July, 1910. Clause 10 provided that\nany of the lands that remain unsold at the expiration of 15 years from the date of these presents shall revert to the Crown.\nNow under the facts of this case as they appear in the record, and of which I have sketched above the merest outline, I do not entertain any doubt that the appellant at the time of the assessment complained of was an \"occupant\" of these lands within the meaning of that term as interpreted by the statute and to such an extent as to render it liable to be assessed and taxed in respect of them. Its rights under the Robins lease, licence or agreement from the Crown, whatever you may choose to call it, were such as to entitle it to enter upon the lands and make the irrigation improvements. As a fact it did so enter and had made an expenditure of some millions of money for these improvements.\nThe legal title to the land was it is true still in the Crown but the company's right to extinguish that title and obtain its patent under the agreement was clear as and when it chose to do so.\nBeyond any doubt it had an equitable and beneficial interest in these lands capable of being enjoyed and enforced as against the Crown and such an interest as I cannot doubt comes within the very words of the interpretation of \"lands\" in the Act.\nAs such it seems to me to come within the decision of this court in The Calgary and Edmonton Land Company v. The Attorney-General of Alberta[2]. The interest of the appellant in these lands was a beneficial one and the facts of the case, I agree with the courts below, bring it within the interpretation clause of \"occupant\" as above set out and within the principle upon which the Calgary and Edmonton Land Company's Case [3] was decided by this court. The interest of the Crown, whatever it might have been, could not of course be taxed but the beneficial or equitable title of the appellant was certainly not exempted under the \"British North America Act, 1867.\"\nIt seems to me, therefore, that the only question open is whether the language of the \"Rural Municipality Act\" covers such a case as this and such an interest in these lands as under the agreement the defendant appellant had. I have already set out the clauses of the Act and in my judgment these clauses are comprehensive and clear enough to enable that beneficial and equitable interest of the appellant In these lands to be assessed and taxed and to impose upon the company a liability to pay them as found by the judgments appealed from.\nFor these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nDUFF J. (dissenting) \u2014I think the appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014Two questions are presented on this appeal:\u2014\n(a) Whether, the appellant company is an \"occupant\" of certain lands within the meaning of the assessment clauses of the Alberta \"Rural Municipality Act\" of 1911-12 (chap. 3), as amended by chapter 7 of the statutes passed in the first session of 1913: (b) Whether the taxation in question offends against section 125 of the \"British North America Act,\" by which it is enacted that\nno land or property belonging to Canada * * * shall be liable to taxation.\nBy an agreement, made in 1906, under section 51 of the \"Irrigation Act\" (R.S.C., chap. 61) His Majesty the King, represented by the Minister of the Interior, agreed to sell, and the assignors of the appellant agreed to purchase 380,573 acres of land within a defined tract at the price of $3 an acre, of which $2 might be paid by crediting expenditure to be made by the purchasers on irrigation works approved by the Grown, and the balance in cash. At the instance of the company all available lands in two defined sections were allocated by order-in-council to this agreement and it was provided that the balance of the agreed acreage should be selected by the purchaser from available lands in another section. The lands in question are within one of the two former sections and their availability is not in question. The works were approved, and their construction authorized under section 20 of the \"Irrigation Act\" on the 16th March, 1909, and at the date of the assessment in question about $5,000,000 had been spent on them and it was estimated that a further expenditure of about $2,000,000 would complete them. After the company had spent $100,000, under clause seven of the agreement, it was entitled\nto complete the purchase and take title for any part of the lands -applied for.\nThe purchase money was made payable in six equal annual instalments, of which the first fell due on the 1st July, 1910. All land unsold on the 26th June, 1921, reverts to the Crown. There is no evidence that title to any lands had been acquired under the seventh clause of the contract, but it is conceded that in the tracts specified there are 412,041 acres of available lands.\nThe appellant was assessed as \"occupant\" of the lands under sections 249-251 of the \"Rural Municipality Act\" of 1911-12, as amended by chapter 7 of the statutes passed at the first session of 1913. The material parts of the legislation, as so amended, are as follows:\u2014\nSection 2. In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires, the expression\n(8) \"Owner\" means and includes any person who appears by the records of the Land Titles Office for the land registration district within which such land is situated, to have any right, title or interest in the land within the limits of the municipality other than that of a mortgagee or incumbrancee not exempt from taxation.\n(9) \"Occupant\" includes the inhabitant occupier, or, if there be no inhabitant occupier, the person entitled to an absolute or limited possession; any person holding under a lease, licence, permit or agreement therefor; any person holding under an agreement of sale or any title whatsoever, and any person having or enjoying in any way or to any degree or for any purpose whatsoever, the use of land exempt from taxation. ****\n(15) \"Land\" or \"property\" includes lands, tenements and hereditaments and, for the purpose of assessment and of taxation only, \"land\" means land or any estate or interest therein exclusive of the value of the buildings or other improvements thereon.\nSection 249. All municipal taxes shall be levied equally upon all ratable land in the municipality according to the assessed value of such land and it shall be the duty of the assessor to make the assessment of such land in the municipality in the manner here in after provided.\nSection 250. In every municipality all land shall be liable to assessment and taxation subject to the following exemptions:\n(1) All lands belonging to Canada or to the province.\n*******\nSection 251. As soon as may be in each year but not later than the first day of July the assessor shall assess every person the owner or occupant of land in the municipality and shall prepare an assessment roll in which shall be set out as accurately as may be\n(a) the name of the owner of every lot or parcel of land in the municipality which is not exempt from assessment and the name of the occupant of any lot or parcel of land within the municipality which is exempt from assessment and post-office address, if known, of every such owner or occupant.; (b) a brief description of each such lot or parcel of land, the number of acres which it contains and the assessed value thereof.\nUnder sub-section 15 of section 7 of the \"Interpretation Act,\" chap. 3 of the Alberta statutes of 1906\u2014the expression \"person\" includes any body corporate and politic.\nThe judgment of the learned Chief Justice, who tried the action, rested upon his view that the fact that\nthe defendant is entitled to become owner of the lands upon compliance with the terms of the purchase agreement\" brings it \"within the definition of the word 'occupant' in the Act,\" it being \"perfectly clear by the terms of the 'Rural Municipality Act' that it is the intention to tax such interests.\nIn delivering the judgment of the Appellate Division, Mr. Justice Walsh apparently proceeded upon what he regarded as\na written admission in the record \"that the defendant is the holder of the land * * * under and by virtue of the contract in question,\" the assignment thereof to it and the orders-in-council relating to it.\nBut the only admission to that effect which I can find in the record is contained in a document entitled\nFacts admitted by the plaintiff for the purposes of the trial herein.\nThere is no such admission by or on behalf of the defendant.\nIn its statement of defence\nthe defendant denies that it was in 1913, or in any year, the occupant of any of the lands in the statement of claim mentioned,\nand, in the document of admissions by the plaintiff, it is stated that \"the defendant is not in actual occupation of the lands mentioned.\"\nThe first question, therefore, is whether upon the finding of the learned trial judge (which the documents in evidence appear to justify) that at the date of the assessment the defendant was entitled, upon compliance with the terms of its contract of purchase, to become the owner of the lands in question, as lands definitely allocated thereto, it should be held to be a \"person entitled to a limited possession,\" or a \"person holding under an agreement of sale or any title whatsoever,\" or a \"person having or enjoying in any way to any degree or for any purpose whatsoever, the use of land exempt from taxation.\"\nHaving regard to the terms in which \"owner\" is defined in the sub-section immediately preceding, and to the obvious purpose made manifest by the provisions of section 251, I have no difficulty in reading into sub-section 9, defining \"occupant,\" immediately after the words, \"absolute or limited possession,\" the words, \"of land exempt from taxation.\" It is in regard to such lands only that there is any provision for the assessment of an \"occupant.\" [Sec. 251 (a).]\nThe lands which the defendant company is entitled to acquire are within the tract for the improvement of which by irrigation its system of works is designed and approved, as the agreement itself shews and section 51 of the \"Irrigation Act\" (R.S.C., chap. 61) requires. The defendant company, no doubt, had the right, without taking the expropriation proceedings provided for by sections 28 and 29 of the \"Irrigation Act,\" to enter upon and take possession of any part of the lands in question required for the construction of its works and is thus an occupant within the words of the definition,\na person having or enjoying in any way or to any degree or for any purpose whatsoever the use of land exempt from taxation;\nand also as \"a person entitled to a limited possession.\" Having regard to the definition of \"land\" as meaning \"lands, tenements and hereditaments and any estate or interest therein,\" the company is likewise a \"person holding under an agreement of sale.\" A person may hold though he does not occupy. A tenant of a freehold is a person who holds of another; he does not necessarily occupy. Rex v. Ditcheat[4].\nTwo persons may be \"holding\" the same lands in distinct rights and with distinct interests. Ward v. Const[5]. Under an agreement to purchase land the interest of the purchaser is \"held\" by him although he should have neither possession nor an immediate and unconditional right to possession; and it is unquestionably an interest in the land. Williams v. Papworth[6]. The courts of Saskatchewan, in my opinion, have rightly held that the appellant was an \"occupant\" of land exempt from assessment within section 251 of the \"Rural Municipality Act\" and that its \"interest therein\" was assessable and liable to taxation, being \"ratable land\" under section 249, and \"land\" under section 250.\nSo long as the assessment is confined to the interest in the land with which the Grown has parted to such an occupant, it neither exceeds the power of\ndirect taxation within the province in order to the raising of a revenue for provincial purposes\nconferred on the province by clause 2 of section 92 of the \"British North America Act,\" nor conflicts with the exemption of \"lands or property belonging to Canada\" under section 125 of that Act. This court has so held in Calgary and Edmonton Railway Co v. Attorney-General of Alberta[7]; and in Smith v. Rural Municipality of Vermilion Hills[8].\nIt was argued, however, that because section 249 directs the levying of taxes\nupon all ratable land in the municipality according to the assessed value of such land and section 251 (b) requires the assessor to state the assessed value of each lot or parcel of land, exempt or not exempt, and section 252 requires that \"land shall be assessed at its actual cash value\", the subject of assessment and taxation is the land itself and not merely the interest therein of the \"occupant.\" But this construction ignores not only the provision of clause 15 of the interpretation section under which, unless the context otherwise requires, \"land\" may be read \"interest in land,\" but also the facts that under section 249 only \"ratable land\" is subjected to taxation, and that the concluding clause of that section directs the assessor to make the assessment \"in the manner hereinafter provided.\" There immediately follows in the charging section (sec. 250), an explicit declaration of the exemption of \"all lands belonging to Canada,\" i.e., of the interest therein of the Crown, and, in section 251, a direction for the entry, in the case of such exempted land, of the name not of the \"owner\" but of the \"occupant\" whom the assessor is to \"assess\" for it. Sections 249 and 251 deal with land not exempt as well as with exempted land, and there is no reason why as to the former, for which the \"owner\" is to be assessed, \"land\" should not be read as meaning \"lands, tenements and hereditaments,\" and as to the latter, for which the \"occupant\" is to be assessed, as meaning an \"estate or interest therein,\" i.e., in the \"lands, tenements or hereditaments.\" Liability is thus imposed on the occupant personally as well as upon his \"interest\" in the land otherwise exempted. Both are \"assessed.\"\nThe intention of the legislature to provide only for the assessment of interests liable to taxation, and in nowise to impinge upon the prohibition of section 125, \"B.N.A. Act,\" seems manifest. The statute being readily susceptible of a construction which will carry out that intention and thus keep it within the legislative jurisdiction of the province, that construction should certainly be given to it rather than one from which \"it would follow as a necessary result that the statute was ultra vires.\" MacLeod v. Attorney-General for New South Wales[9]; Llewellyn v. Vale of Glamorgan Railway Co.[10]; Countess of Rothes v. Kirkcaldy and Dysart Water-Work Commissioners[11].\nThere is nothing in the record to warrant a finding that the taxes in question have in fact been imposed on anything greater or other than the ratable interest (sec. 249) of the appellant in the land, or that anything other or greater than the assessed value of such interest (sec. 249 and sec. 251 (b), which alone is ratable, the interest of the Crown being expressly declared exempt (sec. 250); has been entered upon the assessment roll. It is with an interest therein other than that of the Crown and its value only, as I read the statute, that the assessor is directed to deal in the case of land belonging to Canada.\nI would, for these reasons, dismiss this appeal with costs.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014The question in this case is whether the appellant company is an occupant within the meaning of the \"Rural Municipality Act\" of Alberta (ch. 3, 1911-12, sec. 2).\nBy that Act the municipality, respondent, is empowered to levy taxes on the owners and occupants of land of that municipality. Lands, however, belonging to the Dominion of Canada are exempt from taxation. It is provided, however, that the occupant of land exempt from taxation is liable to be assessed.\nThe \"occupant,\" says section 2 of that Act as amended in the first session of 1913 by chapter 7,\nincludes the inhabitant occupier or if there be no inhabitant occupier the person entitled to an absolute or limited possession; any person holding under a lease, licence, permit or agreement therefor; any person holding under an agreement of sale or any title whatsoever; and any person having or enjoying in any way or to any degree or for any purpose whatsoever, the use of land exempt from taxation.\nThe appellant is carrying out irrigation works in the Province of Alberta under the provisions of the Dominion \"Irrigation Act.\" The Canadian Government have agreed to sell to that company (at the price of $3 per acre) 380,573 acres within the said tract \"hereinbefore described\" if that number of acres is available, and if not as many acres in the said tract as are available for such sale and purpose.\nIn the other clauses of the agreement, the terms of payment, the construction and operation of the irrigation works, the completion of the purchase and the taking of title for any part of the lands upon certain terms are provided for.\nClause 10 provided that any of the said lands that remain unsold at the expiration of 15 years from the date of these presents shall revert to the Crown.\nBy a subsequent agreement, certain other lands were substituted for those above mentioned but the agreement of substitution was made subject to the same clauses as above described.\nIt is pretty clear that this agreement binds the Crown to sell and the defendant to buy the available lands. Those lands which are the subject of this agreement are within the area of the Municipality of McLean. The municipality, acting under the provisions of the ''Rural Municipality Act,\u201d has assessed the land in question and claims by the present action the amount of that assessment.\nNobody will dispute the fact that the company appellant has an interest in those lands. They are under its control. It may make irrigation works upon them and can prevent anybody else from exercising that right of occupation. The company has paid instalments on the purchase price and can dispose of them in favour of settlers.\nIt seems to me then that the company enjoys for those purposes the use of lands which otherwise would be exempt from taxation. But by the fact of that enjoyment, by the fact that it has an agreement for the selling of those lands, it has become an occupant as described in section 2 of the \"Rural Municipality Act.\"\nThe agreement for sale has vested in the appellant company an estate and property in the land and from that day as owner or occupant it became liable for assessments which could be raised in connection with the land. It got the benefit of municipal institutions and should then pay its share for the maintenance of the municipality.\nThose assessments do not affect in any way the rights of the Crown because if the property had to revert to the Crown the taxation could not affect the land and could not be claimed against the Crown. That statute does not assume to impose any taxes upon any such lands as against interest of the Crown. An interest has been, granted by the Crown in the lands and taxation of the person holding that interest is not taxation of the property of Canada. A provincial legislature has the right to impose taxation upon individuals by a reference to the value of land occupied by them, even though the land should be owned by Canada. Church v. Fenton[12]; Rural Municipality of Cornwallis v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[13]; Rural Municipality of South Norfolk v. Warren[14]; Smith, v. Rural Municipality of Vermilion Hills[15]; Calgary and Edmonton Land Co. v. Attorney-General of Alberta[16].\nI am of opinion that the assessments claimed from the appellant company have been rightly made and that the judgment condemning them to pay those assessments should be confirmed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] 23 D.L.R. 88; 31 West L.R. 725.\n[2] 45 Can.

Act, 1867\" ss. 91 (24), 109-117\u2014Title to Indian lands\"\u2014Surrender\u2014Sale by Commissioner\u2014Property of Canada and provinces\u2014Construction of statute\u2014\" Indian Act,\" 39 V. c. 18\u2014R.S.C. 1886, c. 43, s. 42\u2014Words and phrases\u2014\"Reserve\"\u2014\"Person\"\u2014\"Located Indian\"\u2014Evidence\u2014Public document\u2014Legal maxim.\nPer curiam.\u2014The \"Indian Act,\" 39 Vict., chap. 18, does not prohibit the sale by the Crown to an \"Indian\" of public lands which have, on surrender to the Crown, ceased to be part of an Indian \"reserve,\" nor prevent an individual of Indian blood, who is a member of a band or tribe of Indians, from acquiring title in such lands. The use of the word \"person\" in the provisions of the \"Indian Act\" (39 Vict., chap. 18, s. 31; R.S.C, 1886, chap. 43, sec. 42), relating to sales of Indian lands, has not the effect of excluding Indians from the class entitled to become purchasers of such lands on account of the definition of that word in the interpretation clauses of the statutes in question.\nPer Idington J.\u2014Crown lands of the Province of Canada, situate in Lower Canada, which had not (as provided by the statute 14 and 15 Vict., chap. 106), been surveyed and set apart, as intended to be vested in the Commissioner of Indian Lands for Lower Canada, and appropriated to the use of Indians prior to the 1st July, 1867, do not fall within the definition of \"Lands reserved for the Indians\" in the 24th item enumerated in section 91 of the \"British North America Act, 1867\" and, consequently, did not pass under the control of the Government of the Dominion of Canada at the time of Confederation. In regard, therefore, to the lands in question the presumption is that they then became vested in the Crown in the right of the Province of Quebec, and, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the Attorney-General for Canada cannot now enforce any claim of title to such lands in the right of the Dominion.\nPer Duff and Anglin JJ.\u2014The order-in-council of 1869, authorizing the acceptance of a surrender, and the surrender pursuant thereto by the Indians of the \"reserve\" within which the lands in question are situate are public documents the recitals in which are prim\u00e2 facie evidence of the facts stated therein (Sturla v. Freccia (5 App. Cas. 623), at pp. 643-4, referred to). Evidence is thereby afforded that the band of Indians occupied the tract of land in question as a \"reserve\" and the principle \"omnia pr\u00e6sumuntur rite esse acta\" is sufficient to justify, prim\u00e2 facie, the conclusion that the order-in-council of 1853, respecting the constitution of the reserve, was carried out and that the occupation thereof by the Indians was legal. Consequently, the rights acquired by the Indians constituted ownership, the surrender by them to the Crown was validly made and the lands passed under the control of the Government of Canada, at the time of Confederation, in virtue of the provisions as to \"Lands reserved for the Indians\" in section 91 of the \"British North America Act, 1867.\" St. Catherine's Milling and Lumber Co. v. The Queen (14 App. Cas. 46), distinguished.\nJudgment appealed from (Q.R. 24 K.B. 433), affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side[1] affirming the judgment of Letellier J., in the Superior Court, District of Chicoutimi, dismissing the action.\nThe circumstances of the case are stated in the judgments now reported.\nG. G. Stuart K.C. and L. P. Girard for the appellant.\nL. G. Belley K.C., for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The appellant, the Attorney-General for the Dominion of Canada, claims in this suit to have it declared that the Crown is the owner of a certain half-lot of land, being lot No. 3 of the first range, Canton Ouiatchouan, in the Parish of St. Prime and County of Lake St. John. In the first paragraph of the amended declaration it is stated that the Crown has always been and still is the owner of the lot No. 3. This, however, is only inaccurate drafting of which there is much in the record. There is no doubt that the claim of the Crown is only to the south-east half of lot No. 3, and it is not disputed that the respondent has a good title to the northwest half of lot No. 3, The respondent has been in possession of the whole of lot No. 3 for upwards of a quarter of a century during which time the Government has taken no effective steps to question his right to any part of the lot.\nBy an order-in-council, dated August 9-11, 1853, approval was given to a schedule shewing the distribution of land set apart under the statute 14 & 15 Vict., ch. 106, for the benefit of the Indian Tribes in Lower Canada. Included in this schedule was a reservation in favour of the Montagnais of Lake St. John. The half-lot in question was comprised in this reservation.\nOn the 25th of June, 1869, the Montagnais Band of Indians surrendered to the Crown, for sale, a portion of the reservation including lot No. 3. This land so surrendered was put up for sale and it would appear that on the 21st June, 1873, the north-west half-lot No. 3 was sold to the respondent and, on the 7th May, 1878, the south-east half-lot was sold to one David Philippe.\nUnder a judgment obtained by the mis-en-cause, O. Bouchard, against D. Philippe the latter's half of lot No. 3 was sold at a sheriff's sale to the respondent on the 7th March, 1889.\nThe Crown alleges that David Philippe was an Indian, that he was, at the time of the sheriff's sale, in possession of the land on which he had been located by the Crown and that, consequently, the Crown still held the half-lot as \"Indian Lands\" and as such liable neither to taxation nor to execution.\nThe fallacy in this argument is in the statement that David Philippe had been located on the land; it involves the proposition that, whilst all the other lots into which the reserve had been divided were sold outright to their purchasers, this particular half-lot was not sold to the purchaser David Philippe, but that, being an Indian, he was only \"located\" on the land in the meaning of that term in the \"Indian Act.\"\nTo shew the impossibility of supporting such a contention it is only necessary to turn to the sections in point in the statute. The Act in force on the 7th May, 1878, the date of the sale to David Philippe, was the \"Indian Act, 1876\" (39 Vict., ch. 18). Section 3 is as follows:\u2014\n3. The following terms contained in this Act shall be held to have the meaning hereinafter assigned to them unless such meaning be repugnant to the subject or inconsistent with the context.\n(3) The term \"Indian\" means:\nFirst, any male person of Indian blood reputed to belong to a particular band * * *\n(6) The term \"Reserve\" means any tract or tracts of land set apart by treaty or otherwise for the use or benefit of or granted to a particular band of Indians of which the legal title is in the Crown, but which is unsurrendered. * * *\n(8) The term \"Indian Lands\" means any reserve or portion of a reserve which has been surrendered to the Crown. * * *\n(12)\"The term \"person\" means an individual other than an Indian, unless the context clearly requires another construction.\nBy Section 5, the Superintendent-General\nmay authorize that the whole or any portion of a reserve be subdivided into lots.\nSection 6:\n6. In a reserve or portion of a reserve subdivided by survey into lots, no Indian shall be deemed to be lawfully in possession of one or more of such lots, or part of a lot unless he or she has been or shall be located for the same by the band, with the approval of the Superintendent-General. Section 7:\n7. On the Superintendent-General approving of any location as aforesaid he shall issue in triplicate a ticket granting a location to such Indian.\nSection 8:\nThe conferring of any such location-title as aforesaid shall not have the effect of rendering the land covered thereby subject to seizure under legal process or transferable except to an Indian of the same band.\nThe statute, it will be observed, makes provision for the conferring of a location-title only on a reserve, that is on unsurrendered lands and then by the band, not by the Crown.\nThen after sections 25 and following, dealing with surrenders of reserves to the Crown, we have sections 29 and following under the caption \"Management and Sale of Indian Lands.\" There is no suggestion in these sections, or anywhere else in the Act, that Indian lands may not be sold to an Indian.\nI suppose it may well be that it would not be a common occurrence for an Indian to be a purchaser at a sale of Indian lands, but it is one thing to say the statute did not contemplate this and quite another to say that it intended to forbid it. I can imagine no reason why an Indian should not purchase such lands; there is no doubt as to his capacity to hold real estate. This is recognized by section 64, which provides that :\nNo Indian or non-treaty Indian shall be liable to be taxed for any real or personal property, unless he holds real estate under lease or in fee simple, or personal property, outside of the reserve or special reserve, in which case he shall be liable to be taxed for such real or personal property at the same rate as other persons in the locality in which it is situate.\nThis really disposes of the appellant's case but, out of respect for the learned judge of the Court of King's Bench who dissented from the majority of the court and one of whose points is taken up in the appellants' factum, a few words may be added. The whole ground of the dissenting opinion is really in the following paragraph:\nLes Indiens d'une tribu localis\u00e9e sur une r\u00e9serve pourraient se r\u00e9unir en conseil d'une mani\u00e8re solennelle et d\u00e9cider (si la majorit\u00e9 de la bande le voulait) de remettre tout ou partie de cette r\u00e9serve \u00e0 la Couronne et alors la Couronne vendrait ou disposerait de ce qu'elle re\u00e7evrait ainsi, dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de la tribu indienne et pour son b\u00e9n\u00e9fice exclusif, mais \u00e0 la condition\u2014dont la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 se voit tr\u00e8s bien\u2014de ne jamais vendre une partie quelconque de ces r\u00e9serves \u00e0 des sauvages-. On a m\u00eame pris le soin de dire que toute \"personne\" pourrait devenir acqu\u00e9reur de ces propri\u00e9t\u00e9s mais qu'un sauvage ne pourrait pas \u00eatre une de ces personnes.\nI am myself quite unable to appreciate the necessity or occasion for any such condition as the learned judge suggests but it is unnecessary to discuss this because, as far as I have been able to ascertain, it is purely imaginary. The judge says further on:\nCe nomm\u00e9 Phillippe \u00e9tait un sauvage, et la loi d\u00e9fendait positivement qu'un sauvage p\u00fbt acqu\u00e9rir cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nNo reference is given and I know of no such prohibition, positive or otherwise.\nThe point taken in appellant's factum that a \"person,\" as defined by the \"Indian Act,\" does not include an Indian has reference to the section dealing with certificates of sale which is section 31 of 39 Vict., ch. 18 and section 42 of chapter 43, Revised Statutes of Canada. There seems to be some obscurity about this section because the marginal note which has been carried through all the amendments and revisions of the Act is \"Effect of former certificates of sale or receipts.\" The section, however, seems to look to future certificates and, as I apprehend, is designed to meet the inconvenience of delay in the issue of patents. Be that as it may, the section does not provide that any \"person\" may purchase these lands but that an Indian may not be one of these \"persons\": all that it does provide is that a certificate of sale or receipt for money, duly registered as therein mentioned, shall give the purchaser the same rights as he would have under a patent from the Crown.\nThe definition of terms is, at the commencement of section 3, said to apply only when not inconsistent with the context and this is emphasized by its special repetition in the 12th item in which the word \"person\" is defined. I cannot think that such an accidental use of the word \"person\" for \"purchaser\", or any other word to indicate him could possibly be held to involve by inference a positive law against an Indian becoming a purchaser for which prohibition there is no other warrant. I think in such case the context would clearly require another construction.\nBut this is not all; the appellant has assumed that the case is governed by the \"Indian Act,\" chapter 43 of the Revised Statutes of 1.886, but this is not so, and when we look at the \"Indian Act\" of 1876 we find that the word \"person\" does not occur at all in the extract quoted by the appellant which sets forth what the certificate of sale or receipt for money shall entitle the purchaser to. The word used is \"party\" shewing conclusively that the legislature had no intention, even by an inference through the interpretation section, to prevent the acquisition by an Indian of Indian lands put up for sale.\nThe word \"party\" is several times used when distinctly intended to include both \"persons\" and \"Indians.\" See sections 12 and 14.\nThis substitution in the revised statute of the word \"person\" for the word \"party\" is an instance of the danger attending such changes in the revision of the statutes. Obviously the revisers had no idea of enacting an important law by the change they made but regarded it simply as a linguistic embellishment; it has, however, misled two of the judges of the Court of King's Bench into finding a positive law against the sale of Indian lands to an Indian.\nAt the hearing I was considerably impressed with the argument that, even if there had never been a valid sale to David Philippe, the transactions between Euch\u00e8re Otis, the local agent of the Superintendent-General, and the respondent constituted a sale to the latter which was also confirmed by the Department of Indian Affairs. If, however, the views that I have previously expressed are correct it is unnecessary to consider this point further. If the sale to David Philippe, in 1878, was good, the Crown had nothing left to grant to Giroux in 1889.\nJudge Pelletier, delivering the dissenting judgment in the Court of King's Bench, says that he has endeavoured to find in the record the necessary grounds for confirming the judgment, since such confirmation (if it could be legally given) would seem to him more in accordance with equity. With this view I agree and it is therefore satisfactory to be able to conclude that the judgment is in conformity not only with equity in its most general meaning but also with the law.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellant seeks to have the Crown declared the proprietor of part of a lot of land in Quebec and respondent removed therefrom and ordered to account for the fruits thereof for the past twenty-six years.\nThe circumstances under which the claim is made are peculiar and some novel questions of law are raised. Much diversity of judicial opinion in the courts below seems to exist relative to some of these questions.\nTo put the matter briefly, the appellant claims that the land in question is part of a tract of land known as an \"Indian Reserve,\" which had become vested by virtue of certain legislation in the Crown, in trust for a tribe of Indians; that part of it was thereafter surrendered by the tribe to the Crown for purposes of sale for the benefit of said tribe; that this part of the lot now in question was in course of time sold to an Indian of said tribe; that he paid five 25\/100 dollars on account of the purchase; that thereafter, under a judgment got against him, the land was sold by the sheriff to respondent for $500; that thereupon he paid to the Indian Department $164 as the balance of the purchase-money due the Crown, and procured the receipt therefor, which appears hereinafter, from the local sales agent of the Indian Department; that he then went into possession and improved the land and has remained so possessed ever since till, according to assessed values, it has risen from being worth only $500 in 1889, when respondent entered, to be worth $3,200, in 1913, when this litigation was pending; that the Indian purchaser was incapacitated by statute from buying lands in a \"Reserve\"; and that the sheriff's sale was, as part of the result, null and void and hence that respondent got nothing by his purchase.\nTo realize the force and effect of these several allegations we must examine the statutes upon which the rights of the Indians rested, their, powers of surrender thereunder, and the effect of the \"British North America Act\" under and by virtue of which the claim of the appellant is asserted.\nThe Parliament of Old Canada, by 14 & 15 Vict. ch. 106, enacted:\nThat tracts of land in Lower Canada, not exceeding in the whole two hundred and thirty thousand acres, may, under orders-in-council to be made in that behalf, be described, surveyed and set out by the Commissioner of Crown Lands, and such tracts of land shall be and are hereby respectively set apart and appropriated to and for the use of the several Indian Tribes in Lower Canada, for which they shall be respectively directed to be set apart in any order-in-council, to be made as aforesaid, and the said tracts of land shall accordingly, by virtue of this Act, and without any price or payment being required therefor, be vested in and managed by the Commissioner of Indian Lands for Lower Canada, under the Act passed in the session held in the thirteenth and fourteenth years of Her Majesty's Reign, and intituled, An \"Act for the better protection of the Lands and Property of the Indians in Lower Canada.\"\nIn the last mentioned Act, chapter 42 of 13 & 14 Vict., there is enacted:\nIt shall be lawful for the Governor to appoint from time to time a Commissioner of Indian Lands for Lower Canada in whom and in whose successors by the name aforesaid all the lands or property in Lower Canada which are or shall be set apart, or appropriated to or for the use of any tribe or, body of Indians, shall be and are hereby vested in trust for such tribe or body and who shall be held in law to be in the occupation and possession of any lands in Lower Canada actually occupied or possessed by any such tribe or body in common or by any chief or member thereof or other party for the use or benefit of such tribe or body and shall be entitled to receive and recover the rents issues and profits of such lands and property, and shall and may, in and by the name aforesaid, be subject to the provisions hereinafter made, exercise and defend all or any of the rights lawfully appertaining to the proprietor, possessor or occupant of such land or property.\nIn the evidence in the case there is a certified copy of an order-in-council of August, 1853, which reads as follows:\u2014\nOn the letter from the Honourable Commissioner of Crown Lands, dated 8th June, 1853, submitting for approval a schedule shewing the distribution of the area of land set apart and appropriated under the statute 14 & 15 Vict., ch. 106, for the benefit of the Indian Tribes in Lower Canada.\nThe Committee humbly advise that the said schedule be approved and that the lands referred to be distributed and appropriated as therein proposed.\nThis is vouched for by a certificate of the Assistant-Commissioner of Crown Lands, in 1889.\nThe schedule referred to in the said order-in-council does not appear in evidence. Neither does the fetter.\nThere does, however, appear a schedule in the case, certified by the same Assistant-Commissioner of Crown Lands and of same date as last mentioned certificate. This on its face cannot be the schedule referred to in said order-in-council. It is as follows:\u2014 SCHEDULE\nShewing the distribution of the area of land set apart and appropriated under the Statute 14th and 15th Vict., Ch. 106, for the benefit of Indian Tribes in Lower Canada.\nCounty\nTownship or Locality.\nNo. of Acres.\nDescription of Boundaries.\nNames of the Indian Tribes.\nRemarks.\nPeribonca River.\n16,000\nA tract five miles on the River Peribonca, north of Lake St. John.\nMontagnais of Lake St. John and Tadoussac.\nIndians having their hunting grounds along the Saguenay and its tributaries.\nSurveyed.\nExchanged for a tract on the west shore of Lake St. John.\nSurveyed.\nSaguenay\nMetabetchouan\n4,000\nThe ranges 1st and C. south of Lake St. John.\n(And other lands)\nCertified a true copy of the original of record in this Department.\n(Sgd.)

I may remark that the marginal note\nSurveyed. Exchanged for a tract on the west shore of Lake St. John. Surveyed.\ncannot have formed part of an order-in-council in 1853. That note is something evidently written in after the date of the order-in-council and I infer has been a note made by someone in reference to an exchange proposed on 4th September, 1856, to which I am about to refer.\nWho wrote it? When was it written? By what authority?\nThe certificate seems as presented in the case to be placed higher up than the note at left hand side and signed by Mr. Wauhebe. It is probable, however, the certificate was intended to present this note as part of the original record purported to be certified to.\nWhat then does the date signify in this note? It is of February, 1858. Who was Mr. Wauhebe? What office did he fill? What was the purpose of the extract as it left his hands? Was the marginal note part of what he seems to be certifying to?\nThe importance of a definite answer to these queries and all implied therein becomes apparent when we find that the title of the Crown, as represented by appellant, depends upon the effect to be given the most indefinite terms of an order-in-council of the 4th September, 1856, which is as follows:\u2014\nOn the application of the Montagnais Tribe of Indians of the Saguenay, thro' David E. Price, Esq\u2019r, M. P. P. for the appointment of Mr. Georges McKenzie as interpreter and to distribute all moneys or goods given to the Tribe; and for the grant of a tract of land on Lake St. John, commencing at the River Ouiatchouanish, to form a township of six miles square; also, that the grant of \u00a350 per annum, may be increased to \u00a3100, and continue annually.\nThe report from the Crown Land Department dated 25th July, 1856, states that the tract of land set apart for the Montagnais Indians, lies in the Township of Metabetchouan, west side of the river of that name and that this land, together with the tract at Peribonca, north side of Lake St. John, are still reserved for those Indians, but that as they appear desirous of obtaining a grant of the land at Pointe Bleue, on the western border of Lake St. John, there appears no objection to an exchange.\nThe Committee recommend that the exchange be effected and the grant made accordingly.\nCertified,\n(Sgd.) Wm. H. Lee,\nC. E. C.\nTo the Supt.-Gen'l Indian Affairs,\netc., etc., etc.\nCertified a true copy.\nDuncan Scott.\nDeputy Superintendent-General of Indian Affairs\nThere is nothing in the case to explain what was done pursuant to this order, and when, if anything ever was done. There is nothing in the printed case shewing any definite survey ever was made of the lands thus recommended to be given in exchange for the lands which had been allotted to some Indians.\nThe Act of 14 & 15 Vict., ch. 106, makes it clear by the above quotation therefrom that orders-in-council setting apart land for the use of Indians should be described, surveyed and set out by the Commissioner of Crown Lands, and that only in such event can such tracts of land be considered as set apart and appropriated for the use of the Indians.\nAgain, it is clearly intended by the earlier enactment of 13 & 14 Vict. that the lands intended to be vested in the Commissioner of Indian Lands are such as have been set apart or appropriated to the use of Indians. When we consider that the lands to be so vested by virtue of those Acts are to be only lands which have been surveyed and set apart by the Commissioner of Crown Lands, it is very clear that something more than an order-in-council,\" such as that produced, merely approving of the proposed scheme of exchange, was needed to vest lands at Point Bleue in the Commissioner of Indian Lands. Yet, strange to say, there is nothing of the kind in the case or anything from which it can be fairly inferred that the necessary steps ever had been taken.\nCounsel for the appellant referred to a blue print in the record; and I understood him to suggest it was made in 1866.\nExamining it, I can find no date upon it; but I do find another plan purporting to be a survey made by one Dumais, P. L. S., in 1866. Probably it is by reference thereto he fixed the date of the blue print, if I understood him correctly.\nThis latter plan has stamped upon it the words \"Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, Canada\"; and inside these, set in a circle, are the words \"Survey Branch, True, Reduced Copy, W. A. Austin, 18.6.00.\" I infer that probably the latter plan is but a reduced copy of the former and that both refer to some survey made in 1866.\nSo far as I can find from the case, or the record from which the case is taken, the foregoing presents all there is entitling appellant to assert a title in the Crown on behalf of the Dominion.\nClearly the order-in-council recommending an exchange, without more, furnishes no evidence of title.\nIt might be said with some force, but for the constitutional history of Canada involved in the inquiry, that what we do find later on furnishes something from which after such lapse of years some inferences might be drawn. There are two difficulties in the way. All that transpired after the 1st of July, 1867, when the \"British North America Act\" came into force, can be of no effect unless and until we have established a state of facts, preceding that date, which would enable the \"British North America Act\" by its operation to give control of the said lands to the Crown on behalf of the Dominion.\nBy section 91, sub-section 24 of said Act, one of the subject matters over which the Dominion Parliament was given exclusive legislative authority was \"Indians and Lands reserved for Indians.\"\nThe question is thus raised whether or not the lands in question herein fall definitely within the term \"Lands reserved for Indians.\"\nThe Dominion Parliament, immediately after Confederation, by 31 Vict., ch. 42, asserted its legislative authority over such lands as reserved for Indians.\nAll that took place afterwards relative to the lands in question can be of no effect in law unless the alleged reserve had been duly constituted on or before the 1st July, 1867.\nIt seems impossible on such evidence as thus presented to find anything bringing the lands in question within the scope of and under the operation of the \"British North America Act.\"\nBut there is another difficulty created by the enactment, in 1860, by the Parliament of Old Canada of 23 Vict., ch. 151, sec. 4, which provides as follows:\u2014\n4. No release or surrender of lands reserved for the use of Indians, or of any tribe or band of Indians, shall be valid or binding except on the following conditions.\nThis is followed by two sub-sections which specify the steps which must be taken to enable a surrender to be made. It is to be observed that this was passed within three years and ten months from the order-in-council recommending, the exchange made of the lands on the Peribonca and Metabetchouan rivers held as reserves for the Indians in question.\nIf the survey and setting apart contemplated by the proposed exchange was not made and fully completed by the 30th June, 1860, when the bill, which had been reserved by the Governor in May, was assented to, the completion of that exchange would require the due observance by the Indians of the form of surrender imperatively required by the last mentioned Act.\nThere is nothing to indicate this ever was complied with. Hence surveys made in 1866, or any time after 30th June, 1860, cannot help without evidence of such compliance.\nThere is no evidence of any Indians in fact having been found on the Pointe Bleue reservation before the year 1869.\nIf one had to speculate he might infer something took place between 1866 and 1869. But we are not at liberty do do so, or found a judgment herein for appellant, without evidence or only upon the merest scintilla thereof.\nThe appeal therefore fails in my opinion. I think the distinction claimed by Mr. Stewart to exist between reserves duly constituted under the Acts above referred to, whereby the land became vested in commissioners in trust, and such reserves as involved in the case of St. Catherine's Milling and Lumber Company v. The Queen[2], and some other cases referred to, was well taken.\nBut, as this case stands, there being no evidence of the land having been duly vested before 1st July, 1867, in commissioners in trust, or otherwise falling within the operation of the \"British North America Act,\" section 91, sub-section 24, the presumption is in favour of the land being vested in the Crown on behalf of Quebec. Assuming, for argument's sake, that there is any evidence upon which to find the land vested in the Crown on behalf of the Dominion and that there is evidence of a sale by the Crown to David Phillippe, upon which he paid only five 25\/100 dollars, how does that help the appellant?\nAdmitting the invalidity of the sale and nullity of the sheriff's sale, and discarding both as null, there is evidence which goes far to establish the recognition by the Crown of the respondent as the purchaser. The local agent gave respondent the following receipt:\u2014\nRoberval, Pointe Bleue, 22 juin, 1889.\n$164.32.\nRe\u00e7u de M. Pierre Giroux la somme de cent soixant et quatre piastres et 32 cents, en payement du \u00bd lot S. E. No. Rang 1er. du Township Ouiatchouan suivant instruction de Dep. et avec contrat de Vente pour le dit \u00bd lot.\nL. E. Otis, A.S.\nAnd the Department of Indian Affairs, at Ottawa, set down in its books a recognition of respondent as purchaser.\nIt would have been, I incline to think, quite competent for the Crown under all the circumstances, and without any detriment either to the trust or anything else, to have taken the position in 1889, as may be inferred was done, that the said receipt and entry in the books should stand forever as a final disposition of the affair.\nThe reasons against such a course of action being taken by the Crown were of rather a technical character; even assuming Phillippe was debarred from buying, upon which I pass no opinion.\nUnder the law as it has long existed there was the possibility of recognizing any Indian qualified to be enfranchised and thereby beyond doubt entitled to become a buyer. It may be inferred even at this distance of time that if the questions now raised had, at the time when respondent was set down in the books of the department as purchaser of the lands in question, been viewed in light thereof and the foregoing circumstances and especially having regard to the fact that, in any event, Phillippe alone was to blame, and had no more substantial grievance at least none worth more than $5.25 to set up, and seeing respondent had contributed $500 to pay his debts and paid practically the whole purchase money to the Crown, no harm would have been done by letting the recognition of respondent stand.\nI must not be understood as holding that there cannot be discovered abundant evidence to cover the very palpable defects I point out in the proof of title adduced herein.\nThis is not one of the many cases wherein probabilities must be weighed.\nIt is upon the record as it presents the title to the lot in question that we must pass. Fortunately the result does justice herein even if the result of blunders in failing to produce evidence which may exist.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014The action out of which this appeal arises was brought in the Superior Court for the District of Chicoutimi, in the Province of Quebec, by the Attorney-General of the Dominion on behalf of the Crown claiming a declaration that a certain lot of land was the property of the Crown and possession of the same.\nThe three questions which it will be necessary to discuss are:\u2014 First.\u2014Was the lot in question within the limits of an Indian Reserve constituted under the authority of 14 & 15 Vict., ch. 106?\nSecond.\u2014If so, is the title vested in His Majesty in right of the Dominion of Canada or has the Attorney-General of Canada, on other grounds, a title to maintain the action?\nThird.\u2014Was a professed sale of the lot made in 1878 to one David Philipe, member of the Montagnais tribe by an agent of the Department of Indian Affairs, a valid sale?\nI shall first state the facts bearing upon the first and second of these questions. On the 9th of August, 1853, an order-in-council was passed by which certain tracts of land were severally appropriated for the benefit of the Indian tribes in Lower Canada under the authority of the statute above mentioned. Two tracts were set apart for the benefit of the Montagnais Band, one on the Metabetchouan and one on the Peribonca river in the Saguenay district. A few years afterwards, on the request of the tribe, the Governor in Council sanctioned an exchange of the Peribonca tract for a tract at Pointe Bleue, Ouiatchouan, on the western border of Lake St. John. In August, 1869, the Governor-General in Council, by order, accepted what professed to be a surrender by the Montagnais Indians of the reserve constituting the Township of Ouiatchouan which admittedly is the tract of land that the order-in-council of 1851 authorized to be substituted for the Peribonca Reserve. In view of the contention that the exchange was never effected it is desirable to set out this order-in-council and the surrender in full. They are as follows:\u2014 Copy of a Report of a Committee of the Honourable the Privy Council, approved by His Excellency the Governor-General in Council on the 17th August, 1869.\nThe Committee have had under consideration a memorandum dated 3rd August, 1869, from the Hon. the Secretary of State submitting for acceptance by Your Excellency in Council under the provisions of the 8th section of the Act, 31 Vict., Chap. 42, a surrender bearing date the 25th of June, 1869, executed at Metabetchouan, in the District of Chicoutimi, by Basil Usisorina, Luke Usisorina, Mark Pise Thewamerin and others, parties thereto as chiefs and principal men of the Band of Montagnais Indians, claiming to be those for whose benefit the reserve at Lake St. John, known as the Township of Ouiatchouan, was set apart, executed in the presence of Rev'd Dominique Racine, authorized by the Hon. the Secretary of State to receive said surrender and in that of the Hon. Mr. Justice Roy, Judge of the Superior Court in the District of Chicoutimi, such surrender conveying their interest and right in certain lands on the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th ranges of the said Township of Ouiatchouan, indicated on the copy of a map by provincial surveyor P. H. Dumais, dated A.D. 1866, attached to the said surrender and vesting the lands so surrendered in the Crown in trust to sell and convey the same for the benefit of the said Indians, and their descendants, and on condition that the moneys received in payment for the same shall be placed at interest in order to such interest being periodically divided among the said Montagnais Indians.\nThe Committee advise that the surrender be accepted and enrolled in the usual manner in the office of the Registrar-General.\nCertified,\n(Sgd.) Wm. H. Lee, Clk. P. C.\nCertified a true copy.\nDuncan Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent-General of Indian Affairs.\nSurrender by the Band of Montagnais Indians for whom was set apart the Reserve of the Township of Ouiatchouan, in the Province of Quebec, to Her Majesty Queen Victoria, of their lands in the Indian Reserve there, as described below, to be sold for their benefit. KNOW ALL MEN that the undersigned Chief and Principal Men of the above mentioned band living on the above mentioned reserve, for and acting on behalf of our people, do hereby remise, release, surrender, quit-claim and yield up to our Sovereign Lady the Queen, Her Heirs and Successors forever, all and singular those certain parcels, or tracts of land situated in the Dominion of Canada and in that part of the said Province of Quebec, being composed of concessions one, two, three, parts of four, five, six and the whole of seven and eight, in the said Township of Ouiatchouan, as described and set forth in the map or plan hereunto annexed.\nTo have and to hold the same unto Her said Majesty the Queen, Her Heirs and Successors forever, in trust, to sell and convey the same to such person or persons and upon such terms as the Government of the said Dominion of Canada shall or may deem most conducive to the interest of us, the said Chief and Principal Men and our people in all the time to come and upon the further condition that the moneys received from the sale thereof shall, after deducting the usual proportion for expense of management, be placed at interest, and that the interest money so accruing from such investment shall be paid annually, or semi-annually to us and our descendants. And we the said Chiefs and principal men of the band aforesaid do, on behalf of our people and for ourselves, hereby ratify and confirm and promise to ratify and confirm whatever the Government of this Dominion of Canada may do or cause to be lawfully done in connection with the disposal and sale of the said lands.\nIn WITNESS THEREOF, the said Chiefs and principal men have set our hands and affixed our seal unto this instrument in the said Province of Quebec, at Post Metabetchouan. Done at our Council-House this twenty-fifth day of June, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-nine.\nSigned, sealed and delivered in the presence of:\nD. Roy,\nJudge of the Superior Court and of the District of Chicoutimi. Signed by the Chief and thirty-six other Indians, members of the Band.\nSince the acceptance of this surrender the lands have been dealt with by the Department of Indian Affairs as lands surrendered, under the provisions of the \"Indian Act\" and held by the Crown under that Act.\nFirst, then, of the contention that the Ouiatchouan Reserve was never lawfully constituted. The order-in-council and the surrender registered pursuant to the order-in-council constitute, in my judgment, together, a public document within the meaning of the rule stated in Taylor on Evidence, 1769a, and the recitals in this document are, therefore, prim\u00e2 facie evidence of the facts stated. (See Sturla v. Frecc a, et al.[3] at 643-4). Evidence is thereby afforded that the Montagnais Band of Indians did occupy this tract of land as a reserve and the principle omnia pr\u0153sumuntur rite esse acta is sufficient to justify, prim\u00e2 facie, the conclusion that the order- in-council was carried out and that their occupation was a legal one.\nThe second question depends upon the character of the Indian title to this reserve at the time the \"British North America Act\" came into force. If at that time there was vested in the Crown in right of the Province of Canada an interest in these lands which properly falls within the description \"land,\" as that word is used in section 109 of the \"British North America Act,\" or within the word \"property\" within the meaning of section 117, then that interest (as it is not suggested that section 108 has any application), passed to the Province of Quebec. It is necessary, therefore, to consider the nature of the Indian title and, as that depends upon the meaning and effect of certain parts of chapter 14, C.S.L.C., it will be convenient to set out these provisions in full. They are as follows:\u2014\n7. Le gourverneur pourra nommer, au besoin, un Commissaire des terres des Sauvages pour le Bas-Canada, qui, ainsi que ses successeurs, sous le nom susdit, sera mis en possession, pour et au nom de toute tribu ou peuplade de sauvages, de toutes les terres ou propri\u00e9t\u00e9s dans le Bas-Canada, affect\u00e9es a l'usage d'aucune tribu ou peuplade de Sauvages, et sera cens\u00e9 en loi occuper et posseder aucune des terres dans le Bas-Canada, actuellement possed\u00e9es ou occup\u00e9es par toute telle tribu ou peuplade, ou par tout chef ou membre d'icelle, ou autre personne, pour l'usage ou profit de tells tribu ou peuplade; et il aura droit de recevoir et recouvrer les rentes, redevances et profits, provenant de telles terres et propri\u00e9t\u00e9s, et sous le nom susdit; mais eu egard aux dispositions ci-dessous \u00e9tablies, il exercera et maintiendra tous et chacun les droits qui appartiennent l\u00e9gitimement aux propri\u00e9taires, possesseurs ou occupants de telles terres ou propri\u00e9t\u00e9s.\n* * * * *\n8.

Tel commissaire aura, dans chaque district civil du Bas-Canada, un bureau qui sera son domicile l\u00e9gal, et o\u00f9 tout ordre, avis ou autre proc\u00e9dure pourra lui \u00eatre l\u00e9galement signifi\u00e9; et il pourra nommer des d\u00e9putes, et leur d\u00e9l\u00e9guer tels pouvoir qu'il jugera exp\u00e9dient de leur d\u00e9l\u00e9guer de temps \u00e0 autre, ou qu'il recevra ordre du gouverneur de leur d\u00e9l\u00e9guer. 13 & 14 V., c. 42, s. 2, moins le proviso.\n9. Le dit commissaire pourra conceder ou louer, ou grever toute telle terre ou propri\u00e9t\u00e9, comme susdit, et re\u00e7evoir ou recouvrer les rentes, redevances et profits en provenant, de m\u00eame que tout propri\u00e9taire, possesseur ou occupant l\u00e9gitime de telle terre pourrait le faire; mais il sera soumis, en toute chose, aux instructions qu'il pourra re\u00e7evoir de temps \u00e0 autre du gouverneur, et il sera personnellement responsable \u00e0 la couronne de tous ses actes et plus particuli\u00e8rement de tout acte fait contrairement \u00e0 ces instructions, et il rendra compte de tous les deniers par lui re\u00e7us, et les emploiera de telle mani\u00e8re, en tel temps, et les paiera \u00e0 telle personne ou officier qui pourra \u00eatre nomm\u00e9 par le gouverneur, et il fera rapport, de temps \u00e0 autre, de toutes les mati\u00e8res relatives \u00e0 sa charge, en telle mani\u00e8re et forme, et donnera tel cautionnement que le gouverneur prescrira et \u00e9xigera; et tous les deniers et effets mobiliers qu'il re\u00e7evra ou qui viendront en sa possession, en sa qualit\u00e9 de commissaire, s'il n'en a pas rendu compte, et s'ils ne sont pas employ\u00e9s et pay\u00e9s comme susdit, ou s'ils ne sont pas remis par toute personne, qui aura \u00e9t\u00e9 commissaire \u00e0 son successeur en charge, pourront \u00eatre recouvr\u00e9s de toute personne qui aura \u00e9t\u00e9 commissaire, et de ses cautions, conjointement et solidairement, par la couronne, ou par tel successeur en charge dans aucune cour ayant juridiction civile, jusqu'a concurrence du montant ou de la valeur. 13 & 14 V., c. 42, s. 3.\n12. Des \u00e9tendues de terre, dans le Bas-Canada, n'exc\u00e9dant pas en totalit\u00e9 deux cent trente mille acres, pourront (en autant que la chose n'a pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 faite sous l'autorit\u00e9 de l'acte 14 & 15, V., c. 106), en vertu des ordres-en-conseil eman\u00e9s \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, \u00eatre d\u00e9sign\u00e9es, arpent\u00e9es et reserv\u00e9es par le commissaire des terres de la couronne; et ces \u00e9tendues de terre seront respectivement reserv\u00e9es et affect\u00e9es \u00e0 l'usage des diverses tribus sauvages du Bas-Canada, pour lesquelles, respectivement, il est ordonn\u00e9 qu'elles soieut reserv\u00e9es par tout ordre-en-conseil eman\u00e9 comme susdit; et les dites \u00e9tendues de terre seront, en cons\u00e9quence, en vertu du pr\u00e9sent acte, et sans condition de prix ni de paiement, transfer\u00e9es au Commissaire des terres des Sauvages pour le Bas-Canada, et par lui administr\u00e9es conformement au pr\u00e9sent acte. 14 & 15 V., c. 106, s. 1.\nThe tract in question was set apart under the authority of section 12. Our inquiry concerns the effect of sections 7, 8 and 9 as touching the nature of the Indian interest.\nFirst. It may be observed that the Commissioner is to hold the Indian lands \"pur et au nom\" of the tribe or band and that he is deemed in law to occupy and to possess them \"pour l'usage et au profit de telle tribu ou peuplade.\" These appear to be the dominating provisions and they express the intention that any ownership, possession or right vested in the Commissioner is vested in him for the benefit of the Indians. Therefore, the rights which are expressly given him are rights which are to be exercised by him for them as by tutor for pupil.\nLooking at the ensemble of the rights and powers expressly given I can entertain no doubt that in the sum they amount to ownership. By paragraph 7 he is given a right to receive and to recover the rents and profits\net il exercera et maintiendra tous et chacun les droits qui appartiennent l\u00e9gitimement aux propri\u00e9taires.\nBy section 9:\u2014\nLe dit commissaire pourra conc\u00e9der ou louer, ou grever toute telle terre ou propri\u00e9te, comme susdit, et recevoir et recouvrer les rentes redevances et profits en provenant, de m\u00eame que tout propri\u00e9taire, possesseur ou occupant l\u00e9gitime de telle terre pourra le faire.\nThis in the sum, I repeat, is ownership; and none the less so that in the administration of the property the Commissioner is accountable to the Governor. The Governor in this respect does not represent the Crown as proprietor but as parens patri\u0153.\nIt seems to follow that, on the passing of the \"British North America Act,\" this ownership passed under the legislative jurisdiction of the Dominion as falling within the subject \"Indian Lands,\" and I see no reason to doubt that the provisions of the Act of 1868 (sec. 26, ch. 42), by which the Secretary of State, as Superintendent-General of Indian Affairs, was substituted for the Commissioner provided for by the enactments just cited as the trustee of the Indian title were well within the authority of the Parliament of Canada; nor can I see on what ground it could be contended that the provisions of the \"Indian Act\" (ch. 43, R.S.C.), providing for the surrender of Indian lands or the provisions relating to the sale of the same after the surrender are not within the ambit of that authority.\nBut it is argued that, on the surrender being made, the lands, under the authority of St. Catherine's Milling and Lumber Co. v. The Queen[4], became vested in the Crown and fell under the control of the province. There are two answers. First: The Indian interest being, as I have pointed out, ownership is by the terms of the surrender a surrender to Her Majesty in trust to be dealt with in a certain manner for the benefit of the Indians. The Dominion Parliament, having plenary authority to deal with the subject of \"Indian Lands\" and having authorized such a transfer of the Indian title, it is difficult to see on what ground the transfer could be held not to take effect according to its terms or on what ground the trusts, upon which the transfer was accepted, can be treated as non-operative.\nSecondly. If I am right in my view as to the character of the Indian title, it is obvious that any interest of the Crown was a contingent interest to become vested only in the event of the disappearance of the Indians while the lands remained unsold. If that event had taken place, it may be that there would have been a resulting trust in favour of the Crown and if the lands in such an eventuality remained unsold in the hands of the Dominion the question might arise whether as a \"royalty\" the Crown in the right of the province would not be entitled to the benefit of them. But all this has no application here. So long as the band exists the band is the beneficial owner of the land in question or of the monies arising out of the sale of them. The distinction between this case and the case of the St. Catherine's Milling Company[5], is not difficult to perceive. The Privy Council held in that case that the right of the Indians, resting on the proclamation of 1873, was a \"personal and unsufructuary right\" depending entirely upon the bounty of the Crown. The Crown had a paramount and substantial interest at the time of Confederation, which interest remained within the province. The surrender of the Indian right to the Crown (which was not, it may be observed, a surrender to the Dominion Government), left the interest of the province unincumbered. There is no analogy between that case and this, if I am right in my view that the Indian interest amounted to beneficial ownership, the rights of ownership, in some respects, being exercisable not by the Indians but by their statutory tutor, the Commissioner. The surrender of that ownership in trust under the terms of the instrument of 1868 cannot be held, without entirely defeating the intention of it, to have the effect of destroying the beneficial interest of the Indians.\nThe third question arises in this way. Professing to act under the authority of the \"Indian Act\" (ch. 18 of 1876), the Indian agent, in May, 1878, sold the lot in question to one David Philippe, a member of the Montagnais Band. On the 7th March, 1889, this land was sold by the sheriff under a judgment against Philippe, and adjudged to the respondent Giroux. The appellant alleged that Philippe was not a competent purchaser and that, by certain provisions of the statutes relating to Indians, the sale to Philippe was forbidden and that the sale was contrary to law.\nTwo distinct points are made by Mr. Stuart. First, he says that the effect of section 42 of the \"Indian Act\" (ch. 43, R.S.C., 1886), taken with section 2, sub-secs, c and h, precludes an Indian, within the meaning of the Act, from becoming the purchaser of any part of a surrendered reserve. Section 42, oh the literal construction of it might, no doubt, be held to confine the benefits of the certificate of the sale or receipt for the money received on the sale of Indian lands to a \"person\" within the meaning of section 2 (c), that is, to some individual other than an Indian. But the conclusive objection to this line of argument is to be found in the Act of 1876 (ch. 18), which was in force when Phillipe purchased. Section 31 of that Act dealt with the effect of a certificate of sale or a receipt for money received on the sale of Indian lands. It is to the \"party to whom the same was or shall be made or granted\" that the section refers and the definition of \"person\" in the interpretation section is without effect.\nThe second point made rests upon sub-section 3 of section 77 of the Act, R.S.C. 1886, ch. 43, as amended by 51 Vict., ch. 22, sec. 3. It will be convenient to set out sections 77 and 78 incorporating that amendment. They are as follows\u2014\nSec. 77. No Indian or non-treaty Indian shall be liable to be taxed for any real or personal property, unless he holds, in his individual right, real estate under a lease or in fee simple, or personal property outside of the reserve or special reserve in which case he shall be liable to be taxed for such real or personal property at the same rate as other persons in the locality in which it is situate:\n2. No taxes shall be levied on the real property of any Indian, acquired under the enfranchisement clauses of this Act, until the same has been declared liable to taxation by proclamation of the Governor in Council, published in the Canada Gazette:\n3. All land vested in the Crown or in any person, in trust for or for the use of any Indian or non-treaty Indian or any band or irregular band of Indians or non-treaty Indians, shall be exempt from taxation, except those lands which, having been surrendered by the bands owning them, though unpatented, have been located by or sold or agreed to be sold to any person; and, except as against the Crown and any Indian located on the land, the same shall be liable to taxation in like manner as other lands in the same locality; but nothing herein contained shall interfere with the right of the Superintendent-General to cancel the original sale or location of any land, or shall render such land liable to taxation until it is again sold or located.\nSec. 78. No person shall take any security or otherwise obtain any lien or charge, whether by mortgage, judgment or otherwise, upon real or personal property of any Indian or non-treaty Indian, except on real or personal property subject to taxation under the next preceding section; but any person selling any article to an Indian or non-treaty Indian may take security on such article for any part of the price thereof which is unpaid. 43 V., c. 28, s. 77.\nThe argument is that \"any Indian located on the land\" excludes an Indian purchaser under section 31 of the Act of 1876. I think that argument fails. The meaning of \"located Indian,\" I think, is made sufficiently clear by reference to sections 16, 17, 18 and 20 of the Act of 1886 and, in my judgment, clearly refers to an Indian located under those provisions, that is to say, an Indian who has been permitted to occupy part of the reserve in respect of which he has a location ticket and continues to occupy it notwithstanding the surrender of the reserve. The scheme of these sections appears to be that real estate held by an Indian within the reserve where he resides shall not be subject to taxation or to be charged by mortgage or judgment, but it does not appear to be within the scheme to exempt property purchased by an Indian as purchaser outside of the reserve on which he is living. \"Reserve,\" it may be observed, by reference to the interpretation clause, does not apply to a surrendered reserve.\nI may add that the Act does not appear to contemplate the disabling of the Indians from acquiring property and engaging in transactions outside the reserve. See section 67, for example, in addition to sections 64, 65 and 66.\nAnglin J. concurred with Duff J. Brodeur J.\u2014Il s'agit d'une action p\u00e9titoire institu\u00e9e par le Procureur-G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la Puissance du Canada demandant que la Couronne soit d\u00e9clar\u00e9e propri\u00e9taire de la moiti\u00e9 sud-est du lot No. 3 dans la premi\u00e8re concession du canton de Ouiatchouan.\nLes faits qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu au pr\u00e9sent litige sont les suivants:\nLe terrain en question faisait partie d'une r\u00e9serve sauvage \u00e9tablie en vertu de l'acte 14 & 15 Vict. c. 106. En 1869, la Bande des Sauvages Montagnais qui poss\u00e9dait la r\u00e9serve a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de c\u00e9der et abandonner entr'autres la premi\u00e8re concession du canton de Ouiatchouan. Plus tard, le 7 mai, 1878, le surintendant-g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des affaires des sauvages a vendu \u00e0 un nomm\u00e9 David Philippe, pour la somme de $26.25, la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en question dans cette cause, qui faisait partie originairement de la r\u00e9serve des sauvages mais qui \u00e9tait tomb\u00e9e dans le domaine de la Couronne \u00e0 la suite de la cession faite par la bande.\nDavid Philippe, ayant encouru certaines dettes, jugement fut rendu contre lui et la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 fut vendue par le sh\u00e9rif. Le terrain fut adjug\u00e9 au d\u00e9fendeurintim\u00e9, Giroux, qui en prit possession, le d\u00e9fricha compl\u00e8tement et en fit une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de bonne valeur.\nDes doutes ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9s par la Couronne sur la validit\u00e9 du d\u00e9cret, l'acqu\u00e9rerur Giroux, pour \u00e9viter un proc\u00e8s avec le Gouvernement, pr\u00e9f\u00e9ra prendre un titre de ce dernier et obtint de l'agent un re\u00e7u qui se lit comme suit:\nRoberval, Pointe-Bleue, 22 juin, 1889.\n$164.32.\nRe\u00e7u de M. Pierre Giroux la somme de cent soixante-et-quatre piastres et 32 cents, en paiement du \u00bd lot S.E. No. Rang 1er. du Township Ouiatchouan suivant instruction de D\u00e9partement et avec contrat de, vente pour le dit \u00bd lot.\nL. E. Otis, A.S. Cette nouvelle vente fut confirm\u00e9e et approuv\u00e9e par le Minist\u00e8re des Sauvages; elle fut \u00e9galement approuv\u00e9e par le D\u00e9partement de la Justice. Plus tard, cependant, nous voyons par la correspondance au dossier que le D\u00e9partement des Sauvages ayant demand\u00e9 l'opinion du D\u00e9partement de la Justice sur la validit\u00e9 de la vente, en all\u00e9guant que le nomm\u00e9 Philippe \u00e9tait un sauvage localis\u00e9 sur la r\u00e9serve et qu'il y avait lieu de s'enqu\u00e9rir si ce fait n'affectait pas la validit\u00e9 de la vente judiciare, le D\u00e9partement de la Justice a r\u00e9pondu que dans les circonstances, en vertu de la section 79 de \"l'Acte des Sauvages,\" telle que amend\u00e9e par 51 Victoria, ch. 12, sec. 75, la terre ne pouvait pas \u00eatre hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9e l\u00e9galement et que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 ne pouvait pas \u00eatre vendue par autorit\u00e9 de justice.\nMalgr\u00e9 cette opinion du Minist\u00e8re de la Justice aucune action ne parait avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 prise par le D\u00e9partement que vingt-deux ans apr\u00e8s la vente judiciaire.\nLa premi\u00e8re question qui se soul\u00e8ve est de savoir si un sauvage peut acheter du Gouvernement un terrain qui \u00e9tait originairement dans une r\u00e9serve mais qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 abandonn\u00e9.\nLorsque les r\u00e9serves sont abandonn\u00e9es ainsi par les sauvages, la Couronne voit \u00e0 administrer, \u00e0 vendre ou \u00e0 louer ces terrains pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice et avantage des sauvages. En vertu de la loi, elle est oblig\u00e9e de vendre ces terrains aux personnes qui se pr\u00e9sentent les premi\u00e8re et suivant les prix qu'elle d\u00e9termine.\nIl y avait du doute de savoir si le nomm\u00e9 David Philippe \u00e9tait un sauvage ou non. Un certain doute a m\u00eame \u00e9t\u00e9 exprim\u00e9 sur la bande \u00e0 laquelle il pouvait appartenir. Les uns pr\u00e9tendent qu'il \u00e9tait Ab\u00e9naquis, les autres Montagnais.\nMais en supposant m\u00eame qu'il \u00e9tait un sauvage de la tribu des Montagnais, qu'il e\u00fbt le droit comme tel de vivre sur la r\u00e9serve sauvage de la Pointe Bleue, il n'en est pas moins vrai que du moment que cette r\u00e9serve ou une partie de cette r\u00e9serve \u00e9tait abandonn\u00e9e \u00e0 la Couronne, rien n'emp\u00eachait un sauvage d'acheter un de ces terrains ainsi abandonn\u00e9s.\nLes sauvages ont, relativement aux r\u00e9serves, des droits et des obligations restreintes; mais, du moment que ces r\u00e9serves sont abandonn\u00e9es \u00e0 la Couronne, il me semble qu'un sauvage pourrait avoir le droit d'acheter un de ces terrains, de le cultiver, d'en faire les fruits siens et de jouir sous ce rapport des m\u00eames droits et des m\u00eames privil\u00e8ges que les blancs. Pr\u00e9tendre le contraire serait, suivant moi, nier \u00e0 ces sauvages le droit de se d\u00e9velopper et de faire partie d'une civilisation plus avanc\u00e9e.\n. L'appelant all\u00e9gue qu'il n'y a que les blancs cependant qui peuvent acheter ces terrains de la Couronne.\nIl n'y a pas de doute, je crois, qu'un sauvage pourrait acheter, comme n'importe quel autre colon, des terres de la Couronne; et il faudrait, suivant moi, un texte bien plus formel que celui de la section 42 qui nous a \u00e9t\u00e9 cit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9tendre que dans le cas d'une r\u00e9serve qui a appartenu jadis aux sauvages ces derniers seraient emp\u00e9ch\u00e9s de pouvoir s'y \u00e9tablir comme colons.\nLa section 42 de \"l'Acte des Sauvages\" de 1886, cit\u00e9e par M. Stuart, ne peut pas \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e comme excluant les sauvages du droit de pouvoir acheter.\nJe consid\u00e8re donc que Philippe avait le droit d'acheter ce terrain de la Couronne et que la vente judiciaire qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite est valable et que Giroux est devenu acqu\u00e9reur par bon titre de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9clam\u00e9e par l'appelant.\nMais il y a plus. En supposant que la Couronne n'avait pas le droit de vendre la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 Philippe il n'y a pas de doute qu'elle pouvait et qu'elle devait la vendre \u00e0 Giroux. Or, en 1889, la Couronne elle-m\u00eame s'est fait payer par Giroux une somme de $164.32 pour prix d'achat de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en question et le d\u00e9partement a lui-m\u00eame confirm\u00e9 cette vente qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par son agent.\nJe consid\u00e8re donc que, dans les circonstances, il ne peut pas y avoir de doute sur le droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Giroux au terrain en question et, par cons\u00e9quent, le jugement des cours inf\u00e9rieures qui a renvoy\u00e9 l'action doit \u00eatre confirm\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant : L.

The price was to be paid partly in cash and the balance in stock of the company to be delivered within six months. The promoters were unable to secure the necessary capital and the company has never been organized. In an action claiming damages for breach of the contract to de liver the stock.\nHeld, Duff J. expressing no opinion, that the time limit in the contract and circumstances disclosed at the trial, shewed that the parties intended that the stock to be delivered was that of a fully organized company.\nPer Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies J., that both parties knew when the contract was made that no such stock existed; and as it never came into existence, for which R. was not to blame, the contract could not be enforced. Idington and Anglin JJ. contra.\nPer Davies J.\u2014The contract to deliver the stock was not an unqualified one but was dependent upon the successful floatation of the bonds in the market.\nPer Duff J.\u2014The stipulation as to time in the contract was not of its essence, but R. was to have a reasonable time, the nature of the business he was engaged in being considered, for delivery of the stock; some time before the action J. abandoned his claim to the stock and demanded its value in money as damages, but up to that time there had been no breach on R.'s part and he bad done nothing to entitle. J. to claim that the contract was rescinded. Per Idington and Anglin JJ.\u2014The contract was absolute for delivery of the shares within six months or a reasonable time thereafter; the Court cannot import into it the condition of successful floatation; R. has not fulfilled his part and J. is entitled to substantial damages for the breach.\nJudgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia (49 N.S. Rep. 12), reversed, Idington and Anglin JJ. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1], varying the judgment in favour of the plaintiff at the trial by awarding substantial in lieu of nominal damages.\nThe plaintiff's action is on a contract in writing made between her husband W. H. Johnson and the defendant which is as follows:\u2014\n\"It is hereby agreed by and between William H. Johnson, of Halifax, in the County of Halifax, of the first part and William Roche, of Halifax, aforesaid of the second part: That the party of the first part agrees to sell and the party of the second part agrees to purchase four square miles of coal lands at Chimney Corner in the County of Inverness, Nova Scotia, now held by the party of the first part under leases Nos. 222, 223, 224, and 225 from the Government of Nova Scotia and which were recently under option of purchase to Mr. E. L. Thorne and in part held by the party of the first part under option of purchase from S. George Cook at present of Sydney for the price of eleven thousand dollars in cash and seventeen thousand dollars of common stock of the Margaree Coal and Railway Company, Limited, said stock to be delivered within six months from the date hereof. The cash to be paid on the delivery of the good and sufficient transfers for said coal areas and leases from the party of the first part and his co-owner S. G. Cook to the party of the second part.\"\nThe cash required to be paid under this agreement was paid on the delivery of the transfer for the four coal areas mentioned. The action is for damages for the non-delivery of the fourteen thousand dollars of the common stock of the Margaree Coal and Railway Co., the remaining three thousand of the capital stock having been assigned by Johnson to one Cook, who is not a party to the action.\nW. H. Johnson, one of the parties to the contract, made an assignment to the official assignee for the benefit of his creditors, on May 18th, 1910, which assignment included any rights Johnson might have under this contract and on January 23rd, 1911, the assignee sold the rights under the contract to W. EL Johnson's wife, the present plaintiff for the sum of $100.\nAt the date the contract with the defendant was entered into by W. H. Johnson, the Margaree Coal and Railway Co. was not carrying on business and had no property nor assets, and no stock of the company had been subscribed or issued, and up to the present time the company has not acquired any property or assets, and no stock has been issued, except a few shares to the provisional directors, and under its char ter the company never had authority to commence operations, as none of its stock has been subscribed, it being a condition in the charter that 25% of its stock must be subscribed and 10% paid up before operations could be commenced.\nJohnson was offered the requisite number of shares before the six months expired, but refused them because the company had not been organized. The trial judge held that there was a breach of contract by defendant in not delivering the stock within the six months or within a reasonable time thereafter. He also found that the shares which it was proposed to issue to Johnson were not the shares called for by the contract.\nAs to damages he found that the burden of proof was on the plaintiff to satisfy him that any damages have been sustained by the plaintiff, and that he was not satisfied from the evidence that the plaintiff had sustained any damages by the non-delivery of the stock other than nominal damages, because the shares were not and never had been of any value.\nFrom this decision the plaintiff appealed to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc on the question of damages only, and the defendant cross-appealed claiming that the action should have been dismissed with costs.\nThe Court of Appeal decided by a majority (Townshend C.J., Graham and Russell JJ.) that the cross-appeal should be dismissed and that larger damages should be awarded the plaintiff and that new evidence might be taken before a referee to assess such damages, Drysdale J., with whom Longley J. concurred, decided that the trial judge was right in awarding only nominal damages because no value could be placed upon the stock under the evidence as given at the trial. He, however, deferred to the majority of the court as to the order which should be made, namely, that further evidence should be taken as to the question of the value of the stock and a reference ordered for that purpose.\nThe defendant now appeals to the Supreme Court of Canada claiming that the action should be dismissed, or in the alternative that the trial judge was right in deciding that only nominal damages should be awarded.\nRogers K.C. and Ralston K.C. for the appellant. By the company's charter the provisional directors had power to allot stock and respondent's shares could have been delivered at any time.\nAs to the obligation to deliver see Field v. Pierce[2].\nThe shares never had any market value and substantial damages could not be recovered. Gibson v. Whip Publishing Co.[3]; Barnes v. Brown[4].\nMellish K.C. and Allison K.C. for the respondent. The market value is not the test in a case of this kind. Elbinger Actien-Gesellschafft F\u00fcr Fabrication von Eisenbahn Materiel v. Armstrong[5] ; Chaplin v. Hicks[6].\nKirschmann v. Lediard[7] is very much in point. And see Huse and Loomis Ice and Transportation Co. v. Heinze[8]; Henry v. North American Railway Construction Co.[9].\nRogers K.C. and Ralston K.C. for the appellant.\nMellish K.C. and Allison K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The plaintiff in the action claimed $16,000 damages for failure to deliver $17,000 of common stock of the Margaree Coal and Railway Co. Ltd. pursuant to an agreement dated 5th November, 1909. To the knowledge of the parties there was no such stock in existence. It may be supposed that they expected the company would shortly be in a position to issue it; difficulties however arose in raising the necessary capital and the company has never been organized.\nA careful examination of the record has convinced me that it must be assumed the parties to the agreement declared upon only intended to bind themselves on the condition that the company would be completely organized and the defendant placed in a position to deliver the stock. I am satisfied that Roche never intended to bind himself personally and that Johnson never expected or intended that he should.\nIt is well known that there can be no sale of goods which have not at least a potential existence at the time of the contract of sale. Shares in a company are not goods, but rather in the nature of choses in action. I do not think, however, this can make any difference.\nCan the respondent claim damages for breach of a contract to deliver such non-existent shares which it is obviously impossible for the appellant to do?\nThe case is different from that of a contract to deliver so many goods of a particular kind where no specific goods are to be sold, for then the contractor may be made liable in damages for breach of his contract. But in Taylor v. Caldwell[10], it was held that :\u2014\nWhere, from the nature of the contract, it appears that the parties must from the beginning have known that it could not be fulfilled unless when the time for the fulfilment of the contract arrived some particular specified thing continued to exist, so that, when entering into the contract, they must have contemplated such continuing existence as the foundation of what was to be done; there, in the absence of any express or implied warranty that the thing shall exist, the contract is not to be construed as a positive contract, but as subject to an implied condition that the parties shall be excused in case, before breach, performance becomes impossible from the perishing of the thing without default of the contractor.\nIf in cases where the particular specified thing is in existence at the time when the contract is made, a condition is to be implied that it must continue to exist at the date for fulfilment much more must such a condition be implied where the thing is not in existence at the date of the contract and both parties know that unless and until it does come into existence the contract will be impossible of performance.\nTaylor v. Caldwell[11] has been followed in later cases and notably in that of Howell v. Coupland[12], where the specific thing contracted for was not in existence at the date of the contract and it was pointed out by Lord Justice Mellish that this could make no difference in the application of the principle that if the thing perishes before the time for performance the vendor is excused from performance by the delivery of the thing contracted for.\nIf a party to a contract is relieved of his obligation to deliver where the goods, though existing at the time of the contract, have been subsequently destroyed or where though non-existent at the time of the contract they have subsequently come into existence and been destroyed, much more it would seem is he entitled to relief if the goods never come into existence at all. It seems indeed almost necessary in such case to imply a condition in the contract that the goods must come into existence, for no man could be supposed to bind himself to such an impossibility as the delivery of a non-existent thing.\nThe trafficking in shares of a company which has no existence seems a highly undesirable practice and one which I think may well be limited as far as possible certainly to the extent of not holding the contractor liable in damages for failure to deliver a particular specified thing which to the knowledge of both parties must be impossible at least until the thing comes into existence.\nI think this disposes of the only point raised in the action, though it may leave open certain questions between the parties arising out of the transaction to which it relates; these cannot be properly disposed of here.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed with costs.\nDavies J.\u2014This appeal is from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia varying the judgment of the trial judge who had awarded plaintiff nominal damages and remitting the case back to a referee for the assessment of such damages as the plaintiff might by further evidence be shewn to have sustained by reason of the breach of the defendants' obligation under the contract to deliver the plaintiff certain shares in a coal company to be organized.\nDrysdale and Longley JJ. dissented on the ground that no evidence had been given as to the value of the stock for failure to deliver which the action was brought and no attempt was made to put a value upon it and that the trial judge was right under these circumstances in awarding nominal damages only, but at the same time yielded their opinion to that of the majority and agreed to the reference.\nThe contract upon which the action was brought reads as follows: (see pages 19 et seq., ante).\nThe right of the plaintiff to maintain the action depends upon the true construction of this agreement. If it was an absolute and unconditional contract to deliver the stock as the learned trial judge held and the Court en banc confirmed and there was a breach of it on defendant's part, the only question remaining would be whether the Court en banc was right in remitting the case back to a referee to take further evidence and assess the damages.\nIn the view I take of the whole case and the proper construction to be put upon the contract, it is not necessary to discuss the reference back for assessment upon further evidence to be taken on the question of damages.\nI am of the opinion that the contract is not an absolute and unqualified one and that the defendant's obligation to deliver the stock was one dependent upon the coming into existence of a fact anticipated and hoped for by both parties, namely, the success of the Margaree Company in organizing and financing its undertaking in England or elsewhere and in floating its bonds for \u00a340,000 on the market;\nThe learned trial judge said:\u2014\nI have before me a contract absolutely clean cut, plain and simple on its face and without any ambiguity or room for conjecture or doubt as to its meaning. I must be guided by the plain, literal meaning of the words used, and I cannot go counter to them, even though I may think it very likely that both parties at the time contemplated the delivery of the stock when the company was on its feet.\nBut with the greatest possible respect, I think the learned judge had before him much more than that. He had matter and facts which made it essentially necessary to be considered in determining what was the real contractual obligation of the defendant, what it was the parties were contracting about, and what they each had full knowledge of and what under such considerations was the real intention of the parties as expressed. The substance and reality of the matter being dealt with and the real nature of the transaction have to be considered before the meaning of the defendant's obligation can be fairly determined.\nThe evidence shewed conclusively that the promoters of the Margaree Coal and Railway Company, Ltd., had been negotiating for months in England for the financing of their undertaking; and the sale of their bonds to the extent of \u00a340,000, sterling, was to enable them to operate their mines and to construct a railway from their coal lands to tide water, and the necessary terminals and that the floating of these bonds was known by both parties to the contract to be a vital and essential necessity for the success of the undertaking.\nJohnson, the plaintiff, it is true, says substantially that when he signed the contract both defendant and Morrison, the active promoter of the company, told him that the stock had been actually underwritten.\nThe defendant and Morrison positively denied that anything of the sort had been told Johnson and the trial judge accepted their testimony.\nThat testimony was to the effect that negotiations for the financing of the company were proceeding satisfactorily in London and that it was hoped they would be successful.\nUnder the facts as found by the trial judge I cannot believe that any such absolute contract as was contended for ever was intended or that the contract entered into was such.\nSuch a construction really amounted to a guarantee on Roche's part that the \u00a340,000 required would be forthcoming within the six months and the evidence satisfies me that no such intention ever existed or was thought to exist between the parties.\nI agree with the trial judge and the court en banc that the shares which it was proposed at one time to issue to Johnson were not the shares the contract called for and that both parties intended. In the literal construction, however, which is sought to be put upon the contract, but which I do not accept, there is much to be said in favour of the view that these shares offered to Johnson were a fulfilment of Roche's contractual obligation.\nJohnson, however, from the first objected and refused to accept any shares other than those in a fully organized company which had been financed so as effectively to carry out its undertaking.\nIf he had an unqualified contractual right to such shares then I think he had a right to substantial and not nominal damages and that the judgment below was right.\nHolding the view, however, of the proper construction of the contract I have above expressed I do not think the plaintiff has succeeded in proving any cause of action.\nThe conditions which he himself says governed and controlled the issue of the shares he was to receive never came into existence. No fault was or could be imputed to the defendant for this and Roche's contractual obligation was not therefore broken.\nAny remedy the plaintiff may have under the contract (on a return of the $11,000 cash paid to him) to have his interest in the coal areas restored him are not affected by this judgment.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed with costs.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014The appellant agreed with the respondent's husband to buy four square miles of coal lands for the price of eleven thousand dollars in cash and seventeen thousand dollars of common stock of the Margaree Coal and Railway Company, Limited, to be delivered within six months from the date of the agreement.\nThis agreement was so far fulfilled that the lands were transferred to appellant and the cash paid, but the stock has never been delivered. The respondent later on acquired the title to this agreement and right to sue for its breach.\nI shall not enter upon the wide field of what is the correct measure of damages the appellant should pay. I am quite clear the court below is right in holding that the damages are more than nominal and entitled to refer the assessment thereof to a referee.\nNotwithstanding a most elaborate argument well presented, there is really nothing more in this appeal.\nI may be permitted respectfully to say, however, that after paying the closest attention to the argument it seemed to me a setting up men of straw to knock them down. The fact that the respondent's husband may have seemed to imagine he was entitled to have the common shares of a company which had not only got organized, but also been so far successful in its operations as to float an issue of bonds, seems beside what we have to deal with.\nThe referee may have to consider all that, in order to determine whether or not in light of the surrounding circumstances the contract, so far as relative to the kind of common stock to be given, by implication reached so far and whether in assessing damages for its breach he can hold them, if assessable at all, properly based on such implications and thus to have been within the contemplation of the contracting parties.\nSo far as we are concerned that is not the question before us.\nAll we have to deal with involves only the question of whether or not such stock as offered, being that of an unorganized company issuing so much paper of doubtful legality and no value, can reasonably be said to have been an offering of what was within the contemplation of the contracting parties,\nI have no hesitation in answering it was not. If it had been, there was no possible meaning in providing six months for the issuing and delivery thereof.\nBetween that extreme and the other which appellant may claim, there is a wide field for the referee to deal with.\nThe court below might well, if it had seen fit, have defined the proper measure of damages, but how can we say, in face of the judgment of this court in the recent case of Wood v. The Grand Valley Railway Co.[13], that an imperative duty in law rested upon that court to have laid down the limits within which the referee should proceed ?\nThat case presents an entirely different state of facts from this, but the principles of law applicable thereto are closely analogous to if not absolutely identical with those which must govern the referee in proceeding herein.\nIn that case, I felt that the divisional appellate court for Ontario, in order to save needless expenses and avoid the possibility of a miscarriage in the conduct of the reference, might have been well advised in more accurately defining the legal grounds upon which the referee should proceed and the limits of the damages to be allowed.\nUnfortunately I stood alone and must now bow to the decision of the court and say that so long as there is a case of damages to be considered by a referee there is no error in the judgment now appealed from.\nThere is something which might be said relative to the attitude of Johnson in the demands he made upon appellant in its bearing upon this respondent's right to recover. If it had appeared that he, so clearly in his own right or in right of what he was authorized by respondent as assignee, had presented his or her demands, in such clear-cut shape as to absolve appellant from proffering anything but what he did in discharge of his obligation then he was thereby released from further attempts to satisfy the claim.\nThe whole evidence bearing upon such an issue when fairly read does not justify such a contention.\nIndeed, such contention is not pleaded, yet it was only, if resting thereon, that the evidence referred to on the subject could be made to serve the defendant in law.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014The litigation which led to this appeal was instituted by the respondent for the purpose of enforcing a certain agreement, dated November 5th, 1909, between her husband and the appellant, under which certain coal areas in the County of Inverness, N.S., were to be transferred to the appellant in consideration of a present payment of $11,000 and\n$17,000 of the common stock of the Margaree Coal & Railway Company, Limited, said stock to be delivered within six months from the date hereof.\nThe Margaree Company was incorporated in the year 1903-1904, with a nominal capital of \u00a3500,000 and with power to incur indebtedness to the extent of \u00a3600,000. The plan of the promoters was that the company should acquire certain coal areas in Inverness, 48 in number, to develop and work these areas and for that purpose to construct a railway about 50 miles in length connected with the Intercolonial Railway and with shipping points. It was intended that in the usual way the property should be paid for partly in cash and partly by the transfer of fully paid up shares, the necessary capital being procured for the purchase of the areas and for construction and development by sales of bonds and shares.\nThe appellant, who appears to have been the moving spirit in the enterprise, obtained an option from Johnson on his four areas in 1907. Shortly after that the persons interested in the areas, the promoters, pooled their interests, a trustee being appointed and options and transfers in escrow of the leases being given to the trustee. The option on Johnson's areas was extended from time to time until, in 1909, Johnson, being pressed for money, urged the respondent to take over his areas at a cash price and eventually the agreement above mentioned was arrived at. In 1910, before the expiration of the six months within which the shares were to be delivered, under the literal terms of the agreement, Johnson made an assignment for the general benefit of creditors and some months afterwards the assignee with the assent of Johnson's principal creditors transferred Johnson's rights under the agreement to Mrs. Johnson, the respondent, for the consideration of $100. Johnson's estate appears to have been hopelessly involved and it is quite evident, I think, that his rights under the agreement were not regarded by the competent businessmen, who at that time considered the matter, as having any present realizable value. The efforts of the promoters to obtain capital in England and France from time to time appeared to them to be on the point of succeeding and in the summer of 1911 Mr. Morrison, one of the promoters, went to England in the full expectation of succeeding in obtaining the necessary capital; he did not succeed and at the time of the trial the efforts of the appellant and his associates to obtain adequate capital had produced no result.\nIn the meantime Johnson on behalf of his wife had called upon the respondent to perform his agreement by delivering shares, the first demand having been made in the beinning of 1911 about eight months after Johnson's assignment to the trustee for creditors. There were several interviews between Johnson and the respondent and between Johnson and Mr. Morrison on the subject at which Johnson appears to have been informed that shares would be allotted and transferred to him if he insisted upon it. Johnson always, however, assumed the attitude that under the agreement he was entitled to shares in a company furnished with capital for carrying on its operations. There is considerable variety in the form of expression used, but I think according to the fair reading of Johnson's own evidence that is the view of his rights under the agreement which he was putting forward and insisting upon at that time. He says explicitly he would not have accepted shares without being satisfied that the company was properly organized and financed. A correspondence ensued between the appellant and Mr. Allison, the respondent's solicitor, in which a demand was made on behalf of the respondent for payment in money of the amount of the face value of the shares and the action followed.\nThe controversy reduces itself to two questions or rather falls into two divisions. First it is necessary to consider the legal effect of the agreement of the 5th November, 1909. Several views have been put forward. On the part of the respondent it is contended, and the contention seems to have been accepted by the learned Chief Justice in the court below, that the appellant's undertaking was something more than an undertaking that could be satisfied by the delivery of the paid-up shares in the Margaree Company validly allotted and issued. The parties, it is said, did not contemplate the allotment of the shares in the payment of the purchase price of any of the 48 areas, the titles to which had been pooled, until the company had procured the necessary capital to enable it to purchase the areas under the terms of the pooling agreements and to enable it to develop the properties and put the whole undertaking into operation. That is, no doubt, the view though he somewhat crudely expressed it, which Johnson had in his mind when he refused to accept the shares offered by the appellant and that is, no doubt, the view intended to be expressed in the letter of the 31st of July, 1911, written on behalf of the respondent by the gentleman who was then acting as her solicitor.\nOn behalf of the appellant alternative constructions are advanced. First, that if the view just outlined correctly interprets the agreement, that can only be upon the theory that the real nature of the arrangement between Johnson and the appellant was that Johnson in addition to the sum of $11,000 cash was to share in the fruits of the promotion of the company in the ratio of $17,000 to the par value of the aggregate of shares allotted to the proprietors according to the terms of the pooling arrangements. And one result of this is said to be that the obligation to deliver must be subject to a condition that the promotion of the company should be brought to a successful issue. The alternative construction is that the \"$17,000 of the common stock\" of the Margaree Company is a description which is fully answered by shares of the par value of $17,000 validly allotted and fully paid up; but that the agreement being an agreement for the sale of the land the stipulation as to time is not of its essence and that a term should be implied to the effect that delivery of the shares should be exigible only after the lapse of a reasonable time for completing the contemplated purchase by the company of the property of the promoters. There are arguments in favour of every one of these rival constructions of considerable plausibility; but having weighed them all I have not had much difficulty in concluding that on the whole the balance is definitely against the first.\nThere are three circumstances to consider in testing these constructions. First, there was no legal obstacle in the way of allotting fully paid up shares in exchange for the payment in cash of their full value at the time the agreement was entered into or at any time down to the trial; and consequently whether capital was obtained or not, sufficient for the purchase of the properties and the working of the company's enterprise, the agreement was at all times capable of being performed according to its literal terms.\nSecondly, the appellant no doubt as well as Johnson fully expected that the efforts of the promoters to obtain capital would be successful within the period named in the agreement, six months from the date; and this delay, it may be assumed, was intended for the protection of the appellant in order to avoid the embarrassment certain to arise in connection with the issue of the shares and the transfer of them in payment for one of the properties while the promotion of the enterprise remained incomplete.\nThirdly, the sale was brought about by the appellant's desire to accommodate Johnson, who was pressed for money.\nIn these circumstances is there any justification for implying a term, as in the respondent's proposed construction, by which the appellant warranted that sufficient capital would be obtained within the time mentioned or indeed at any time? The principles upon which in transactions of this kind the courts act in implying a term not found expressed in a contract have been stated in various ways. It has been said, for example, that the law will imply a term obviously intended by the parties and necessary to make the contract effectual, that is to say, where the written contract as expressed in writing would otherwise be futile; per Bowen L.J. in Oriental Steamship Co. v. Tylor[14], at page 527. Lord Watson has put the matter thus (and it is perhaps the most practical way of stating it) in Dahl v. Nelson, Donkin & Co.[15], at page 59:\u2014\nI have always understood, that, when the parties to a mercantile contract such as that of affreightment, have not expressed their intentions in a particular event, but have left these to implication, a court of law, in order to ascertain the implied meaning of the contract, must assume that the parties intended to stipulate for that which is fair and reasonable, having regard to their mutual interests and to the main objects of the contract. In some cases that assumption is the only test by which the meaning of the contract can be ascertained. There may be many possibilities within the contemplation of the contract of charterparty which were not actually present to the minds of the parties at the time of making it, and when one or other of these possibilities becomes a fact, the meaning of the contract must be taken to be, not what the parties did intend (for they had neither thought nor intention regarding it), but that which the parties, as fair and reasonable men, would presumably have agreed upon if, having such possibility in view, they had made express provision as to their several rights and liabilities in the event of its occurrence.\nIt is necessary to add, however, a reference to the warning of Lord Esher in Hamlyn & Co. v. Wood & Co.[16] at p. 491; the effect of which is that it is not sufficient that the suggested stipulation should appear to be reasonable or that it should appear to be reasonable to imply such a stipulation; the court must be satisfied that the implication is a necessary one, that is to say, that it must be presumed that both parties, if the matter had been brought to their attention would, as reasonable men, have insisted upon it.\nI am by no means convinced that if the point had been raised Johnson would have insisted upon any warranty, indeed, I think it highly improbable in view of the fact that the appellant was buying Johnson's property at Johnson's solicitation and mainly for Johnson's accommodation, that Johnson would have thought of exacting such a stipulation. He knew that the appellant's interest in the promotion was much greater than his and that no effort would be wanting on the appellant's part; and I see not the slightest ground for inferring that he would have called upon the appellant to warrant by contract the success of his efforts. As to the appellant, there was nothing in the circumstances likely to suggest to any reasonable man in his position (inconveniencing himself to do Johnson a favour) that he ought to undertake the burden of such a stipulation.\nThere is, I think, more plausibility in the contention that both parties to the agreement in question contemplated a transfer to Johnson of shares allotted to the appellant by the company in payment of the purchase price of Johnson's areas in accordance with the terms of the pooling arrangement; a transfer which could only take place when the property as a whole had been taken over by the company. That is what the parties unquestionably had in view. And if the contention on behalf of the respondent, that I have just been examining, were to be accepted it would seem to follow almost as a corollary that the appellant's undertaking to transfer should not be exigible until the property had been taken over by the company. On that footing the case would be well within the settled principle that where from the nature of the contract and surrounding circumstances it is clear that the contract is based upon the assumption by both parties that some condition or state of things going to the root of the contract and essential, to its performance should be in existence, the nonexistence of such condition or state of things when the time for fulfilment has arrived affords in general an answer to an action upon the contract. (Taylor v. Caldwell[17]; Krell v. Henry[18]; Chandler v. Webster[19]; In re Hull and Lady Meux[20]; and cf. Heme Bay Steamboat Co. v. Hutton[21].\nI do not find it necessary to decide definitely whether or not this is the right view of the agreement before us. I have come to the conclusion that whether this view of the agreement or the second of the alternative constructions presented on part of the appellant be accepted, the respondent must fail in her action.\nThe stipulation as to delivery within six months is obviously not of the essence of this contract. Both sides have pressed the contention that the contract contemplates a transfer of shares allotted in payment of coal properties to be taken over by the company. Having regard to the circumstances already adverted to and to the subsequent conduct of the parties which may, I think, be looked to for assistance in interpreting the contract, the proper conclusion is that both parties must have intended that the appellant was to have a reasonable time with reference to the nature of the business he was engaged in before being called upon to deliver the shares and that the parties were contracting upon that footing.\nAccepting this construction of the agreement, then, has there been any breach of which the respondent is entitled to complain? The facts I am about to state are, I think, sufficient to shew that down to the time when, some months prior to the commencement of the action, the respondent through her solicitor demanded money in lieu of shares, there had been no breach on part of the appellant and nothing entitling the respondent to declare that by reason of the appellant's conduct the contract was rescinded.\nThe primary facts are really not in dispute, but it is necessary to notice them at some length in order to consider the legal consequence of them. I have already mentioned that the respondent through her husband had again and again declared that she would not accept shares in the coal company, even although fully paid up until it appeared that sufficient capital had been raised to set the company in operation. That position was reiterated by the respondent's husband in his evidence given at the trial in which he explicitly declared more than once with slight variations of phraseology that he would not have accepted shares until that condition had been satisfied. It is necessary, however, to refer to some communications which passed between Mr. Allison, the respondent's solicitor, and the appellant. In August, 1911, Mr. Allison called upon the appellant and Mr. Morrison and made then, as he says, an unconditional demand upon the appellant for the delivery of the shares which, by a letter of the 27th July, 1911, addressed to the gentleman who was then acting as her solicitor, the appellant had offered her. This demand was not pressed Mr. Allison being informed by the appellant and Mr. Morrison of Mr. Morrison's contemplated visit to Europe and the expectation of both of them that a successful floatation would result. Mr. Allison was informed that the shares would be delivered if he insisted upon it, but that this would be a source of embarrassment; and for this reason the demand was not pressed, the respondent agreeing to await the event of Mr. Morrison's efforts.\nOne is entitled here, I think, to infer (it is not in the least inconsistent with the general effect of Mr. Allison's evidence), that the respondent acted in consenting to wait, with a view to her own rather obvious interest that the prospects of a successful floatation should not be impaired as the result of her importunities. The respondent did not move again until the 19th of February, 1912, when a letter was written by Mr. Allison demanding not the shares but the face value of the shares in money. This letter was followed by a letter of the 29th of February in which the respondent explicitly refused to accept shares and reiterated her demand to be paid the face value of the shares as damages. The conclusion to which I have come is that after the interview of August, 1911, considering all the circumstances, the respondent was not entitled without some further intimation to the appellant to treat a failure to deliver upon some particular date as a breach of contract on part of the appellant entitling her to treat the contract as rescinded; and in any view the attitude assumed by the respondent in the letters of the 19th February, 29th February, 2nd of March and 8th of June and at the trial absolves the appellant from anything like a formal tender of the shares or the production of the shares in court\nThe appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J. (dissenting).\u2014This action is brought upon the following agreement: (see pages 19 et seq., ante).\nThe coal areas covered by this agreement were, immediately upon its execution, conveyed by W. EL Johnson to the defendant, and the $11,000 cash was thereupon paid to Johnson. The shares have not been delivered. The floatation of the Margaree Coal Company has not yet been effected, difficulties hitherto insurmountable having been encountered in making the financial arrangements deemed necessary, and at the present time there appears to be no prospect of a successful floatation of the \"'company. The plaintiff, who is the wife of W. H. Johnson, purchased from his assignee for creditors his interests under the agreement with the defendant.\nAfter several extensions of the time for delivery of the shares had been assented to, the plaintiff finally called upon the defendant to carry out his agreement; and she brings this action for damages for his failure to make delivery of the $17,000 of shares.\nIn order to determine the rights of the parties it is essential to ascertain what their bargain was. Two questions arise as to the meaning and effect of the writing to which they committed it. The first question is: What kind of shares did W. H. Johnson stipulate for and William Roche undertake to deliver\u2014shares in a company merely chartered, without capital or property, and with no prospect of being in a position to commence operations within any reasonable time, or shares in an organized company with sufficient capital provided for the development and prosecution of its undertaking and having its operations already begun, or being in a position immediately, or practically so, to commence operations? The second question is: When was delivery of the shares made exigible\u2014at, or within a reasonable time after, the expiry of the six months named in the writing, or only if and when the defendant and his associates should succeed in financing the company and putting it in a position to commence active operations?\nBy the judgment at the trial it was determined that the shares contracted for were shares in a company \"on its feet\"\u2014adequately financed and ready to prosecute its undertaking\u2014that the defendant had contracted to deliver such shares not if and when floatation should take place, but within six months or a reasonable time thereafter, and that there had been a breach of this contract by the defendant entitling the plaintiff to damages. But because he deemed the evidence insufficient to enable him to assess such damages the learned trial judge held that the plaintiff could recover only nominal damages. On appeal by the plaintiff the full court held him entitled to substantial damages, indicated the basis on which they should be assessed and directed a reference to fix the amount. From that judgment the defendant appeals. In order to know what the parties intended respectively to stipulate for and to undertake, all the terms of the writing, the circumstances under which they contracted and the interpretation which their conduct shews that they themselves put upon their agreement must be taken into account.\nThe plaintiff alleges that the intention of the parties was that her husband should receive shares in a company sufficiently financed to be ready to begin active operations and that the defendant undertook to deliver such shares to him within six months. By his plea the defendant asserts that delivery of the shares was to be made only upon completion of the financial arrangements of the company and when it should be ready to begin operations and alternatively that if the plaintiff was entitled to the delivery of any shares before the completion of financial arrangements and before the company was ready to commence operations, her only right was to receive shares issued under section 10 of the incorporating statute that she refused to take such shares when offered to her, but that he is still ready and willing to bring them into court; and he submits to such order as the court may see fit to make in respect to them.\nThe evidence seems to establish that the plaintiff and her husband were more than once informed that they could have shares of the kind last mentioned. They always took the position that they would not accept such shares as they were not what they were entitled to. If shares in a company possessed neither of the money nor of the property requisite for its enterprise were what the plaintiff's husband had agreed to take, the defendant might properly ask that this action should be dismissed upon his carrying out the offer of delivery made in his statement of defence. When the plaintiff and her husband refused to accept such shares, however, the defendant did not take the stand that they were not entitled to anything else. On the contrary he urged that they should allow further time for the financing in order that shares in a company ready to operate might be available. There was more than one extension of the time for delivery agreed to under these circumstances.\nBut the terms of the contract themselves perhaps furnish an argument even more cogent in Support of the view that the parties were bargaining for shares in a company adequately financed and ready to prosecute its undertaking. Else why the stipulation for six months within which to make delivery ? Shares such as had been offered to the plaintiff and her husband more than once before action, and of which the offer is repeated in the defendant's plea, were immediately available when the agreement was made. There would be no reason for providing that their delivery should be withheld for six months. Shares answering the other description were not immediately available, but it was understood that the financial arrangements of the company were about complete and that it would undoubtedly be in operation well within the six months stipulated for. Indeed, so great was the expectation of an almost immediate floatation of the company's bonds and stocks, that the plaintiff's husband understood (as the trial judge has found), though erroneously, that the stock of the company had been actually underwritten. The learned Judge says:\u2014\nThere is an issue of fact between Mr. Johnson on the one side, and the defendant and Mr. Morrison and the other side. Mr. Johnson says that Mr. Morrison and the defendant, both being present at the same time, told him that the stock in the company had been actually underwritten, this is denied by the defendant and Mr. Morrison, and I accept their testimony. I do not impute intentional untruthfulness to Mr. Johnson, and I have no doubt that words of strong expectation were used, which, after the lapse of time, Mr. Johnson may now think were representations of an actual existing state of affairs.\nTo quote another passage from the opinion of the learned judge:\u2014\nAt the time when the contract was made, the defendant, I have no doubt, expected that before the six months elapsed, money would be raised in England to float the company, in which event the company would have been organized and the stock issued and delivered. This, I have no doubt, was what the defendant thought and intended to do.\nThere is abundant evidence to support these findings and I can see no reason why they should he disturbed.\nAs already stated the first position taken by the defendant himself is that his obligation was to deliver the shares only after the floatation of the company\u2014that, as it is put in his factum,\nthe period of six months mentioned in the agreement * * * had reference merely to the probable time necessary to finance the company and were words of expectation only.\nAs to the soundness of this interpretation of the agreement I shall have something to say presently. I refer to it now because it makes it practically certain that it was shares in a company completely floated and ready to prosecute its undertaking\u2014a fact otherwise tolerably, well established\u2014that the parties had in view. The suggestion that the defendant's obligation could be satisfied by the delivery of shares in a company without indispensable capital paid, or even subscribed, and with no prospect of attaining a position in which it would be ready to commence operations, issued under such a provision as section 10 of the \"Incorporating Act,\" was the veriest afterthought.\nBut what as to the obligation to deliver within six months, which I regard as the really crucial question in the case ? In the first place without distortion of plain language an unqualified undertaking to deliver shares within six months cannot be read as providing for delivery only when the company should be floated and as relieving from all obligation to deliver if floatation should be found impossible. An analysis of the exhaustive argument for the appellant on this branch of the case discloses that it rests wholly and solely upon the unlikelihood of the appellant having bound himself absolutely to make delivery. But if he meant that his obligation should be contingent on floatation how easy it would have been to express that idea! Why stipulate for six months? No doubt, in the light of subsequent events, it may seem astonishing that the defendant should not have anticipated the possibility of difficulties in the financing of his company. But the evidence makes it abundantly clear that at the time the agreement was made the expectation of everybody\u2014of the defendant and his friends and advisers as well as of the plaintiff's husband\u2014was that the floatation was already for all practical purposes, an accomplished fact, and that in undertaking to make delivery within six months the defendant was in reality not assuming any risk. It was in this frame of mind that he made his bargain. Why should we now import into it an element of contingency for which he did not provide and against which, had it been suggested to him at that time, he would probably have deemed it an excess of caution to guard? Moreover, having regard to Johnson's attitude\u2014his refusal to renew options, his insistence on an out and out purchase of his areas, his determination to secure in some satisfactory form his price of $28,000\u2014what justification is there for assuming that he was prepared to take, and did in fact take, the risk of failure of a floatation which was wholly in the hands of the defendant and his associates? No doubt under pressure of straitened circumstances he reduced his cash payment from $14,000 to $11,000, increasing the stock payment for $14,000 to $17,000\u2014but on doing so he obtained from a man known to be in a financial position which made him capable of implementing it, an unconditional promise for the delivery of $17,000 of shares in a company which I. think it has been conclusively shewn was to be a company financed and floated upon the basis which all parties then had in mind and regarded as practically an accomplished fact. With great respect for those who hold the contrary view, I cannot, because of any supposed hardship on the defendant\u2014which I cannot but think is more apparent than real (for after all, be obtained the coal areas which we must assume he thought worth $28,000, or he would not as a promoter of the Margaree Coal Company have made the bargain he did)\u2014introduce into that bargain a condition to which the parties did not make it subject and to which upon the whole evidence I see no reason to think they intended that it should be subject. Hamlyn & Co. v. Wood & Co.[22], at pages 491, 494-5.\nI agree with the learned trial judge and the learned judges of the appellate court that the arrangement made with Mr. Thorn was not, and was not intended to be, a discharge of the defendant's contractual obligation.\nThe defendant further complains of the judgment in appeal because it allows the plaintiff on a reference to supplement evidence as to damages which the trial judge found to be insufficient to warrant a recovery of more than nominal damages. It is only upon this point, as I understand their judgment, that there was any difference of opinion amongst the judges of the provincial courts. There was, in my opinion, evidence which shewed that the plaintiff was entitled to recover substantial damages, though probably not all that might be furnished to enable the court to satisfactorily fix the amount which should be awarded. The attainment of precision or certainty in the ascertainment of the amount of actual loss is not essential to the assessment of damages in cases such as this. Chaplin v. Hicks[23]. I am fully alive to the danger of allowing a plaintiff to supplement his proof either upon a new trial or on a reference such as the court en banc has directed. But there can be no doubt of the power of, the court in a proper case to make such an order. The exercise of that power is necessarily from its very nature largely discretionary and should not be lightly interfered with on a further appeal. The question to be determined in the present action is: What would have been the probable value of shares in the common stock of the defendant company had it been successfully floated within six months of the making of the agreement or within any extension of that time assented to by the plaintiff? On such a question there is perhaps not the same danger in allowing further investigation as ordinarily attends the ordering of re-hearings on questions of fact. Moreover, I am not satisfied that all the aspects in which the question of damages should be considered in a case such as this were present to the mind of the learned trial judge. Many elements which must be considered in estimating what would have been the probable value of the shares have been suggested in the judgment of the present learned Chief Justice of Nova Scotia. For the view that, in a case in which the damages are difficult of ascertainment and largely of a contingent character and the evidence adduced at the trial, where the question of damages was gone into, shews that substantial damages have been sustained, but is insufficient to enable the court to determine the amount which should be awarded, it is not an improper exercise of discretion to direct a reference such as has been ordered in the present case, there is the authority of the recent decision of the Ontario Appellate Division in Wood v. Grand Valley Railway Co.[24], affirmed on appeal by this court[25].\nI am for these reasons of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal, allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J.

Owing to mistakes in transmission of the money through the mails, the payment was not made until after the date mentioned in the letter, when, as the property had been sold to the plaintiff in the meantime, the money forwarded in payment was refused and returned to Mignault. Sometime prior to the expiration of the time for redemption, Mignault had made a donation of the lands in question to Octave Gagnon, one of the defendants, and granted a right of passage over the lands to the other defendant. The plaintiff, having registered the deed conveying the lands to him, brought action, au p\u00e9titoire, to recover the lands against Mignault and the two other defendants, now appellants. Mignault, appearing separately, filed a defence to the action offering to pay the amount due on the loan but did not do so nor deposit the money in court and, finally, he suffered judgment to be rendered against him ex parte. The other defendants filed a joint defence to the action and brought the amount due into, court, asking for special relief in the circumstances.\nBelcourt K.C. and Chewier appeared for the appellants.\nA. Lemieux K.C. and Arthur B\u00e9langer for the respondent. The Chief Justice.\u2014In this case the plaintiff, now respondent, claims to be the owner of a lot of land in possession of the defendant Mignault who is not a party to this appeal. The questions to be determined are:\n(a) Whether the transactions which passed between the plaintiff's auteur, Dame Marthe Bourgard, and her agent Turcotte on the one hand, and the defendant Mignault on the other, are such as to prevent plaintiff from asserting his title as owner to the land;\n(b) Whether by reason of the course of the proceedings in the courts below the present appellants are precluded from asserting their claim to what, in a legal system different from that which prevails in the Province of Quebec, would be called equitable relief.\nI state the questions thus broadly so as to include a new and interesting point raised by Mr. Justice Brodeur and which apparently did not occur to any of the caunsel in the case. It is not referred to in the factums, was not mentioned at the argument here and passed unnoticed in both courts below. Assuming that it is properly before us, I will endeavour to deal with this new point when in the examination of the evidence I reach the letter out of which it arises.\nThe issues raised by the pleadings and decided in both courts below offer very little difficulty. We are all, I believe, agreed that, by reason of Mignault's failure to exercise his right of redemption within the stipulated period, the title to the land vested in Miss Bourgard.\nThe only real difficulty arises out of the letter subsequently, written by Notary Turcotte to Mignault, To appreciate the bearing of that letter it will be necessary to consider all the facts as they appear on the record. On the 9th October, 1908, by deed passed before Turcotte N.P., the defendant Mignault sold to Dame Marthe Bourgard a plot of land described as lot No. 49 B., 6th range of the cadastre of the Township of Normandin. The sale was made subject to a right of redemption exercisable within five years and purports to convey \"tous les droits, int\u00e9r\u00eats, titres et pretentions et ameliorations\" that the vendor had in the lot described. All payments under the deed were to be made at the domicile of the purchaser at St. Michel de Bellechasse, many miles distant from the residence of the vendor who remained in possession of the property sold, and for the convenience of both parties it was agreed that the notary would be authorized to receive all the payments which the deed called for. The right of redemption was not exercised within the delay, which expired Oct. 9th, 1913, and, thereupon, Miss Bourgard remained absolute owner of the property (article 1550 C.C.). We are all, I understand, agreed that the stipulated term in a deed like the one under consideration must be strictly observed and that it is not within the power of the court to extend it. (Articles 1549 and 2248 C.C.).\nOn the 8th November, 1913, Turcotte wrote Mignault to say that his client wanted her money and that, if not paid before the twentieth of that month, she would be obliged to sell her interest in the property. Not having received an answer to this letter, Miss Bourgard on the 11th December, 1913, sold the property to the plaintiff, respondent, who brought this petitory action in April, 1914, against Mignault and the two appellants, Octave and Abel Gagnon. The latter were brought into the case as donees of the property by deed from Mignault passed Sept. 4th, 1911. Mignault appeared in the action separately, moved for particulars as to the circumstances under which the property was acquired by the plaintiff\u2014and then gave notice of his intention to refund the amount received by him when the sale \"\u00e0 r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9\" was made with interest and costs (sauf \u00e0 parfaire). This notice was filed on the 6th June, 1914. Apparently the offer was not acted upon; no money was tendered or deposited in court. On the 12th June, 1914, the case, on the issue with Mignault, was inscribed for proof and hearing on the merits ex parte. And judgment was rendered declaring that Mignault had forfeited his right to re-purchase and that plaintiff was absolute owner of the property. From that judgment there has been no appeal. Much importance was attached, I think rightly, in both courts below to that judgment in its bearing upon the issue with the appellants.\nIn November, 1914, the appellants filed their joint plea alleging that the \"vente \u00e0 r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9\" was merely a disguised loan, that the property was really worth over $1,100 and that within the stipulated period (13th November, 1913), the amount due in capital and interest was sent by registered mail to Turcotte who in the interval had removed from St. Cyrille de Normandin to Quebec, but being improperly addressed the letter did not reach its destination and was returned, after December 20th, 1913, by the post office authorities to the sender, Mignault, who again forwarded the money to Turcotte at his right address; that the latter improperly refused to accept the money on the ground that the delay had expired; and the defendants, Gagnon, brought the amount due into court with their pleadings.\nOn these issues the parties went to trial, and the facts as alleged were either admitted or proved by oral and documentary evidence. The trial judge maintained the action on the ground that the right of redemption not having been exercised within the stipulated delay the deed of sale to Miss Bourgard became absolute, and, consequently, the deed of donation by Mignault to appellants was without effect. He also held that the ex parte judgment against Mignault was a complete bar to any rights which the appellants might have acquired under the deed. This judgment was confirmed on appeal to the Court of Review.\nThis is undoubtedly a hard case. The property is apparently worth more than the amount paid for it and the evident intention of the parties was that the title in the property should return to the seller when he had paid his debt. The position is made more difficult by the bona fide attempt of Mignault to honestly fulfil his obligations frustrated by the unfortunate mistake made by the postmaster in addressing his letter to Turcotte, a mistake which is easily understood when we take into account the illiteracy and lack of familiarity with affairs of men in their position. Mignault, however, when notified by the notary that his second letter arrived too late, took no steps to assert his rights alleging the circumstances under which he had failed to meet his obligations. Had he done so, it is conceivable that, notwithstanding the very stringent provisions of the Code, some measure of relief might have been given him. But, as the judges below point out, he remained silent until towards the end of April, 1914, when the respondent brought this suit and then he was content to serve the notice to which I referred without giving effect to his alleged intention to refund the purchase price and he did not bring the money into court. He allowed judgment ordering him to give up the property to go against him ex parte and no attempt has been made to have that judgment set aside. It is therefore chose jug\u00e9e as to him. The appellants are in no better position than Mignault. By their deed of donation, made subsequent to the sale to Miss Bourgard, they acquired Mignault's rights, such as they were at that time, and they could in law acquire nothing more (Sirois v. Carrier[1]; Levasseur v. Pelletier[2]; M\u00e9nard v. Guibord[3]). When the delay expired Mignault lost his rights and appellants' title derived from Mignault must have the same fate.\nIn these circumstances I agree entirely in the conclusion reached by the judges of both courts below. It is impossible to give appellants any relief. Upon its true construction the deed by Mignault to Bourgard must be held to operate as an absolute sale to which was attached a conditional right of re-purchase to be exercised within a fixed delay which, as I have already said, the court has no power to extend (Shaw v. Jeffery[4]).\nLaurent with his usual lucidity of thought and expression says:\nDans notre droit moderne les juges ne peuvent d\u00e9roger aux conventions des parties; c'est une loi pour eux comme pour les contractants.\nThe whole subject is discussed in Salvas v. Vassal[5], approved of in Queen v. Montminy[6], at page 490.\nHere Mr. Justice Brodeur raises, as I have already said, an interesting and difficult question as to the effect of the letter written by Turcotte on the 13th November, 1913, which reads as follows: Monsieur Romuald Mignault, Cultivateur,\nNormandin,\nCher Monsieur:\u2014\nEn arrivant de Normandin, j'ai trouv\u00e9 ici une lettre de la personne qui vous a pr\u00eat\u00e9 les $300 par mon entremise, qui m'informe qu'elle a absolument besoin de son argent. Si vous ne pouvez pas le lui rembourser, elle sera forc\u00e9e de vendre ses droits.\nOr comme vous le savez, c'est un acte \u00e0 r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 que vous avez, et il serait fort emb\u00eatant pour vous que cel\u00e0 tomberait \u00e0 des personnes qui aimeraient \u00e0 faire de la mis\u00e8re, car le tout est d\u00fb depuis le 20 octobre dernier.\nJ'esp\u00e9rais pouvoir vous rencontrer \u00e0 mon voyage \u00e0 Normandin, mais je n'ai pu vous voir. On m'a dit que vous n'\u00e9tiez pas \u00e0 l'\u00e9glise, quand je me suis inform\u00e9 de vous.\nDans tous les cas, je compte que vous y verrez d'hui \u00e0 une dizaine de jours, car pass\u00e9 le vingt novembre ce sera trop tard.\nVotre bien d\u00e9vou\u00e9,\nJ.S.N. Turcotte.\nAt the date of this letter Mignault was in default and Miss Bourgard was the indisputable owner of the property. She was free to do with it as she chose. This letter must be read with the following admission made by the parties at the trial:\nLes parties admettent que le notaire Turcotte qui a agi comme notaire sur la vente \u00e0 r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 consentie par le d\u00e9fendeur Mignault en faveur de Mademoiselle Bourgard \u00e9tait autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 donner un d\u00e9lai jusqu'au vingt (20) de novembre mil neuf cent treize (1913), pour retraire la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 recevoir l'argent pour Mademoiselle Beauregard, et que l'autorisation pour prolonger le d\u00e9lai \u00e9tait donn\u00e9 par Mademoiselle Beauregard.\nTaken together, it seems to me the letter and the admission evidence an intention on the part of Miss Bourgard not to insist upon enforcing her strict rights under the deed of sale if the vendor would pay the amount of the purchase price of the property on or before the 20th November, 1913, or, in other words, the purchaser agrees to extend until that date the period within which the right of redemption may be exercised by the vendor. That is the construction put upon the letter at the time by both parties. Mignault says when examined as a witness, that immediately on its receipt he went to the bank, drew out his money and sent the amount he owed by post-office order to Turcotte.\nIn their plea to the action of revendication of the property, the present appellants say\nQue le ou vers le 8 novembre 1913, le notaire Turcotte, agent de Delie. Bourgard, avertit le d\u00e9fendeur Mignault que le d\u00e9lai pour le r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e9tait prolong\u00e9 jusqu'au vingt novembre, 1913.\nIn the suit as brought the plaintiff's demand is in revendication of the property and Mignault, to whom Turcotte's letter is addressed, declares his intention to refund the money but without giving effect to his good intention. He does not invoke the letter or allege that he acquired under it any rights to the property or that it in any way changed the position except with respect to the delay within which he might exercise his right of redemption; My brother Brodeur refers to Troplong, Vente, (at page 220, post,) where it is said that the legal effect of such a letter would be equivalent to a promise of sale of the property to Mignault. The same opinion is expressed by other writers collected in Guillouard, \"Trait\u00e9 de la Vente,\" Vol. 2, pp. 190 and 191, art. 654. It will be found, however, on reference to the text writers that they are not in accord. I would draw special attention to this very significant sentence in Beaudry \"Vente,\" No. 1636, p. 541:\nDu moins la prolongation conventionnelle du terme ne pourrait porter aucune atteinte aux droits des tiers qui auraient acquis de l'acheteur.\nIt would seem that all the authors are preoccupied with the fear that the rights acquired by third parties in the interval between the expiration of the stipulated term and the date of the document granting the extension may be prejudiced. But assuming that Troplong's theory is accepted and that at the expiration of the period there can be no extension of the right of redemption, and that the new agreement is to be considered as equivalent to a promise of sale, I cannot, even in that view, see how it is possible to give the appellants any relief for two reasons which seem to me unanswerable.\nAt the time the letter in question was written the stipulated delay had expired and Miss Bourgard had become absolute owner of the property and, as a necessary consequence, any rights acquired by the appellants under the deed of donation from Mignault lapsed. The most that can be said is that the letter operated as a promise to sell the property to Mignault on condition that he should take advantage of the offer before November 20th, 1913, which he failed to do (Pothier, \"Vente,\" No. 480; Vide Fournier J in Grange v. McLennan[7], at pages 393 et seq., referring to Dorion C.J. in the court below. Refer also to Troplong, at page 394). Further, when this suit was brought, instead of taking advantage of the new opportunity afforded him to redeem his property or to assert his right under the presumed promise of sale, Mignault was content to give the notice above referred to and allowed judgment to go against him by default. This judgment, as held by the Court of Review, disposes of any right Mignault had in the property, and, as I have already said, appellants' title is derived from, and is dependent on, that of their auteur Mignault.\nThe second objection which, as at present advised, seems to me absolutely unanswerable, is that the respondent having bought the property from Miss Bourgard who was, at the time, absolute owner, his registered title cannot be affected by the unregistered promise of sale given to Mignault. There is nothing in the evidence to shew\u2014and it is not suggested\u2014that respondent had any knowledge of the Turcotte letter.\nI have gone into this at some length because this, undoubtedly is a very hard case and hard cases have a tendency to make bad law. Our duty, of course, is to do justice, but \"according to law.\"\nI am disposed also to think that this new point should not be considered now. The attention of counsel has not been directed to it and we are not, on this record, in a position to do justice to all the parties and to the courts below. Vide The \"Tasmania\"[8], per Lord Herschell at page 225; Browne v.\" Dunn[9]; Dufresne v. Desforges[10]; Connecticut Fire Ins. Co. v. Kavanagh[11]; Cleveland v. Chanbliss[12].\nAnother question was raised on this appeal which does not seem to have been brought to the attention of the courts below although I find it mentioned in the factums in Review.\nIt is said, as far as I can understand the facts, that the lot of land could not be sold by Mignault without the consent of his wife.\nIn fact, there is nothing to shew that in October, 1908, Mignault was married. He does say, when examined as a witness (in 1914), that he was married for a second time, and it also appears in the deeds to appellants that he was married in 1911, but this record is silent as to his status in 1908.\nFurther it is impossible for me to understand this point by reference to 6 Edw. VII., eh. 21, section 1. (Que.) That section reads:\n1. Article 1744 of the Revised Statutes, as enacted by the Act 60 Victoria, chapter 27, section 1, is amended by adding thereto the following clause:\nThe owner of the homestead may, however, under the same conditions and upon observing the same formalities as for its alienation, hypothecate it and thereby render it subject to seizure and sale.\nThen 60 Vict., chap. 27, section 1, reads as follows:\n1. Articles 1743, 1744 and 1745 of the Revised Statutes are replaced by the following:\n1743.\u2014No public lands, granted to a bon\u00e2 fide settler by instruments in the form of location tickets, licenses of occupation, or certificates of sale or other titles of a similar nature or to the same effect, in virtue of chapter sixth of title fourth of these Revised Statutes, respecting the Department of Crown Lands and the matters connected therewith, and according to the orders-in-council and regulations passed in virtue of the said chapter, shall, so long as letters-patent are not issued therefor, be pledged or hypothecated by judgment or otherwise, or be liable to seizure or execution for any debt whatsoever, except for the price of such lands, nor can the buildings, constructions and improvements thereon, including the mills which the settler makes use of for his own proper service, notwithstanding articles 1980 and 1981 of the Civil Code, and articles 553 and 554 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\n1744.\u2014Every settler upon public lands in the province, who has received letters-patent for such land, shall hold such land, provided it does not exceed 200 acres in extent, and if it does so, then 200 acres thereof, together with the buildings, constructions and improvements thereon, including the mills employed of by such settler for his own use as a \"homestead.\"\nNo such homestead shall, during the life of the original grantee, of his widow and of his, her or their children and descendants, in the direct line, be liable to be seized and sold for any debt whatsoever.\nThe proprietor of a homestead may alienate the same either by gratuitous or onerous title.\nHowever, if married, the notarial consent of his consort is required, and, if the latter is dead, and the proprietor has minor children, the consent of a family council, homologated by the Superior Court of the district in which the homestead is situated, or by a judge of that Court.\nBut the statute of 9 Edward VII., chap. 30, section 5, provides:\nNo acts or transactions made and entered into in virtue of articles 1743 and 1744 of the Revised Statutes as contained in the Act 60 Victoria, chapter 27, section 1, amended by the Act 6 Edward VII., chapter 21; section 1, shall be deemed to have been invalidated by this Act.\nThe proprietor of a homestead and of public lands in virtue of articles 1743 and 1744 of the Revised Statutes, has the right, and is declared to have always had the right to alienate by gratuitous or by onerous title, even without the consent of his consort expressed in a notarial deed.\nThis Act shall not affect pending cases which may have been taken before the coming into force thereof.\nAlthough it does appear that the lot in question was acquired from the Crown under location ticket there is nothing to shew that the patent had not issued previous to the date of the sale to Miss Bourgard. On the contrary, all the presumptions arising from the recitals in the deeds of donation point to the title having issued before 1908.\nI am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDavies J.\u2014With great reluctance because of the extreme hardship to the appellant under the facts as proved of maintaining the judgment appealed from, I feel myself obliged under the law as it stands in the Province of Quebec to concur in dismissing this appeal.\nIdington J.\u2014I regret to find that this is one of those cases in which the law does not enable the court to execute justice and hence that this appeal must be dismissed.\nDuff J.\u2014Not having heard the whole of the argument I take no part in the judgment. Anglin J.\u2014But for the letter of Notary Turcotte, written on the 8th November, 1913, giving the appellants until the 20th November, 1913, to pay the sum of $300 and interest, it would appear that their rights had become extinguished and the title under which the respondents hold absolute on the 20th October, 1913. Arts. 1549, 1550 and 2248 C.C. That letter probably did not effect a prolongation of the right of redemption (droit de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9) but operated only as a unilateral promise of re-sale (7 Mignault, 159). If, however, the letter could be regarded as having extended the right of redemption, the extended right would be of the same nature and subject to the same conditions, and, the money not having been paid, it would have expired on the 20th November, 1913, with the like consequences. If, on the other hand, the letter merely amounts to a promise of re-sale, that lapsed on non-payment of the price within the delay stipulated. Tach\u00e9 v. Stanton[13]; Marcoux v. Nolan[14]; Munro v. Dufresne[15]; Foster v. Fraser[16]; Cujas, 25 Dig.; Pothier, \"Vente,\" No. 63.\nBrodeur J.\u2014Le 20 octobre, 1908, Romuald Mignault vendait avec facult\u00e9 de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 Mlle. Beauregard l'immeuble en question en cette cause moyennant une somme de trois cents piastres ($300).\nLa facult\u00e9 de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 devait \u00eatre exerc\u00e9e le ou avant le 20 octobre, 1913, en remettant \u00e0 l'acheteur la somme de trois cents piastres ($300), plus l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de 6% par an. Il \u00e9tait convenu que pendant ce laps de temps Mignault demeurerait en possession de l'immeuble, qu'il l\u2019entretiendrait en bon \u00e9tat de r\u00e9parations locatives, qu'il paierait les taxes municipales et scolaires et, en plus, l'int\u00e9r\u00eat sur la somme de $300.\nCette vente fut enregistr\u00e9e au bureau d'enregistrement du comt\u00e9.\nLe 4 septembre, 1911, Mignault a donn\u00e9 entr'autres la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en question \u00e0 son beau-fils, Octave Gagnon, l'un des appelants dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, avec obligation de garder, nourrir, v\u00eatir le donateur et son \u00e9pouse pendant leur vie ou bien de leur payer une rente annuelle de $100 par ann\u00e9e et de payer leurs dettes hypoth\u00e9caires et autres affectant la dite propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nIl est bien \u00e9vident que la somme de trois cents piastres pay\u00e9e par Mlle. Beauregard ne repr\u00e9sentait pas la valeur de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et que dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat des parties on aurait eu recours \u00e0 la vente avec facult\u00e9 de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 afin de pouvoir garantir davantage le remboursement de la somme que Mlle. Beauregard pr\u00eatait \u00e0 Mignault.\nLe contrat comportait que les paiements du capital et de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat devaient se faire au domicile de l'acheteur \u00e0 r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9. Les parties ne demeurent pas dans la m\u00eame r\u00e9gion. Une distance d'environ 200 milles les s\u00e9pare. Et alors il est admis que le notaire qui avait pass\u00e9 le contrat et qui demeurait pr\u00e8s du vendeur pourrait recevoir l'argent. Le contrat a donc \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9 \u00e0 ce sujet. Plus tard, le notaire a laiss\u00e9 le Lac St. Jean pour venir demeurer \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec.\nLe 20 octobre, 1913, date fix\u00e9e par la convention pour l'exercice de la facult\u00e9 de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9, le remboursement du capital pr\u00eat\u00e9 ne se fit pas et alors, en vertu de l'article 1550 C.C., Mlle. Beauregard demeura propri\u00e9taire irr\u00e9vocable de la chose vendue.\nLe 8 novembre, 1913, M. Turcotte, le notaire de Mlle. Beauregard, \u00e9crivait \u00e0 M. Mignault, lui demandant le remboursement de la somme de $300 et il ajoutait que, s'il ne pouvait pas payer avant le 20 novembre, sa cliente serait forc\u00e9e de vendre ses droits.\nLe 13 novembre, M. Mignault acheta au bureau de poste un mandat pour la somme qui \u00e9tait due en capital et int\u00e9r\u00eats, et l'envoya au notaire Turcotte, \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec, \u00e0 qui les paiements d'int\u00e9r\u00eats avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 faits ant\u00e9rieurement, seulement, au lieu d'adresser la lettre \u00e0 la rue H\u00e9bert, qui lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 indiqu\u00e9e, il l'adressa \u00e0 la rue Albert, et la lettre, apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 diff\u00e9rents bureaux de poste n'est revenu \u00e0 l'envoyeur que le 20 de d\u00e9cembre.\nIl r\u00e9-exp\u00e9dia de suite le mandat au notaire Turcotte mais dans l'intervalle Mlle. Beauregard avait vendu ses droits \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 en la pr\u00e9sente cause, Nicolas B\u00e9langer, le 11 d\u00e9cembre, 1913, et le notaire a alors renvoy\u00e9 l'argent \u00e0 Mignault.\nB\u00e9langer poursuit maintenant, au p\u00e9titoire, Mignault et Octave Gagnon et il dirige aussi sa poursuite contre Abel Gagnon parce que Mignault lui avait donn\u00e9 un droit de passage sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nLes appelants soumettent que le contrat entre les parties \u00e9tait \u00e9videmment un contrat de pr\u00eat et non pas un contrat de vente.\nIl est vrai que les parties sont entr\u00e9es en n\u00e9gociations pour un emprunt; mais comme les garanties qui \u00e9taient offertes par M. Mignault n'\u00e9taient pas suffisantes, je suppose, pour garantir le pr\u00eat, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 convenu qu'on aurait recours \u00e0 une vente avec facult\u00e9 de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 afin de pouvoir rendre certain le remboursement du pr\u00eat. Les parties ont accept\u00e9 cette m\u00e9thode de contrat et nous ne pouvons pas intervenir pour changer leurs conventions faites \u00e9videmment avec d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration.\nDans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, le r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 n'est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement stipul\u00e9 que pour donner une garantie plus sure au cr\u00e9ancier qui a pr\u00eat\u00e9 son argent et qui ne veut pas courir le risque d'en perdre une partie en faisant les frais n\u00e9cessaires pour vendre l'immeuble en justice. Ce contrat est l\u00e9gal lors m\u00eame que le prix de la vente serait bien inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 la valeur de l'immeuble, car l'annulation d'un contrat pour l\u00e9sion d'outre moiti\u00e9 n'existe plus. Salvas v. Vassal[17].\nIl est incontestable que le demandeur, intim\u00e9, fait preuve d'un sens moral plus ou moins facile en refusant d'accepter l'argent qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 offert avec ses frais de justice et en insistant pour garder une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 repr\u00e9sentant une bien plus grande valeur que la somme qu'il a d\u00e9bours\u00e9e. Il est \u00e0 esp\u00e9rer que sa conscience lui indiquera un jour la fausset\u00e9 de sa conduite et l'incitera \u00e0 r\u00e9parer le tort et le dommage qu'il cause aux appelants.\nJ'avais cru au cours du d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 que l'opinion exprim\u00e9e par Troplong et autres auteurs sur la nature de la nouvelle convention qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite entre les parties par la lettre du notaire Turcotte du 8 novembre, 1913, pourrait nous permettre de maintenir l'appel. Mais cette nouvelle convention, suivant l'opinion de ces auteurs, ne pourrait tout au plus \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e que comme une promesse de vente. Mlle. Beauregard qui serait devenue propri\u00e9taire irr\u00e9vocable, vu le non-exercice de la facult\u00e9 de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9, aurait alors par la lettre de son notaire Turcotte promis de vendre l'immeuble en question jusqu'au 20 novembre, 1913. C'\u00e9tait alors au promettant acheteur d'offrir le paiement du prix de cette promesse de vente dans les d\u00e9lais stipul\u00e9s. Il ne l'a pas fait, ou plut\u00f4t le mandat-poste qu'il a envoy\u00e9 ici ne s'est pas rendu. Munro v. Dufresne[18] ; Foster v. Fraser[19]; Dechamps v.

Co. crossed those of the C. P. Ry. Co. at rail level. On report of its chief engineer that this crossing was dangerous the Board, of its own motion, ordered that the street be carried under the C. P. Ry. tracks. This change of grade relieved the Toronto Ry. Co. from the expense of maintaining an interlocking plant and benefitted it otherwise.\nHeld, that the order was made for the protection, safety and convenience of the public; that the Toronto Ry.

APPEAL from an order of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada on certain questions of law, by leave of the Board, and on a question of jurisdiction, by leave of the Chief Justice of Canada.\nThe following are the questions so submitted to the Supreme Court of Canada for decision:\u2014\n\"1. That the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada had no jurisdiction to order the Toronto Railway Company to contribute to the cost of the construction of the subway at Avenue Road.\n\"2. That by reason of the terms of the agreement between the Toronto Railway Company and the City of Toronto, dated the 1st day of September, 1891, and confirmed by 55 Vict., chap. 99, the Toronto Railway Company should not have been ordered to contribute to the cost of the said subway.\n\"3. By reason of the agreement between the Toronto Railway Company and the City of Toronto, dated the 1st day of September, 1891, and the Act of the legislature confirming the same, that the said Toronto Railway Company is entitled to the use of the said street in the exercise of its franchise. And because the City of Toronto and the Canadian Pacific Railway Company agree upon the elimination of the grade at the crossing of the said street by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company it does not entitle either party to call upon the Toronto Railway Company to contribute to the cost of the same.\"\nD. L. McCarthy K.C. for the appellant. The order of the Board was not made for the protection of the public but was merely a matter of municipal improvement. The fact that the appellant company was benefitted did not empower the Board to saddle it with a portion of the coat. British Columbia Electric Railway Co. v. Vancouver, Victoria and Eastern Railway Co.[1].\nW. N. Tilley K.C. for the respondents the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. referred to City of Toronto v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[2]; Ottawa Electric. Railway Co. v. City of Ottawa[3].\nColquhoun for the respondent the City of Toronto.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This is an appeal by leave against an order of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada dated the 12th November, 1914, made in the matter of the apportionment of the cost of the grade separation work at North. Toronto (exclusive of Yonge street), whereby and so far as the appellants are alone concerned it was ordered\nthat 10% of the cost of the separation of grades at Avenue Road, North Toronto, be borne and paid by the Toronto Street Railway Company.\nThe \"Railway Act\" gives power to the Railway Board where a railway is constructed across a highway to order that the railway be carried over the highway and to order what portion, if any, of cost is to be borne respectively by the municipal or other corporation or person in respect of such order. Though perhaps not very clearly worded, the meaning of section 238 must be that such order must be with a view to the protection, safety and convenience of the public.\nThat this enactment is intra vires of the power of Parliament I do not think admits of doubt; it was so decided in the case of City of Toronto v. Canadian Pacific Rly. Co.2. We have therefore only to consider whether or not the order so far as it directed the appellant to pay a portion of the cost was made without jurisdiction.\nAt the argument much stress was laid by counsel for the appellant on the case of British Columbia Electric Railway Co. v. Vancouver, etc., Railway Co. and The City of Vancouver[4]; indeed, I apprehend that but for that case the present appeal would hardly have been brought. The decision of the Judicial Committee in that case, however, depends upon the facts of the particular case. The application to the Railway Board for an order for four streets to be carried across the railway on viaducts was made by the city corporation and their Lordships approved of the statement that\nthe occasion for the application arose from the necessity of determining the permanent grade of these four streets.\nThe judgment continues:\u2014\nIt follows therefore that the application was a matter between the corporation and the railway company alone. * * * It is evident from the reasons given by the Railway Board that they directed the tramway company to pay a proportion of the cost of the improvements because they were of opinion that the tramway company would benefit by them. * * * The fundamental error underlying the decision of the Railway Board is that they have considered that the fact that the tramway company would be benefitted by the works, gave them jurisdiction to make them pay the cost or a portion of it.\nThere is nothing in the \"Railway Act\" which gives any such jurisdiction.\nNow the facts in the present case are wholly different. It is abundantly clear from the record that the substantial and, indeed I think I may say only, reason for the order of the Railway Board for this grade separation was the elimination of dangerous crossings. That incidentally the tramway company will be benefitted by the separation of the grades cannot of course bring the case within the ruling of the Judicial Committee in the Vancouver Case. If the tramway company could have been ordered to pay part of the cost though they derived no benefit from the work, it would be absurd to suppose that they could not be so ordered because they did obtain benefit.\nIt can make no difference that occasion was taken for abolishing this crossing when the separation of grades in a neighbouring street was decided upon. The two subways were naturally and properly ordered as part of one scheme for the public safety and convenience.\nWhatever the rights of the appellant and the City of Toronto, respondent, under their agreement they are only as between the parties and cannot affect the validity of the order of the Railway Board.\nDavies J.\u2014This is an appeal from an order of the Board of Railway Commissioners directing the Toronto Railway Company to pay a portion of the cost of a subway ordered by the Board to be constructed at Avenue Road in the City of Toronto. Leave to appeal was granted by the Chief Justice on the ground that the Board had no jurisdiction to make the order complained of.\nLeave to appeal was also granted by the Chief Commissioner upon certain questions of law;\n1. As to the power of the Board to order the appellant to contribute to the cost of the construction of the subway in question.\n2. As to the effect of an agreement between the appellant and the City of Toronto upon the granting of the order appealed from; or, as I understand the questions, whether that agreement precluded the Board from making such order. \"The main question of the jurisdiction of the Board bo make the order involves the constitutionality of the provisions of the \"Railway Act\" under which it professedly was made, and also involves the questions whether, assuming the sections to be constitutionally valid, the order of the Board was really and truly made under its paramount power of providing at railway and highway crossings for the safety and protection of the public, or whether the subway at Avenue Road was a matter really and practically of street improvements merely, the cost of which the appellants could not be obliged to contribute to.\nPassing by for a moment its constitutional validity, sec. 227 of the \"Railway Act,\" as amended by the Act of 1909 regulating the crossing of railway lines by other railway tracks or lines, vests very ample and complete powers in the Railway Board alike as to the terms, conditions and incidents subject to which such crossing may be allowed, as also with respect to the kind and nature of such crossing, and when read in conjunction with sections 28 and 32 of the \"Railway Act\" would authorize the Board to proceed under such section 227 as well on its own motion, as on a special application for leave to permit a crossing; and as well with respect to an existing crossing which had been allowed by it or by its predecessor the Railway Committee of the Privy Council as with respect to a right to a new crossing sought to be obtained.\nWhen it is once made clear to the Board of Railway Commissioners that the public protection and safety requires that a crossing of railway tracks applied for should only be granted on certain terms and conditions or that an existing crossing requires additional safeguards and protection, then I think under the 227th section of the Act coupled with the 28th, 29th, 32nd and 59th sections the powers of the Board are complete for the purposes the legislature intended and may be exercised by them either of their own motion or on special application made to them.\nIf I am wrong in my construction of these sections of the Act, I am still of the opinion that under the special circumstances of this case, namely, where the double tracks of the Toronto Street Railway along Avenue Road cross the double tracks of the Canadian Pacific Railway where they cross; that road, the Board had ample powers under section 258 relating to highway crossings to make such order as to the protection, safety and convenience of the public as it did make in this case and including that part of the order assigning the proportion of the costs of the new protection works to the Toronto Street Railway which in the judgment of the Board that street railway should assume and pay.\nThen comes the question whether in making the order now in appeal assigning the street railway's contribution towards the construction work ordered, the Board acted under its paramount power of providing for the protection and safety of the public at these railway crossings on this public street or highway, or made it for some other reason or motive.\nMr. McCarthy contended strenuously that they did not make it under the paramount power for protection and safety and that the assessment of the Toronto Street Railway was not legal or justifiable, because it was based, as he contended, upon the grounds that the Toronto Street Railway Company were relieved of the expense of contributing to the cost of operating the then interlocking plant necessitated by their crossing at rail level the tracks of the Canadian Pacific Railway and were also relieved of the possibility of an accident at that crossing. That was, he contended, the real reason for assessing a contribution towards the subway upon the Toronto Railway.\nNo doubt some observations were made by the Assistant Chief Commissioner in the reasons given on the 5th May, 1914, for the order assessing a portion of the cost of the protection works ordered on and at Avenue Road which give colour to this argument.\nThese observations and the argument at bar on the point necessitated a very close scrutiny of the entire record of the proceedings before the Board of Railway Commissioners at its several meetings in order to determine what the real grounds were on which the order complained of was made. I have made such a scrutiny with the result that no doubt exists in my mind that the controlling ground which moved the Commissioners to make the order in question was the safety and protection of the public and that the separation of the grades at Avenue Road was ordered mainly if not entirely for that reason, and not with any idea of municipal improvement. The observations made by the Assistant Chief Commissioner in his reasons for making the subway order were intended, I think, not as reasons for the making of the order for the subway, but rather as reasons in support of the quantum of the cost which they had allotted to the Toronto Railway Company to pay.\nThe then existing interlocking plant at the crossing in question which constituted the protection and safety provided for the public at this point was no doubt sufficient for the day and times when it was ordered. But the City of Toronto, it is a matter of common knowledge, has enormously increased its population during the past few years. The traffic on its principal streets has greatly increased and the Board, in acting as it did in making the order, had the benefit of a report on the subject it was dealing with made by its engineers and a knowledge of the facts gained from such report and the plans before it and from the repeated discussions by counsel at its several meetings and from, I assume, actual views of the locality made by its members.\nMr. Maclean, one of the Board of Railway Commissioners, in his reasons for concurring in the order appealed from, says:\u2014\nAt the hearing, Mr. Geary, for the city, pressed with great earnestness the contention that the city should not be called upon to contribute to the cost of the grade separation. The work, however, is undoubtedly in the interest of public safety. The element of danger which was manifestly present was attributable not only to the increase of traffic on the railway, but also to the increase of traffic on the highways. The railway was rightfully in its location, under proper sanction of law; and the Board is, in my opinion, justified in following the methods of division of cost which it hitherto has applied. The fact that the method of distribution of cost has had the sanction of precedent is, to my mind, by no means the most important factor.\nOn the whole, I repeat, the only conclusion I could draw from a careful reading of the whole record is that the paramount consideration which weighed with the Board and moved it to make the order was the \"protection, safety and convenience of the public.\"\nThen with regard to the constitutional validity of the sections in question, I cannot entertain any doubt. Similar legislation was before this court in the case of The City of Toronto v. The Grand Trunk Railway Co.[5], when the constitutional validity of sections 18.7 and 188 of \"The Railway Act of 1888\" was involved. Substantially, and for the purposes of this constitutional argument, these sections are the same as those of the present \"Railway Act\" now before us. This court held these sections to be intra vires of the Parliament of Canada. Leave to appeal was refused by the Privy Council.\nSubsequently the question of the constitutional validity of these sections 187 and 188 of \"The Railway Act of 1888\" was brought before the Judicial Committee in the case of the City of Toronto v. The Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[6], when they were held to be intra vires and where it was further held that a municipal corporation was a \"person interested\" within the meaning of the words of the section.\nIn delivering the judgment of their Lordships, Lord Collins says:\u2014\nIn the present case it seems quite clear to their Lordships that if, to use the language above quoted, \"the field were clear,\" the sections impugned do no more than provide reasonable means for safeguarding in the common interest the public and the railway which is committed to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Legislature which enacted them, and were, therefore, intra vires. If the precautions ordered are reasonably necessary, it is obvious that they must be paid for, and in the view of their Lordships there is nothing ultra vires in the ancillary power conferred by the sections on the Committee to make an equitable adjustment of the expenses among the persons interested. This legislation is clearly passed from a point of view more natural in a young and growing community interested in developing the resources of a vast territory as yet not fully settled than it could possibly be in the narrow and thickly populated area of such a country as England. To such a community it might well seem reasonable that those who derived special advantages from the proximity of a railway might bear a special share of the expenses of safeguarding it. Both the substantive and the ancillary provision are alike reasonable and intra vires of the Dominion Legislature, and on the principles above cited must prevail, even if there is legislation intra vires of the provincial Legislature dealing with the same subject matter and in some sense inconsistent.\nI find myself in the face of the different provisions of the \"Railway Act\" and the decisions of the courts upon them quite unable to appreciate or accept the argument that the Toronto. Street Railway is not a company \"interested or affected\" in the change of grades at the Avenue Road and the protective works ordered there within the meaning of the sections of the Act applicable.\nThe recent decision of the Privy Council in the British Columbia Electric Railway Co. v. Vancouver, Victoria and Eastern Railway Co. and The City of Vancouver[7], was of course much relied upon by the appellant who sought to make the facts of this appeal analogous to the facts of that case. Superficially there may be some resemblance between the facts in both cases, but it is only superficially. The headnote to the report of the British Columbia Electric Railway case before the Privy Council states the facts and the decision as follows:\u2014\nThe corporation of the City of Vancouver, wishing to alter the grading of four streets in the city which were crossed by the tracks of a Dominion railway, applied to the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada for authority to carry the streets over the railway tracks on bridges. Along two of the streets in question a railway company, working wholly within the province under provincial statutory authority, ran tramways. The Board authorized the work and ordered that a part of the cost of construction should be borne by the provincial company, on the ground that that company would benefit by the alteration:\u2014\nHeld, that the order, so far as it imposed part of the cost of the proposed work upon the provincial railway company, was not within the powers conferred upon the Board of Railway Commissioners by the \"Railway Act\" and was invalid.\nTurning to the reasons for the judgment of the Judicial Committee, as pronounced by Lord Moulton, it will be seen how utterly inapplicable that judgment is to the case before us. His Lordship in the first place entirely agrees with the remarks of Duff J. of this court as to the ground and reason of the application of the corporation to the Railway Board. He goes on to say:\u2014\nMr. Baxter's statement makes it quite clear that the occasion for the application arose from the necessity of determining the permanent grade of these four streets. It was a question, he said, whether on the one hand the grade was to be elevated, or on the other, the grade was to be made to conform to the grade of the railway tracks and level crossings established. It was necessary to have the matter disposed of because people were applying for permits to build upon these streets, and these could not be granted owing to the inability of the municipality to give the grade of the streets. The council preferred the former of the two alternative courses because they recognized that the street grades were too low and must inevitably be raised.\nHis Lordship then adds:\nIt follows therefore that the application was a matter between the corporation and the railway company alone.\nThe proposed works for which the authority of the Railway Board had been asked and granted was a matter merely of \"street improvements\" and he goes on to say:\nIt is evident from the reasons given by the Railway Board that they directed the tramway company to pay a proportion of the cost of the improvements because they were of the opinion that the tramway company would benefit by them.\nAnd later he sums up his reasons for judgment by saying:\nThe fundamental error underlying the decision of the Railway Board is that they have considered that the fact that the tramway company would be benefitted by the works gave them jurisdiction to make them pay the cost or a portion of it. There is nothing in the \"Railway Act\" which gives any such jurisdiction.\nHe further points out that the order does not come under the powers of section 59 of the \"Railway Act\":\nIt does not direct that any work should be done. It is an order of a purely permissive character granting a privilege to the corporation which they may exercise at the expense of a third party, and it leaves it to the corporation to decide whether they shall avail themselves of it or not. The provisions of s. 59 relate to a wholly different class of cases.\nThe substance of the judgment, as I understand it, is that on the facts the works for which the electric company was ordered, on the application of the corporation of the city, to pay a portion of the cost were not works ordered by the Board \"for the safety and protection of the public\" at railway or highway crossings, but were merely a matter of street improvements, and that the order was of a\npurely permissive character granting a privilege to the corporation which they might exercise at the expense of a third party.\nThere is nothing comparable between such a proposed work and the one ordered in this case. The one is a matter merely of \"street improvements\" for which a \"permissive order\" is given and a part of the expense of which if undertaken at all by the corporation is ordered to be paid by an electric company because the works may benefit it. The other, the one before us, is a work ordered by the Railway Commissioners under, as I hold, their paramount power of ordering works at highway and railway crossings for the safety and protection of the public.\nAs I hold the sections of the Act in question, and before by me specially referred to, to be intra vires of the Parliament of Canada and the works ordered to have been so ordered not as a matter of street improvements but for the safety and protection of the public, I would dismiss the appeal against the jurisdiction of the Board with costs.\nI would answer the questions of law submitted to us as follows:\nThe first question in the affirmative;\nThe second question: I do not think the agreement referred to in the second and third questions precluded the Board from making the order requiring the Toronto Railway to contribute to the cost of the subway ordered. Idington J.\u2014The Railway Commissioners for Canada, clearly intending to promote the safety of the public and solely for that purpose, acting upon their own initiative, as empowered to do when they see fit for such a purpose, ordered on the 13th September, 1910, their approval of a plan dated May, 1910, filed by the railway company.\nThe plan so referred to was the result of many meetings and much work by both the officers of the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. and of the Board, in the way of meeting the wishes of the latter to have some of the many grade crossings done away with.\nIt appears from the circular of 15th July, 1909, that the Board had been prompted, to take the steps it did, by Parliament in 1909 providing aid for the elimination of grade crossings, and by the discussion therein, and the general expression of public opinion.\nSuch being the origin of what led up to the order of 13th September, 1910, and the subsequent history exhibiting the determination of the Board on the subject, I read this order made, after hearing all the parties concerned, as an imperative direction to the railway companies concerned to eliminate the Avenue Road grade crossing and separate there the grades at crossing of the two railways.\nThe informal nature of the order leads me to state thus why I assume it must be treated as an order of the character I ascribe to it.\nThe parties concerned never seem to have supposed it anything else, but like people of sense acted upon it as if it must be obeyed.\nThe Canadian Pacific Railway Co. apparently had the burden of the work imposed upon it but the other company was put for many months to great inconvenience before venturing to lay its rails on the subway thus created.\nIn making the order the Board reserved the question of the cost of work and all implied therein for a future hearing, if the parties could not agree.\nWhen that came the appellant disputed any liability and denied any power in the Board to deal with the subject, as it (the appellant) was a purely provincial corporation.\nNevertheless the Board ordered the appellant to pay ten per cent. of the cost and allowed it to appeal on three questions for our decision.\nThe first is as follows:\u2014\n1. Whether the Board had power to order the Toronto Railway Company to contribute to the cost of the construction of the subway in question,\nand merely involves the question of jurisdiction in respect of which leave to appeal had already been given by the Chief Justice of this court.\nI think, having regard to what appears in the case and which I have tried to epitomize, and also to the general scope of the \"Railway Act\" and direct requirements of many provisions more or less bearing upon the powers of the Board and especially those of section 8, sub-section (a), section 59 and section 238 of the \"Railway Act\" that the Board had jurisdiction to make the order now in question.\nSection 238 clearly expresses the power to deal with the whole matter by directing the separation of grades.\nSection 8, sub-section (a) as clearly indicates the crossing of these roads as a subject matter within the jurisdiction of the Board. And section 59 seems to enable the Board to apportion the cost between those interested and direct payment accordingly.\nThese sections must be read in the form they now respectively stand, for section 238 as it stood in the R.S.C. 1906 has been repealed and been much expanded by the section substituted therefor in 8 & 9 Edw. VII., ch. 32, sec. 5, probably to meet the Toronto Viaduct Case[8] which I am about to refer to, and incidentally to put beyond question the powers of the Board over such a subject matter as grade crossings. The latter section enables in express terms the Board of its own motion,\nor upon complaint or application, by or on behalf of the Crown, or any municipal or other corporation, or any person aggrieved, order the company to submit to the Board, within a specified time, a plan and profile of such portion of the railway, and may cause inspection of such portion, etc.\nMy only difficulty in the case is an apparent conflict of authority raised by the decision relied upon in the argument by appellant's counsel to which I am about to refer.\nOn the one hand we have these clear and explicit provisions of the \"Railway Act\" as it stands amended and the decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council maintaining decisions of this court and Ontario courts holding, under the provisions of the \"Railway Act\" as it then stood before the Act was made so explicit as it now is, that mere municipal corporations only indirectly interested were liable to contribute even to a less effective (and only secondary) means of providing for the safety of the public.\nI say these municipal corporations were only indirectly interested for they had only, in regard to highways, a duty to keep them in repair. They might or might not own them and had only a limited authority to levy taxes, in short were mere creatures of the local legislature liable to have their powers expanded or contracted as it saw fit. Nevertheless they were held parties interested.\nThese cases are represented by what appears to be the final authoritative decision of the Judicial Committee in the case of City of Toronto v. The Canadian Racific Railway Co.[9].\nIt would seem as if the appellant running a street railway across the Canadian Pacific Ely. Company's (respondent's) railway in the locality and situation such as described in the opinion judgment of the Board should be much more directly interested in the safety of the public at that crossing point than any mere municipal corporation.\nNo one ever supposed for an instant that so long as the highway was kept in repair the municipality was liable for any of the numerous accidents at such crossings. But even provincial railways and tramways have had to suffer in that regard.\nYet, on the other hand, years after the decision above referred to and when section 238 of the Act had been amended and other legislation passed dealing with the very grave question of grade crossings and seeking through the Board to eliminate them in part at least, we have the decision of the court above in the case of the British Columbia Electric Railway Co. v. Vancouver, etc. Railway Co.[10] reversing an order of the Board maintained by this court, approving of a plan for separating the grades as in the order here in question, and directing the appellant (there in question) to contribute to the expense of executing that plan of separation. The difference between the scheme propounded in that plan and the one involved herein is that the municipal corporation plan there was to carry its highway, and therewith the B. C. Electric Railway, over the steam railway, by a bridge instead of as here in question providing for the crossing by the raising of the C. P. Rly. track and the highway going under in a subway wherein the appellant might lay a new track and thus attain identically the same object which was to separate the grades and thus ensure the safety of the public.\nOne other difference was that the application there was made to the Board by the municipal corporation and here the proceeding is one initiated by the Board.\nI am puzzled to know how that creates any substantial difference for section 238 as amended expressly provided for \"any municipal or other corporation\" moving in the matter. Nor can I see that because that municipal corporation incidentally desired something to proceed in way of settling its street grades contemporaneously with executing a most desirable purpose of eliminating one or more grade crossings, their application should be held null.\nIt is quite clear that the Board imagined they were acting within the legislation promoting the abolition of grade crossings, for by the order made in that case it provided for three grants of $5,000 each being paid out of the Railway Grade Crossing fund, created by Parliament for the express purpose of eliminating progressively the grade crossings.\nThe only other distinction between that case and this would seem to be that the order was permissive or conditional instead of being peremptory. Probably that was a gentler method of accomplishing the desired result and could hurt no one, unless and until acted upon, and then would execute the wishes of the Board.\nThe relations between the appellant and the municipality at that particular juncture added force to the vigorous objections made to that phase of the order.\nThe distinction between the permissive and conditional character of that order especially under the circumstances existent in connection therewith and this one, clearly made on the initiative of the Board, and free from obvious difficulties suggested in the other, I think distinguishes the two cases sufficiently to maintain the order now in question without at all disregarding the decision of the court above.\nIt is to be observed that the court above refrained from acting upon the view of the law presented by the minority judgment in that case in this court. That is the more noticeable for the court above drew its statement of fact from that very judgment which strenuously maintained the position that it would be ultra vires Parliament to enact anything upon which such an order as there in question could be founded.\nThe alleged power of Parliament is what appellant also challenges and denies herein and thus raises the only really important question in this case.\nUnless and until it is expressly held by the court above that it is not, as heretofore supposed, to be within the power of Parliament to deal effectively with all relating to crossing railroads (whether they are both the properties of corporate creations of Parliament or one or more the property of a provincial corporation and the other of Parliament) so long as one is the creation of Parliament, I think we are bound by the view taken by the court above in the earlier Toronto case, and certainly not overruled in this later British Columbia Electric Railway Company's Case[11], to abide by what I think has become settled law.\nThat view of the law was upheld in this court in the case of In re Alberta Railway Act[12], and in the same case in the Privy Council, Attorney-General for Alberta v. Attorney-General for Canada[13], at page 370.\nI am not disposed to confine as suggested should be done the words of the \"Railway Act\" referring to crossing railways to the mere physical contact of a crossing on the level, for the sections of the Act already referred to evidently contemplate a crossing where there is no such crossing contact possible.\nIndeed in our country in many places such a thing would be impossible, yet control of the crossings must fall under the words \"crossing railways.\"\nI therefore think the appellant came for the purposes of this case within the jurisdiction of the Board.\nThe leave given originally to appellant to cross the Canadian Pacific Railway on Avenue Road ended, as I understood Mr. McCarthy frankly to concede, when the Board decided on another mode of crossing. And it follows that it must, in using the new method of effecting that crossing, be held assenting to the Board's adoption of the new plan. It must abide by the terms imposed upon its impliedly assenting thereto and accepting and using that new mode.\nI say impliedly for there was no express order made in that regard.\nCounsel assumes that the appellant had a right to use the highway and needs no more. I do not think it is any answer in law. It is ingenious, but will not stand examination, as someone may find to his cost should he running a car plunge through that subway at the moment of an accident on the spot, when he might need authority for being there at all, and wish his master had got an express order from the Board giving him the right to be there.\nAs to the other two questions presented I see nothing in the agreement between the appellant and the city disabling the Board from dealing with the matter as it has.\nThere may be something fairly arguable as to the power of the Board to have placed upon the city part of the burden of the cost, either under the decisions I have referred to, or under those coupled with the terms of the agreement.\nI can find nothing in either as a matter of law imperatively binding the Board to do so. And when the safety of the public is the chief thing involved, then the inutility of contracts or implication therein for or by-way of binding the power of the Board was exemplified in Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. City of Toronto et al[14], and in the same case in this court. Sections 237 and 248, possibly enacted to fit that case and all such like, were made to predominate over everything else standing in the way of the Board.\nI express, indeed have, no opinion as to the legal right to remedy now by one against the other of such contracting parties as the appellant and the city.\nPerhaps if the orders of the Board presented in a formally express manner the exact authority it is presuming to act under, the doing so might avoid some confusion and possible miscarriage of what it intends to direct. I may also add that much we heard of the Yonge Street crossing and its relation to the questions involved herein seems to me beside that which we have to deal with.\nYonge Street crossing turned out to be a mere question of public convenience which is equally within the power of the Board as that relative to the safety of the public.\nIt has nothing to do with the questions raised herein except historical, as it were.\nI see no reason why the Board should not deal with both questions at the same time.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014The Toronto Railway Company, a provincial corporation operating a line of electric tramway on Avenue Road, a public street in the City of Toronto, appeals against an order of the Dominion Board of Railway Commissioners, whereby it is required to pay one-tenth of the cost of constructing a subway ordered by the Board at the crossing of Avenue Road by the tracks of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, a Dominion corporation operating a steam railway. At the point in question there had been since 1902 a crossing at rail level of the tracks of the Canadian Pacific Railway, by the tracks of the Toronto Railway, authorized by orders of the Railway Committee of the Privy Council made on the application of the Toronto Railway Company under sections 173-177 of the Dominion \"Railway Act\" of 1888\u2014the predecessors of ss. 227-229 of the present \"Railway Act,\" R.S.C., 1906, c. 37. By those orders the Toronto Railway Company was required to provide, and to pay the cost of maintaining, certain additional protection at this highway crossing ordered by the Railway Committee in consequence of the advent of its tramway.\nIn 1909 the Dominion Parliament established a fund for\naiding in the providing by actual construction work of protection, safety and convenience for the public in respect of highway crossings of the railway at rail level.\nand placed the administration of this fund, subject to certain restrictions, in the hands of the Railway Board (\"Railway Act,\" s. 239 (a) enacted by 8 & 9 Edw. VII., c. 32, s. 7.)\nThe record discloses that the proceedings which led to the making of the order for the separation of the grades of the C. P. Railway and of Avenue Road, including the grade of the Toronto Railway, were initiated on July 1st, 1909, by the Railway Board of its own motion for the purpose of carrying out the intention of Parliament in passing the legislation of that year embodied in s. 239 (a) of the \"Railway Act.\" No doubt the project for the elimination of the level crossing at Yonge Street which was first taken up, probably because it was the most important, led to the consideration of the neighbouring crossing at Avenue Road and to the direction given by the Board, on the recommendation of its chief engineer, that the C.P.R. Company should submit plans covering the elimination of the latter level crossing as well as that at Yonge Street. But it is equally clear that the Board in giving this direction and in making its subsequent order for the separation of grades and the construction of the subway at Avenue Road was not solely influenced by the fact that the carrying out of the Yonge Street project rendered the work at Avenue Road desirable, if not necessary, but was actuated largely, if not chiefly, by the consideration that the level crossing at Avenue Road itself was highly dangerous and that its elimination was demanded in the interests of \"the protection, safety and convenience of the public.\" As the Chief Commissioner (Mr. Mabee) remarked, when making an order on the 17th June, 1910, adding the Toronto Railway Company as a party because it was interested in the Avenue Road crossing, though not in that at Yonge Street, plans for both having been presented,\nThese plans now certainly take care of two very dangerous crossings.\nThe Canadian Pacific Railway Company had itself reported Yonge Street and Avenue Road as dangerous crossings and counsel representing it alluded to that fact at the meeting of the Board at which the subway plans were approved. The appellant's somewhat disingenuous reference to the grade of Avenue Road as having been \"altered by arrangement between the municipality and the Dominion road\" is an obvious attempt to bring this case within the purview of the recent decision of the Privy Council in the British Columbia Electric Railway Co. v. Vancouver, Victoria and Eastern Railway Co.[15].\nMoreover, if the proceedings should be regarded as having been commenced solely in respect of the Yonge Street crossing, under s.s. 1 of s. 238, as enacted by 8 & 9 Edw. VII., c. 32, s. 5, the Board is empowered to deal not only with any highway crossing at which in its opinion the protection, safety and convenience of the public require that it shall order works to be executed or other measures to be taken, but also with\nany other crossing directly or indirectly affected.\nThe question presented is whether under these circumstances the Railway Board had jurisdiction to order the Toronto Railway Company to bear a portion of the cost of the works which it directed at Avenue Road. Its jurisdiction is contested upon two grounds\u2014that the Dominion \"Railway Act\" does not purport to confer such jurisdiction upon it; and that, if it does, the legislation is ultra vires.\nFor the sake of brevity I shall speak of railways under the legislative jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada as Dominion railways and of railways or tramways under provincial legislative jurisdiction as provincial railways or tramways.\nIt is obvious that in the present case there are two matters in respect of which the Railway Board may have jurisdiction\u2014one, the crossing of the Dominion railway by the provincial tramway; the other, the crossing of the Dominion railway by the street or highway. These crossings are separately dealt with by the \"Railway Act\"\u2014the former by sections 227-229; the latter by sections 237 et seq. For sections substituted for ss. 237 and 238 of R. S. C. c. 37, see 8 & 9 Edw. VII., c. 32, ss. 4-6.\nBy s. 8 (a) of the Dominion \"Railway Act\" every provincial railway or tramway which connects with or crosses a Dominion railway is made subject to the provisions of that Act relating to the connection or crossing of one railway or tramway by another, so far as relates to such crossing. The provisions thus made applicable are ss. 227 and 229. (British Columbia Electric Railway Co. v. Vancouver Victoria and Eastern Railway Co.[16], at p. 1075).\nUnder s. 227 the crossing of a Dominion railway by the tracks or lines of any other railway company without leave of the Board, is prohibited: by s.s. 3 the Board is empowered (a) to grant a crossing application on such terms as to protection and safety as it deems expedient; (b) to change the plan submitted and fix the place and mode of crossing; (c) to direct that one line or track or one set of lines or tracks be carried over or under another line or track or set of lines or tracks; (d) to direct the construction of such works, structures, etc., as appear to it best adapted to remove and prevent all danger of accident, injury or damage.\nThis section, ex facie, deals only with an application for leave in the first instance to cross a Dominion railway and does not explicitly cover the case of a change or modification becoming necessary or desirable in the protection or character of a crossing already established. It is argued for the respondents, however, that the order of the Board may be treated as having terminated the existing right of level crossing, which had been granted to the Toronto Railway Company by the Railway Committee of the Privy Council, and that, having regard to all the circumstances, that company should be deemed to have been again an applicant to the Board for leave to cross the Dominion railway, this time by means of a subway. Under s. 29 of the \"Railway Act\" the Board may\nreview, rescind, change, alter or vary any order or decision made by it,\nand by s. 32 (2) it is given the like power in respect of orders which had been made by the Railway Committee of the Privy Council, which it succeeded. The Board would, therefore, seem to have been competent to vary the order originally made by the Railway Committee of the Privy Council, which granted the application of the Toronto Railway Company to cross the tracks of the C. P. R. at rail level, by directing under clauses (b) (c) and (d) of s.s. 3 of s. 227, that the mode of crossing should be changed, that the lines or tracks of the Toronto Railway should be carried under those of the C. P. Railway and that works or structures deemed by the Board best adapted to remove or prevent all danger of accident, injury, or damage should be constructed, etc. The Board might make such an order sua sponte, (s. 28); and by s. 59 it is empowered to\norder by what company, municipality or person interested or affected\nby any order made for the construction of works, and in what proportion, the cost and expense thereof shall be paid. It would seem to follow that without treating the Toronto Railway Company as an applicant to it for a right to cross the lines or tracks of the C. P. Railway by means of or through a subway, the Board, subject to the question of the constitutionality of the Dominion legislation, in view of the provisions of s. 8 (a), had jurisdiction, exercising the powers conferred on it by'ss. 28, 29, 32 (2), 227 (3) and 59, to make the order in question.\nSubject again to the question of constitutional validity, I think it also had jurisdiction to make that order under s. 238, as enacted by 8 & 9 Edw. VII., c. 32. The subject matter before it was the crossing of a Dominion railway by a highway as well as by a provincial tramway. Sec. 238, unlike s. 227, expressly deals with existing crossings. The jurisdiction of the Board under s. 238 to order, of its own motion, or upon complaint or application, that the highway be carried under the railway and that the works in its opinion best adapted to remove or diminish the danger or obstruction in respect of such crossing be constructed is unquestioned. Its power under s. s. 3 of s. 238 or s. s. 2 of s. 59 to order the payment of a portion of the cost of such works by the provincial municipal corporation which controls the highway at the actual crossing has not been challenged since the decision of this court in City of Toronto v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.[17], from which the Privy Council refused leave to appeal[18]; its right to require another municipal corporation in control of an adjacent portion of the highway not actually crossed by the railway also to contribute to the cost of the works ordered was expressly affirmed by the Judicial Committee, when challenged not merely upon the construction of s. 188 of the \"Railway Act\" of 1888 and s. 47 of the \"Railway Act\" of 1903 (corresponding respectively to s. 238 and s. 59 of the present statute), but also upon the constitutional validity of these provisions. It was then held that a municipal corporation in either position was a \"person interested\" within the meaning of s. 188 of the Act of 1888\u2014\"a municipality or person interested or affected\" within the meaning of s., 47 of the Act of 1903; City of Toronto v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[19].\nThe language of the present s. 59 is the same as that of s. 47 of the Act of 1903; that of the present s. 238 (3) is\u2014\nThe Board may order what portion, if any, of the cost is to be borne respectively by the company, municipal or other corporation, or person\non whose application the Board may, under s. s. 1, order the construction of the works.\nIt was also held by the Privy Council that\nthere is nothing ultra vires in the ancillary power conferred by the sections on the Committee (now the Board) to make an equitable adjustment of the expenses among persons interested. * * * Both the substantive and the ancillary provisions are alike reasonable and intra vires of the Dominion Legislature. City of Toronto v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[20], at pp. 58-9.\nThe substantive provision empowered the Board to order the works; the ancillary, to apportion the cost and to direct payment.\nIn respect of the constitutional validity of the sections of the \"Railway Act\" in so far as they authorize the imposition of the cost of works or precautionary measures upon persons or bodies other than the Dominion railway concerned, I am unable to discern any real ground of distinction between municipal corporations, the creatures of, and, in all their relations, subject to the control of, the provincial legislatures, to which exclusive legislative power in regard to \"municipal institutions in the province\" has been committed by clause 8 of s. 92 of the B. N. A. Act, and \"local works and undertakings\" (including provincial railways), which are likewise placed under exclusive provincial control by clause 10 of the same section. Since the Dominion railway company might, however inequitably, be required to bear the entire burden of the expense of crossing protection, it cannot be said to be absolutely necessary that the Railway Board should have authority to impose any part of that expense on any other person or on any other corporation, Dominion or provincial. In regard to both municipal corporations and provincial railway corporations alike Dominion interference must be confined to what is\nnecessarily incidental to the exercise of the powers conferred on it by the enumerative heads of clause 91 of the B. N. A. Act\nAttorney-General for Ontario v. Attorney-General for Canada[21]), other than \"the regulation of trade and commerce.\" City of Montreal v. Montreal Street Rly. Co.[22]. The right of the Dominion Parliament to provide for\nan equitable distribution among the persons interested\nof the expense of furnishing\nreasonable means for safe-guarding in the common interest the public and the railway\nwhen Dominion railways are crossed by highways has been expressly recognized in the Privy Council in City of Toronto v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[23], as something within the ancillary power of Parliament\u2014as necessarily incidental to its exclusive jurisdiction over\nlines of * * * railways * * * connecting the province with any other province or provinces or extending beyond the limits of provinces. B.N.A. Act, s. 92, clause 10 (a).\nThe power to order municipal corporations to contribute to the cost of crossing works cannot be any more necessary to complete and effective legislative jurisdiction over Dominion railways than the like power in respect of tramway companies whose lines cross such railways. Neither provincial railways nor municipal highways are dealt with by the Railway Board as such under the legislation in question. Both the provincial railway company and the municipal corporation are dealt with under it merely as bodies interested in crossings of Dominion railways and because of such interest, affected by the orders of the Board.\nThe question remains whether under the circumstances of the present case the Toronto Railway Company is a \"company, municipality or person interested in, or affected by, the order\" for the construction of a subway at Avenue Road and the depression of its tracks involved therein, within the purview of s. 59 of the \"Railway Act,\" or a \"corporation or person\" on whose complaint or application the Board might have ordered the works under s. 238 of the same Act. Whether the order of the Board should be viewed solely as an exercise of its power under s. 238 (supplemented if need be by s. 59), the Toronto Railway Company being concerned because of its presence and rights upon the highway, or whether as to that company the order should also be regarded as made under the provisions of clauses (c) and (d) of s.s. 3 of s. 227, supplemented by the provisions of ss. 28, 29, 32(2), 59 and 8(a) I entirely fail to appreciate the force of the contention that the company is not a \"company interested or affected\" within the meaning of s. 59 by the order of the Board for the change in conditions at the Avenue Road crossing or that it is not a \"corporation\" on whose application that order might have been made under s. 238 and therefore under s.s. 3 liable for such portion of the cost of the works directed as the Board has ordered it to bear. The order for the separation of grades and the construction of the subway certainly affects the Toronto Railway Company very directly. It deprives it of its existing right of level crossing and provides for it a new and much more advantageous means of crossing the Dominion railway. It may well be too that the width and depth of the subway ordered depended, to some extent at least, upon the use of the highway by the Toronto Railway for its double lines of track. Its presence upon the highway may have constituted the chief element of danger in the existing level crossing. I find it difficult to conceive how it could properly be held that the Toronto Railway Company was not interested or affected or was not a \"corporation\" within s.s. 1 and 3 of s. 238.\nThe recent case of British Columbia Electric Railway Co. v. Vancouver Victoria and Eastern Railway Co.[24], was much relied upon at bar by counsel for the appellant. In that case, in the opinion of the Judicial Committee, \"the ground and reason of the application\" of the municipal corporation, on which the Board acted, was municipal convenience and improvement. It was, in their Lordships' opinion,\na matter between the corporation and the railway company alone,\nfrom which the proper inference would seem to be that the order made by the Board was not regarded as an\norder as to the protection, safety and convenience of the public\nwithin s.s. 1 of s. 238, in respect of which under s.s. 3 the Board might order that a portion of the cost of the works should be borne by a corporation or person other than the Dominion railway or the municipal corporation at whose instance they were directed or sanctioned. In such a case the Judicial Committee negatives the right of the Board to order payment of a portion of the cost of the works merely because some benefit would accrue therefrom to the body or person upon whom it is sought to impose that burden. The order made by the Board did not \"direct that any work should be done;\" it was merely permissive. Therefore their Lordships held that it was not within the purview of s. 59.\nDealing with the question presented solely as one of construction of the \"Railway Act,\" and determining nothing as to the power of Parliament to confer upon the Railway Board the jurisdiction which it had attempted to exercise, their Lordships held that, in ordering the provincial tramway company, whose tracks running along the highway crossed the tracks of the Dominion railway company at rail level on two of the four streets in question, to pay a part of the cost of constructing bridges on those two streets to carry the highway, \"and incidentally the tracks of the tramway company, over those of the Dominion railway, the Board had exceeded the jurisdiction which the statute purports to confer upon it. But they rejected the contention of counsel for the Dominion railway company that, on the authority of Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Co. v. Fort William Land Investment Co.[25], the whole order should be rescinded.\nThe application to the Railway Commission in British Columbia Electric Rway. Co. v. Vancouver, Victoria and Eastern Rly. Co.[26] was made under ss. 237 and 238 of the \"Railway Act,\" as enacted by 8 & 9 Edw. VII., c. 32. As it concerned existing crossings, s. 238 was the provision applicable. The Railway Board dealt with the matter as one of grade separation. The sentence of the judgment of the Assistant Chief Commissioner in which he grants the application is as follows:\u2014\nIn this matter the Board is of the opinion that the application should be granted for the approval of grade separation at these four streets, Hastings, Pender, Keefer, and Harris.\nAfter directing that the work on the four streets should be proceeded with at once, he adds\nTherefore having decided that much, it is incumbent on us to say in what proportions the cost shall be borne by the interested parties. After dealing with the circumstances, making special allusion to the very considerable traffic on the tramway as indicative of the desirability of grade separation from \"the point of view of safety and convenience,\" the learned Commissioner pointed out the advantages to the tramway company of an overhead crossing and it was ordered to pay 20% of the cost of the works. By the order the Commissioners directed that towards the cost of one of the two crossings in which the tramway company was interested $5,000 should be paid out of the fund established by the legislation of 1909 (\"Railway Act,\" s. 239 (a))\nfor the purpose of aiding in the providing by actual construction work of protection, safety and convenience for the public in respect of highway crossings at the railway at rail level.\nThey regretted that the limitation precluding aid for more than three crossings in any one municipality in one year prevented their giving a like sum out of the fund towards the other crossing.\nNevertheless, their Lordships of the Judicial Committee viewed the matter dealt with not as one in which the action of the Board had been influenced by considerations of protection, safety or convenience of the public, but as one of street improvement merely, in which the municipal corporation and the Dominion railway company were alone concerned. There is no allusion in their judgment to s. 238, as enacted by 8 & 9 Edw. VII., c. 32, the third sub-section of which in explicit terms empowers the Railway Board to apportion amongst the \"company, municipal or other corporation or person\" on whose complaint or application it might have proceeded, the cost of any works or protection which it might order under s. s. 1. There was no similar provision in s. 238 of the \"Railway Act\" as it appears in c. 37 of the R. S. C. of 1906, and, if I may make the suggestion without disrespect, it would almost seem that the provisions of the amendment in 8 & 9 Edw. VII. had escaped their Lordships' attention. The point made as to the permissive character of the order pronounced by the Railway Board and the consequent inapplicability of s. 59 appear rather to support that view. Prior to the amendment of 1909 the authority to apportion the cost of works ordered under s. 238 depended on s. 59; since that time s. 238 itself contains the empowering provision.\nIn the present case the order is not permissive but mandatory. The proceedings were instituted not by a municipal corporation but by the Board itself. They were prompted by the legislation of 1909 providing a fund to aid in the construction of works for the protection, safety and convenience of the public. That the Board was influenced by considerations of public safety was made clear in what took place prior to the addition, on the 7th of June, 1910, of the Toronto Railway Company as a party interested and again when the decision was finally reached on the 13th September, 1910, to order grade separation and subways at Yonge Street and Avenue Road and to reserve for further consideration the question of cost. It is not at all improbable that one of the chief sources of danger in the case of Avenue Road was the crossing at rail level at the foot of a steep hill of the double tracks of the C. P. Railway by the double tracks of the Toronto Railway. The advantages to the latter company of the subway crossing are obvious. That it was affected by the order and interested in the work seems to me to be as indisputable as that it was a corporation on whose complaint or application the order for the works might have been made (s. 238 (1)). This case is therefore in several respects clearly distinguishable from that of British Columbia Elec. Rly. Co. v. Vancouver, Victoria and Eastern Rly. Co.[27] as viewed by their Lordships of the Judicial Committee. With great respect, assuming jurisdiction, the facts that the presence and operation of the Toronto Railway Company at the crossing had very largely contributed to the danger to be removed and that the substituted method of crossing would be distinctly advantageous to it, seem to me most cogent reasons for requiring it to contribute to the cost of making the necessary change.\nIn Ottawa Electric Railway Co. v. City of Ottawa[28], an order similar to that now complained of, made against the Ottawa Electric Railway Company, which happened to be a Dominion corporation, was sustained by this court explicitly on the ground that it was a \"person interested or affected\" within the meaning of s. 47 of the \"Railway Act\" of 1903. Section 47 corresponds to present s. 59. When the Ottawa Electric case was decided s. 238 did not contain the provision enabling the Board to apportion cost now found in s.s. 3. The decision of this court in British Columbia Elec. Rly. Co. v. Vancouver, Victoria and Eastern Rly. Co.27, thats. 59 of the \"Railway Act\" and s. 238 as enacted by 8 & 9 Edw. VII., c. 32, are intra vires of the Dominion Parliament was not affected by the judgment of the Privy Council on the appeal[29].\nWhen apprised that the Toronto Railway Company intended to question the jurisdiction of the Railway Board to order it to bear a portion of the cost of the works at the Avenue Road crossing the Assistant Chief Commissioner thought it proper to supplement a statement made when pronouncing that order, so that\nthe reasons on which (his) judgment rested in regard to the division of cost * * * should be clearly set out.\nHis purpose apparently was to put it beyond doubt that the Board had been actuated by considerations of public protection and safety. That was clearly unnecessary in view of the history of the proceedings which led up to the order being made for separation of grades and approving of the subway scheme and plans, and of passages in them in which the dangerous character of the crossing at Avenue Road had been emphasized. Moreover, by the Board's order of the 12th November, 1914, payment of 20% of the cost of constructing three of the subways (not exceeding $5,000 in any one case) directed in connection with the grade separation scheme in North Toronto, of which the grade separation at Avenue Road formed a part, was authorized to be made out of the railway grade crossing fund established by s. 239 (a) of the \"Railway Act\" (8 & 9 Edw. VII. c. 32). This order could not properly have been made unless the work so aided was for the protection, safety and convenience of the public. The learned Commissioner probably thought it advisable, however, in view of the fact that when making the order for distribution of cost he had specially alluded to the undoubted advantages which the Toronto Railway Company would derive from the substitution of the subway for a level crossing, to state explicitly that the action of the Board in directing that substitution had been influenced by the danger of the existing level crossing. He had referred to the incidental advantages of a subway to the Toronto Railway Company not as a reason for ordering the separation of grades and the construction of the subway but as a ground for imposing 10% of the cost on that company.\nMr. McCarthy objected to these additional reasons being considered and also challenged the accuracy of the allusions in them to an accident at the Queen Street crossing, owing to a tramway overrunning Scotch blocks which were set against it, and to another accident at Front Street. The records of the Railway Commission, produced by Mr. MacMurchy, bore out the statements of the Assistant Chief Commissioner as to both cases. Since the appeal to this court is confined to questions of jurisdiction and of law, I think it desirable that in cases which are to come here we should have full and explicit findings from the Board upon all matters of fact which may become material for our consideration. I can readily understand that in the hurry of disposing of the very numerous cases with which the Railway Board is called upon to deal, commissioners in stating the grounds on which they proceed may omit to advert expressly to facts present to the minds of themselves and the parties before them, but of particular moment only when a question of jurisdiction or of law is actually mooted. I agree with the view expressed by the learned Chief Commissioner, Sir Henry Drayton, that\nnot only has the learned Assistant Chief Commissioner the right to deliver extended reasons for his judgment at any time that he desires, but that it was his duty so to do, in case any pertinent issue had not been covered in his previous reasons. Under the Act, questions of fact have to be disposed of by the Board, and all accessory findings of fact should be made by the Board so as to relieve the Justices of the Supreme Court from the consideration of all issues except the questions of law submitted.\nThe only remaining question is that raised in regard to the effect of paragraphs 13 and 18 of the agreement between the City of Toronto and the Toronto Railway Company whereby, that company contends, the city is obliged to furnish a right of way on its streets for the company's tracks. This provision, it is argued, relieves the company from all liability to contribute to the expense of alterations in the grades of streets. It may be that, as between the parties to it, the agreement entitles the company to indemnification from the city in respect of such cost. On that question of civil rights in the province the Dominion Railway Board was not competent to pass; and of course I express no view. But I find nothing in the agreement which in anywise interferes with the right of the Board to deal with the Toronto Railway Company as a company or person interested in and affected by its order for separation of grades and the construction of a subway at the Avenue Road crossing, or as a corporation on whose complaint or application that order might have been made and as such liable to bear the portion of the cost which the Board has deemed it proper to impose upon it. This was the view taken by this court in the Ottawa case already adverted to (37 Can. S.C.R. 354) of similar clauses in an agreement between the City of Ottawa and the Ottawa Electric Railway Company.\nI would, for these reasons, answer the first question submitted by the Board of Railway Commissioners in the affirmative. To the second and third questions I would answer that I find nothing in the terms of the agreement referred to which precluded the Board making the order requiring the Toronto Railway Company to contribute to the cost of the subway at Avenue Road. The appeal against the jurisdiction of the Board to pronounce that order should be dismissed and the appellant should pay the costs of the respondents. Brodeur J.\u2014I thought at first that the facts of this case were similar to those adjudicated upon in the Vancouver Case[30], but they are so different that I have come to the conclusion that this appeal should be dismissed.\nThe application for a subway was not made by the municipality as in the Vancouver Case30 but the correspondence and the procedure shew that the Board of its own motion inquired into and determined the order complained of.\nIt is not a matter of municipal improvement that the Board acted upon but it was a question of the protection and safety of the public.\nMr. Commissioner McLean in his judgment puts that very clearly when he said:\u2014\nThe work is undoubtedly in the interest of public safety. The element of danger which was manifestly present was attributable not only to the increase of traffic on the railway but also to the increase of traffic on the highways.\nIt is true that the Assistant Chief Commissioner in his first opinion, dated the 5th of May 1914, mentions other grounds to justify the action of the Board, but he states also that the construction of a subway will remove the possibility of the accidents which the level crossing in spite of the protection already existing might render possible.\nThe street railway company became with regard to this crossing under the jurisdiction of the Board when it applied some years ago for a level crossing. The Railway Committee could have directed then that the tracks of the street railway should be carried under the tracks of the railway company (section 227, s.s. 3-6 \"Railway Act\") but it simply granted the application and ordered under the provisions of section 229 the adoption of appliances which were then considered sufficient for the public safety and convenience.\nThe street railway company remained concerning the carrying out of that order under the control and the jurisdiction of the Board and if later on the public interest required some better protection, the construction of a subway, for example, the Board could revise its former order and proceed to determine the condition in which the crossing should take place (28-29-227 \"Railway Act\").\nThe Board was empowered then under s. s. 3 of section 237 or 238 to determine what portion of the cost of the improvement should be borne by the street railway company.\nThe facts disclosed in the present case shew conclusively that the powers exercised are ancillary to the control which the Parliament of Canada has on federal railways.\nFor these reasons the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: McCarthy, Osier, Hoskin and Harcourt.\nSolicitor for the respondent the Can.

Fitzgerald, (1916) 53 S.C.R. 263\nDate: 1916-05-02\nThe Canada Cement Company (Defendants) Appellants;\nand\nJohn Joseph Fitzgerald (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1916: February 25; 1916: May 2.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davis, Idington, Duff and Anglin JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ONTARIO.\nDeed of land reservation\u2014Right of passage\u2014Changed conditions\u2014Object of conveyance.\nF. sold land to the Cement Co., reserving by the deed \u201cthe right to pass over for cattle, etc., for water going to and from Dry Lake.\u201d The company, in using the land for excavating the marl deposit, cut away the shelving bank of Dry Lake and rendered it inaccessible for cattle.\nHeld, Fitzpatrick C.J. dissenting, that cutting away the bank at this place without providing another suitable watering-place with a proper way leading thereto was an unwarranted interference with the rights of F. and the fact that the company purchased the land for the purpose of digging marl did not give them a right to extinguish F.\u2019s easement of passage for his cattle.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1] affirming the judgment at the trial[2] in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe facts are sufficiently stated in the above head-note. The trial judge held that the plaintiff was entitled to a perpetual right of way over the land sold for his cattle to get to water and he sent the case to a referee to ascertain if the defendants could furnish such right of way. In case they could not, plaintiff to have judgment for $1,500 as damages. Tilley K.C. and Northrup K.C. for the appellants.\nMikel K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting).\u2014In the grant by the respondent of part of his farm to the appellant there was the following reservation:\nAnd the said parties of the First Part reserve to themselves, their heirs and assigns forever, the right to use the roadway at present existing across the marl deposit to the Second Concession and the right to pass over for cattle, horses and other domestic farm animals for water going to and from Dry Lake.\nThere was some suggestion that these two rights refer to one and the same thing. I can see nothing to support such a contention. The right with which we are concerned is the second mentioned in the reservation and is entirely distinct from the first right reserved.\nThere was evidence that there was what is called a drift-way, that is a path or track, which was used by the cattle going from the respondent\u2019s farm to water at Dry Lake. The land surrounding the lake was, however, open marsh land and the cattle being at large I doubt if there could be said to be any definite way though possibly the cattle went more or less in the same direction. At any rate there is no suggestion of any such drift-way in the reservation and that in marked contrast to the reservation by the first right of the use of\nthe roadway at present existing across the marl deposit to the Second Concession.\nNow although the respondent tried to avoid answering the question he was obliged to admit that the appellant had not prevented cattle from going from the farm to Dry Lake.\nHis LORDSHIP: Try and answer the question.\nA.\u2014They could walk there Mr. NORTHRUP:\u2014To the shore?\nA.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014There is nothing to prevent your cattle coming from the lane around the head of the dredger to the shore of Dry Lake, whatever that shore is?\nA.\u2014No.\nTherefore it is clear that the appellant has not prevented the respondent\u2019s cattle passing over the lands granted for water going to and from Dry Lake and that is all that the reservation in terms gives a right to.\nThe appellant in pursuance of the purpose for which it purchased these lands excavated the marl in Dry Lake and, instead of the shelving bank with two or three feet of water at which the cattle were accustomed to drink unattended, the water is now so deep at the bank that it would be unsafe to allow them to go there without someone in charge.\nThis is the real grievance of which the respondent complains and it is of something outside and beyond the right of way reserved in the conveyance over the lands granted. Consequently we are not concerned with those innumerable cases which are governed by the well-established principle that\nthe servient owner cannot so deal with the tenement as to render the easement over it incapable of being enjoyed or more difficult of being enjoyed by the dominant owner.\nAgain, I do not think we can consider what was the intention of the respondent in making the grant to the appellant. He is very positive now that he intended to reserve the right to water his cattle as he had previously done. Perhaps he did not then consider the matter so fully as he has since done, for otherwise it must surely have occurred to him that since the purpose for which the appellant was acquiring the property was to excavate the marl some inter- ference with the water must be inevitable, and that he could not expect to sell part of his land for such a purpose and retain the use of it for farm purposes as completely as before. It is not, however, a question of what the respondent intended, but of what he did. There would be no justification for varying the grant even if such intention were clearly shewn for if at the time the appellant had been asked to pay a further $1,500 for the rights it was acquiring it would probably have refused to proceed with the purchase. We can, therefore, only consider what are the legal rights arising as between the parties.\nNow the learned judge at the trial says in his judgment:\nI think the inference is when the right of way was reserved in the second part \u201cThe right to pass over, etc.,\u201d that that involves the inference and suggestion that there should be a place at the end of that right where they (i.e., the cattle) could water in safety.\nIn the first place, I point out that we are not directly concerned here with the difference between an implied grant and an implied reservation. This difference is laid down in the well known case of Wheeldon v. Burrows[3], where Thesiger L.J. states the general rules and says:\nThe first of these rules is that on the grant by the owner of a tenement of part of that tenement as it is then used and enjoyed there will pass to the grantee all those easements which are necessary to the reasonable enjoyment of the property granted and which have been and are at the time of the grant used by the owner of the entirety for the benefit of the part granted. The second is that if the grantor intends to reserve any right over the tenement granted it is his duty to reserve it expressly in the grant. Both of the general rules which I have mentioned are founded upon a maxim which is as well established by authority as it is consonant to reason and common sense, viz., that a grantor shall not derogate from his grant.\nWith this, as I have said, we are not directly concerned because the grantor has made an express reservation and all that we have to do is to find what is the right or the extent of the right so reserved.\nNevertheless it is only by implication or, as the judge says, by \u201cinference and suggestion\u201d that the reservation can be held to bear the extended meaning he places upon it and there seems no reason why the same rule should not apply to an implied extension of a reservation as to the reservation itself. On the face of it, the reservation is of nothing but a limited right of way. It is a right to pass over the lands granted for cattle, horses and other domestic farm animals only and only for water going to and from Dry Lake. The words \u201cfor water\u201d are certainly capable of bearing a purely restrictive meaning. The lands may not be used for pasturing cattle, exercising horses or any other purpose than for water.\nThe reservation of the right of way would be just as proper in the form actually used if Dry Lake had been the property of a third party. If the respondent had then become unable to obtain a continued right to use the lake, not only would the appellant be under no liability, but the right of way over its land would have ceased with the purpose for which it was granted.\nThere is in the grant no reservation of Dry Lake or of any rights in its waters or of convenience of access thereto, yet these are the matters of substance to which the right of way could be only ancillary. If the parties to the conveyance had been agreed as to the reservation of any such rights we should have expected to find that they had been expressly provided for and safeguarded. Had they been so reserved we might in the absence of a grant of right of way have implied one. It is different, however, from the mere grant of a right of way to imply substantive rights which the appellant would probably have refused to concede. Considering the purpose for which the company purchased, a purpose of which the respondent was of course aware, I think it is reasonable to suppose that the right of way was agreed to and has to be taken for what it is worth. If the consequence of the appellant\u2019s workings renders the access to the water more difficult or were to decrease the quantity of the water or otherwise interfere with the respondent\u2019s full enjoyment of the water as he possessed it when he was the owner of the whole property, he has reserved no rights for loss of which he can maintain any claim for damages.\nI do not recall any decided case presenting exactly the same features as the present case, but perhaps some light may be gained by reference to the case of Rhodes v. Bullard,[4].\nIn covenant the plaintiff declared upon a lease by the defendant to the plaintiff of a messuage and a warehouse and also all that part of the yard belonging to the messuage between that and the warehouse. And the defendant covenanted that he would permit the plaintiff to have free ingress, egress and regress through the gate at the bottom of the yard belonging to the messuage to the warehouse and the use of the pump in the said yard jointly with the defendant whilst the same should remain there paying half the expenses of keeping it in repair.\nThe defendant removed the pump unnecessarily and it was held that under the words of the covenant he might do so and consequently the breach was ill assigned. The Chief Justice, Lord Ellenborough, draws attention to the fact that there was no demise of the pump and Grose J. says: It is material to consider that there are no words of demise of the use of the pump; but the lessor covenants that the lessee shall have the use of the pump jointly with himself whilst the same shall remain there, etc.\nNow it is true that the judgment went upon the words of the covenant, but in the present case not only is there no demise of the use of the water in Dry Lake, but there is no covenant either. If a covenant is to be implied at all, is it reasonable that more should be implied than that the respondent should have the use of the water if and so long as and to the extent that the appellant\u2019s workings did not interfere with such use? I think that would be the utmost the respondent could ask.\nFor these reasons I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I agree in dismissing this appeal for the reasons given by Sir William Meredith C.J. in the Appellate Division in delivering the judgment of that court. Those reasons are quite satisfactory to me.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014If the grantees under whom appellant claims title had executed the deed of conveyance in question the reservation of the right of way would then have been construed as a grant by the said grantees to their vendors of the right of way so reserved, as was explained in the case of The Durham and Sunderland Railway Co. v. Walker[5] at p. 967.\nThey do not seem to have executed the conveyance and at common law there might be some difficulty in respondent\u2019s way besides the question of uncertainty relied upon. It seems, however, obviously to have been agreed between the parties that this right of way should be enjoyed by the vendors to serve the user by them of the remaining part of the farm.\nIn the case of May v. Belleville[6], Mr. Justice Buckley held the successors in title of the vendees had not signed the deed but their agent had signed the agreement for sale which provided for the right of way. The deed of conveyance there as here contained the reservation of the right of way. The learned judge seems to have held this to be notice of the agreement and the successor in title bound thereby.\nThe conveyance in question herein seems to me, by its numerous provisions in the way of agreements between the parties for several other contingencies relative to the lands in question and rights in or over them, peculiarly to lend itself to such a mode of judicial treatment of the same and all it contains bearing upon this question of right of way.\nFounding the respondent\u2019s claim upon his rights to relief in equity I see no difficulty in applying the law as held in the May Case6. In principle I cannot distinguish the cases. It is true that in that case there was an antecedent agreement but does that do more than open the inquiry?\nAnd in this case where there are so many collateral agreements contained in the conveyance, can there be any doubt of the fact? I admit it seems assumed by both parties rather than expressly proven, but should they be driven back to try over again what they do not seem to dispute?\nMoreover there is this to be said for that manner of looking at the case, that it lets in the power of the court, perhaps in a way otherwise difficult to maintain, to deal with the question in the way it has been dealt with by providing for an inquiry as to another way being found.\nAs to the difficult question of certainty I think it might be fairly arguable, if we had no other evidence than the somewhat indefinite and ambiguous language of the reservation in the deed, that it was void for uncertainty. But when, as must be in the case of such documents, that language is interpreted and construed in light of the evidence of surrounding facts and circumstances existent at the time of the execution of the deed, and the conduct of the parties thereto immediately after such execution, there cannot be any doubt of what it means.\nI think strictly speaking the respondent was entitled to continue using, as he had been before the deed, the right of way defined by that actual user; and that appellant had no right by constructing a railway or in course of mining to excavate that part of the land habitually trodden, and so to impair or obstruct the use thereof. The deed is not as definite as it might have been but the cattle seem to have done, of their necessities and long practice, that which roughly marked the path intended.\nThe contentions of appellant, as to travel by the other way defined being meant, seem to me absurd if any meaning is to be given the words used. They were entirely unnecessary if only the first way defined to the highway was that intended for the cattle to follow.\nThe appellant seems to have got by the judgment appealed from such relief as may ameliorate its situation, perhaps due to the improvidence of its predecessors in title.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs. DUFF J.\u2014The appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The defendant appeals from a judgment of the Ontario Appellate Division, which affirmed the judgment of Falconbridge C.J. the trial judge, declaring the plaintiff entitled to a right of passage across the defendant\u2019s land for cattle on his farm going to and from Dry Lake for the purpose of watering, granting a reference to enable the defendant to indicate a suitable right of way, and if one can be given to assess damages for interim wrongful interference, or, if none can be given, fixing the damages for permanent deprivation at $1,500.\nThe plaintiff sold the lands held to be servient to Messrs. Irwin and Hopper, from whom the defendant acquired them. The deed to Irwin and Hopper contained this clause:\u2014\nThe said parties of the first part reserve to themselves, their heirs and assigns forever, the right to use the roadway at present existing across the marl deposit to the second concession and the right to pass over for cattle, horses and other domestic farm animals for water going to and from Dry Lake.\nThis deed was not executed by the grantees.\nAs an admission upon a matter of law, the statement of counsel for the appellant at the trial that \u201cthe title of the plaintiff to the right of way is not in question\u201d may not bind it. But, disregarding that admission, the plaintiff\u2019s title is, in my opinion, fully established.\nApplying the ordinary rule of construction that, if possible, effect should be given to every word of a document, the language of the deed itself makes it clear that the right of passage to and from Dry Lake for cattle, etc., asserted in this action is distinct from\nthe right to use the roadway at present existing across the marl deposit to the second concession. To the plaintiff\u2019s objection that the reservation relied upon is ineffectual, because a right of way can be created only by grant and Irwin and Hopper did not execute the conveyance to them from the plaintiff, the judgment of Buckley J. in May v. Belleville[7], at p. 612, gives a convincing answer.\nThe fact that the location and width of the passage to Dry Lake over the land conveyed were not defined in the deed did not render it void for uncertainty. Deacon v. South-Eastern Railway Co.[8] Whether the owners of the servient land had the right to assign the way where they could best spare it or the holder of the easement had the right to take it where most convenient for his purpose (Gale on Easements, 8th ed., p. 510; Norton on Deeds, p. 263; Packer v. Wellsted[9], at p. 111), as the Chief Justice of Ontario points out, citing Pearson v. Spencer[10], a well-defined way across the land conveyed having been used by cattle from the plaintiff\u2019s farm in going to and returning from Dry Lake for many years before and after the grant to Irwin and Hopper, the plaintiff\u2019s right to that particular way was probably established. But, as the learned Chief Justice says, the judgment at the trial has recognized the appellant\u2019s right to assign any other passage way over its land which will serve the purpose intended, and of that the respondent does not complain.\nThat the taking away of the bank of Dry Lake at the place where the cattle had been accustomed to water without providing another suitable watering place with a proper way or passage leading to it was an unwarranted interference with the plaintiff\u2019s right is unquestionable. The right accorded to the defendant by the judgment of assigning to the plaintiff some suitable way other than that formerly used and more convenient and less prejudicial to its mining operations is probably something to which it was not entitled. The further claim, that the fact that the land owned by it was to his knowledge purchased from the plaintiff by its predecessors in order to dig marl from it, gives the defendant the right in so digging to extinguish the plaintiff\u2019s easement of passage for his cattle, is so utterly in derogation of the grant of that easement, which the terms of the conveyance to its predecessors in title shew that they undertook to make,\u2014a bargain which equity will enforce, May v. Belleville[11] at p. 612\u2014that the mere statement of it proves it to be untenable. The contention that the use by the cattle on the plaintiff\u2019s farm of other drinking places, not constantly but from time to time, involved an abandonment by the plaintiff of the right of passage to Dry Lake, is equally hopeless.\nThe appeal, in my opinion, fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Northrup & Ponton.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Mikel, Stewart & Baalim.\n[1] 9 Ont.

VII., ch. 150, with power to hold, maintain and operate the railway of the S.S. Ry. Co. and became vested with the franchises and property of that railway company which had been sold in virtue of the statute, 4 & 5 Edw. VII., ch. 158. The S.S. Ry. Co. had constructed 6\u00bd miles of its railway, between Yamaska and St. Francis River, for which it had not received subsidy aid as authorized by 62 & 63 Vict., ch. 7, and, by 7 & 8 Edw. VII., ch. 63, in lieu of the aid provided by the former statutes, subsidy was authorized to be paid to any company completing the construction of 70 miles of the railway from Yamaska on a location which included the 6\u00bd miles of railway so constructed. Under the authority of this legislation the Crown and the appellant company entered into a supplementary agreement fixing the subsidy for the construction of this 70 miles of railway. The company completed the unconstructed portion of the railway and claimed subsidy for the whole length of the line including the 6\u00bd miles acquired in virtue of the sale authorized by 4 & 5 Edw. VII., ch. 158.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada (15 Ex. C.R. 237), Idington J. dissenting, that the undertaking of the company to construct the railway was satisfied whether it actually constructed the whole line itself or purchased a constructed portion thereof to form part of the subsidized line; that the statute 7 & 8 Edw. VII., authorizing the subsidy together with the supplementary contract with the Crown constituted an obligation binding on the Crown and the company was, consequently, entitled to the amount of the subsidy applicable to the 6\u00bd miles of the railway in question. APPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], dismissing the suppliants' petition of right with costs.\nThe circumstances in which the claim for subsidy was made are stated in the head-note.\nB\u00e9ique K.C. and Aim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. for the appellants.\nF. J. Laverty K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal ought to be allowed.\nThe appellant had the usual subsidy contract with the Crown for the construction of a line of railway 70 miles in length. It utilized for the purpose of this line 6\u00bd miles of the South Shore Railway, which it had previously purchased. If the purchase of these 6\u00bd miles had been made subsequent to the contract and for the express purpose of forming part of the subsidized line I do not understand how any question could have arisen as to the right of the appellant to the proportion of the subsidy attributable to the 6\u00bd miles so purchased; I cannot see what difference it makes that the purchase was made before the subsidy contract was entered into. It seems to me that the undertaking to construct a railway is equally satisfied whether the company actually construct the whole line or purchase a portion of it ready made. The Government itself in satisfaction of its statutory and contractual liability to construct the National Transcontinental Railway has recently purchased a short line of railway to form part of that line.\nThe Government is not being asked to pay any subsidy twice over. Parliament was willing to grant a subsidy for a particular 70 miles of railroad and that is all the Government is being asked to pay. No doubt, the subsidy to the South Shore Railway having lapsed, advantage might have been taken to obtain for the country the 6\u00bd miles of road that that company had constructed, without giving any subsidy in respect of this length. Parliament might have offered, in 1908, a subsidy for only 63\u00bd miles, the portion left uncompleted by the South Shore Railway Co. That however is not what was done by the legislature or the Government. Provision was made for a subsidy for the whole 70 miles of railroad and the Crown entered into the usual subsidy contract with the appellant for this line. The appellants had already purchased 6\u00bd miles of road which they could utilize as part of the line and they duly constructed the remainder so as to form a complete line of 70 miles in length as called for by the statute and the contract. I can see no valid reason under these circumstances why the courts should interfere and insist that the appellant is not to be paid the subsidy which Parliament provided and the Crown agreed to grant them.\nFor the debts of the South Shore Railway Co. it is not contended that the appellant is liable. The Intercolonial Railway had properly proved its claim in the liquidation of the South Shore Railway Co. and been collocated for its dividend. With that claim the appellant is in no way concerned.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014The appellant was incorporated in 1906, by 6 Edw. VII., ch. 150, wherein it was recited that the franchises, railway and property of the Quebec Southern Railway, as comprising the railways theretofore known as the South Shore Railway, the United Counties Railway and East Richelieu Valley Railway, had been sold pursuant to the provisions of chapter 158 of the statutes of 1905 and had been purchased by the Honourable Frederic L. B\u00e9ique and that the purchaser bought and became vested with the said franchises, railway and property for the purposes of holding, maintaining and operating the said railway, its property and appurtenances, and that it was expedient to incorporate a company with all the powers and privileges necessary for the said purposes.\nSection 7 of said Act is as follows:\u2014\n7. The company may acquire the railway mentioned in the preamble, and upon and after such acquisition the franchises rights and privileges heretofore possessed by the South Shore Railway Company and the Quebec Southern Railway Company shall vest in and may be exercised and enjoyed by the company, and the company may thereupon hold, maintain and operate the said railway.\nThe railway property bought at the sale referred to in the recital was transferred to the company thus incorporated, pursuant to said section 7.\nSection 8 of said Act is as follows:\u2014\n8. The company may complete the railway which, by the statutes relating to the South Shore Railway Company, the latter was authorized to construct, or any portion thereof, within five years from the date of the passing of this Act; Provided that as to so much thereof as is not completed within that period the power to complete the said railway shall cease and determine.\nThis section, let it be observed, authorizes the completion of the work begun by the South Shore Railway Company but says nothing of the subsidies by which in part it had been built.\nThe said company had reaped some subsidies but failed to earn others and all it might have in that regard. All possible claims in law which that company could conceivably have were thus put aside long before the Act I am about to refer to was enacted.\nBy 7 & 8 Edw. VII., ch. 63, intituled\nan Act to authorize the granting of subsidies in aid of the construction of the lines of railway therein mentioned,\nit was enacted, by section 1, as follows:\u2014\n1. The Governor-in-Council may grant a subsidy of $3,200 per mile towards the construction of each of the undermentioned lines of railway (not exceeding in any case the number of miles hereinafter respectively stated) which shall not cost more on the average than $15,000 per mile for the mileage subsidized, and towards the construction of each of the said lines of railway, not exceeding the mileage hereinafter stated, which shall cost more on the average than $15,000 per mile for the mileage subsidized, a further subsidy beyond the sum of $3,200 per mile of fifty per cent. on so much of the average cost of the mileage subsidized as is in excess of $15,000 per mile, such subsidy not exceeding in the whole the sum of $6,400 per mile.\nThere were 72 different enterprises subsidized by that section, and of these the appellant claims to recover, under item 14, which is as follows:\u2014\n14. For aline of railway from Yamaska to a point in the County of Lotbini\u00e8re, in lieu of the subsidy granted by chapter 57 of 1903, section 2, item 12, not exceeding 70 miles; and for a line of railway from Mount Johnson to St. Gr\u00e9goire station, in lieu of the subsidy granted to the United Counties Railway Company by chapter 7 of 1899, section 2, item 16, for 1 mile, not exceeding 1\u00bd miles; and not exceeding in all 71\u00bd miles.\nThe first part of the foregoing is what I think appellant bases its rights upon.\nThe subsidy granted by ch. 57 of the statute of 1903, sec. 2, item 12, is as follows:\u2014\n2. The Governor-in-Council may grant a subsidy of $3,200 per mile towards the construction of each of the undermentioned lines of railway (not exceeding in any case the number of miles hereinafter respectively stated) which shall not cost more on the average than $15,000 per mile for the mileage subsidized, and towards the construction of each of the said lines of railway not exceeding the mileage hereinafter stated, which shall cost more on the average than $15,000 per mile for the mileage subsidized, a further subsidy beyond the sum of $3,200 per mile of fifty per cent. on so much of the average cost of the mileage subsidized as is in excess of $15,000 per mile, such subsidy not exceeding in the whole the sum of $6,400 per mile.\n12. For a line of railway from Yamaska to Lotbini\u00e8re, a distance not exceeding 70 miles, in lieu of the subsidy granted by item 27 of section 2 of chapter 7 of 1899.\nItem 27 just referred to of section 2, chapter 7, statute of 1899, had been granted as follows:\u2014\n2. The Governor-in-Council may grant a subsidy of $3,200 per mile towards the construction of each of the undermentioned lines of railway (not exceeding in any case the number of miles hereinafter respectively stated) which shall not cost more on the average than $15,000 per mile, for the mileage subsidized, and towards the construction of each of the said lines of railway not exceeding the mileage hereinafter stated, which shall cost more on the average than $15,000 per mile for the mileage subsidized, a further subsidy beyond the sum of $3,200 per mile of fifty per cent. on so much of the average cost of the mileage subsidized as is in excess of $.15,000 per mile, such subsidy not exceeding in the whole the sum of $6,400 per mile.\nThen follow 51 items, covered thereby, of which No. 27 is as follows:\u2014\n27. To the South Shore Railway Company, from Sorel Junction along the South Shore to Lotbini\u00e8re, Quebec, ;a distance not exceeding 82 miles.\nSuch are the terms of the statutory authority upon which appellant's claim rests.\nThey cannot be enlarged by any order-in-council or agreement professing to execute the purpose expressed in such enactments.\nThese subsidies granted to the South Shore Railway Company had failed to be as productive to it, as they might have been, by reason of its failure to earn same by the formal compliance with the language of the statute.\nThere was nothing in law owing that company when appellant acquired its assets and nothing due it by virtue of equity or any equitable considerations which could in law or common sense be assumed to have passed to appellant. By virtue of such acquisition under and by virtue of the purchase of the assets of a bankrupt company, the appellant neither by express terms nor any implication involved in that transaction could pretend it had any moral or legal right to pose as the builder of that part of the road in fact built by the company whose assets it bought.\nThe terms of the enactment expressed in the grant clearly mean what they say and that is\na subsidy of $3,200 per mile towards the construction of each of the undermentioned lines of railway.\nIf, using the very illustration put forward in argument by Mr. B\u00e9ique, the appellant had for any good reason discarded the six-and-one-half miles now in question herein, and then already constructed by the bankrupt company, and constructed seventy miles of railway, it would have been competent for the Governor-in-Council to have recognized such a claim.\nOr if for any valid reason it had been found necessary to diverge from the straight line and construct seventy miles of railway between the termination of that already constructed and an agreed point in the County of Lotbini\u00e8re, it might also be competent for the Governor-in-Council to have recognized such a claim.\nThese suggestions or surmises cannot go far in helping us to interpret and construe this statute but we must recognize the world in which we live and what is apt to transpire therein or we will never correctly interpret anything, not even a statute.\nOne is reminded, in considering this class of legislation, of the language of Lord Cairns when speaking of a somewhat analogous sort of legislation, he said in The Directors of East London Railway Co. v. White-church[2], at p. 89:\u2014\nWe all know how these clauses are inserted in an Act of Parliament of this kind. They are in the nature of private arrangements put into the Act at the instance of particular parties, who either act with greater caution than other parties, or act with a desire to make a better bargain for themselves than other parties have made. They are not put in by the legislature as part of a general scheme of legislation which it desires to express, but they are in the nature of particular contracts, and ought not to have any effect upon the construction of a general clause such as that which I have read to your Lordships.\nI think we must realize that each item following each of these clauses we are concerned with herein may have been the result of much bargaining. And the curious features I have adverted to render some things therein ambiguous. I think in principle these ambiguities must be resolved against the appellant.\nFor such or other like reasons it is quite conceivable seventy miles of railway might have been agreed upon as within the phrase \"towards the construction\" of a railway but it is not within the purview of the Act to give a subsidy for anything that had been already constructed, by someone else who is not to obtain directly or indirectly the benefit, or any part of the benefit, of such a grant.\nThe words \"in lieu of the subsidy granted by chapter 57 of 1903\" etc., cannot override the obvious purpose of the legislation (which was to secure the construction of seventy miles of railway) and thereby make a pure gift to appellant for something it had no claim to either in law or equity. The moral or equitable obligations to and claims of the bankrupt company or its creditors for that granted by said Act of 1903, in regard to the construction of six-and- a-half miles of railway, could not be thus compounded or compensated for by juggling of words in this fashion. No one can properly impute to Parliament the crass stupidity of imagining it was thus compensating the bankrupt company or its creditors of whom respondent was one by granting to appellant which had not fallen heir to, or done anything entitling it to reap such compensation.\nIt is to be observed also that the language is materially changed from that used in the two previous grants. In the first it was \"from Sorel * * * to Lotbini\u00e8re.\" In this it is \"from Yamaska to a point in the County of Lotbini\u00e8re.\" Why was the change made? At whose instance? The enacting clause in each statute quoted above uses identical language, yet when it comes to the description of what the appellant urges is identically the same thing the language is changed. Why again I ask? Had someone knowing the facts pointed out that absolute identity would produce a wrong (in short an imposition on the country) by applying the subsidy to those six-and-a-half miles, and was the language then adroitly or stupidly, or both, amended as we see?\nAgain it clearly could not have been intended to be under the facts literally \"in lieu of the subsidy granted by chapter 57 of 1903, etc.\" for the obvious reason that the donee, evidently intended to be aided thereunder, had by virtue of the Act of Parliament passed in 1905 been put out of existence. And the variation of the language I have just referred to could hardly have been so changed merely through inadvertence. Yet the change, if convenient to resort to now, surely was not designedly intended.\nReliance is however placed upon the two agreements made between the respondent and the appellant. The second I will not trouble with, for it is but a modification and adoption of the first.\nThe first of these is dated 25th February, 1909, and begins its recitals by the following:\u2014\nWhereas the company was authorized to build the railway hereinafter mentioned by the Act or Acts following, namely:\u2014Canada, 1906, Chapter 150.\nThere follow this recital of alleged facts I have already dealt with and the last recital is as follows:\u2014\nAND WHEREAS the company has established to the satisfaction of the Governor-in-Council its ability to construct and complete the said railway; and the granting of the said subsidy to the company has been approved by the Governor-in-Council as will appear by reference to the order-in-council above referred to.\nThe first of these clearly contemplated a building of a railway and the last the construction and completion of a railway.\nThis language is strangely inapt for the purpose of expressing a bargain or agreement for the subsidizing in favour of the appellant which was a company that had no existence when the six-and-a-half miles of railway now in question had been constructed, if in fact that six-and-a-half miles was within the contemplation of the parties.\nAgain the first clause of the agreement is as follows:\u2014\n1. That the company shall well, truly and faithfully make, build, construct and complete the line of railway mentioned and described in paragraph 14 of the first section of the \"Subsidy Act,\" as above set forth and recited, and all bridges, culverts, works and structures appertaining thereto, in all respects in accordance with the specifications hereto annexed marked \"A,\" or with such amendments thereof as may from time to time during the progress of the said work be approved by the Governor-in-Council.\nThe six-and-a-half miles for which the subsidy is now claimed and this suit is brought had been built long before appellant had any existence. How can it pretend to recover under a contract, so framed, for a subsidy that it had never earned yet so expressly given only for building 70 miles of railway and claim as part of it six-and-a-half miles of railway it never built and never in fact intended to build?\nI cannot understand how this contract helps appellant. Nor can I understand why or how if the building of six miles and a half done by the predecessor in title was honestly believed to be a righteous foundation for an agreement for the payment of a railway subsidy in respect of the said six miles and a half, there was found so much difficulty in expressing the fact both in the recitals and in the operative clause I have quoted from.\nThey seem to coincide with the interpretation I have put upon the Act.\nThe resorting to such language as used is quite inconsistent with the interpretation now set up as a foundation for the claim herein.\nIt reduces the meaning of the ambiguous language used in item 14 of the \"Subsidy Act\" to the obvious purport of it when read in the light of the surrounding facts and circumstances as intended to cover so much of the part of the line indicated as in fact needed to be built by the appellant but in no event to exceed seventy miles so built.\nThere was a claim set up by the respondent's servants that if there was any grant due in respect of these six-and-a-half miles it was to the railway company which had built same and in that case the respondent was entitled to receive the benefit thereof as a creditor of that railway company.\nOn the facts before us that suggestion may not be in law maintainable but it expresses a thought which might well have been given expression to as in line with if not exactly in accord with what has been acted upon.\nParliament no doubt has revived and re-voted subsidies many times to the company building a railway and failing to complete it within the time specified, and possibly has considered or should have considered creditors of an embarrassed company in such a case. If this had been expressed as its purpose herein perhaps no one would have complained. But what right had appellant to claim to reap that which might righteously have been given for such a purpose but could not, without doing an exceptionally unrighteous thing, be given to the appellant?\nIt is to be observed that though \"appellant made its claim on the 17th May, 1909, unsuccessfully and the position of the Crown officers was reiterated in another form in February, 1910, yet it was only after three years' deliberation and consideration it summoned courage to assert the claim herein by the petition of right herein and then boldly claimed therein that it had in fact built that which it never built.\nI am unable to hold that buying and building are identical and convertibly equivalent terms.\nI think it matters not what the orders-in-council disclose if my interpretation and construction of the statute and the agreement, or of either, is maintainable.\nTherefore I shall not confuse what I have tried to make plain by an analysis of what seem to me to have been results of inadvertence and could not in my view bind respondent.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014The appeal should be allowed with costs. Anglin J.\u2014The statute of 1906, chap. 150, which incorporated the suppliant company recited the sale by the Exchequer Court of the franchises, railway and property of the Quebec Southern Railway, comprising inter alia the South Shore Railway, to the Honourable Frederic L. B\u00e9ique, and authorized the suppliant company to acquire and complete the said railway. At that time about 18\u00bc miles of the 82 miles of railway from Sorel Junction to Lotbini\u00e8re, which the South Shore Railway Company had been authorized to construct, had been completed\u201412 miles from Sorel to Yamaska and about 6\u00bc miles from Yamaska to the St. Francis River. The South Shore Railway Co. had received the subsidy for the 12 miles section, but no subsidy had been paid for the 6\u00bc miles. On the 20th Jan., 1902, the Government inspecting-engineer reported the completion of the 6\u00bc miles from Yamaska to St. Francis River by the Quebec Southern Railway Company. In a report of the 31st January, 1908, he repeated that statement adding:\u2014\nNo subsidy was paid, however, the completed section being less than (10) ten miles in length.\n(62 & 63 V., ch. 7, sec. 7.) It is only reasonable to suppose that Parliament was cognizant of these facts when, during the session of 1908 (7 & 8 Edw. VII., ch. 63, sec. 1, item 14), it authorized the grant of a subsidy for 70 miles of railway \"from Yamaska to a point in the County of Lotbini\u00e8re\"\u2014the balance of the 82 miles which were to have been built by the South Shore Railway Company (for which a subsidy had been first authorized in 1899 by item 27 of section 2 of chapter 7), excluding the 12 miles from Sorel Junction to Yamaska for which the subsidy had been paid to the South Shore Railway Company, but including the 6\u00bc miles from Yamaska to the St. Francis River built by the South Shore Railway Company for which no subsidy had been paid. The subsidy of 1908 is expressly granted\nin lieu of the subsidy granted by chapter 57 of 1903, section 2, item 12,\nwhich in turn had been granted,\nin lieu of the subsidy granted by item 27 of section 2 of chapter 7 of 1899.\nUnder the authority of this legislation a subsidy contract (25th, Feb., 1909), and a supplementary contract (17th Dec, 1909), fixing the amount of the subsidy under section 10 (7 & 8 Edw. VII., ch. 63), for 70 miles from Yamaska to a point in the County of Lotbini\u00e8re, were duly entered into between the suppliant company and His Majesty the King, represented by the Minister of Railways.\nThe Government officials, however, withheld payment of $26,765.45 of the subsidy payable to the suppliant company on the ground that that sum was due to the Crown in respect of traffic balances between the Intercolonial Railway and the South Shore Railway prior to the sale of the latter by the Exchequer Court. In answer to the petition of right claiming this balance of $26,765.45 the Crown, by its statement of defence, also takes the position that the petitioner is not entitled to any subsidy in respect of the 6\u00bc miles of railway built by the South Shore Railway Company.\nThe learned assistant-judge of the Exchequer Court held that the Crown was not entitled to set off or compensation in respect of the traffic balance due the Intercolonial Railway because the sale to the Quebec Southern Railway had been made free of all charges, liens and incumbrances, and the subsidy in question is claimed by the suppliant not as assignee of the rights of that company\u2014its rights thereto having in fact lapsed, under the terms of its subsidy contract, owing to the non-completion of the undertaking within the time stipulated\u2014but by virtue of the statute of 1908 and the contracts of 1909 above mentioned. Neither in their factum nor at bar in this court did counsel for the Crown controvert this holding of the learned trial judge. They rest their case in support of the judgment dismissing the petition of right on the ground, held in their favour in the Exchequer Court, that the suppliant company is not entitled to any subsidy in respect of the 6\u00bc miles from Yamaska to the St. Francis River because it did not actually construct that part of the railway, and also on an alleged estoppel arising out of the fact that the company had retained and cashed a cheque for $43,414.55 tendered it by the Crown as a balance due after deducting the Intercolonial Railway claim of $26,761.45.\nAs to the latter point the evidence shews that the cheque was cashed only after the company had protested against the deduction and had received some assurance from the Railway Department that the cashing of it would not prejudice its rights in regard to payment of the sum withheld. Under these circumstances the retention and cashing of the cheque affords no evidence of intent on the part of the company to abandon any right it might have to payment of the sum withheld. It does not raise an estoppel. Day v. McLea[3].\nIt is quite within the power of Parliament, if it should see fit to do so, to authorize the grant of a subsidy for a portion of a railway already constructed by others to a company which assumes the burden of completing the undertaking. There is no reason to suppose that when the statute of 1908 was passed authorizing the payment of a subsidy in respect of a line of railway 70 miles long from Yamaska to a point in the County of Lotbini\u00e8re, in lieu of a subsidy previously granted which had lapsed, Parliament was not fully aware that the Quebec Southern Railway Company had, before 1902, actually constructed 6\u00bc miles of the 70 miles from Yamaska to a point in the County of Lotbini\u00e8re and that that 6\u00bc miles sold by the Exchequer Court had been acquired by the Quebec, Montreal and Southern Railway Co. under the express authority conferred by its Act of incorporation and formed part of the 70 miles in respect of which Parliament was then asked to authorize the payment of a subsidy. On the contrary, from the evidence afforded by its own statutes there is reason to believe that Parliament knew these facts and that, with that knowledge, it meant to authorize the payment to the Quebec, Montreal and Southern Railway Co. of a subsidy in respect of the 6\u00bc miles now in question. The contract and supplementary contract converted that authorization into a contractual obligation on the part of the Crown and, in my opinion, gave to the suppliant company, on completion of its undertaking, a right to payment according to the terms of those contracts which it is entitled to enforce by petition of right in the Exchequer Court.\nI would, for these reasons, allow this appeal. The appellant should have its costs throughout.\nBrodeur J.\u2014This is a petition of right by which the suppliant (now the appellant) seeks to enforce the payment of a railway subsidy authorized by statute and provided for in the subsidy agreement between the Crown and the appellant.\nIt had been considered of public interest that a railway should be built on the south shore of the St. Lawrence from Sorel Junction to Lotbini\u00e8re, a distance of 82 miles.\nIn 1899 a subsidy of $3,200 per mile had been granted by Parliament for the construction of that railway to the South Shore Railway Company.\nThe latter company started to build from Sorel Junction to the Yamaska River, a distance of 12 miles, and then from Yamaska to St. Francis River, a distance of 6\u00bd miles.\nThe Government paid, in 1902, for the 12 miles covering the distance between Sorel and Yamaska but, as the section of the road from Yamaska to St. Francis was less than 10 miles, no subsidy was paid for the 6\u00bd miles built.\nOne of the conditions of the grant was that the railway should be completed before the 1st of September, 1903, and, as that condition had not been fulfilled, Parliament in 1903 renewed the subsidy in the the following terms:\u2014\nfor a line of railway from Yamsaka to Lotbini\u00e8re, a distance not exceeding 70 miles, in lieu of the subsidy granted by item 27 of sec. 2 of ch. 7 of 1899.\nThe Minister of Railways who introduced that legislation knew that a part of the railway subsidized in 1899 had been built, namely from Sorel to St. Francis River, but as the payment of the subsidy had been made only for the section between Sorel and Yamaska he had Parliament to renew the subsidy from Yamaska to Lotbini\u00e8re, a distance of 70 miles.\nIt is to be noticed also that this subsidy is not payable to the South Shore Railway Co., as provided by the Act of 1899, but to any company. That is likely due to the fact that changes were being made with regard to the ownership of the railway.\nBy an Act passed in 1900 by the Provincial Legislature a new company called the Quebec Southern Railway Company had been incorporated with power to acquire the railways of the United Counties Railway Company and the East Richelieu Valley Railway Company and with power to amalgamate the latter railways with the South Shore Railway.\nThe amalgamation took place; but on account of difficulties, mostly financial, a receiver was appointed and, in 1905, Parliament authorized the sale of the railway.\nThe sale took place through the Exchequer Court and the registrar sold to the new company which was formed, which is now the appellant company, on the 4th January, 1907, the property of the South Shore Railway Co., together with all and singular rights-of-way, improvements, franchises and property of every kind of the said company including\nsubsidies and privileges in connection with said railways, excepting, however, the subsidy granted by the Quebec Government in connection with the Yamaska and the St. Francis bridges.\nIn 1908, Parliament renewed the subsidy which had been voted in 1903 in the following words:\u2014\nfor a line of railway from Yamaska to a point in the County of Lotbini\u00e8re in lieu of the subsidy granted by chapter 57, 1903, section 2, item 12, not exceeding 70 miles'.\nIt is pretty evident, by this new legislation, that Parliament intended to give a subsidy not only from St. Francis River but also from the Yamaska River in order to cover the part which had been built for some years. The Governor-in-Council was empowered by the \"Subsidy Act\" to make a subsidy agreement with any company which would build the railway between Yamaska and Lotbini\u00e8re and, as the appellant company was the only one authorized at the time to build a railway in that locality, a subsidy agreement was passed between the appellant company and the Government by which a subsidy would be paid to them from Yamaska to Lotbini\u00e8re.\nThe Government paid from time to time subsidies which covered the six miles built by the South Shore Railway Co.\nThe Government then considered the contract and the \"Subsidy Act\" as covering that section which had been built by the South Shore Railway Company.\nIt is claimed now by the Government that the \"Subsidy Act\" contemplated a railway to be built and not one already built.\nIt seems to me that such a construction could not be put on the Act and on the agreement. It was well known at the time by the Department, it was in evidence in 1903 and in 1908 that the section of the railway between Yamaska and St. Francis had been built. However, the Minister of Railways asked Parliament that a subsidy should be paid for not from St. Francis River but from Yamaska.\nWhen the matter was before Parliament, there was also some discussion as to subsidized railways being partially built (p. 13482 Debates, 1907-8). So it seems to me very clear from the language of the statute and from the language of the subsidy agreement that Parliament intended to vote a subsidy not only for the section to be built but for the part which had already been constructed.\nIt is claimed further by the respondent that the authority to grant a subsidy under the statute is not mandatory but purely discretionary; and the cases of The Hereford Railway Company v. The Queen[4], De Galindez v. The King[5]; Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. The King[6], are quoted in support of that contention.\nIt is to be noticed that in those cases the action was based on the statute and not on the contract and subsidy agreement passed between the Government and a railway company.\nI fully recognize that the Governor-in-Council would be absolutely within its discretion in refusing to pass any contract with the appellant company; but when they decide to pass such a contract, when they have exercised, their discretion, then the contract and the statute become binding on the Crown and the Crown is obliged to carry out the obligation which it contains, the same way as the railway company is obliged also to carry out the obligation therein contained; otherwise, it would be rather serious that the company would undertake under such agreement to construct a railway and, when the time would come to make the payment, that the Government could say: Well, we are not bound to pay you.\nI may say further that that question was raised in the case of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Co. v. The King before the Privy Council[7], and the learned counsel for the Government claimed in his factum that it is open to the Government to evade their liability by refusing to come to an agreement or abstaining from coming to an agreement; but those representing the Government did not think it advisable to argue it before the Privy Council and Lord Macnaghten, at page 210, suggests that the point did not commend itself very much to him.\nFor these reasons, I think the Government must pay the railway subsidy which the company appellant seeks to recover from the Government and that the judgment of the Exchequer Court dismissing the petition should be reversed.\nIt is recommended that the Crown should pay the costs of this court and the court below.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: B\u00e9ique & B\u00e9ique.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Blair, Laverty & Hale.\n[1] 15 Ex.

The application for the insurance did not refer to them but contained a condition that the insured, should not use coal oil stoves on the premises insured. At the time the premises were destroyed by fire coal oil was kept and stored there in excess of the quantity permitted by clause 10 of the statutory conditions, without written permission of the insurance company. The company had given no written notice to the insured pointing out particulars wherein the policy might differ from the application as provided by the second clause of the conditions.\nHeld, Brodeur J. dissenting, that the law did not require the statutory conditions to be referred to in applications for insurance; that all applications for insurance to which the Quebec legislation applies must be deemed to be made subject to those conditions, except as varied under articles 7035 and 7036, Revised Statutes of Quebec, 1909, and that there was no necessity for the insurance company to give notice, as mentioned in the second clause of the conditions, calling the attention of the insured to the conditions indorsed upon the policy of insurance.\nPer curiam.\u2014Knowledge by an agent soliciting insurance that coal oil, in large quantities, was kept and stored upon the premises to be insured does not constitute notice of that fact to the company insuring them, nor does notice that coal oil in such quantities was kept and stored upon the premises prior to the insurance involve knowledge that it would be kept there afterwards in violation of the conditions of the policy. Fitzpatrick C.J., held that knowledge by the agent was knowledge of the company but was not equivalent to waiver of the condition of the policy respecting the keeping or storing of coal oil.\nIn the absence of proof that adjusting agents employed by the insurer had authority to dispose of the matter, the offer of settlement of the claim by the adjuster does not constitute waiver on the part of the insurer of objections which might be urged against theclaim.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, reversing the judgment of Pouliot J., at the trial, in the Superior Court, District of Arthabaska, and dismissing the plaintiff's action with costs.\nThe circumstances of the case are stated in the head-note and the questions in issue on the present appeal are set forth in the judgments now reported.\nG. G. Stuart K.C. and Cr\u00e9peau K.C. for the appellant.\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. and Perrault K.C. for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice :\u2014At the close of the argument I was under the impression that the plaintiff, appellant, was fairly entitled to succeed. But a careful examination of the pleadings and evidence, documentary and oral, leads me irresistibly, if regretfully, to a contrary conclusion.\nThe action is brought to recover the amount due under a policy of insurance on a stock of goods in a country store in the Province of Quebec. There is no doubt that the goods covered by the policy were destroyed by fire on the 25th November, 1913. The company sets up by way of defence every objection that the ingenuity of counsel could suggest and the plaintiff is entitled at least to the benefit of my opinion that his claim was made honestly and he fails to succeed on a ground which involves neither moral nor legal turpitude.\nThe action was maintained in the Superior Court, but on appeal it was held that there was a breach of the condition in the policy which forbade the keeping and storing on the premises of coal oil in quantities exceeding five gallons without the permission in writing of the company and on that ground the action was dismissed. In my opinion that judgment must be affirmed.\nI am satisfied that the insured was in complete ignorance of the statute when he applied for the insurance and it does not appear that his attention was ever drawn to the condition now invoked after the policy came into his possession. He acted throughout in perfect good faith and frankly disclosed to the officials of the company at the date of his application and when he filed his claim that coal oil was kept on the premises. Were I dealing with this case in the court of first instance I would have some difficulty in finding that the evidence was sufficiently conclusive as to the quantity of oil in the store at the time of the fire. The clerk, Lacerte, says that during the evening of the day preceding the fire he brought one \"quart\" of oil into the store, and that he sold a quantity which he estimates at possibly about twelve gallons and I accept this evidence in preference to that given by the witness Demers. There is no evidence as to the quantity of oil contained in a \"quart\" and Laforest speaks of a \"tonne\" containing 45 gallons. It does not appear that the one measure is deemed to be the equivalent of the other. Technically there is of course a wide difference between the two.\nHowever, I am not satisfied that I have sufficient doubt to rebut the presumption that the decision appealed against is right.\nThe appellant also urges that the agent of the company, who solicited the risk, visited the premises, and knew that coal oil was kept and stored there at the time he filled in the application. Although I am of opinion that his knowledge was the knowledge of the company because acquired in the course of his employment (Bawden v. London, Edinburgh and Glasgow Assurance Co.[1]; Wells v. Smith[2]), I cannot hold that knowledge to be equivalent to a waiver of the condition which requires that, once the policy attaches, coal oil cannot be kept or stored on the premises without the written consent of the company.\nThe appellant relies also on the second statutory condition which creates a presumption that the policy issued conforms to the terms of the application. This point is so fully and satisfactorily covered by my brother Anglin in his notes that it is unnecessary for me to do more than refer to Provident Savings Life Assurance Society v. Mowat[3].\nAt the argument I was strongly inclined to hold that the appeal must succeed because the parties had subsequently to the fire entered into an agreement which in the language of the Quebec Code is called a \"transaction\" (1918 C.C.) with respect to this claim and that\" in the result the plaintiff was entitled to recover $2,800. I accept the version given by the plaintiff and his wife of the interview during which the compromise was discussed. But to transact it was necessary for the officials of the company to have\ncomplete control over the subject matter in dispute (1919 C.C.) and I cannot find in the record sufficient evidence to justify me in holding that Demers and Tanguay had such control. The principle of the Quebec law is;\u2014\nPeuvent seuls transiger les-mandataires et administrateurs du patrimoine d'autrui qui ont re\u00e7u un pouvoir sp\u00e9cial \u00e0 cet effet. King v. Pinsonault[4].\nThis appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellant stored and kept upon his premises within the meaning of one of the statutory conditions of the policy of insurance in question herein, as an identically worded policy was construed, by a minority in this court and by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the case of Thompson v. Equity Fire Ins. Co.[5], and thereby forfeited his right to recover herein.\nThe application of appellant for the insurance in question herein contained the following obligation on his part:\u2014\nDe plus le requ\u00e9rant s'engage \u00e0.ne garder ni chaux, ni cendre dans les vaisseaux de bois, dans ou aupr\u00e8s des b\u00e2timents ci-dessus, \u00e0 ne faire aucun usage de po\u00e8le \u00e0 p\u00e9trole ou \u00e0 gazoline, ni \u00e0 prendre aucune autre police d'assurance sur les m\u00eames propri\u00e9t\u00e9s dans d'autres compagnies, sans en avertir celle-ci, sous peine de nullit\u00e9 de la police qu'il demande.\nHis counsel now presents the novel argument that inasmuch as in the same set of statutory conditions required by law to be indorsed on every policy of insurance there is the following clause,\nAfter application for insurance, it shall be presumed that any policy sent to the assured is intended to be in accordance with the terms of the application, unless the company points out in writing, the particulars wherein the policy differs from the application, the respondent was bound to point out in writing the first mentioned condition, as a particular wherein the policy differed from the application.\nI am unable to assent to this proposition.\nThere is in fact no conflict between the terms of the application and the policy if we have regard to the law (now well known to insured) binding the insurer to print upon its policy the statutory conditions.\nIt may be that the obligation above quoted from the application would be a new or additional condition which unless also printed in a different coloured ink, as required by the statute, might by such omission become null.\nThat is the converse of this case and, the insured is protected by the statute in that regard.\nThe obvious purpose of the condition, which is now presented for our consideration, was to meet the not infrequent cases of a variation in or departure from the description of the subject matter insured, as given in the application, or the time to run, or rate (if any) specified therein.\nSuch like errors sometimes might creep in and the insured was thus protected.\nIt is suggested that the condition, by virtue of which I hold the appellant fails, is one which an insurer might waive. It is very suggestive that the contention does not seem to have been set up in the appellant's pleadings. The omission might be overcome if the law and facts sustained the contention, but, if serious, why was it omitted from the pleading?\nThe appellant also sets up that the respondent settled and agreed to pay the sum claimed. That is met by evidence disputing that of appellant and that in any event the agent had no power to bind respondent in that regard.\nHolding these views there is no need to consider other issues raised.\nI think the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014The appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014The appellant urges three grounds of appeal against the judgment of the Court of King's Bench which held that he cannot recover upon his insurance policy with the defendant company, because, in breach of statutory condition 10 (f), which was indorsed upon the policy as required by article 7034 R.S.Q., when his premises were burned he had upon them for the purpose of sale thirty gallons of coal oil without having, obtained the permission in writing of the company. Thompson v. Equity Fire Ins. Co.[6].\n(1) The appellant maintains that the company through its agents adjusted his loss at $2,800 and agreed to pay him that sum in satisfaction of his claim. This fact is denied: it has not been found in favour of the appellant; and the evidence does not warrant such a finding being made.\n(2) He contends that, because the application signed by the insured contains conditions, to which he thereby agrees that his policy shall be subject, but neither sets out the statutory conditions nor refers to them, it must, under the second statutory condition, in the absence of written notice from the company to the insured particularly calling the conditions indorsed upon the policy to his attention, be deemed free from all such conditions not covered by those expressed in the application, i.e., it must be deemed such a contract as would be constituted by a bare acceptance of the application of the insured.\nBy article 7034 R.S.Q. every company is required to print the statutory conditions upon every policy of fire insurance which it issues and is allowed to vary such conditions only by complying with articles 7035 and 7036. If the conditions are not so printed the policy is nevertheless deemed subject to those of them which contain provisions in the interest of the insured. If the statute is complied with, the statutory conditions in favour of the company as well as those in favour of the insured create contractual obligations between them. Having regard to this state of the law every application for insurance should, in my opinion, be deemed an application for a policy subject to the statutory conditions, except in so far as they may be varied in conformity with article 7035\u2014that is, for a policy which the company may lawfully issue. It may well be that the effect of statutory condition No. 2 is to prevent the insurance company binding the insured by any condition inserted in the policy, other than the statutory conditions, by way of variation or otherwise, which differs from or adds to those expressed in the application. It may be that the statutory conditions themselves should be deemed modified in so far as they are inconsistent with any term expressed in the application\u2014 although, in the absence of a variation noted upon the policy itself as prescribed by article 7035, that view would seem to present some difficulties. But the legislature did not intend that the statutory conditions should be set forth in the application for insurance; and I am satisfied that, where these conditions have been duly printed upon the policy as required by the statute, it is subject to them, notwithstanding that they are neither set forth nor expressly referred to in the application. In so far as anything in the opinion of Osier J.A. in Mitchell v. City of London Assurance Co.[7], at pages 278-9, may conflict with this conclusion I am, with great respect, unable to agree with it.\n(3) Because, as counsel for the appellant asserted, it is common knowledge that the sale of coal oil is a part of the business of every country general-store, and the agent for the defendant company, when soliciting the plaintiff's insurance, saw coal oil on his premises, he contended that the company should not be heard to set up the condition relied upon; and he cited Mitchell v. City of London Assurance Co.7, in support of his argument. But the keeping of coal oil upon the insured premises is not a necessary part of the business in the case of a country general-store as is the carrying of a small quantity of lubricating oil upon a steam tug. Coal oil might have been kept outside and brought into the shop, if at all, in the permitted quantity, i.e., not exceeding five gallons. Notice to a mere soliciting agent\u2014unlike notice to a general agent\u2014is not notice, to the insurance company; and, if it were, notice that coal oil was kept on the premises before they were insured does not involve knowledge that it will be kept there afterwards in violation of an expressed condition of the policy.\nThe appeal, in my opinion, fails and should be dismissed with costs. Brodeue J. (dissident).\u2014Il s'agit d'une r\u00e9clamation pour assurance contre le feu. Plusieurs questions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9es par la d\u00e9fenderesse, la compagnie d'assurance, contre la r\u00e9clamation du demandeur. Ce dernier a eu gain de cause en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure; mais en cour d'appel il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l'assur\u00e9 ne pouvait pas r\u00e9clamer la valeur des pertes qu'il avait encourues parce qu'il avait dans son magasin de l'huile de charbon pour une quantit\u00e9 plus consid\u00e9rable que celle permise par les conditions de la police.\nLe demandeur appelle de ce jugement devant cette cour et pr\u00e9tend entr'autres choses que la condition de la police sur laquelle la cour d'appel s'est bas\u00e9e pour renvoyer sa demande ne fait pas partie des obligations contractuelles qui existaient entre lui et la compagnie d'assurance.\nContrairement \u00e0 la pratique qui est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement suivie, me dit-on, depuis que la l\u00e9gislature a jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de d\u00e9terminer les conditions des polices d'assurance, la compagnie intim\u00e9e a, dans le cas actuel, fait signer une demande d'assurance par le demandeur.\nIl s'agit de savoir si, lorsqu'il y a une demande d'assurance de faite, les conditions ins\u00e9r\u00e9es dans la police qui seraient incompatibles avec cette demande peuvent \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9es par l'assureur.\nL'article 7034 des Statuts Refondus de la Province de Qu\u00e9bec d\u00e9clare que les conditions indiqu\u00e9es dans cet article font partie de tout contrat d'assurance \u00e0 l'encontre de l'assureur. Parmi ces conditions est le No. 2 qui se lit comme suit:\nApr\u00e8s la demande d'assurance, il doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que toute police envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 l'assur\u00e9e est cens\u00e9e conforme aux termes de la demande, \u00e0 moins que la compagnie n'indique par \u00e9crit les d\u00e9tails sur lesquels la police diff\u00e8re de la demande. Il me semble que cet article est suffisamment explicite par lui-m\u00eame pour qu'il ne pr\u00eate pas \u00e0 ambiguit\u00e9. Il ne consacre, apr\u00e8s tout, que la doctrine qui se trouve dans tout contrat, c'est que du moment qu'il y a une proposition de faite et que cette proposition est accept\u00e9e, le contrat est cens\u00e9 fait suivant les termes de la proposition. Pour le contrat d'assurance, on stipule donc que s'il y a une demande d'assurance et qu'une police soit \u00e9mise en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette demande, cette police est reput\u00e9e conforme aux termes de la demande, \u00e0 moins que la compagnie n'indique formellement qu'elle est incapable d'accepter la proposition qui Lui est faite.\nPourquoi cette l\u00e9gislation a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e?\nC'est que les compagnies d'assurance avaient l'habitude d'ins\u00e9rer en tout petits caract\u00e8res dans leurs polices multitude de conditions et de clauses qui avaient virtuellement pour effet de faire dispara\u00eetre toute source d'obligations de leur part. Les tribunaux ont \u00e0 maintes reprises donn\u00e9 une interpr\u00e9tation lib\u00e9rale \u00e0 ces clauses extraordinaires. Mais, d'un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, elles donnaient lieu \u00e0 des proc\u00e8s si nombreux que le, l\u00e9gislateur a cru devoir intervenir et stipuler les conditions dans lesquelles ces polices seraient cens\u00e9es \u00eatre \u00e9mises, tout en d\u00e9clarant, cependant, que ces conditions ne valaient qu'\u00e0 l'encontre de l'assureur.\nLe l\u00e9gislateur a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 cependant en m\u00eame temps quelles \u00e9taient les conditions auxquelles l'assur\u00e9 pourrait se trouver oblig\u00e9 et il a pris le soin de r\u00e9diger lui-m\u00eame ces conditions afin d'\u00e9viter les surprises, je pourrais peut-\u00eatre m\u00eame dire les fraudes, qui \u00e9taient pratiqu\u00e9es ant\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 l'encontre de l'assur\u00e9. Il a laiss\u00e9 aux parties contractantes le soin de d\u00e9terminer si, en tant que l'assur\u00e9 est concern\u00e9, elles feraient partie du contrat ou non. L'une de ces conditions stipul\u00e9es par l'article 7034 est la condition No. 10 qui comporte que la compagnie n'est pas responsable des pertes suivantes, savoir\n(f) De la perte ou du dommage advenant lorsque du p\u00e9trole ou de l'huile de charbon, de la camphine, de la gazoline, un fluide inflammable, de la benzine, du naphte ou tous produits liquides en provenant, ou toutes parties constituantes d'iceux (sauf de l'huile de charbon clarifi\u00e9e pour fin d'\u00e9clairage seulement, d'une quantit\u00e9 n'exc\u00e9dant pas cinq gallons, * * *)\nCette condition que je viens d'indiquer textuellement peut-elle \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9e dans le cas actuel par la compagnie d'assurance?\nJe dis que non; et voici pourquoi:\nUne demande d'assurance est faite par Laforest, le demandeur. Cette demande d'assurance d\u00e9terminait le montant de l'assurance qu'il d\u00e9sirait avoir, le taux, la prime, le fonds de magasin \u00e0 assurer et la b\u00e2tisse dans laquelle se trouvaient ces marchandises. Il faisait une description, en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 certaines questions qui lui \u00e9taient pos\u00e9es, de la valeur du terrain, des b\u00e2timents, des hypoth\u00e8ques qui les grevaient et il d\u00e9clarait s'il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 pass\u00e9 au feu, quels etaient les moyens de protection qu'il avait contre le feu, \u00e0 qui les pertes devraient \u00eatre payables, et il ajoutait ceci:\nLe dit requ\u00e9rant assure et convient, par les pr\u00e9sentes, envers la dite compagnie, que ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de est la vraie, juste et enti\u00e8re exposition de tous les faits et circonstances, concernant la condition, situation, valeur et risque de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qui doit \u00eatre assur\u00e9e, en tant qu'il le conna\u00eet lui-m\u00eame et consent \u00e0 ce que telle description avec le plan d'autre part, soit consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme formant la base de responsabilit\u00e9 de cette compagnie, ainsi qu'une partie essentielle de ce contrat d'assurance. Et il est de plus convenu que si l'agent signe ou remplit cette formule de demande, il sera, en ce cas, l'agent du requ\u00e9rant et non de cette compagnie. De plus le requ\u00e9rant s'engage \u00e0 ne garder ni chaux, ni cendre, dans les vaisseaux de bois, dans un ou aupr\u00e8s des b\u00e2timents ci-dessus, \u00e0 ne faire aucun usage de po\u00e8le \u00e0 p\u00e9trole ou \u00e0 gazoline, ni \u00e0 prendre aucune autre police d'assurance sur les m\u00eames propri\u00e9t\u00e9s dans d'autres compagnies, sans en avertir celle-ci, sous peine de nullit\u00e9 de la police qu'il demande. Chaque fois qu'une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 assur\u00e9e \u00e0 cette compagnie aura \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9truite ou endommag\u00e9e par le feu, ou la foudre, la balance du billet de d\u00e9p\u00f4t non cotis\u00e9e sera d\u00e9duite de la r\u00e9clamation \u00e0 payer. Il est de plus par les pr\u00e9sentes compris et convenu que dans le cas de dommage \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 assur\u00e9e ou de destruction d'icelle, cette compagnie ne sera dans aucun cas responsable pour plus des deux tiers de la valeur de cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 au moment de la perte, dans le cas o\u00f9 il y aurait d'autres assurances dans une proportion pro rata des deux tiers de la valeur de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 assur\u00e9e. Toutes d\u00e9clarations ou r\u00e9ponses autres que celles mentionn\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sente application ne pourront \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9es contre la compagnie.\nVoil\u00e0 les conditions auxquelles il propose \u00e0 la compagnie d\u00e9fenderesse de l'assurer. La compagnie d\u00e9fenderesse, en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette demande, envoie une police et sur le dos de cette police nous trouvons toutes les conditions de l'article 7034. Nous trouvons entr'autres la condition No. 2 que j'ai cit\u00e9e plus haut et la condition No. 10.\nLa condition No. 2 lie n\u00e9cessairement la compagnie, car l'article nous dit que les conditions indiqu\u00e9es dans cet article doivent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es \u00e0 l'encontre de l'assureur comme garantie de tout contrat d'assurance. Cette condition d\u00e9clare formellement que le contrat d'assurance doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9, dans ces circonstances, comme \u00e9tant absolument conforme aux termes de la demande, \u00e0 moins que la compagnie n'ait indiqu\u00e9 par \u00e9crit les d\u00e9tails sur lesquels la police diff\u00e8re de la demande. Or, il n'y a pas de preuve au doissier, il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 non plus et il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 plaid\u00e9 que la compagnie avait indiqu\u00e9 qu'elle ne pouvait \u00e9mettre une police aux conditions \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es dans la demande. La compagnie est donc cens\u00e9e, suivant moi, avoir voulu assurer le demandeur aux conditions qu'il indiquait dans sa demande; et toutes les autres conditions, par cons\u00e9quent, qu'elle peut avoir ins\u00e9r\u00e9es sur le dos de la police ne sauraient lier l'assur\u00e9.\nL'intim\u00e9 invoque en sa faveur le jugement rendu par cette cour dans la cause de Provident Savings Life Assurance Society v. Mowat[8], o\u00f9 il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que\nA contract of life insurance is complete on delivery of the policy to the insured and payment of the first premium. Where the insured, being able to read, has had ample opportunity to examine the policy, and not being misled by the company as to its terms nor induced not to read it, has neglected to do so, he cannot after paying the premium, be heard to say that it did not contain the terms of the contract agreed upon.\nJe ne crois pas que cette d\u00e9cision, qui, a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue en 1902, puisse \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9e sous la l\u00e9gislation post\u00e9rieure qui a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 les conditions dans lesquelles les contrats d'assurance contre le feu se formeraient.\nLa livraison de la police aurait pu d'abord lier l'assur\u00e9, comme l'a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 la Cour Supr\u00eame dans cette cause de Mowat; mais maintenant je consid\u00e8re que la l\u00e9gislation en d\u00e9cr\u00e9tant que la police sera cens\u00e9e \u00eatre conforme aux termes de la demande a mis \u00e0 n\u00e9ant le principe de droit \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans cette d\u00e9cision.\nDans ces circonstances, je suis donc d'opinion que la condition invoqu\u00e9e contre l'assur\u00e9e par la cour d'appel ne le lie pas, ne peut pas \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9e contre lui; et, par cons\u00e9quent, le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure qui a condamn\u00e9 la compagnie d'assurance \u00e0 payer la somme qu'elle s'est engag\u00e9e de payer est bien fond\u00e9.\nL'appel devrait \u00eatre maintenu avec d\u00e9pens de cette cour et de la cour d'appel.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Cr\u00e9peau & Cot\u00e9.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Perrault & Perrault.\n[1] [1892] 2 Q.B. 534.\n[2] [1914] 3 K.B. 722.\n[3] 32 Can.

V., c. 51\u2014Procedure\u2014Service out of jurisdiction\u2014Costs.\nNo appeal lies to the Supreme Court of Canada from a judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick affirming the decision of a judge who refused to set aside his order for service of a writ out of the jurisdiction. Idington J. dissenting.\nPer. Davies and Anglin JJ.\u2014The judgment did not dispose of any substantive right * * * in controversy in the action and therefore was not a final judgment as that term is defined in 3 & 4 Geo. V., ch. 51.\nThe appeal was quashed but respondent was only given the general costs of appeal to the date of the motion to quash as he had not conformed to the requirements of Supreme Court Rules 4 and 5.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick affirming the refusal of a judge to set aside his order for service of the writ out of the jurisdiction.\nThe respondent moved to quash on the ground that the appeal was not from a final judgment. He claimed; also, that if the appeal would lie it only related to a matter of procedure and should not be entertained.\nM. L. Hayward on behalf of the respondent moved to quash referring to Martin v. Moore[1]; Reg. v. Toland[2]; Pritchard v. Norton[3] J. T. F. Winslow for the appellants contra cited Bray v. Ford[4]\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick which affirmed an order of a Judge in Chambers who refused to set aside an earlier order made by himself granting leave to serve a writ of summons out of the jurisdiction.\nIt seems a point of practice and there is no final judgment. The case of Martin v. Moore[5], seems in point. In the later case of Rowland & Co. v. Dominion Bank[6], the question of jurisdiction of the Supreme Court does not appear to have been considered.\nIt seems to me the only question here is whether the amendment of the \"Supreme Court Act\" 1913 defining a final judgment would cover a case such as this. The amount involved is only $48.\nWith some hesitation I have come to the conclusion that no appeal lies.\nDavies J.\u2014I concur in the opinion of Mr. Justice Anglin.\nIdington J. (dissenting)\u2014The respondent's motion to quash this appeal should turn upon a consideration first, of the question whether or not the case is covered by the general refusal of this court in mere matters of procedure to entertain an appeal dependent on procedure as was held under the construction heretofore put upon the \"Supreme Court Act\" defining the words \"final judgment,\" and secondly, the substitutionary amendment of that Act in 1913 by the first section of 3 & 4 Geo. V., ch. 51, quoted hereinafter.\nThe appeal involves the question of the jurisdiction of a New Brunswick court to try a case brought there against appellant, a foreign corporation. The appellant contends there is none because by the law of New Brunswick there is no power given in the circumstances to serve the appellant as such. We are not concerned in this motion either with the merits of the case, which is for a trifling amount, or with the law relative to the question of jurisdiction.\nIt so happens that the case may yet be tried on its merits as the judgment appealed from stands. But in principle the converse case might arise any day, of a suitor prosecuting his rights being denied justice by an order refusing to exercise the jurisdiction of the court and he suffering in such a case would, if the holding of the majority herein is maintained, be driven to a foreign court to prosecute his remedy.\nIt is alleged that is a mere question of procedure.\nEven so this court has affirmed in many cases its jurisdiction to hear appeals involving only questions of procedure.\nOf these cases, there is the case of Lambe v. Armstrong[7], in which the late Mr. Justice Girouard, speaking for the court, succinctly stated the law as follows:\u2014\nThis appeal raises only a question of procedure in the court below, and consequently the respondent contended that we should not interfere with the judgment appealed from. But questions of practice cannot be ignored by this court when their decision involves the substantial rights of the litigants, or sanctions a grave injustice. We believe that this is one of those cases. That case involved a question of procedure in regard to a sheriff's sale and this court reversed a mere practice order of the Quebec Court of Queen's Bench.\nThis court in the case of Eastern Townships Bank v. Swan[8], followed that decision in a case involving a mere question of practice as to the making of an ex parte order fixing peremptorily a date for the adduction of evidence, and hearing, and again reversed the same Court of Queen's Bench.\nIn the case of Price v. Fraser[9], this court again entertained an appeal where a mere question of procedure was involved and again reversed the same Court of Queen's Bench which had held that the Court of Review had no jurisdiction to make the order it did respecting the mere inscription of a case.\nThat case raised in principle exactly that which is raised herein. The facts upon which the question of jurisdiction turned, of course, were not the same as here, but simply raised the question of the jurisdiction of the court. And the neat point as here was, whether or not the Court of Queen's Bench, in holding the court below had no jurisdiction, was right or wrong.\nIn Finnie v. City of Montreal[10], this court affirmed its jurisdiction to review and reverse the court below on a mere question of practice. I pointed out in the argument of this motion that the law is as laid down in these cases without referring to authority, for the point has been taken so many times and decided that it was no more a question of this court's jurisdiction that was involved in the cases of mere procedure but one of expediency generally decided by regard to whether or not there was involved a question of the denial of a right sometimes tested by an appeal to the principles of natural justice.\nI know of nothing more grave in the administration of justice than a decision of whether or not a court presuming to try a case had jurisdiction to do so.\nThe appellate court haying such power of determination relative to the jurisdiction of an inferior court, which refuses to assert that power, I most respectfully submit, fails to discharge its duty.\nIn those cases involving the jurisdiction over foreigners and presuming to assert that which it has not, the question becomes more grave and delicate than when only our own citizens are concerned.\nIn the case of Arpin v. Merchants Bank of Canada[11], the late Chief Justice Strong laid down the law in refusing a new practice appeal, as follows:\u2014\nWe have always said that on points of practice like this we will follow the course of the Privy Council, as laid down in the Mayor of Montreal v. Brown and Springle[12], and we have already acted on that principle in the cases of Gladwin v. Cummings[13], Dawson v. Union Bank[14] and Scammell v. James[15].\nThese cases illustrate his meaning and the dictum relied upon in Brown's Case is to be found at page 184 of the report wherein it appears.\nI think therefore that the motion should be refused and the case heard.\nThen let us pass that ground and coming, to that involved in the amendment by section 1 of ch. 51 of 3 & 4 Geo. V. which is as follows:\u2014 Paragraph (e) of section 2 of the \"Supreme Court Act,\" chapter 139 of the Revised Statutes, 1906, is repealed and the following is substituted therefor:\u2014\n(e) save as regards appeals from the Province of Quebec, \"final judgment\" means any judgment, rule, order or decision which determines in whole or in part any substantive right of any of the parties in controversy in any action, suit, cause, matter or other judicial proceeding, and, as regards appeals from the Province of Quebec, \"final judgment\" means, as heretofore, any judgment, rule, order or decision whereby the action, suit, cause, matter or other judicial proceeding is finally determined and concluded.\nA long line of decisions by our predecessors in this court refusing to hear appeals from judgments and orders, sometimes of an interlocutory character, and at other times determining some of the rights of litigants, seemed to bind us, now sitting in this court, and several decisions were given which seemed within meaning of the \"Supreme Court Act,\" so interpreted, to prevent appeals from what in effect were final judgments though not supposed to be such as intended to come here for review.\nThis amendment I have just quoted was designed to furnish a remedy therefor.\nIt was stated by counsel supporting this motion that the Honourable the Minister of Justice had in effect stated in Parliament that the amendment emanated from this court.\nI may be permitted to disclaim any responsibility for it. I declined to take part therein for I conceived another method was desirable and the amendment as framed not unlikely to be productive of undesirable results.\nI am free, therefore, to interpret and construe it as I should any other new statute enacted to remedy what was considered an obvious evil.\nSurely if ever there was a case falling within the scope of legislation such as this, when we have regard to the numerous decisions which gave rise to a need for reform, this case presents it, if the jurisprudence of the court had not already settled the question as against the view entertained by my brother judges in proposing to quash this appeal.\nIf the jurisdiction to try the case brought against a man who disputes that jurisdiction, does not involve the determination of a substantive right of any of the parties to the controversy, I fail to understand what would.\nAs I have already shewn this court has held in the cases I have cited there was perhaps no need for the amendment to give the right of appeal.\nOr are we to be told that there was need for an amendment to take the right of appeal away in cases turning upon what may be called procedure though involving substantial questions of justice as in those I have already cited? And I have by no means exhausted the list of cases wherein the like relief has been got here. If the interpretation counsel supporting the motion tried to put upon the words is correct, such would be the effect of the amendment; it would give relief in a few cases and deprive others of the right of relief they have heretofore had.\nI am not concerned on which ground the appellant goes. Whether on the jurisprudence of this court or the amendment, clearly the appellant is entitled to have its appeal heard.\nI therefore think the motion should be dismissed.\nAnglin J.\u2014This is a purely common law action. The subject of appeal must, therefore, be a \"final judgment.\" That an order dismissing a motion to set aside the service of a writ of summons out of the jurisdiction is a final judgment apart from the statutory definition of that term is scarcely arguable. (See cases collected in Snow's Annual Practice, 1916, pp. 1108-9 and 1121-3.) That such an order was not a final judgment within the definition of that term in the \"Supreme Court Act\" prior to 1913 is settled jurisprudence. Martin v. Moore[16]. The appellant maintains that the case falls within the amendment of 1913.\nIn my opinion the right to serve a writ of summons out of the jurisdiction is not\na substantive right of any of the parties in controversy in any action,\nwithin the meaning of section 2 (e) of the \"Supreme Court Act,\" as enacted by 3 & 4 Geo. V., ch. 51, sec. 1. It is not \"a substantive right\" at all; and it is not \"a right in controversy in the action\" within the meaning of that phrase as used in section 2 (e).\nThe question disposed of by the judgment before us is one of remedy rather than of substantive right. The obligation of the contract, which is the substantive right in controversy in the action, Reg. v. Toland[17], is not affected by the giving or withholding of this additional remedy for its enforcement. Cooley's Constitutional Limitations, 5 ed., pp. 346-9. I say additional, because the existence of a remedy in the forum of the domicile of the defendant is unquestioned. No doubt the plaintiff may gain a substantial advantage and the defendant suffer a corresponding detriment as a result of the judgment in appeal\u2014but no more so than may result in many cases where some right of discovery or other purely incidental right of procedure has been accorded the one or denied the other. Nobody would dream of maintaining that a judgment or order dealing with such a matter of procedure had determined a substantive right in controversy in the action. To do so would involve holding that every interlocutory order of the highest provincial court which materially affects the remedy or prospect of recovery is appealable to this court as a final judgment. No line of exclusion could be drawn. It can scarcely be necessary to state that Parliament did not intend to do anything so irrational as to limit the right of appeal to a \"final judgment\" and then, by a definition of that term, to render the limitation thus imposed useless and absurd. While\na court of law has nothing to do with the reasonableness or unreasonableness of a provision, except in so far as it may help them in interpreting what the legislature has said, (Cooke v. Chas. A. Vogeler Co.[18]), you are not to construe the Act of Parliament so as to reduce it to rank absurdity, * * * You must give it such meaning as will carry out its objects. The \"Duke of Buccleuch\"[19].\nThe language should not unnecessarily be applied to something not within the mischief contemplated by the Act if to do so will produce manifest absurdity or inconvenience. Yates v. The Queen[20]. In my humble-opinion the language used in the definition of \"final judgment\" given its literal meaning does not lead to any such absurdity. On the contrary, it seems apt to preclude precisely the contention which the appellants present in this case. The right determined must be substantive. The judgment must affect the existence or the enforceability of the obligation sued upon\u2014the right in controversy in the action. That, I take it, means that a judgment appealable to this court as a \"final judgment\" must at least in part dispose of the merits of the action. The amendment of 1913 leaves untouched the considerations which led this court to decline jurisdiction in Martin v. Moore[21]. In fact it seems designed to make it clear that they are still to prevail\nThis amendment was enacted to meet the difficulties exemplified and emphasized by the then recent decisions in Union Bank of Halifax v. Dickie[22]; Wenger v. Lamont[23]; Clarke v. Goodall[24]; Crown Life Ins. Co. v. Skinner[25]; and Hesseltine v. Nelles[26]. In construing it, it is our duty\nto look to the purpose of the enactment, the mischief to be prevented, and the remedy which the legislature intended to apply.\nThe Queen v. Allen[27]; to suppress the mischief and advance the remedy; Heydon's Case[28], Peek v. North Staffordshire Railway Co.[29];\nto find out what the meaning of the legislature is; and to attach a rational and beneficial meaning, if possible, rather than an irrational and injurious meaning.\nMersey Steel and Iron Co. v. Naylor, Benzon & Co.[30], in 1882. The mischief which the amendment of 1913 was designed to remedy was the fact that theretofore, because no judgment was considered final for purposes of appeal to this court unless it not only disposed of the rights of the parties in controversy in the action but also concluded the action itself, in a common law action, subject to a few special exceptions, a judgment which conclusively determined that the plaintiff was entitled to the relief he sought was not appealable unless it also finally dealt with and disposed of the quantum of the recovery to which he was entitled. That was the result of the definition of \"final judgment\" as enacted by 42 Vict., ch. 39, Sec. 9\u2014a provision not unreasonable when it was made, but which afterwards became productive of consequences not anticipated owing to the introduction into common law actions of methods of procedure formerly peculiar to courts of equity. Hesseltine v. Nelles[31]. It was certainly not intended by the amendment of 1913 to make appealable to this court any judgment purely interlocutory in character. The purpose of confining the right of appeal to judgments determining substantive rights of the parties in controversy in the action was to exclude judgments or orders dealing with matters of remedy and procedure, only. The order maintaining the service of the writ is such an order. It does not determine any substantive right in controversy in the action. I am for these reasons of the opinion that the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick from which the defendant seeks to appeal is not a final judgment appealable to this court and that this appeal should be quashed.\nBrodeur J.\u2014I am in favour of granting the motion to quash because it is not a final judgment.\nThe appellant relied on the 1913 amendment but I am of opinion that the order from which he is appealing does not dispose of a \"substantive right\" of any of the parties in controversy in the action.\nOn a subsequent day His Lordship the Chief Justice delivered the following opinion as to the costs of the appeal. The Chief Justice.\u2014This appeal has been quashed for want of jurisdiction. The respondent asks not only for the costs of the motion but also for the general costs of the appeal on the ground that he moved as soon as he could and that by consent of counsel the motion, which was returnable on the first day of the May session, stood over until the appeal came on to be heard on the merits.\nRule 4 of the Supreme Court Rules provides for the respondent moving to quash within fifteen days after the security has been approved. Rule 5 provides that all proceedings in the appeal shall be stayed after service of the motion to quash until that motion has been disposed of or unless a judge of the Supreme Court shall otherwise order.\nThese two rules were adopted when the rules were revised in 1907. Previous to that time it frequently happened that appeals were quashed for want of jurisdiction when they came on to be heard on the merits and when the appellant had expended a very large sum of money in connection with the printing of his appeal book. The rules were devised to save unnecessary expense of this kind.\nIn the present instance it would appear that the solicitors took it upon themselves to ignore the provisions of Rule 5 and proceeded with the printing of the case and factums before the time had expired within which the appellant could move to affirm jurisdiction and the appeal was inscribed for hearing at the present session. This was entirely irregular and if permitted, would nullify the entire object for which the said rules were passed.\nUnder these circumstances the respondent is certainly not entitled to obtain anything more than the ordinary costs of the motion to quash and what if the rules had been observed would have been the general costs of the appeal up to the date when the motion to quash was served.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Gregory & Winslow.\nSolicitor for the respondent: M.

Mallory (Plaintiff) Appellant\nand\nThe Winnipeg Joint Terminals (Defendants) Respondent.;\n1916: May, 9, 10; 1916 May 25.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies, Idington, Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR MANITOBA\nRailways\u2014System of construction\u2014Exposed switch-rods\u2014Negligence \u2014Dangerous contrivance\u2014Verdict\u2014Findings against evidence.\nIn accordance with what was shewn to be good railway practice the tracks in the company's yards were provided with switch-rods which were left uncovered and elevated a slight distance above the ties. While in performance of his work, during the day-time, an employee sustained injuries which, it was alleged, happened in consequence of tripping on switch-rods while a car was being moved over the switch. In an action by him for damages, the jury based their verdict in his favour on a finding that the railway company had been negligent in permitting the switch-rods to remain in an exposed condition.\nHeld, per curiam, affirming the judgment appealed from (8 West. W.R. 853), that the finding of negligence by the jury in regard to the switch-rods in question was against the evidence as to proper method of construction and could not be upheld. Idington and Brodeur JJ. dissented on the view that evidence respecting the unsafe condition of the switch-rods had been properly submitted to the jury and their findings thereon ought not to be questioned.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1] reversing the judgment entered at the trial by Prendergast J. on the findings of the jury, and dismissing the plaintiff's action with costs.\nThe circumstances of the case are stated in the head-note. Wallace Nesbitt K.C. and McMurray fox the appellant.\nO. H. Clark K.C. for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal and confirm the judgment below for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Perdue.\nThe general principle applicable in negligence cases is expressed by Lord Halsbury in Wakelin v. London and South Western Railway Co.[2] in substance as follows:\u2014It is incumbent upon the plaintiff to establish by proof that the death or injury was caused by some negligent act or omission to which the death or injury complained of is attributable. That is the fact to be proved. If circumstances are equally consistent with the negligence of the plaintiff or the defendant then the action fails.\nAt the time of the accident in question the plaintiff was employed by the defendant company as one of a switch-crew of five, and was actually engaged in the terminal yards handling, at the point of intersection of three different lines, a train of four cars one of which, known in these proceedings as car No. 39112, was to be switched by what is known as a \"flying switch\" from the track on which it stood to a track known as the \"B. lead.\" To do this it was necessary to throw the switch for the latter track and open the knuckle of the coupler on the car. Both of these operations should, to avoid accident, be carried on in that order. The plaintiff was acting in direct co-operation with the switch-foreman, Lait, apparently was directing the movements of the engine attached to the cars and it was his duty to give the signal to the engineer, when he saw by the switch signal that the line was ready, to shunt the car from the track on which it stood to the \"B. lead.\" There is a good deal of evidence as to what occurred between the plaintiff and Lait to which, in my view, no importance attaches because the jury find that the accident was attributable directly to the defective condition of the switch-rod, and that no negligence is attributable to Lait. If plaintiff had done his work in the regular and proper order he should have first adjusted the coupler and then thrown the switch, in which case Lait would not have given the signal to the engine and in all human probability the accident would not have happened.\nNow, as to the negligence found, it is admitted that the car was properly equipped in accordance with the requirements of the statute. The coupler was operated by a lever from the side of the car. The complaint is that the lever was out of order and that the plaintiff was obliged, to adjust the coupler, to go behind the car and shake the coupler loose with his hand. I can see no reason why he should have assumed that risk and, to have attempted to work at the coupler with his back turned towards the moving car, as he did, was in the circumstances highly imprudent. Plumb v. Cobden Flour Mills Co.[3]. However, it will not be necessary to say more as to this because I am satisfied that the accident cannot be fairly attributed, on the evidence, to the cause assigned by the jury\u2014a defective switch-rod. In the first place, admitting what, in my opinion, is not proved, that the plaintiff slipped on the switch-rods, there is no evidence to support the finding that they were not properly constructed or that they should have been covered. It is admitted by all the witnesses including the plaintiff, that switch-rods worked from a switch-stand on the level like those in question are always left uncovered. When they are worked from an interlocking tower it is different because of the delicate mechanism of the locking part. It is also said, although not so found by the jury, that the line was badly ballasted and that a vacant space existed between the switch-rod and the ground which was a cause of danger, but I think the weight of evidence is to the effect that the switch-rods were placed and maintained in accordance with good railway construction and the general practice of railways in this country. Further, the \"Railway Act\" makes ample provision for the equipment of trains and the construction of road bed, tracks and switches for the general protection of all those who travel or are connected with the operation and maintenance of railways, and it has not been suggested here that the respondent company in any way failed to observe the requirements of the statute. Section 280 of the \"Railway Act,\" which deals with switches, contains no provision relating to the covering of switch-rods and no order or regulation has been made by the Board under the general powers conferred by section 30 of the Act, nor has the inspecting engineer made any order under section 263. The rule applicable to cases like this is well expressed by Pollock in his work on Torts (10 ed.) p. 476, referring to the case of Crafter v. The Metropolitan Railway Co.[4]:\u2014\nA staircase * * * cannot be pronounced dangerous and defective merely because the plaintiff has slipped on it, and somebody can be found to suggest improvements. This is an analogous case. Here the switch-rod is proved to have been constructed in the usual way, according to the system generally adopted in this country. If it is left to the jury to decide what improvements ought to be made in the interests of good railway construction then we will have custom or local usage set up as a test of negligence. The standard of care is a legal one and the question for the jury is whether the master or the servant, as the case may be, has lived up to it. If it is for the jury to decide as to proper railway construction in view of the provisions of our \"Railway Act,\" then we will have juries in Manitoba, deciding differently from juries in Ontario on the same state of facts with respect to the same railway. I agree absolutely with Mr. Justice Perdue:\nThe question as to whether all switch-rods should be covered for the protection of the railway employees is one of very great importance. The form of the protection to be adopted, if protection is to be made obligatory, would necessitate the assistance and advice of experts and the most careful consideration by the legislature or body possessing the power to compel the adoption of the device. Should it be left to a jury to say that defendants were negligent because they adopted the course followed by every railway company in Canada, and left the switch-rods uncovered? It appears to me that the matter is essentially one to be dealt with by Parliament or the Railway Board, so that the device to be adopted will be put in general use by all railways, and it will not be left to the conjecture of a jury to pronounce upon the necessity for, or the sufficiency of, the protection in each case.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDavies J.\u2014This was an action brought by the appellant, a switchman in defendants' employ, to recover damages for injuries sustained by him while in the performance of his duties as switchman in defendants' yard or station. The accident happened in broad daylight. A \"flying switch\" had been made and the plaintiff had cut off two cars which had moved to their proper place. Plaintiff then set the switch so that another car might be pushed to another track. The setting of the switch automatically moved the switch-signal so that the switch-foreman, Lait, who was standing by ready to signal the engineer when to back up, seeing the switch was thrown for the \"B lead\" and Mallory was standing by it, walked towards the engine and gave the signal to \"shunt the car,\" which was done.\nIt appears from his evidence that Mallory after turning the switch walked over towards the car to be switched and noticed that the knuckle of the coupler in the end of the car was not open. He crossed the track and tried with the lever to open it but for some reason it would not open. Mallory then stepped on the track between the rails and with his back to the car and with one hand on the lever and another on the coupler tried to open the knuckle. He knew that the opening of the switch by himself a few moments before was the signal for the engineer to \"shunt the car.\" He put himself in this very dangerous position with knowledge that he could not be seen by the engineer and that the train would in all human probability immediately move towards him to shunt the car. As he ought to have expected, the car did move with the result that he was knocked down and injured.\nThe jury properly found that Lait, the signalman, was not guilty of negligence in giving the signal to the engineer to shunt and they also found that Mallory was not guilty of contributory negligence in placing himself where he did with his back to the end of the car to be shunted with one hand upon the lever and one upon the coupler. I must say I think this finding is contrary to the evidence. I do not propose, however, to base my judgment upon that conclusion.\nThe jury further found that the defendants were guilty of negligence \"in not properly covering the switch-rods\" and that the \"exposed condition of the switch-rods\" constituted \"negligence on the part of the defendants\" and that the tripping of the defendant was \"due to the exposed condition of the switch-rods.\"\nI have very great doubts whether the evidence was such as justified the finding that the plaintiff tripped on the switch-rods. Plaintiff does not say so himself. He says he does not know what he tripped on, whether the switch-rods or a stone or something else. Mr. Nesbitt suggested that there was a space below the switch-rods in which plaintiff's foot may have caught and that the defendants' negligence consisted in their leaving that open space there; but that is all pure speculation. The jury have not so found. They have specially found that the defendants' negligence consisted in \"leaving the switch-rods uncovered and exposed\" and this is the only negligence found.\nThe question therefore is fairly and squarely raised whether leaving these switch-rods uncovered was negligence.\nIt was not contended that the \"Railway Act\" required them to be covered or that the Railway Board had ever made any order to that effect. It was proved beyond doubt that, except in the case of an interlocking plant which for some special reasons called for a covering of the switch-rods, it was the universal railway practice in Canada and always had been to leave the switch-rods uncovered\u2014that it was good railway practice and that the same practice prevailed universally throughout the United States. As is stated by Perdue J. the question on these facts is one to be dealt with by Parliament or the Railway Board.\nTo that body Parliament had delegated the amplest powers in such a matter as this. The Board is a body of men specially experienced n dealing with such matters and is assisted by skilled experts. In my judgment unless Parliament expressly dealt with such an important matter of universal railway practice the Board was the proper tribunal to do so and it having seen fit by its silence to sanction this practice it is not open to a jury, at any rate in the absence of some evidence that the practice of leaving the switch-rods uncovered was bad and negligent, to hold that it is\nParliament did expressly deal in part with the subject by making provision, in section 288 of the \"Railway Act,\" requiring packing of the fixed rails at switches. That Act vests in the Railway Board power to make regulations respecting the appliances, devices, structures and works to be used on a railway for the protection of the company's employees (sections 50 and 269). It was conceded that the Board, in the many orders it has made since it was established, has not made any order or regulation requiring the covering of switches. I am not qualified to give an opinion on the subject, neither, I venture to say, are juries so qualified, at any rate in the absence of proper evidence. To pronounce an opinion upon the subject condemning the universal practice in Canada would require much knowledge of the actual working of our Canadian railways under our climatic conditions and much expert knowledge.\nIn the case before us there was no evidence that the existing practice and one which has always prevailed in Canada, was other than good railway practice, except that of Mr. Haddow, whose knowledge on the point was confined\" to Great Britain. The findings of the jury that the uncovered switch-rods was in itself negligence and that such negligence caused the damage, cannot be upheld.\nFor these reasons I think the appeal should be dismissed.\nIdington J (dissenting).\u2014I think there was evidence to su mit to the jury on all the points upon which their findings have been questioned.\nAs to the question of whether or not the appellant was justified in making the effort he did to serve his masters by stepping behind a car liable to be put in motion, there is abundant uncontradicted evidence that it is usual for men engaged in the service he was, to do the like, to perform the like service, and the respondent no doubt expected it to be done or the prohibition embodied in the contract the appellant signed would, have been extended so as to include the doing so.\nAs to the fact of the appellant having tripped upon the exposed switch-rods there was evidence reasonably applied justifying that inference.\nAnd as to the negligence involved in leaving the switch-rods exposed that would seem to be rather patent so long as men engaged as appellant was were expected to do their work under such circumstances as he did and travel over said rods.\nIt is idle to talk of what is done on other roads so long as the uses to which that part of the track on other roads is put, or permitted to be put, is not (as it was not herein) shewn to have been used in the like dangerous condition, by men employed in and about their work, in the same manner and liable to the same risks as appellant had to encounter in serving respondents.\nNo matter how dangerous a track may be so long as men have not to walk upon it. When men are invited and expected to do so in order to save the employers' property, it is negligence to fail to cover as in other cases mentioned.\nThe law imposes upon the employer the duty to furnish a reasonably safe place for his men to work. The respondent did not do so in the case in question.\nWe are told these rods are covered at interlocking switches to protect the mechanical device.\nThe cost of repairing the mechanical device makes it worth while protecting the metal, but human flesh and blood come cheaper and therefore needless to bother about that.\nSuch is the logic by which the railway man reaches the prudent conclusion we are asked to accept as a conclusive answer to this charge of negligence to provide a safe place for men to work in.\nAgain we are pressed with the so-called argument that the legislature has not intervened, though it has in many other cases, to protect workmen.\nThe unfortunate truth is that the oft failure, of courts of justice to maintain the elementary principle of the common law that the safe place to work in should be provided, so far as reasonably possible, has rendered it necessary for the legislature time and again to step in and address itself to specific results of failure on the part of the courts.\nBut in doing so it has not abrogated the common law but added new sanctions thereto and in one instance cited in appellant's factum has declared no inference is to be drawn therefrom.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs. Anglin J.\u2014I am not disposed to disturb the finding negativing contributory negligence and I think that there was evidence to support the finding that the plaintiff tripped upon the switch-rods. The only negligence found against the defendants was \"the exposed condition of the switch-rods.\"\nWhile I attach little weight to the argument that the only duties incumbent upon railway companies in regard to the construction, maintenance and operation of their undertakings are those specifically prescribed by Parliament and the Board of Railway Commissioners, and that the fact that neither the \"Railway Act\" nor any order of the Board has imposed an obligation to pack or cover railway switch-rods, affords a conclusive answer to this action, with the learned Chief Justice of Manitoba, upon the evidence in this record, I am not prepared to say that \"where the ordinary switch-rods universally used in Canada and the United States are not covered, a jury may infer negligence against a railway company.\" There is no evidence from any person qualified to speak upon the subject that, having regard to climatic and other conditions in this country, it is practicable to cover ordinary switch-rods, as is suggested, or that so covered they would not be a greater menace and source of danger and inconvenience than in their present condition. Without such evidence I think it is not within the province of a jury to condemn as negligent a practice universally observed on this continent. Jackson v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.[5]; Zuvelt v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[6]; Phelan v. Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Co.[7]. The fact that interlocking switches are covered is referred to. But the necessity for protecting the delicate mechanism of these switches may make the covering of them indispensable although attended by risks and inconvenience which would render unjustifiable the covering of ordinary switches where such a necessity does not exist.\nIn the alternative the plaintiff asks a new trial, because the learned trial judge refused to submit the condition of the coupler to the jury as a ground of negligence. There was no evidence of any lack of proper inspection\u2014no evidence of any defect in the coupler which such inspection would have disclosed; and, upon the evidence, any defective condition of the coupler that may have existed could not properly have been found to be a proximate cause, of the accident.\nThe appeal, in my opinion, fails.\nBrodeur J. (dissenting).\u2014The plaintiff appellant, was in the respondents' employ and, when in the discharge of his duties, he was injured. He claims that the accident is due to the negligence of the company.\nThe jury found in his favour in declaring that the exposed condition of the switch-rods in the yard constituted an act of negligence.\nIt was suggested that some other obstruction might have been the cause of the accident and some evidence to that effect was adduced, but the jury believed the facts as told by the appellant and then we have to accept their verdict in that regard, so that the only question that remains is whether the railway companies in failing to cover their switch-rods between the tracks or in exposing those rods as is proved in this case are guilty of negligence.\nIt is in evidence that in England switch-rods are covered and in our country semaphore and signal wires of the interlocking systems in the yards are also covered.\nThe evidence does not shew the reason why the covering is made in the case of interlocking plants. But I have reason to believe that it is due to the intervention of the Railway Committee of the Privy Council at first and of the Railway Board after.\nThose interlocking plants have been brought into our railway system when the applications for crossing railway tracks were being considered. Specifications of those interlocking plants were supplied by the Government authorities and the railways had to cover those wires.\nWhy the same system was not introduced in the switching apparatus is because the matter was likely never considered by the Railway Board.\nIt seems to me, however, that in extensive yards like the one under consideration, where employees have to walk on tracks all the time in the discharge of their duties, it is only a reasonable measure of precaution that those dangerous holes in the track should be removed.\nThe evidence shews that in some cases in Canada those rods are covered. If the Railway Board had passed judgment on the advisability of covering them I might come to a different conclusion. But the fact that the Board has not passed any order would not debar the courts of justice from inquiring as to whether negligence should be charged or not.\nWhen the risk attendant on some act is larger than in some other cases, special precautions should be taken and the degree of care is proportionately larger. Grant v. Great Western Railway Co.[8]. The question of negligence with regard to those rods was properly left to the jury. No objection had been made to that procedure.\nFor these reasons the appeal should be allowed with costs of this court and of the court below and the verdict of the jury should be sustained.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: McMurray, Davidson & Wheeldon.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Clark & Jackson.\n[1] 8 West.

E. I.\u2014Winding-up in B.C. \u2014Leave of court of B.C.\u2014R.S.C. c. 1U, ss. 22 and 23.\nWhere a trust company incorporated by the Parliament of Canada with headquarters in Vancouver is being wound up in British Columbia, leave of the Supreme Court of that province is necessary before suit can be brought in Prince Edward Island against the liquidator and the company to have the latter declared a trustee of moneys deposited with it for investment, for its removal from office and appointment of a new trustee and for the vesting in such new trustee of the securities representing said moneys. Davies J. dissenting.\nJudgment appealed against (24 D.L.R. 554) reversed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal in Equity of Prince Edward Island ([1]) affirming the judgment of the Vice-Chancellor who refused to set aside the bill of complaint on the ground that the plaintiffs had not obtained leave to bring the suit from the Supreme Court of British Columbia.\nThe only question raised on this appeal was whether or not a suit of the nature stated in the above head-note could be brought in the courts of Prince Edward Island without the leave of the Supreme Court of British Columbia. In other words, whether or not section 22 of the \"Winding-up Act\" applies to such a case. The courts below held that it does not.\nLafleur K.C. and A. E. MacDonald K.C. for the appellant.\nGaudet K.C. for the respondents.\nDavies J. (dissenting)\u2014This is an appeal from the Court of Appeal in Equity in Prince Edward Island dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Vice-Chancellor Fitzgerald dismissing in turn an application made to him by the appellant, as liquidator of the Dominion Trust Company, to have a bill of complaint filed in his court against the said Trust Company and the liquidator thereof dismissed on the ground that the action was commenced without the leave of the Supreme Court of British Columbia as required by the 22nd and 23rd sections of the \"Winding-up Act.\"\nThe question for our determination is whether those 22nd and 23rd sections are applicable to proceedings such as these or whether they come within section 133 of the Act.\nTo determine that question it is necessary to see in what relation the complainants stand to the company and its estate and effects.\nTo do this, we have only before us the statements in the complainant's bill of complaint. The liquidator has not put in any answer to that bill and it seems to me that on this application we are bound to assume the truth of the statements in the bill.\nThere is no charge of any breach of trust or any claim that the complainants are creditors of the company. The bill seeks a declaration that certain moneys paid by the complainants to the Trust Company and received by it are trust moneys held by it for the use and benefit of the complainants and that certain mortgages set out in the schedule to the Act were obtained as securities by the defendant company for loans made with complainants' money, and that the company may be declared to be a trustee of such mortgages for the complainants and that as such company is now insolvent it may be removed from the office of trustee and some other person or company substituted for it.\nThe certificate or declaration of trust which complainants received from the company when they paid over their moneys to it is set out in the bill.\nAssuming therefore the truth of the statements in the bill of complaint the question arises whether section 22 of the Act applies at all.\nThis section is one taken from the Imperial \"Winding-up Act\" and has been the subject of numerous decisions in the English courts. In construing it and its application the Appeal Court has held in several cases that it did not extend to the case of a landlord distraining upon the goods of the insolvent company which were found upon the land leased and that the landlord's common law right of distraint was not interfered with by the section which \"dealt only with the company, its creditors and its contributories.\nIn the case of In re Lundy Granite Co.; ex parte Heavan ([2]), the Lords Justices, reversing a decision of Lord Romilly, M.R., held that the sections 163 and 87 of the English Act (corresponding to sections 22 and 23 of our Act), did not prevent a landlord from distraining upon the goods of the company for rent accrued since the winding-up. Sir W. M. James, at p. 467, said: It must be the true meaning of the Act to consider these provisions as confined to proceedings by a creditor of the company against the goods of the company; and the Act must be read according to the manifest intention, which could not have been that during the many years over which the winding-up may extend the court should have power to interfere with the rights of every one who happened to have goods of the company in his possession. The landlord has a right to proceed against his tenant, and against the goods of every stranger which happen to be upon the land, and subject to distress.\nIn a later case of In re Regent United Service Stores ([3]), the Appeal Court, reversing a judgment of Malms Vice-Chancellor, held that the landlord was not a creditor of the company and that his legal right as landlord could not be interfered with under these sections.\nJessel M.R. at page 618, says:\nThe first question that arises is, whether the statutory provision applies where the landlord is not a creditor of the company. On this point, I need not say more than that it was decided by. the Lord Justices in the case of In re Lundy Granite Company ([4]) that it does not apply. That decision is binding upon us, and we need go no further to find a reason for reversing the decision of the Vice-Chancellor.\nThe other justices concurred with him and Thesiger L.J., referring to In re Lundy Granite Company, ([5]) said, at page 620:\nThe ratio decidendi was not the difference between claims existing at the time of the winding-up order and claims subsequently arising, but that, where a person has no right to claim as a creditor against the company, the court has no jurisdiction to interfere with his legal right against the company's property.\nIn the case of In re Longdendale Cotton Spinning Co. ([6]), it was held that the mere fact that an order has been made for winding-up a company does not prevent a debenture holder or mortgagee of the company from bringing an action to realize his security and for that proposition the authority of the Court of Appeal in In re David Lloyd & Co. ([7]) was cited as\nemphatically negativing the existence of any such right.\nIn The Longdendale Cotton Case,([8]) Jessel M.R. says (p. 153):\nThen the third objection is that the mortgagors are themselves desirous of selling the property, and that, if the mortgagee sells the property in the action, the probability is that nothing will be left for the general creditors; whereas if the mortgagors sell it, the result may be better for all parties. The answer to that is, the mortgagors had better redeem. If the mortgagee wants to sell he has the right to sell, and to prevent him from selling would be an interference with his rights, and I see no equity in the mortgagors which should deprive him of those rights.\nThen the only other point is whether the winding-up makes any difference or confers any new rights. The mere fact that a winding-up order has been made makes no difference, and does not confer upon the company the right of preventing a mortgagee from realizing his security; and for that proposition I have the authority of the Court of Appeal in In re David Lloyd & Co.([9]), an authority which emphatically negatives the existence of any such right.\nIt has been suggested that this case is not a binding authority because it was a voluntary winding-up. But the judgment of the Master of the Rolls is not based upon that, but broadly upon the construction of the statute and the authority of In re David Lloyd & Co. ([10]) above cited which was a company being wound up under a compulsory winding-up order.\nI think we are bound by the decisions of the courts of appeal and should not grant the order dismissing the action under sections 22 and 23.\nThen section 133 is relied upon, but it seems to me that the same reasoning which confined the operation of sections 163 and 87 of the English Act to claims of creditors only, must apply to this section also. That section reads as follows:\u2014 All remedies sought or demanded for enforcing any claim for a debt, privilege, mortgage, lien or right of property upon, in or to any effects or property in the hands, possession or custody of a liquidator, may be obtained by an order of the court on summary petition, and not by any action, suit, attachment, seizure or other proceeding of any kind whatsoever.\nTo give the section 133 the broad construction claimed for it and to extend it to all persons creditors and non-creditors would have the effect not only of practically reversing several English decisions of the Court of Appeal, but would result in transferring the exclusive jurisdiction over trusts and the property trustees hold as such, which is now vested in the Court of Chancery of the Province of Prince Edward Island with regard to trust property held in that province, to the court winding-up an insolvent company in another province.\nThe result would be that the winding-up court in British Columbia could determine on \"summary petition\" the legal rights of trustees and cestuis qui trustent in Prince Edward Island whether these cestuis qui trustent were creditors of the insolvent company or not.\nNow I can well understand that such an enactment, however far reaching it might be and however much it might interfere with civil rights in the province in so far as it dealt with the creditors or contributories or assets of the company and so was reasonably necessary for the purpose Parliament was legislating upon, would be intra vires of the Dominion Parliament, but I should more than doubt the power of Parliament when legislating upon the subject matter of bankruptcy and insolvency to deal with and take away the rights of third parties not creditors or contributories of the company and not claiming any right to share in the distribution of the assets of the insolvent company. Surely the negative words of section 133 prohibiting\nan action, suit, attachment, seizure or other proceeding of any kind whatsoever\nbeing brought\nto enforce any claim for debt, privilege, mortgage, lien or right of property\nhave reference only to actions of creditors or contributories and do not extend to third parties who are not creditors and are not concerned in the distribution of the assets but seek to assert a legal or equitable right to property they claim as theirs and which the company holds in trust for them.\nOf course, I can appreciate the fact that in a case such as the one before us there ought not to be and there would not be any difficulty in obtaining leave from the judge of the British Columbia court having charge of the winding-up proceedings to bring and prosecute this action under section 22, but if the construction of section 133 is as broad and comprehensive as contended for, the only way complainants could enforce their claim as set forth in this action would be a summary petition before the court in British Columbia.\nI am strongly inclined to adopt the view of Mr. Justice Haszard that at any rate the application to dismiss the action is premature. It is possible that at the trial if a defence is put in and the crucial statements of fact made in the complainants' bill are converted and found against the complainants, or if at the, hearing they should be found to be creditors or their claim one which affected the distribution of the assets of the company, in other words, if the court found that these moneys and mortgages in controversy were really assets of the company and not trust property held for the claimants, a condition would then be found to exist which would make sections 22 and 133 applicable.\nIn my opinion and as the suit stands at present, they are not so applicable and the courts below were right in so holding.\nI would therefore dismiss the appeal.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellant is the liquidator of the Dominion Trust Company which was incorporated by an Act of the Dominion Parliament and ordered by the Supreme Court of British Columbia, acting by virtue of the powers conferred upon it by the \"Winding-up Act\" and amendments thereto, to be wound up.\nThe respondents instituted thereafter proceedings by way of a bill filed in the Court of Chancery in Prince Edward Island against the said company to have it removed as trustee of certain parties for purposes within the scope of its Act of incorporation and another substituted.\nThe appellant as liquidator moved the said court to have the said bill dismissed on the ground that leave to bring the suit had not been obtained from the Supreme Court of British Columbia as required by section 22 of the\" Winding-up Act\" which is as follows:\u2014\n22. After the winding-up order is made, no suit, action or other proceeding shall be proceeded with or commenced against the company, except with the leave of the court and subject to such terms as the court imposes: .\nThe language of this section seems so clear and comprehensive that I can see no room for doubt as to its meaning.\nThe Dominion Trust Company is a corporate creature of Parliament and. everything relative to its existence or extinction in any way its creator chooses to direct and the relation of those contracting with it pursuant to its corporate powers must be governed by what it chooses to enact.\nThe \"Winding-up Act\" seems to apply to any such corporations as the one in question. Indeed there are only a few classes of the Dominion corporations which are excluded from its operation. This is not one. I am, therefore, unable to follow the reasoning upon which the court below has proceeded.\nThe term assets therein relied upon so much is not defined by the Act and is of somewhat variable meaning according to the context in which it is used. Indeed the Act uses the word in one or two places, as for example, in referring in section 47 to \"money and assets\" and section 93 \"any property or assets,\" in a way that is illustrative of this.\nThe ascertainment of the assets distributable amongst the creditors, so far as unsecured, is part of the duty of the liquidator under the direction of the court. He cannot do that efficiently if everyone is to be at liberty to interfere and pursue his own notions of his rights of litigation.\nSection 133, for example, furnishes a summary remedy which might be made applicable to respondent's claims, if of the clear and undoubted character their counsel suggests.\nIf not of that character it is quite competent for the court, in charge of the proceedings, to permit some more suitable remedy either in that court or in such court as it may direct.\nThe scheme of the Act does not in any way imply that any one is to be deprived of his right in law or equity. To say that some of the trust funds are traceable in such a way that in law they must be appropriated to meet the demands of particular cestuis que trustent creditors, possibly in priority to others not so fortunate, means nothing in this connection.\nAll such rights as any man or class of men may have in that regard or any way, must be followed and enforced in a due and orderly manner such as the \"Winding-up Act\" contemplates and in part prescribes, and evidently intends should be pursued.\nThe Act in many of its provisions may fall short of meeting what might well have been provided and prescribed for the emergencies of such a case as the respondents present.\nThe evident scope of the Act, however, clearly is that the courts should be resorted to in order to determine the rights of any creditor or claimant, whatever they may be, according to the settled principles of law applicable thereto.\nI see no difficulty in the claims of the respondents, if what they assert be correct, being established just as much as a mortgagee may be permitted to assert his claim.\nIt is not to be presumed that the court will refuse, in a proper case properly presented, the right to establish any such claim.\nIt is therefore incumbent upon the court having the matter in charge to give every person the liberty to prosecute his rights, whatever they may be in law, to enforce same.\nAll that the Act by section 22, as I understand it, means is that reckless and undesirable litigation should be avoided and the consequent waste or ruin thereby of the estate averted.\nBut whenever there is affair claim of right in the way of lien or otherwise presented, he having it or the class he belongs to having it, should be given the right to prosecute and establish same.\nTrust funds may thus be traceable as in bankruptcy cases, and a prior claim thereto be established.\nI observe that the learned Vice-Chancellor has pointed out the re-incorporation of the company by Prince Edward Island legislation. But that is not what the bill of complaint presents and we must be limited in our view to what it does shew as respondents' ground of complaint.\nIt is to be observed, moreover, that the effect of re-incorporation by a provincial legislature of a Dominion company, in light of the decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the case of City of Toronto v. The Bell Telephone Co. ([11]), does not seem to hold out much encouragement to the founding an action or suit on the re-incorporation.\nIncidentally it may well be that such legislation, treated as of a contractual nature, may help respondents in asserting their rights.\nI think the appeal must be allowed with costs but without prejudice to the parties respondent, or any of them, asserting their right to apply for leave and prosecuting their rights under the direction of the court seized of the proceedings under the \"Winding-up Act.\"\nDuff J.\u2014I would allow the appeal.\nAnglin J.\u2014Section 133 of the \"Winding-up Act\" provides a method whereby the complainants may obtain in a summary and inexpensive way the declara- tion of trust which they seek. The English statute does not contain a similar provision. I am, therefore, with respect, of the opinion that the reason for which the prohibitive clause of the English \"Companies' Act\"- of 1862 (sec. 87), corresponding to section 22 of our statute, was held inapplicable in. some of the cases referred to in Halsbury at p. 538, cited by the learned Chief Justice of Prince Edward Island, not to actions or suits against the company, but to proceedings by way of distress\u2014most of them cases where there was no liability of the company itself, In re Lundy Granite Co. ([12]); In re Trimsaran Coal, Iron and Steel Co. ([13]); In re Regent United Service Stores ([14]), \u2014does not exist here. The complainants' interests are provided for and may be asserted by proceedings in the winding-up. No ground has been shewn, in my opinion, for excluding this suit from the operation of section 22, and a remedy in the winding-up being available, leave to maintain it would not improbably be refused, In re David Lloyd Co. ([15]), although it would otherwise be readily granted, In re Longdendale Cotton Spinning Co. ([16]).\nI incline to think, however, that section 133 is prohibitive of any action or suit, such as that brought by the complainants in so far as they seek a declaration of trust and an allocation to the trust, of certain \"effects or property in the hands, possession or custody of a liquidator,\" and prescribes an application by summary petition as the exclusive means of obtaining this part of the relief sought. Once the trust has been established the appointment of a new trustee would seem almost a matter of course. Counsel for the respondents urges the grave inconvenience to his clients in Prince Edward Island involved in their being obliged to proceed in the courts of British Columbia. But by section 125 of the Act provision is made for the transfer of any matter relating to the winding-up to any of the several provincial courts. That section contemplates the application for transfer being made in the first instance to the court charged with the liquidation, with the concurrence of the court to which removal is sought \u2014orders of both courts being obtained if thought advisable. I decline to assume that upon its being shown to the Supreme Court of British Columbia that the questions as to the existence of the trust alleged by the plaintiffs and the earmarking of certain property held by the liquidator as trust assets can be best inquired into in Prince Edward Island\u2014as from what is now before us would seem to be the case\u2014an order of transfer will not be made, preceded or accompanied by the necessary leave under section 22.\nNo doubt some inconvenience will be involved in such exceptional cases as this where the winding-up of the company is conducted in a province of the Dominion far distant from that in which persons interested as creditors or claimants may reside. But Parliament probably thought it necessary in the interest of prudent and economical winding-up that the court charged with that duty should have control not only of the assets and property found in the hands or possession of the company in liquidation, but also of all litigation in which it might be involved. The great balance of convenience is probably in favour of such single control though it may work hardship in some few cases.\nFor these reasons I would allow this appeal. Brodeur J.\u2014The appellant is the liquidator of the Dominion Trust Company and the respondents, on behalf of themselves and other cestuis qui trustent began proceedings in the Court of Chancery of Prince Edward Island and prayed that the Dominion Trust Company be removed from the office of trustee for the respondents and the other cestuis qui trustent and that a new trustee be appointed in its place. They asked also that certain mortgages in the Island taken as security for loans made by the company with moneys received from the respondent and other inhabitants of the Island be vested in the new trustee.\nThe insolvent company, through its liquidator, as asked that the complaint of the respondents be dismissed on the ground that leave to the Supreme Court of British Columbia to bring the suit was not first obtained as required by section 22 of the \"Winding-up Act.\"\nThe courts below decided against the appellant and the company on the ground that the trust funds were not affected by the \"Winding-up Act\" and that the courts of Prince Edward Island alone have jurisdiction over trusts and trustees in that province and must determine whether or not the moneys received by the Dominion Trust Company from the respondents are trust funds.\nI am unable to agree with the proposition that the proceedings could be instituted against the insolvent company without leave of the court in whose jurisdiction the liquidation takes place.\nSection 22 of the \"Winding-up Act\" is very wide and reads as follows:\nAfter the winding-up order is made, no suit, action or other proceeding shall be proceeded with or commenced against the company except with the leave of the court and subject to such terms as the court imposes. The object of this legislation is to prevent litigation being carried on by any one prejudicial to the estate, to prevent the assets being dissipated by law suits, and to have all such matters decided promptly by a summary petition (sec. 133).\nThe Dominion Trust Company was incorporated by the Federal Parliament and its chief place of business was declared by its Act of incorporation to be in the Province of British Columbia. The proceedings to wind up that company were naturally instituted in the Supreme Court of British Columbia.\nIt may be that by some provision of the Act suits against the company could be brought in some other province (sec. 125); but the courts of the various provinces are declared auxiliary to one another for the purpose of the \"Winding-up Act\" and the proceedings may be transferred from one court to another with the concurrence, or by the order, of the two courts or by an order of the Supreme Court of Canada.\nThat provision of the law, however, would not prevent the court in which the liquidation takes place from granting its leave for the continuance or the instituting of suits or proceedings against the company. The distinction which is sought to be made between actions instituted by ordinary creditors and those instituted by or against trustees could not apply because the law is general and declares formally that no suit or proceeding can be commenced or proceeded with without the leave of the court. The courts have in different cases granted leave to proceed against the company, In re David Lloyd & Co. ([17]), but so far as I have been able to see they have not decided that proceedings even by mortgagees or cestuis qui trustent could be instituted without leave.\nIn this case it looks to me as if the ends of justice would be better served by having the question raised in this proceeding disposed of by the courts of Prince Edward Island. However, it was the duty of the respondents to have the leave of the court of British Columbia which they did not secure.\nThis is a suit in which all the creditors of the company might be interested, because its purpose is to have a declaration that some funds should belong exclusively to the plaintiffs and should not be disposed of for the benefit of the creditors. Besides, the company, by the agreement with the plaintiff creditors, has an interest in those funds; because the interest and profits resulting from the investment of the principal sum over the rate of interest payable to the investor is the property of the company. For those reasons, I would allow the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Aeneas A.

VII., chap. 75, an appeal lies to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, in certain cases, from judgments of the Court of Review, where the amount or value of the thing demanded exceeds $5,000. Section 40 of the \"Supreme Court Act,\" R.S.C, 1906, chap. 139, provides for appeals from the Court of Review to the Supreme Court of Canada, in cases which are not appealable to the Court of King's Bench, but are appealable to the Privy Council.\nHeld, Anglin J. dissenting, that the words \"the thing demanded\" in the third clause of article 68 of the Code of Civil Procedure refer to the demande in the action, and not to the amount recovered by the judgment, if they are different; consequently, an appeal lies, in such cases, from the judgments of the Court of Review to the Supreme Court of Canada where the amount or value claimed in the declaration exceeds five thousand dollars. Allan v. Pratt (13 App. Cas. 780); Dufresne v. Guevremont (26 Can. S.C.R. 216); and Citizens Light and Power Co. v. Parent (27 Can. S.C.R. 316) discussed; Town of Outremont v. Joyce (43 Can. S.C. R. 611) and Dominion Salvage and Wrecking Co. v. Brown (20 Can. S.C.R. 203) referred to.\nMOTION to quash an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Review, sitting at Montreal, affirming the judgment of Martineau J., in the Superior Court, District of Montreal, by which the plaintiff's action was maintained with costs. The plaintiff, by his declaration, prayed that the defendants should be condemned to pay him the sum of $5,017.20, for damages claimed under several specified items which, however, when correctly added together, did not amount to $5,000, and, by the judgment in the Superior Court, he was awarded $2,303. The Court of Review, by the judgment appealed from, confirmed this award. In the circumstances, the respondent moved to quash the appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada on the ground that the true amount of the demande was less than $5,000; that the controversy on the appeal involved merely the amount of the condemnation ($2,303), and that, under the 40th section of the \"Supreme Court Act,\" no appeal could lie.\nLouis Cot\u00e9 supported the motion.\nA. Lemieux K.C. contra.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This is a motion to quash an appeal for want of jurisdiction. The facts, as disclosed by the material filed, appear to be that an action was brought by respondent Genge to recover from the defendant (as stated in his declaration) the sum of $5,017.20. Certain affidavits are filed shewing that the particulars attached to the claim had been incorrectly added up, and that, in fact, the only amount, even on the plaintiff's shewing, was $4,978.20.\nIn my view, the question of jurisdiction must be concluded by the prayer of the plaintiff in his declaration, where he says:\u2014\nWherefore the plaintiff prays that the defendants may be jointly and severally condemned and adjudged to pay to the plaintiff the sum of $5,017.20, with interest from that date, etc.\nThis appeal is taken from the judgment of the Superior Court of the Province of Quebec, sitting in review, which confirmed the judgment of the Superior Court awarding damages in favour of plaintiff for the sum of $2,303.00. The jurisdiction of this Court depends upon the interpretation to be given to section 40 of the \"Supreme Court Act\" which reads as follows:\u2014\nIn the Province of Quebec an appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court from any judgment of the Superior Court in Review where that court confirms the judgment of the court of first instance, and its judgment is not appealable to the Court of King's Bench, but is appealable to His Majesty in Council.\nThis section of the statute had its origin in 54 & 55 Vict., ch. 25, sec. 3, and was passed to meet certain decisions of this court in which it had been held that no appeal lay from the Court of Review of Quebec, but only from the Court of King's Bench.\nTo determine our jurisdiction it is also necessary to consider the provision for appeal to His Majesty in Council from the Court of Review in the Province of Quebec.\nArticle 68 (3) of the Code of Civil Procedure provides as follows:\u2014\nAn appeal lies to His Majesty in His Privy Council from final judgments rendered in appeal by the Court of King's Bench:\n(1) In all cases where the matter in dispute relates to any fee of office, rent, revenue or any sum of money payable to His Majesty;\n(2) In cases concerning titles to lands or tenements, annual rents or other matters in which the rights in future of the parties may be affected;\n(3) In every other case where the amount or value of the thing\" demanded exceeds five thousand dollars.\nArticle 69 provides as follows:\u2014\nCauses adjudicated upon in review, which are susceptible of appeal to His Majesty in His Privy Council, but the appeal whereof to the Court of King's Bench is taken away by arts. 43 and 44, may, nevertheless, be appealed to His Majesty.\nThe present case is one in which an appeal to the Court of King's Bench is taken away by articles 43 and 44. We have, therefore, simply to determine whether this appeal is in a case where the amount or value of the thing demanded exceeds $5,000.\nPrevious to 8 Edw. VII., ch. 75, article 68 (3) of the Code of Civil Procedure read as follows:\u2014\nIn all other cases where the matter n dispute exceeds the sum or value of five hundred pounds sterling.\nThe question came up for determination under this sub-section of the article as to the interpretation to be placed upon the words \"matter in dispute,\" and the history of the decisions is somewhat curious.\nPrevious to the case of Allan v. Pratt[1], it had been held in this court and in the courts of Quebec that this language must be interpreted in the light of a provision of the Consolidated Statutes of Lower Canada, which provided as follows:\u2014\nWhenever the jurisdiction of the court or the right to appeal from any judgment of any court is dependent upon the amount in dispute, such amount shall be understood to be that demanded and not that recovered, if they are different;\nbut in Allan v. Pratt1, it was held that, in determining the right of appeal, the judgment is to be looked at as it affects the interests of the party who is prejudiced by it, and who seeks to relieve himself from it by appeal, and, therefore, it is not the amount claimed by the declaration, but the amount actually in controversy which determines the right to appeal.\nSubsequent to this decision, this Court, in Dufresne v. Gu\u00e9vremont[2] and Citizens Light and Power Co. v. Parent[3], refused to follow Allan v. Pratt1. All these earlier decisions, however, have no application to the present case. They were predicated upon the fact that the language of the Code was \"the matter in dispute exceeds, etc.,\" but now by the amendment, 8 Edw. VII., ch. 75, the matter is made clear, and it is \"the amount or value of the thing demanded\" which governs. The jurisprudence, both in this court and in the Province of Quebec, can now be made harmonious and uniform.\nIn the present case, therefore, the amount demanded in the declaration being over $5,000, although the judgment is only for the sum of $2,303, this court has jurisdiction to hear the appeal.\nIt has been decided here that the amount \"demanded\" is the amount claimed in the conclusion of the declaration. See Town of Outremont v. Joyce[4]; Dominion Salvage and Wrecking Co. v. Brown[5].\nIf I were free to deal with this motion without reference to our previous decisions, I would unhesitatingly come to the same conclusion on the literal construction of articles 68 and 69 of the Quebec Code of Procedure.\nThe general principle applicable to appeals in the French system of procedure is thus expressed in Dalloz, Repertoire Pratique vo. \"Appel,\" No. 50:\u2014\nPour determiner si une affaire exc\u00e8de ou non le taux du dernier ressort il faut se r\u00e9f\u00e9rer en principe au chiffre de la demande exprim\u00e9e dans les conclusions.\nAnd Rousseau, Lain\u00e9, vo. \"Appel,\" No. 64:\u2014\nEn principe, et cela ne se conteste plus aujourd'hui, c'est la somme demand\u00e9e et non le somme adjug\u00e9e que d\u00e9termine le premier ou dernier ressort.\nAnd at No. 73 the same author says:\u2014\nOn ne peut prendre pour base du dernier ressort que la somme r\u00e9clam\u00e9e. Elle seule fait l'objet de la contestation. Fuzier-Herman, vo. \"Appel,\" No. 182:\u2014\nLe taux de l'appel se calcuie sur la demande en instance et non sur la condamnation.\nAs I read articles 68 and 69 of the Quebec Code of Civil Procedure, an appeal is allowed to His Majesty in His Privy Council from final judgments rendered in appeal by the Court of King's Bench or the Court of Review: (1) In every, case where the amount or value of the thing demanded exceeds $5,000; (2) in cases where the matter in dispute relates to any fee of office, etc.; (3) in cases concerning titles to lands or tenements, etc.\nIn (1) the right to appeal depends upon the amount demanded in the case in which judgment is rendered. In (2) and (3) appeals are allowed where the matter in dispute relates to titles to lands, etc., fees of office, etc., irrespective of the amount demanded.\nIn (2) and (3) the matter in dispute must of necessity relate to the matter in dispute in the case. The judgment is appealable clearly because the matter in dispute in the case relates to titles to lands, etc., fees of office, etc. Why should the same interpretation not apply to (1)?\nIt is said that the word \"demanded\" does not mean \"demanded in the action\" or \"demanded by the declaration.\" With all deference, I submit that, when the appeal is contingent upon the amount demanded, articles 68 and 69 fix the appealable limit by reference to the amount demanded in the \"case\" or \"cause.\" Article 69 refers to \"causes\" adjudicated upon in review which (causes) are susceptible of appeal to His Majesty in His Privy Council, and article 68 (3), omitting the unnecessary words, provides in every other \"case\" where the amount demanded exceeds $5,000. This must surely mean the amount demanded in the \"case\" or \"cause.\" The word \"case\" is synonymous with \"cause,\" \"suit\" or \"action.\" Those words are used as convertible terms all through the Quebec Code of Procedure, v.g., articles 44 and 51, which deal with appeals to the Court of King's Bench and the Court of Review.\nIt is all made abundantly clear when we consider the French version of article 68. The language is:\u2014\nIl y a appel \u00e0 Sa Majest\u00e9 en son conseil priv\u00e9 de tout jugement final rendu par la cour du banc du roi:\n(1) Dans tous les cas o\u00f9 la mati\u00e8re en litige se rapporte \u00e0 quelque honoraire d'office, etc.;\n(2) Lorsqu'il s'agit de droits immobiliers, rentes, etc.;\n(3) Dans toute autre cause o\u00f9 le mordant ou la valeur de la chose r\u00e9clam\u00e9e excede la somme ou la valeur de cinq mille piastres;\nWhat is the grammatical construction of this last sentence (3), if not \"Dans toute autre cause dans laquelle\"; \"o\u00f9\"\u2014adverbe de lieu\u2014remplace \"lequel\" pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 d'une proposition.\nThe language is not perhaps very aptly chosen, but the meaning is clear.\nReference to the Code will shew that the jurisdiction of the different courts in the province is regulated by the amount demanded in the action. For instance, article 52 provides for an appeal in suits in which the sum claimed or value of the thing demanded is less than $500. It is not the amount of the judgment that regulates the appeal, but the appeal is from the final judgment in all suits or actions which are appealable. The action must involve an appealable claim, whatever may be the amount of the judgment.\nAs to the meaning of the word \"demand,\" I again submit that it has, in the Quebec Code, a well-settled meaning when used in the connection in which we find it in article 68(3), and connotes the claim of redress which the plaintiff makes against the defendant for or by reason of the facts which constitute the cause of action.\nBy the writ the defendant is summoned to appear and to answer to\nthe demand of the plaintiff contained in the annexed declaration.\nReference to the notes of Sewell C.J., in Pacquet v. Gaspard[6], in 1817, shews that the Code in article 68(3) uses language which had previously acquired a technical meaning.\nLet me also refer at random to some of the articles of the Quebec Code of Civil Procedure where the word is used, for instance, under the captions:\u2014\nJurisdiction, articles 54 and 59(2); Joinder of Issue, article 214; Incidental Proceedings, article 215; Confession of Judgment, article 527; Filing of Exhibits, articles 155, 157 and 174(5); Object of the Demand, article 124.\nThe motion should be dismissed with costs.\nDavies J.\u2014The only doubt which has been raised in my mind as to the proper disposition to be made of this motion to quash this appeal arises out of the decision of the Privy Council in the case of Allan v. Pratt[7]\nAs, however, was pointed out by Taschereau J., who delivered the judgment of this court in Dufresne v. Gu\u00e9vremont[8], the attention of the Judicial Committee does not appear to have been drawn in that case to article 2311, R.S.Q., which provides that\nWhenever the right to appeal is dependent upon the amount in dispute, such amount shall be understood to be that demanded and not that recovered, if they are different. I agree with the construction placed upon this article of the Code by this court in the case last cited, and I cannot but conclude that, had the attention of the Privy Council been called to this article of the Code, their decision in Allan v. Pratt[9] would have been different.\nI would, therefore, reading the article of the Code and the decision of this court above cited, in conjunction with section 46, sub-section 2, of the \"Supreme Court Act,\" affirm our jurisdiction and dismiss the motion.\nIdington J.\u2014I think, if for no other reason than out of consideration due to the probable reliance placed by those, including the Legislature of Quebec, concerned in such questions as involved herein, upon the decisions of this court in the cases of Dufresne v. Gu\u00e9vremont[10] and Citizens' Light and Power Co. v. Parent[11], we should feel bound thereby and dismiss this motion to quash with costs.\nDuff J. agreed that the motion to quash the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J. (dissenting).\u2014The respondent (plaintiff) moves to quash an appeal by the defendants to this court from the judgment of the Court of Review, affirming, on an appeal by the defendants the judgment at the trial for $2,303, on the grounds that the amount demanded by the plaintiff's declaration was less than $5,000 and that the sum \"demanded\" is that now in dispute, viz., the amount of the judgment in the trial court, against which the plaintiff did not appeal. By the conclusion of his declaration the plaintiff demanded $5,017.20 as damages for loss sustained by him through a fire, for which he asserts defendants were responsible. He now alleges that it is apparent on the face of an itemized statement of damages, filed with his declaration, that the sum of $5,017.20 was inserted in the conclusion of the latter as the result of mistake in computation or clerical error, and that the true amount sought to be recovered has always been $4,874.20. But at the trial he made no modification or reduction in the amount of his demand as stated in the conclusion to his declaration and he has not seen fit then or since to ask any amendment to correct this alleged error. For the purpose of this motion, the amount demanded in the action must, I think, be taken to be that stated in the conclusion of the declaration.\nThere remains the more important and difficult question whether the right of appeal is governed by the amount so demanded or by the amount of the judgment recovered, which alone is now in controversy, the plaintiff not attempting to appeal against it, and his claim for any larger sum being concluded against him by his failure to appeal from the judgment at the trial.\nThe Court of Review not being \"the highest court of final resort\" (\"Supreme Court Act,\" sec. 36) in the Province of Quebec, the right of appeal from it to this court depends upon section 40 of the \"Supreme Court Act\":\u2014\n40. In the Province of Quebec an appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court from any judgment of the Superior Court in Review where that court confirms the judgment of the court of first instance, and its judgment is not appealable to the Court of King's Bench, but is appealable to His Majesty in Council. Under this provision, assuming that the decision is not appealable to the Court of King's Bench (arts. 43 and 44 C.P.Q.), which is conceded, in order to establish a right of appeal from it to this court the only other condition prescribed is that it should be appealable to the Privy Council. Upon this question section 46(2) of the \"Supreme Court Act,\" which deals with appeals to this court from the court of last resort in the Province of Quebec, has no bearing.\nBy art. 69 (formerly 1178(a)) of the Quebec Code of Civil Procedure, it is enacted that:\nCases adjudicated upon in review, which are susceptible of appeal to His Majesty in his Privy Council, but the appeal whereof to the Court of King's Bench is taken away by articles 43 and 44; may, nevertheless, be appealed to His Majesty.\nSince 1908, by art. 68 C.P.Q., a right of appeal to His Majesty in Council is conferred\n(3) in every other case where the amount or value of the thing demanded exceeds five thousand dollars.\nArticle 68 C.P.Q. (formerly 1178 C.P.Q.), as it stood prior to 1908, by clause 3 conferred a right of appeal to the Privy Council\nin all other cases wherein the matter in dispute exceeds the sum or value of \u00a3500 sterling.\nArticle 2311 of the R.S.Q., 1888, was as follows:\u2014\nWhenever the right to appeal is dependent upon the amount in dispute, such amount shall be understood to be that demanded and not that recovered, if they are different.\nIn the Consolidated Statutes of Lower Canada (1860), ch. 77 (the Act respecting the Court of Queen's Bench), which, by section 52 (afterwards article 1178 C.P.Q.), prescribed the conditions of the right of appeal to the Privy Council, this provision (first enacted by 12 Vict., ch. 38, sec. 82), appeared as section 25, in the following terms:\u2014 Whenever the jurisdiction of the court, or the right to appeal from the judgment of any court, is dependent upon the amount in dispute, such amount should be understood to be that demanded and not that recovered, if they are different.\nThe same provision is also found in section 2 of chapter 82 of the same Consolidated Statutes, which has general application to the administration of justice.\n2. Whenever the jurisdiction of any court, or the right to appeal from any judgment of any court, is dependent upon the amount in dispute, such amount shall be understood to be that demanded, and not that recovered, if they be different; * * *\nIn Dufresne v. Gu\u00e9vremonV[12], in 1896, it was unanimously held by this court that article 2311 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec of 1888, applied to appeals to the Privy. Council. The same view had been taken by Dorion C.J. in Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Godbout[13], in 1877, in regard to section 25 of chapter 77 of the Consolidated Statutes of Lower Canada, and whatever might be thought had the provision been found only in that chapter (\"The Queen's Bench Act\"), its presence in chapter 82 of the Consolidated Statutes would seem to put it beyond doubt that this view is correct, although Gwynne J. expressed the contrary opinion in. Citizens' Light and Power Co. v. Parent[14]. In the revision of 1888 the portion of section 2 of chapter 82, C.S.L.C., above quoted, was dropped (vol. II., app. C, p. cxix.), no doubt because, in view of what Dorion C.J. had said as to the scope of section 25 of chapter 77 in Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Godbout13 and in Stanton v. The Home Ins. Co.[15], in 1879, it was thought unnecessary to duplicate the latter provision. With the law in this state, the Privy Council, in Allan v. Pratt[16], in 1888, held that\nThe measure of value for determining a defendant's right of appeal is the amount which the plaintiff recovered; when this falls short of the appealable amount, the court below cannot give leave to appeal;\nand on that ground the Judicial Committee dismissed the appeal in that case, where, upon a claim for $5,000, the recovery had been $1,100, notwithstanding that leave to appeal had been granted by the Court of King's Bench. The Board followed its prior decision in Macfarlane v. Leclaire[17], in which the basis of the right of appeal to the Privy Council had been held to be not the amount demanded in the action (in that case \u00a3417 0s. 8d.), but the extent to which the judgment affected the interest of the party prejudiced by it and seeking to relieve himself from it by appeal.\nIn Richer v. Voyer[18] the plaintiff's claim was for $2,061.67 with interest. By the judgment, interest and costs being added to capital, he recovered a sum in excess of \u00a3500 sterling. The Court of King's Bench refused to allow an appeal to the Privy Council on the ground that the amount demanded in the action was less than \u00a3500 sterling, although it had apparently taken the contrary view in Bellerose v. Hart[19]. The Privy Council, however, granted a petition for leave to appeal to it. The ground upon which it did so does not appear in any report of the case that I have been able to find. But in Stanton v. Home Ins, Co.[20] Dorion C.J. says that leave was granted on the ground that, by adding interest and costs (which were included in the judgment), the amount in dispute was over \u00a3500 sterling. He adds that, in his opinion, that was contrary to the course of decisions in this country and to the statute (C.S.L.C., ch. 75, sec. 25). See, too, Beullac, Code of Civil Procedure, p. 84, No. 24.\nIn Quebec Fire Assurance Co. v. Anderson[21], in 1860, the Privy Council granted leave to appeal on an allegation that, with interest and costs added to the principal sum recovered on an insurance policy, a sum amounting to \u00a3635 currency, which exceeded \u00a3500 sterling, was in issue. But, upon the respondent shewing an error in this calculation, the leave was discharged[22]. In this case the petition for leave expressly stated that\nBy the Lower Canada Act, 12 Vict. eh. 38, sec. 82, the right of appeal depended upon the amount demanded and not the amount recovered.\nThe whole report shews that leave was granted, not as an exercise of the royal prerogative, but because, in the opinion of the Board, appealability de plano depended on the amount involved in the appeal.\nIn Boswell v. Kilborn[23], in 1859, the claim was for \u00a3600 currency (less than \u00a3500 sterling), and the Court of Queen's Bench refused leave to appeal to the Privy Council on that ground. But the Judicial Committee granted leave to appeal\nfirst, because by the law of Canada interest ran with the judgment, which would bring the subject-matter within the appealable value.\nNo direct allusion is made in the Macfarlane Case[24] or in Allan v. Pratt[25] either to section 25 of chapter 77 or to section 2 of chapter 82 of the Consolidated Statutes of Lower Canada, 1860, and we are asked to assume that in both these cases this statutory provision escaped the notice of the Judicial Committee itself as well as that of counsel. In view of the decisions in Dufresne v. Gu\u00e9vremont[26], Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Godbout[27], and Stanton v. Home Ins. Co.[28], we can scarcely suppose that it was regarded as wholly inapplicable to appeals to the Privy Council. In Stanton v. The Home Ins. Co.28 Dorion C.J., in delivering judgment in the Court of Queen's Bench, referring to Richer v. Voyer[29], said that in that case\nThe attention of the Privy Council perhaps had not been drawn to the statute (C.S.L.C., c. 77, s. 25), and it might be well that it should be put before them on the next occasion.\nHow this statute could have escaped attention in Richer v. Voyer29 it is difficult to conceive, since in that case leave to appeal to the Privy Council had been refused by the Court of King's Bench on the ground that the amount demanded by the declaration and not that recovered determined the right of appeal. The same observation may be made upon Boswell v. Kilborn[30]. In Quebec Fire Ins. Co. v. Anderson[31] the statute 12 Vict., ch. 38, sec. 82 (re-enacted by C.S.L.C. (1860), ch. 77, sec. 25, and ch. 82, sec. 2) was expressly brought to their Lordships' attention; and, having regard to what was said by Dorion C.J. in Stanton v. Home Ins. Co.28, it is scarcely credible that if the statute had escaped attention in Richer v. Voyer29, in Boswell v. Kilborn30, and also in Macfarlane v. Leclaire[32], it was again entirely overlooked in Allan v. Pratt[33]. Although Taschereau J. made that assumption in Dufresne v. Gu\u00e9vremont[34] (wrongly, Gwynne J. suggests, in Citizens' Light and Power Co. v. Parent[35]), the Quebec Court of Appeal, in Glengoil S.S. Co. v. Pilkington[36], in 1897, with the judgment in Dufresne v. Gu\u00e9vremont34 before it, and with article 2311, R.S.Q., 1888, in mind, holding itself bound by the decisions of the Privy Council in Macfarlane v. Leclaire[37] and in Allan v. Pratt[38], refused to allow an appeal to the Privy Council because the amount of the judgment was less than \u00a3500 sterling, although the plaintiff's demand in his declaration exceeded that amount. The Court evidently thought that it should not assume that two statutory provisions, one of them at least (sec. 2 of ch. 82, C.S.L.C.) unquestionably bearing upon this much debated question, had been entirely overlooked on each occasion when that question was before the Judicial Committee. If those statutory provisions were brought to the attention of the Board, as they undoubtedly were in the Anderson Case[39], and as I think we should assume they were in the other cases, unless they were deemed wholly irrelevant, which we cannot assume in view of the decisions to the contrary here and in Quebec and of what took place in Anderson's Case39 and in Richer v. Voyer[40], its decisions must mean that, notwithstanding the declaration of the provincial legislature (which.it was competent to make), Cuvillier v.Aylwin[41] that the amount in dispute\nshall be understood to be that demanded and not that recovered, if they are different, the right to appeal de plano to the Privy Council shall, in the case of an appeal by a defendant, be determined by the amount recovered, because the amount demanded may, and should be, held to mean that demanded on the appeal, i.e., the amount or value of the matter in controversy in the appeal, and in such a case the only relief sought is from a condemnation for the amount of the judgment. On an appeal by a plaintiff, on the other hand, from a judgment of dismissal, the whole sum claimed in the declaration may be demanded on the appeal, and, unless the claim is modified, is in fact the amount in dispute. Where a plaintiff merely seeks to increase the amount of a judgment in his favour, the case may be different. A similar view of the construction of the like provision of the \"Supreme Court Act\" (sub-section 4 of section 29 of chapter 135, R.S.C., 1886, added by 54 & 55 Vict., ch. 25, sec. 3; now sub-section 2 of section 46) was unanimously taken by this court in Beauchemin v. Armstrong[42], in 1904, where an appeal by a defendant against a judgment for $631 of costs in an action in which the original claim was for $2,217 was quashed on the ground that \"the interest of the party appealing was less than $2,000,\" the court expressly following Allan v. Pratt[43] and Monnette v. Lefebvre[44], in 1889. This judgment was delivered by Taschereau C.J., who had delivered the judgment of the court in Dufresne v. Gu\u00e9vremont[45] and of the majority in Citizens' Light Co. v. Parent[46].\nIn Dufresne v. Fee[47] the same learned Chief Justice would distinguish Beauchemin v. Armstrong[48] on the ground that\nit was not a case where there was \u00e0 difference between the amount demanded and that recovered.\nThe decision in Allan v. Pratt[49] would also appear to have been followed by this Court in Kennedy v. Gallagher[50], decided on October 6th, 1908. The claim in that case was for $10,400; the recovery, $1,800. The defendants appealed from the judgment of the Court of Review. Their appeal was quashed. Mr. Cameron suggests a possibility that the case may have proceeded on another ground.\nIt seems difficult to escape the conclusion that in the foregoing cases (with the exception of Dufresne v. Gu\u00e9vremont[51], in which, although the question as to the right of appeal was the same as that in Richer v. Voyer[52], the allowance of an appeal by the Privy Council in that case was apparently not brought to the attention of the court, Citizens' Light and Power Co. v. Parent[53], which followed Dufresne v. Gu\u00e9vremont51 and Dufresne v. Fee[54]), the word \"demanded\" in article 2311 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec, 1888 (sec. 25 of ch. 27 and sec. 2 of ch. 82 in the C.S.L.C., 1860), was construed as meaning \"demanded or in controversy on the appeal.\" In Came v. Consolidated Car Heating Co.[55], in 1901, the Court of King's Bench again recognized the rule that the quantum of the interest of the appellant determines the value of the matter in dispute for purposes of the appeal to the Privy Council. In this case leave to appeal was afterwards granted by the Privy Council apparently on the ground that the value of the rights in dispute, apart from the claim for damages, exceeded \u00a3500 sterling. (Note, p. 258.)\nThe rule in Allan v. Pratt[56] was also accepted by the Court of Review in Marchand v. Molleur[57], in 1893.\nWith the law in this state, the Quebec Legislature by 8 Edw. VII., ch. 75, substituted for clause 3 of article 68, C.P.Q., which had formerly read as follows:\u2014\n(3) In all other cases wherein a matter in dispute exceeds the sum or value of \u00a3500 sterling\nthe following:\u2014\n(3) In all other cases where the amount or value of the thing demanded exceeds the value of $5,000.\nIn the revision of the Quebec statutes in 1909 article 2311 of the R.S.Q., 1888, is not found, having been repealed by ch. 37 of the statutes of 1908.\nThe question now presented is whether, as a result of the substitution in clause 3 of article 68, C.P.Q., of the words \"the amount or value of the thing demanded\" for \"the matter in dispute,\" appealability to the Privy Council no longer depends upon the amount of the interest of the appellant, but is to be determined, alike in the case of plaintiff and defendant, solely by the amount claimed in the declaration, regardless of the value of the matter in controversy on the appeal\u2014with the result that in ah action in which $5,001 has been claimed, the defendant would be entitled to appeal de plano to the Privy Council, although judgment had been recovered for some very trifling sum and the plaintiff had acquiesced therein.\nIn the only reported case since 1908 that I have found, although in his reasons for judgment Jett\u00e9 C.J. says: \"The sum demanded by the action determines the jurisdiction * * *,\" in the formal judgment the refusal of leave is based upon the fact that \"the amount in controversy does not exceed $5,000.\" Contrary to the view of the Privy Council, in Richer v. Voyer[58] and Quebec Fire Ins. Co. v. Anderson[59], in 1860, the court refused to take costs into account in considering the amount in controversy for purposes of appeal. The judgment also rests, however, on the ground that the proceeding had been taken under the \"Winding-up Act,\" and that it does not authorize an appeal to the Privy Council: Lapierre v. La Banque de St. Jean[60], in 1910.\nBut if the proper inference from the earlier cases is that, for purposes of appeal to the Privy Council, the word \"demanded\" in section 25 of chapter 77 and section 2 of chapter 82 of the Consolidated Statutes of Lower Canada, 1860 (R.S.Q., 1888, art. 2311) had been construed to mean \"demanded or in controversy on the appeal,\" so that under that provision the value of the interest of the appellant determined the right to appeal, the same construction should be put upon the word \"demanded\" in the new clause 3 of article 68 C.P.Q., there being nothing in the context to forbid it. Greaves v. Tofield[61]; Avery v. Wood[62]; Jay v. Johnstone[63]; Joyce v. Hart[64]; Casgrain v. Atlantic and North-West Railway Co.[65]. If by the change made in 1908 the legislature meant to enact that the right of appeal should for the future depend upon the amount claimed in the declaration, in view of the existing jurisprudence we should have expected to find it make use of some unmistakable phrase to express that intention, such as \"demanded in the action,\" or \"demanded by the declaration,\" instead of the bare and equivocal word \"demanded,\" shorn even of the words which formerly accompanied it, \"and not that recovered, if they be different,\" which were at least indicative, one would have thought, of an intention to use \"demanded\" in the sense of \"demanded in the action or by the declaration,\" but were apparently deemed insufficient to warrant giving that construction to it in view of the unsatisfactory basis of appeal to the Privy Council which would result.\nHaving regard to the reasons assigned by the Judicial Committee in Macfarlane v. Leclaire[66] and Allan v. Pratt[67] for holding that the right of appeal to the Privy Council should depend upon the amount of the appellant's interest, I would not be prepared to give to the word \"demanded\" in clause 3 of article 68 C.P.Q. the meaning \"demanded in the action,\" even if I were satisfied that the predecessors of article 2311 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec, 1888, had been entirely overlooked in those cases or had been deemed inapplicable, because, to do so, would overturn well-settled jurisprudence with revolutionary consequences, and because that is not the only meaning of which \"demanded\" is reasonably susceptible.\nIn Macfarlane v. Leclaire66 the statute 34 Geo. III, ch. 6, sec. 30, upon which the right of appeal depended, declared final the judgment of the Court of Appeals\nin all cases where the matter in dispute shall not exceed \u00a3500 sterling : but in cases exceeding that sum or value * * * an appeal shall lie to His Majesty in his Privy Council though the immediate sum or value appealed for be less than \u00a3500 sterling *.**. Nevertheless their Lordships said :\u2014\nIn determining the question of the value of the matter in dispute upon which the right to appeal depends, their Lordships consider the correct course to adopt is to look at the judgment as it affects the interests of the parties who are prejudiced by it, and who seek to relieve themselves from it by an appeal. If their liability upon the judgment is of an amount sufficient to entitle them to appeal, they cannot be deprived of their right because the matter in dispute happens not to be of equal value to both parties and, therefore, if the judgment had been in their favour, their adversary might possibly have had no power to question it by an appeal.\nThe right of appeal was maintained, although the original claim had been only for \u00a3417 0s. 8d. currency, because \"the effect of the judgment was to place in jeopardy\" goods for which \u00a31,642 currency had been paid, \"and it is the immediate effect of the judgment which must be regarded.\"\nThe principle of this decision, their Lordships held, governed Allan v. Pratt[68].\nIf (as I think they should) the decisions of the Judicial Committee above mentioned should be taken to have put upon the word \"demanded\" used in the sections of the Consolidated Statutes to which I have referred the meaning \"demanded or in controversy in the appeal,\" as was understood by the Court of King's Bench in Glengoil S. S. Co. v. Pilkington[69], and apparently also by our own court in Beauchemin v. Armstrong[70], and Kennedy v. Gallagher[71], a contrary intention not being clearly apparent, the legislature should be deemed to have used the same word in a subsequent statute dealing with such appeals with the meaning thus attached to it. I am, for these reasons, of the opinion that unless the interest of the appellant\u2014the amount demanded or in controversy in the appeal\u2014exceeds $5,000, no right of appeal to the Privy Council is conferred by articles 69 and 68 (3), C.P.Q., and that the respondent's motion to quash should therefore be granted.\nMotion dismissed with costs.\n[1] 13 App. Cas. 780.\n1 13 App. Cas. 780.\n[2] 26 Can.

Diplock, (1916) 53 S.C.R. 376\nDate: 1916-05-25\nThe Canadian Northern Railway Company (Defendants) Appellants;\nand\nNorman Diplock (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1916: May 10; 1916: May 25.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies, Idington, Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF SASKATCHEWAN.\nRailways\u2014Negligence\u2014Ejecting trespasser from moving train\u2014Imprudence\u2014Liability for act of servant.\nAs a train was moving away from a station, where it had stopped, the conductor ordered a brakesman to eject two trespassers from it. On proceeding to do so the brakesman found a man stealing a ride upon the narrow ledge of the engine-tender and, in a scuffle which ensued, the plaintiff, who was on the edge of the ledge but was not seen by the brakesman owing to the darkness was pushed off the train and injured. In an action for damages, the jury found that the brakesman had been at fault in attempting to eject the man whom he saw while the train was in motion and that it was \"dubious\" whether he was aware of the presence of the plaintiff in the dangerous position.\nHeld, per Fitzpatrick C.J. and Idington and Anglin JJ. (affirming judgment appealed from (9 West. W.R. 1052)), that the reckless indifference of the brakesman, in circumstances in which he ought to have been aware of the presence of the plaintiff, was a negligent act for which the railway company was liable.\nPer Davies and Brodeur. JJ. dissenting.\u2014As it was not shewn by the evidence nor found by the jury that the brakesman was aware of the presence of the plaintiff in a dangerous position the plaintiff, being a trespasser, could not recover damages against the company for the injuries he sustained.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan[1], affirming the judgment entered at the trial by Elwood J., on the findings of the jury, in favour of the plaintiff for damages assessed at $1,730 with costs.\nThe circumstances of the case are stated in the head-note.\nO. H. Clark K.C. for the appellants.\nChrysler K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The questions submitted to the jury are so involved and so numerous as to lead necessarily to unsatisfactory results. They do not, however, appear to have been objected to.\nFrom the answers we must assume the following facts are found: (a) that plaintiff, stealing a ride on the company's train, sought refuge on the ledge of the tender with the witness Thacker; (b) that the brakesman Wagner knew that both men were on the team when it started from the station; (c) that, instructed by the conductor to put them both off, he went forward and ordered them both off; (d) that Wagner, without any attempt at investigation to ascertain the relative positions of the men, shoved Thacker off and in so doing shoved the plaintiff off also; (e) that the reasonable and probable result of Thacker being put off was that plaintiff would go also and that the speed of the train made it dangerous to put the men off at the time.\nBoth plaintiff and Thacker were trespassing, but, although the general principle is that a man trespasses at his own risk, it is undoubted that in this instance it was the duty of the railway officials when aware of the presence of the two trespassers not to put them off in such a manner as to endanger their safety. Section 281 of the \"Railway Act,\" although not directly in point here, is an application of this general principle, particularly when read with the instructions of the company that the train should be stopped before putting anybody off.\nWhether, in the circumstances, Wagner was acting within the scope of his employment in view of the evidence is doubtful, but the point was not raised either here or below and he apparently thought that he had the authority of the conductor. Vide Hutchins v. London City Council[2].\nThere is no doubt that on the findings of the jury, and there is ample evidence to support them, unnecessary violence was used towards Thacker and his removal from the train in the circumstances endangered his safety. If the accident had happened to Thacker there would be little doubt that he would have his recourse against the company. Now, as to the plaintiff, Wagner had reason to believe that both men were together, otherwise he would not have ordered them both off. And in shoving Thacker off the train improperly he caused the injury of which plaintiff complains. If Wagner Was acting within the scope of his employment, and this apparently is not denied, plaintiff must succeed. The principle of law is that a tort-feasor must be assumed to have contemplated and be liable for all those injuries which result from the wrongful act together with such incidents as a reasonable man might in the circumstances have expected to result in the ordinary course of nature. Fletcher v. Smith[3], in 1877, at pages 787, 788; Ratcliffe v. Evans[4]. The rule of the ordinary course of nature and probable consequences \"is after all only a guide to the exercise of common sense.\" And the jury have found on the evidence that the fall of plaintiff from the train was the reasonable and probable consequence or result of the violence used improperly to eject Thacker. When we consider the dark night, the narrow ledge on which both men stood, the unnecessary violence of Wagner's attack on Thacker and his knowledge of the plaintiff's presence somewhere on the ledge, the finding of the jury must be sustained.\nI would dismiss with costs.\nDavies J. (dissenting).\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan affirming the judgment for the plaintiff entered by the trial judge on the findings of the jury. Mr. Justice Newlands dissented on the ground that the plaintiff was one of two trespassers stealing rides upon the railway train and that the trespasser's only right in such cases is that\nthe railway company must not wilfully injure him or unnecessarily and knowingly increase the normal risk by deliberately placing unexpected dangers in the way\nand that it had not been proved or found by the jury that the company or its servants had done so.\nThe admitted facts are that the plaintiff and one Thacker were stealing rides upon the appellant's railway and were discovered by the conductor while the train stopped at Hanley Station, a small side station on the railway line. The conductor ordered them off the train and they got off and walked across the track to the east side and hid themselves behind some box cars there. The plaintiff says that as soon as the train began to move he and Thacker climbed on again between the tender of the engine and the baggage car, Thacker going ahead, and that when he (Diplock) got up, Thacker had already taken up a position alongside of the ladder which ran down the centre of the back of the tender and that he was standing on the ledge of the tender. He says:\nThacker was holding on to the ladder and he (Diplock). was holding on to the hand-rail at the outside.\nHis position was either on the ledge of the tender or on the steps leading to it. The only light there was what was shining out of the car door. The brakesman says he only saw \"just one man\" on the back of that tender, that he \"did not know that the other man was on the outside on the west side\" and that he \"did not see him at the time.\"\nNow whether the plaintiff was actually upon the ledge holding on the hand-rail or was on the step and so holding is uncertain. The jury did not find that he either saw or should have seen him though they answered the question whether he should have investigated where Diplock was before shoving off Thacker in the affirmative. Answering the question of fact \"whether Wagner knew that Diplock was in the position he was\" they say \"dubious.\" The question whether he should have investigated and found out is one of law, not of fact for the jury. The facts as stated by the brakesman are that, when he opened the door of the baggage car, he saw only one man on the ledge, that he called to him and asked him to come in the car; that the man refused, and he (Wagner) grappled with him and pushed him off. It may well be that if Thacker who was seen by Wagner and pushed by him had been injured the company would under the findings of the jury as to the dangerous rate of speed of the train have been liable to him in damages. But how can that liability arise with respect to a trespasser whose presence there the brakesman did not know of ? The jury were unable to find that Wagner knew that Diplock was in the position he was. Without such a finding, it is impossible for me to hold that the company should be held liable.\nPlaintiff was a trespasser. He was trespassing at his own risk. The company was undoubtedly under a duty not wilfully to injure him. But how could they be said to have wilfully injured him when they did not know of his presence there? It is said they must be held to have known because the conductor told the brakesman there were two men stealing a ride and to put them off. But the brakesman swears that when he went to put them off he only saw one man and did not see the other. The jury cannot have disbelieved him or they could not have found it was. \"dubious\" whether Wagner knew that Diplock was in the position he was if the knowledge of Diplock's position at the time he pushed Thacker off was known to Wagner, the brakesman, there might be a very strong contention made that the company was liable for damages to Diplock for any injuries he sustained on the ground that he had been wilfully injured by Wagner's improper and illegal action. But he could only recover in cases where there was either wilful injury caused to him or where the deliberate action of one of the company's servants placed unexpected dangers in his way. The company could not be held liable to a trespasser for the mere negligence of their servants. There must be much more than negligence. There must be deliberate or wilful wrongful action causing the injuries complained of.\nIf Wagner did not know and, in the absence of a finding to the contrary, we should accept the evidence that he did not, then no such responsibility arises.\nI am quite at a loss to understand how it can be successfully argued that because the brakesman was told to go and put off two men who were stealing rides and in discharging that duty he found only one man that he was bound before putting that one off to institute a search for the other. He may well have assumed that when he gave the order to the man he did see to get off the other man whom he did not see obeyed it. But whether that be so or not he neither saw nor knew of the presence of, the other man (the plaintiff) and therefore owed him no duty.\nThe law on the subject of the liability of a railway company is laid down by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the case of Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Barnett[5], at page 369, as follows:\u2014\nThe railway company was undoubtedly under a duty to the plaintiff not wilfully to injure him; they were not entitled, unnecessarily and knowingly to increase the normal risk by deliberately placing unexpected dangers in his way, but to say that they were liable to a trespasser for the negligence of their servants is to place them under a duty to him of the same character as that which they undertake to those whom they carry for reward. The authorities do not justify the imposition of any such obligation in such circumstances. A carrier cannot protect himself against the consequences which may follow on the breach of such an obligation (as for instance, by a charge to cover insurance against the risk), for there can be no contracts with trespassers; nor can he prevent the supposed obligation from arising by keeping the trespasser off his premises, for a trespasser seeks no leave and gives no notice.\nThe general rule, therefore, is that a man trespasses at his own risk. This is shewn by a long line of authorities, of which Great Northern Ry. Co. v. Harrison[6], Lygo v. Newbold[7] and Murley v. Grove[8], are familiar examples.\nAccepting this law and applying it to the findings of the jury and the facts as admitted, I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed with costs. Idington, J.\u2014 The respondent and one Thacker were stealing a ride on appellant's train. When, as it was starting, the conductor said to the brakesman, Wagner,\nThere are two men on the end of the car; go and put them off.\nIt was at night time. The men were standing on the ledge of the tender next the baggage car. Wagner proceeded to the place indicated and tried ineffectually to get Thacker into the baggage car and then said to him \"well get off\" and gave him a shove which had the desired effect.\nThe jury find the train was then moving at a speed such as to make it dangerous for him to alight. The result upon respondent of the shoving of Thacker by Wagner appears in the answers to the questions, as follows:\u2014\n1. Q. Was the plaintiff injured by the wheels of the C.N.R train passing over his feet? A. Yes.\n2. Q. How did he get under the train? A. Result of being pushed.\n(a) Q. Did Wagner assault Thacker by kicking or pushing? A. Yes.\n(b) Q. Where was Diplock when Wagner attacked Thacker? A. On ledge of tender, west of Thacker.\n(c) Q. Was the reasonable and probable result of Wagner kicking or pushing Thacker that Diplock would be pushed off the train? A. Yes.\n(d) Q. Did Diplock fall off the train as a result? A. Yes.\n(e) Q. Was that the cause of his injury? A. Yes.\n(f) Q. Was Wagner's conduct towards Thacker adopted with the object of putting Thacker off the train? A. Yes.\n(g), Q. If yes, was Wagner acting in course of his employment? A. Yes.\n(h) Q. Did Wagner know that Diplock was in the position he was? A. Dubious.\n(i) Q. If he did not know, should he have investigated to find out where Diplock was before he shoved or kicked Thacker? A. Yes.\nThe other questions and answers relevant to the issues involved in these are as follows:\u2014 (m) Q. Was the speed of the train when ordered to get off such as to make it dangerous for him to alight? A. Yes.\n(n) Q. Did Wagner know it was dangerous, or should he have known, having regard to all the circumstances? A. Yes.\n(o) Q. Was the conduct of Wagner reasonable and proper? A. No.\n(p) Q. Was Wagner, in ordering Thacker and Diplock off the train acting in the course of his employment? A. Yes.\nThe finding of the jury as to the rate of speed of the train shews it was an unlawful assault and battery that was thus committed upon Thacker by Wagner. As a legal result thereof he and his employers are liable for the consequences thereof to others.\nThis is not a case of negligence in which other considerations might have been involved as in Grand Trunk Railway Company v. Barnett[9], so much discussed in the case.\n. It is the law involved in the well known squib case Scott v. Shepherd[10], that should be our guide herein subject to the qualifications to be found as the result of later development of the law resting upon the principle laid down in that case.\nThe above question (c) and answer thereto seems to me to cover all that need concern us as to these qualifications.\nThe undisputed terms of the conductor's order indicated to the brakesman that there were two men at the place where the scuffle was had and that both were to be dealt with. Thus the answer of the jury was amply justified by the facts.\nThe questions of wilfulness and actual accurate knowledge of how these men stood though much discussed below and in argument here and held by the jury \"dubious\" seems to me beside the question.\nAssuming in such case the brakesman had, as I imagine probable, authority to arrest Thacker and hand him over to the police as a trespasser and had been merely discharging that lawful duty, when a scuffle ensued as result of Thacker's resistance, and the respondent had as part of the consequences accidentally been knocked off the car and injured he, as a trespasser, could have had no remedy.\nI assume in stating the law thus that there had been in such supposed case no undue violence on the part of the brakesman and that he had been duly and properly discharging his duty to arrest and keep Thacker in charge.\nI desire only to illustrate the wide difference that exists between the case of a man doing an unlawful act and that of a man doing a perfectly legal act.\nIn the latter case knowledge and wilfulness might have a very important bearing in determining the consequences of what one so placed should be held liable for in a way that is not open to him doing an unlawful act to urge on his behalf.\nThere was much made in argument, and by the learned judge who dissented in the court below, of the inconsistent nature of the questions first put and later by reason of the learned trial judge putting the following question:\u2014\n(j) Q. If Diplock jumped from the train and was not shoved off did he jump because of any order or command of Wagner? A. Yes.\nIf there had been nothing else in the case than this question and some others following it evidently related thereto or intended to be so there would have to be a new trial to determine the fact of whether Diplock in fact did jump in obedience to what was said and was not pushed off for strangely enough there was no question put to elicit the fact. The putting of such an hypothetical case and getting an answer thereto leads nowhere.\nHowever, the whole of these academic questions relative to an assumption of jumping off are rendered harmless as they are needless by the express answer to the second question and others I have quoted.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014Very reluctantly, because of the unmeritorious features of the plaintiffs case and because I realize and appreciate the grave dangers and difficulties to which trainmen are exposed in dealing with such characters as the plaintiff and his companion, Thacker, when stealing rides on trains, I have reached the conclusion, that this appeal cannot succeed. A perusal of the record has left me under the impression that, if trying it without a jury, I should not improbably have dismissed the action on the ground that it had not been satisfactorily shewn that the plaintiff was injured as a result of what took place between the brakesman, Wagner, and Thacker. But findings of the jury which have not been seriously attacked establish that the plaintiff was pushed or forced off the defendant company's train, while it was travelling at a speed which made it dangerous for him to alight, as the result of an attempt made by Wagner, in carrying out orders of the conductor, to force the plaintiff's companion Thacker off the train.\nI fully agree that if Wagner had not had reason to believe that the plaintiff, Diplock, was in the narrow and admittedly dangerous space between the tender of the engine and the baggage car, when he pushed or shoved Thacker, no liability to Diplock would have been incurred. The plaintiff was a trespasser and liability to him would not arise from any mere negligence. But the railway company's employee was not on that account\nentitled unnecessarily and knowingly to increase the normal risk by placing unexpected danger in his way.\nGrand Trunk Railway v. Barnett[11], at page 369.\nThe jury has not found that Wagner knew \"that Diplock was in the position he was.\" They have found that \"he should have investigated\" to find where Diplock was before he \"shoved or kicked Thacker.\" Wagner's evidence is that, as the train was about to leave Hanley Station, the conductor said to him,\nThere are two men on the end of the car; go and put them off.\nHe immediately proceeded to do so. He opened the door of the baggage car and saw Thacker standing on a ledge at the back of the tender. He could see only one-half of the back of the tender. The light was weak and uncertain. He says he did not know that the other man was on the west side and that he could not see him. Although he \"assumed\" there were two men there, he did not take any steps to locate the second man. He did not concern himself about him.\nReading the jury's findings in the light of this evidence, I understand them to mean that, although Wagner did not see Diplock and did not know his exact position, he had reason to believe that he was somewhere in the narrow space between the tender and the baggage car and acted on that assumption, and that in failing to look for him before wrongfully dealing with Thacker in a way which necessarily increased the risk to anybody else in the perilous position in which he had reason to believe the plaintiff might be, he had disregarded the right which even a trespasser has that he should not be wantonly or recklessly exposed to unnecessary risk by one who has reason to believe that his acts will have that effect. The duty of a common carrier to a trespasser is thus stated by Bailey J. of the Supreme Court of Illinois in Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad Co. v. Mehlsack[12], at page 20:\u2014\nHis duty rests merely upon the grounds of general humanity and respect for the rights of others, and requires him to so perform the transportation service as not wantonly or carelessly to be an aggressor towards third persons whether such persons are on or off the vehicle.\nAn, observation of Lord Robson, at page 371 of the report of Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Barnett[13], is apt to mislead. Referring to the speech of the Earl of Halsbury in Lowery v. Walker[14], at page 13 he quotes His Lordship as having said that\nthe word \"trespasser\" would have carried the learned counsel for the defendant ail the way he wants to get\ni.e., one would infer from the use made of this passage, to the conclusion of non-liability: But the rest of Lord Halsbury's sentence was\nto a somewhat difficult and intricate question of law upon which various views might be entertained.\nIn the same case Lord Shaw of Dumferline had pointedly withheld his assent to the pronouncements of Darling J. and Vaughan-Williams L.J., in the lower courts, as to immunity for injuries caused to mere trespassers.\nWagner, though aware of Diplock's probable presence in a position of peril, seems to have allowed himself to be carried away by excitement, caused, no doubt, by Thacker's successful resistance to his efforts to draw him within the baggage car and, with reckless indifference to the consequences either to Thacker or to Diplock, tried to push the former off the train. His attitude towards Diplock is probably correctly expressed in his answer\nI did not bother my head about him.\nUnder these circumstances I think the verdict and judgment for the plaintiff should not be disturbed.\nBrodeur.J. (dissenting).\u2014The jury in their verdict have not found that the brakesman Wagner knew that the respondent, Diplock, was in the position he was in when Wagner tried to push Diplock's companion off the car. Diplock had no business to be on the car of the appellant company; he was even stealing a ride at the time.\nThe Privy Council in the case of Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Barnett[15], has decided that\nalthough the common carriers are under a duty to a trespasser not wilfully to injure him, they are not liable to him for mere negligence and that as the accident was due to the negligence of the carrier's servants and not to any wilful act the trespasser was not entitled to recover.\nApplying that decision to the present case I find that the plaintiff respondent was not wilfully injured because the jury have been unable to state in their verdict whether the brakesman knew that Diplock was there.\nI think the appeal should be allowed and that the action should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Borland, McIntyre, McAughey & Mowat.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Bence, Stevenson & McLorg.\n[1] 9 West.

Dufresne v, Guevremont (26 Can. S.C.R. 216), followed.\nMOTION to quash an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Review, at Montreal[1], affirming the judgment entered at the trial, in the Superior Court, District of Montreal, by Greenshields J., on the findings of the jury, in favour of the plaintiff, with costs.\nThe action was brought to recover damages for personal injuries sustained by the plaintiff through the alleged negligence of the company and, by the conclusions off his declaration, the plaintiff claimed five thousand dollars with interest and \"costs of suit, including costs of exhibits.\" Before instituting the action the plaintiff, as required by statute, served a notice on the defendants claiming compensation and it appeared that, in the event of the action being maintained, there would be a fee payable on the notice and the cost of service amounted to seventy-five cents. On the hearing of the motion to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction, under section 40 of the \"Supreme Court Act,\" R.S.C., 1906, ch. 139, it was contended by the appellants that the amount of the fee on the notice and of the cost of serving it should be considered part of the demande and, being added to the amount of the damages claimed, would bring the amount of the controversy over the sum necessary to give the right of appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council under articles 68 (3) and 69 of the Code of Civil Procedure and, consequently, the appeal would lie to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nCallaghan supported the motion.\nMeredith K.C. contra.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014Apparently a nice question of jurisdiction arises in this case. The conclusion of the declaration is:\u2014\nThe plaintiff prays for judgment against the defendants for the said sum of $5,000, with interest from this date and costs of suit, including costs of exhibits.\nArticles 68 (3) and 69 of the Code of Civil Procedure give an appeal from the Court of Review to the Privy Council in every case\nwhere the amount or value of the thing demanded exceeds five thousand dollars.\nIn the case of Dufresne v. Gu\u00e9vremont[2], the declaration seems to have concluded with much the same language, viz.\u2014the plaintiff sued, on the 26th December, 1893, for $2,150 with interest at 8% per annum from date of action till paid, with costs. The Supreme Court held that the claim as set out in the declaration was only for $2,150 and that although the interest was claimed in the declaration it could not be looked at for the purpose of considering whether the amount claimed was more than \u00a3500.\nThe appellants here urge that we must add to the amount claimed in the conclusions of the declaration the fee on the notice of action served on the company and the bailiff's charges for making the service. But, as both these items are included in the costs taxable as between party and party, we do not think they can be considered in determining whether or not the amount claimed is within the appealable limit.\nThe motion to quash is granted.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\n[1] Q.R. 49 S.C. 326.\n[2] 20 Can.

The clause is set out in the above head-note.\nA.C. McMaster and J.H. Fraser for the appellants. By the general devise in the beginning of his will the testator created a trust which governs all that follows: Buckle v. Bristow[2]; and the trustees cannot take beneficially: Briggs v. Penny[3], at pages 556-7.\nThe daughters are in no way pointed out as objects of the testator\u2019s bounty. See In re Smith[4]. Yeap Cheah Neo v. Ong Cheng Neo[5]; and McDermott v. Anderson[6] were also cited.\nHellmuth K.C. for the respondents referred to In re Howell; Liggins v. Buckingham[7].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting).\u2014The will of the testator, Thomas Meagher, commences as follows:\u2014\nFor the purpose of carrying out the trusts contained in this my will I give, devise and bequeath all the estate real and personal of which I may die seized or possessed or to which I may be entitled at the time of my decease unto my daughters Mary Ann Meagher and Margaret Ellen Meagher upon trust as follows.\nThere follows an enumeration of the trusts so declared, of which the fifth is as follows:\u2014\nTo hold all my property in lots eight and nine in the third concession from the bay in the Township of York, together with all stock, crops, furniture and other goods and chattels and personal property thereon for my said daughters Mary Ann Meagher and Margaret Ellen Meagher for themselves and to make such disposition thereof from time to time among my children or otherwise as my said daughters decide to make, they my said daughters in the meantime to have all the rents and profits therefrom.\nThe dispute in the action has been narrowed down to the single question of the effect of the fifth trust declared by the testator\u2019s will. I do not think this question presents any great difficulty; such as it does, arises from the fact that the trust is not set forth in regular and settled terms the meaning of which has become well established. Where these are departed from, there is always a likelihood that some opening will be left for a doubt as to the construction to be put upon the language employed; a vast amount of ingenuity has been shewn in the suggestion of possible meanings in the present instance.\nI cannot doubt that the intention of the testator was to place the disposal of the property in question among his children, both as to shares and time, at the discretion of his daughters, Mary Ann Meagher and Margaret Ellen Meagher. It has to be considered how far he has succeeded in carrying out his intention, because, though we may look to the intention to decide the meaning of any ambiguous phrase, we cannot give an effect to the words used which their meaning will plainly not bear. In my opinion, however, full effect can be given in this case to the intention of the testator without adding to or departing from the exact words used.\nI do not understand that any life interest can be taken by the daughters, because there is given to them a power to dispose of the whole property at any time, and it is only in the meantime that they are to receive the rents and profits. By making no appointment, they might, indeed, continue this state of things during their lives, but I do not think this makes any difference; it is only accidental that the power of disposition and the right to receive the rents and profits are in the same hands; if the power of appointment had been given to another child, he could by disposing of the whole property have put an end at any time to the enjoyment by the sisters of the rents and profits.\nThe most important question is, who are the persons in whose favour the power of disposition may be exercised, and it seems to have been thought that the words \u201cor otherwise\u201d following the power \u201cto make such disposition among my children\u201d must be construed to give the daughters a general power of disposition to any one they please. I do not think this is the meaning to be placed on the words \u201cor otherwise.\u201d I think they are to be read with reference to the word \u201camong\u201d in the power of disposition among the children. It is, I think, only a way of expressing a very common trust which in proper legal phraseology would be framed as a power to appoint the trust property to such one or more of the testator\u2019s children in such shares and proportions and at such time or times as the donee of the power might think fit. There is nothing either in the particular trust or in the general scope of the will to warrant the suggestion that the testator intended to give power to appoint strangers or any other than his own children.\nThe power of disposition can only be exercised by the two daughters, Mary Ann Meagher and Margaret Ellen Meagher, and on the death of either of them before making any disposition of the property it will fall into the residuary estate.\nI am not overlooking the words \u201cfor themselves\u201d following the names of the testator\u2019s daughters, Mary Ann Meagher and Margaret Ellen Meagher, which may be thought to be against the construction which I have placed upon the trust. Apart, however, from the fact that they have no technical meaning, they seem, if not senseless, at any rate inapt to express any possible meaning which the testator could have intended. If they refer to the beneficial interest which these ladies take, it can only be such interest as they have under the trust. I am, however, disposed to think that there is another explanation. It is apparent on the face of the will that it was drafted either by a lawyer who was not a very competent draftsman or by someone who had considerable knowledge of legal forms. I think it may be that the insertion of the words \u201cfor themselves\u201d is due to some confused and mistaken idea of proper and apt legal forms. These are perhaps useless speculations and, looking to the intentions of the testator as they are to be gathered from the whole will including the particular devise and bequest, I should have no hesitation in saying that if the words \u201cfor themselves\u201d were repugnant to the construction which I have placed upon the trust, they ought to be disregarded.\nThe effect of the trust construed in accordance with the views above expressed will therefore be: Devise and bequest of all testator\u2019s real and personal estate to trustees; as to the property in the fifth enumeration mentioned\u2014To hold the same upon trust, to make such disposition thereof to or for such one or more of his children in such shares and proportions and in such manner as his daughters, Mary Ann Meagher and Margaret Ellen Meagher, may from time to time direct or appoint, and in the meantime and until any such disposition shall have been made and so far as the same shall not extend, to permit his said daughters, Mary Ann Meagher and Margaret Ellen Meagher, to receive the rents and profits thereof for their own use and benefit and from and after the death of either of them, the said Mary Ann Meagher and Margaret Ellen Meagher, and in default of any such direction or appointment or so far as the same shall not extend, upon the like trusts as are in the will declared concerning the residuary estate.\nI think by following these indications there will be no difficulty in settling the judgment varying the judg- ment of the Appellate Division. If necessary, the matter can be spoken to in chambers.\nThe appeal must be allowed and under ordinary circumstances the costs should come out of the estate, but as it appears that all available assets have been distributed and the action is mainly at any rate concerned with the trust declared in the fifth enumeration in the will, I think the costs of all parties may fairly be paid out of the particular trust property.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014This will seems to have trust written all over it except one ambiguous bit contained in clause 5. Its first clause was evidently intended to be all comprehensive and determine the general scope and purpose of the instrument. That and clause No. 5 are as follows:\u2014\n1. For the purpose of carrying out the trusts contained in this my will I give, devise and bequeath all the estate real and personal of which I may die seized or possessed or to which I may be entitled at the time of my decease unto my daughters Mary Ann Meagher and Margaret Ellen Meagher upon trust as follows:\u2014\n* * *\n5. To hold all my property in lots eight and nine in the third concession from the bay, in the Township of York, together with all stock, crops, furniture and other goods and chattels and personal property thereon for my said daughters Mary Ann Meagher and Margaret Ellen Meagher for themselves and to make such disposition thereof from time to time among my children or otherwise as my said daughters decide to make, they my said daughters in the meantime to have all the rents and profits therefrom.\nOne thing quite clear is that everything was given these daughters for the purpose of carrying out the trusts contained in the will.\nLet us take and apply the following extract from Lewin on Trusts, (12 ed.) ch. IX., p. 169, sec. 1, par. 16:\u2014\n16. Next, a trust results, by operation of law, where the intention not to benefit the grantee, devisee or legatee is expressed upon the instrument itself, as if the conveyance, devise or bequest be to a person \u201cupon trust\u201d and no trust declared, or the bequest be to a person named as executor \u201cto enable him to carry into effect the trusts of the will\u201d and no trust is declared, or the grant, devise or bequest be upon certain trusts that are too vague to be executed, or upon trusts to be thereafter declared and no declaration is ever made, or upon trusts that are void for unlawfulness, or that fail by lapse, etc.; for in these and the like cases the trustee can have no pretence for claiming the beneficial ownership, when, by the express language of the instrument, the whole property has been impressed with a trust.\nWe may assume this to be an accurate presentation of the law. For my present purpose I see no reason to labour with the manifold fine distinctions existent behind this expression thereof.\nThese authorities, cited in foot-notes, at pages 169 and 170, (Lewin on Trusts,) in support of the text I have quoted, shew that the absence of a declaration of trust would not enable such a devisee or legatee to claim the property.\nIs it not therefore quite clear that the first clause of this will has impressed upon the bequests and devises comprised therein a trust which would result respectively to the heirs at law or personal representative of the testator unless so far as relieved therefrom by later clear and unmistakable language? No one will attempt to deny that such later language, so far as clearly intelligible, must govern.\nThis clause 5 contains all that can be invoked to aid the daughters so bound by the obligation of a trust. How can it? It is not necessary to enter upon the profitless discussion of what might have been the exact nature of the title taken by the daughters had the latter part of clause 5 been obliterated, further than to say that even in such a case it might be fairly arguable they took no more than an estate for life under the circumstances in which they had been placed by the rest of the will.\nAssuming it possible to maintain in such a case that they would have taken thereby an estate in fee simple in the land, and a corresponding absolute property in the personalty, how can we say that the following language:\u2014\nand to make such disposition thereof from time to time among my children or otherwise as my said daughters decide to make they my said daughters in the meantime to have all the rents and profits therefrom,\nmust be discarded and is of no effect?\nIt seems, at least impliedly, to rebut any construction of what had preceded it, as ever having been intended by the testator to transfer absolutely all title or interest he had therein.\nIt removes all possibility of holding, properly, that the daughters were intended to have taken all freed from any trust. It leaves them nothing but a life estate, carved out of what they got, freed by virtue of the express terms, including the nominative fashion of doing it, from the trust which otherwise would have bound them.\nBut how does that help us to find a general power or free the additional power over the estate given by these lines from the implication of being impressed with a trust? That additional power is not inconsistent with the trust expressed in the first clause, but quite consistent therewith and what was intended thereby to be defined later.\nEither the language creates a power or it does not.\nIf by reason of and through inaccuracy of expression it fails to convey any meaning, save that I have just adverted to, of making clear it was only a life estate that was intended to be given these daughters, then there has been no trust declared, and the absence of either a declared trust or devise or bequest, in clear and unmistakable terms freeing the same from the trust impressed on it from the beginning, leaves this property to the heirs at law and personal representatives subject to the life estate therein of the daughters or survivor of them.\nAnd if the language used can be construed as giving a power, that is likewise impressed with a trust unless it can clearly be interpreted as excluding it.\nThe only thing in this power which lends a possibility of such exclusion is the use of the phrase \u201cor otherwise.\u201d\nWhen I find that used as the foundation for a process of reasoning which ends by concluding that the donees of the power are but the probable objects of its execution, I hesitate to attribute such intention to the testator, who certainly could have accomplished that result, if so intended, by using direct and simple language.\nThe phrase \u201cor otherwise\u201d may mean so much or so little that its slovenly use, so evident here, tempts me to think it would be more in accord with the scope and purpose of the whole will, and the evidence it furnishes of the testator\u2019s intention, to read it as having relation to the time when the power was to be used.\nIt seems to me this is one of those cases where the strictly grammatical construction does not express what the writer intended.\nIt is more in harmony with all else to be looked at and considered to read the phrase \u201cor otherwise\u201d as related to the question of time. Doing so would give a clear and operative effect to the whole paragraph, instead of rendering it futile.\nIt might obviously be expedient in the interest of those concerned to execute the trust by appointing part of the property at one time, and other parts at other times, as circumstances developed, or if occasion called for it to await a time when a final distribution might be made.\nAgain, if the power never could be prudently executed in its entirety, the result would be to let the children and (or) their descendants acquire the property by the direction of the court or possibly without such direction.\nOne of the difficulties attendant upon its due execution might be the possibility of the donees being excluded.\nThe question thus raised has been dealt with in argument in a recent case of Tharp v. Tharp[8], where the cases are collected.\nI do not intend herein following the inquiry thus suggested, and only mention it for the consideration of those concerned.\nI conclude for the foregoing reasons that the appeal should be allowed and the judgment below varied by striking out the words\nand are also entitled to a general power to appoint the corpus of the said real and personal property either to themselves, the said Mary Ann Meagher and Margaret Ellen Meagher, or to any other person as they may think fit, and doth adjudge the same accordingly,\nand substituting the words\nand have as trustees a power of appointment over said property in favour of the children of the testator to be executed from time to time or otherwise as prudent persons acquainted with the circumstances and conduct of the said children respectively should feel just.\nIt seems to me such was the desire of the testator.\nIt is impossible for us, without the slightest information as to the ages and conditions in life of these children or any of the surrounding circumstances which led the testator to make such a peculiar provision, to say more. It is possible an equal distribution was not intended. It is possible that the testator expected the distribution to depend upon the conduct of the children, and undeserving ones to feel that the trustees had a power of discrimination. I pass no opinion on such suggestions. They may be, even if one knew, a great deal more than presented of no value.\nAt present all that seems to me quite clear is that the impress of a trust is stamped on the power for whatever it is worth. If too vague to be effective as probably intended, the trust will result to the benefit of the heirs.\nAs to the costs, I should leave each party to pay their own costs in the Appellate Division and in this court.\nDUFF J.\u2014The appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLJN J.\u2014I know of no rule of equity which prevents a devisee of property upon trust from taking out of it a benefit which it was the intention of the testator that he should have. Dawson v. Clark[9]; Hughes v. Evans[10]. No doubt the intention to benefit the trustee personally must clearly appear. Such an intention, in my opinion, is explicitly stated in the fifth paragraph of the will here in question in favour of the testator\u2019s two daughters, in regard to the property therein dealt with, and no contrary intention anywhere appears. The concluding words of the fifth clause,\nthey my said daughters in the meantime to have all the rents and profits therefrom\nadmittedly give them a beneficial life interest in the property in question. I agree that they also preclude the construction in favour of their having an unrestricted fee simple, which was the view taken by the learned trial judge. The earlier words,\nfor my said daughters Mary Ann Meagher and Margaret Ellen Meagher for themselves,\nunmistakably indicate that this particular property, which the testator had included in the general devise to them in trust of his entire estate, was nevertheless to be held by the two daughters, not as trustees, but, as the testator puts it, \u201cfor themselves,\u201d i.e., for their own benefit, having regard to what follows, during life, or until disposed of. The words \u201cfor themselves\u201d I regard as at least equivalent in effect to the words \u201cat his own disposal,\u201d discussed in In re Howell[11], as indicative of the testator\u2019s intention that this property was not to be subject to any obligation of trust. After devising the property to his two daughters nominatim \u201cfor themselves,\u201d the testator proceeds to give them the right\nto make such disposition thereof from time to time among my children or otherwise as my said daughters decide to make,\ni.e., not as trustees, but as individuals with an unfettered power of disposition. I cannot find in these words any indication of an intention to benefit the testator\u2019s children exclusively. The words \u201cor otherwise as my said daughters decide to make\u201d distinctly exclude that idea. Should the power conferred not be exercised, subject to the life interest of the two daughters, the property would pass either under the residuary clause or as upon an intestacy.\nI can find no justification for distorting the language of the testator by transposing the words \u201cor otherwise,\u201d as contended for by counsel for the appellants, and placing them immediately after the phrase \u201cfrom time to time\u201d or for refusing to give them their ordinary signification.\nIn a word, this case is governed by that primary and cardinal rule of interpretation, that the grammatical and ordinary sense of the words is to be adhered to unless absurdity, repugnancy or inconsistency should result\u2014a rule too often disregarded in order to give effect to some technical and artificial rule of construction distinctly subordinate and never meant to be invoked where the language is plain and ordinary and there is neither ambiguity or obscurity in it. A testator\u2019s clearly expressed intention, not unlawful or impossible of performance, must be carried out.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014After a good deal of hesitation, I have come to the conclusion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: McMaster, Montgomery, Fleury & Co.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Coatsworth & Richardson.\n[1] 34 Ont.

Prior to the 30th of September, 1902, the Hudson Bay Company was registered as owner * * * of the portion of their reserve in the City of Edmonton now in question. \"2. On the 30th of September, 1902, a plan of subdivision of a portion of the reserve was registered in the Land Titles Office. A memorandum of the registration was noted upon the outstanding certificate of title and a new certificate of title was issued to the Hudson Bay Company.\n\"3. On the 27th of May, 1905, the Calgary and Edmonton Railway Company caused to be filed in the Land Titles Office for the North Alberta Land Registration District a railway location plan which had been duly sanctioned by the Board of Railway Commissioners under the provisions of the 'Railway Act' on the 3rd of May, 1905.\n\"4. On the 20th of November, 1905, a further plan of subdivision was registered by the Hudson Bay Company. A memorandum of the registration was placed upon the Hudson Bay Company's certificate of title and a new certificate of title was issued.\n\"5. Agreements for sale and transfers were from time to time made by the Hudson Bay Company, according to plans B 2 and B 4, as shewn by the indorsements on certificates of title. The company retained those lots corresponding with the lands shewn as required by the Calgary and Edmonton Railway on plan, exhibit 4.\n\"6. Evidence was given before the Board at its sittings at Edmonton on the 31st of October, 1913, as follows:\u2014\n* * * * *\n\"7. On the 20th of October, 1909, an agreement was made between the City of Edmonton and the Calgary and Edmonton Railway Company. The by-law of the City of Edmonton adopting this agreement was validated and confirmed by the Alberta statutes of 1910, ch. 5. \"8. On the 1st of April, 1912, a transfer was executed by the City of Edmonton pursuant to the agreement, transferring to the Calgary and Edmonton Railway Company the lands described in paragraph 2 of the agreement. This transfer was delivered by the city to the railway company and on the 5th of August, 1912, was returned by the railway company's solicitor to the city solicitor for correction owing to objections taken by the surveyor of the Land Titles Office to the accuracy of the description of the land. Since then the railway company has repeatedly requested its return but this has not been done as, in the opinion of the\" registrar, a portion of the lane adjoining in the rear of the lots abutting on Jasper Avenue between 9th and 10th streets has not yet been dedicated by the Hudson Bay Company and negotiations for the purpose of removing this difficulty are proceeding.\n\"9. Transfers have been made by the Hudson Bay Company and others to the Calgary and Edmonton Railway Company of those of the lots according to plan B 4, required by the latter company for railway purposes, and the latter company has now become the registered owner of the lands shewn upon the location plans as required, except such parts of the said lands as are shewn as streets and lanes on plan B 4, and which are described in the transfer. The transfer from the Hudson Bay Company to the Calgary and Edmonton Railway Company was made and accepted on the terms set out in the letters from Curie. & Bond, solicitors for the Calgary and Edmonton Railway Company to the Commissioner of the Hudson Bay Company and the reply thereto.\n\"10. Except as stated in the foregoing paragraphs neither party to the application before the Board of Railway Commissioners had acquired any rights in respect of the land in question.\n\"12. The formal order made by the Board on the application was as follows:\n\"Upon the hearing of the application at the sittings of the Board held at the City of Edmonton, in the Province of Alberta, on Friday, the 31st of October, 1913, in presence of counsel for the said city, the Calgary and Edmonton Railway Company, and the Canadian Pacific Railway Company; and what was alleged by counsel aforesaid:\u2014Counsel for the said municipality submitting that it was necessary, in the first instance, to determine whether or not the municipality has, as a matter of title, the right to open the said highway and was the owner of the land required for the said highway so as to make the said highway senior to the railway;\n\"The Board finds and adjudges that the title of the railway company is sufficient and effective as against the municipality, and that should the said highway be opened, such opening would be subject to the seniority of the railway company's title and construction.\n\"(Sgd.) H. L. Drayton,\n\"Chief Commissioner,\n\"Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada.\n\"13. The questions which at the request of the Corporation of the City of Edmonton are stated by the Board and submitted for determination by the Supreme Court of Canada are:\u2014\n\"(1) Whether as a matter of law the filing of the location plan by the railway company in the appropriate Land Titles Office (said plan having been duly approved by the Board under the provisions of the Act and carried into effect by the railway company), is sufficient and effective to establish the railway company's seniority to the municipality at points where highways were not dedicated by plan or otherwise or actually used, constructed or accepted by the municipality at the time the location plan was so filed?\"\n\"(2) If as a matter of law the municipality had the right as against the railway company to maintain highways at the points in question, was such right discharged by the statute of the Province of Alberta, 10 Edw. VII., ch. 5, sec. 1, and the by-law and agreement thereby validated and confirmed?\"\nO. M. Biggar K.C. for the appellant.\nW. N. Tilley K.C. for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014My answer to the first question is in the affirmative and it will, therefore, be unnecessary to answer the second.\nThe question for determination and the circumstances under which this matter was brought before the Railway Board and referred here are fully explained in the notes of my brother Anglin.\nOnce the location of the railway was officially approved of by the Board and the plan filed with the registrar the right of the railway company to take the land, subject to the payment of compensation, was absolute. By the deposit of the plan the Hudson Bay Company was divested of the power to dispose of its property within the limits of the right-of-way: \"the land was put extra commercium.\" The deposit of the approved plan with the registrar fastened a servitude upon the land taken and gave the company a statutory right to acquire a complete title to it for railway purposes. The railway company would not be trespassing if it entered upon the land even before its expropriation. Vide Re Ruttan and Dreifus and Canadian Northern Railway Company[1], at p. 571. Compare sections 178, 180 of the \"Railway Act.\"\nIt followed necessarily that the filing of the location plan by the railway company with the registrar was sufficient and effective to establish the railway company's seniority to the municipality at points where the highways were not dedicated by plans or otherwise or actually used, constructed or accepted by the municipality at the time the location plan was filed. Vide Williamsport Railroad Co. v. Philadelphia Railroad Co.[2].\nDavies J.\u2014I answer the first question referred in the affirmative, which dispenses with an answer being given to the second question.\nIdington J.\u2014I would answer the first question herein submitted in the affirmative. That question being so answered, the second question does not seem to call for any answer.\nAnglin J.\u2014The question for determination in this case is whether after a railway company had deposited in the proper registry office its location plan, profile and book of reference under sections 122-124 of the \"Railway Act\" 1903 (now secs. 158-160 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1906, ch. 37), the owner of the property across which the railway, according to the plan, etc., so deposited, is carried, can by filing a subdivision plan thereof before notice has been served under section 154 of the Act of 1903 (now sec. 193), oblige the railway company to recognize the existence as highways of streets shewn upon such plan of subdivision as carried across the located right-of-way of the railway.\nThe location plan, etc., duly approved, were deposited in May, 1905, and notice thereof was duly given under section 152 (now sec. 191). The plan of subdivision was filed in November, 1905. The railway company took actual possession of the right-of-way and constructed its railway upon the portion of it in question some time before the enactment of 8 and 9 Edw. VII., ch. 32, sec. 3. It does not appear when notice under section 154 (now sec. 193), was given.\nSection 153 of the \"Railway Act\" of 1903 (now sec. 192, R.S.C. 1906, ch. 37), was in these terms:\nThe deposit of a plan, profile and book of reference, and the notice of such deposit, shall be deemed a general notice to all parties of the lands which will be required for the railway and works; and the date of such deposit shall be the date with reference to which such compensation or damages shall be ascertained.\nIt was, in my opinion, not within the power of the landowner, after the deposit of the location plan, etc., in anywise to affect the land thereby designated as that which the company intended to acquire for its right-of-way so as to interfere with the right of expropriation or to render its exercise more burdensome or less advantageous to the company.\nThe agreement of 1909 made between the City of Edmonton and the railway company in my opinion did not affect their respective rights in regard to the question before us. While unable, in view of the express reservation in it of the city's right to set up the contention that Athabasca and Peace Avenues extend as public highways across the railway right-of-way, to concur in the view expressed by the learned Chief Commissioner that the agreement of 1909\nextinguished any right the public might have of using the continuation of Peace and Athabasca Avenues across the right-of-way of the railway company,\nI am on the other hand of the opinion that nothing in that agreement involves any recognition by the company of these two streets as highways crossing its right-of-way, or interferes with its maintaining whatever rights it had acquired by the deposit of its approved location plan, etc.\nI would, for these reasons, answer the first question submitted by the Board of Railway Commissioners in the affirmative\u2014a conclusion which renders an answer to the second question unnecessary.\nBrodeur J.\u2014The Board of Railway Commissioners has referred the following questions for the consideration of this court:\u2014\n1. Whether as a matter of law the filing of the location plan by the railway company in the appropriate Land Titles Office (said plan having been duly approved by the Board under the provisions of the Act and carried into effect by the railway company), is sufficient and effective to establish the railway company's seniority to the municipality at points where highways were not dedicated by plan or otherwise, or actually used, constructed or accepted by the municipality at the time the location plan was so filed ?\n2. If as a matter of law the municipality had the right as against the railway company to maintain highways at the points in question was such right discharged by the statute of the Province of Alberta, 10 Edw. VII., ch. 5, sec. 1, and the by-law and agreement thereby validated and confirmed?\nIn 1905 the respondent company registered a location plan under the provisions of section 160 of the \"Railway Act.\" It appears that the railway company without having paid a compensation to the landowners started to construct its railway. It is not very clear in the evidence whether this possession of the land has been taken with the permission of the owner; but it is to be supposed, however, that the company was not considered as a trespasser, since no injunction has been taken to prevent it.\nSome months after the deposit of the plans with the registrar, the land owner filed with the registrar a subdivision plan of the property in question on which the street Athabasca Avenue was mentioned. There is no formal evidence as to the date at which this street was dedicated to or accepted by the municipality appellant; but it is pretty evident that the railway was constructed before the street was established as a public work by by-law or was assumed for public use by the City of Edmonton (Ordinances N.W.T. 1904, ch; 19, sec. 6 of Title XXX.).,\nThe situation might be different if before the construction of the railway the municipality had constructed its highway. I would be inclined to think that the highway would be considered then as having the seniority, though the location plan of the railway would have been previously deposited.\nWe could then apply the principle enunciated by the Board of Railway Commissioners in the case of the Canadian Northern Railway Co. and the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. and known as the Kaiser Crossing \u00c7ase[3], in which Mr. Mabee, the then chairman of the Board, said;\nI do not think that the mere approval of the plans filed with it necessarily gives seniority to the plans first approved. * * * It seems to me that the railway that is in actual occupation with an existing work upon the ground with the ownership of the fee at the point of crossing has much stronger claims to seniority than the railway which has merely obtained a prior sanction of its plans. That decision was followed by the Board in another case of the Canadian Northern Railway Co. v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[4], that held:\nThat construction and not approval of location gave priority.\nAssuming then that the construction of the railway in the present case has preceded the construction of the highway, I have no hesitation in answering in the affirmative the first question.\nIn view of that answer to the first question, it is not necessary to deal with the second question.\nQuestion submitted answered accordingly.\nSolicitor for the appellant; J.

His proper compensation is the amount which a prudent man in the position of the owner would be willing to pay. Brodeur J. dissenting. Judgment appealed against (34 Ont. L.R. 328) varied.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1] affirming with a slight variation of the award of the arbitrators appointed to determine the compensation to respondents for their property expropriated.\nThe respondents carried on an ice business in Brantford and the business premises were expropriated for purposes of appellants\u2019 railway. The evidence produced before the arbitrators appointed to determine their compensation showed that the premises were specially adapted for their business and the arbitrators awarded for such special adaptability the sum of $20,000 representing the annual saving of expense over the cost of doing business in another place capitalized for ten years. This was added to the $29,000 allowed as the market value of the property. The Appellate Division upheld the award save as to $800 allowed for sawdust which was struck off.\nTilley K.C. and Brewster K.C., for the appellants.\nCowan K.C. for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014Any question of principle involved in this case is, I think, covered by the authority of the decision of the Judicial Committee in Pastoral Finance Association v. The Minister[2].\nThe arbitrators here have found the market value of the property and then added to the amount the special value of the land to the respondents. To this special value the respondents were undoubtedly entitled whatever exception may be taken to the way in which it was arrived at. In the case above referred to the Judicial Committee say:\u2014.\nThe substantial ground on which the majority of the court based their decision was that the appellants were not entitled to anything beyond the market value of the land * * * * Their Lordships have no hesitation in deciding that, the principle underlying this decision is erroneous. The appellants were clearly entitled to receive compensation based on the value of the land to them.\nThe Appellate Division, following this ruling, has held that the respondents were entitled to the special value which the arbitrators have allowed. The court indeed takes exception to the method adopted for arriving at the proper compensation by first taking the market value of the property and then ascertaining and adding the special value to the respondents. The court considers, and I think rightly, that the preferable method would have been to ascertain simply the value of the property to the respondents and base upon this the compensation to which they were entitled. The court, however, finds and again, I think, rightly, that there has been no error in principle which can affect the amount of the compensation awarded. With the amount allowed the court professes itself satisfied and declines to vary it.\nThe only question, therefore, for this court to determine is, in my opinion, the adequacy of the amount of the compensation awarded.\nAlthough I think the sum of $29,000 at which the jury have estimated the market value of the property is a very liberal allowance, I am not disposed to interfere with this, holding as I do, that unless the award of arbitrators is clearly excessive, it should not be disturbed on an appeal to the courts. Notwithstanding, however, this disposition to interfere as little as possible with the award of arbitrators on a simple question of amount, I cannot accept the finding, with regard to the special value of the property to the respondents. The sum of $20,000 cannot, I think, be justified by anything in the evidence pointing to such loss by the respondents as would entitle them to compensation on this scale.\nUnder the circumstances, it is necessary to adhere to the method of valuation which the arbitrators have adopted and to deal separately with the loss which the respondents have sustained by reason of the special value of the property to them.\nUpon reading the evidence and giving the matter the most careful consideration, the conclusion that I have arrived at is, that if to the market value found by the arbitrators at $29,000 there is added $4,000 for the so-called special value, the respondents will have received full and ample compensation for the loss which they have sustained by the taking from them of their property.\nThe appeal must be allowed to the extent of reducing the total award to the sum of $33,000. The appeal of the respondents is dismissed.\nDAVIES J.\u2014This appeal is from the judgment of the First Appellate Division of Ontario confirming an award made by arbitrators appointed to value the compensation payable to the respondents for two pieces of property expropriated by the railway company in the City of Brantford on which the respondents carried on an ice business, less the sum of $800 for sawdust which was disallowed.\nThere was a cross-appeal by the respondents to restore this $800; but I may as well dispose of this cross-appeal by saying that I am quite in accord with the Appellate Division in disallowing this item.\nAs to the award, the business premises consisted of two distinct parcels of land with buildings upon them, one called the Water Street lands and the other the Greenwich Street lands. As to the former, the arbitrators valued the compensation payable for the lands at $4,620 and the buildings at $3,500, and as to the latter, the lands at $10,560 and the buildings at $8,400. The values placed upon the machinery and the sawdust between the walls are not in dispute:\nThe total value awarded for the lands, buildings, sawdust and machinery amounted to $29,000 and in their written reasons the arbitrators explained that\nthe values put upon these lands and buildings is their intrinsic value or real value as taken for any purpose, not necessarily the ice business, but we found also that these lands were especially adapted for the ice business, reducing the handling and storing of ice to a minimum of expense and making it much less expensive than it can be done for at the premises to which the claimants propose removing or indeed in any other premises in the City of that were mentioned or pointed out to us.\nThe arbitrators then proceed to add to the \u201cintrinsic or real value\u201d of the lands and buildings as determined by them the sum of $20,000 for the reason, as explained by them, of \u201cspecial adaptability\u201d of the lands for the business of the ice company, thus increasing their award to $49,000. Their language in the award is:\u2014\nThen in addition also for the extra cost of harvesting ice in any other place in the City of Brantford or what may be termed \u201cSpecial Adaptability\u201d interest in the lands expropriated by the Railway Company. * * *\nWith respect to this item, the main one is dispute, the Appellate Division says:\u2014\nThe amount of $20,000 seems large, having regard to the figures awarded for the land and buildings in this case. But there seems to be no basis on which it can fairly be reduced, if, as I think was intended, it represents the special value of the land expropriated and damages for disturbance to business.\nI am extremely reluctant to set aside or alter the award of arbitrators who have had the advantages of seeing and hearing the witnesses and visiting the property, and with respect to the $29,000 awarded, though I agree it is very large and, specially with respect to the amount awarded for the Water Street buildings, which had been condemned by the city inspector as dilapidated and dangerous, indefensibly large, yet I am not, in view of the judgment of the Appellate Division, disposed to interfere with it holding that it includes all damages for compulsory purchase.\nWith respect to the additional amount of $20,000 added under the head of \u201cspecial adaptability,\u201d I am of opinion that the arbitrators proceeded upon a wrong principle. They first found on conflicting evidence that the extra expense of harvesting and selling the ice at the proposed new location would be $2,000 yearly and they proceed to allow this amount for ten years in addition to the intrinsic value of the property taken. There is no justification in my judgment for such an arbitrary assessment.\nThe true principle on which they should have proceeded is that laid down by the Judicial Committee in the Pastoral Finance Association v. The Minister[3], namely, that this special suitability of the lands expropriated for the carrying on of an ice business and the additional profits which the owners will derive from so carrying it on, are proper elements in assessing the compensation, but the owner is not entitled to have the capitalized value of those savings and profits added to the market value of the lands.\nTheir Lordships say at page 1088 of the report of the above case:\u2014\nThat which the appellants were entitled to receive was compensation not for the business profits or savings which they expected to make from the use of the land, but for the value of the land to them. No doubt the suitability of the land for the purpose of their special business affected the value of the land to them, and the prospective savings and. additional profits which it could be shewn would probably attend the use of the land in their business furnished material for estimating what was the real value of the land to them. But that is a very different thing from saying that they were entitled to have the capitalized value of these savings and additional profits added to the market value of the land in estimating their compensation. They were only entitled to have them taken into consideration so far as they might fairly be said to increase the value of the land. Probably the most practical form in which the matter can be put is that they were entitled to that which a prudent man in their position would have been willing to give for the land sooner than fail to obtain it. Now it is evident that no man would pay for land in addition to its market value the capitalized value of the savings and additional profits which he would hope to make by the use of it. He would, no doubt, reckon out those savings and additional profits as indicating the elements of value of the land to him, and they would guide him in arriving at the price which he would be willing to pay for the land, but certainly if he were a business man that price would not be calculated by adding the capitalized savings and additional profits to the market value.\nThis statement of the law shews clearly that in arbitrarily adding ten times the amount of their estimate of the extra yearly cost of harvesting and selling their ice product, the arbitrators proceeded upon a wrong principle and one which, if indorsed by the courts, would, in many cases (I think in this case), be productive of great wrong.\nAfter giving the facts of the case and the arguments at bar and in the respective factums every consideration and giving the judgment which, in my opinion, the Appellate Court should have given, I have reached the conclusion that a prudent man in their position might have been willing to give for the lands taken a sum certainly not greater than $5,000 for these special advantages and adaptability to the ice business in addition to their intrinsic value as found by the arbitrators. In this view my brother Anglin concurs but we agree to reduce that $5,000 down to $4,000 in order that there may be a majority judgment reached. The judgment appealed from accordingly will be reduced to $33,000.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014This appeal arises out of the expropriation by appellant under the Railway Act of lands in Brantford used by the respondents for carrying on an ice business.\nThe arbitrators\u2019 award of compensation amounted to a total of $49,000 made up as follows:\u2014 Machinery (valued by consent)\n$675.00\nWater Street lands\n4,620.00\nWater Street buildings\n3,500.00\nGreenwich Street lands\n10,560.00\nGreenwich Street buildings\n8,400.00\nSawdust in walls\n445.00\nSawdust in ice house for covering ice\n800.00\nTotal of above\n$29,000.00\nThen in addition also for the extra cost of harvesting ice in any other place in the City of Brantford or what may be termed \u201cSpecial Adaptability\u201d interest in the lands expropriated by the Railway Company\n20,000.00\nMaking a grand total of\n49,000.00\nThe Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario struck out the $800 item for sawdust used for covering in the ice house, thus leaving $28,200.00 for lands and buildings.\nHow such an item of purely personal property crept into such an award puzzles me, yet respondents ask its restoration. The remaining items of the original $29,000 are claimed to be high but admittedly cannot be contested here with much hope of success in face of the evidence and no legal principle violated in acting thereon.\nThe additional item of $20,000 does not seem to be justifiable on any legal principle put forward to support it when dependent only upon such evidence as relied upon.\nThe expression of the arbitrators of what the item stands for is rather confusing and, I most respectfully submit, seems the result of the confusion of thought which lies at the root of the error into which the arbitrators fell. And their later deliveries of divergent reasons supporting their respective views, apparently after an appeal was in sight, is an unsatisfactory method of doing so, for the reasons under such circumstances do not carry the same weight as if they had been delivered with the award.\nThe lands are to be estimated in such cases as in question herein upon the basis of their market value. And it is what they are worth to the owner that is to be considered.\nIn fixing the market value at the figure they did I have to assume the arbitrators proceeded on their appreciation of the evidence before them. We are not seriously asked to change that. But in that evidence so far as counsel in argument or in factum has directed our consideration, there was nothing presented to shew that there was any market price for ice house sites as distinguished from their values for anything else. Yet it is that market price of any land possessing special adaptability for anything that has to be determined if we are in principle to follow the latest authority reiterating the rule in the case of Cedars Rapids Manufacturing and Power Co. v. Lacoste[4], at p. 579.\nThe direct evidence which ought to be required to fix the market value in that regard has not been produced. In the indirect way, of entering into a long and elaborate investigation of the comparative cost of operating with this plant where it is, as compared with a plant assumed to be placed some place else, there is alleged to exist the basis of a calculation of value to be added to the market price.\nNot a title of evidence is referred to shewing that any sane man of business would think of investing $48,200 for land and buildings of the kind in question devoted to an ice business selling four thousand tons of ice per season. The proposition seems to me to sound rather hollow. And without going so far as to hold, as matter of law, that you cannot prove value and even market value by an involved process like unto that tried but uncompleted here, I may say the process has (if it ever can be made operative and serviceable), failed in this case because of that reasonable approach to completion which would make it worth anything being entirely wanting.\nWould any one looking ahead to the enlightenment of the public on the subject of health and the gradual enforcement of the results thereof, through boards of health and otherwise, think of purifying the Grand River sewage for the express purpose of an ice business? Would he shew his faith in the business sense of doing so by paying $20,000 for the privilege when and where pure water is to be found and ice produced therefrom at perhaps less expense in any convenient spot? And all for the sake of a few incidental and temporary advantages of handling the product at a trifling less expense. And in Brantford, we are asked to believe these incidental advantages will extend over a period of ten or twenty years. The economic and social forces are against the realization of such imaginary contingencies.\nThere is only one other ice business in the city and that is supplied by pure water and involves a haulage of a mile and a half more than respondents either had to or has now to face in way of competition.\nThe proof that this plant had been made profitable and had been placed on a permanently profitable basis that would justify an investment of $48,200, has fallen short. Indeed so far as I can see the evidence is the other way.\nThe appellant\u2019s factum presents a statement of counsel\u2019s estimate of the results so far as known which I do not adopt in its entirety. But in the main it ought to have been met and displaced if untrustworthy.\nThe only reason I imagine for respondents\u2019 able counsel failing therein is that the main facts were against him attempting it.\nMoreover, though respondents\u2019 counsel properly enough put forward the interest on $29,000 as an item of expense in order to test whether or not there was such a profit in the business as to render it likely an owner getting that sum for his business stand could rightly complain, yet it is to be observed that the problem facing us is whether or not any one would think of paying $48,200 for such a business stand and to test that we must take interest on the latter sum as a test of what strain the proposition to be maintained by respondents will stand.\nUnless there was either a highly profitable or at least a clearly substantial, profitable and permanently established business existent on the premises, this mode of proof of market value thereof is worthless.\nAll the elaborate calculations of a possible difference in cost of handling are of no consequence if the thing itself has failed to produce to the owner such a productive investment that reasonable men must say he would not and should not be asked to part with such a property for its ordinary market value.\nIf he expects others, even a railway company, to pay him for depriving him of a business stand something beyond ordinary market value, he must be ready and willing to demonstrate the fact just as fully as possible and allow the fullest possible investigation of the basis of such a proposition.\nThere was neither cash book nor ledger kept in the business and the only possible available and sub- stantial means of testing the matter was an inspection and thorough investigation of the bank book and that was refused.\nThere was, therefore, in short no proof upon which the arbitrators should have allowed any such sum as the item in question, and that part of the award should be stricken out.\nThe ordinary ten per centum allowance for compulsory taking in absence of such proper proof should be allowed instead, amounting to $2,820.\nThis is not a case for referring back, for the respondents had deliberately refused that proper investigation of the lines of proof upon which they rested their claim.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs here but without costs to either party in the court below, and the award amended in the way I have indicated.\nANGLIN J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Davies.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014This is an appeal concerning the compensation which should be awarded to the respondents for the expropriation of lands in the City of Brantford. Those properties were used by the respondents for harvesting and storing ice. They were situated on the Grand River and they were specially adaptable for that business. The current of the river afforded facilities for storing ice which reduced to a minimum the cost of the work.\nThere is not much difficulty with regard to the value put upon the lands and the buildings. The three arbitrators have come to a unanimous conclusion in that respect.\nThere is, however, a difference between them. One of the arbitrators is of opinion that the price which has been awarded for the lands and the buildings would have included also the special adaptability of this property for the ice business.\nThe other two arbitrators, on the other hand, state that $29,000, which is the amount awarded for the lands and buildings, would simply give the intrinsic value of the property for any purpose, not necessarily the ice business; but they find that the lands were specially adapted for the ice business and that it has cost less to the owners for handling and storing their ice than it will cost at the place where they will have to remove their place of business.\nIt appears that the reason for this low degree of expense is that the ice field is some distance above the buildings and that the respondents used to cut the ice in squares on that field. They would cut then a canal through the ice to the storehouse and float the ice down this canal each block being ready for storage.\nThe other arbitrator does not dispute the advantage of the convenience of harvesting ice at that point; but he claims that the railway company had the option either of compensating them for such advantage or of compensating them for the establishment of the business so far as such business was incidental to the land expropriated. He does not dispute the fact that, if the method adopted by the majority of the arbitrators is correct, the value put as to damages incurred would be correct.\nThe railway companies in exercising their right of eminent domain are bound not only to pay the market value of the lands expropriated but also the damages incurred by the owner in connection with the expropriation.\nHere is a man who had, on account of the con- venient site of his business, particular advantages for handling it. Those advantages could not be secured elsewhere and in order to carry out the same business as he was doing before he will have to pay extra costs and incur additional expenditure. He will suffer damages then as a result of that expropriation and it seems to me that the principles of law enunciated above render the railway company liable for those additional costs.\nThe Privy Council in the case of Pastoral Finance Association v. The Minister[5], decided that the special suitability of the land for a business which the owner carries on elsewhere but intends to transfer to that land and the savings and additional profits which he will derive from so doing are elements in assessing the compensation.\nIt seems to me that, applying the principles enunciated in the above decision of the Privy Council, the owners, respondents, are in this case entitled to be compensated for special adaptability of the lands expropriated or for extra cost of harvesting ice in any other place in the locality.\nThe arbitrators have awarded a sum of $20,000 for such compensation and they are all unanimous as to the amount of that compensation if the above principle is right. The amount seems to be very high; but I would not feel disposed to substitute my own judgment as to the value for the judgment of the arbitrators.\nThere has been a cross-appeal by the respondents concerning a sum of $800 which was awarded by the arbitrators for the sawdust which was in the ice house for covering ice. That amount was refused by the Appellate Division and I concur in the views expressed by that court that the owners are not entitled to the same.\nFor these reasons the appeal and the cross-appeal should both be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Brewster & Heyd.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Beatty, Blackstock, Fasken, Cowan & Chadwick.\n[1] 34 Ont.

The trial judge decreed specific performance of the contract by J., and, on appeal, the full court varied the judgment by ordering that there should be a reference for inquiry and report upon T.'s title to the lands in Iowa, and that, upon the filing of such report, either party should be at liberty to apply for such judgment as he might be entitled to (8 Sask. L.R. 387). On the appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada the material questions were whether or not the fact that the lands to be exchanged were situated outside the province precluded the courts of Saskatchewan from decreeing specific performance for want of mutality of relief, and whether or not there was error in making the order of reference, which, in effect, gave the plaintiff a second opportunity of proving his title.\nHeld, Idington J. dissenting, that the courts of Saskatchewan, as courts of equity acting in personam, have jurisdiction to decree specific performance of contracts for the sale of lands situate within the province where the person against whom relief is sought resides within their jurisdiction; that, in the suit instituted by the foreign plaintiff in Saskatchewan, mutuality of relief existed between the parties, and that the discretion of the court appealed from in ordering the reference before the entry of the formal decree ought not to be interfered with on the appeal.\nThe jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Canada to entertain the appeal was questioned by the Chief Justice and Idington J. on the ground that the judgment appealed from was not a \"final judgment.\" Davies J. was of opinion that, as the suit was \"in the nature of a suit or proceeding in equity,\" an appeal lay to the Supreme Court of Canada in virtue of subsec. (c) of sec. 38 of the \"Supreme Court Act,\" R.S.C., 1906, ch. 139. Anglin J. thought that, as a matter of discretion, the court might decline to hear such an appeal. Judgment appealed from (8 Sask. L.R. 387) affirmed, Idington J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan[1], which varied the judgment of Newlands J. at the trial, whereby specific performance was decreed, by directing that there should be a reference for inquiry and report on the plaintiff's title to foreign lands and, on the filing of such report, that either party should be at liberty to apply for such judgment as he might be entitled to.\nThe circumstances of the case are stated in the head-note.\nHaydon for the appellant.\nG. F. Henderson K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I entertain grave doubts whether this appeal ought to be entertained by this court. There is no judgment in the action; the decree directing a reference to the local registrar does not order that on the respondent proving title the appellant is to make a conveyance of his lands in Saskatchewan, but, on the contrary, orders that, on the report being filed, either party is to be at liberty to apply for such judgment as he may be entitled to.\nI am, with much diffidence, of opinion that the appeal must fail on the merits. There seems to me nothing in the first point taken by the appellant that, the respondent not having proved his title at the trial a reference should not have been directed. The plaintiff, in bringing his action for specific performance, was not obliged to prove his title. The rule, as I understand it, is that the defendant is entitled to ask for a reference on the title, which the court will grant as a condition of extending its assistance to the plaintiff.\nAs to the second point, the appellant claims that there was no mutuality of remedy, but that is, I think, unfounded. It would have been open to the appellant to go, for specific performance, to the courts in whose jurisdiction the lands were situate precisely as the respondent has done. The question of mutuality depends upon each of the parties having their remedy, not upon the particular court in which it is to be sought. I think it makes no difference that the lands are in a foreign country rather than in another province of the Dominion. If they had been situate in Ontario, it might have been necessary for the appellant to go to the Ontario courts for a decree for specific performance, but he would none the less have had his remedy equally with the respondent.\nThe present is not in the least like reported cases in which the courts have refused specific performance on the ground of want of mutuality. These all assume that, if the court in which the action is brought cannot give a remedy, the defendant has none. In the case of Flight v. Bolland[2], an infant having brought suit for specific performance, the bill was dismissed because, of course, the defendant could have brought no such suit against the plaintiff, and, therefore, the remedy was not mutual.\nThere might, perhaps, be cases where the courts of the foreign country would not afford relief, though the present is, doubtless, not one of them. It must, however, lie on the party claiming that there is no mutuality in the contract, because he is without remedy to shew that this is so. The respondent went into the foreign country and made his contract for the purchase, by exchange, of lands in that country, and there should certainly be no presumption that he cannot enforce his contract in the same way that the respondent can do in this country.\nDavies J.\u2014This was an appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan varying the judgment of the trial judge, Which judgment had decreed specific performance of an agreement made between the parties for the sale of a piece of land in Saskatchewan from defendant, appellant, to plaintiff, and also directing a reference on other points.\nThe decree of the appellate court now appealed from and under consideration merely directed that there should be a reference as to the plaintiff's title to the piece of land in Iowa which the plaintiff was to convey to the defendant in exchange for the Saskatchewan lands and for a report upon such title, and that, upon such report being filed, either party should be at liberty to apply to the trial judge \"for such judgment as he would be entitled to.\" The appellant's contentions were that the respondent, plaintiff, had failed at the trial to prove his title to the Iowa lands, and that no reference should have been made as directed; and, secondly, that the plaintiff being a non-resident, the court could not enforce the contract as against him, and had, therefore, no jurisdiction.\nAs to the latter point, I agree with the judgment appealed from that, as the decree sought for by the plaintiff is for specific performance of the contract respecting the Saskatchewan lands, the court has jurisdiction to make a decree, and that the reference directed to be made as to the title of the Iowa lands to be exchanged for the Saskatchewan lands is a matter of procedure and practice. The fact of the plaintiff being a non-resident could not, in my opinion, take away the jurisdiction they would otherwise possess; nor could the fact that the consideration for the sale of the Saskatchewan lands to the plaintiff was the conveyance to the defendant of certain lands in Iowa have that effect.\nThe appellate court had jurisdiction to deal with the matter before it, namely, the contractual obligation of the defendant to convey the Saskatchewan lands to the plaintiff, and I approve of the disposition they made of the appeal. It may be argued with much force that, being a matter of procedure and practice and the exercise of a judicial discretion, this court would not interfere with the judgment appealed from on that ground. It must be remembered, however, that this judgment is \"in the nature of a suit or proceeding in equity,\" and that our jurisdiction is governed by sub-section c of section 38. It is not necessary that a judgment under this section, to be appealable, should be a \"final judgment.\"\nIn dismissing the appeal, I desire, in view of the broad language of sub-section c of section 38, to base my judgment upon the ground that the court below had jurisdiction to deal with the appeal before them, and that the disposition they made of the appeal was a proper one under the circumstances.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014These litigants entered into a contract in writing, in the United States, where respondent resided and still resides, whereby the appellant agreed to sell to him a section of land in Saskatchewan at the agreed consideration of $22,800, and, in consideration thereof, the respondent agreed to sell and convey to appellant real estate situate in Iowa same being put in at an agreed consideration of $16,000.\nThe respondent agreed thereby to execute a mortgage to the appellant on the Canadian lands for $6,800.\nIt was well understood by the parties, at the time of the making of the contract, that appellant only owned the half of the section of land he professed to be selling, but he said he had the authority of his brother, who owned the other half of the section, to deal with the whole, as they express it.\nIt turned out that the brother, though assenting in general terms to appellant's desire to sell and dispose of the whole section, never intended to assent to an exchange, and, perhaps, never had heard, till the contract was made, of the exchange proposal now in question, and, when told of it, at once refused to have anything to do with such a transaction.\nThe respondent sued both brothers for specific performance. At the trial the action was dismissed as against the one who had not signed the contract.\nEvidence was given shewing that the north half-section, belonging to the brother thus dismissed, was worth $30 an acre, and the south half, belonging to appellant, which was improved, and had buildings on it, was worth $40 an acre.\nThe price fixed, for the whole section, by the contract, works out about $35.66 per acre for the whole.\nThe respondent, upon failing as against the brother of appellant, offered in court to accept the south half-section belonging to the appellant, and give in exchange the Iowa property.\nThis the learned trial judge assented to and gave judgment accordingly. There was evidence given professing to prove the title of the respondent to the Iowa property. The attorney giving that evidence stated, in doing so, the conclusion which should have been left to the court to draw from legal facts laying the foundation for the court to do so.\nBecause of there being no evidence otherwise enabling the learned trial judge to act upon such a transgression of the rule in such cases, the court below set the judgment aside, and directed evidence to be taken by the registrar as to the title and to report thereon, and that either party should then be at liberty to apply to the learned trial judge for such judgment as he might be entitled to.\nThe appellant contends this was not the judgment the court of appeal should have given, but one dismissing the action on the grounds that the respondent had failed in his proof of title, and that, in any event, the production of such proof and determination thereof involved exactly such questions as would have arisen had the appellant been seeking specific performance of the contract to convey Iowa lands, which the court could not grant under the existent facts.\nIn other words, he says there never existed that mutuality of contract\nwhich might, at the time it was entered into, have been enforced by either of the parties against the other.\nI quote the pith of the first sentence of the chapter on \"want of mutuality in the contract\" in Sir Edward Fry's work on Specific Performance.\nI felt disposed, during the argument, to think the point of view presented by Mr. Justice Elwood possibly maintainable by looking at the land in the foreign country as simply the consideration, and all needed herein was to find if that was ascertainable and ready to be delivered as any other price where specific performance might be ordered. But, upon reflection and an examination of the authorities, it seems to me clear such a proposition is more plausible than sound in law, and is untenable.\nThe contract, as amended by the court, is simply one of exchange of two parcels of land respectively situated in different countries.\nIn one way of looking at the matter, this is a claim by the purchaser to have a contract for the purchase of land in Canada specifically enforced. In the other way of looking at it, this is simply a claim by the vendor to have a contract for the sale of land in the United States specifically enforced by the recovery of the consideration therefor.\nIf we look at the new contract made by the court and to be enforced, the question is reduced to that simple form, if we strip the matter of mere forms and verbiage, and have due regard to that which has become the substance of all that is involved.\nI have been unable to find any case in which exactly the like case to this has been decided. But there are many cases in which the principle has been affirmed that the courts must refuse to entertain any claim as enforceable against the lands in a foreign jurisdiction. Where the party against whom relief is sought, it may be in relation to lands abroad, has been found resident within the jurisdiction of the court, it has exercised jurisdiction in a variety of ways, as illustrated in the case of Penn v. Lord Baltimore[3] and in White and Tudor's Leading Cases, vol. 2, p. 1047, and in 1 Eq. Cas. Abrgd. 133, there are to be found a number of cases cited which must be considered, if one would-be seized of the principle involved.\nThe elaborate judgment of Lord Chancellor Herschell in the case of The British South Africa Company v. The Companhia de Mo\u00e7ambique[4], has a most instructive review of the foundation upon which such a jurisdiction rests, and, at page 626, contains the following concise statement of what I take to be the law:\u2014\nWhilst courts of equity have never claimed to act directly upon lands situate abroad, they have purported to act upon the conscience of persons living there. In Lord Cranstown v. Johnston[5], Sir R. P. Arden, Master of the Rolls, said: \"Archer v. Preston[6], Lord Arglasse v. Muschamp[7], and Lord Kildare v. Eustace[8], clearly shew that, with regard to any contract made, or equity between persons in this country, respecting lands in a foreign country, particularly in the British dominions, this court will hold the same jurisdiction as if they were situate in England.\"\nThe distinction made throughout in all the leading cases is between remedies in personam and in rem.\nApply the principles involved to the facts herein, and we are met by two or three outstanding facts which would seem to render a suit by the appellant against the respondent for specific performance as hopeless as one can conceive.\nThe contract was entered into in the foreign state. The land is there. And the respondent, the vendor of that land, resides there, and, so far as we know, never was in Canada before the proceedings herein, except to inspect this land offered in exchange, and he then had fifteen days to elect whether he should proceed with or abandon the contract. His presence at the trial as a witness could certainly make no safe foundation for applying the rule as laid down in Fry's work or above quotation from Lord Herschell's judgment.\nHow, then, can we find that mutuality the law requires?\nThe case does not fall within any of the numerous exceptions to the rule. Surely there is quite as much want of mutuality as in the case of an infant as exemplified in the case of Flight v. Bolland[9], where specific performance was sought by an infant and refused expressly on the ground that such relief could not be obtained by the defendant against him.\nThere is an article by the late Professor Ames, of Harvard, to be found in a posthumous publication of his Lectures on Legal History, etc., criticizing the statement of the law by Sir Edward Fry in the chapter I have above quoted from, in which he questions the accuracy of the definition which I am for the present accepting. The exigencies of this case do not require me to re-examine Sir Edward Fry's proposition, but, nevertheless, the article is well worth reading and consideration by those who would understand the doctrine of mutuality of contract in question.\nIt is to be observed that the fundamental rule of the game resting on mutuality is, perhaps, obscured by the numerous exceptions and subsidiary rules, yet the former seems firmly established, even if the masters of the law disagree in regard to the form of its expression.\nThere is another point taken against the judgment in the appellant's factum. It is submitted that the cy-pr\u00e8s doctrine invoked in dealing with the agreement and compensation made in the way I have mentioned does not apply to this case. The reason assigned in the factum seems merely a repetition of want of mutuality, but, on examining the evidence, there is, to my mind, a much graver objection. It is this:\u2014The appellant never pretended he owned any but half of the section, and merely pretended he had authority from his brother to deal with his half thereof brought in question.\nWhen a man has, in error, made a contract for sale of more than he has, and the parties he is dealing with know it, or should from the nature of the transaction have known it, the court does not permit of abatement of price by way of compensation to a purchaser, or, in other words, attempt to make a new equitable bargain for the parties.\nSee the cases of Castle v. Wilkinson[10]; Avery v. Griffin[11]; Cahill v. Cahill[12]; Rudd v. Lascelles[13], and the case of Mortlock v. Buller[14], where the principle is stated upon which the court acts.\nI cannot conceive the doctrine of compensation applicable when, as here, the parties knew the appellant had, in fact, no title, and depended on his assurance of authority as an agent.\nIn that case I think all the respondent can claim is the expense he incurred or was put to by reason of the failure of the agent in warranting his authority when he had none, or at least none which would cover the contract entered into.\nI would be disposed to say, in order to end, if possible, this litigation, that if the respondent assents to the abandonment of such claim for damages, the action should be dismissed without costs, otherwise the appeal should be allowed with costs throughout. Since writing the foregoing, my Lord the Chief Justice calls my attention to the case of Montgomery v. Ruppensburg[15], which I cannot follow, especially as, I respectfully submit, the cases relied upon do not touch the principle involved. One of the cases apparently in point goes upon the exceptional case of the contract being unilateral, or, at all events, so as regards the Statute of Frauds. That class of cases and many other exceptions are dealt with both by Sir Edward Fry, affirming the principle I rely upon, and by the late Professor Ames in the work I have referred to above.\nSince writing above, the decision of this court, in St. John Lumber Co. v. Roy[16], renders it doubtful if this case is appealable. My reasons in support of my dissent in that case may suggest grounds for distinguishing. And, if we have jurisdiction, I abide by my reasons herein expressed as above.\nBut if the judgment appealed from should be treated merely as an exercise of discretion, the case of The Union Bank of Halifax v. Dickie[17] would apply.\nAnglin J.\u2014By an agreement in writing, dated the 12th day of December, 1913, the defendant William W. Jones agreed to sell to the plaintiff the whole of section 17, in township 4 and range 3, west of the second meridian, in the Province of Saskatchewan, in consideration of the sum of $22,800, payable, as to $16,000 thereof, by the conveyance to him of certain property in the town of Jefferson, in the State of Iowa, U.S.A., and, as to the balance of $6,800, by the delivery of a mortgage for the said sum, upon terms therein set out, to be made by the plaintiff in favour of the defendant.\nThe plaintiff sues for specific performance of this agreement. At the trial it developed that the defendant, Wm. W. Jones, could not make title to the north half of the section, which was owned by his co-defendant, John R. Jones, who was not a party to the agreement. The action was dismissed as against John R. Jones. Upon the defendant, Wm. W. Jones, objecting that a decree could not be made against him under the agreement sued upon involving payment by him of $3,200, the difference in value between the land owned by him and the Jefferson property, the respondent, through his counsel, offered to take the defendant's half-section in exchange for his Jefferson property without any cash compensation or difference in price. This adjustment must have been agreed to by the defendant if the court should be of opinion that the facts that the plaintiff is a foreigner and that the property which he had agreed to convey in exchange is foreign land did not disentitle him to the relief of specific performance, and if his title to the Jefferson property were sufficiently proved. I say \"must have been agreed to,\" because the learned trial judge, in his reasons for judgment, says:\u2014\nI am of the opinion that the plaintiff is entitled to specific performance under the terms agreed to in court,\nand, in the defendant's appeal to the court en banc from the judgment entered for specific performance, it was not urged that such an agreement had not in fact been made at the trial. The defendant's inability to convey part of the property which he had undertaken to give in exchange cannot avail him as a defence to the plaintiff's action for specific performance of the contract, so far as he can carry it out, on the basis of an even exchange, the plaintiff relinquishing all claim to payment of the difference between the value of the Jefferson property and the half-section of the Saskatchewan land which the defendant is able to convey: Fry on Specific Performance (5th ed.), pp. 599 et seq. Moreover, in view of what occurred at the trial, it is, in my opinion, now too late to urge any such defence.\nThe decree of the learned trial judge declared the right to specific performance, referred a matter of adjustment of insurance to the local registrar, and ordered the defendant to convey his Saskatchewan land upon the plaintiff executing and delivering to him a good and sufficient deed of the Jefferson property.\nOn appeal to the court en banc, as appears from the judgment of Elwood J., only two objections were urged against this judgment. That learned judge says:\u2014\nThe defendant appeals and contends that the plaintiff has not made out a good title to the Iowa property, and also that the court will not decree specific performance because the claim depends on title to land in a foreign country.\nThe appellate court was of the opinion that, although the fact that the land to be conveyed by the plaintiff was situated abroad did not preclude specific performance being decreed, the plaintiff had not proved his title to it. Instead of dismissing the action, however, the court, in the exercise of its discretion, referred it to the local registrar to inquire into and report upon the plaintiff's title, and ordered that, upon such report being filed, either party should be at liberty to apply to the trial judge for such judgment as he may be entitled to. The defendant now appeals asking that this action be dismissed on two grounds, in addition to that with which I have already dealt, namely, (a) that the fact that the plaintiffs property is foreign land prevents the court decreeing specific performance; (b) that the plaintiff should not have been given a second opportunity to prove his title.\nAs I understand the position of the action, and as counsel for the plaintiff conceded, except perhaps the futility of the defence based on the defendant's inability to convey the north half of the section in question, no substantive right of either party has been determined. The judgment of the provincial appellate court is not final under section 2(e) of the \"Supreme Court Act,\" as amended by 3 & 4 Geo. V., ch. 51, sec. 1, While it may strictly be appealable under section 38 of the \"Supreme Court Act\" as a judgment in an equitable action (see also sec. 45), having regard to the purely discretionary character of the order made and to the fact that it determines nothing against the appellant, there would seem to be grave grounds of objection to this appeal being entertained at all. Moreover, although, there being no cross-appeal, we should assume that the evidence of title adduced by the plaintiff and accepted by the learned trial judge as sufficient was, in fact, insufficient, it would require a very strong and very clear case indeed to justify our interfering with the discretion exercised in giving the plaintiff another opportunity to prove his title, and dismissing his action solely on the ground that he had had his day in court.\nIt is perhaps better, however, that we should express our view upon the other ground of appeal, because, if it should be well taken, the reference directed as to title and proceedings consequent thereon would be useless, and the action should have been, and should now be, dismissed. This question was determined favourably to the plaintiff by Sir Wm. Meredith C.J.O., when Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, in Montgomery v. Ruppensburg[18]. The defendant's objection is really twofold\u2014because the property to be conveyed by the plaintiff is foreign land, he maintains that there is an absence of the mutuality essential to the remedy of specific performance, and that the court lacks jurisdiction to entertain this action.\nThat there is mutuality of obligation under the contract before us is unquestionable, and on that ground the many cases in which courts of equity have refused specific performance of contracts voidable because of incapacity of one of the parties to the contract, e.g., infancy or coverture, are distinguishable. There is in the present case also mutuality of remedy in the sense that the defendant presumably could have had, in the courts of Iowa, relief similar to that which the plaintiff is seeking in Saskatchewan. The closest analogy seems to be presented by a case in which the Statute of Frauds would have afforded a defence to the plaintiff had he been sued for specific performance by the defendant. The plaintiff renders the remedy mutual by bringing the action, and on that ground is allowed to maintain it: Fry on Specific Performance, (5th ed.), par. 470-1. Unilateral contracts afford other instances.\nIf the position of the parties were reversed\u2014that is, if the defendant, resident within Saskatchewan, were the owner of the foreign land and the plaintiff, resident abroad, the owner of the land in Saskatchewan\u2014I could understand the objection taken to the jurisdiction of the court, although I would consider it equally untenable. What is sought in this action is to enforce the conveyance by the defendant, a resident of Saskatchewan, of property in that province in exchange for other property (whether within or without the province is immaterial), which the plaintiff is ready and willing to transfer to him.\nThe jurisdiction of courts of equity, which act in personam, to decree specific performance of a contract for the sale of foreign land, where the person against whom relief is sought, and whose conscience is bound by the agreement, resides within the jurisdiction, is well established: Penn v. Lord Baltimore[19]; British South Africa Co. v. Companhia de Mocambique[20]; Duder v. Amsterdamsch Trustees Kantoor[21]; Ex p. Pollard[22] ; Lord Portarlington v. Soulby[23]; Archer v. Preston[24]. Where the parties were domiciled and the property was situate abroad, it was held, in Davis v. Park[25], that, notwithstanding that the plaintiff and one of the two defendants had come within the jurisdiction, the Vice-Chancellor had exercised a proper discretion in discharging an order made in an action for specific performance giving leave to serve the defendant, who was without the jurisdiction. Moreover, since the jurisdiction rests upon some contract or equity between the parties which presents a case for its exercise in personam (Norris v. Chambres[26]; Re Hawthorne[27]), courts of equity will not entertain actions to determine other rights or questions of title in regard to immoveable property situate abroad (Deschamps v. Miller[28]), or claims which must be enforced directly against the foreign land: Black Point Syndicate v. Eastern Concessions Ltd.[29]; Grey v. Manitoba and North-Western Rly. Co[30]. But no such difficulty presents itself in this case. By bringing his action in the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan, the plaintiff has submitted himself to that court's jurisdiction in personam. He has waived whatever right he had to be sued upon his contract in the forum of his domicile, and has made the remedy in the Saskatchewan court mutual: Martin v. Mitchell[31]. It is in the power of that court to provide, as was provided in the decree pronounced by the learned trial judge, that the defendant shall be required to convey only upon the plaintiff making title and conveying his foreign property, which he has offered to do. Indeed, if it be thought advisable for the protection of the defendant, the court may require that the conveyance of his property to the plaintiff shall remain in the hands of its officer, and shall not be delivered to the plaintiff until his conveyance of the Iowa property has been duly recorded and the officer is satisfied that a clear and satisfactory title to it has been vested in the defendant. The plaintiff seeking relief must submit to whatever terms the court, in the interests of justice, may impose as a condition of granting it. He who seeks equity must do equity. The plaintiff, suing in the court of Saskatchewan, has also submitted to its jurisdiction to decree rescission of the entire contract should he be unable, or for any reason fail, to carry out his obligations under it or to fulfil whatever terms or conditions the court may impose upon him. But, as I have said, I cannot appreciate the ground of the objection made to the jurisdiction. I am unable to find any satisfactory ground of distinction between foreign land and money or chattels as the consideration for and upon receipt of which the defendant is to be required to convey his property.\nI would, for these reasons, affirm the judgment of the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan, and dismiss this appeal with costs.\nBkodeur J.\u2014This appeal should be dismissed. The appellant, Jones, practically obtained from the court of appeal all he required to protect his rights. The objections which he now raises might and will be more properly dealt with when the trial judge is moved to render the judgment which either party might be entitled to.\nAppeal dismissed, with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Allan, Gordon & Gordon.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Mackenzie, Brown & Co.\n[1] 8 Sask.

Idington J contra. Anglin J. dubitante.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1] dismissing the suppliants' petition of right.\nThe appellant, H. H. V. Olmstead, is the owner of rear half of lot number 5 in the 4th concession of the Township of Kitley in the Province of Ontario, and the appellants, H. H. V. Olmstead and W. A. Olmstead, are the owners of the lot number 4 in the said 4th concession of the Township of Kitley. The appellants' titles were proved at the trial, and no question as to them is involved in this appeal. The lands adjoin each other and border on Irish Creek which empties into the Rideau Canal about two and one-half miles below them.\nAt Merrickville, which is situate on the Rideau Canal about five miles below the junction of Irish Creek and the Rideau Canal, a dam was built as part of the construction of the Rideau Canal to control the waters thereof for navigation purposes.\nAt the time of the construction of the Rideau Canal a depth of about 5 feet 3 inches of water on the locksill at the Merrickville lock was established, which continued until 1890 when the depth was raised to six feet. The appellants' lands are not flooded when the water on the locksill does not exceed six feet.\nDuring many of the years between 1890 and 1914 when the petitions of right were filed, the depth of the water on the locksill exceeded six feet whereby the appellants' lands were flooded, and a large portion of them was rendered useless. The appellant, when acquiring the lands in question, acquired the rights of their grantors to claim damages for flooding which had occurred during the ownerships of such grantors.\nThe defences to the actions were the following:\u2014\n1. Acquisition of a right to flood by reason of the purchase from one Gideon Olmstead of his rights to do so as owner of a mill and mill dam on Irish Creek.\n2. Prescription under the Acts relating to the Rideau Canal.\n3. Prescription under the \"Limitations Act\" of the Province of Ontario.\n4. Lost grant.\n5. Non-assignability of the claims for damages which belonged to the appellants' grantors.\n6. Obstructions in Irish Creek impeding the flow of the water.\nThe learned judge of the Exchequer Court held that the Crown had not established any prescriptive right to flood the appellants' lands, but he held that the appellants' rights of action were barred by the 26th section of 8 Geo. IV., ch. I. (U.C.), this statute being the original Act providing for the construction of the Rideau Canal.\nThe learned judge did not deal with any of the other defences raised by the Crown.\nSinclair K.C. for the appellants.\nlegal liability for a tort when it was passed. See Philipps v. Rees (1), The Queen v. Yule (2), at page 30 Smellie for the respondent.\nSinclair K.C. for the appellants. Under sec. 20, sub-sec. (c) of the \"Exchequer Court Act,\" the Crown is liable, if the cause of injury arises on a public work, though the property injured is not situate thereon. Price v. The King[2], Letourneux v. The King[3].\nThe limitation clause in the \"Rideau Canal Act\" could not apply to the Crown, which was under no legal liability for a tort when it was passed. See Philipps v. Rees[4], The Queen v. Yule[5], at page 30\nSinclair K.C. for the appellants.\nSmellie for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I think these petitions of right were properly dismissed and whilst agreeing with the reasons for judgment of the judge of the Exchequer Court I am disposed to think the judgment could be supported on more than one ground.\nIn particular I am of the opinion that it is a good defence to the suit that any such assignment of a right to bring it as set up is illegal. The lands were purchased by the petitioners as to part in the year 1904 and as to the rest in the year 1912, the petitioners by deeds of even date with the conveyances obtaining from the grantors what purported to be an assignment of the latter's rights to certain claims to recover from His Majesty compensation for flooding the lands since the 1st January, 1890. In the petitions of right it is alleged that the\nsuppliants' said lands have during each year since and including the year 1890 been overflowed and flooded by waters of the Rideau Canal and have thereby been rendered entirely useless.\nIt is perfectly clear that what the petitioners purchased and intended to purchase was this so-called right to a claim to recover against the Crown.\nThe policy of the law has always been opposed to this trading in litigious rights and such transactions are to be discouraged in every possible way. They, of course, have nothing in common with assignments of debts and choses in action which by statute are now permitted.\nWhilst the assignment of a right to litigation is forbidden as between subjects, the rule must apply with greater force in the case of the Crown, since the subject has no right to sue the Crown but can only present a petition of right. There being no such thing as a right to a claim to recover against the Crown, there can be no assignment of any such pretended right.\nI think this constitutes not only a good legal defence, but also disposes of any merits the claims might be supposed to have.\nThe appellants have in the course of the proceedings set up a different claim from anything alleged in their pleadings. In their factum they say:\u2014\nThe appellants' lands are not flooded when the water on the locksill does not exceed 6 feet, * * *\nAgain\nIt is established that the lockmaster at Merrickville was expressly instructed to hold only 6 feet of water on the locksill * * *\nThe instructions to the lockmaster shew that any flooding that occurred resulted from the disobedience of the lockmaster who did not observe the instructions given to him.\nThis, however, is not sufficient to entitle the appellants to claim under sec. 20 (c) of the \"Exchequer Court Act,\" for that section not only requires that the injury to the property should have resulted from the negligence of a Crown servant, but also that it should have occurred on a public work. According to the evidence Merrickville is 10 miles away.\nDavies J.\u2014I think this appeal must be dismissed with costs. I am unable to distinguish it from the cases of Paul v. The King[6] and Chamberlin v. The King[7], the decisions in which I think must govern in this case.\nIdington J.\u2014I cannot agree with the view expressed by the learned trial judge that 8 Geo. IV., ch. 1, sec. 26, furnished a bar to this action. The point made by Mr. Sinclair that the Crown not being named in the section, and that indeed at the time when the Act was passed there could have been no relief sought against the Crown, seems well taken, and to put beyond doubt the possibility of the legislature having contemplated in passing the section in question that it should apply to anything but what it expresses.\nStatutes of limitation are not to be extended beyond that which they plainly express. No case exactly in point has been cited nor have I been able to find any, but the converse cases of Lambert v. Taylor[8] and The King v. Battams[9], seem to illustrate the principles that should govern.\nThe claims seem to arise only out of isolated acts, where through the neglect of some one acting on behalf of the Crown, the waters in the Rideau Canal were raised beyond the six feet limit, which, if observed, would on the evidence produce no damage to the suppliants.\nIt does not appear to me that any such acts of non-continuous negligence, occurring at various times, could give any prescriptive right, especially when any claim of right in respect thereof is denied by respondent.\nNor does it appear to me on the facts that the instructions of the superintendent having been disobeyed and the acts being those of others employed by respondent neglecting their duty being the cause of damage, should furnish any defence herein.\nIt seems to me from the evidence that the record of these results should have come under the observation of some one in authority for whom the respondent should be held responsible.\nI have not observed anything put forward in the argument shewing that due care had been taken to check such objectionable irregularities and their consequences.\nEven if so existent I doubt the efficacy of such a defence.\nThe other members of the court have unanimously concluded that the appeal must be dismissed, and I, seeing no useful purpose to be served by me prosecuting my researches in this voluminous record to find out and determine in regard to that and other features of the case, must be content with remaining in doubt.\nIt may also be that the appellants are without any remedy but that falling within sub-section (c) of section 20 of the \"Exchequer Court Act\" put forward in the appellants' factum and the peculiarities of that sub-section may be held to be such as to give no remedy to them because the property damaged is not.\"on a public work.\"\nThis latter point was not taken or argued but has been forced on our notice in the Piggot Case[10] (argued this term. The case of Chamberlin v. The King[11], might also on argument have been found a bar to this action.\nUnder the circumstances I can only submit these considerations without assenting to or dissenting from the judgment to be delivered.\nAnglin J.\u2014As at present advised I gravely doubt whether section 26 of 8 Geo. IV., ch. 1 (U.C.), relied upon by the learned judge of the Exchequer Court, applies to a claim against the Crown. The plaintiff's claim, however, is for damages for injuries sustained through the negligence of a Crown servant in carrying on a public work. The injury of which he complains did not happen on the public work. Section 20 (c) of the \"Exchequer Court Act,\" therefore, does not confer jurisdiction on the Exchequer Court. Chamberlin v. The King[12], Paul v. The King[13]. Since these cases were decided Letourneux v. The Queen[14], cannot be followed in such a case as this. In that case the full limitative effect of the words \"on any public work\" in sub-sec. (c) of sec. 20 would appear not to have been sufficiently considered. The suppliant points to no other provision giving him a right of action against the Crown.\nBrodeur J.\u2014This is an appeal from the Exchequer Court which dismissed the appellants' petition of right.\nIt is claimed by the appellants that their properties were flooded by the waters of the Rideau Canal.\nSeveral grounds of defence were urged by the respondent but the petitions were dismissed on the ground that the appellants' rights of action were barred by the statute providing for the construction of the Rideau Canal. By the 26th section of that statute (8 Geo. IV., ch. 1, in 1827), it was provided that any suit in damages against any person for anything done in execution of the powers conferred by that law should be brought within six months\nafter the act committed, or in case there shall be a continuation of damages, then within six calendar months next after the doing or committing of such damages shall cease and not afterwards.\nWhen that Act was passed the right to sue the Crown did not exist.\nIn 1870 a law was passed authorizing the reference to official arbitrators appointed under the provisions of the Act of 1867 (31 Vict., ch. 12), of claims arising out of any death or any injury to person or property on any public work, provided (sec. 2) that nothing herein contained shall be construed as making it imperative on the government to entertain any claim under this Act.\nIn 1887 the \"Exchequer Court Act\" was passed and it was provided that those claims in damages against the Crown could be prosecuted by petition of right and exclusive jurisdiction thereon was given to the Exchequer Court.\nIt is contended by the appellants that the limitation enacted by the statute concerning the Rideau Canal would not apply to damages claimed against the Crown because no right of action existed against the Crown at the time the statute was passed.\nAt that time the action for damages suffered in respect of the canal could be instituted only against the contractors and the officers who may have caused the damages. If later on the liability was extended to the Crown then the provisions of the statutes would apply to the Crown as well as to the other persons.\nThe limitation section should benefit the Crown as well as the others.\nIt has been found by the court below that within the six months previous to the petitions of right no damages had been suffered by the appellants. Then they were barred from making any claim for damages against the Crown under the provisions of the 26th section of chapter 1 of 1827.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: R.

Davies J. dissented.\nPer Idington and Brodeur JJ.\u2014Such a by-law is valid although passed without the assent of the ratepayers previously obtained. British Columbia Railway Co. v. Stewart ( (1913) A.C. 816) and United Buildings Corporation v. City of Vancouver ( (1915) A.C. 345) applied.\nThe decision of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia on a previous appeal in the same proceedings (21 B.C. Rep. 401) was approved.\nAPPEAL, per saltum, from the judgment of Murphy J., in the Supreme Court of British Columbia, maintaining the plaintiffs' action to enforce an award of arbitrators appointed under the compulsory provisions of the British Columbia \"Municipal Act.\" In 1913, the council of the municipality entered into an agreement with the Pacific Great Eastern Railway Co., determining the location of the company's railway through the municipality, by which the company was permitted to construct its line of railway upon a longitudinal strip of a public highway in front of lands belonging to the plaintiffs, and a by-law was passed by the council to give effect to the agreement. The assent of the ratepayers to the passing of the bylaw had not been previously obtained. The agreement and by-law had the effect of narrowing the highway where it passed by the plaintiffs' lands, as the strip of land on that side of the highway given by the railway company in exchange for the portion stopped up and transferred to the company for the purposes of its railway was not sufficient to restore the highway to its former width. The plaintiffs claimed compensation, and obtained an order from Mr. Justice Clement consolidating the several applications and appointing arbitrators to determine the amount of the compensation to be allowed under the provisions of the \"Municipal Act\" in that respect. On an appeal from the order of Clement J., the Court of Appeal for British Columbia affirmed the order[1] and held that the municipal corporation had power to close the strip of highway in question from traffic, and that the plaintiffs, as owners of lands abutting thereon, were entitled to compensation for the injury they thereby sustained, to be determined by arbitration as ordered. The arbitrators then proceeded with the arbitration, awarded damages to the plaintiffs, and the action was brought by them for the purpose of enforcing the award and obtaining pay- ment from the municipality of the amount of compensation allowed them.\nAt the trial, the plaintiff's action was maintained by Mr. Justice Murphy, and the municipal corporation, in view of the circumstances stated, were granted special leave to appeal, per saltum, to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nLafleur K.C. and R. M. Macdonald for the appellant.\nJames A. Harvey K.C. for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014The principal question on this appeal involves the validity of a by-law passed in the following circumstances by the municipality appellant.\nThe Pacific Great Eastern Railway Co., a provincial company, authorized by the legislature to be carried along any existing highway, subject to leave having first been obtained from the Minister of Railways and to the consent of the municipality within the limits of which the highway is situate\u2014the consent of the municipality being evidenced by a by-law\u2014 located its line along the north shore of English Bay. The appellant, being of opinion that, in the best interests of the municipality, it was desirable to change that location, proposed that\ninstead of being carried along the foreshore, the railway should be carried along a more northerly location as shewn on a plan submitted to the corporation.\nThe railway company accepted the proposal, and made the change upon the following, among other, conditions. The council of the municipality was to give its consent to the company carrying its line or lines of railway upon, along or across the southerly forty\u2014six feet of an unnamed highway, with full and exclusive right to the company forever to use and enjoy the same for the purposes of its undertaking. The company also undertook to purchase two strips of land, and out of those strips to dedicate twenty feet in width to the municipality, to be used as a highway, so that there would be on either side of the railway right-of-way two highways, each twenty feet in width, available for traffic. It has not been contended that by this bargain the municipality did not get ample consideration for the privileges granted the company. To give effect to this agreement a by-law was passed conferring on the council of the municipality power to \"stop up and close from traffic as a highway\" the said southerly forty-six feet of the highway, and to indemnify the company against claims or suits arising out of that proceeding. The effect of the by-law was to narrow the highway somewhat and to relieve the company of its statutory obligation to restore it after the rails were laid.\nActions were brought against the municipality by the plaintiff respondent and some sixteen others to enforce awards of arbitrators appointed to fix the compensation due them as owners of adjoining lands by reason of the narrowing of the highway, and the question for decision is: Had the corporation power by by-law to close a section of the highway in the circumstances set forth? The provincial Court of Appeal, on a previous appeal in these proceedings[2] maintained the by-law on the ground that by section 52, subsection 176, of the \"Municipal Act\" power is given to municipal corporations to pass by-laws\nfor establishing, opening, making, preserving, improving, repairing, widening, altering, diverting or stopping up public highways, and that those powers, read in the light of sub-section 193 of the same section, are sufficient to authorize the closing to traffic of the strip of the highway in question. I am of the same opinion, and would suggest that sub-section 190, referring to bicycle paths, might also be considered in this connection. It may be that, in certain aspects, the by-law is of doubtful validity, but the only objection urged here and in the court below is thus, stated in appellant's factum:\u2014\nThe municipality defend this action on the same point of law as previously taken before Mr. Justice Clement and before the Court of Appeal, viz.,'that the council of 1913 had no power to stop up the strip of highway, that the assuming to do so was an ultra vires act, and, hence, no case existed for compensation, and the appointment of arbitrators was invalid.\nIt is not suggested that there was misconduct on the part of the council or that any of its members were moved by improper motives, and the provincial courts, which are necessarily more familiar with local conditions than we are, maintained the validity of the bylaw. The arrangement made appears to be a reasonable one and in the public interest. In any event, as Chancellor Boyd said in Re Karry and City of Chatham[3] :\u2014\nThe court is not to sit in judgment upon the propriety or alleged unwisdom of the by-law if it admits of reasonable justification.\nSee also Rogers v. City of Toronto[4], at page 601, and in Kruse v. Johnson[5] , at page 99, it was said that by-laws of public representative bodies ought to be supported if possible.\nThe broad language of section 52, sub-section 176, read with 193 and 190, is sufficient to justify the action of the municipality in stopping up the strip of high- way in question in the special circumstances of this case.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nDAVIES J. (dissenting).\u2014This is an appeal, per saltum, from the judgment of Mr. Justice Murphy, which involves a previous decision in these proceedings by the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[6] , the effect of which was to declare that power was vested by section 52, sub-section 176, of the \"Municipal Act\" to \"narrow\" a public highway, so that a railway company might have, when approved of by the Minister of Railways and the consent of the municipality, the right to run its line along a public highway, a question not in dispute, but a right to the exclusive possession of a strip of the highway.\nThe facts are stated in the judgment of Chief Justice Macdonald as follows:\u2014\nThe appellant, a municipal corporation, entered into an agreement with the Pacific Great Eastern Railway Company, giving the company liberty to carry its line of railway along a public highway within the boundaries of the municipality, together with the exclusive right of possession of a strip of the highway 46 feet wide, which strip the appellant by by-law closed to public traffic. This left still open to traffic a strip of 20 feet in width of the original road allowance along the northerly side of the portion which has been so closed.\nThe railway company, on its part, agreed to purchase and dedicate as a highway a strip of land 20 feet wide on the southerly side of the said closed strip, so that the result of the by-law and agreement combined was that highways 20 feet in width were provided for traffic on each side of that portion of the original highway which was stopped up as aforesaid.\nThe sole question, apart from one of res judicata mentioned later, is whether the said sub-section 176 gave the municipality the power to narrow as well as to widen highways.\nIf they had such power, then the by-law purporting to give the exclusive right of possession to the railway company of a strip of the highway 46 feet wide which the respondent corporation closed to public traffic cannot be impeached.\nI am of the opinion that the section in question does not give them such power. It was evidently carefully drawn and gave power to municipal corporations to pass by-laws\nfor establishing, opening, making, preserving, improving, repairing, widening, altering, diverting or stopping up public highways.\nNo express power to \"narrow\" such highways is given, and when such care seems to have been taken to expressly confer so many intended powers, it does not seem that a fair construction of the expressed powers would justify the inclusion of other powers very largely affecting the public rights and interests and not expressly given. Power to \"widen\" is given, also to \"alter\" or \"divert\" or to \"stop up,\" and the use of these several powers and phrases seems to me to indicate the length to which the legislature thought it desirable to go.\nThe general policy of the Legislature of British Columbia seems, from the \"Highways Act\" and the land registry Acts, that these highways should not be less than 66 feet wide.\nIf the legislature intended to give municipalities power to narrow a highway 66 feet wide to one of 20 feet\u2014a power which might so largely affect the general public\u2014they surely would have expressed that intention by the use of the word \"narrow\" or some equivalent word.\nThe power to \"alter\" does not, I think include the power to narrow; if it did, it would also include the powers to \"improve, repair, widen and stop up,\" which are each expressly given, and would be surplusage if \"alter\" included them. I think that, as contended for, the word alter should be limited to such acts as are not inconsistent with the highway as such.\nIf my construction is right, the by-law is void, and that disposes of the question of res adjudicata. Toronto Railway Co. v. Toronto Corporation[7].\nI would allow the appeal and declare the by-law in question void.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014This is an action to enforce an award for compensation allowed to proprietors of lands adjoining a highway on account of the closing of part thereof.\nThe contention of the appellant herein is that its council had no power by virtue of section 53 of the \"Municipal Act,\" enabling it to make by-laws, and pursuant to one of the objects of such power expressed in sub-section 176, which reads as follows:\u2014\nFor establishing, opening, making, preserving, improving, repairing, widening, altering, diverting, or stopping up roads, streets, squares, alleys, lanes, bridges or other public thoroughfares,\nto close the part of the highway in question\nThe by-law in question closed a strip 46 feet wide on the southerly side of a street 66 feet wide.\nAn agreement was entered into with a railway company whereby it was provided that the railway company should occupy and use the part so closed, and secure for appellant a new road 20 feet wide on the southerly side of the said 46-foot strip. The effect of the agreement being carried out would be that the respective proprietors and the public would have, in lieu of the old road allowance, two roads of 20 feet wide, one on each side of the railway, and that the railway company would abandon its application pending before the proper authority to construct its proposed railway along the adjacent foreshore.\nThe cross streets were not to be closed. The neat point is whether or not the council acted ultra vires in closing part of the street.\nThe sub-section in question evidently was copied substantially from Ontario legislation tracing back to the origin of municipal institutions in that province when known as Upper Canada.\nBeyond all manner of doubt the power to close or \"stop up\" cross sectional parts of streets has been exercised in scores of cases, and, so long as not depriving people of ingress and egress to their properties, has been treated as within the power of the respective municipal councils having jurisdiction over their highways.\nI am unable to distinguish as a matter of legal construction the power to close a cross\u2014section from that to close a longitudinal section of a street.\nThe occasions for exercising the former class certainly will, in number, far exceed those likely to happen in the latter class. I should be loath to cast a possible doubt upon the titles of those, in Ontario, for example, resting upon such an exercise of municipal power conferred by said language.\nThe words \"alter\" and \"stop up\" comprehend the whole, if need be, and surely as descriptive of a bare power must be held to cover the part in either class of cases.\nI think that the closing of part of the street was, as held by the Court of Appeal, on a previous appeal in these proceedings[8] , intra vires the council, and hence the appeal should fail.\nThe question of whether or not the motive for doing so was proper is one that, if impeachable, should have been attacked by way of a motion or action to quash. So long as the by-law stands, and is intra vires, I do not think it can be treated as void and proceedings thereunder held null.\nWe heard much argument on the illegality of the bargain and the impropriety of it. It may be, when due regard is had to sections 332 and 333 of the Act, that the effect of closing the street was to leave the land vested in the Crown, and the acts of the Minister authorizing the railway company may turn out to have been rested on the right of the Crown to so appropriate the land so abandoned by the exercise of the council in closing the street. Indeed, that may have been part of the scheme for meeting a complicated situation arising out of a desire to save the foreshore from railway invasion.\nI express no opinion on the subject of the right in law to do so. I only desire to point out that others not parties to this proceeding ought to be before the court and be fully heard before we should pass upon such an inquiry as started thus.\nTo allow the appeal and dismiss the respondent's action, which seems well founded, would possibly leave the maintenance of this application and use of part of the highway to continue and respondent without a remedy, for the judgment could not bind the Crown or the railway company.\nThe decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the case of the British Columbia Electric Railway Company v. Stewart[9] and the United Buildings Corporation v. City of Vancouver[10] seem to render untenable the objection to the by-law by reason of its not having the sanction of the ratepayers. I do not overlook the principle that what cannot in law be done directly cannot properly be accomplished by an indirect and improper method.\nIf there was anything done for the mere purpose of evading the salutary provision requiring submission to the electorate, then it should have been developed by bringing all concerned before the court as already suggested.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014I am not prepared to overrule the unanimous judgment of the British Columbia Court of Appeal, in the previous appeal in these proceedings[11] holding that, under the powers conferred by section 53, sub-sec. 176, of the \"Municipal Act\" (R.S.B.C., 1911, ch. 170), the appellant municipal corporation has power to partially stop up a highway, as was done in this case. It may be that the circumstances under which the by-law in question was passed and the motives that prompted it were such that in a proper proceeding it might have been quashed. But in this action, brought to recover the amount of compensation awarded in consequence of the partial closing of the highway, upon the issue as to the validity of the by-law the only question open is the power of the municipal corporation to pass it. I express no opinion upon the estoppel invoked by the respondent alleged to arise out of the proceedings on the application for the appointment of arbitrators.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014This is an appeal, per saltum, from a judgment rendered by the Supreme Court of British Columbia confirming the award of arbitrators appointed under the provisions of the \"Municipal Act\" of British Columbia. The corporation appellant, in its st te- ment of defence, claims that the appointment of arbitrators was ultra vires, and that its own by-law, which has given rise to the claim for compensation, was ultra vires.\nWhen the application was made by the present respondents for the appointment of the arbitrators, the questions now raised in the statement of defence were also raised before the judge of the Supreme Court to whom the application had been made, and he decided that he had jurisdiction, that he could appoint the arbitrators, and his judgment was unanimously confirmed by the Court of Appeal.[12]\nI agree with the Court of Appeal in the construction they have made of section 53, sub-section 176, of the \"Municipal Act,\" and I concur in the reasons which have been given by the Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal on that question.\nIt was claimed by the appellant that the by-law in question in this case should have been submitted to the electors.\nI find, however, a decision of the Privy Council in the case of United Buildings Corporation v. City of Vancouver[13] in which it was decided that a by-law stopping up part of a street did not require the sanction of the municipal electors.\nFor these reasons, I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Bird, Macdonald & Ross.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Taylor, Harvey, Grant, Stockton & Smith.\n[1] 21 B.C.

At the port of loading the lumber of dimensions customary in the trade at that port, was furnished in quantity sufficient to fill a ship of the \"Helen's\" tonnage, but it could not all be stowed in that ship, which was built for the fruit trade, and could not take a full cargo of lumber of that size. The quantity loaded was delivered at St. John, and the shipowner brought action for the freight on the deficiency.\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed against (44 N.B. Rep. 12), that it was the duty of the owners to provide a ship capable of carrying the cargo called for by the charter party; that the evidence established that the \"Helen\" was not so capable; that the charterer, having furnished lumber of the dimensions customary at the port for loading ships of the size of the \"Helen,\" had discharged his duty under the contract, and was not liable to the owner for the dead freight.\nUnder the demurrage clause of the charter party, the owners claimed damages for delay in loading and discharging the cargo.\nHeld, that the manner in which the ship was constructed prevented the work of loading and discharging the lumber from proceeding as fast as it otherwise would have done; the delay was, therefore, imputable to the owners themselves and the charterer was not liable. APPEAL from a decision of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick[1], reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the defendant.\nThe material facts of the case are stated in the above head-note.\nPowell K.C. and F. R. Taylor K.C. for the appellants.\nPowell K.C. and F. R. Taylor K.C. for the appellants. The charterers tendered a full and complete cargo of the goods contracted. See Steamship Isis Co. v. Bahr & Co.[2]; Furness v. Charles Tennant, Sons & Co.[3]. He is not bound to offer a cargo suitable for the particular ship. Stanton v. Richardson[4].\nAs to the claim for demurrage, see Postlethwaite v. Freeland[5].\nTeed K.C. for the respondents. The appellants have not fulfilled their contract to furnish a full and complete cargo. If they wanted long lengths of lumber carried, they should have ascertained the ship's capacity. See Carnegie v. Conner[6].; Mackill v. Wright Bros.[7].\nAs to demurrage, Scrutton on Charter Parties (7 ed.) at pages 283 et seq.\nPowell K.C. and F. R. Taylor K.C. for the appellants.\nTeed K.C. for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed. The notes of my brother judges, both here and below, are so complete that anything I add must be mere surplusage. In my view, the case lies within a very narrow compass. The respondent's undertaking, in the terms of the charterparty, was to furnish a vessel \"in every way fitted\" to receive on board and carry from Apalachicola, Florida, to St. John, N.B., a full and complete cargo, both under and upon deck, of re-sawn yellow pine lumber. And the obligation of the appellants, the shippers, was to deliver an average cargo of the kind described alongside and within reach of the vessel's tackle. A cargo of re-sawn yellow pine lumber of the average lengths and sizes was delivered as provided for, but was not received on board the vessel because of its peculiar construction. It is not disputed that the cargo furnished the \"Helen\" was, as to sizes and dimensions, the same as had been furnished under similar charters for years at Apalachicola. In their factum the respondents admit that the ship and cargo were not suited to each other. The vessel was fitted out for the fruit trade, and not at all adapted, in accordance with the terms of the charterparty, to receive the lumber which the appellants chartered her to carry. I fail to understand how it can be assumed that the onus was upon the appellants to ascertain whether the ship which the respondents chartered to them to receive a full and complete cargo of lumber, was adapted to carry such a cargo. The special construction and equipment of the vessel was a fact within the peculiar knowledge of the respondents, who must also be assumed to know, when they made the charterparty, what was meant by the term \"a cargo of re-sawn yellow pine lumber.\" At the time the charterparty was entered into, the vessel lay in New York Harbour, and the appellants never saw her until she arrived in St. John. In any event, the respondents' contract was to provide a vessel fitted for the cargo and to receive on board the merchandize mentioned in the charterparty, and this they failed to do, and they must suffer for the consequences. The appeal should be allowed with costs. Davies J.\u2014The controversy in this appeal is as to the respective obligations of the owner and charterer of a ship chartered by the appellants to carry\na full and complete cargo both under and upon deck of re-sawn yellow pine lumber\nfrom Apalachicola, Florida, to St. John, N.B.\nThe action was brought by the owners against the charterers to recover damages by way of demurrage or detention and also for dead freight.\nThe contention of the plaintiff owner was that the charterer was obliged to furnish the steamer with such lengths of lumber as she could well stow and carry to her full capacity, and that, as no special lengths of the \"re-sawn yellow pine lumber\" were mentioned, the charterer was bound to furnish such lengths only as the steamer could carry, and, not having done so, but having offered timber of lengths the steamer could not carry, was liable for the damages for the dead freight, and that the trade usage did not apply or control.\nThe defendant's contention, on the other hand, was that he was only bound to provide the lumber stipulated for of the ordinary lengths and dimensions in that trade, and that the accepted trade meaning of the term \"re-sawn yellow pine lumber\" is such lumber, sawn on four sides, without reference to lengths or dimensions, and that the lumber he furnished was such as was well known to and in the trade as re-sawn yellow pine lumber, sawn on four sides, and practically the same as that furnished by his company under similar charters for many years. There was much difference of judicial opinion in the courts below. The learned trial judge held:\u2014\nIn view of all this evidence, I think it is abundantly clear that the cargo furnished to the \"Helen\" at the loading port was quite in accordance with the charter party and the claim for dead freight cannot be allowed. I find as a fact that the ship \"Helen\" was unsuitable for the carriage of the freight the plaintiff company engaged to carry, and that defendant company fulfilled its obligation by furnishing a full and complete cargo of re-sawn yellow pine lumber to the plaintiff company's ship \"Helen\" at the loading port.\nAs to the detention, it is to be noted that, so far as such claim concerns the port of loading, it rests wholly on the contention that time was lost because the cargo furnished was of unsuitable dimensions.\nHe further found:\u2014\nIt is unnecessary for me to recapitulate the evidence of this witness in his description of the particulars, in which he says that \"Helen's\" construction and equipment delayed the discharge. His testimony convinces me that the delay was due to the ship itself, and not to the presence of the schooner complained of and certainly not to the defendant. The evidence of every witness who speaks of the build and equipment of the steamer\u2014even that of Mr. Duckett himself\u2014confirms me in the conclusion above expressed.\nOn appeal to the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Chief Justice McLeod was of the opinion that the defendant company was obliged to fill the steamer to her full carrying capacity and to furnish such lengths of \"re-sawn yellow pine lumber as she could carry.\" Not having done so, he held the defendant liable for the dead freight and for the demurrage at Apalachicola arising out of the fact that the steamer was unable to stow 150,000 feet per day owing to the long lengths of lumber supplied. For the same reasons he held defendants liable for the seven days' demurrage at St. John in unloading. Grimmell J. concurred with the Chief Justice, while Barry J., in a lengthy, reasoned judgment, in which he cites and discusses most of the authorities bearing upon the dispute, agreed with the trial judge.\nAs a fact it seems clear from the evidence and the argument at bar that, while the cargo tendered to the ship was an ordinary cargo of re-sawn yellow pine lumber mentioned in the charterparty, the steamer could not be called an ordinary steamer of her tonnage. On the contrary, she was of a special and unusual build and construction and fitted to meet the requirements of a special trade, the West India fruit trade.\nI cannot find any answer, in view of the evidence given of the usage in the yellow pine lumber trade, to the proposition stated by Barry J. that:\u2014\nIf the cargo tendered was (as found) an ordinary one and the ship was an unusual and abnormal one, it would be consonant to both sense and reason to say that any loss which may have been occasioned by reason of the unsuitableness of the cargo for the ship or the ship for the cargo ought to be borne by the shipowners, and that the rights and obligations of the parties must be determined by the written contract, the construction of which is for the court without regard to any consideration as to the knowledge of either party with respect to the character of the ship or cargo.\nThe legal proposition which he deduces from the authorities and on which he based his conclusions was that a shipowner, by entering into a charterparty, impliedy undertakes that the ship shall be reasonably fit for the carriage of a reasonable cargo of the kind stipulated for in the charter, and that the reasonable cargo to be supplied must be of the kind specified in the charter.\nThe case of Stanton v. Richardson[8], in 1872, affirmed in the Exchequer Chamber[9] in 1874, and in the House of Lords[10], in 1875, fully sustains this proposition formulated by Barry J. Mr. Justice Brett says, at page 435 of the report in the Common Pleas:\u2014\nI think the obligation of the shipowner is to supply a ship reasonably fit to carry the cargo stipulated for in the charter party,\nciting as authorities, Lyon v. Mells[11]; Gibson v. Small[12]; Havelock v. Geddes[13]. And see Blackburn J. in Readhead v. Midland Railway Co.[14].\nApplying this principle, Barry J. held that the findings of fact of the trial judge shewed the cargo tendered at Apalachicola to have been an ordinary and reasonable cargo of re-sawn yellow pine lumber as called for by the charter; that the steamer was not a reasonable ship for the cargo offered; and that he could not say the evidence was insufficient to support the finding that the delay in discharging the vessel in St. John was not occasioned by the fault of the charterers, but was wholly attributable to the unusual construction and equipment of the ship.\nAfter hearing all that could be said in support of the judgment appealed from, and after reading and carefully considering the charterparty and the different parts of the evidence called to our attention by Mr. Teed, I have reached the conclusion that the proposition of law on which the Chief Justice and Grimmell J. based their conclusions, namely, that it was incumbent on the defendant company to furnish the steamer with such lengths of lumber as she could stow and carry, and that, having furnished lumber of lengths which prevented the steamer stowing or discharging 150,000 feet per running day, they were liable as well for the dead freight as for the demurrage alike in Apalachicola as in St. John, cannot be supported. On the contrary, I am of the opinion that the judgment of Mr. Justice Barry, founded upon the findings of the trial judge, is substantially right and is supported by the highest authorities.\nThe question whether the re-sawn yellow pine lumber offered the ship was of reasonable length was one of fact. The evidence shewed that it was of the customary and usual lengths of that kind of timber shipped in the trade at Apalachicola. That being so, I hold, as the trial judge found, that it was a reasonable cargo to be carried under the charterparty; that the obligation of the charterer had been discharged when he offered it; and that the inability of the steamer to carry such lengths of timber owing to her peculiar construction was a failure on the part of the shipowner to furnish a suitable vessel to carry that cargo, or, as put by the Lord Chancellor, in the case of Stanton v. Richardson[15],\nto provide a ship which is reasonably suited to carry that particular cargo.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal and restore, the judgment of the trial judge, with costs in all the courts.\nIdington J.\u2014I agree with the construction put by the learned trial judge and Mr. Justice Barry, in the Court of Appeal, upon the charterparty in question, herein.\nI assume, as they seem to dp, that a shipowner, tendering a vessel for a specified service, must supply one reasonably fit for the purpose of being loaded with the freight specified in general terms, as in the charter party.\nThey have dealt, so fully with the evidence and, legal authorities applicable thereto that. I cannot add anything useful, for I agree in the general line of reasoning they have adopted in relation thereto, so far as the claim set up for loss of freight and loss by delay in loading is concerned. If there had been evidence that any substantial part of the freight tendered was of such lengths that men of experience and judgment should say that it was unreasonable to expect it to be shipped on \"a vessel of 635 tons net register,\" specified to be that of the \"Helen,\" the vessel in question, there might be room for Mr. Teed's argument being given effect to.\nHe has had to contend for that without evidence to support it, and, indeed, is hence driven to urge, what I think is not founded in law, that the charterer takes the risk beyond even that, and must be held to know of the fitness or unfitness of the vessel he charters for the service he contracts for. I cannot assent to such a proposition.\nThe unfitness of the vessel for the service for which her brokers and in effect owners for the time being tendered her, seems to have been the cause of the loss of time in loading and unloading.\nIn regard to the loss of time unloading, I wish to guard against committing myself to the proposition that, in the case of such a charterparty as before us, the rules governing the harbour master or his hard necessities must bind the parties concerned.\nThe learned trial judge seems to me to have set that aside for the purpose of this case, and attributed the loss to other causes. In doing so, I cannot find he conflicted with the evidence.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014Upon the evidence I am satisfied that the cargo tendered by the defendant was reasonable and such as a vessel chartered for the purpose of carrying a cargo of \"re-sawn yellow pine lumber\" from Apalachicola should be able to load to her full capacity. That the plaintiffs' vessel was unable to do so was, I think, due to her peculiar construction and the fact that she had been outfitted for fruit carriage, rendering her unsuitable for the business for which she was chartered to the defendant, and thus involving a breach of the plaintiffs' obligation under the charter. The incapacity of the steamer was the cause of the loss of dead freight of which the plaintiffs complain, and also of the demurrage at the port of loading. I agree with the learned trial judge that the evidence would not warrant a recovery by the plaintiffs for the seven days' demurrage at the port of St. John for which they claim. Apparently there was also a delay at St. John of one-half a day, for which the respondents might perhaps be liable, occasioning damage amounting to $50. On the other hand, had he counterclaimed, the defendant would probably be entitled to a larger sum as damages for failure of the plaintiffs' ship to take the full cargo provided for her.\nOn the whole, I agree in the conclusions reached by the learned trial judge and by Barry J., who dissented in the Appeal Division, and would allow this appeal with costs and restore the judgment dismissing the action with costs.\nBrodeur J. agrees with Mr. Justice Anglin.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Fred.

In doing the work for which it was hired, the crane fell and D. was killed. In an action by his widow for damages, the jury found that the crane was a dangerous machine and that the Steel Company was negligent in not having a rigger to superintend its operation.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Appellate Division (35 Ont. L.R. 371), that the Steel Company owed to D. the duty of seeing that the crane was properly operated; that the evidence justified the finding of the jury that a rigger was necessary for that purpose; and that the judgment against that company should stand.\nThe jury also found that the crane was defective when delivered to the Steel Company, and that the Paper Company was guilty of negligence in not supplying proper equipment for it.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Appellate Division, Davies and Idington JJ. dissenting, that the relation of master and servant existed between the Paper Company and D. up to the time of the latter\u2019s death; that the company, in sending D. to run a dangerous machine not properly equipped, would be responsible for any injury caused by its operation; and that it was not relieved from responsibility by the fact that the injury might have been avoided if the Steel Company had provided proper superintendence over its operation.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff against the Algoma Steel Corporation and dismissing her action against the Lake Superior Paper Company.\nThe appellant is the widow of the late Martin P. Dub\u00e9, and the action was brought by her, on behalf of herself and the children of the deceased, against the Algoma Steel Corporation, Limited (herein referred to as the Steel Company) and the Lake Superior Paper Company for damages resulting from the death of the said Martin P. Dub\u00e9.\nPrior to the 28th day of May, 1914, the Steel Company hired from the Superior Company a derrick or crane, with its crew, consisting of the deceased, as the operator thereof, and a fireman, to perform certain work upon the premises of the Steel Company. The derrick was duly delivered to the Steel Company by the Superior Company and a considerable amount of work was done with it on the 28th day of May, 1914, all without any mishap.\nOn the 29th day of May, 1914, the deceased was advised by the foreman of the Steel Company that it would be necessary to move a large iron tank weighing something less than five tons from the trestle or stand upon which it was resting to a flat car which had been placed to receive the tank. The trestle or stand was approximately twelve feet high, and the tank to be moved therefrom was of the following dimensions\u2014 twelve feet wide, sixteen feet long, and four and one-half feet high.\nThe tracks upon which the derrick or crane ran had been laid by the Steel Company and were unballasted. The deceased was ordered by the representatives of the Steel Company to move the derrick along the tracks to a position approximately thirty feet from the trestle or stand upon which the tank was resting, and, having placed the derrick in that position, the deceased was then ordered to shift the tank to the flat car situate some distance behind the derrick.\nThe tackle belonging to the derrick or crane was attached to the tank by the workmen employed by the Steel Company for that purpose, and the deceased was given the signal to hoist. The derrick had lifted the tank about a foot above the trestle, and the boom, with the tank attached, was swinging round towards the flat car behind the derrick, when the derrick fell over on its side, and the deceased, in endeavouring to avoid injury, slipped and was crushed between the corner of the derrick and the ground, and was instantly killed.\nAt the trial counsel for the Superior Company moved for a non-suit on the ground that the deceased was not at the time of the accident in its employ, and that there was no evidence of negligence on its part to submit to the jury. The learned trial judge reserved judgment on the motion, and submitted certain questions to the jury, who returned the answers set out below. Later the trial judge directed judgment in favour of the plaintiff against the Steel Company, but dismissed the action as against the Superior Company. He reached the conclusion that there was no evidence of negligence on which the Superior Company could be held liable. The Steel Company appealed to the Appellate Division, and their appeal was dismissed. The plaintiff appealed against the judgment in favour of the Superior Company, and her appeal was also dismissed.\nThe jury\u2019s findings are as follows:\u2014\n1. Q. Were the defendants, the Lake Superior Paper Company, guilty of any negligence which caused the death of Martin P. Dub\u00e9? A. Yes.\n2. Q. If so, what was that negligence? A. In not furnishing proper equipment, clamps and ballast in deck of crane.\n3. Q. Was the crane, as it was when used by the defendants, the Algoma Steel Corporation, a safe or a dangerous machine at the time when used and as used by the defendants, the Algoma Steel Corporation? A. Yes.\n4. Q. If dangerous, in what respect was it dangerous? A. In not being properly clamped to track or blocked under decking and deck of crane not being properly ballasted.\n5. Q. Were the defendants, the Algoma Steel Company, guilty of negligence which caused the death of Martin P. Dub\u00e9? A. Yes.\n6. Q. If so, what is the negligence which you find? A. In not having a proper rigger to superintend work that wanted to be done.\n7. Q. Could the deceased, Martin P. Dub\u00e9, in the exercise of reasonable care, have avoided the accident? A. No.\n8. Q. If so, what could the deceased have done? A. Nothing more than he did.\nDamages, $3,000.00\u2014if both companies are liable, each company shall pay $1,500.00. If only one company is found liable, that company to pay the full sum of $3,000.00. Anglin K.C. and J.E. Irving for the appellants, the Algoma Steel Corporation. The Steel Company cannot be responsible for injury to an employee of the Paper Company in consequence of the latter\u2019s negligence. Child v. Hearn[2]; Membery v. Great Western Railway Co.[3]; Waldock v. Winfield[4].\nThe Steel Company was not obliged to examine the crane for defects before using it. White v. Steadman[5], Bates v. Batey & Co.[6]\nThe legal effect of the hiring was a warranty that the crane could perform the work safely. Plaintiff representing the owners undertook to work with it, and the Steel Company cannot be liable for the consequences. See Mowbray v. Merryweather[7]; O\u2019Doherty v. Postal Telegraph\u2011Cable Co.[8]\nT.P. Galt and McFadden for the plaintiff appellant and respondent. The Steel Company cannot deny that plaintiff was in their employ within the meaning of the \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation Act,\u201d not having given the notice required by section 14. Wilson v. Owen Sound Portland Cement Co.[9]; Cavanagh v. Park[10].\nBut, apart from the Act, they are liable, having undertaken a hazardous work without a competent person to direct it. Canadian Northern Railway Co. v. Anderson[11]; Heaven v. Pender[12].\nIf the Paper Company is not held liable, the Steel Company should be ordered to pay the costs incurred by joining the former as a defendant. See Besterman v. British Motor Cab Co.[13]\nTilley K.C. and Atkin for the Paper Company, respondents, referred to Donovan v. Laing, Wharton, and Down Construction Syndicate[14]; McCartan v. Belfast Harbour Commissioners[15].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal of the Algoma Steel Company should be dismissed with costs and the cross-appeal of Mrs. Dub\u00e9 allowed as against the Paper Company with costs, for the reasons given by McLellan and Garrow JJ. in the court below and adopted here by my brother Anglin.\nThere is evidence to support the finding that the derrick or crane was dangerous as supplied by the Paper Company, and, because of its defective equipment, the crane toppled over and killed Dub\u00e9. There was also negligence in the management of the crane by the Steel Company, and both companies, by their joint negligence, contributed to the accident.\nIf the crane had been properly equipped, it would not have toppled over, and if proper care had been taken in its management, the consequences of the defective equipment might have been overcome. Therefore, I have come to the conclusion that, on the evidence, the verdict of the jury should be supported.\nMoreover, the relation of master and servant between Dub\u00e9 and the paper company continued to exist up to the time of his death. That company was responsible to him for his wages. It alone could dismiss him and he was subject to its exclusive orders. (Vide Walton Compensation, 38 and 89, Halsbury, vol. 20, p. 191, No. 421; Dalloz, R\u00e9pertoire Pratique, Accidents de Travail, No. 44; (1916) Q.O.R.S.C. p. 219).\nDAVIES J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal of the Algoma Steel Corporation must be dismissed with costs, and the cross-appeal of Mary Dub\u00e9 against both companies, seeking to hold them both liable, should also be dismissed with costs. The result would be that Mary Dub\u00e9 would be entitled to retain her judgment against the Steel Corporation for the full amount of $3,000 awarded as damages by the jury.\nThe accident which happened and which caused the death of Dub\u00e9 was not found by the jury to have happened because of any inherent defects in the crane or its equipment. The proximate and determining cause of the accident was found by them to have been the negligent use by the Steel Company of the crane and its equipment without having any one in charge who was, in fact, competent to direct it. In answer to the question put to them as to the use of the crane by the Steel Company, the jury find that the crane, as it was when used by that company, was a \u201cdangerous machine\u201d in\nnot being properly clamped to the track or blocked under decking and deck of crane not being properly ballasted.\nBut these findings, in themselves, would not have been sufficient to make that company liable. The mere use by the company of a dangerous machine would not be enough unless it was found that such use, owing to the defects of the machine, caused the accident. The next questions asked the jury were:\u2014\n(5) Were the defendants, the Algoma Steel Company, guilty of negligence which caused the death of Martin P. Dub\u00e9? Ans. Yes. Q. If so, what is the negligence you find? Answer fully. Ans. In not having a proper rigger to superintend the work that wanted to be done. The negligence, therefore, found by the jury, and the only negligence found by them, against the Steel Company was the neglect to provide a proper rigger or competent person to direct and control the working of the crane in the condition it was in and for the work required to be done.\nThat it was the duty of the Steel Company to have provided such a rigger or competent person is beyond question, and that they failed in that duty is equally clear. That the duty was one which they owed to the deceased engineer seems to me also under the facts as proved quite clear. I do not find it necessary to determine whether or not Dub\u00e9 was, at the time when working the crane, the servant of the Steel Company. I am strongly inclined to think he was. In any event, they owed a duty towards him, as the engineer of the crane they were working, to provide a competent superintendent to direct his working of the engine with safety. Without such directions he could not work at all. At least, that is my conclusion from the evidence, and I think it was admitted on the argument that Dub\u00e9, in the caboose or cabin or small box in which he was, could not direct or control and did not attempt to direct or control the proper movements of the crane. The absence of proper superintendence by the company ensuring his safety in the discharge of his work was a negligent disregard of the duty they owed him, quite irrespective of whose servant he was. He moved the machinery just as he was ordered by the person in charge to do, and every act in connection with the working of the crane was done according to the orders of the rigger or controller who was directing its working. Under these circumstances, it became the duty of the company operating the crane to provide a proper system for its operation. That person or those persons, for there appeared to be more than one, was, or were, admittedly inexperienced and incompetent, and the jury found that the negligence which caused Dub\u00e9\u2019s death was in the employment of such incompetent persons \u201cto superintend the work that wanted to be done.\u201d\nIt seems to me, therefore, quite clear that the Steel Company failed to discharge the duty they owed to Dub\u00e9 under the circumstances, and that, such failure having been found to be the proximate and determining cause of the accident, they are liable for the full amount of the damages.\nThe jury\u2019s findings against the Paper Company are not such as, under the circumstances, make them jointly liable with the Steel Company. It is true the jury find as against them that they were guilty of negligence \u201cin not furnishing proper equipment clamps and ballast in deck of crane,\u201d and that the crane, in the condition in which they hired it to the Steel Company, and in which it was when the latter used it, was a \u201cdangerous machine.\u201d But they do not find that this faulty equipment or that it being a \u201cdangerous machine\u201d was the immediate and determining cause of the accident. On the contrary, that cause was found to be the neglect of the Steel Company to have the crane used, directed and controlled by a competent manager or rigger.\nIn all respects, therefore, I am in agreement with the judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nI have read the several cases on which the parties respectively rely. But I am fully satisfied that, as was so clearly stated by the Lord Chancellor and the other judges who delivered judgments in the case of McCartan v. Belfast Harbour Commissioners[16], that each case depends upon its own special facts, and that, except where the decisions formulate some legal principle, the decided cases are only useful as illustrations.\nIt must be remembered that in the case at bar Dub\u00e9 was exonerated by the jury from any contributory negligence, and the case was argued on that basis.\nMr. Tilley, for the Paper Company, relied strongly upon the case of Donovan v. Laing, Wharton, and Down Construction Syndicate[17]. That was a case where a person directing the operations of a crane, corresponding with the person who is called throughout this appeal a \u201crigger,\u201d was injured by the negligence of the man in charge of the crane, corresponding to the man Dub\u00e9 in this case. It was the exact reverse of this case, where the man in charge of the crane (Dub\u00e9) was killed through the incompetence of the rigger employed by the Steel Company.\nUnder the special facts of that case, the court held that, as the owner of the crane, when he hired it to another, had parted with the power of controlling the cranesman with regard to the matter on which he was engaged, though the latter still remained his general servant, he was not liable for his negligence.\nIf in this case the negligence of the cranesman, Dub\u00e9, had been a factor, I could see the relevancy of this decision in the Donovan Case17. Under the facts as they exist I do not. The Paper Company are sought to be held liable because of defects in the crane and its equipment. As these have not been found the immediate and determining cause of the accident, I have held that company not liable. The Steel Company I have held liable because they failed in their duty to provide a proper system under which the crane was worked and a proper controller to direct its working, and that the jury found such failure on their part to be the negligence which caused the accident.\nI am also of the opinion that, although under the findings of the jury the Paper Company cannot be held liable, yet that the case as regards the costs of that company comes within the principle of Besterman v. British Motor Cab Co.[18], where it was held that the upholding of an order on an unsuccessful defendant to pay a successful company defendant\u2019s costs depends, in all cases, on whether it was a reasonable and proper course for the plaintiff to have joined both defendants in the action.\nIn this case I think it was a reasonable and proper course to join both defendants, and that the Steel Company, which I hold liable, should pay to the plaintiff all such costs against the Paper Company which, under the judgment to be delivered, she may have to pay or have incurred by reason of the joinder in the action of the Paper Company.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014I think in the circumstances in question herein that the appellant owed to the deceased a legal duty to take care which it failed to discharge, and thereby caused his death.\nI so find quite independently of whether or not there was a legal relationship of master and servant within the meaning of the \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation Act.\u201d\nIn accepting control of, and operating what has been found to have been a dangerous machine, at the time of its so doing, the appellant became bound in law to take due care, in carrying on such operation, that, all such persons as might be lawfully in or about said machine were not endangered thereby or should not suffer from its use.\nInstead of taking such due care, it handed over the direction and management of the operations therewith to those who were not competent, and hence it should abide the consequence.\nThe deceased and another who went with the machine formed, as it were, but parts thereof, and could not have been considered by either of the companies as a fully equipped crew intended to operate the machine.\nI am, therefore, unable to attach that importance to the conversation had between the respective representatives of each company as to the sending clamps along with the machine which appellant\u2019s counsel does and presses so far as to suggest must, when coupled with the fact of and legal effect of a contract of hiring, be held a warranty of the efficiency of the outfit.\nAnything that transpired between the companies cannot, as I view the principles of law applicable, as between the deceased and the appellant, absolve the latter so long as it was the party dominant in controlling the operations of the machine.\nMoreover, when one tries to render it possible to hold these companies jointly liable, we find the very foundation of their relations, which were reduced to writing, is not produced, and at this stage it is impossible to form any very definite conclusion in regard to such relations. All we know is that there was a sort of letting or hiring of something which was not kept by the owners for general public use, but let with such parts, including in that part of a crew, as the parties agreed upon, for which some compensation was to be made. Their agreement to dispense with clamps cannot affect respondents\u2019 rights.\nAnd whether or not she might have had an action against the company in whose service her late husband was engaged can form no concern of the appellant; short of that being an action against the companies jointly and founded on a joint liability which I cannot find in the facts.\nThe common sense of the jury in reaching the verdict first returned of $1,500 against each, if it had been maintained, I suspect might, if the case had been fought out on the lines it indicates as possible, have found some support in law.\nAs the case stands, it is all or nothing so far as appellant is concerned. Its negligence was the last fatal slip of those concerned and the proximate cause of the death of deceased.\nI, therefore, think the appeal must be dismissed with costs, including the costs of all parties and of the cross-appeal against the Lake Superior Company, which, of course, fails.\nThe necessity of keeping the latter company before the court, even by circuitous and cumbrous methods, was fully justified, if we have due regard to the division of opinion in the court below.\nIf the appellant had ever been found, in the course of this litigation, putting forward and acting upon the principles of law I have proceeded upon and discarding and helping the courts to discard the application of the \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation Act,\u201d I could sympathize with its suffering costs.\nBy the other course it has possibly got off with a very much more moderate verdict, than it might have had returned against it from a common law point of view. ANGLIN J.\u2014That the death of the plaintiff\u2019s husband, Dub\u00e9, was caused either by lack of proper equipment of a derrick supplied by the defendant, the Lake Superior Paper Company (hereinafter called the Paper Company), to its co-defendant, the Algoma Steel Corporation (hereinafter called the Steel Corporation), or by the unskilful management, or by a combination of both these causes, scarcely admits of doubt, and was not seriously contested. Nor, contributory negligence on the part of Dub\u00e9 having been negatived by the jury and there being no appeal from that finding, is there much room for doubt as to the liability of one or other, if not of both, of the defendants for the damages assessed at $3,000.\nThe jury has found that the derrick or crane as supplied and used was dangerous, and that its danger consisted\nin (its) not being properly clamped to the track or blocked under decking; deck of crane not being properly ballasted.\nIt would appear that, if properly equipped, the unskilful use of the crane might not have resulted in its collapse; and it would also seem more than probable that, if it had been skilfully used, the lack of proper equipment might have proved harmless. The failure of the Paper Company to furnish proper equipment, the jury finds to have been negligence on its part which caused the death of Dub\u00e9; in failing to provide a competent person to direct the use of the crane the Steel Corporation is found to have been likewise at fault.\nThe Paper Company\u2019s omission to supply clamps, etc., could be chargeable against it as negligence\u2014i.e., breach of duty owing to Dub\u00e9 under the circumstances\u2014only if it should have reasonably anticipated that the derrick would have been put to a use for which this equipment would be required. A finding to that effect is involved in the jury\u2019s answers to the first and second questions; and there is evidence to support such a finding. The controverted issues on this branch of the case are the existence of the duty to Dub\u00e9 by the Paper Company which it is charged with having neglected, and whether its breach was a proximate cause of his death.\nOn the other hand, there is abundant evidence to warrant a finding that a competent supervisor was necessary, and that the omission to provide one (a fact not in dispute) amounted to negligence. Whose negligence is here the vital question.\nIn order to have a true conception of the duty owing by each of the defendants to Dub\u00e9, it is essential to ascertain the relation in which he stood to each of them. There is no suggestion that the Paper Company had undertaken the removal of the Steel Corporation\u2019s disused alkali plant as independent contractors. They supplied the Steel Corporation, for a consideration, with the means to effect such removal. They were bailors, and the Steel Corporation bailees, of the derrick. But, upon a consideration of the authorities, I concur in the view of the four judges of the Appellate Division, who held that under the circumstances in evidence Dub\u00e9 was throughout the servant of the Paper Company. The case, in my opinion, falls within the principle of the decisions in Quarman v. Burnett[19]; Jones v. Corporation of Liverpool[20]; Moore v. Palmer[21]; Union S.S. Co. v. Claridge[22]; McCartan v. Belfast Harbour Commissioners[23]; Consolidated Plate Glass Co. v. Caston[24]; and Waldock v. Winfield[25]. The absence of control of Dub\u00e9 by the Steel Corporation, while performing his duties as \u201crunner\u201d of the crane, and of the right to dismiss him and substitute someone else for him, distinguishes this case from Donovan v. Laing, Wharton, and Down Construction Syndicate[26], Rourke v. White Moss Colliery Co.[27], and other cases relied on by the Paper Company. The Steel Corporation\u2019s right of interference and the control exercised by it was no greater than that of the shipowner in McCartan v. Belfast Harbour Commissioners[28].\nIn my opinion, as its servant engaged in doing work for its profit which his contract with it obliged him to perform, Dub\u00e9 was entitled to expect that his employer, the Paper Company, would not send him out with a machine so defectively equipped that its use in the work which was contemplated when it was hired would be dangerous unless that danger should be overcome or obviated by the exercise of care and skill by a person not supplied by the Paper Company. Assuming that, as between the defendants, it was the contractual duty of the Steel Corporation to have provided a competent \u201crigger\u201d as between itself and its employee, I think the Paper Company cannot invoke the failure of its co-defendants to provide such a rigger, whose skill and vigilance, if exercised, might have saved the employee from the consequences of his employers\u2019 own negligence in sending him out to perform work for which the crane supplied by it was so inadequately equipped that its use was dangerous. Whatever rights (if any) the Paper Company may have against the Steel Corporation because of the absence of a competent rigger, that fact, in my opinion, does not afford a defence to it as against the plaintiff. I also agree with Garrow and Maclaren JJ.A. that there is evidence to support the finding that the negligence of the Paper Company was a proximate cause of the collapse of the crane, and I incline to think that the plaintiff is entitled to recover against this defendant under the \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation Act\u201d as well as at common law, although, but for the existence of the relation of master and servant, unless the Paper Company was under contractual obligation to its co\u2011defendant to furnish a \u201crigger,\u201d it would probably not be liable at all under the doctrine enunciated in such cases as O\u2019Neil v. Everest[29], in 1892. Dub\u00e9 was killed in the course of his employment, while, and in consequence of, acting in obedience to a negligent order of a person in the employment of the Paper Company, to whose orders he was bound to conform. He was killed owing to defects in machinery negligently supplied to him by his employer for the work he was sent to do. The fact that, although the collapse of the derrick was a natural consequence of the Paper Company\u2019s negligence, that negligence became operative because its effect was not counteracted by competent supervision (though the duty to provide that supervision rested on its co-defendant) does not suffice to prevent the Paper Company\u2019s negligence being truly a cause and not merely a condition of that collapse happening. Paterson v. The Mayor of Blackburn[30]; Reg. v. Haines[31]; Engelhart v. Farrant & Co.[32], at pp. 246-7, per Rigby L.J.; Burrows v. March Gas and Coke Co.[33] The plaintiffs case against the Steel Corporation is perhaps not quite so clear. Dub\u00e9 was not its servant. The highest degree of care that it owed him was that which is due to an invitee or licensee. It may be that, as between the Steel Corporation and the Paper Company, the latter is under an obligation arising out of warranty which may entitle the Steel Corporation to indemnification. That question is not before us, and I express no opinion upon it. The existence of such a warranty would afford no answer to a claim by the plaintiff for breach of a duty owing to her deceased husband. Nor does the fact that Dub\u00e9 was the servant of the Paper Company affect the liability of the Steel Corporation if it was under a duty to supply a competent rigger as the jury has found. Upon the evidence there is some uncertainty as to whether the order of the Steel Company was for \u201ca derrick and crew,\u201d by which might well be understood a body of men in number and qualification sufficient to control and operate the derrick, or was for \u201ca locomotive crane with engineer and fireman,\u201d as its pleading avers. The written order is not in evidence. Counsel for the Paper Company at the trial made this statement:\u2014\nThe Paper Company owned the crane and employed Mr. Dub\u00e9 as the engineer to run it and McLaughlin as the fireman to fire it. They then hired it with its crew to the Algoma Steel Corporation.\nIn his factum counsel for the Paper Company speaks of the Steel Corporation \u201chaving hired a derrick with its crew of two men only.\u201d The evidence makes it reasonably clear that, in addition to the \u201crunner\u201d and the fireman, the crew of a derrick such as that in question should include a competent man known as a \u201crigger\u201d to supervise the \u201cspotting\u201d of it and the management of the work to be done. The failure to provide such a man was certainly negligence on the part of one or other of the defendants. Inasmuch as the jury has attributed that negligence to the Steel Corporation and not to the Paper Company, it would seem probable that, in its opinion, the contract between these two companies required the Paper Company to furnish only the runner and fireman, leaving the obligation upon the Steel Corporation, which was to order the derrick to be put in operation, to furnish the necessary supervisor. If that be the correct view of the case, and I think it is a fair inference from the jury\u2019s findings, which cannot upon the evidence be held to be clearly erroneous, the liability of the Steel Corporation would also seem to be clear. It could not be heard to urge \u201cidentification\u201d of Dub\u00e9 with his employer, the Paper Company, as a defence (see Child v. Hearn[34]; Membery v. Great Western Railway Company[35]); indeed, it would itself be liable to the Paper Company for any damages sustained by it in consequence of the breach of the implied undertaking to provide a rigger competent to handle the derrick with reasonable care and skill.\nBut, whatever may have been the duty in this respect of the two companies inter se, I rather incline to think that the necessity for having a competent rigger in charge was so clear that, as to any person likely to be injured through just such an accident as that which happened, whether one of its own employees, a mere stranger lawfully on the premises, or an employee of the bailor, the Steel Corporation, before directing that the derrick should be put into operation, was under an obligation to see that it was in charge of such a rigger. Attempting the removal of such a heavy article as a tank weighing 8,700 pounds without a competent rigger verges very close upon, if it does not amount to, recklessness, such as would entail liability to a mere licensee or invitee.\nWhen the derrick was placed or \u201cspotted\u201d in order to remove the tank, in the carrying of which it collapsed, it was found that, as then adjusted, the arm of the crane would not reach it. Instead of moving the derrick closer, as the evidence shews might easily have been done, one Jeffrey, an employee of the Steel Corporation, directed Dub\u00e9 to lower the arm of the crane. This had the effect of increasing the distance between the derrick and the end of the arm, thus augmenting the leverage, which proved to be too great when the load was swung out. This was the immediate cause of the collapse. A competent rigger would, in all probability, have either insisted upon the derrick being placed nearer or being secured by clamps or by blocking up the platform before attempting to move this heavy tank with the arm extended practically to its extreme length. It may be that, as against the Paper Company, the Steel Corporation was warranted in assuming that the operation could be fully performed just as it was attempted. But I gravely doubt that it would have been justified in making such an assumption as against any person\u2014even a servant of the Paper Company\u2014whose personal safety was thus jeopardized. In view of the jury\u2019s findings, however, it seems to be unnecessary to determine this question.\nI am, for these reasons, of the opinion that the verdict against the Steel Corporation must stand. The negligence of both defendants having materially contributed to causing the unfortunate Dub\u00e9\u2019s death, each is liable for the total result of their joint wrong, and, whatever may be their rights of indemnity inter se, neither can ask to have the damages apportioned as against the plaintiff. The main appeal should be dis- missed and the cross-appeal allowed, and the plaintiff should have judgment for $3,000 against both defendants, with costs throughout.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014In hiring their crane to the Algoma Steel Company, the Lake Superior Paper Company should have furnished a proper equipment, clamps and ballast, to raise the five or six tons of weight that were mentioned. But they have not done so, and, as a result of that defective equipment, the accident in question has happened to their servant Dub\u00e9.\nThe jury has found that they were negligent. There was evidence to justify such a verdict, but the courts below have not, however, accepted it.\nThat is not a question of law that was being raised on that issue between the Paper Company and the relatives of the victim, but it was a question of fact of which the jury was the judge. (McCartan v. Belfast Harbour Commissioners[36]).\nOf course, if there had been no evidence to justify the verdict, the latter should be set aside. But there was sufficient evidence to justify it, and it should be maintained.\nThe appeal of Mary Dub\u00e9 against the Lake Superior Paper Company should then be allowed.\nAs far as the Algoma Steel Company is concerned, the jury found also that the latter company was guilty of negligence in not having a competent foreman to superintend the work that had to be done.\nThat verdict was approved by the courts below and should be maintained.\nThe judgment should be that the defendant companies are condemned to pay, jointly and severally, the sum of $3,000, of which $1,250 to the plaintiff, Mary Dub\u00e9, and the balance distributed in equal shares to the six children of the victim. The defendant companies should pay the costs throughout.\nAppeal by the Algoma Steel Corporation dismissed with costs.\nAppeal by Dub\u00e9 allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants, the Algoma Steel Corporation: J. Ewart Irving.\nSolicitors for the respondent, Mary Dub\u00e9: McFadden & McMillan.\nSolicitors for the respondents, the Lake Superior Paper Company: Hearst, Rowland & Atkin.\n[1] 35 Ont.

Acts, 1888, ch. 111, sec. 92), provides that the owner shall have the right to redeem land sold \"at any time within two years from the date of the tax sale or before delivery of the conveyance to the purchaser at the tax sale.\" The tax sale deed in question was dated on the day before the expiration of two years from the date of the tax sale. The B.C. \"Assessment Act, 1903,\" 3 & 4 Edw. VII., ch. 53, secs. 125, 153 and 156, declares that all proceedings which may have been heretofore taken for the recovery of delinquent taxes under any Act of the province, by public sale or otherwise, should be valid and of full force and effect; that tax sale deeds should be conclusive evidence of the validity of all proceedings in the sale up to the execution of such deed, and that such sale and the official deed to the purchaser of any such lands shall be final and binding upon the former owners of the said lands and upon all persons claiming by, through or under them.\nHeld, per Fitzpatrick C.J. and Idington and Anglin JJ. (reversing the judgment appealed from (9 West. W.R. 440; 24 D.L.R. 851), Davies and Brodeur JJ. dissenting, that, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, it must be presumed that the delivery of the conveyance to the tax sale purchaser took place on the date of the tax sale deed; that the execution and delivery thereof were premature, and, therefore, the conveyance was ineffectual and insufficient to justify the issue of a certificate of title under the provisions of the \"Land Registry Act\" or of the \"Torrens Registry Act, 1899\", nor could the curative clauses of sections 125, 153 and 156 of the \"Assessment Act, 1903\" be applied so as to have the effect of validating the void conveyance.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] , affirming the judgment of Clement J. at the trial, by which the plaintiffs' action was dismissed with costs.\nThe plaintiffs brought the action, as beneficiaries under the will of the late Robert Heron, deceased, for a declaration that certain lands in the City of Vancouver, B.C., had been unlawfully and wrongfully sold at a tax sale of lands for delinquent taxes by the assessor of the District of New Westminster, on the 22nd of July, 1896, and subsequently, for a second time, by the assessor for the District of Vancouver, on the 9th of December, 1903; and for a decree setting aside the said tax sales and all deeds, etc., subsequent thereto. The circumstances of the case are stated in the judgments now reported.\nW. N. Tilley K.C. for the appellants.\nJames A. Harvey K.C. for the respondents.\nThe CHIEF JUSTICE concurred with IDINGTON J.\nDAVIES J. (dissenting).\u2014The appeal in this case is absolutely without any intrinsic merits and if succesful may cause very grave injustice to bon\u00e2 fide purchasers of land in British Columbia.\nI am glad to find myself fully in accord with the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia confirming the judgment of the trial Judge, Clement J. The questions relied upon in this court were that the tax deed in question was dated the 22nd July, 1898, that the time for the owner to redeem did not expire till the end of that day, and, although there was no evidence whatever of any delivery of the deed on the day it is dated, it must be presumed to have been delivered on that day.\nThe other point attempted to be raised in this court as to the jurisdiction of the assessor, E. L. Kirkland, to hold and conduct the tax sale in question was not raised in the Court of Appeal, and was, in fact, abandoned before that court. The affidavit of Mr. McCrossen who was counsel in the court of first instance for the defendant respondents and also in the Court of Appeal makes this quite clear. He not only states that the question of the tax sale deed having been executed, as counsel for appellant alleged, a day too soon \"was the only point argued by Mr. Martin,\" but that\nat the conclusion of his argument the learned Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia expressly asked Mr. Martin if that was the only point in the case and Mr. Martin replied that it was the only point in the case.\nThe judgment of the learned Chief Justice, who spoke for the whole court, expressly shews that only one point was there raised and that was the one arising out of the date of the deed.\nNo affidavit to the contrary was made on behalf of the appellant and I cannot but think that to allow a point abandoned in the Court of Appeal to be raised in this court would be contrary to our usual practice and would be an injustice to the respondent. In such a case as this, where the appellant has no merits whatever and is relying upon mere technical objections, I do not think he should be heard on the abandoned point. If the majority think otherwise then I say that I agree with the judgment of my brother Brodeur, which I have had an opportunity of reading, that the objection to the jurisdiction of Kirkland is without foundation.\nThe other point was that the presumption from the date of the deed necessarily must be the date of its delivery; I decline to accept it. It should not have been in strictness delivered till the morning of the 23rd. If the appellant had tendered his taxes on the 22nd no such delivery on the 23rd or afterwards would have taken place.\nI would think the proper presumption to draw from all the facts proved is that legal delivery did not take place till after the 22nd had expired in which case, of course, the claim of the plaintiff entirely fails.\nI take it as a general presumption of law illustrating the maxim omnia proesumuntur rite et solennitur esse acta that a man acting in a public capacity should, in the absence of proof to the contrary, have credit given to him for having done so with honesty and discretion. See judgment in Earl Derby v. Bury Improvement Commissioners[2].\nThe proper presumption to be drawn under the facts as proved in this case is, in my opinion, that the tax commissioners, having a number of sales to complete, for convenience had the deeds prepared on the day of the expiry of the redemption period after the sale and dated on that day, but knowing that the tax defaulters had the whole of that day in which to redeem, did not deliver this deed in question to the purchaser until the next day. To presume that he acted contrary to law and in violation of his duty I cannot do in the state of the evidence. But, if I am wrong on this question of the proper presumption to be drawn from the date of the deed, then I am in full accord with the judgment appealed from and with the reasons in support of it of my brother Brodeur and those of Chief Justice Macdonald in the Court of Appeal.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014I am unable to understand how a bare power given by statute to do anything, only to be exercised by a designated statutory officer within a specified time, and upon certain conditions precedent, can be said to have produced anything effective in law when attempted to be exercised at another time than specified without the conditions precedent having been fulfilled and by another statutory officer than the one designated and having no power in the premises.\nMuch less can I see how, when the instrument to be produced is a deed, it can when made under such circumstances be called one.\nCan the forger if he succeed in getting a specimen of his fine art, wearing the semblance of a tax deed, upon record, by the complaisant negligence of him put on guard as registrar, divest any man of his estate?\nThe condition precedent to the registrar's authority validating anything is the production to him duly attested of a tax sale deed. How can he validate the forgery? How can he validate that which when it came to him was of no higher legal value than a forgery?\nAnd the appeal to the following curative section in the \"Taxation Act\":\u2014\nA tax sale deed shall, in any proceedings in any court in this province, and for the purpose of the' Land Registry Act\" and the \"Torrens Registry Act, 1899\", except as herein provided, be conclusive evidence of the validity of the assessment of the land and levy of the rate, the sale of land for taxes, and all other proceedings leading up to the execution of such deed, and notwithstanding any defect in such assessment, levy, sale or other proceedings, no such tax deed shall be annulled, or set aside, except upon the following grounds and no others,\ndoes not help further than to substitute the effect of its language for the conditions precedent to the due execution of the power.\nIts plain language only touches that which precedes the deed.\nIt assumes a deed otherwise pursuant to the power to have been executed and by one competent to execute it.\nThe contention that the point involved in the question of the status of the officer executing the deed was abandoned below does not appear to be well founded.\nThe case of Osborne v. Morgan[3], relied upon by the learned Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal, does not seem to me in point.\nThat was a case where the Crown had an interest in the land and had recognized rights in those given by the executive. The court above merely denied the right of him suing to question in his action that granted and recognized by competent authority.\nThis is a case, I repeat, of bare power to an officer to do a certain act and nothing more and the question asked whether in law he did so or not\u2014clearly, to my mind, he did not, and I doubt very much on his own evidence if the one who attempted it was the officer who could have executed it.\nThe appeal being successful as to the first deed renders consideration of the later sale unnecessary further than to say that the assessor was clearly in error in such a view of appellants' right in refusing to permit any one to redeem unless under the title supposed to have been acquired by virtue of the first sale.\nThe appeal should be allowed but, I think, without costs throughout. The contention for abandonment is unfounded so far as the legal rights of the parties are concerned.\nThere was nothing done to estop the appellants or their predecessors but there was such an approach to laches as entitles us properly to refuse costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The respondent's title to the land in question depends upon the validity of an alleged tax sale deed and a certificate of \"absolute title\" issued under the British Columbia \"Land Registry Act,\" 1906, ch. 23.\nThat the taxes for which the land was sold were in arrear and that the sale was fair and open, though conducted by an official not authorized, are facts not now disputed. But it is admitted that the tax sale deed bears date one day before the expiry of two years from the date of the tax sale\u2014the statute allows the deed to be made only after that period has elapsed\u2014 and it has been proved that the person who executed it was not the assessor for the County of Vancouver in which the land was situated, but the assessor for the County of Westminster who had no authority or jurisdiction whatever in the matter.\nIt is contended that because there is no positive evidence of when the deed was actually delivered it should be presumed that it was delivered in conformity with the statute. But the officer who executed and delivered it was called as a witness and, although the issue as to the date of delivery was distinctly raised on the pleadings, he did not say a word to suggest that delivery was not made on the day on which the deed bears date. Under these circumstances the ordinary presumption that the deed was delivered on the day of its date must prevail. Sheppard, Touch. 72; Stone v. Grubbam (1614)[4]. The matter is of substance because\nthe right of redemption subsists until delivery of the conveyance to the purchaser at the tax sale.\nIt was argued that the deed should be deemed merely irregular and voidable because this objection to its validity could have been cured by re-delivery after the expiry of two years. But in that case it would operate as a new deed then delivered and not at all by virtue of any efficacy which it had previously possessed. Moreover, there is no suggestion that there was in fact any such re-delivery before tender of the redemption money. For these reasons I think this objection to the validity of the deed must prevail.\nThe objection based on the fact that the wrong assessor had executed the deed is in my opinion even more clearly fatal to its validity. It was mere waste paper.\nCounsel for the respondent maintained that this objection had been abandoned in the court below, and he supported this contention by an affidavit not altogether satisfactory. Counsel for the appellants read a telegram from the counsel who had represented them in the provincial courts denying that there had been any such concession. The point is not noticed in the judgments below. If the appellants' success should be dependent upon this ground of appeal, while they would not be precluded from urging it, since the authority of the assessor who executed the deed is expressly challenged in the statement of claim and there is no controversy as to the facts, a question of costs might arise. McKelvey v. Le Roi Mining Co.[5], and see cases in Snow's Annual Practice, 1916, at page 1111. The appellants' success on the point as to date of delivery renders it unnecessary further to consider this aspect of the matter.\nTo meet these difficulties the respondent invokes three curative statutory provisions, sections 125, 153 and 156 of the British Columbia \"Taxation Act\" of 1903-4, ch. 53.\nThe first of these sections declares valid and of full force and effect\nall proceedings which may have been taken for the recovery\nof taxes unpaid on the 31st December, 1902,\nunder any Act of this province heretofore in force, by public sale or otherwise.\nThe void tax sale deed was not, in my opinion,\na proceeding for the recovery of taxes under any Act of the province\nwhich this provision would validate.\nSection 153 provides that a tax sale deed shall be conclusive evidence of the validity of all proceedings in the sale \"up to the execution of such deed.\" It is obvious that this provision is predicated upon the existence of a tax sale deed. Its curative effect is expressly limited to proceedings anterior to the execution of the deed. It certainly does not constitute a mere piece of waste paper a valid tax sale deed.\nUnder section 156, if the tax for which the land has been sold was due and it has not been redeemed within the period allowed for redemption,\nsuch sale and the official deed shall be final and binding upon the former owners of the said lands and upon all persons claiming by, through or under them. The facts that the time for redemption does not expire until the delivery of the tax sale deed, i.e., a valid and effectual deed, and that the existence of the official deed, likewise a valid and effectual deed, is a pre-requisite to the operation of this section, render it inapplicable to the case at bar.\nNo curative section has been brought to my notice which vests title in the tax purchaser or deprives the owner of his right of redemption where no tax sale deed which can be recognized as such has been executed or delivered.\nThe defendant also relies upon the provisions of the \"Land Registry Act\" of British Columbia, 1906, ch. 23. A certificate of title under that statute confers on the holder merely a prim\u00e2 facie title: Howard v. Miller[6], decided in this court on the 28th May, 1913. By section 31, in case of an application for registration by a purchaser of land at a tax sale, the registrar is empowered, after notice to the persons appearing upon the assessment roll to be interested in the land and in default of opposition by any of them, to register such purchaser as owner of the land. By section 32 he is authorized to direct substitutional service of such notice\nwhere it is made to appear to (him) that the notice mentioned in the last preceding section cannot be personally served or cannot be personally served without undue expense.\nThe owner in this case resided in Victoria, where assessment and other notices had been sent to him, as appears by the evidence. An order was made by the registrar for substitutional service upon him, in common with a number of other owners of property sold for taxes, by advertisement and by mailing a notice addressed to him at Vancouver. This order was made apparently without any material. The only affidavit produced, made by one Hartley, was sworn several days after the last insertion of the advertisement, and states, as to some twenty-three property owners, that in the opinion of the deponent \"it would entail considerable expense to serve all the above parties personally.\" The registrar, when examined as a witness at the trial, said that he had no personal recollection of the matter or why he had made the order for substitutional service; that it was his practice to do so; that from the papers in the registry office, including Hartley's affidavit, he assumes he made an order for service in this way; that the statute is very broad and wide and he understood authorized a general order for substitutional service without considering the case or position of each particular individual involved. It is fairly obvious that no inquiry was made as to the whereabouts or residence of the registered owner of the lots now in question and that it was not \"made to appear to the registrar\" that he could not be personally served or could not be so served without undue expense.\nMoreover, the notice mailed to the owner at Vancouver was returned to the registrar through the post office undelivered, yet no steps appear to have been taken under sub-section 3 of section 32 which provides that\non the return of any letter containing any notice the registrar shall act in the matter requiring such notice to be given in such manner as he shall think fit.\nIn my opinion the order for substitutional service was clearly made without jurisdiction, with the result that registration of the purchaser as owner under section 31 was made without the notice required by that section and was therefore ineffectual and the certificate of absolute title issued to the defendant Lalonde claiming under him is invalid. The defendant finally set up abandonment and acquiescence as an answer to the plaintiff's claim. The circumstances would probably not warrant a defence on the ground of laches being made to an equitable claim. The plaintiffs are asserting a legal right which no mere lapse of time short of the period fixed by the statute of limitations would extinguish.\nI do not find in the circumstances anything amounting to a representation by the plaintiffs or their testator to persons dealing with the property that they would not assert their right to it, followed by action and on the part of the latter of such a nature that an estoppel would arise against any subsequent assertion of their rights by the former. Anderson v. Municipality of South Vancouver[7], at pages 446 et seq., and 462.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the Court of Appeal and the plaintiffs should have judgment for the recovery of the land with costs of the action. If the relief of an accounting and the claim for damages are insisted upon they are entitled to a reference to the proper officer of the Supreme Court of British Columbia to have those matters dealt with, the costs of which should be reserved to be disposed of in the Supreme Court of British Columbia according to its usual practice.\nBRODEUR J. (dissenting).\u2014The question that arises in this case is whether the plaintiffs may redeem some lands sold for taxes. Robert Heron, the former owner of those lands, never paid any taxes on them from 1893, the date he got them from the Crown, until they were sold for taxes on the 22nd of July, 1896. Those lands were in the assessment district then known as the New Westminster District and the assessor and collector for that district was Mr. E. L. Kirkland.\nIn 1895, the New Westminster District seems to have been divided in two, one was called the Vancouver District, for which Mr. Bryne was appointed assessor and collector, and the other was called the Westminster District, with Mr. Kirkland as assessor and collector.\nThe lands in question being in the City of Vancouver they became part of the Vancouver District.\nThere is nothing in the Official Gazette, the only document we have on the matter, shewing that the power of the collector for the old \"New Westminster District\" to collect moneys for arrears of taxes was cancelled.\nIn 1896, on the 22nd of July, Mr. Kirkland proceeded to sell those lands for the payment of those arrears and, on the 22nd of July, 1898, he made a deed in favour of the person who had bought the property at the public tax sale.\nIt is now claimed on this appeal that Mr. Kirkland had not the power to sell the lands in question and to execute that deed.\nThere is no doubt that he was the assessor and the collector of the New Westminster District and that as such he could assess the lots in question and levy taxes thereon. We have no evidence that his powers with regard to the collection of overdue taxes were cancelled in 1895 as claimed by the appellant.\nThat point was not formally raised by the statement of claim. It is true that some evidence was given which might have some effect on that point but it was not complete and it does not show that Mr. Kirkland's authority over the taxes then due was at an end by the division of the district.\nI do not see that the point was dealt with in the notes by the judges of the courts below and we have an affidavit shewing that it was never mentioned in the Court of Appeal.\nI consider that the evidence which we have before us does not shew that Mr. Kirkland had no power to deal with the collection of the taxes and the sale of the lands upon which they were imposed and that, in these circumstances, the point raised by the appellants in that regard should not be entertained. I may add that the provisions of the \"Assessment Act\" (ch. 179 of 1897) and particularly sections 27, 78, 81, 87, 92, 94, 96, 116 and 119 give to the assessor who has assessed the property the right to collect the taxes thereby imposed.\nFrom 1896, the date of the tax sale, until 1904, the date of his death, Mr. Robert Heron does not seem to have taken any steps to redeem the property. The evidence does not shew either whether he made inquiries with regard to the payment of taxes or the redemption of the property.\nIn 1904, after his death, his executor, Mr. Brown, found some papers concerning those lands and made inquiries with regard to them. Having found, however, that they had been sold for taxes, he did not exercise any right of redemption which he might have.\nThe property was once more sold in 1906 for taxes. From that date until 1913 no steps have been taken by the Heron estate, the appellants, with regard to that property; but the lands having increased in value they instituted the present action.\nThere is no doubt as to the validity of the second tax sale. There is no question either with regard to the validity of the first tax sale; but they claim that their right of redemption under the first tax sale still exists because the deed was executed a day before the date at which it should have been made.\nUnder the \"Assessment Act\" of British Columbia the owner of land sold for taxes may\nat any time within two years from the date of this tax sale or before the delivery of the conveyance of the tax sale\nredeem the estate sold.\nThe appellants claim that they are still within the time for exercising that right because there has never been delivery of any legal conveyance to the purchaser.\nWas the tax deed void or voidable? If it is an absolute nullity, then no delivery of conveyance has taken place.\nThe actual execution of the deed could have been performed at any time after the 22nd July. A new deed could have been executed the very next day and no question could be raised with regard to its validity. If the money had been tendered on or before the 22nd July, 1898, the rights of the appellants could not be denied and the execution of the deed on that date, could not have been invoked against them. But no such tender was made and the deed which has been prematurely executed could not be, in my opinion, considered as a nullity. It was simply voidable and now that the deed has its full effect, that it was formally delivered to the purchaser, it seems to me that the right of redemption which the owner of the land possessed has expired. The purchaser's right has become absolute.\nBesides, I agree with the learned trial judge that the provisions of section 255 of chapter 222, Revised Statutes of British Columbia, 1911, have cured any defects which might have occurred in connection with this tax sale. The section says:\u2014\nA tax sale deed shall, in any proceedings in any court in this province, and for the purposes of the \"Land Registry Act\", except as hereinafter provided, be conclusive evidence of the validity of the assessment of the land and levy of the rate, the sale of the land for taxes, and all other proceedings leading up to the execution of such deed; and, notwithstanding any defect in such assessment, levy, sale, or other proceedings, no such tax deed shall be annulled or set aside, except upon the following grounds and no other:\u2014\n(a) That the sale was not conducted in a fair and open manner;\n(b) That the taxes for the year or years for which the land was sold had been paid; or\n(c) That the land was not liable to taxation for the year or years for which it was sold.\nIt is true these curative sections should not be construed in too liberal a way but the statute is drafted in such terms and such language that a deed which has been executed, like the present one, would preclude the appellants from claiming seventeen years after the sale has taken place the right to redeem the property.\nFor these reasons, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed without costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Martin, Craig & Parkes.\nSolicitors for the respondents: McCrossan & Harper.\n[1] 9 West.

Brodeur J. dissented. Idington J. dissented on the ground that such intention was not clearly manifested.\nThe partnership articles provided that at the end of each partnership year an account should be taken of the stock, liabilities and assets of the business and a balance sheet struck for that year; that in case one partner died the co-partnership should continue to the end of the current financial year or, at the option of the survivor, for not more than twelve months from such death; that for twelve months from the death of his partner the survivor should not be required to pay over any part of the latter\u2019s capital in the business; and that any dispute between the survivor and representatives of the deceased as to the amount of debits against or credits to either in the balance sheet or the valuation of the assets should be referred to arbitration.\nHeld, Duff J. dissenting, that the value of the interest of the deceased partner was not to be determined by the account taken and balance sheet struck at the end of the financial year following his death, but the assets should be valued in the ordinary way.\nHeld, also, Davies and Duff JJ. dissenting, that the goodwill of the business was to be included in said assets, though it had never formed a part of them in the annual balance sheets struck since the co-partnership began.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division (34 Ont. L.R. 278) reversed in part. APPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], varying the decision on the hearing on an originating notice.\nThe facts on which the questions of law for decision depend are sufficiently stated in the above head-note.\nTilley K.C. and Washington K.C. for the appellant.\nE.F.B. Johnston K.C. for the respondents.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I agree with the conclusions reached by Mr. Justice Middleton who heard this case in the first instance and am not able to agree with the First Appellate Division in the variations made by them in those conclusions.\nThe reasons given by Mr. Justice Middleton are quite satisfactory to me and I do not think I could hope to state them more clearly than he has done. I therefore concur in his judgment and in his reasons for the same.\nIn agreeing with his conclusion that the good will of the business is not to be taken into account in ascertaining the amount to be paid by Wood to the executors of Vallance, I am influenced largely by the decision reached in Steuart v. Gladstone[2] in 1879 That case was decided by a very strong Court of Appeal, Jessel M.R. and James and Bramwell, L.JJ. Of course the facts are not identical with those of the case before us, but reading the observations made by these learned judges in giving their judgments and applying the principle on which they acted to the facts of the case before us, I am forced to the conclu- sion that it never was intended by the parties to this partnership that in the event which has happened of the death of one of the partners during the term of 5 years for which the partnership was entered into, and the purchase by the surviving partner of his deceased partner\u2019s interest the intangible and uncertain asset called good will should be valued and paid for.\nThe articles of partnership are not only silent with respect to good will, but the balance sheets of the partnership business and assets made during the years 1911-12 and 1913, when both partners were alive, do not include anything of the kind. In these balance sheets the partners gave their own meaning to the word \u201ccapital\u201d as used in the partnership articles. \u201cCapital\u201d was the balancing item. It was the difference between the total assets and the total liabilities. The share of each partner in the net assets was shewn by that balancing item. Construing the somewhat ambiguous language of these partnership articles in the light of the very short term of five years during which the partnership was to last and all the other facts and the conduct of both partners I conclude on the authority of the case referred to that good will should not be included in ascertaining the amount which the surviving partner should pay.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014The rule 605 of the Consolidated Rules of Practice in Ontario, upon which the proceedings herein in question are founded, reads:\u2014\n605. (1) Where the rights of the parties depend\u2014\n(a) Upon the construction of any contract or agreement and there are no material facts in dispute;\n(b) Upon undisputed facts and the proper inference from such facts;\nSuch rights may be determined upon originating notice. (2) A contract or agreement may be construed before there has been a breach thereof. (New).\nRegard, however, may have to be had to the Rules Nos. 604 and 606 in case the proceedings, taken under the Rule 605, just quoted, give rise to the application of either or both.\nI cannot find within the scope of the questions submitted and the admitted facts relevant thereto, any clear warrant for the court making such declarations as are to be found in the 2nd sub-section of clause No. 2 of the formal judgment appealed from. It seems to pass upon a question that is not presented in the submission.\nIt may well be that the parties when before that court desired its opinion on the question involved in the answer made. At present I see no reason why they might not have been well advised in thus enlarging the scope of the submission, if they did so, but for us having to pass thereon or pass it by, when no record is made of the fact, is, to say the least embarrassing.\nAs a step in the reasoning involved in the construction of the document I can also understand the application of the proposition involved in the declaration, but am unable in that case to see why it should form part of the answers to the submission.\nThere is nothing in the opinion judgment explaining how it comes to be dealt with except as having been argued before that court; or in the factum of either party dealing with this adjudication. I think we must, under such circumstances, rigidly observe the questions submitted and the undisputed facts and inferences from such facts and answer accordingly. I, therefore, express no opinion relative to this matter seeming to me beyond such questions.\nBy the notice of motion the following are the questions upon which the advice and order of the court are desired.\n1. Whether William Augustus Wood, surviving partner of Wood, Vallance & Co., is entitled to take over the interest of the William Vallance Estate in the said co-partnership assets by paying to his estate the amount of his capital with interest and profits.\n2. Whether the goodwill of the business of Wood, Vallance & Co. enures to the benefit of the estate of the said William Vallance, as well as to the surviving partner, the said William A. Wood.\n3. Whether on a valuation of the assets of Wood, Vallance & Co. the value appearing in the balance sheet of 31st January, 1913, is binding on the executors of William Vallance, or whether the actual value of such assets is to be ascertained.\nTo answer correctly these questions we must consider the articles of partnership, which are admitted, and so far as ambiguous must have regard to the undisputed surrounding facts and circumstances, and if any assistance to be gained thereby also the conduct of the parties immediately after the time when the said articles became operative.\nWilliam A. Wood, the appellant, and William Vallance, who died on the 28th November, 1913, had been members of an old firm composed of themselves and the late George Vallance and George Denman Wood, carrying on a hardware business in Hamilton, under the name of Wood, Vallance & Co.\nOn the 31st January, 1910, said appellant and the late William Vallance agreed to enter into co-partnership for the purpose of continuing the said business and bound themselves by articles of partnership to do so for five years from that date.\nBy the said articles they agreed to take over and assume all the liabilities of the said firm and transfer to the new firm all their respective interests in the old firm. I assume, as seems throughout to have been assumed, that there were other transfers got from those representing the other members of the old firm, and the title completed as is implied in what is submitted herein.\nThe parties then by said articles declare they are respectively interested in the capital and assets as follows: That is to say, Wood to the extent of $577,524 and Vallance to the extent of $479,243.\nClause No. 5 provided for interest on capital of each partner being allowed at 6% per annum and that being paid or credited to him at the end of each succeeding year.\nClause No. 6 provided after payment of such interest that the profits should be apportioned equally.\nClause No. 7 that each should devote his time and attention to the business in the manner specified.\nClause No. 8 is as follows:\u2014\n8. At the expiration of each succeeding year of the partnership an account shall be taken of the stock-in-trade, assets and liabilities of the partnership, and an annual balance sheet shall then be made out to the thirty-first day of January in each year, which shall be attested by each of the parties hereto.\nIt is upon this clause and what followed it in way of its observance that the answer to the third question must turn. There were statements made out each year which were probably intended to comply, so far as they went, with the terms of this clause, but none of them were signed by either partner.\nThe form of attesting is not provided for. I assume a signing or other deliberate act of approval such as could reasonably be said to fall within the word \u201cattest\u201d as used in such connection should be held sufficient. The mere tacit assent cannot be held as a compliance with the peculiar terms of this clause.\nThe existence of the statement and the fact that each partner was engaged actively in the business, and says nothing in way of objecting thereto, is very cogent evidence of assent, but falls short of what is expressly demanded. No one can ever be quite sure what the partner, so acting and refraining from acting, had in his mind. He may have desired to avoid needlessly doing anything to provoke a quarrel; or he may have been so anxiously desirous of peace that he was afraid to state his objections lest the doing so might lead to a quarrel, or rouse more or less of animosity either open or concealed; and to have recognized that so long as he had not \u201cattested\u201d the balance sheet, his rights of rectification would be preserved.\nThe fact, if it be a fact, that interest on capital was drawn on under such a basis and profits adjusted on such basis, may render it almost impossible to him acting in such a way, or his representatives, to dispute the correctness thereof, but as matter of law or inference of fact I cannot say so.\nThe results of payment and adjustment of profits may all need reconsideration. Except in one specified way, not followed, I fail to find undisputed fact.\nThe answer to the first part of the question then seems to me very obvious, but the alternative query of\nwhether the actual value of such assets is to be ascertained,\nin the view I take in answering the other questions, seems to need no further consideration.\nWhen it is held as the Appellate Division held that appellant had no option to buy there obviously must be an ascertainment of the actual value of the estate.\nI have come to the conclusion, contrary to impressions I had at the close of the argument, that the surviving partner is not entitled to take over the assets of the firm. There are certainly some contingencies provided for in clauses 9 and 10 of the articles which look as if it had been contemplated that the survivor was expected to do so. But in construing any agreement we must look at it as a whole and see that consistently with the whole, each provision therein is, if at all possible, given at least some due operative effect.\nLet us look at clauses 9 and 10 and see if and how such effect can be given the provisions therein.\nIt is to be observed that there is no obligation imposed upon the survivor to take over the assets and pay therefor to the executors of the deceased his or their share of the value of same.\nIt was so easy to have provided either for that or the contingency of his electing to do so that the omission is not to be lightly supplied. Was such a palpable consideration of their situation not disposed of, designedly, in the way we find it?\nWe must find an intention to provide finally for one or other of such contingencies, as sure to arise upon the happening of events within their view, as being implied in these articles, before we can give effect either to an obligation or alternative option to take over and pay.\nClause 9 is as follows:\u2014\n9. In the event of the death of any partner before the expiration of the term of these articles of partnership, the co-partnership hereby created shall not be dissolved or wound up, but shall be continued by the survivor during the current or financial year, that is until the thirty-first day of January following the date at which the death of any partner occurs, or at the option of the surviving partner during a period not exceeding twelve months from the date of the death of any deceased partner. The surviving partner shall not be required to pay to the representative or representatives of any deceased partner any portion of his capital in the partnership until the expiration of twelve months from the decease of such partner. The capital of any deceased partner shall in the meantime remain in the business and shall bear interest at the rate of six per cent. per annum to the date of payment and the person or persons interested in such capital shall also receive the same share of the profits of the business up to the end of the current or financial year, that is until the 31st day of January following the date at which the death of such partner occurs as would be paid to such partner so dying as aforesaid, if he were still living.\nThere is herein an obligation to continue the business at least to the end of its financial year. All in that clause relative to doing so is clearly a merely prudent provision that would enable the parties concerned to ascertain definitely in the usual appropriate way at the end of the financial year, the condition of the business with regard to which ulterior steps of some kind must of necessity be taken.\nNow in the option given the survivor to extend that period, is there any more implied? I think there is evidently this much, that it seemed to be a thing not unlikely to happen that the survivor might desire to buy and be given every opportunity to arrange for his doing so, as what would probably best accord with the interests of those representing the deceased as well as the survivor. But can it be said the provisions of this clause go further?\nGiving thus due operative effect to all in the clause, relative to such probable contingencies does not seem necessarily to leave anything unfulfilled.\nThe provisions of the clause would be most helpful indeed to facilitate the parties in determining either to wind up the business or sell it out or in arranging that either or both should continue the business. That the year allowed to executors to wind up the estate would probably run concurrently with the year provided for by the clause in a certain event herein may also have been present to the minds of the partners. It seems to me they never intended to go further than make the suitable, but merely, tentative provisions I have indicated. It was because they could not that they omitted to provide any further.\nAnd incidentally we see how he dying first had looked at the matter. His doing so, of course, should not affect our opinion of the true construction of the instrument, beyond making us pause to think before deciding.\nClause 10 is as follows:\u2014\n10. Should any dispute or difference arise between the said partners or between the surviving partner and the representatives of any deceased partner as to the amount which either partner is entitled to be credited with, or liable to be charged with, in making up any annual balance sheet of the co-partnership, or as to the valuation of any of the assets of the co-partnership, such dispute shall be referred to an arbitrator mutually chosen by the parties, or in the event of their failing to agree upon an arbitrator then to such arbitrator as a judge of the High Court shall, upon application of either of the parties, on one week\u2019s notice, in writing, to the other, appoint, and the award or decision in writing of the arbitrator so chosen or appointed shall be binding upon all the parties interested.\nIt is this clause that Mr. Justice Middleton found (and I was for a time much inclined to hold correctly so) the item that conclusively points to the taking over by the surviving partner of the business.\nLet us read this clause carefully and there is absolutely nothing to be found in\nthe valuation of any of the assets of the co-partnership\nbeing made a subject of reference as between the surviving partner and the representatives of the deceased which is inconsistent with a denial of the surviving partner\u2019s claim as of right to take over the business.\nThat reference fits into the very case of stock-taking that existed in January, 1914; and indeed inevitably must fit into some January stock-taking following a death in the firm. The one stock\u2011taking which of all the series it was most important to have accurately done was that following the death of a partner.\nIndeed, as already suggested, it was the chief reason for postponing absolutely the dissolution of the firm till that had taken place.\nI conclude that the appellant is not entitled to take over the business.\nI agree that the goodwill is an asset of the business. And already I have expressed my opinion that the balance sheet of January, 1913, does not bind.\nThe appeal should be dismissed. Nothing was said in argument in regard to costs.\nI doubt the propriety of encouraging, at the expense of any estate, appeals here, by making, even if we can, the costs of such an appeal payable out of the estate. In the peculiar circumstances and, having regard to the insignificance in the difference in the ultimate result of whether the costs come out of the estate or each pay his own, I think each should be left to pay his own costs of this appeal.\nDUFF J.\u2014I think there is sufficient in the articles of the partnership to evidence clearly the intention of the parties to the agreement that in the event of the death of one of the parties during the partnership term, the representatives of the deceased partner should be entitled to require the surviving partner to pay them a sum of money equivalent to the value of his interest in the business and that the correlative right of requiring them to accept such payment should be enjoyed by the surviving partner. The effect of the provisions of the partnership agreement touching the ascertainment of this sum I shall discuss in a moment.\nThe general effect of the contract in so far as it relates to the reciprocal rights of the surviving partner and the representatives of the deceased partner in the event mentioned is that a sum equivalent to the value of the deceased partner\u2019s interest (ascertained in the manner provided for in the deed) is treated, as between the parties (at the election of either of them) as a liability of the firm on payment of which the interest of the deceased partner\u2019s estate in the assets of the partnership is extinguished.\nAs to the mode of ascertainment, I think the effect of the deed is this; the partnership is deemed to have continued to the end of the financial year in which the death occurs (first sentence article 9); by the operation of article 8 an account and a balance sheet as annual account and balance sheet are then to be prepared (arbitration being provided for under article 10 in case of difference) and from this account and balance sheet the value of the interest of the deceased partner is to be determined.\nThis appears to me to be the effect of the deed. I am, however, unable, to see how for practical purposes the acceptance of Mr. Tilley\u2019s contention would affect the rights of the parties, that contention being that for the purpose of ascertaining the value of the interest you are to start with the account taken at the end of the last preceding year, derive from that the value of the deceased\u2019s partner\u2019s share at the date of his death and add the profits for the year in which the death occurred. I cannot see the difference in practical effect because the profits for the last year could only be ascertained by striking a balance between the value of the net assets at the beginning and at the end of the financial year; and for the purpose of ascertaining the profits you must, therefore, value the net assets as at the end of the financial year, and in either case in the event of difference resort must be had to arbitration.\nIf the final account, of course, were to be treated as an account of a species different from the annual account under article 8 the point of construction might be of some importance; and (accepting Mr. Tilley\u2019s contention) the question would still remain open for consideration whether profits for the purpose of the final adjustment are necessarily to be computed upon the same principle as profits for the purpose of the annual account.\nThe point of substance is ultimately reducible to this: Is the account on the one construction to be taken or are the profits on the other construction to be determined on the same principle at the expiration of the last financial year for the purposes of the final settlement as during the previous years for the purpose of the annual accounting under article 8?\nI think the question must be answered in the affirmative for this reason, namely, the method exclusively ordained by the articles for ascertaining the value of the interest of each for any of the purposes of the deed, for the purpose, for example, of computing interest payable under article 5 is to be found in article 8, which provides for an account and balance sheet made up through the co-operation of the parties at the end of each year, with a reference to arbitration in the event of disagreement, and it must, I think, be assumed that it is with reference to this provision that article 9 was framed.\nThe result is that for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not goodwill is to be valued as an asset for the partnership we must consider the effect of article 8. I think the evidence before us is conclusive against the respondent\u2019s contention as to the effect of this article. The accounts made up annually by the partners cannot be presumed to have been made up in total disregard of the effect of them in relation to a possible settlement under article 9 and the omission of goodwill conclusively shews, in my view, that the partners did not regard it as one of the subjects constituting the partnership \u201cassets\u201d for the purposes of article 8.\nANGLIN J.\u2014With great respect for the learned judges of the Appellate Division, I am of the opinion that the partnership agreement makes it clear that it was intended that the surviving partner should have the option to continue the business of the firm and to become the purchaser of the interest of his deceased partner. The clause providing for retention of the deceased partner\u2019s capital in the business for one year and the provision for a valuation by arbitration of assets as between the surviving partner and the representatives of the deceased partner are, I think, inexplicable on any other assumption. They make it clear\u2014at all events they raise a case of necessary implication within the meaning of the dicta of Esher M.R., and Kay L.J., in Hamlyn & Co. v. Wood & Co.[3], at pages 491, 494\u2014that the surviving partner should have an option to acquire the interest of a deceased partner, and that, as Mr. Tilley conceded, upon the surviving partner exercising his declared right to retain the capital of the deceased partner for a year after his death, the option to purchase became an obligation. To this extent I would allow this appeal, but upon the other questions I think it should fail.\nThere is nothing in the agreement which limits the interest of the deceased partner to such assets as the partners had seen fit for other purposes to treat as items of capital in their annual balance sheets. The agreement provides for a continuation of the partnership until the 31st January following the death of either partner. During the intervening period the deceased partner\u2019s estate is to receive interest under clause 5, by virtue of the continuation of the partnership, on the basis of the share of the deceased partner in the capital as ascertained and defined by the annual balance sheet made at the beginning of the financial year, and in addition, a share of profits on the same basis as the deceased partner would have received them had he been living. But, the partnership continuing, a new account of the stock in trade, assets and liabilities of the partnership and a new balance sheet were due under clause 8 of the agreement at the expiration of the partnership year on the 31st January, 1914. If the taking of that account and the making of that balance sheet should occasion disagreement, clause 10 provides for an adjustment by arbitration and, inter alia, for the valuation of the assets of the co-partnership. For what purpose? For none that I can believe the parties would have thus provided for, if it was intended that the value of the share of the deceased partner was for all purposes, including the fixing of his interest in the assets on dissolution, to be determined by the amount stated to have been his share of the capital in the last balance sheet prepared during his life time. I think it is clear that, from the 31st January, 1914, it was the surviving partner\u2019s capital as of that date, to be ascertained by agreement or by arbitration, involving a valuation of all the partnership assets, including goodwill as well as everything else which could be deemed an asset, which should thereafter bear interest at 6% and should be payable at the expiry of the year from the death of the deceased partner by the survivor to the representative of such deceased partner as the purchase price of his interest in the partnership. I find nothing in the agreement which warrants an inference that it was the intention of the parties that the survivor should receive as a present from the estate of his deceased partner the share of the latter in an asset such as the goodwill of the business with which we are dealing would seem to be, or in any other asset omitted from the balance sheet of 1913, which was prepared chiefly, if not solely, for the purpose of determining the basis upon which interest should be computed for the ensuing year under clause 5 of the agreement.\nIn view of the divided success there should be no costs of this appeal.\nBRODEUR J. (dissenting).\u2014The most important point we have to determine in this case is whether the appellant, who is surviving partner of Wood, Vallance & Co., is entitled to take over the interest of his late partner, William Vallance, in the said partnership assets.\nMr. Justice Middleton, in the Supreme Court, held that the survivor was entitled to exercise that right of pre-emption. The first appellate division, however, held a contrary view.\nThe co-partnership agreement was made on the 31st of January, 1910, for a period of five years for the purpose of continuing the hardware business of Wood, Vallance & Co. The capital put in by Mr. Wood was $577,524.21, and the capital of the late Mr. William Vallance $479,243.32. Each partner was allowed interest upon the amount of capital from time to time at his credit in the books of the firm and the profits were apportioned equally between the partners. It was provided that an annual balance sheet should be made on the 31st of January each year which should be attested by each of the partners.\nThere is no provision as to the amount which could be paid weekly or monthly to the partners; but it is presumed that they were drawing money as they liked, affecting even to a certain extent their capital, since in the balance sheet of each year their capital was different, as appears by the following table:\u2014\nCAPITAL.\nWm. Wood.\nWm. Vallance.\n31st January, 1910\n$577,524.21\n$479,243.32\n31st January, 1911\n514,433.78\n329,334.79\n31st January, 1912\n230,662.19\n259,350.58\n31st January, 1913\n260,019.11\n292,175.97\nIt is a rule of law that the capital put in by the partners should not be impaired. However, the figures which I have just given shew conclusively that the partners were drawing money out of their capital, and I may add also that the right to withdraw was implied from clause 5 of the partnership agreement which stated that\neach of the partners shall be allowed interest at the rate of six per cent. per annum upon the amount of capital which may from time to time be at his credit in the books of the said firm. * * *\nThe answer to the question which has been enunciated above turns mostly on the construction of clauses 9 and 10 of the partnership agreement.\nIn clause 9 it was provided that\nin the event of death of any partner the co-partnership hereby created shall not be thereby dissolved or wound up, but shall be continued by the survivor during the current or financial year, that is until the thirty-first day of January following the date at which the death of any partner occurs, or at the option of the surviving partner during a period not exceeding twelve months from the date of the death of any deceased partner. The surviving partner shall not be required to pay to the representative or representatives of any deceased partner any portion of his capital in the partnership until the expiration of twelve months from the decease of such partner. The capital of any deceased partner shall in the meantime remain in the business and shall bear interest at the rate of six per cent. per annum to the date of payment. * * *\nBy clause 10 it was provided that if a dispute arose between the partners or between one partner and the representatives of any deceased partner as to the amount to which each partner was entitled or as to the valuation of any assets, said dispute should be referred to an arbitrator.\nIt seems to me that if the partner had intended to give to the other partner a right of pre\u2011emption, there should have been a formal stipulation to that effect. But no such stipulation is contained in the contract and then the question arises as to whether there is an implied right for the surviving partner to take over the assets of the firm. Lord Esher in Hamlyn & Co. v. Wood & Co.[4], at page 491, stated as to when and how terms not expressed in a contract may be implied:\u2014\nI have for a long time understood that rule to be that the Court has no right to imply in a written contract any such stipulation unless on considering the terms of the contract in a reasonable and business-like manner an implication necessarily arises that the parties must have intended that the suggested stipulation should exist. It is not enough to say that it would be a reasonable thing to make such an implication. It must be a necessary implication in the sense that I have mentioned.\nIn this case, what is simply provided for is, according to my construction of the partnership agreement, that at the death of one of the partners the partnership should continue to exist until the 31st January then next, each partner being entitled to the same share of the profits and to the same interest on their respective capital. There is no allowance provided for in favour of the surviving partner. The latter, however, is empowered to have the partnership continued for a further period not exceeding a year from the date of the death of the deceased. In such a case, however, the profits would belong exclusively to the surviving partner and he would be bound to pay only the interest on the capital of the deceased.\nThe following provision in clause 9, which declares that\nthe surviving partner shall not be required to pay to the representative or representatives of any deceased partner any portion of his capital\nshould not be construed as meaning that the surviving partner has the right to purchase the assets of the firm, but that during the period of a year the representatives of the deceased partner would not be en- titled to draw, as used to be done formerly, any money out of the capital.\nTo construe this provision as creating a right of pre-emption would, according to my opinion, create an implication which would not necessarily arise. Those words have been put there simply for the purpose of preventing the representatives of the deceased from drawing on their capital the same as used to be done during the life of the two partners and that the capital should remain intact during that period. The parties had likely in contemplation hard times and they provided that the success of the business should not be impaired by any reduction of capital.\nWe are asked also to state whether the good will of the partnership would be considered as an asset.\nThis question does not become very important in view of the conclusion I have reached on the first question. If the surviving partner has no right of pre-emption, then it is very indifferent for both of them whether the good will should be included or not in the assets of the partnership. Clause 2 of the agreement defined what the capital of the partnership would be and they stated that it included their interest in the stock, trade, book debts and other assets.\nNow, in the balance sheet which was prepared each year no mention is made of the good will. The good will is all the same an asset and sometimes a very good asset of the business. When you take a company like this one, which has been in existence for more than 60 years, it must be a very valuable asset. It is true that in their annual statement they were not including that good will and I understand it is not usually done in the inventory made by business firms. It is all the same an asset which could be disposed of when the winding-up took place. Another question was whether in the valuation of the assets the value appearing on the balance sheet of the 31st January, 1913, is binding on the executors of William Vallance or whether the actual value of such assets is to be ascertained.\nThis balance sheet was evidently prepared every year with the concurrence and assent of both partners. It is true that it was not signed by them, but it was always considered as binding, since interest had to be paid on the capital shewn by that balance sheet. But when the business of the partnership is wound up, the assets have to be ascertained in the ordinary way.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed in part without costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: S.F.

The provisions of the Alberta \"Arbitration Act\" of 1909, in relation to references to arbitration, apply to proceedings on arbitrations under the Alberta \"Railway Act\" of 1907, and give power to the court or a judge, on an appeal from the award made, to remit the matters referred to the arbitrators for reconsideration. Anglin J. inclined to the contrary opinion.\nPer Davies, Idington and Anglin JJ. (Fitzpatrick C.J. contra).\u2014When arbitrators have violated the provisions of section 10 of the \"Alberta Evidence Act\" of 1910 by receiving the testimony of a greater number of expert witnesses than three, as thereby limited, upon either side of the controversy, their award should be set aside by the court upon an appeal.\nPer Fitzpatrick C.J. and Idington J. (Davies J. contra).\u2014An affidavit of the party whose property has been expropriated, made for different purposes several years prior to the expropriation proceedings, cannot properly be taken into consideration by arbitrators as evidence establishing the value of the property at the time of its expropriation.\nPer Idington and Brodeur JJ.\u2014In the circumstances of the case the arbitrators were not functi officiis, as their award had been invalidly made.\nThe appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta (8 Alta. L. R. 379) and the cross-appeal therefrom were dismissed with costs. APPEAL AND CROSS-APPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], setting aside an award made by arbitrators and referring the matter back to the arbitrators for reconsideration and determination anew of the compensation to be awarded for lands expropriated for railway purposes.\nOn proceedings taken for the expropriation of the respondent's lands for railway purposes under the Alberta \"Railway Act\" of 1907, arbitrators were appointed, on 25th June, 1913, and they proceeded with the arbitration on 16th December, 1913, rendering their award on the 21st February, 1914. During the proceedings the arbitrators allowed evidence to be adduced by the opinion testimony of a greater number of witnesses than that limited in regard to expert testimony by the \"Alberta Evidence Act\", ch. 3, sec. 10, of the statutes of 1910, (2nd sess.) on behalf of the party expropriated, and also refused to receive in evidence an affidavit respecting the value of the lands in question, made by the respondent in the year 1911, when applying for probate of the will of his deceased wife, for the purposes of fixing the succession duty payable in regard to her estate. Upon the opening of the arbitration proceedings, it was determined, with the assent of the parties, that the compensation to be awarded should be upon the basis of the value of the lands at that time, and this appeared to be the date adopted by the arbitrators in the estimation of the value of the lands expropriated.\nOn an appeal by the railway company, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta set aside the award of the arbitrators, on the ground that they had improperly heard opinion evidence as to the value of the lands contrary to the provisions of the \"Evidence Act,\" and, being of opinion that on the evidence the court was unable itself to make an award, referred the matter back to the arbitrators to determine anew the compensation to be paid without regard to the evidence theretofore taken.\nThe railway company now appealed against that portion of the judgment of the court below which referred the matter back to the arbitrators for reconsideration and the respondent, by cross-appeal, contended that the award ought not to have been set aside for the reason stated by the court and that the award of the arbitrators should have been confirmed.\nChrysler K.C. for the appellants. The points in respect of which we allege error are (1) that the court had no power to direct a reference back to the arbitrators to determine anew the compensation, (2) that the arbitrators had no power to proceed further, they being functi officiis, and (3) that, in any case, this matter does not fall within the class of cases in which the court has jurisdiction to refer an award back to the arbitrators.\nThe Alberta \"Railway Act,\" ch. 8, of 1907, contains a complete code in respect of compensation by arbitration for lands taken by railway companies, and the sections, 99 to 114, referring to arbitrations make very complete provision for all contingencies but give no authority to remit any award to the arbitrators. For the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Alberta, see the \"Judicature Ordinance,\" ch. 21 of 1898, secs. 3, 8 and 10.\nThe Alberta \"Arbitration Act,\" ch. 6 of 1909, has no application to proceedings under the \"Railway Act,\" of 1907, and the provisions as to arbitration, in the \"Railway Act,\" are self-contained, and constitute a complete code of provisions for the expropriation of lands under that Act. The \"Arbitration Act\" applies only to the classes of arbitrations\u2014(1) which depend upon a written agreement for submission of present or future differences to arbitration (sec.2, sub-sec. 1), (2) which originate by order of reference (sec. 11), and (3) statutory arbitrations under section 17. Proceedings under the \"Arbitration Act,\" differ from and are inconsistent with the provisions of the \"Railway Act,\" which is silent as to remitting awards but makes express provision for setting aside awards and appealing therefrom. It was clearly the intention of the legislature to exclude any provision as to remitting awards. See Simpson Commissioners of Inland Revenue[2]; In re Keighley, Maxsted & Co. and Durant & Co.[3]; North Riding of Yorkshire County Council v. Middlesborough County Borough Council[4]; Re British Columbia Railway Act and Canadian Northern Pac. Rway. Co.[5]; London and Blackwall Rway. Co. v. Board of Works for Limehouse District[6]; Canadian Northern Ontario Rway. Co. v. Holditch[7]; In re Davies and James Bay Rway. Co.[8]; In re McAlpine and Lake Erie and Detroit River Rway. Co.[9].\nEven under the \"Arbitration Act\" there would be no right to remit any such case as the present. This right arises in four cases only: (1) when the award is bad on the face of it; (2) when there has been misconduct on the part of the arbitrator; (3) when there has been admitted mistake and the arbitrator himself asks that the matter be remitted; and (4) when addi- tional evidence has been discovered after the making of the award. Green v. Citizens' Insurance Co.[10]; In re Keighley, Maxsted & Co., and Durant & Co.[11]; Re Montgomery Jones & Co., and Liebenthal & Co.[12]; Re Grand Trunk Railway Co., and Petrie[13].\nIn any case the arbitrators are functi officiis. Snetsinger v. Peterson[14].\nThe award was properly set aside but it was impossible for the court itself to make an award, not only because improper evidence had been heard, but also because of the exclusion by the arbitrators of the affidavit of the owner, which made a valuation of the lands in question, and which might have materially affected the award in determining the value of the lands taken. This affidavit was made by the owner in 1911, before the question of expropriation by the railway was considered. Two witnesses for the owner gave evidence that from 1911 to 1913 the land had increased in value fifty per cent. By this method of ascertainment, the value of the land, in 1913, would have been only a small fraction of the sum awarded. While the arbitrators were not bound to accept this method of ascertaining the compensation, the appellants were at least entitled to use the affidavit as an admission.\nThe proceedings proved abortive, and the proper course would have been to allow the parties to proceed de novo to have the compensation determined by arbitration.\nFrank Ford K.C. for the respondent The reasoning of their Lordships Justices Duff and Anglin in the case of the Canadian Northern Ontario Rway. Co. v. Holditch[15], relied upon by the appellants, and of Meredith J. in Re McAlpine and Lake Erie and Detroit River Rway. Co.[16], cannot now prevail in view of the decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Cedars Rapids Manufacturing and Power Co. v. Lacoste[17]. It is not necessary to consider the position as it might arise under the Dominion \"Railway Act\" if the Alberta \"Arbitration Act\" has application to the proceedings of the arbitrators in the present case. The sections to be referred to are secs. 2, 11 and 17 and, in view of the general scope of that Act, as well as of the sections referred to, their terms cannot be taken in the restricted sense in which similar provisions of the Dominion \"Railway Act\" were treated in the cases above cited.\nOn the cross-appeal, we contend that the appellants are estopped, by the agreement entered into at the commencement of the arbitration proceedings, from taking the ground now that the arbitrators were wrong in fixing the value of the lands on the basis of their value at the time of the arbitration. On this point we adopt the reasoning of Mr. Justice Stuart in the court below. In the alternative we submit that the agreement amounted to a submission to arbitration outside of and apart from the \"Railway Act,\" or, in further alternative, that it estops the appellants from setting up that a mistake was made by the arbitrators.\nAs to the infringement, as alleged, of the \"Evidence Act\" in regard to the hearing of opinion evidence, the provisions of section 10 of that statute are uncertain: Re Scamen and Canadian Northern Rway. Co. [18] and it makes it highly dangerous to apply them literally, if indeed any literal meaning can be taken from them. Section 106 of the Alberta \"Railway Act\" authorizes arbitrators to proceed to ascertain the amount of compensation to be awarded \"in such way as they or he or a majority of them deem best\", and the legislature could not have intended absolutely to restrict that power. See Phipson on Evidence, ch. 35. As appellants' counsel cross-examined the expert witnesses objection to the admissibility of their testimony cannot be taken on appeal.\nThe affidavit tendered in evidence was entirely irrelevant as to the value of the lands in question either as of the date of the proceedings before the arbitrators or as of the date of the judge's order appointing them; the valuation therein made had relation merely to the time of the death of the respondent's deceased wife in the year 1911.\nIt is submitted that the appeal should be dismissed with costs and that the cross-appeal should be allowed and the award of the arbitrators restored with costs.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This appeal and the cross-appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nWithout expressing any opinion as to whether in expropriation proceedings under the Dominion \"Railway Act\" the arbitrators having once made an award are functi officio (compare Cedars Rapids Manufacturing and Power Co. v. Lacoste[19] with Holditch v. Canadian Northern Ontario Rway. Co. [20] at page 541), I am satisfied that the provincial \"Arbitration Act\" (ch. 6, Statutes of Alberta, 1909, sec. 11) gives to the Alberta court, on appeal, in all cases of arbitration the power to remit or set aside an award. The sections of the Alberta \"Arbitration Act\" are quoted at length by Sir Louis Davies in his judgment.\nI agree in the conclusions reached by my brother Idington with respect to the admissibility in these proceedings of the affidavit made by the respondent Moore at another time for an entirely different purpose. One can easily imagine conditions under which such a document might be properly introduced, but although a statement made by a party to a proceeding may be used against him as an admission, whenever it is made, I am satisfied that no fault can be found with the arbitrators for having refused to receive the affidavit in the circumstances under which it was offered here.\nI am not quite satisfied that section 10 of the \"Evidence Act\" limiting the number of expert witnesses is applicable to proceedings in which such wide powers are given to the arbitrators. Section 106 of the \"Railway Act\" directs the arbitrators to proceed to ascertain the compensation due\nin such way as they, or he, or a majority of them deem best.\"\nThat statute creates for expropriation purposes a tribunal with wide and exceptional powers which it cannot fully exercise if hampered by the special limitations of the \"Evidence Act,\" and I would be disposed to hold that the arbitrators were at liberty to examine or permit the examination of as many witnesses as they thought desirable. In other words, the arbitrators are, in this regard, limited solely by the bounds of a sound and honest discretion, but I defer on this point to the views of the majority.\nDAVIES J.\u2014The appeal by the railway company in this case is from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, only in so far as that judgment purports to' refer the award back to the board of arbitrators.\nThere is also a cross-appeal by the respondent claiming the judgment appealed from to be erroneous in holding that the arbitrators erred in admitting the testimony of more than three witnesses giving their opinion as to the value of the lands compensation for the taking of which under the provincial \"Railway Act\" the arbitrators were assessing.\nOn the main appeal as to the power of the court to refer the award back to the arbitrators, I am of opinion that the court possessed such power.\nThe Alberta \"Railway Act,\" 1907, ch. 8, in its 114th section, provides for an appeal to the court in cases where the award exceeds $600 and declares that upon the hearing of the appeal the court shall, if the question is one of fact, decide the same upon the evidence taken and in sub-section 2 declares that, upon such appeal, the practice and proceedings shall be as nearly as may be the same as upon an appeal from the decision of an inferior court.\nSub-section 3 says:\nThe right of appeal hereby given shall not affect the existing law or practice in the province as to setting aside awards.\nThen the \"Arbitration Act\" has the following provisions (Alberta statutes, 1909, ch. 6, defining the law with respect to references to arbitration):\u2014\nSection 2:\u2014In this Act, unless the contrary intention appears:\u2014\n1. \"Submission\" means a written agreement to submit present or future differences to arbitration whether an arbitrator is named therein or not.\nSection 11.\u2014In all cases of reference to arbitration the court or a judge may from time to time remit the matters referred, or any of them, to the reconsideration of the arbitrators or umpire.\nSection 17.\u2014Whenever it is directed by any Act or Ordinance that any party or parties shall proceed to the appointment of arbitrators or appoint arbitrators as provided by this Act or that any party or parties shall proceed to arbitration under this Act or any similar direction shall be made with respect to arbitration under this Act such direction shall be deemed a submission.\nWhile sub-section 3 of section. 114 of the \"Railway Act,\" above quoted by me, is not as clear as it might be and does not in so many words speak of remitting the award back, I cannot doubt that in its true construction it covers such a power of remitting back the matter referred for reconsideration.\nIn my judgment sub-section 3 of section 114 of the \"Railway Act\" should be held to cover and incorporate these sections of the \"Arbitration Act\" above cited and, when read together with the 17th section, vest in the court the power of remitting awards back made under the \"Railway Act\" for reconsideration, which they have exercised in this case.\nThis conclusion renders it unnecessary on my part to consider the question of the power of the court to remit back an award where no statutory authority to do so exists.\nThen as to the cross-appeal of the respondent, who contends that the award should be upheld and not remitted back, I am also of opinion that this cross-appeal must be dismissed.\nTwo contentions were advanced against the validity of the award\u2014one was that the arbitrators valued the lands as of the wrong date, taking the time when the arbitration was held, 16th December, 1913, instead of the date when the judge's order was made appointing the arbitrators, namely, the 25th June, 1913.\nIt is not necessary under the circumstances of this case to determine the exact date with reference to which \"compensation or damages are to be ascertained.\" Sub-section 2 of section 100 mentions three different dates. The first is where there is an agreement made between the parties respecting the lands taken or the compensation to be paid as provided in section 99 and, in such case, the date of the agreement is to be the date for fixing compensation. The other dates where there is no agreement are the service of the notice to treat or the order of the judge made for the appointment of an arbitrator or arbitrators. As between these two latter dates cases may arise in which it would be important to determine which should govern.\nIn the present case, I concur with the judgment of the appellate court that the parties having agreed at the opening of the arbitration proceedings to adopt the \"time of the arbitration\" as the date for fixing the compensation, and as the evidence shewed clearly there was no difference in the values of the lands during the year 1913, the date agreed upon, 16th December, 1913, was for all practical purposes the same as that of judge's order, 25th June of the same year, so that no error prejudicing either party was under the circumstances committed. No question was raised as between the date of the judge's order and that of the notice to treat given in the latter part of 1912 and it must be taken that all parties agreed at the arbitration to take the time of the arbitration as the proper time to fix the valuation.\nThe other objection to the validity of the award and the one sustained by the appellate court was that the provisions of section 10 of the \"Evidence Act\" limiting the number of expert witnesses to three upon either side had been violated by the admission against the objection of the railway company of more than the statutory number.\nThe facts respecting the number of witnesses called and examined on the part of the owner are set out fully in the reasons for the judgment of the court given by Mr. Justice Stuart. It is unnecessary for me to repeat them here. I agree with the conclusion reached by him that the statute had been clearly violated and that\nthe arbitrators admitted very important evidence as to value which was inadmissible and that it was impossible to say what weight they attached to that evidence\nor whether it was not \"the controlling evidence in their minds.\"\nUnder these circumstances, I think the court was right, having the power to do so, to remit the award back to the arbitrators' and not to attempt under the circumstances the almost impossible task of making an award themselves.\nI am also of opinion that the court was right in holding that the affidavit of the respondent as to the value of the land made by him on his application for probate was improperly rejected. The weight to be given to such an affidavit was a matter entirely for the arbitrators under all the facts and circumstances existing when the affidavit was made. But it should not have been excluded from their consideration.\nFor the foregoing reasons, I would dismiss both the appeal and the cross-appeal with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The appellant claims that the court of appeal for Alberta had no power, upon setting aside the award, made by the arbitrators appointed under the \"Railway Act\" of Alberta, to determine the compensation to be made respondent for lands taken and injuriously affected by the exercise of some of the powers of the appellant in the way of expropriation, to remit the matter so in question to the arbitrators.\nIt argues that the same result should follow as formerly followed upon the setting aside of an award under a submission at common law. It overlooks, in making such a contention in this appeal, the wide difference in many respects between a submission by parties, relative to the disposition of a matter in dispute between them, and this statutory method of determining the amount of compensation to be made for what must be surrendered and endured by him whose rights have been invaded by virtue of the statutory powers given the expropriating company.\nThe common law award being set aside the parties still had their full right to resort to the courts to enforce their respective claims and recover or have therein determined what they might be entitled to.\nIn expropriation cases the party whose property is taken has no remedy except that furnished by the statute authorizing the taking.\nThat remedy is the constitution of a board appointed by the parties, or, default their agreeing, by the court, and that board has not discharged its duty until it has made an award reached by due process of law within the contemplation of the statute. If it produces an award which in law is null, then on what legal principle can it be said to be discharged of or relieved from the performance of that duty it has undertaken?\nThat, however, is not the only thing the appellant has overlooked, for there has been much legislation in the several jurisdictions, where the common law prevails, to supplement the powers of the court relative to awards and enable much to be done which could not formerly have been done in the way of relieving unfortunate litigants.\nIt does not appear to me herein necessary to follow the argument relative to the legislation of that kind in Alberta, or forming part of the law introduced into Alberta, and determine whether or not it is applicable to the arbitration here in question, further than to point out that the Alberta \"Arbitration Act\" expressly provides, by section 2, as follows:\u2014\nSection 2.\u2014In this Act, unless the contrary intention appears:\u2014\n1. \"Submission\" means a written agreement to submit present or future differences to arbitration whether an arbitrator is named therein or not;\nand by section 11, as follows:\u2014\n11.\u2014In all cases of reference to arbitration the court or a judge may from time to time remit the matters referred or any of them to the reconsideration of the arbitrators or umpire.\nand by section 17, as follows:\u2014\nSection 17.\u2014Whenever it is directed by any Act or Ordinance that any party or parties shall proceed to the appointment of arbitrators or appoint arbitrators as provided by this Act or that any party or parties shall proceed to arbitration under this Act or any similar direction shall be made with respect to arbitration under this Act such direction shall be deemed a submission.\nThe enactments seem clearly designed to provide for the very contingency in question herein.\nIt is to be observed that the appellant railway company is the creation of the Alberta Legislature and the proceedings were taken under its \"Railway Act.\"\nAnd in any event, as already suggested, the award having been set aside because of the non-performance according to law of the duty assumed by or cast by law upon the board of arbitrators they must in law proceed to the discharge of that duty in a proper manner, whether specially directed or not, does not seem to matter very much.\nThe judgment in the case of Cedars Rapids Manufacturing and Power Co. v. Lacoste[21], seems to assume as a matter of course the power and duty of the appellate court to remit the matters to the arbitrators, who had erred, as here, to hear evidence and make an award in accordance with the principle expressed in the opinion judgment of the Judicial Committee. The powers of expropriation and method of fixing compensation in question therein were those of the Dominion \"Railway Act\" as it stood revised in 1903. Surely if that set of provisions enabled a remitting of the case those under the Acts I have referred to which are still more comprehensive and elastic can enable the court below to do so.\nThe court of appeal for Alberta has decided it cannot under the circumstances of the appeal there determine the matter pursuant to section 114 of the \"Railway Act\" and it has not been contended by the cross-appeal herein that such conclusion is erroneous if the questions of law or either of them passed upon by it has been properly maintained.\nThe cross-appeal however claims that court erred therein and seeks a reversal of the decision.\nI see no reason to quarrel with the judgment so far as it relates to the question of opinion evidence and therefore the judgment remitting the matter to the board of arbitrators should stand.\nI am, however, not able to agree with the holding of that court relative to the admissibility of the respondent's affidavit made as an administrator in the course of settling the question of succession duties when valuing the entire property of which only a fractional part is in question.\nThe question to be tried is the value of the property taken or injuriously affected at another and later time and, hence as evidence of that it certainly cannot be treated as an admission against an administrator of the fact to be tried or anything clearly and directly bearing thereon.\nI can conceive of such an affidavit being used in cross-examination, had respondent been a witness, or in the like event in contradiction; and as a most efficient weapon in the hands of the counsel for appellant if he saw fit to put respondent in the witness box.\nBut in. principle I cannot think the affidavit apart from some such contingencies can be properly admitted.\nI do not think the part of the formal judgment directing a trial anew necessary or even expedient, if respondent is willing to strike out the excessive expert testimony and rest the case there.\nIn such event there should be no such order touching costs as the judgment directs.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed and the form of order adopted by the court above in the Cedars Rapids Case[22] in regard to costs throughout, and otherwise should be adopted.\nANGLIN. J.\u2014I agree with the view of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, stated by Mr. Justice Scott, that the provisions of section 10 of the Alberta \"Evidence Act\" were violated on the arbitration under review. It may be that section 106 of the Alberta \"Railway Act\" authorizes arbitrators themselves to call expert witnesses in addition to the number allowed by the \"Evidence Act\" to be \"called upon either side.\" That case is not before us and I express no opinion upon it.\nLikewise it may be open to, the parties themselves to give in evidence the opinions of three witnesses on each issue in an action or arbitration which admits of such testimony being adduced. That question also is not before us and I express no opinion upon it.\nWhile the meaning of section 100 (2) of the Alberta \"Railway Act\" is quite uncertain, and clarifying legislation would seem to be greatly needed, I think that under the circumstances of this case there was no error in fixing the date as of which compensation should be ascertained.\nThe arbitration here in question was held under the provincial \"Railway Act.\" Section 17 of the provincial \"Arbitration Act\" is invoked by the respondent as a provision making the various sections of that statute applicable to any arbitration directed by any Act or ordinance of the province. But the limitative words \"as provided by this Act,\" found in section 17, indicate that its effect is much more restricted. One of the provisions of the \"Arbitration Act\" is that\nIn all cases of reference to arbitration the court or a judge may from time to time remit the matters referred or any of them to the reconsideration of the arbitrators or umpire (sec. 11).\nIf this section were applicable, this case would be clearly distinguishable from Canadian Northern Ontario Railway Co. v. Holditch[23], in which the arbitration dealt with took place under the Dominion \"Railway Act.\"\nI understand a majority of the court is of the opinion that the order referring the award back to the arbitrators was properly made. I incline to the contrary opinion.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014The question on the main appeal is whether the Appellate Division of Supreme Court of Alberta had the power, under the provisions of the \"Railway Act\" of that province, to direct a reference back to the board of arbitrators to determine anew the compensation.\nBy section 114 of the \"Railway Act\" of 1907, of Alberta, chapter 8, it is stated that Whenever the award exceeds $600.00, any party to the arbitration may within one month * * of the making of the award appeal therefrom upon any question of law or fact to the court.\nSub-section 3.\u2014The right of appeal hereby given shall not affect the existing law or practice in the province as to setting aside awards.\nIt is submitted on the part of the respondent that the provisions of the \"Arbitration Act\" of that province (ch. 6, of 1909) apply to arbitration proceedings under the \"Railway Act.\" so long as they are not absolutely inconsistent with its provisions, and he relies on section 2 and section 17 of the \"Arbitration Act.\"\nSection 2 defines a submission as meaning a written agreement to submit differences to arbitration.\nThen section 17 declares that\nWhenever it is directed by any Act or Ordinance that any party or parties shall proceed to the appointment of arbitrators or appoint arbitrators as provided by this Act or that any party or parties shall proceed to arbitration under this Act or any similar direction shall be made with respect to arbitration under this Act, such direction shall be deemed a submission.\nThe \"Railway Act\" determines how the arbitrators are to be appointed and regulates to a certain extent their proceedings. But I cannot agree with the appellants when they claim that the provisions as to arbitration in the \"Railway Act\" are self-contained and constitute a complete code of provisions for the expropriation of land. Of course, in cases where the provisions of the \"Railway Act\" and of the \"Arbitration Act\u201d are inconsistent the ''Railway Act\" should prevail; but in virtue of section 17 of the \"Arbitration Act,\" which I have quoted above, it-seems to me that where there are no provisions in the \"Railway Act\" as to procedure or as to the power of the court then that procedure and those powers should be determined by the \"Arbitration Act.\" Now, by the \"Arbitration Act,\" it is stated that in all cases of reference to arbitration the court may remit the matter referred to the reconsideration of the arbitrators (sec. 11). In the case of Cedars Rapids Manufacturing and Power Co. v. Lacoste[24], the Privy Council, in setting aside an award, ordered that the matter should be remitted to the arbitrators.\nIn the latter case the proceedings were instituted under the Dominion \"Railway Act\" in which we find provisions which might lead us to conclude that the arbitrators were functi officio. Those restrictions are not to be found in the \"Railway Act\" of Alberta.\nIt seems to me in these circumstances that the court below had the power to send back the matter referred to be determined anew by the arbitrators.\nThe respondent has made a cross-appeal and claims that the reasons given by the court below for setting aside the award should not be accepted.\nThe grounds upon which the court below set aside the award are that evidence was admitted which should have been rejected and that proper evidence was not admitted.\nThere is no doubt, in my opinion, that the Alberta \"Evidence Act\" applies to proceedings before arbitrators; sec. 2, sub-sec. 1. By the provisions of section 10 of that Act it is declared that the number of expert witnesses should not exceed three. The arbitrators in this case, however, have allowed a larger number of expert witnesses than the law permits to be examined. It was one of the grounds on which the court below found that the award should be set aside. I do not see any valid reason why this opinion should not stand. It is not necessary for me then to examine the other question which was raised as to whether some evidence had been improperly excluded.\nFor these reasons the appeal and the cross-appeal should both be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal and cross-appeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] 8 Alta.

The application was accepted, the premium paid, and the policy forwarded to the agent, with instructions to reconcile a discrepancy between the application and the doctor's return as to D.'s age before delivering it. The agent then ascertained that the age of 64 given in the application should have been 65, and obtained from D. the additional premium required for a $1,000 policy at that age. A new policy was sent by the head office to the agent, who did not deliver it on hearing that D. was ill. She died a few days later The beneficiary brought action for specific performance of the contract to deliver a policy for $1,000 or for payment of that amount. A condition of the policy sent to the agent was that it should not take effect until delivered, the first premium paid, and the official receipt surrendered during the lifetime and continued good health of the assured.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick (43 N.B. Rep. 580) and of the trial judge (43 N.B. Rep. 325), Davies and Brodeur JJ. dissenting, that there was no completed contract of insurance between the company and D. at the time of the latter's death, as the condition as to delivery of the policy and surrender of the receipt during the lifetime and continued good, health of the assured was not complied with North American Life Assur. Co. v. Elson (33 Can.

Elson3 was not applicable under the terms of the policy in this case.\nDaniel Mullin K.C. for the appellant.\nFred. R. Taylor K.C. for the respondents\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDavies J. (dissenting)\u2014The defence set up by the insurance company in this action is, in my judgment, an unrighteous one. I am glad to be able to find that, so far as I am concerned, it cannot prevail.\nThe real questions, and indeed the only material ones, in my judgment, are whether the policy of insurance was legally delivered before there was a change in the nature of the risk, and, if so, whether condition 1 of the policy prevented it attaching. The application for insurance of Mrs. Donovan was taken by the provincial manager and forwarded by him to the company. On the 18th March, 1912, they had received the application, and wrote to their manager as follows:\u2014\nToronto, March 18th, 1912.\nF. S. Ferris, Esq.,\nProvincial Manager,\nSt. John, N.B.\nDear Sir,\nRe Application of Mrs. Julia Donovan.\nWe have accepted this application, and are issuing policy, but before delivering the same, you will please ascertain from Dr. Pratt that he has sent in his confidential report, and that it is satisfactory. It is not yet to hand.\nYou will also reconcile Dr. Pratt's statement that the applicant is sixty-five, whereas the applicant herself gives her age as sixty-four. In a case of this kind, in future, in view of the age, it is best that proof of age be submitted, with a view of the same being admitted on the policy.\nYours truly,\nE. Marshall,\nGeneral Manager.\nNow, I take it as clearly decided by this court, in the case of North American Life Assurance Co, v. Elson[9], that if the letter contained nothing more than the first two statements,\nwe have accepted this application and are issuing policy,\njust as soon as the policy was executed and posted to the general agent, the contract of assurance would have been complete. If it was destroyed in the mail or otherwise lost, that would not have affected its validity nor could any action of the local agent do so. There would then have been a completed contract of assurance, the premium having been paid and accepted.\nThe question, however, in this case is whether the letter did not shew a qualified or conditional delivery, and, if so, whether the conditions were complied with. I think it did, because the general agent was informed he was not to deliver the policy until he had ascertained, first, that Dr. Pratt had forwarded his confidential report and that it was satisfactory, and had\nreconciled Dr. Pratt's statement that the applicant was 65, whereas the applicant herself gave her age as 64.\nThe policy itself, a 20-year endowment policy for $1,000 on the life of Julia Donovan, was issued by the defendant under its seal from the head office in Toronto, payable, in the event of the death of the insured, to her daughter, the plaintiff. The manager in St. John received it in due course of mail, and, in his evidence, says \"he presumed he called upon Dr. Pratt,\" but could not remember whether he saw him, but he would not undertake to say that he did not see him.\nHe, then, to carry out his instructions, on March 26, called on the insured to reconcile Dr. Pratt's statement that the applicant's age was 65 years with the applicant's statement that it was 64.\nThe learned trial judge found as a fact that there had not been any wilful misrepresentation as to age, and that at this time, March 26, when Ferris called, the applicant was in good health. The learned judge says:\u2014\nI accept her statement that when Mr. Ferris called\u2014that is to say, on the 26th March\u2014her mother was in good health.\nMr. Ferris admitted that, in calling the plaintiff's attention to the alleged discrepancy between the age mentioned in the application and that reported by Dr. Pratt, she at once stated that her mother would be 65 on her next birthday. The agent and inspector of the company, Dr. King, who filled in the application, stated in his evidence that Mrs. Donovan had told him her age was 64 at that time, consequently she would be 65 on her next birthday, and the doctor had put her age for insurance purposes at 65, her next birthday.\nThese facts reconciled the apparent discrepancy, and Mr. Ferris, the provincial manager, then accepted from the plaintiff the $4.15 of additional premium, calculated on the age of 65, told her, after receiving it, that he would send back the policy to have the age and the premium corrected, and that, while it would be some days before he would receive it back, \"in the meantime everything was all right.\" In this both the plaintiff and Mr. Ferris, the manager, agree.\nHe did mail it back to the head office the same day, 26th March, and on April 4 he received a corrected policy in accordance with the age discrepancy he had \"reconciled.''\nAt that time, Mr. Ferris says that, because he had learned of the then illness of the assured, he did not hand over the policy to her. He said he knew that the premium had been paid and that the company had been informed of the payment.\nNow, with respect to the crucial point of the delivery of the policy, what is the proper inference to be drawn from the evidence as to whether the companys' provincial agent had ascertained\nthat Dr. Pratt's confidential report had been sent in and that it was satisfactory,\nand that he, the agent, had reconciled the age discrepancy? Surely, only one inference can be drawn. He \"presumed, he says, that he went to see Dr. Pratt\" before going to see the insured. He cannot remember whether he saw him or not. It was his duty to see him, and the fact that after \"he presumed he called upon Dr. Pratt\" he went to the insured, reconciled the age discrepancy question, recovered the excess premium of $4.15 from her required because the assured's next birthday would be 65, and, on being asked whether everything was all right now, replied that it was\u2014completes the necessary facts to enable a proper inference to be drawn from them.\nThe inference then and the only inference which can be drawn from these proved facts is that he had fully complied with his instructions as to Dr. Pratt's confidential report, and had subsequently satisfactorily \"reconciled\" the age discrepancy and then received the excess premium, and assured the plaintiff that everything was all right.\nIt seems to me from that moment the contract of assurance was complete, and that the company could have been compelled to issue a policy in accordance with it, and that, if the assured died in the meantime, there was a contract which the plaintiff, as beneficiary, could have enforced. The subsequent illness of the assured at the time when the rectified policy came back to the provincial agent, namely, the 4th April, could not operate to annul a completed contract. Manual delivery of the second or rectified policy was not essential to complete the contract. That was complete when the conditions contained in the letter from the general manager of March 18th had been complied with or at any rate when the new policy was executed and forwarded unconditionally from Toronto. The policy was merely the evidence of the contract.\nIt does not seem to me that the withholding of the manual delivery of the rectified policy from the assured by the provincial agent on April 4th, after he had unconditionally received it, because he heard the assured was then ill, could in any way operate to destroy or impair that completed contract.\nThe learned judges in the Court of Appeal for New Brunswick inclined to the view that the first policy did not represent a concluded and completed contract expressive of their true intentions between the parties.\nBut, apart from that they held and, as I understand their reasons, they based their judgment upon the fact that the condition (1) of the policy had not been complied with alike as to its delivery and the surrender of the official receipt. That condition reads:\u2014\nThis policy shall not take effect until the same has been delivered, the first premium paid thereon and the official receipt surrendered to the company during the lifetime and continued good health of the assured.\nI have already given, my reasons for holding that there was a legal delivery of the policy, if not when the first policy was forwarded to the provincial agent and the instructions enclosing it complied with, at any rate when the rectified and fully executed policy was posted from Toronto on the 1st or 2nd of April, directed to the provincial agent without any conditions as to its delivery. That unconditional forwarding of the policy to the provincial agent operated in law as a legal delivery from its posting. The agent says distinctly that he did not get any letter of instructions from the company with that policy. They simply enclosed the policy and the official receipt to him, and, as he heard the assured was ill, he returned both to the company, and did not hand them over to the assured. As to the full premium, that had been admittedly paid and received, and as to the \"surrender of the official receipt,\" there is not a particle of evidence that I can find shewing that any such official receipt ever was given to the assured which could be surrendered. On the contrary, there was merely a receipt for the monies paid given by the provincial agent, and it could not be contended and was not contended that such a receipt was in any sense an official receipt such as that referred to in condition (1), the official receipt there mentioned being, as I understand it, substantially an interim insurance issued by the head office and held by the assured until he receives his formal policy, and, when the latter is given him, the receipt is to be surrendered.\nIf no official receipt was given to the assured, and no one says it was, and there is no evidence from which it can be inferred it was, then it is plain that its \"surrender\" could not be required by the company before the policy attached and that part of condition (1) would not be applicable at all. It is surely plain and clear that the surrender up of the \"official receipt\" is only necessary in cases where such a receipt has been delivered. In this case there is no pretence that it was delivered.\nAs authority for this position taken by me, that there was a complete delivery of the corrected policy when, with full knowledge of the facts, it was executed by the officials of the head office in Toronto and mailed without conditions to their provincial agent in St. John, and, secondly, that, when received by that official, he had no power to cancel it, and that physical possession of the policy by the assured was not necessary to complete the contract, I rely not only upon the case already cited from this Court, but also upon the well-known case decided by the House of Lords, after having the opinions of the judges summoned before them, of Xenos v. Wickham[10].\nThe facts of that case, of course, are different from this, but the principles there laid down, it seems to me, govern this case. It was there held that\nA policy of insurance purported to be \"signed, sealed and delivered\" by two of the directors of an insurance company in the presence of their secretary, and according to the powers vested in the directors by the deed of settlement of the company. This statement was taken, as against the company, to be conclusive that it was not only duly signed and sealed, but also duly delivered.\nA policy \"signed, sealed and delivered\" is complete and binding as against the party executing it, though, in fact, it remains in his possession, unless there is some particular act required to be done by the other party to declare his adoption of it.\nThat case was decided in 1867. Then, again, in 1896, the case of Roberts v. Security Company[11] was decided by the Court of Appeal, affirming the decision of the Divisional Court.\nIt determined two points: First, that when there was no evidence of a conditional delivery and when the policy was executed by the directors of the company, the insurance became effective and constituted a completed contract of insurance; and, secondly, that by the recital therein the defendants had waived the condition for prepayment of the premium, and, therefore, the policy had attached. On the first point, the language of Lord Esher is in full accord with the decision of the House of Lords in Xenos v. Wickham[12], and admits of no doubt as to the law.\nThe learned trial judge suggests that this decision of Roberts v. Security Company11 had been questioned by the Privy Council in the appeal of Equitable Fire Office v. Ching Wo Hing[13], but a reference to the latter case shews clearly that the observation of Lord Davey, in delivering the opinion of the Judicial Committee, was confined solely to the second point decided in Roberts v. Security Co.11 as to the recital in the policy operating as a waiver, and had nothing to do with the first point decided that the execution of the policy by the directors constituted a complete contract, although the assured had not received physical delivery of the policy.\nThen there was the case of Canning v. Farquhar[14], where the Court of Appeal decided that, the nature of the risk having been altered at the time of the tender of the premium, there was no contract binding the company to issue a policy.\nBut in the case before us there is no pretence for saying that, when the premium was paid in full and accepted by the provincial agent, who then wrote to the company, and when the company, acting upon their agent's letter, executed the new or later policy, the nature of the risk had been altered. The learned trial judge, on this crucial point, as I have already pointed out, found the fact in plaintiff's favour.\nLord Esher, in that case of Canning v. Farquhar14, says, at p. 731:\u2014\nWhen does the contract of insurance commence? It commences at the time when the premium is offered.\nIf at that time the offer of the premium is accepted and there has been no change in the nature of the risk, the negotiations for a contract have matured and the contract is complete.\nThat I take to be the substance of the decision in Canning v. Farquhar14.\nThe text writers on the subject of insurance are, I think, quite in accord with what I have written as to the above several decisions which are binding upon us.\nThe grounds of my judgment for allowing this appeal are that there was no wilful misstatement of fact in the application for insurance by the deceased; that the first policy sent to the assured by the company had been sent for delivery conditionally; that the two conditions, the seeing to the confidential report of Dr. Pratt and the \"reconcilement\" of the discrepancy between the ages of the assured as stated by her and that stated by Dr. Pratt, had been effected; that at the time the assured \"was in good health,\" and the trial judge so found the facts; that the company had been informed by its agent of the true facts and of the payment to its agent of the full premium based upon the age of 65, and had then (2nd April, 1912), with full knowledge of all material facts, executed the seconder corrected policy and mailed it to the agent without any conditions attached; that the contract of insurance was, if not before, then at least fully completed, and that there was no power on the part of the agent, on his receipt of the policy without conditions and simply on his then hearing of a change in the health of the assured, to withhold the policy or to attempt to cancel a completed contract.\nI am, therefore, of opinion that the appeal should be allowed and judgment entered for the plaintiff for the amount of the policy executed by the company and mailed from Toronto to its provincial agent in St. John on the 2nd day of April, 1912, $1,000, with interest from the due date of that policy, and costs in all the courts.\nIdington J.\u2014The findings of fact by the learned trial judge and maintained by the Court of Appeal have reduced anything involved in this appeal to the bare question of law relative to the delivery of the policy in question. The delivery of the first policy can certainly not be maintained as complete in face of the terms of the letter of March 18th, 1912, by the general manager to the provincial manager. If the conditions set forth in that communication had been complied with, then it would be fairly arguable that the company had intended to deliver the policy. If, for example, the provincial manager had been able to reconcile Dr. Pratt's statement that the applicant was 65 with the fact that the applicant had given her age as 64, there would have been much in favour of the appellant's contention. Inasmuch as it was impossible to reconcile these statements, it would seem to have been his obvious duty to return the policy as he did. There is, however, a statement in the application which must be taken to be the basis of the concensus of mind between the parties and to govern the question involved herein relative to the delivery. The application reads thus:\u2014\nThat any policy which may be issued under the application shall not be in force until the same be delivered and until the actual payment to and acceptance of the premium by said company, or its authorized \"agent, in accordance with the company's rules, during my lifetime and continued good health, and said premium shall then be considered to have been paid and the insurance to have been begun at the due date named in the policy.\nIn pursuance thereof it is competent for the company to define the mode of delivery by which it is to be bound.\nThe first condition of the policy provides:\u2014\n1. When Policy in Force.\u2014This policy shall not take effect until the same has been delivered, the first premium thereon paid and the official receipt surrendered to the company during the lifetime and continued good health of the assured.\nIt seems to me impossible within the language of that condition to hold that it had been the intention of the company to deliver, or be held as having delivered, any policy unless and until the condition had been complied with.\nAs the policy and official receipt for the premium were not dealt with within the terms of the said condition, the company cannot, I think, be held bound.\nTo hold otherwise would seem to conflict with the supreme rule, relative to the common purpose or intention of the parties thereto, which must govern this and every other contract.\nThe courts in both the cases of Roberts v. Security Co.[15] and the North American Life Ins. Co. v. Elson[16], so much relied upon by appellant, observed, or intended to observe, that rule, and only decided that, after fully assenting to an insurance contract, the insurer could not recede.\nThis company, now respondent herein, would seem to have taken special pains to avoid any misunderstanding by courts of its intention, though it may thereby have misled others.\nI think the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014There was no delivery of the first policy of insurance\u2014that sued upon. By a condition of the application, delivery of the policy was made a prerequisite of the creation of contractual liability. The present case is in several particulars distinguishable from North American Life Ins. Co. v. Elson16, relied on by the appellant, notably in that in the case now at bar the policy was sent to the company's agent not for unconditional delivery, as in the Elson Case (2), but to be delivered only upon conditions stated in the letter from the company to their agent referring to it. Instead of delivery being made when the agent called at the applicant's residence on the 26th of March, he became satisfied that there had been a misstatement of the age of the applicant\u2014one of the matters subject to which the policy had been forwarded mentioned in the company's letter. He appears to have explained to the applicant's daughter (the plaintiff in this action), with whom he dealt on her mother's behalf, the effect which the difference between the age stated in the policy and the actual age of the applicant would have upon the amount that would be payable under the policy, and also to have informed her that for a slight additional premium a policy could be obtained which would entitle the beneficiaries to the full amount of the insurance. Thereupon it was determined that such a policy should be taken rather than the policy which the company had sent to the agent, and the policy so sent was accordingly returned by the agent to the company at Toronto with the additional amount of premium which he had obtained from the applicant's daughter. A second policy of insurance was thereupon prepared and forwarded to the agent, but it was not delivered by him because he learned that the insured was ill. The evidence clearly establishes that when the agent visited the house of the insured on the 26th of March for the purpose of discussing the difficulty arising out of the misstatement of age in the application for the first policy, the applicant had already become ill. She never recovered and died on the 7th of April. Her daughter deposes that she had been continuously ill for about three or four weeks before her death, and there is no contradiction of this evidence. In face of it, the finding of the learned trial judge that the plaintiff's mother was in good health on the 26th of March is somewhat difficult to understand. The application made continued good health of the insured at the time of payment and acceptance of the premium a condition of the policy coming into force. The conclusion, therefore, seems inevitable that the risk never attached, and that the judgment dismissing the plaintiff's action is correct and must be affirmed.\nBrodeur J.\u2014This is an action concerning a contract of insurance instituted in the following circumstances :\u2014\nIn the month of March, 1912, the plaintiff's mother, Mrs. Donovan, expressed her wish to the agent of the respondent company to take a life insurance policy for $1,000: As she was then 64 years of age, the agent, however, would not receive the application before conferring with the company. He came back to Mrs. Donovan's residence a few days after, and an application was made for a policy.\nShe did not know how to read and write at all; the necessary answers were written by the agent. She declared that she was 64 years of age, and the agent, instead of entering 65 as being her next birthday, as required by the printed form, inserted by mistake 64, and received the payment as based upon the age of 64.\nWhen she was examined by the doctor she must have made the same declaration about her age, but the doctor properly entered 65 as being her next birthday.\nThe policy was issued by the company and sent to the provincial manager in St. John, N.B. He was advised, however, that before delivering the policy he should\nalso reconcile Dr. Pratt's statement that the applicant is sixty-five, whereas the applicant herself gives her age as sixty-four. In a case of this kind, in future, in view of the age, it is best that proof of age be submitted with a view of the same being admitted on the policy.\nOn the 26th of March the provincial manager called at the home of the assured with the policy, and the following occurred, as told by the plaintiff:\u2014 Q. Mr. Ferris came to the shop, did he?\nA. Yes.\nQ. You saw him personally?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Just tell us what took place, what he said to you?\nA. He said he brought the policy and he opened it and he told me it was for $800; there was a mistake of one year in the age.\nQ. Did he say this?\nA. Yes, he said that. So he said to secure the other $200, to pay a few more dollars, and that would make the thousand; so he took away the policy and said it would be nine or ten days before the other would come back, but in the meantime that it was all right.\nQ. What did you do when he said that?\nA. I gave him the balance.\nQ. How much?\nA. I gave him a five-dollar bill and he gave me some change back.\nQ. You gave him what he asked?\nA. Yes, I gave him what he asked.\nQ. What did he say then?\nA, He said it might be nine or ten days before the policy would came back, but in the meantime everything was all right; that was all the conversation.\nAt that time the insured was in good health. Unfortunately, she took sick a few days after, and she died on the 7th of April.\nIn the meantime the policy was sent back to Toronto to be modified or to have a new one issued and a new one was issued on the 1st of April. When the agent received it, he did not make the delivery immediately, because he heard that the insured was sick, and after her death he went and offered to return the money.\nThe question is whether the plaintiff, in those circumstances, as a beneficiary under the policy of insurance, would be entitled to recover.\nIn the policy it was provided that, in order that a policy should be binding, it should be delivered. It is contended by the respondent that there was no delivery in the present case, and that, consequently, the contract was not binding. It was decided in the case of North American Life Assurance Co. v. Elson[17] that an insurance policy having been sent from Toronto on the 27th September to the company's agent at Winnipeg and forwarded by him on October 1st to the insured, that the contract of insurance was complete; that the policy and receipt were delivered when the papers were mailed at Toronto on the 27th September.\nIt was contended in this case that the policy was binding, and, relying on that judgment in the case of Elson17, that the policy was duly delivered when it was mailed from Toronto. But the instructions given by the company to their provincial manager in New Brunswick not to deliver the policy until he would have reconciled the different ages given by the agent and by the doctor may and must affect the case and lead me to distinguish this case from the Elson Case (1).\nBut when the facts had been ascertained by the provincial manager of the respondent and when he goes to the insured with the policy and when the facts and circumstances reported above have taken place, can it be said that there was actual delivery?\nI am inclined to answer that question in the affirmative.\nConstructive delivery has taken place. It is true that the policy had been given back to the manager to have another one issued for a larger amount, but there was, according to my opinion, a binding contract, which bound the respondent company for at least $800. The representations with regard to the age of the insured are not sufficient to invalidate the contract, because it was formally stated that if some errors happen with regard to the age, the amount of the policy or the premiums varied.\nI have come to the conclusion that there was a binding contract for $800, and that the judgment of the courts below dismissing appellant's action should be reversed.\nThe appeal should be allowed, with costs of this court and of the courts below.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Daniel Mullin.\nSolicitor for the respondents: Fred.

Brown (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1916: May 31; 1916: June 24.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies, Idington, Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ONTARIO.\nDebtor and creditor\u2014Surety\u2014Statute of Frauds\u2014Advances to company\u2014Third party\u2019s promise to repay.\nB., a director of a mining company, advanced money for the company\u2019s purposes, which G., the president and largest shareholder, orally agreed to repay.\nHeld, affirming the decision of the Appellate Division (35 Ont. L.R. 218), which reversed the judgment for the defendant at the trial (34 Ont. L.R. 210), Fitzpatrick, C.J., and Idington J. dissenting, that this was not a promise to pay a debt of the company and void as a contract by virtue of the fourth section of the Statute of Frauds; that G. was a primary debtor for the monies advanced by B. and liable to the latter for their re-payment.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario, Brown v. Coleman Development Co.[1], reversing the judgment at the trial[2] in favour of the defendant.\nThe action in this, case was brought against the appellant and the Coleman Development Co. to recover monies advanced by respondent for the company\u2019s operations, which, he alleges, appellant promised to repay. It was referred to a referee, who found that the promise of repayment was made, and gave judgment against the appellant and for the company. On appeal, Mr. Justice Middleton accepted the findings of fact by the referee, but reversed his judgment on the ground that the appellant\u2019s agreement was one to answer for the debt of the company and void under the Statute of Frauds. He gave judgment against the company, and dismissed the action against appellant. The Appellate Division restored the judgment of the referee.\nTilley K.C. and H.S. White for the appellant.\nMcCullough for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting).\u2014It has been assumed that this case is concluded by the authority of decided cases, of which Lakeman v. Mountstephen[3] is a leading case. I think that is far from correct. All that was before the House of Lords, in that case, was the question whether there was evidence to go to the jury. Per Lord O\u2019Hagan:\u2014\nOur judgment proceeds merely on the ground that there was evidence to go to the jury.\nIn the present case, whilst fully admitting that there was evidence on which it was possible for the referee to find a primary liability of the appellant, this court has also to consider whether the facts establish such liability.\nAlthough this court is reluctant to disturb findings of fact arrived at in the courts of original jurisdiction, yet this rule calls for a less strict observance where the finding is not of a judge or a jury, but a referee, whose decision may not command so much confidence. In the present case, moreover, the finding of the so-called fact is, in reality, rather an inference from the facts.\nI am far from satisfied that the evidence shews an original primary liability of the appellant to the respondent, but there is more than this. Lord Selborne, in the case above-mentioned, when laying down that there can be no suretyship unless there be a principal debtor, adds:\u2014\nWho, of course, may be constituted in the course of the transaction by matters ex post facto and need not be so at the time.\nIn my view, the evidence does not support the conclusion arrived at below, and I would allow the appeal with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014The sole question in this case is whether the contract made between Brown and Gillies for the advances made by the former to the Coleman Development Company was one which involved a personal liability on Gillies\u2019 part, and, if it did, whether it came within the Statute of Frauds and was a promise to pay the debt of the company.\nMr. Tilley\u2019s argument was that the subsequent transactions with the company shewed that the contention as to Brown being a primary debtor was incorrect and, in fact, impossible.\nI am unable to accept that contention, and think these subsequent transactions are quite consistent with Gillies\u2019 primary liability for the monies advanced by Brown. I agree with the Second Appellate Division in its conclusion as to the law on the proved facts. The findings of fact of the referee were accepted by Mr. Justice Middleton, who determined, however, against Gillies\u2019 primary liability.\nGillies\u2019 promise to Brown was, in effect: If you advance these monies to pay the accruing liabilities of the company, which I had agreed to do, but find myself at present unable to do, I will return them to you. It matters not that the monies advanced were for the advantage of the company. I think both parties fully understood that Gillies was the primary debtor to whom Brown looked for payment, and that the evidence shews this to be so.\nIt does not seem to me that the Statute of Frauds applies at all to a case such as this. That statute applies only to cases where the promise is made to the creditor or person to whom the debt is owing. A promise to a debtor to pay his debt is not within the statute. Eastwood v. Kenyon[4], in 1840.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting)\u2014This action brought by respondent Brown, as plaintiff, against appellant Gillies and the Coleman Development Company, was referred to the late Mr. Kappelle as official referee, and, after he had heard the evidence for plaintiff and part of that for the defence and died, the continuation of the reference was transferred to Mr. Cameron as official referee.\nHis report maintaining respondent\u2019s claim was reversed by Mr. Justice Middleton, and, on appeal, the report of the referee was restored.\nThe question of law raised is whether or not the contract, if any, between appellant and respondent falls within the Statute of Frauds, section 4.\nIn order to appreciate properly the facts, which one must have an accurate conception of in such cases in order to apply the law, I read the respondent\u2019s evidence, and found myself, from the peculiarities I found therein, compelled to read and consider the entire evidence in the case.\nIt is, unfortunately, by reason of the death of the learned referee, one of those cases where we cannot, as I conceive, rest satisfied with findings of fact, so far as dependent upon the relative credibility of the parties, by the judge upon whom it has devolved to finish a half-tried case. This is not the first of that kind to come here. He is in little, if any, better position than we when re-hearing trials upon mere depositions. Indeed, he may, in a sense, sometimes be in a worse, in case those coming before him happen to be possessed of a demeanour to impress him favourably.\nThe appellant was the owner of some mining claims and promoted the incorporation of the defendant company; became, and continued throughout, its president and possessor of $200,000 face value of its stock, as the price of conveying his claims to the company, and, later, acquired a very large number of shares to recoup him for advances to develop the property, and the solicitor who procured the charter was assigned stock in the way of compensation for his services, and became one of the directors.\nOthers seem to have taken merely the necessary stock to qualify them as directors, and a purchase by respondent from appellant, in the spring of 1906, of 500 shares left the appellant more deeply interested than all the rest combined in the success of the company.\nBy reason of his falling ill in July, 1906, and being unable for a time to look after the business, the solicitor suggested engaging respondent at ten dollars a day for two days in each week, and to this appellant assented.\nHe was engaged accordingly, and soon became also the secretary and a director of the company, which position he held during all the time we are concerned to know anything of their affairs.\nHe presented an account of $192\u2014substantially\u2014 for services, at a meeting in July, 1906, and took payment in shares at 25c. a share.\nOn the 29th October, 1906, he presented another account for $800, and accepted payment in shares issued on same basis.\nHe would seem thus to have become a shareholder of a greater number of shares than any other person besides appellant.\nHis present claim rests upon an alleged conversation had in December, 1906, and the construction put thereupon.\nHis evidence is as follows:\u2014\n98. Q.\u2014When did you commence advancing monies? A.\u2014Along in December.\n99. Q.\u2014Of what year? A.\u2014The fall of 1906.\n100. Q.\u2014How did you come to make those advances? A.\u2014Mr. Gillies\u2019 money had run short, and he didn\u2019t want to discontinue the operations and have the company die out. He wanted to keep working, and he told me that if I would advance this money and keep the thing alive, that he had monies coming in and he would return it to me.\n101. Q.\u2014When you say \u201cadvanced\u201d this money\u2014what money? A.\u2014Money to the workmen or to keep the operations of the company going. There were supplies and wages.\n102. Q.\u2014When do you say that arrangement was made? A.\u2014Prior to the payment of this 4th December to William Hill.\n103. Q.\u2014Well, did you agree to that? A.\u2014Yes, I agreed to it.\nEither this story is true or false. It is unsupported by anything that can properly be called corroboration. It is absolutely denied by the appellant.\nA perusal of the entire evidence leaves a most unpleasant impression as to each as a witness. The respondent, notwithstanding what he would have the court believe as to this bargain with appellant in December, 1906, presented, at a meeting 22nd January, 1907, an account for $2,800, admittedly comprising advances of the character he had just bargained so recently to look to appellant for repayment of.\nIf his story is true, then he had no right to render this account to the company, so far as it embraces items for advances. His doing so tends to destroy belief in his story and helps us to credit appellant in his denial.\nBut what could he expect in way of repayment? He knew the company had no cash. And less than two months had elapsed since, if his story is to be believed in the sense he now asks the court to accept and act upon it, he was to look to appellant alone.\nIn presenting the account to the company, we hear nothing from him but a demand for stock at 25c. on the dollar, although believed by those at that meeting, including himself, to be worth par or perhaps twice its face value. He did not, when appellant resisted him, there turn round and demand the repayment from him of the money advanced. Why? Can there be a doubt in the mind of any one reading his evidence that he much preferred stock at 25c.?\nPassing these men for the moment, there was in the person of the solicitor, also a director, another witness. He is one of repute and standing, whose veracity has not been questioned, and his version of what transpired does not agree with that of the respondent. And he denies the adoption of a resolution, whilst he was present, which is found afterwards written up in the minute book by the respondent in the following terms:\u2014\nResolution passed by the Directors of The Coleman Development Company, Limited, on the 22nd day of January, 1907, at 9.30 p.m.\nPresent:\u2014\nJames F. Gillies.\nN.B. Brown.\nJohn McKay.\nMoved, seconded and resolved, that the account of N.B. Brown, amounting to the sum of twenty-eight hundred dollars, be paid by essuing stock at twenty-five cents per share amounting to eleven thousand two hundred paid-up shares, and the same is issued.\nCarried\nJAMES F. GILLIES, President.\nN.B. BROWN, Secy. The appellant denies this, but has to admit his signature thereto. And counsel asks us to look at these signatures in the minute book and find, what he contends, that all appellant\u2019s signatures to a series of minutes were written at one time with the same pen and ink.\nI did not hear this challenged as fact in argument, and, without posing as an expert, I may say it is to be regretted the point was not developed by expert testimony.\nWhatever may be the facts, there is certainly a curious appearance in this alleged resolution, in which I take the liberty above of making the spelling conform with the signed minute instead of that in the printed case.\nThe sequel to this alleged resolution is also curious.\nNo stock certificates were issued until the following August, and then as of course by the respondent.\nAssuming for the moment this only an accident and the resolution quite regular, if these two parties could manufacture wealth in that manner, why should the appellant not look to the company? Why should he pick out a man likely only, if paying personally, to pay only dollar for dollar, and let go the chance of multiplying wealth by an issue of stock?\nThe attitude of mind of the respondent Brown towards this company and its stock is illustrated by the following letter:\u2014\nHaileybury, Ont.,\nMarch 10, 1907.\nMr. John McKay, Soo.\nDear Sir,\u2014Your favour of the 8th inst. to hand, and, in reply, beg to say that, so far as I am concerned, I have no objection whatever to your selling your stock at $1.75. I would not like to see it put on here for less than 2.00, as a great many of the holders of it here have paid two and up as high as 2.60, the party who would be buying your stock would, in all probability, hold it at 2.00 or better\u2014in that event there could be no harm done the holders here, as they are all pretty well satisfied it will yet make them some money. Mr. Gillies has ordered a compressor plant, and when it is installed, which will be in the course of a couple of months, together with the depth we will be then on the big vein, I think the stock should sell at 5.00, they are down on the big vein about 10 to 12 ft. from where they are sinking to where the find was made it is as straight as a gun shot through that swamp the vein where they are sinking is about as wide but has not metal in it of course it is perhaps twenty feet higher than where it was first found. Mr. Gillies is in Toronto, has been sick I believe. I am expecting him back every day; you did not say if you got the bag of ore samples which I sent you.\nYours truly,\nN.B. BROWN.\nWhen brought face to face with this letter, he says he did not believe what he asserts therein.\nI prefer to believe his letter to his frail memory.\nAnd in that letter, read in light of the minutes of that January meeting, I can easily understand why a man, acting as the respondent did in relation thereto and holding such high hopes of the stock, should prefer looking to the company to recoup his advances by issues of stock at 25c. on the dollar, to charging up his advances dollar for dollar against appellant, whose possible means of repayment may have been dependent on same source.\nBetter an investment that might multiply ten or twenty times than one that could yield only five per centum per annum.\nHe has chosen to put his own interpretation upon the meaning of the conversation I have quoted by his own acts.\nIt seems to me the circumstance of the sending of an account by the plaintiff in the case of Lakeman v. Mountstephen[5], in 1874, had not by any means the same force as I think should be given here. I need not dwell on the attendant circumstances there. After all, that case had been submitted to a jury, and, as Lord Cairns presents the matter, all that was really involved in that case was whether or not there was evidence which should be submitted to a jury, and the jury had found for the plaintiff. I think Mr. Justice Middleton was right in the conclusion he reached, and that his judgment should be restored.\nIn all these cases the question is really one of fact, and, these once correctly appreciated and comprehended, there is not much difficulty in the law.\nThere is not much doubt in my mind but that, resting not on the alleged conversation of December, 1906, but upon what transpired between these parties later, the appellant owed the respondent in respect of some of the later advances, but the case has not been so developed as to enable any one to determine the exact truth and found a judgment thereon.\nMrs. Brown\u2019s evidence indicates and perhaps corroborates such a view. Beyond that her evidence cannot be stretched. The notes and cheques referred to by the parties needed some explanation by credible witnesses, who, no doubt, could have been got to render that part of the story intelligible and susceptible of judicial determination.\nThe memorandum of release signed by the parties suggests as much, but is far from furnishing proof of an indebtedness by appellant to the extent of $7,000.\nIt is the combined indebtedness of the company and of appellant that is therein dealt with.\nThat document, so far from being corroborative of the respondent\u2019s story and claim, seems to me destructive thereof.\nThe appellant certainly admits by it owing something for himself, but both parties clearly admit the company owed something as well as the appellant. And, whatever each owed respondent, he agreed both together should be discharged for the sum of $7,000.\nAccording to the contention now set up by respondent, the company owed him nothing. He had no contractual relations with them involved in the matters thus disposed of.\nBut it may be said his wages were intended. They were already obliterated.\nI think the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of Mr. Justice Middleton restored.\nANGLIN J.\u2014It has been held by an official referee acting as trial judge in this action, by Mr. Justice Middleton on appeal, and again, on a further appeal, by the four judges who constituted the Appellate Division, that the defendant made a promise of some sort to repay the monies advanced by the plaintiff to the Coleman Development Company. That finding is sufficiently supported by evidence, and the appeal against it is hopeless.\nThe only difference of opinion in the provincial courts was that, while it was the view of the official referee and of the learned judges of the Appellate Division that Gillies\u2019 promise was absolute and that of a primary debtor, Mr. Justice Middleton held that\nThe promise made by Gillies was, in truth, a promise to answer for the debt of the company. * * * I think the true finding of fact ought to be that the company became debtor,\nand he discharged Gillies under the fourth section of the Statute of Frauds.\nGillies absolutely denied any promise whatever. His denial was not accepted. The only version of the oral contract is that of Brown, who says that\nHe (Gillies) told me that if I would advance this money and keep the thing alive, that he had moneys coming in and that he would return it to me. There is no direct evidence of any undertaking of liability by the company, although there is no doubt that the moneys were advanced for its benefit. Upon this evidence I agree with the learned judges of the Appellate Division that a case of direct and primary liability on the part of Gillies is made out.\nThere were, no doubt, a number of circumstances. as Mr. Justice Middleton points out, which afford somewhat cogent evidence that there was some sort of understanding that Brown would be paid by the company\u2014the facts that accounts were rendered by him to the company covering both wages (for which its liability is admitted) and the advances which he claims Gillies promised to repay, and that the present action was brought against the company as well as Gillies. On the other hand, the plaintiff\u2019s particulars clearly distinguish between the two claims, and, in a document evidencing a settlement of the amount of Brown\u2019s claim at $7,000, Gillies authorized payment of that sum by one Cartwright, who held an option on Gillies\u2019 shares in the company.\nAlthough the evidence in chief given by Brown was heard before another officer since deceased, Gillies\u2019 evidence and Brown\u2019s evidence in rebuttal were heard by the learned referee who gave the judgment, and who thus had an opportunity of observing the demeanour of both parties as witnesses. A careful study of the evidence in the light of the argument has not convinced me that the conclusion reached by the referee and unanimously affirmed on appeal by the Appellate Division, that the defendant became the primary and direct debtor of the plaintiff, is so clearly erroneous that it should be disturbed in this court. While I have little doubt that it was expected that in some way the monies advanced by Brown would be obtained from the company\u2014and, had its affairs pros- pered, that would in all probability have happened\u2014I cannot find in the record any evidence which establishes that it ever incurred legal liability to him.\nThe appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014This action had been brought to recover payment of advances made by the respondent, Brown, against the Coleman Development Company and the appellant, Gillies. His action was dismissed with regard to the company, but was maintained against the appellant.\nThe issue of fact was whether the defendant, Gillies, had agreed to reimburse those advances.\nA long enqu\u00eate has taken place, and it was found that the promise to pay, alleged by the plaintiff, was proved. The defendant now claims that his contract with the plaintiff was a contract of suretyship and not a direct obligation to pay.\nI have perused the evidence in that regard, and I am unable to find that the facts disclosed shew that Gillies became the surety of the Coleman Development Company. He simply agreed to pay those advances.\nIt is true that Brown was in the employ of the mining company and that his salary was paid by the latter by way of issue of stock; but it is true equally that some advances previously made to the mining company by Brown were paid also in the same way. But, when large advances were to be made, it was agreed with the appellant, Gillies, that he would reimburse those advances. It was a personal and direct liability on his part, and he cannot now invoke the Statute of Frauds to prevent him from being liable under that contract.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: A.G.

Saunders K.C. for the appellant.\nR.C.H. Cassels for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The appellant sued upon a contract contained in a telegram in the following words:\u2014\nToronto, Ont., Nov. 21st, 1913.\nThe Cashier Pioneer Bank, Porterville, Cal.\nWe guarantee payment of drafts on J.J. McCabe with bills lading attached not exceeding in all sixteen hundred and twenty-nine 70\/100 dollars covering two cars oranges containing 396 boxes each in P.F.E. 8304 and P.F.E. 11914.\nThe bills of lading attached to the draft shew that the goods were consigned by the vendors, \u201cMutual Orange Distributors,\u201d to themselves and on the face of the bills appears:\u2014\nNote on Waybill.\u2014Permit inspection without bill of lading. Deliver without bill of lading on order of Mutual Orange Distributors\u2019 Agent.\nThe contract is short, and, as I think, simple; indeed if it were not for the introduction into the case of matters foreign to it, there would not seem to be much room for difficulty. It cannot, I think, matter what were the motives of McCabe, the purchaser, in refusing to accept the goods; all that we have to consider is whether the conditions of the contract were fulfilled so as to render the guarantee binding.\nA bill of lading is not a thing of little known or uncertain character; on the contrary, it is in everyday use and to a very wide extent in commercial transactions. I should suppose it would be difficult to find any business man who would consider that the bills of lading attached to a draft were such as the respondent intended and had a right to expect. They carried no title to the goods as is proved, if proof were needed, by the fact that the vendors were able properly to, and did actually, divert one of the cars in transit. The appellant indeed can only support these bills by alleging some rather dubious customs of the fruit trade in California. I think the true explanation is that, as frequently happens in the conduct of business of every description, matters were dealt with in the most convenient and practical rather than strictly regular way. In the vast majority of cases, particularly when the parties are known to each other, such a course of dealing leads to no trouble; when it does, however, and it becomes necessary to resort to the courts to settle disputes that have arisen, it is only legal rights that can be considered. Mr. Hicks, the vendor\u2019s agent, says, in his evidence, that the bills of lading need not necessarily have been made out to J.J. McCabe\nbecause I knew that I was dealing with a reputable concern in the Mutual Orange Distributors, and I knew that they would not take McCabe\u2019s money and not deliver to him what I had bought for him.\nAn express and vital condition of the contract was not complied with and the obligation under the contract never attached.\nIt is unnecessary for me to add that if in this suit the issue was between McCabe and his agent in California I would in all respects agree with the trial judge; because I fear that in last analysis McCabe may be the party benefited by this judgment I most reluctantly agree that this appeal be dismissed with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Anglin.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting)\u2014The appellant, being bankers in California, sued the respondent upon the following guarantee:\u2014 Toronto, Ont., Nov. 21st, 1913.\nThe Cashier, Pioneer Bank, Porterville, Cal.\nWe guarantee payment of drafts on J.J. McCabe with bills of lading attached not exceeding in all $1, 629. 70\/100 covering two cars oranges containing 396 boxes each in P.F.E. 8304 and P.F.E. 11914.\n(Sgd.) THE CANADIAN BANK OF COMMERCE.\nMarket Branch.\n1. 04 p. m.\nThis was given at the request of McCabe named therein and a dealer in such goods as specified; and was confirmed by a letter of same date signed and countersigned respectively, on behalf of respondent, by its acting manager and accountant.\nThe appellant relying thereon discounted a draft of one Hicks upon McCabe for the sum of $1,629. 70 and complied literally with the condition in the guarantee by annexing the bills of lading to the draft.\nThe learned trial judge held that in doing so appellant, under the circumstances in question, had done all that was required of it to demand the observance of respondent\u2019s obligation.\nBoth he and the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario recognize to the fullest extent the obvious facts that not only could the respondent bank or McCabe have got the two car loads of goods in question, if McCabe had so desired, but also that under the facts and circumstances there was no one else than McCabe or it, claiming or entitled to claim the goods in question.\nI am, I respectfully submit, unable to understand how or why under such circumstances the Appellate Division can interpose in the terms of the guarantee a condition which is not expressed therein.\nIt is idle to suggest that sometimes and for argument\u2019s sake I will admit usually bills of lading of a certain class are made to so read that a delivery of the goods by the carrier shall be made to the shipper, or according to, and in compliance with, an order endorsed thereon. What has that to do with the real question? A bill of lading might be made to read, as it has been, to deliver to the bearer (See Scrutton on Charterparties and Bills of Lading, art. 56, p. 154 of 7th ed.) and then in such a case would the court insist that doing so was all wrong and should not be permitted? Are business men to be bound to follow and observe the notions of judges and courts as to how they should conduct their business and communicate to and with each other their understanding of what they intend? Or must not courts rather try to understand what men of business are about and see that their common purposes are fully and fairly executed, no matter how foreign the methods adopted may be to the ways in which the courts might desire to see them travel?\nIndeed, in this very case, the bill of lading, which is the standard approved by the Interstate Commission and substantially adopted by our own Railway Commission, is headed \u201cnon\u2011negotiable\u201d.\nYet I have no doubt that the goods were deliverable to the owner, whomsoever he might be, at the point of destination.\nThe method in use is shewn to be, to name a consignee and to let his directions be obeyed. To facilitate this business method a direction is given which all concerned and properly instructed in regard thereto understand the meaning of. That is to name someone at the point of destination to be notified. Such party, if nothing intervenes to create a conflicting right, gets, as of course, the goods. In this case the matter is disposed of on the face of the bill thus:\u2014\nConsigned to Mutual Orange Distributors. Notify J.J. McCabe. And we are told the way bill was made so clearly in conformity with this method, that when one Moore, a local agent of the consignee, by mistake sought to divert one of the cars at Hamilton, he was called up on the phone by the railway company\u2019s agent at Hamilton and told that the direction as to that car was to notify J.J. McCabe at Toronto. Immediately he called on McCabe and asked him if those were his cars and was answered in the affirmative. McCabe himself had also been phoning to Hamilton to have one of these cars, then there on its transit towards Toronto, diverted there for a possible purchaser.\nIt seems this accidental circumstance of Moore\u2019s ineffectual attempt, led McCabe to inquire further. And, as the market was falling, when he learned the form of the bills of lading, he fancied he saw a dishonest means of escape from his obligations. Accordingly, without inquiry as to the real nature and effect of such form of bill of lading, he at once saw fit, without asking to see the bills of lading annexed to the draft, or the draft itself, which indeed had not yet been presented, to repudiate, and induce the respondent to repudiate, its obligations.\nBoth wired accordingly such repudiations to California; without waiting for presentations of the draft, or once attempting to get delivery of the cars by accepting the draft, getting the bills of lading and taking delivery of the cars, which beyond a shadow of doubt would have been accorded him, as the courts below both find. To maintain such a course of dealing seems to me to put a premium upon dishonesty.\nBills of lading and their indorsement, or want of endorsement, give rise to many questions, often difficult of solution, where there are conflicting claims to the property in the goods, or disputes involving something of that nature. But this case is entirely free from any of such embarrassments. It turns, or should turn, upon the obligations of respondent in guaranteeing and representing McCabe and enjoying whatever rights he might have, yet subject to the due observance of such obligations as rested upon him.\nIt is therefore well that we should appreciate exactly what these rights and obligations of McCabe were.\nHe was in communication with one Hicks, a broker at Potterville in California, and induced him as such broker to buy for him, McCabe, for shipment to Toronto, the two car-loads of oranges in question. Hicks on his behalf bought these two car-loads of oranges from the Mutual Orange Distributors, and, the bargain made, they loaded the cars accordingly, and to expedite the business started them on their way, consigned, as they had a right to do, to themselves, till the price paid. The need of getting this guarantee, before the appellant would advance the money to pay the price, took a day or two, I imagine. Be that as it may, the appellant advanced the money and the full price (less brokerage charges to pay Hicks) was paid the Mutual Orange Distributors, who thenceforward had no claim or possibility of claim on the goods.\nTheir right ceased thenceforth to divert or order any other delivery than to McCabe or any one, such as the bank, possessing the bills of lading.\nIt is idle therefore to point to the original memo at the foot of each of the bills of lading as having longer effect on the destination of the goods.\nEven the carriers, having notice of the facts, could no longer take any orders from such consignors or consignees. No one else than McCabe had any rights in the premises saving only the bank holding the bills of lading, and them only, until he accepted the draft, when the appellant became bound to surrender to him the bill of lading, and entitled to look only to such acceptance and the guarantee of respondent.\nWhen the draft was presented he refused instead of accepting it.\nWhen the railway company tendered him the remaining car left after his interference with the other at Hamilton he refused that also.\nThe railway company upon delivery to it by McCabe, of the bills of lading without any indorsement by anyone, was bound upon payment of their freight to deliver to McCabe the goods which then and thereby should have become his property.\nAs I read the documents and the evidence and the law upon the subject as laid down in decided cases, that was his right. I respectfully submit it needed no telegraphing, as suggested by the learned trial judge, to reach that result. Nothing was needed but a straightforward honest and usual course to be pursued by McCabe in order to reap the fruits of the work of himself and of his own agent, for that was all that Hicks was in the premises.\nThe Mutual Orange Distributors never intended by taking the bills of lading in the form they did to assert or retain any property in the goods beyond the time needed for McCabe\u2019s own agent arranging to get the cash from the bank and pay them, and their surrender of the bills under such circumstances needed no endorsement of the bills.\nSomething was suggested in argument as flowing from what Moore, an agent of the vendors, had said. He had said, though he was not asked to do so, that he would give no order. It was urged that this supported respondent and McCabe\u2019s positions.\nI interpret that incident as of quite the contrary effect. Moore had no more authority than any one else to interfere and it needed no help from him or his principals under the circumstances, as he well knew, to enable McCabe to get the goods.\nI have not the time at my disposal to enter upon a long exposition of the law, but those desiring to find it can do so by reading the chapter in Scrutton\u2019s work, already cited, on the effect of endorsement and the cases therein referred to and the chapter in Leggett on Bills of Lading, part 4, pp. 611 et seq., the case of Mirabita v. The Imperial Ottoman Bank[2] and Benjamin on Sales, 5th ed., pp. 380 et seq., and pp. 395 and 396.\nThe peculiar facts of this case, including Hick\u2019s agency and the non-negotiable nature of the bill of lading and the intention of the parties, which must always be borne in mind, render it impossible to accept literally judicial dicta based on an entirely different sort of bill of lading and other purposes than evident herein.\nI do not think if one reaches a correct view of the facts there need be much puzzling over the law.\nHicks swears he has handled during six seasons of such dealing from five hundred to a thousand cars a season and in seventy-five per cent. of the cases of shipment he had substantially acted as he did in this case and no difficulty had arisen in any one of them by reason of so doing.\nI believe him. Business men and carriers find the honest simple course the best and that course pursued by such men in California, where McCabe tried to do business and initiated this transaction, binds him.\nThe \u201cBanking Act\u201d I incline to think would have protected respondent if it had advanced the money and taken delivery of the bills of lading as they were presented. See sec. 87, sub\u2011sec. 2.\nAlthough having suggested that in the course of the argument as worth looking at I have not had time to form a definite opinion and express none.\nThe reasoning in the case of Saunders Bros. v. Maclean[3], properly applied, supports the appellant instead of respondent for whom it was cited. The respondent here is like unto the defendant there. See also Anglo-Newfoundland Development Co. v. Newfoundland Pine and Pulp Co.[4]\nThe appeal should be allowed and the trial judgment restored with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The sole question in this case is whether the bills of lading (so called) attached to the draft discounted by the plaintiff bank were in compliance with the terms upon which the defendant bank guaranteed payment of the draft. I agree with the learned judges of the Appellate Division that, in guaranteeing\npayment of drafts on J.J. McCabe with bills of lading attached,\nthe guarantors were stipulating for documents to be attached to the draft which would exclusively entitle them or their customer McCabe (whom they knew and were prepared to trust) to delivery of the consignment from the carrier. The bills of lading in fact attached to the draft made the vendors, The Mutual Orange Distributors, consignees, and each on its face also bore this note:\u2014\nDeliver without bill of lading on written order of Mutual Orange Distributors\u2019 agent.\nThe way bills also carried the same note. The effect of these documents, according to their terms, was to leave the consignment under the control and subject to the order of the vendors, the Mutual Orange Distributors, and, if it had been delivered to them or upon their order or that of their agent, the carrier would probably have had a complete answer to any claim by the defendant bank. In other words, the effect of the bills of lading was that (if liable on its guarantee) the bank would have been compelled to trust for its security upon the goods to the responsibility of the Mutual Orange Distributors and not to that of its own customer or of the carrier, for which it had stipulated.\nIt was contended that in California, where the shipment was made and the draft discounted, it was customary for banks to accept a bill of lading under which the consignor should also be the consignee as equivalent to a bill in which the purchaser was named as consignee, and that when such a bill of lading had been issued the carrier would make delivery to the person producing it and to him only. It is possible that if this had been the situation the stipulation upon which the bank guaranteed payment would have been complied with. But there is no evidence that it was customary in California or anywhere else to treat a bill of lading, bearing a note, such as that placed upon the bills here in question, entitling the carrier to deliver without production of the bills of lading, as equivalent to a bill of lading wherein the purchaser was named as the consignee, or that such a bill of lading would exclusively entitle the person producing it to delivery from the carrier. As Mr. Justice Riddell said, while the defendant bank may not have been entitled to have McCabe named as the consignee rather than the vendors,\nthe effect of the added clause permitting delivery without bill of lading on the mere order of the consignors (consignees) is different.\nAgain to quote from the opinion of the learned appellate judge (Riddell J.)\nLooking now at the transaction in question, the object of attaching the bills of lading to the draft was the security of the Bank of Commerce. This might have been effected by a bill of lading properly drawn and (or) indorsed, whereby the bank became entitled to the goods themselves. This was not asked for. Or the bill of lading sent forward might be for the protection of the bank in that the bill of lading, being in their hands, no one could legally obtain possession of the goods covered by the bill of lading without the bank\u2019s consent. It seems to me clear that both banks quite understood that such a protection should be afforded by the bill of lading, and that anything, even though called a bill of lading, which did not afford that protection to the Bank of Commerce would cause \u201csuch a failure of consideration as can not have been within the contemplation of either side\u201d: The Moorcock[5], at p. 68, per Bowen LJ.\nAdmittedly the bill of lading sent did not, as it could not, prevent the goods being dealt with (and lawfully dealt with so far as the carrier is concerned) without the bank\u2019s consent; and therefore, in my opinion, this was not such a bill of lading as the Canadian bank had a right to receive before being bound by their guaranty.\nMuch was made in the argument of the words, \u201cnotify J.J. McCabe,\u201d which followed the name of the consignee on the face of the bills of lading. But these words are under the heading\nMail address, not for the purpose of delivery,\nand do not import any right to delivery in McCabe. They were probably meant to enable McCabe, upon advice from the carrier of the arrival of the goods, to take steps to obtain a right to delivery under the terms of the bill of lading. As a fact, on application to the consignor\u2019s agent, McCabe was refused an order for delivery without instructions from the consignors, which were not given.\nIt may be that by some means or device McCabe could have got the goods from the carrier on their arrival at destination. It may be that, if sued for the price by the vendors, McCabe would have no defence to the action. But it does not follow that there was compliance with the terms on which the defendant bank agreed to assume the liability of a guarantor. Those terms were that from the moment that liability should arise, i.e., from the time at which the draft should be discounted by the plaintiff bank, the guarantor should have, through the bill of lading attached to the draft, such security as would be afforded it by goods held by the carrier subject to delivery only to itself or its customer McCabe. In my opinion the defendant bank did not receive the consideration for which it stipulated as a term of guaranteeing the draft on McCabe and on that short ground its defence should prevail.\nFor authorities shewing the necessity for strict compliance with the terms of a guarantee reference may be made to DeColyar on Guarantees (3 ed.) p. 201 n. (i) and 15 Halsbury, Laws of England, page 479, par. 914.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014I concur with MR.

Canadian Pacific Railway Co. and the City of London[1].\nCowan K.C. and Hoyles for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The Bell Telephone Company, hereafter referred to as the Company, operating under a federal charter, carries on business throughout Canada. At its origin the company established a system of telephone lines to serve the local needs of cities, towns and villages, and, as the necessities of its customers increased, long distance lines were built to connect those localities with one another and with localities similarly situated in the United States. Finally, the system developed to such an extent that practically the whole Dominion east of Port Arthur was provided with a complete telephone service operated free from public control, and, consequently, without regard for the public convenience, except in so far as consistent with the interests of its shareholders. In the course of this development, the desire for telephone service spread so that, to satisfy the wants of rural municipalities, which were dissatisfied with the service rendered, small local companies were organized, sometimes in competition with the local exchanges of the Company, and, in some instances, in places to which the latter had not furnished a service; those companies so established are known in these proceedings as \"independent companies.\"\nIn the course of time, the communities served by the independent companies desired closer connection, but presumably the capital and experience necessary to establish and profitably maintain the connecting links were not available. A convenient way to satisfy that desire was found in the Company's long distance system. Apparently, the latter company, not anxious to satisfy the wants of their local competitors, refused the relief asked for, hence the usual agitation, resulting in an application to Parliament for the appointment of a parliamentary commission of inquiry, and, on the report of that commission, an Act was passed the purpose of which, as disclosed by the title, was to bring telegraph and telephone companies under the jurisdiction of the Board of Railway Commissioners.\nBy that Act, ch. 61, 7 & 8 Edward VII., complete control was given to the Board for the regulation of the business of the Company.\nBy section 4, sub-section 5, of the Act, it is provided, in substance, that any company, province, municipality or corporation, having authority to construct and operate a telephone system, and which desires to be connected with and to use any long distance telephone system then in existence, and whether such company is under the control of Parliament or not, may apply to the Board, if no private agreement can be obtained, for relief, and the Board may, in the words of the section,\norder the company (i.e., the company which owns, controls, or operates the long distance telephone system) to provide for such use, connection or communication upon such terms as to compensation as the Board deems just and expedient, and may order and direct, how, etc., when, where and by whom, etc. * * *\nBy sub-section 6 of section 4 it is provided that the Board shall, in addition to any other consideration affecting the case, take into consideration the standards of efficiency and otherwise of the apparatus and appliances of such telephone systems or lines, and shall only grant the leave applied for in case and in so far as, in view of such standards, the use, connection or communication applied for can, in the opinion of the Board, be made or exercised satisfactorily and without undue or unreasonable injury to, or interference with, the telephone business of the Company.\nSo that, in effect, the statute provides for the use by local companies of long distance lines on two conditions: (1) The Board must be satisfied, as a condition precedent, that the apparatus of the applicant company is of such a standard as to efficiency or otherwise as to permit the use or connection without undue or unreasonable injury to the long distance line; and (2) the Board may order the connection with and the use of the long distance line upon such terms as to compensation as it deems just and expedient.\nIt is quite obvious that the Act, whilst giving the Board absolute power of control over all companies for the purpose of regulating the interchange of business in the public interest, has been careful to require a proper standard of efficiency with respect to equipment and provides for the protection of the rights of the shareholders of the Company, whose property may be appropriated to the use of the independent companies. But the statute does not contemplate the regulation by the Board of competition between public service corporations, and I can find nothing in the reasons given by Commissioner McLean, speaking for the majority of the Board, to justify the assumption that the Board attempts to do anything in that direction.\nI quite agree with the late Chief Commissioner Mabee, who said that in most public services competition is desirable in the public interest, but a duplicating of telephone systems is a nuisance. What is required and what the Act contemplates is efficient regulation of the conditions under which the telephone companies are to co-operate in the exchange of business facilities.\nIn 1911 an application was made to the Board, under the Act, by several independent companies, for permission to connect with and use the long distance line of the Company. At the time about 378 private contracts had been made for that purpose, and, as a result of that application, it was ordered that the Company should connect its long distance telephone system or line with the lines of the applicant companies, subject to certain conditions as to cost of building the connecting lines. The order also provides for the payment to the Company on outbound traffic of a connecting toll of fifteen cents for each long distance message originating upon the lines of the applicant companies and transmitted over the line of the Company, in addition to their long distance tariff.\nIt is to be noticed that what is called \"inbound traffic\"\u2014that is to say, traffic originating upon the Company's system destined to local points upon the lines of the various applicants\u2014is exempt from this toll.\nSo that, in substance, it was decided that, if the apparatus of the applicant companies was of the required standard of efficiency, the long distance line built and operated at the expense of the shareholders and subscribers of the Company should, with its staff of operators, be placed at the service of the applicant companies subject to the conditions above mentioned.\nIt was provided at the same time that this order was to remain in force for a period of at least twelve months, leave being reserved to move to rescind or vary the order at the expiration of that period should any of the parties so desire. Taking advantage of this reservation, the Company asked to have the order rescinded. The independent companies, in reply to that application, asked to have the order maintained, and, at the same time, said that the charges for long distance connection have been and are unfair to the shareholders of those independent systems inasmuch as the toll for long distance connection is altogether too large. There is apparently no complaint with respect to the charge for connecting the lines.\nAs the result of that application an order was made by the Board providing for, as regards non-competing companies, (1) payment of an annual charge by way of compensation for loss to the Company, as well as for the factor of convenience to the independent subscriber; (2), as regards competing companies, an annual charge is imposed and also a surchage of ten cents on each communication.\nThe Chief Commissioner dissented from the order, and, in those circumstauces, the following questions are put to us:\u2014 1. Whether the Board had power under the \"Railway Act\" and amending Acts to authorize the charging of any additional toll or charge outside the established rates of the Bell Telephone Company of Canada as a condition precedent to or as compensation for the use of long distance lines of the said Bell Telephone Company of Canada.\n2. Whether the Board is authorized under the \"Railway Act\" and amending Acts to give compensation in respect of the loss of business to the Bell Telephone Company's local exchange business occasioned by giving independent companies long distance connection.\n3. Whether the Board has power to authorize the payment of a special toll as a condition precedent to companies competing with the Bell obtaining long distance connection with the Bell, while not subjecting non-competing companies to a like toll in view of the provisions of the Act relating to discrimination.\nI would answer them all in the affirmative.\nI am of opinion, as I have already said, that the evident intention of Parliament was to give the Board, in the public interest, absolute power to regulate this public utility, which has grown to be almost an essential factor in the every-day life of the whole community, and for that purpose has conferred the widest discretion upon the Board. In that view I fail to see the practical use of this reference, but the questions are before us and must, therefore, be dealt with.\nThe statute authorizes the Board to oblige the Company to: (1) Give a connection with its long distance line to local companies; (2) to give those local companies the use of its long distance line for the benefit of the subscribers of such local companies.\nIn other words, the Board is authorized to expropriate the Company for the benefit of the independent companies, but the Act provides, as common sense and the general principles of law applicable in like cases require, that this may only be done\nupon the condition that the equipment of the connecting company shall be such as not to impair the efficiency of the service and upon such terms as to compensation as the Board may deem \"just and expedient.\" In other words, the statute requires that the Company should not, in the language of the Quebec Code, be compelled to give up its property\nexcept for public utility and in consideration of a just indemnity previously paid.\nI, therefore, construe the Act to mean that power is given the Board to expropriate the Company, to a limited extent, for the benefit of those independent companies, provided it can be done consistently with an efficient service and upon payment of compensation. And large discretionary powers are given with regard to the compensation to be paid by the use of the words, \"just and expedient.\" That is to say, it is left to the commissioners to decide what compensation is, in all the circumstances, \"just and expedient\" for the use of the connection or communication. If an additional toll or charge, outside of the established rates of the Company, is, in the opinion of the commissioners, necessary to compensate that company for the use of its long distance line, then the statute authorizes the Board to make that charge.\nI have no doubt also that the statute authorizes the Board to give compensation with respect to the loss of business of the Company occasioned by giving to local companies long distance connection, and also to make a distinction between the local companies which are called competing companies and those known as non-competing companies.\nSpeaking of the conditions under which the Company carries on its operations, Commissioner McLean, who delivered the opinion of the majority of the Board, says:\u2014\nIn the annual payment made by each of the Bell Telephone Company's subscribers there is, in reality, included some contribution not only to the initial cost but also to the maintenance cost of the Bell long distance equipment. * * * In the Bell annual local service no particular part of the charge is ear-marked for the long distance service, although the long distance is part of the general service which all the earnings assist in maintaining. * * * There is aflat annual service charge. The contribution towards initial and maintenance cost which is contained in the annual payment of the Bell Telephone subscriber is a factor which is peculiar to the Bell Telephone Company subscriber, and is not properly allocatable to the user of the independent telephone who may for the time being be using the Bell long distance equipment. In the case of the Bell subscriber there is a question of joint costs, some contribution to long distance cost being made by an actual user of the local telephone service, who is also an actual or a potential user of the long distance service.\nIf, as found by the Board\u2014and the fact is not disputed\u2014the long distance line is a charge on the whole Bell system because it was built out of the general capital and is maintained at the expense of the profits made out of the operation of the local exchanges, then it would seem \"just and expedient\" that, in fixing the compensation to be paid for the use of that long distance connection by a company which has not contributed either to the initial cost or to the maintenance cost, the factor of competition as it is described in the question, with the local exchange should be considered.\nIn other words, if the long distance lines are, as we must assume, when built, a charge on the Company shareholders and subscribers, and if in their operation a loss is incurred which must be borne by the local Bell Telephone exchanges, then is it not just and equitable that the independent company operating in the same area as the local exchange should also contribute by the surcharge to that loss in the upkeep of the long distance line which is placed by the Board at their disposal ? The subscription of the Bell customers being, of course, fixed by the charges which the Company has to meet for the upkeep of its whole system, which includes the long distance and local service, then it is just and expedient that the share- holders of the independent companies who have the use of the same service should also contribute by the surcharge to the maintenance of the long distance service.\nIf the Commissioners deem it expedient to place those localities to which the Company has not given a local service on a more favourable footing, it is within their discretion so to do.\nDavies J.\u2014The three questions of law which are submitted for our consideration and answer by the Board of Railway Commissioners do not call for or justify any consideration on our part of the desirability or undesirability of duplication and competition, which were referred to and discussed shorty at the argument. Those are matters entirely for the Board to consider and weigh in coming to their conclusions.\nWe are asked substantially:\u2014\n(1) Whether the Board had power to authorize the charge of an additional toll outside of its established rates by the Bell Company in part compensation for the use of its long distance line.\n(2) Whether the Board can give compensation to the Bell Company in respect of its possible loss of local exchange business occasioned by giving independent companies long distance connection; and\n3. Whether the Board has power to authorize the charge of a special toll to competing companies without subjecting non-competing companies to a like toll.\nThe answers we are to give to these three questions depend upon the construction we give to sub-sections 5 and 6 of section 4, 7 & 8 Edw. VII., ch. 61, and such parts ;of the \"Railway Act\" as may apply.\nIt seems to me, in construing these sections, that two things have to be decided by the Board:\u2014First, whether the application for long distance use and connection should be granted at all; and, next, if so, upon what terms as to compensation.\nSub-section 6 expressly enacts that the Board shall, in addition to any other consideration affecting the case, take into consideration the standards as to efficiency and otherwise of the apparatus and appliances of the applicant's telephones, systems or lines, and shall only grant the leave when, in view of such standards, the connection asked can be\nexercised satisfactorily and without undue or unreasonable injury to or interference with the telephone business of the company,\nwith which connection is sought.\nI would construe this section as prohibiting the granting of the connecting order unless the Board, after considering everything affecting the matter of the application, including the applicants' standards of efficiency of its apparatus and appliances, was satisfied that the connection and use sought would not unduly injure or interfere with the telephone business of the company sought to be connected with.\nThe Board must, before granting the order, be satisfied that no such undue injury will result from granting the connection asked for.\nIf they cannot so satisfy themselves, they should not grant an order at all.\nThe language of the 5th sub-section is permissive\u2014may order the connection sought. That of the 6th sub-section is conditional\u2014they shall only grant when under certain conditions specified they find the granting of the order will not cause undue or unreasonable injury to the business of the long distance company.\nWhen they have so decided, then and then only can they proceed to the question of compensation. It is not a question to be determined that there shall be no loss to the long distance company, but that there shall not be undue or unreasonable loss to the business of the company. Some lose evidently was contemplated as naturally arising from the granting of the connecting order. If that loss would constitute \"undue or unreasonable interference with the telephone business of the company,\" the order should not be made.\nThe 6th sub-section provided for the conditions under which the order should or should not be made, and the 5th sub-section for the compensation which should be granted if and when made.\nCommissioner McLean construed the 6th sub-section as confined to injury or interference with the company's business arising out of the use of improper appliances by the connecting company.\nI cannot put such a narrow construction upon it, in view of the language used:\u2014\nUpon any such application the Board shall in addition to any other consideration affecting the case take into consideration the standards, etc.\nThese latter were, from being specially mentioned' no doubt very important factors for the Board to consider; but they constituted only one factor\nin addition to any other consideration affecting the case.\nThe result of my construction would be that no order should be granted in any case where it was found that it would result in undue or unreasonable interference with the company's business, and that, where such a result was not found and the order was made, the compensation which the 5th sub-section authorized them to award as just and expedient was confined to compensation \"for the use, connection or communication\" granted, as expressed in the sub-section, and did not authorize compensation for losses which possibly or probably would or might be caused to the company with which the connection was ordered in its local exchange business. I am quite in accord with Sir Henry Drayton's statement, in his reasons for the dissenting opinion he delivered, that he was \"unable to read the somewhat extended clause here applicable as creating a new and novel law of compensation covering the business losses suffered by one public service corporation as the result of competition with another public service corporation.\"\nI agree with him that these possible business losses were not matters the Board was concerned with unless they were found so great as to justify the refusal of the order, as before explained, and that, as Sir Henry puts it,\ncompensation for the actual use, connection or communication for the actual facilities supplied and for its subsequent use\nis all that the Board can consider and award.\nI will not elaborate the matter further, but, in view of what I have said, would answer the questions as follows:\u2014\nIn answer to the first question:\u2014Yes.\n(2) In answer to the second question:\u2014No.\n(3) In answer to the third question:\u2014Yes.\nI answer the third question in the affirmative because of the special reasons for its insertion in the order as explained by the Assistant Chief Commissioner in his written reasons, concurred in by the other commissioners, except the Chief Commissioner. It seems to have been a clause expressly desired by the appellants and agreed to by respondents, and was not a clause inserted in the order by the Board of its own volition, but simply because it was agreed to by the parties themselves. Idington J.\u2014This appeal suggests we should once more turn to the rules in Heydon's Case[2], to be found in Craies' Hardcastle at page 104 (2 ed.), and have regard especially to the holding following them expressed as follows:\u2014\nAnd then the office of all the judges is always to make such construction as shall suppress the mischief and advance the remedy, and to suppress subtle inventions and evasions for the continuance of the mischief and pro privato commodo, and to add force and life to the cure and remedy according to the true intent of the makers of the Act pro bono.publico.\nWhat was the mischief intended to be remedied by the enactment in 1906, 6 Edw. VII., ch. 42, sec. 31, and substituted by 7 & 8 Edw. VII., ch. 61, sec. 4, sub-sec. 5?\nThat suggests another question:\u2014What was the mischief intended to be remedied by the \"Railway Act's\" provisions constituting a Board of Railway Commissioners?\nWas it not that the railway companies had forgotten that they owed a duty to the public to furnish facilities for traffic, interchange of traffic, and equality of treatment, both as to rates and otherwise, of everyone offering them business?\nIt was, no doubt, shocking to the minds of those railway managers, who acted in the single pursuit of what they imagined was their only interest and duty, to be told that they must serve the public, and each member of the public, upon the same basis of compensation and accommodation, and give every facility for accomplishing that service, no matter if it should turn into a rival's lines part of the haulage they had previously deemed their own preserve.\nTo enforce these obligations the Board of Railway Commissioners was created. And when the principles in question had been thus by law established and thus enforced, it seemed to open to Parliament the way for applying similar treatment to the respondent and other like companies dealing not in haulage, but means of communication.\nTheir rivals in business insisted that it was the public that was to be served and facilitated in business, and, in order that the public might be properly served, connections must be made.\nThe cases were so much alike; the remedies to be applied so much alike; and the interference with vested rights, bringing liabilities to losses of business to be reaped by upstart rivals, so much alike, that it would seem as if Parliament had only to recognize these facts and then place the telephone companies under the jurisdiction of the Board.\nOf course, all that was very shocking to those who had, by the gracious wisdom of Parliament, acquired valuable rights over public highways without giving any compensation or even asking leave of those concerned.\nIt would seem, however, after having been so favoured, that the public in many cases was not adequately served or charged too much for the service, and hence I gather there sprang up local rivals, more willing to serve or more moderate in charges, or possibly both.\nIt is suggested even municipalities and provinces were possibly willing to supply the needed want of rural telephone service especially.\nParliament deemed it proper that the respondent and others should not refuse those rivals proper and efficient service, and ordered accordingly, by amending the \"Railway Act,\" and by making the provisions of that Act applicable as follows:\u2014 The several provisions of the \"Railway Act\" with respect to the jurisdiction of the Board, practice and procedure, upon applications to the Board, appeal to the Supreme Court or the Governor-in-Council, offences and penalties, and the other provisions of the said Act (except sections 9, 79 to 243, both inclusive, 250 to 289, both inclusive, 294 to 314, both inclusive, 348 to 354, both inclusive, 361 to 396, both inclusive, 405 to 431, both inclusive), in so far as reasonably applicable and not inconsistent with this part or the special Act, shall apply to the jurisdiction of the Board and the exercise thereof, created and authorized by this Act, and for the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of this part according to their true intent and meaning and shall apply generally to companies within the purview of this part.\nOf those enactments thus made applicable in principle, there appear, under the caption of \"Equality,\" a number of sections which the order appealed against seems to me to clearly transgress.\nAnd let it be observed that in the first two lines of section 5 I have just quoted, it is \"with respect to the jurisdiction of the Board,\" these parts of the \"Railway Act\" stand effectual.\nWhy did Parliament so enact if it intended in truth to help respondent to squeeze rivals out of existence by means of gross inequalities of tolls and impositions?\nClearly, each of these companies had gathered together, by local influence and energy and low rates, a business that the respondent might have had, but, for want of energy or timidity or excessive charges, had failed to acquire and hold. And that business must be paying its way, but possibly doing no more. And this inequality (expressed in the order now complained of), in defiance of what the provisions of the \"Railway Act,\" by being left applicable thereto, surely intended to be the measure of the Board's jurisdiction, may enable the respondent to reap where it had not sown.\nSuch a clear purpose cannot be swept away by the interpretation of the words, and the Board may order the company to provide for such use, connection or communication upon such terms as to compensation as the Board deems just and expedient, etc.\nIf Parliament really intended to compensate by the destruction of other companies, it should and, no doubt, would have said so.\nMoreover, I repeat, it was the public that was to be served and that upon an equal basis of service was what Parliament had in view.\nIt never could have intended that rural subscribers to the only 'phone company they could get in communication with, were to be penalized for so subscribing.\nIt is not a question of the rate compensating, for admittedly the ordinary rate would be ample for the service, and needs no surcharge, unless when people have been wicked enough to ignore the respondent.\nSubstantially such things as set up by respondent happened many times to rival railway companies in the administration of the \"Railway Act\" in the new departure made, and intended to make the companies realize that it was the public service that must be the key note of their conduct towards each other.\nThe London Inter switching Case[3], when before this court, seemed to me a pretty strong application of the principles invoked therein, and on the basis adopted below for doing justice herein seemed possibly to work an injustice, but I never doubted the correctness of the law as laid down by the late Mr. Justice Killam, acting as Chief Commissioner of the Board, and maintained by this court.\nThat kind of thing resulting from this sort of legislation never can have been conceived as an injustice by the legislature enacting it. They recognize it may today work apparent injustice in one place and give a compensating advantage in another. And, if not, the march of events can take no account of such gains or losses as injustice.\nAnd when Parliament imposed upon the Board the duty in question of fixing a just compensation, it never could have intended the Board to do more than the words mean, a just compensation for a service which cannot be measured in one town or township by one method or measure and an entirely different method or measure resulting in lower charges for the service in the next town or township, perhaps further away.\nThe limited power or jurisdiction of the Board to try and do justice, in making its orders, by importing into the business in hand a something not provided in the Act, but yet a smoothing out of the crudities of the legislature and avoiding injustice, was well illustrated in the case of. The Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Co. v. City of Fort William[4], where the Board, on an application to run over a public street, imposed the condition that the adjoining owners on the street should be compensated.\nThe majority of this court held that, by virtue of the power in section 47 to make conditional orders, the order of the Board might be upheld. But this was reversed by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, holding such an order null.\nIt strikes me this attempt to do justice as an incident to fixing a just compensation stands on similar legal footing.\nThe only difference I see is that there the Board attempted to grapple with a hoary-headed species of injustice, and here the quality of the justice is not by any means so clear. All the Board has power to deal with is to fix a just compensation for the service if the thing be expedient. We must try and reach the common-sense meaning rather than, by cutting sentences into slices, try to extract a meaning from a legislator's language which would startle him.\nExpedient compensation can mean nothing. The draftsman evidently had reference to the occasion and expense relevant to the connection, if expedient, and not the measure of compensation for the service itself once that connection made or ordered to be made.\nI think the Board had no power to import into their consideration the question of competition, for a competitor serving the public is entitled, in performing such service, to get the accommodation and service and be treated as if not a rival.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs and the questions answered accordingly.\nI respectfully submit the first question is ambiguous and can hardly be answered by a simple yes or no. My opinion is that there can be no discrimination in favour of respondent or any one else, or as against anyone. But it may be necessary to alter the established rates from time to time to award proper compensation, and that is within the jurisdiction of the Board.\nThe other two questions I answer in the negative.\nAnglin J.\u2014Three questions are submitted by the Board of Railway Commissioners for the opinion of the court. While these questions, as framed, are rather questions of jurisdiction than of law, and as such more properly the subject of an appeal by leave of a judge of this court, they may perhaps be regarded as substantially asking the opinion of the court upon the question whether, in determining the amount of compensation which should be paid, under sub-section 5 of section 4 of 7 & 8 Edw. VII. ch. 61, to the Bell Telephone Company by independent telephone companies given the advantage of connection with the trunk lines of the former company, the effect upon its local business should be taken into consideration.\nBy sub-section 5 the Board is empowered\nTo order and direct how, when, where and by whom and upon what terms and conditions (the) use, connection or communication (of, with or through long distance lines) shall be had, constructed, installed, operated and maintained.\nAnd\nTo order the company (i.e., the company owning the long distance lines) to provide for such use, connection or communication upon such terms as to compensation as the Board deems just and expedient.\nThe clause of the sub-section first quoted covers all \"terms\" other than those as to compensation. The only \"terms\" dealt with in the clause last quoted are those \"as to compensation.\" While the Board is authorized to direct the company\nto provide for such use, connection or communication,\nit is not for this service that it is empowered to order compensation, which, in that case, might mean merely \"remuneration,\" but, as a condition of directing that such use, etc., shall be provided, the Board is authorized to impose \"compensation,\" i.e., indemnification to the company directed to provide it. Murray defines \"compensate\" as meaning \"to counterbalance, make up for, make amends for,\" and \"compensation\" as \"amends or recompense for loss or damage.\" We are perhaps most familiar with the use of the term \"compensation,\" both in legislation and jurisprudence, in regard to the expropriation of property for public uses. Mr. Cripps, in his work on Compensation (5 ed.), p. 102, dealing with land expropriated, says:\u2014 The principle of compensation is indemnity to the owner. * * * The question is not what the persons who take * * * will gain by taking it, but what the person from whom it is taken will lose by having it taken from him.\nSee, too, Brown and Allen on Compensation (2 ed.), p. 97, and authorities cited by both authors.\nIf mere payment or remuneration for the service to be rendered were what Parliament intended should be allowed, that idea would have found expression in some phrase very different from, and much more restricted in its scope, than\nupon such terms as to compensation as the Board deems just and expedient.\nI also agree with the view expressed by Mr. Commissioner McLean that the addition of the word \"expedient\" after the word \"just\" affords a strong indication that it was the purpose of Parliament to entrust to the Board the widest discretion, not merely as to the amount of the compensation to be directed, but also as to the elements which should be taken into account in fixing it.\nThere can be little doubt that, in determining the prices to be charged for telephones to local subscribers, the Bell Telephone Company takes two elements into account, the value and cost of the local service and the value and cost of the long distance service. A company which does not maintain or provide a long distance service cannot reasonably exact as high a price for telephones from its subscribers and it can well afford to furnish local service at a lower rate. I confess that I fail to appreciate the justice of a demand that the Bell Telephone Company, which owns and maintains long distance lines, shall place them at the disposal of other and rival companies on any terms other than indemnification against loss or damage which it may sustain in consequence. Should it be obliged to so so, the probable result in places where the Bell Telephone Company operates a local exchange in competition with an independent company would be either an actual discrimination against Bell subscribers or a compulsory reduction by the Bell Company of its charge for local telephones to the level of the charge made by the company without long distance lines. As is well known, the existence of competition is treated in the \"Railway Act\" as affording justification for a difference, in railway rates which would otherwise be obnoxious to the anti-discrimination provisions of that statute.\nThese latter considerations do not apply to independent companies within whose territory the Bell Company does not operate local exchanges. They afford reasonable ground for differentiation in the compensation to be made by companies of the two classes.\nI would, for these reasons, answer the questions submitted in the affirmative.\nBrodeur J.\u2014This is a reference by the Board of Railway Commissioners under the provisions of the \"Railway Act.\" The questions which are submitted are the following:\u2014\n1. Whether the Board has power, under the \"Railway Act\" and amending Acts, to authorize the charging of an additional toll or charge outside the established rates of the Bell Telephone Company of Canada as a condition precedent to or as compensation for the use of long distance lines of the said Bell Telephone Company of Canada.\n2. Whether the Board is authorized, under the \"Railway Act\" and amending Acts, to give compensation in respect of the loss of business to the Bell Company's local exchange business, occasioned by giving independent companies long distance connection.\n3. Whether the Board has power to authorize the payment of a special toll as a condition precedent to companies competing with the Bell Telephone Company obtaining long distance connection with the Bell Telephone Company, while not subjecting non-competing companies to a like toll in view of the provisions of the Act relating to discrimination. There is no doubt with regard to the answer to be given to the first question. It should be in the affirmative. The Board of Railway Commissioners, by section 4 of chapter 61, 1908, has the power to determine the tolls that are to be charged by any telephone company. That power is as wide and general as possible, and the tolls can be increased or reduced according to circumstances.\nThat question, however, does not cover the main issues in this reference, for that reference has been made with the purpose of ascertaining whether the Bell Telephone Company was entitled to compensation for the loss of its local exchange business occasioned by giving the appellant companies long distance connections and whether there should be discriminating rates or tolls between competing and non-competing companies.\nIt was found by Parliament, after careful investigation and inquiry, that the Bell Telephone Company had first built its service lines in cities and towns and then in villages. Connecting trunk lines had been made and long distance connections had been established between those various towns, cities and villages as the public required.\nIn some rural municipalities the local people interested, finding themselves without telephone service, had local companies formed for the purpose of serving their locality. The service which those companies were giving was not very dear, because they had no long distance lines to keep and maintain. Sometimes, too, those local companies were established because they thought that the service given by the Bell Telephone Company was too expensive.\nIt was found, however, at one time that those local companies, being deprived of long distance connections, were not giving to their customers as good service as the Bell Telephone Company. The Parliament was then seized of the request that the Bell Telephone Company should be bound to give the use of the connection or communication of their long distance lines to the subscribers of those local companies. But Parliament, in granting that power of expropriation to the local companies over the lines of the Bell Telephone Company, decided by sub-section 5 of section 4 of the Act of 19.08, ch. 61, that the Board of Railway Commissioners could order the Bell Telephone Company\nupon such terms as to compensation as the Board deems just and expedient\nto provide for such use, connection or communication.\nThe Board dealt with the question in 1911, after having heard all parties interested, and determined the compensation which was to be paid, and, according to the views expressed by the then Chief Commissioner, Mr. Mabee, they determined that the compensation should cover all the damages which could be suffered by the Bell Telephone Company, including damages arising out of the loss to the Bell Telephone Company of its local exchange business.\nIn 1913 a new application was made by the appellants in this case, asking connections with the Bell Telephone Company on their long distance line.\nAll these appellant companies are in their locality competing lines with the Bell Telephone Company. The majority of the Board of Railway Commissioners were of the opinion that permission should be given to use the long distance lines of the Bell Telephone Company on the condition, amongst others, that they should compensate the Bell Telephone Company for the loss of its local exchange business.\nI am of opinion that this order has been rightly issued. Parliament was very willing to give to those local companies the right to use long distance lines, but on the condition that they should compensate the Bell Company for all damages arising out of that use.\nIt has been found as a question of fact by the Board that the Bell Company's subscribers contributed not only to the initial cost, but also to the maintenance of the Bell long distance equipment. If the Bell Company, then, wants to maintain its long distance lines, it has to levy upon its subscribers a certain rate which is necessarily higher than the rate charged by the local companies, those companies having no long distance lines to maintain.\nIt is pretty evident that if the subscribers of the local companies have the same advantage as the Bell subscribers for long distance connections, all the business done locally by the Bell Company will necessarily disappear, because no subscriber, for example, will pay twenty dollars per year to the Bell Company, if they can get for a smaller price the same local and long distance connections in subscribing to the local companies.\nThat matter had to be considered by the Board, and I think that, under the powers which are given by the statute, the Board had the right to take into consideration the compensation for the losses which the Bell Telephone Company was going to incur as a result of giving long distance connections.\nThe compensation contemplated by the statute covered the interference with any private right appurtenant to the property expropriated. The value of the property of the Bell Telephone Company is reduced by the long distance connections which are granted to those local companies, and should then be made the subject of compensation. Halsbury, vol. 6, p. 47. I would be, then, of opinion that the second question should be answered in the affirmative.\nThese same reasons would apply to the third question, which should also be answered in the affirmative.\nThe appellant should pay the costs of this reference.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: C. & H.

McKinnon and Others (Plaintiffs) Respondents.\n1916: June 15, 24.\nPresent: Davies, Idington, Duff, Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ONTARIO.\nContract\u2014Purchase of Bonds\u2014Statute of Frauds\u2014Memorandum in writing\u2014Correspondence\u2014Relation of documents\u2014Parol evidence.\nIn an action against D., claiming damages for breach of a contract to purchase bonds, a telegram from D. to his partner was produced saying, \u201cI absolutely bought them yesterday after our \u2019phone conversation, they agreeing to our terms.\u201d\nHeld, that parol evidence was properly received to shew that terms had been stated by D., over his signature, that they were the only terms and were those referred to in the telegram and the two constituted a sufficient memorandum within the Statute of Frauds. Ridgeway v. Wharton (6 H.L. Cas. 238) and Baumann v. James (3 Ch. App. 508) followed. Duff J. dissented.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division (35 Ont. L.R. 349) affirming that at the trial (34 Ont. L.R. 403) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], affirming, by an equal division of opinion, the judgment at the trial[2] in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe only material question raised on this appeal was that relating to the Statute of Frauds under the circumstances stated in the above head-note. The defendant pleaded two other matters of defence\u2014first, that he was only acting as plaintiff\u2019s agent for sale of the bonds. The courts below held, on the evidence, that he was a purchaser, and that finding was accepted on this appeal. The second defence was that plaintiffs had been guilty of misrepresentation by stating that the bonds had not been offered for sale in New York, whereas they had been so offered and refused. That defence was disposed of on the ground that defendant, after becoming aware of the misrepresentation, did not repudiate his contract to purchase, but elected to adhere to it.\nRowell K.C. and J.E. Lawson, for the appellant, relied on Taylor v. Smith[3].\nJ.B. Clarke K.C., for the respondents, cited Ridgway v. Wharton[4]; Baumann v. James[5]; and Cave v. Hastings[6].\nDAVIES J.\u2014I have had no difficulty in agreeing with the finding of fact of the trial judge, approved of by the Appellate Division, that the appellant defendant is liable on his contract to purchase the Alberta bonds (so-called) in dispute.\nI am also satisfied that, whether or not the alleged misrepresentation on the seller\u2019s part as to the bonds not having before been offered for sale in New York, was such a misrepresentation as would have availed defendant to repudiate his contract, had he elected to do so in proper time, he, with full knowledge of the facts, elected not to repudiate, but to approbate. He cannot now be heard at this stage of the game to change his mind, more especially as the point was not pressed at the trial, where it should have been fought out had the defendant desired to take advantage of it.\nI have had, however, great difficulty in reaching a conclusion, the contract being one within the Statute of Frauds, whether there is sufficient written evidence to satisfy that statute.\nApart from authority, I should have been inclined to think the evidence insufficient, and, although a careful reading of the many authorities pro and con has not entirely removed my doubts, I think the weight of the authority is to the effect that parol evidence may be given to connect two documents together which do not expressly refer to each other, but which connection and reference is a matter of fair and reasonable inference.\nIn this way the two documents may make a contract within the statute. Such evidence may not be resorted to for the purpose of shewing what the terms of the contract are, but only in order to shew what the writing is which is referred to.\nIn Ridgway v. Wharton[7] Lord Cranworth, when sitting alone as Lord Chancellor and over\u2011ruling the decision of the Vice-Chancellor, is reported as saying:\u2014\nEven though the terms had in fact been previously reduced into writing, the statute is not complied with unless the whole contract is either embodied in some writing signed by the party, or in some paper referred to in a signed document, and capable of being identified by means of the description of it contained in the signed paper.\nAfterwards, when the case came before the House of Lords on appeal, he, after two arguments, changed his mind on the point of the admissibility of parol evidence to identify the writing or document to be read into or connected with the one signed by the party sought to be charged, and is reported in 6 House of Lords Cases, at page 257, as saying, after referring to his change of opinion:\u2014\nThe authorities lead to this conclusion that if there is an agreement to do something, not expressed on the face of the agreement signed, that something which is to be done being included in some other writing, parol evidence may be admitted to shew what that writing is, so that the two, taken together, may constitute a binding agreement within the Statute of Frauds.\nIn that case \u201cinstructions\u201d were referred to which might have been either by parol or in writing, but it was held that it might be shewn by parol evidence that instructions had been given in writing, and that there had been no other instructions than the written document which had been produced.\nThe case of Ridgway v. Wharton[8] was followed by Baumann v. James[9], an action brought by a tenant against his landlord for specific performance of an agreement to grant a lease. The landlord had written a letter promising the tenant a lease for fourteen years \u201cat the rent and terms agreed upon,\u201d to which the tenant wrote back an unqualified acceptance.\nThe Court of Appeal held, on the authority of Ridgeway v. Wharton8 and other cases, that parol evidence was admissible to connect a report, made by a surveyor, previously recommending the granting a lease for fourteen years at a given rent, and that it being conclusively established that there had never been any other rent or terms agreed upon than those mentioned in the report, there was a sufficient memorandum in writing to satisfy the Statute of Frauds.\nThe cases of Taylor v. Smith[10], Potter v. Peters[11], and others upon which Mr. Rowell naturally relied to support his contention are difficult to reconcile with the decisions above referred to, but the case of Long v. Millar[12] is in line with them. In the latter case the purchaser signed a memorandum to purchase three lots of land, 40 feet frontage on Pickford Street, Hammersmith, for \u00a3310, and agreed to pay deposit in part payment of \u00a331 and pay the balance and complete on the 1st October. The vendor (defendant) signed a receipt for the \u00a331\ndeposit on the purchase of three plots of land, Hammersmith.\nBoth documents were signed at the same time, and the Court held that they could be connected by parol evidence, and that, together, they formed a sufficient contract to satisfy the Statute of Frauds. In that case, Bramwell L.J. said (p. 454):\u2014\nI think that, subject to the point which has been raised as to the omission of the vendor\u2019s name from the agreement signed by the plaintiff and the receipt, there is a sufficient memorandum, and it appears to me that Ridgway v. Wharton[13] and Baumann v. James[14] are in point, and are decisive.\nBagallay L.J. says (p. 455):\u2014\nThe true principle is that there must exist a writing to which the document signed by the party to be charged can refer, but that this writing may be identified by verbal evidence.\nAnd Thesiger L.J., at p. 456, says:\u2014\nIf, however, it appears from the instrument itself that another document is referred to, that document may be identified by verbal evidence. A simple illustration of this rule is given in Ridgeway v. Wharton13; there \u201cinstructions\u201d were referred to; now instructions may be either written or verbal; but it was held that parol evidence might be adduced to shew that certain instructions in writing were intended. This rule of interpretation is merely a particular application of the doctrine as to latent ambiguity. Although parol evidence may be given to identify the document intended to be referred to, it must be clear that the words of the document signed by the party to be charged will extend to the document sought to be identified. And in Wylson v. Dunn[15], Kekewich J., in 1887, at p. 575, says:\u2014\nTherefore the reference may be a matter of fair and reasonable inference, * * * but there need not be an express reference from one letter to the other.\nThe learned writer of the article on \u201cContract,\u201d in Art. 761, in the 7th volume of Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England, has collected all the authorities on both sides of the question in a note to that article, page 369 of that volume. His own opinion of the result of the authorities is summed up in Art. 761, as follows:\u2014\n761. When one document refers to another, the two may be read together so as to constitute a complete memorandum.\nThe same rule applies if the documents can be connected together by reasonable inference, although there is no express reference from one document to the other.\nNow, in the case before us we have the defendant\u2019s telegram of the 3rd June to his associate in New York, Daude, as follows:\u2014\nE. Daude,\nHotel Martinique, June 3rd, 1914.\nNew York, N.Y.\nThe Alberta Bonds which you have particulars of, no one else has for sale. I absolutely bought them yesterday after our \u2019phone conversation, they agreeing to our terms. Put sale through at once.\n(Sgd.) J.J. DORAN.\nRush charge.\nThe question is, can the identity of the bonds and the meaning of the words, \u201cour terms,\u201d be fixed by prior letters or documents signed by the defendant? I am of the opinion that, under the authorities, they can, and that parol evidence was properly received to prove the existence and identity of the documents shewing what these terms were, and that they had been stated by defendant over his own signature, and that there were no other terms than those stated and to which the telegram applied.\nOnce the principle I have accepted is applied to the facts of the case, no room for doubt can exist as to the identity of the Alberta bonds or the meaning of the words \u201cour terms,\u201d or as to the statute having been complied with.\nThe appeal, therefore, fails and must be dismissed with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The telegram of 3rd June, 1914, from appellant to his friend and agent, Daude, as follows:\u2014\nE. Daude,\nHotel Martinique, June 3rd, 1914.\nNew York, N.Y.\nThe Alberta Bonds which you have particulars of, no one else has for sale. I absolutely bought them yesterday after our \u2019phone conversation, they agreeing to our terms. Put sale through at once.\n(Sgd.) J.J. DORAN.\nRush charge.\nseems to dispose of the appellant\u2019s pretension that he was only an agent of respondents, and opens the way to find in the rest of the correspondence evidence to satisfy the Statute of Frauds, assuming the contract falls within the requirements of that statute.\nI think that with no other oral evidence than such as permitted in such cases to enable one to understand what the parties were about, there is enough in the correspondence to demonstrate therefrom a contract evidenced in writing to comply with the statute.\nAs to the alleged misrepresentation, I do not think even if a possible defence that the appellant can maintain it in face of the fact that after full knowledge of its alleged effect he continued instead of repudiating to act as he did.\nI think the damages are more questionable, but I am unable to say, as matter of law, that the loss to respondents was less than the learned trial judge has assessed.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J. (dissenting)\u2014I would allow this appeal.\nANGLIN J.\u2014In view of the explicit finding of the learned trial judge that the plaintiffs and their witnesses are to be credited rather than the defendant and his witness Daude, it is quite impossible to reverse the holding, concurred in by all the appellate judges, that the defendant contracted to purchase the bonds in question as a principal.\nI am also satisfied, for the reasons assigned by Mr. Justice Riddell, that if there was misrepresentation as to prior negotiations in New York in regard to these bonds, the defendant, with full knowledge, elected not to exercise any right to rescind to which such misrepresentation might have given rise. The evidence shews that he knew of the prior attempted sale to Harris, Forbes & Co. (of which he complains) before the 17th June. He did not then repudiate the purchase. On the contrary, in answer to a telegram of the plaintiffs of the 26th June,\nWhen will you take delivery Albertas? Expect hear from you twenty-fourth.\nDoran wired on the 28th:\u2014\nDelay greatly your fault. Doing best settle matter fast as possible. Impossible settle by twenty-fourth. Will close deal as soon as possible. Expect have situation settled by Friday. Claftin\u2019s failure hurt market. Money situation very bad. If necessary hold bonds subject to prior sale by you.\nSubsequent letters and telegrams from the defendant and Daude put in evidence shew that they con- sidered the contract with the plaintiffs in existence at least down to the 25th July. The first suggestion of repudiation comes from Daude on the 13th August; after the plaintiffs had sent further communications pressing for payment.\nThe only question requiring further consideration is the defence raised by the fourth section of the Statute of Frauds, which admittedly applies to the transaction. Driver v. Broad[16].\nOn the 3rd of June the defendant telegraphed to his representative, or partner, Daude:\u2014\nThe Alberta Bonds which you have particulars of, no one else has for sale. I absolutely bought them yesterday after our \u2019phone conversation, they agreeing to our terms. Put sale through at once.\nThis telegram puts beyond controversy the fact that the defendant purchased the Alberta bonds. It is conceded that the identity of these bonds has been fully established by prior letters signed by the defendant, which also state the names of the vendors, the price, and an arrangement as to commission and place of payment and delivery. The only objection taken to the sufficiency of the telegram of the 3rd June as a memorandum to satisfy the Statute of Frauds is that the phrase, \u201cour terms,\u201d might refer to some terms arranged over the telephone on the previous day other than and in addition to those set forth in the plaintiffs\u2019 original circular offering the bonds for sale, which admittedly formed the basis of negotiations, and is referred to as such in Doran\u2019s letter to Daude of May 26th, repeating some of the particulars, and the subsequent correspondence. A slight reduction of the quantity of the bonds as stated in Doran\u2019s letter of the 26th, the plaintiffs\u2019 assent to the commission for which the defendant stipulated, and the place of pay- ment and delivery are set forth in a telegram from Doran to Daude of the 29th May. There is no suggestion in the evidence that there were any other \u201cterms\u201d of the sale. The phrase, \u201cour terms,\u201d in the telegram of June 3rd, is certainly ambiguous, but, upon the authority of such cases as Baumann v. James[17], Cave v. Hastings[18], and Ridgway v. Wharton[19], I have no doubt that parol evidence was properly received to shew, that terms had been stated by the defendant in writing over his own signature, that there had been no other terms than those so stated, and that it was to the terms so stated that the telegram referred. That evidence has been given and is conclusive.\nOn the 16th of June the defendant wired to Doran as follows:\u2014\nAlberta Bonds must be paid for to-day. McKinnon\u2019s statement shews them worth $227,085.98, less our commission, $2,500.00, or $224,585.98 to them. Answer at once.\nThis telegram clearly refers to and implies a recognition of a statement of McKinnon & Co. Such a statement had been sent to the defendant on the previous day, accompanied by an intimation that the plaintiffs were ready to make delivery, and understood that the defendants would take it on the following day. The statement was in the form of an account, and gave full particulars of the purchase. On the authorities above cited, to which may be added Long v. Millar[20], I have no doubt that the statement referred to in Doran\u2019s telegram to Daude may be identified by parol evidence. I think that Doran\u2019s telegram of the 16th, with McKinnon\u2019s statement of the 15th, contains a sufficient memorandum to meet the require- ments of the statute. It, at all events, supplies any possible deficiency in the earlier documents.\nNo ground has been shewn for a reduction in the damages awarded. The plaintiffs disposed of the bonds with reasonable promptitude, and they made every reasonable effort to obtain the highest possible price for them in order to protect themselves as well as the defendant. There is no evidence that they did not get the full market value or as high a price as could be obtained at any time after the defendant had repudiated his contract.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014It was contended by the appellant that his relations with the respondents were those of principal and agent. But I am unable to concur in such a contention.\nThe plaintiffs (respondents) are bond investment brokers. They were the owners of $230,000 railway bonds, guaranteed by the Alberta Government, and having seen in the newspapers that Mr. Doran, the defendant (appellant), had tendered for $1,000,000 bonds issued by the city of Toronto, approached him with the view of selling to him their bonds.\nThey gave him the price at which they would dispose of those bonds and they told him the allowance or bonus they would give him.\nThe defendant tried to sell those bonds, and he evidently got a better price than the one stipulated for by the respondents, and, without disclosing the name of his alleged principal, he negotiated with the respondents for an outright purchase of the bonds.\nOn the 3rd of June, 1914, he telegraphed to Mr. Daude, his friend or partner in New York, that he had absolutely bought the bonds. With such an admission; it is impossible now for the appellant to say that he acted as agent of the respondents. It is pretty evident that he became the purchaser of those bonds.\nHe was then relying on some negotiations which were being carried on in New York by Mr. Daude for the resale of those bonds. But, unfortunately, those New York negotiations failed, and the European war, which, a few weeks after, was declared, rendered ineffective all efforts he made to dispose of the bonds. Now that he is sued in damages for breach of contract, he claims that there was no memorandum in writing signed by him sufficient to satisfy the Statute of Frauds.\nIt becomes necessary, in order to discuss properly that defence, to go fully into the documents, letters and correspondence filed in the case.\nAt first there was a general circular issued by the respondents; giving the quantity of bonds to be sold, their price and conditions generally.\nThat circular was formally handed to Mr. Doran on the 26th of May, and he was told that the bonds would be sold to him at the price stated in the circular, less one-half of one per cent. That reduction in the price represented a sum of $1,150.\nOn the same day he writes to his associate or friend, Mr. Daude, apprising him of the offer, and asking him to wire him if he could handle those bonds. On the 29th of May he wired to Daude that McKinnon would sell the bonds \u201cless $2,500 to us subject to Toronto payment and delivery.\u201d On the 30th he wires again: \u201cMcKinnon wants confirmation re Alberta Bonds. Answer.\u201d\nOn the 2nd of June the respondents write a letter in the following terms:\u2014 J.J. Doran, Esq., June 2, 1914.\nCrown Office Bldg.,\nToronto, Ont.\nDear Sir,\u2014Following your telephone conversation with our Mr. McKinnon, we take pleasure in confirming to you the sale of $223,700 Province of Alberta (Guaranteed) Bonds, bearing 5%, payable semi-annually, maturing Oct. 22nd, 1943. The price is a rate to yield you 4.95% less an allowance to you of $2,500.00.\nThe legal opinion of J.B. Clarke, K.C., has already been obtained, however, the legal files are not yet completed. Mr. Clarke is at present out of town, and upon his return, which is expected in a few days, we will take the necessary steps to have the legal papers completed and forwarded to you in order that your solicitor may approve legality.\nAssuring you of our appreciation of this our first transaction with you, we are,\nYours very truly,\nW.L. MCKINNON & Co.\nOn the 3rd of June Doran sends the following telegram to Daude:\u2014\nE. Daude,\nHotel Martinique, June 3rd, 1914.\nNew York, N.Y.\nThe Alberta Bonds which you have particulars of, no one else has for sale. I absolutely bought them yesterday after our \u2019phone conversation, they agreeing to our terms. Put sale through at once.\nJ.J. DORAN.\nOn the 5th of June the respondents sent to the appellant the complete legal file mentioned in their previous letter of the 2nd of June.\nHe had them examined by his solicitor, Mr. Fullerton, as appears by the letter of the latter of the 9th of June.\nOn the 15th of June the respondents sent a statement, figured as at the 16th June, shewing as at that date the amount to be paid $224,585.98, and closed their letter by saying:\u2014\nAs we understand that funds are now being transferred here from New York, and that you wish to take delivery to-morrow, we shall try to get in touch with you by telephone in the morning in order to ascertain an hour for delivery to suit your convenience. On the 16th of June Doran sent the following telegram to Daude:\u2014\nH. Daude,\nHotel Martinique,\nNew York, N.Y.\nAlberta Bonds must be paid for to-day. McKinnon statement shews them worth $227,085.98, less our commission, $2,500.00, or $224,585.98 to them. Answer at once.\n(Sgd.) J.J. DORAN.\nRush charge.\nIt is established by the oral evidence given that all those documents have reference to the alleged sale of those Alberta bonds. Those letters and documents, according to my opinion, constitute a memorandum sufficient to satisfy the Statute of Frauds.\nThe correspondence between Doran and Daude is admissible as evidence of the contract of sale. Any note or letter written by a purchaser to a third person containing directions to carry the agreement into execution may be a sufficient memorandum to meet the requirements of the statute. Seagood v. Meale[21] in 1721; Welford v. Beazely[22] in 1747; Gibson v. Holland[23] in 1865; Sugden, Law of Vendors and Purchasers, 14th ed., p. 139; Agnew, Statute of Frauds, p. 244.\nWe have in the present case the circular containing the offer of sale of those bonds. We have also the letter of Doran to Daude of the 26th of May, stating all the conditions at which sale could be made. It is pretty evident, however, that the allowance of $1,150 was not considered attractive enough. They asked a sum of $2,500. The matter of that further reduction was discussed by Doran and McKinnon, and at last the latter yielded, since, on the 3rd of June, Doran informs his agent or associate, Daude, that McKinnon agreed \u201cto our terms.\u201d We see also that that telegram was sent the day after McKinnon wrote a lengthy letter giving all the conditions of the sale. Later on, in the middle of June, Doran is seen urging upon his New York friend to close and send the money.\nThere is no doubt that McKinnon\u2019s letter of the 2nd of June was binding on them; then the subsequent note in writing, signed by Doran, is sufficient to bind them. Parol evidence could be adduced to show that those documents referred the one to the other, and that the contract described by McKinnon is the same as the one accepted by Doran.\nIt is a pretty well-settled rule that when one document refers to another, the two may be read together so as to constitute a complete memorandum. The same rule applies if the documents can be connected together by reasonable inference, although there is no express reference from one document to the other. Halsbury, vol. 7, No. 761.\nOn that question of reference I will quote also the following decisions in support of the respondents\u2019 contentions: Dobell v. Hutchinson[24] in 1835; Ridgway v. Wharton[25] in 1856; Baumann v. James[26] in 1868; Long v. Millar[27] in 1879; Cave v. Hastings, 1881[28]. In so far as I have been able to find, these decisions have never been overruled, and are accepted as the settled law of the land. The appellant relied mostly on: Pierce v. Corf[29] in 1874; Taylor v. Smith[30] in 1892; Potter v. Peters[31] in 1895. In those three cases the documents contain no reference to one another, and could not be connected by reasonable inference from the circumstances of the case. They have never been considered, however, as overruling the decision rendered by the House of Lords in the case of Ridgway v. Wharton[32].\nThe case of Potter v. Peters29 was decided by His Lordship Mr. Justice Kekewich, in 1895, the same judge who, in 1887, rendered judgment in the case of Wylson v. Dunn[33], where a letter, not referring expressly to a former one, contained the declaration that he was willing to take half an acre of the land \u201cas agreed upon,\u201d was held, however, as containing a sufficient reference to form a valid contract within the Statute of Frauds.\nIn Taylor v. Smith30 an invoice of the goods was sent by the plaintiffs to the defendant, and the carrier also sent an advice note to inform him of the arrival of the goods. That advice note specified the quantity of goods, but did not state their price nor refer to the invoice or any other document. The defendant, after inspection, wrote on the advice note: \u201cRejected; not according to representation.\u201d It was held that there was not a sufficient note of the bargain as required by the Statute of Frauds.\nNo reference was made by the judges who decided Taylor v. Smith30 to Ridgway v. Wharton32. One of the judges has referred, however, to the case of Long v. Millar[34], which I have quoted above, and said the case of Taylor v. Smith30 wanted the main element to be found in the Millar Case34, viz., the existence in a document signed by the defendant of words referring to a contract of purchase.\nI have, then, come to the conclusion that the appellant, in the present case, fails, and that his appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: James S.

[1906] c. 140, s. 20 (b) and (c).\nTo make the Crown liable, under sub-sec. (c) of section 20 of the \"Exchequer Court Act\" (R.S.C. [1906] ch. 140), for injury to property, such property must be on a public work when injured. Chamberlin v. The King (40 Can. S.C.R. 350) and Paul v. The King (38 Can. S.C.R. 126) followed. Letourneau v. The King (33 Can. S.C.R. 335) overruled.\nInjury to property by an explosion of dynamite on property adjoining a public work is not \"damage to property injuriously affected by the construction of a public work\" under sec. 20 (b) of the Act.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada dismissing the suppliants' Petition of Right.\nServants of the Crown engaged in building a cement dock on the Detroit River caused damage to suppliants' dock adjoining the work by their blasting operations. The suppliants claimed damages by Petition of Right, which was dismissed by the Exchequer Court for want of jurisdiction. They then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nW. L. Scott for the appellants referred to Letourneux v. The King[1] Newcombe K.C. for the respondent cited Paul v. The King[2]; Chamberlin v. The King[3].\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The appellants brought their Petition of Right to recover damages against the Crown for injuries alleged to have been caused to their dock through negligence in the course of the work of constructing a public dock 100 feet from the premises of the petitioners.\nThe \"Exchequer Court Act\" provides, section 20 (so far as material) :\u2014\nThe Exchequer Court shall also have exclusive original jurisdiction to hear and determine the following matters:\u2014\n(a) Every claim against the Crown for property taken for any public purpose;\n(b) Every claim against the Crown for damage to property injuriously affected by the construction of any public work;\n(c) Every claim against the Crown arising out of any death or injury to the person or to property on any public work resulting from the negligence of any officer or servant of the Crown, while acting within the scope of his duties or employment.\nAt the trial it was pointed out by the Judge of the Exchequer Court that, excepting by statute, the Crown was not liable for wrongs committed by its servants, and that section 20 (c) of the \"Exchequer Court Act,\" the only statutory provision imposing such liability, did so only in the case of injury to property on any public work.\nThe appellants now seek to rest their case upon section 20 (b) of the Ad. This, however, is to confuse two kinds of action of entirely different nature. Paragraphs (a) and (b) of section 20 are dealing with questions of compensation, not of damages.\nCompensation is the indemnity which the statute provides to the owner of lands which are compulsorily taken in, or injuriously affected by, the exercise of statutory powers.\nFor acts done in pursuance of statutory powers there can be no damages, for, the acts being made lawful by the statute, the doing of them can occasion no wrong. For loss occasioned by the doing of such acts compensation is the remedy provided by statute.\nIt is clear that in the case of a private company or individual committing such acts as those alleged in the petition of right, the appellants would have had their remedy in an action for damages. The Crown, however, cannot be sued for what would, between subjects be a wrong done, except in so far as provided by statute.\nIt follows that the appellants cannot establish a claim either to compensation under paragraph (b) or to damages under paragraph (c) of section 20 of the \"Exchequer Court Act,\" and their action accordingly fails.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nDavies J.\u2014I think this appeal must be dismissed with costs as being directly within the construction of the \"Exchequer Court Act\" laid down by this court in the cases of Paul v. The King[4] and Chamberlin v. The King[5].\nIdington J.\u2014When the \"Petition of Right Act,\" 1875, 38 Vict. ch. 12, was passed, it recited the expediency of making provision for proceeding by way of petition of right, and to assimilate the proceedings on such petitions, as well as in suits by the Crown, to the course of practice and procedure in force in actions and suits between subject and subject.\nIt enacted by the first clause thereof that the petition should set forth with convenient certainty the facts entitling the suppliant to relief.\nThat held out a very comprehensive purpose of relief, but by section 8 there was, in a section that began in an equally comprehensive spirit outlining the practice and procedure to be applied, the following proviso:\u2014\nNothing in this Act shall be construed to give to the subject any remedy against the Crown, in any case in which he would not have been entitled to such remedy in England under similar circumstances by the laws then in force there prior to the passing of the Imperial statute, 23 and 24 Victoria chapter 34, intituled, \"An Act to amend the law relating to Petitions of Right to simplify the proceedings and to make provisions for the costs hereof.\"\nIt was intended by other parts of that Act to execute its purposes by and through the ordinary courts of the province. In consequence of the establishment of this court immediately after such enactment, combined with a power of exercising the functions of an exchequer court, that Act was repealed by 39 Vict. ch. 27, sec. 1. And the jurisdiction to try such Petitions of Right was allotted to the Exchequer Court.\nBy section 19 of that statute, there was, amongst other things, enacted that it was not to give to the subject any remedy against the Crown save in such cases as embraced in above quoted proviso.\nBy the later development of the jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court, when separated from this court, it so turned out that the limits of relief under the \"Petition of Right Act\" were confined to the jurisdiction given that court.\nIndeed, it has inadvertently, as I submit, been sometimes said that court had been given not only a jurisdiction, but that its provisions created a right to relief as well as supplied a remedy.\nThe measure of relief intended by the \"Petition of Right Act\" was, I think, wider than that jurisdiction, but, inasmuch as the jurisdiction given in the Exchequer Court was the only jurisdiction to try any such claims, the only practical relief given was that assigned by the said \"Exchequer Court Act.\"\nThe result has been to limit by the jurisdiction given the only relief, and that is less than, though probably intended to be coterminous with, the relief given in the Imperial Act above quoted.\nIt would be impossible properly to extend the express language of the jurisdiction given, by means of any section denying the right to be greater than something else.\nThe absurdity has continued for many years, and probably justice has often been thereby denied.\nThe sub-section (c) of section 2 of the \"Exchequer Court Act\" under which the appellant seeks relief reads as follows:\u2014\n(c) Every claim against the Crown arising out of any death or injury to the person or to property on any public work resulting from the negligence of any officer or servant of the Crown while acting within the scope of his duties or employment.\nThis case illustrates what a stupid enactment this is.\nThe words therein, \"on any public work,\" rendered it impossible, in the case of Chamberlin v. The King[6], for us to interfere, solely because the injury, if any, was done to property a long distance from the place where the public work existed from which it was said the cause of the destruction of suppliant's property originated. The cause of the ir jury there in question was alleged to be the issuing of fire from an improperly constructed or guarded smoke stack.\nThe court below had therein found there was, in fact, no well-grounded cause of complaint, but the suppliant had a right to have us rehear the case and determine the merits of the appeal if there had been jurisdiction in the Exchequer Court.\nHe was in law properly refused, and the decision was put, I suspect, upon the ground of jurisdiction alone not only as a proper way of disposing of the appeal, but a means of bringing home \"to others the actual condition of the law.\nThe learned trial judge herein has followed, properly as I conceive, that decision.\nThis case illustrates how absurd and barbarous the law is.\nIf counsel for the suppliant states correctly the facts, then the servants of the Crown negligently used dynamite in such a way as to blow up a pier belonging to the suppliant.\nThe property owned by the suppliant and by the Crown formed at the time parts of a long pier, of which it was desired by the Crown to destroy part of that which it had acquired and, in doing so, unintentionally, I assume, destroyed part of that same work which had passed into the suppliant's possession.\nWhat right would any private owner ever imagine he could have to use dynamite under such circumstances until he had severed clearly and completely the connection between the properties so that there could be no risk of such consequences as alleged?\nHowever that may be in fact, there can be no question that, under the plain language of the sub-section, dynamite or other explosive might be so used on such a property as to smash to pieces men and property lawfully beside it, and neither owner nor representative could recover for such damages.\nThe men guilty might be prosecuted criminally and sent to prison, but civil damages there could be none recoverable under this sub-section (c).\nAnd all that, I suspect, comes of someone confusing provisions relative to Crown property found in the statutes preceding this with other subject matters that had to be provided for.\nI cannot put the construction Mr. Scott asks us to put on the word \"construction\" in the preceding subsection, and get out of the difficulty that way.\nIt was destruction the respondent's servants were engaged in, and not even construction in a sense different from that for which I think the word stands as I read it in sub-section (b).\nI respectfully submit that the sooner the probably misplaced words, \"on any public work,\" are stricken out of sub-section (c) the better.\nI think the appeal must be dismissed, but should we give costs? I think not.\nAnglin J.\u2014I respectfully concur in the reasons assigned by the learned judge of the Exchequer Court for dismissing this action. Since the decisions in Chamberlin v. The King[7] and Paul v. The King[8], Letourneux v. The King[9] is not authority for maintaining such an action. As to clause (b) of section 20 of the \"Exchequer Court Act,\" invoked in this court by the suppliant, damage to property sustained in the course of construction of a public work through negligence or otherwise is not \"damage to property injuriously affected by the construction\" of such public work.\nBrodeur J.\u2014The claim made against the Crown may result from the negligence of its officers, but does not arise out of an injury \"on any public work.\"\nThere has been a long series of decisions of this court to the effect that the provisions of section 20, sub-section (c), of the \"Exchequer Court Act\" render the Crown liable for injury to property only when the property is situated on a public work. City of Quebec v. The Queen[10]; Larose v. The King[11]; Paul v. The King[12]; Chamberlin v. The King[13].\nIt may be that the provisons of the section have not been given a very wide construction by those decisions, but the latter seem to have been accepted by Parliament, since no legislation has ever been passed to extend the jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court to all claims for damages arising from the negligence of a servant of the Crown while acting within the scope of his duties on a public work.\nUntil such legislation is passed, we are bound by these decisions, and it is then necessary for the plaintiffs, if they sue for damages, to shew that the injury to their property has occurred on a public work.\nTheir appeal fails because they have been unable to prove such injury.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Rodd, Wigle & McHugh.\nSolicitor for the respondent: T.

C.\nAfter heavy rains, in cold weather, had coated trees and electric wires with icicles, a violent wind tore a branch from a tree, growing on private grounds, and blew it a distance of 33 feet on to a highway where it fell across the defendants' electric transmission wire, causing a high-tension current to escape to secondary house-supply wires, used only for low-tension currents, and resulting in the destruction of the buildings by fire. The high-tension current, 2,200 volts, was stepped down from the primary wire to about 110 volts on the secondary wires by means of a transformer which was not grounded, owing to doubts then existing as to doing so being safe practice. The secondary wires were used by the defendants to supply electric light to consumers, the owners of the buildings destroyed, but these buildings were not fitted with \"modern\" installations for electric lighting nor with cut-offs to intercept high-tension currents.\u2014V's action was to recover damages for the destruction of his building, alleged to have been occasioned by the defendants' defective system. The insurance companies, being subrogated in the rights of owners of buildings insured by them, brought actions to recover the amounts of the policies which had been paid.\nHeld, per Idington, Anglin and Brodeur JJ. (Davies and Duff JJ. contra.) Under the provisions of article 1054 of the Civil Code, the defendants were liable for the damages claimed as they had failed to establish that they were unable, in the circumstances, to prevent the escape of the high-tension electric current, a dangerous thing under their care, which had been the cause of the injuries, or that the injuries thus caused had resulted from the fault of the owners of the buildings themselves. The defence of vis major was not open as the circumstances in which the injuries occurred could have been foreseen and provided against by the installation of a safer system for transmission of electricity.\nJudgment appealed from (Q. R. 24 K. B. 214), reversed, Davies and Duff JJ. dissenting.\nPer Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\u2014As the special Acts under which the defendants carried on their operations provide that the company shall be \"responsible for all damages which its agents, servants, or workmen cause to individuals or property in carrying out or maintaining any of its said works \"(58 & 59 Vict. (D.) ch. 59, sec. 13), and that the company \"shall be responsible for all damages which it may cause in carrying out its works\" (44 & 45 Vict. (Que.) ch. 71, sec. 2), they are liable for damages resulting from the operation of their constructed works, without regard to any consideration of fault or negligence on their part.\nPer Davies and Duff JJ., dissenting.\u2014Under article 1054 of the Civil Code, the onus lies upon the plaintiff to prove that the injury complained of resulted from the fault of the thing which the defendant had under his care; in the absence of such proof there is no liability on the part of the defendant. In the circumstances of the case the defendants are entitled to succeed on the ground that the damages were the result of vis major. Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Roy ((1902) A. C. 220); Dumphy v. Montreal Light, Heat and Power Co. ((1907) A. C. 454); McArthur v. Dominion Cartridge Co. ((1905) A. C. 72); Shawinigan Carbide Co. v. Doucet (Can. S. C. R. 281; Q. R. 18 K. B. 271); and Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Dionne (14 Rev. de Jur. 474), referred to.\nAPPEALS from the judgments of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side[1] reversing the judgments of Dorion J, in the Superior Court, District of Quebec, and dismissing the actions with costs.\nThe circumstances in which the actions were instituted are stated in the head-note and the questions in issue on the present appeals are discussed in the judgments now reported.\nL. A. Taschereau K.C. and Cannon K.C. for the appellants.\nG. G. Stuart K.C. for the respondents.\nDavies J. (dissenting).\u2014 Notwithstanding the enormous mass of testimony which appears to have been given in these cases and the great number of points raised by the plaintiffs on which it is contended that the defendants should be held liable, it seems to me that the real substantial questions are reduced to very few.\u2014First, whether there was evidence of negligence on the part of the defendant company in not grounding their transformer secondary wires, or other negligence which was an effective cause of the damages complained of, and next whether the company is liable for these damages irrespective of proof of negligence under the statute 58 & 59 Vict., ch. 13, under which they were carrying on their operations and under articles 1053 and 1054 of the Civil Code of Quebec.\nThe case of the plaintiff Vandry and the four other appeals, by insurance companies which are suing as having been subrogated to the rights of the parties whose houses they had insured, depend upon the same facts and are the result of fires which took place on the 19th and 20th of December, 1912, which the appellants contend, as I think rightly, were caused by an electric current supplied by the respondents for the lighting of the burnt buildings. As to the contention that, without proof of fault or negligence, absolute liability of the company is established under article 1054 C.C. upon its being proved that the damage sued for was caused by a \"thing which it had under its care\" or because, as contended, the company failed to prove that it was unable to prevent the act which caused the damage, I am in full accord with the judgment of the court of appeal which, as I understand it, is that fault or negligence causing or contributing to the accident on the part of the defendant company not having been proved, they are not liable for damages.\nThe question, to my mind, resolves itself into this:\u2014Whether the respondent company can be held responsible for damages resulting from the exercise of its statutory powers where no negligence on its part is proved.\nIn the case of Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Roy[2], it was held by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council that:\nA railway company authorized by statute to carry on its railway undertaking in the place and by the means adopted is not responsible in damages for injury not caused by negligence, but by the ordinary and normal use of its railway; or, in other words, by the proper execution of the power conferred by the statute.\nThe previous state of the common law imposing liability cannot render, inoperative the positive enactment of a statute. Neither the Civil Code of Lower Canada, art. 356, nor the Dominion \"Railway Act,\" ss. 92, 288, on their true construction, contemplates the liability of a railway company acting within its statutory powers:\u2014\nSo held, where the respondent had suffered damage caused by sparks escaping from one of the appellant's locomotive engines while employed in the ordinary use of its railway.\nLater, in the case of Dumphy v. Montreal Light, Heat and Power Co.[3], the Judicial Committee held that the respondents, being authorized by Quebec Act, 1 Edw. VII. ch. 66, sec. 10, in the alternative, to place their wires either overhead or underground, were not guilty of negligence In adopting one alternative rather than the other, or in neglecting to insulate or guard the wires in the absence of evidence that such precaution would have been effectual to avert the accident.\nEach of these decisions was based on the ground that proof of negligence or fault causing the injuries complained of was essential to entitle a person injured to recover damages caused by the exercise by a company of its statutory powers.\nThe current of decisions in this court has, I think, been uniform to the same effect and no decision that I am aware of can be found to the contrary, supporting the proposition now contended for under article 1054 of the Civil Code.\nThere must be\" evidence proving the existence of fault on the part of the defendant, or, at any rate, since the decision of the Privy Council in the case McArthur v. Dominion Cartridge Company[4], from which the tribunal may reasonably and fairly infer both the existence of the fault and its connection with the injury complained of.\nThen, as to the contention that sub-section (e) of section 13 of the Dominion Act incorporating the company and under which it was operating declared the company should be\nresponsible for all damages which its agents, servants or workmen caused to individuals or property in carrying out or maintaining any of its said works,\nI would apply the language used by The Lord Chancellor in delivering the judgment of the Privy Council in the case of Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Roy[5] at page 231. Section 288 (of the \"Railway Act\" of 1888) is more plausibly argued to have maintained the liability of the company, notwithstanding the statutory permission to use the railway; but if one looks at * * * the great variety of provisions which give ample materials for the operation of that section, it would be straining the words unduly to give it a construction which would make it repugnant, and authorize in one part of the statute what is made an actionable wrong in another. It would reduce the legislation to an absurdity, and their Lordships are of opinion that it cannot be so construed.\nBut whatever may be the meaning of the language of this clause (e) it cannot, in my opinion, be construed so as to embrace or cover such an accident as we have proved in this case, one caused by force majeure and without negligence on the part of the respondent company.\nThe substantial, if not the only ground on which the plaintiffs could hope to establish negligence on the part of the company was the non-grounding of the transformer secondary wires.\nThe company, in erecting its poles along the roadside and supplying electricity to light the houses whose owners or occupants desired to have it, was admittedly doing so in the exercise of a statutory power authorizing it to carry electricity on wires attached to poles on any public road in the vicinity of Quebec.\nIn the operation which it was so carrying on, it was doing that which the statute authorized.\nThe trial judge distinctly found that, with the above exception of this non-grounding, none of the complaints made against the condition of the line were well founded.\nThe company's contention was, and it seems to me to be proved, that its wires were strung along poles placed on the St. Foy Road, on the highway, and were in good order and condition, that on the night on which appellant's house was destroyed a large branch of a tree growing on the property of Victor Chateauvert one of the parties insured and whose rights became subrogated to the Queen Insurance Company, one of the plaintiffs, was, as the result of a great wind and sleet storm, blown off the tree and carried out to the highway upon the respondents' wires bringing the primary wire, with its high-tension current, into contact with the secondary. The tree was approximately 90 feet high and the branch which broke was at a measured distance of 63 feet from the ground. It was a branch growing upwards in a westerly direction and at the time it broke was covered with a thick coating of ice and driven by a wind which attained a speed of 38 miles an hour. The respondent defendants further contended that if the wiring of the house had been properly done and efficiently maintained, instead of being as it was most defective, no injury probably would have resulted even if the high-tension current had been introduced into the house.\nIt was also proved that the defendants (respondents), were in no way responsible for the house wiring. That was a matter entirely within the duty of the plaintiffs (appellants).\nThe primary wires, three in number, were strung from pole to pole upon cross-bars, and the secondary wires, two in number, were strung some distance beneath them on other cross-bars.\nThe tree on Chateauvert's property from which the branch broke off was in a field at a distance of 22 feet 6 inches from the road-fence and a few feet further from the centre of the pole line. To reach the primary wires it was contended the branch must have been carried a distance of 33 feet 6 inches and this could only be done by an extremely violent wind and by the broken branch sliding along the lower branches of the tree, all of which were heavily coated with ice. The tree and the branch were shewn to have been sound, without any visible weakness and defect, and the branch, some 9 feet in length, was one of the exhibits in the case produced before this court.\nThe majority of the court of appeal was of the opinion that nothing was shewn to have existed which should have caused any one to anticipate the occurrence of such an accident as happened, that it was one for which respondent defendants were in no way responsible and that, in view of the proved defective condition of the interior wiring of the burnt buildings for which the respondents were not responsible, the grounding of the transformer would instead of being a protection have been rather an added danger.\nAfter hearing the argument at bar and reading the evidence of the different experts and engineers on the point of this grounding and the correspondence between the defendants' manager, and Mr. Bennett, in December, 1911, on the same question, I have reached the same conclusion as the court of appeal, namely, that while electrical expert opinion is strongly in favour of the grounding of the transformer secondary wires as a protection and safeguard against accidents happening from the possible contact of the primary wire with the secondary wires in cases where the inside wiring of the houses is good, such grounding would not be a safeguard or protection with respect to houses the inside wiring of which was as bad and defective as it was shewn to have been in this case.\nBeing of the opinion, therefore, that the respondents, in the exercise of their statutory powers, were not responsible in damages for injuries not caused by negligence on their part; that no such negligence was or could be found on the facts of this case; that the accident which happened and brought the primary and secondary wires into contact and carried the high-tension current of the former into the houses was caused by the branch of a tree being blown off and carried, by force of a high wind in a sleet storm, some distance out to the highway and on to the wires and was an accident which they could not have anticipated and for which they should not be held responsible, and against which no precaution has been suggested which they could or ought to have taken; and that the injuries caused to the plaintiff might have been avoided if the inside wiring of his house had not been bad and defective, a condition for which he alone is responsible, I would dismiss this and the other appeals with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014Notwithstanding the voluminous material of law and fact presented for consideration herein, and over two days of argument spent in enlightening us as to the bearing thereof, I think that to be decided in the case is within a very narrow compass, when we accept as proven that which every fair-minded person seems to have assumed, and eliminate that which is either irrelevant or immaterial.\nYet, as will presently appear, from my point of view there are some things relevant to what has to be decided which one should have desired to know more about than is presented in evidence or has been dealt with in argument.\nPassing meantime these considerations it seems abundantly clear that the property in question was destroyed by the force of an electric current of 2,200 volts passing into the premises in question which no one could ever have imagined had been prepared to receive and resist the ill effects of more than a current of one hundred and eight to one hundred and fifty volts of electric current.\nIt is equally clear that this was produced by reason of a large branch of a tree breaking and being blown by the wind upon the wire of respondent. The danger of such a thing happening was so well recognized by those engaged in the business that experts, including respondent's witness Mr. Herdt, hereinafter quoted on other points, tell us without hesitation or contradiction that those so engaged out of necessity for safety seek to have the trees near to their wires removed or so trimmed as to avert or ameliorate such damages.\nEverything, therefore, urged in law or in fact as an impediment to the application of such means of safety rendered it the more incumbent upon the respondent to secure, by other means, the protection of life and property where it carried on its operations.\nThe freezing of rain falling upon the trees at certain seasons in Canada and consequent destruction of their branches by force of wind operating upon them when so laden is too frequent an occurrence to escape the attention of any intelligent person.\nThe possibility of the branches being in such circumstances carried from tall trees a much greater distance than anything involved herein should be so obvious to any Canadian, keeping his eyes open, that it is hardly necessary to dilate upon that incidental feature appearing in this case and becoming a subject of grave argument.\nIn short, the case is reduced to the consideration of a few facts and the law bearing thereon.\nThe respondent is engaged in the business of lighting by means of electricity. It produces electric current for distribution. In order to divide the current generated therefor it uses transformers whereby the main electric force is reduced to such fractions thereof as may be conducted with safety into houses or other places to be lighted by means of lamps it supplies for the purpose. These fractional currents, if I may so speak, are conducted by one wire, or set of wires, whilst the main or primary current is carried upon another wire. Both wires are carried overhead by means of same set of poles and cross-arms and should be so far apart as to avoid the dangers of induction of current from one to the other.\nIt is alleged and, I incline to think, supported by some evidence that the respondent's primary and secondary wires were strung too close together. In my view of the case I have not found it necessary to reach a definite opinion upon that disputed fact. I therefore eliminate it from what is necessary to be considered.\nThe naked facts are that the branch of a tree (which might, under the circumstances I have adverted to, be so expected to fall and, hence, had to be guarded against) falling upon these wires, caused in the absence of the use of a grounding at the transformer, the current of 2,200 volts to be carried in the primary wire to pass into the secondary wire md thereby to the houses only prepared or supposed to be only prepared to resist, or rather receive with safety, a current of one hundred and eight volts.\nThe result in each house in question herein was a fire and destruction of property.\nThe appellant Vandry was indemnified for part of his loss by the insurance companies which, in turn, were subrogated for him in respect of so much thereof as so paid, and they sue by virtue of such subrogations.\nOther companies claim in subrogation of the other sufferers. Nothing turns upon the question of subrogation beyond one or two points of procedure and costs to be referred to hereafter.\nThe learned trial judge held the respondent liable mainly, if not entirely, upon the ground that there was a means well known to the respondent which it ought to have adopted, but did not adopt, to provide for just such probable contingencies as happened, and, for the reasons I already have given, were likely to happen.\nThat means was the grounding at the transformer of the secondary wire whereby the augmented current therein caused by the accident would have been conducted to earth instead of into the houses in question.\nThe means, of insuring safety by grounding secondary wires at the transformer is thus referred to by Mr. Herdt, one of the respondent's scientific expert witnesses, as follows:\u2014\nQ. You also add that this practice has been carried into effect very generally by most large operating companies?\nA. Yes, sir.\nQ. That was to your personal knowledge?\nA. Yes, to my personal knowledge.\nQ. For how many years prior to this letter, had this practice been carried into effect by the large operating companies, as stated by you in your letter?\nA. Some of the large operating companies have started grounding transformer secondaries early in 1900, 1902 or 1903, but it has taken them years to carry that out.\nQ. But the grounding of transformers was being put into effect by large operating companies ten years prior to your letter?\nA. Ten years; hardly ten years.\nQ. That is what you have said. You have said twelve years even?\nA. It was started.\nQ. It was started in or about 1900?\nA. In 1902 or 1903.\nQ. So, for ten years that had been going on?\nA. For ten years that had been going on.\nThe results are testified to by same witness as follows:\u2014 A. Do I personally know of any case where the inside wiring is good and the transformer grounded?\nQ. Yes?\nA. No, I do not know of any case.\nQ. So in all the cases that you are aware of, or that come to your knowledge, when the transformer was grounded and the inside wiring being good, no fire started?\nA. No. If I know of any case?\nQ. Yes?\nA. No, I do not.\nThe only answer made thereto which seems worth a moment's consideration is that in the case of a defectively wired house there would be a possibility of increasing thereby the danger to life and property therein.\nIt was further alleged that the houses in question were of the defectively wired class. But how is that an answer? Had the respondent any right to venture to supply light to such a house? Where in its charter or in law can it find justification for doing so? The means for determining whether or not a house is of that character is referred to by Mr. Herdt, its own witness, as follows:\nQ. I am very sorry to say that all that happened. Now I understand that there are some special instruments to test the wiring in a private dwelling?\nA. Yes.\nA. Are they expensive instruments?\nCounsel for defendant objects to this question.\nA. No.\nQ. These tests may be easily made by the electrical company?\nQ. Very easily.\nQ. Easily made?\nA. Easily made.\nQ. And it is a perfectly safe test?\nA. Perfectly safe test.\nQ. If the wiring will hold that test, then the transformer can be grounded without any trouble?\nA. Well, the different companies may have different methods of testing, different requirements of testing; but generally speaking, the insulation resistance test is not a difficult one to make.\nQ. So as an electrical engineer, you know of not only one method of testing, but of several good methods of testing? A. Yes.\nQ. And if the wiring will pass that test, why, you can recommend the grounding of the transformer?\nA. Yes, sir.\nQ. As a safety device for life and fire?\nA. Yes, sir.\"\nAnd Mr. Wilson, another of its witnesses, says\nQ. It is quite easy for the electrical company to test the wiring of the houses as you do in Montreal?\nA. Yes, they can test to find out if there is ground, easy enough.\nQ. And your practice in Montreal is to refuse current to any house that will not stand the test?\nA. Well, we have to cut them off.\nQ. So that good wiring won't suffer for the bad?\nA. We exact now a certificate from the Fire Underwriters to connect the thing.\nAnd this condition of things had prevailed in Montreal, he tells us, since 1909, about four years before this accident.\nSurely the distance between Montreal and Quebec is not so great as to have prevented the intelligence of what was known at the former place to have reached the understanding of those in the latter place conducting a business wherein it became their bounden duty in law to recognize the advancement of scientific knowledge and the results of experience in order that they might exercise due care and have some regard to the protection of the lives and property of others.\nMr. Wilson tells us that previous to 1905 they had been so unfortunate as to have had two or three people killed by primaries and secondaries coming into contact.\nSuppose there had been someone killed instead of only a fire occasioned by the neglect of duty on the part of the respondent's management, and the manager had been placed on trial for manslaughter and the evidence herein, and especially of his perversity, spread out in his correspondence with Mr. Bennett appealing to him for a change of methods and practice, had been adduced, I am puzzled to know what answer he could have made to such a charge. Yet substantially the question here involved and that in the case I put are the same. The only difference is that one depends on the interpretation to be put upon two articles of the Code designed to secure a remedy for those suffering from the neglect of others and in the Criminal Code is expressed in sections 247 and 262 combined in slightly different language.\nI can understand the case of a man in the situation of Vandry having contracted himself out of any recourse against the respondent. That, however, is not pretended here. All we can infer from what appears is that there must have been a contractual relation between the respondent and someone to light, by means of electricity, the premises in question in each case.\nIt was the duty of respondent to have seen to it when applied to for such a service that it could perform the service with something like reasonable safety for life and property.\nWas this appellant Vandry or his tenant the Hunt Club the applicant for the service herein? So far as the printed case goes I am unable to discover. He had bought the property from the club in February, 1912, and agreed to lease it to the club. He had apparently been a member of the club when, in 1909, the work was done of installing electrical appliances therein, and I gather had been on a committee having to do with letting that contract.\nIf the relations between the parties had been more accurately and definitely put in evidence it would have been more satisfactory.\nIn many cases of negligence the legal relationship between the parties concerned must be examined with care. The nature and quality of the act or omission called negligence can only in many such cases be determined as result of such examination.\nThe relation between a company like the respondent and a tenant can hardly as of course and of necessity explain away all the rights of the owner seeking relief against negligent conduct of the company towards him such as in evidence herein.\nIf the tenant and company were both found to have entered, without his permission, into any enterprise endangering the premises, that would not of itself answer the claim of the owner.\nAs this phase of the matter was not presented in argument and the evidence is far from clear, the only use I wish to make of it is by way of illustration of how little there is, when one comes to consider the respondent's pretentions in the answer it makes, relative to the failure to protect by grounding the wire.\nIn such a case as I put, and as possibly in fact exists herein, there could be found no excuse for attempting to supply electric current without testing to see if the fixtures were sufficient to ensure safety when protected by means of grounding. If so found it could and should protect by grounding. Otherwise it should, out of regard to the lives and property of others, refuse to turn its dangerous machine's destructive forces upon the property.\nIt seems, from the evidence, clearly established that when this course is pursued there is practically no danger of fire or loss to any one; save in the possible loss to the company of the possible profits derivable from an undesirable customer. It should never be forgotten that in such case the safety of adjacent properties either not using electric lights, or using them with the very best electrical fixtures available, are all jeopardized by following any other course.\nI think the duty was the same in the case of any one applying as owner for lighting to be done, unless the owner contracted to assume the risk.\nThe owner's ignorance is generally as great, when he contracts for such service, as if he had never been consulted, as in the case I put of a tenant doing so behind his back as it were. But even in such a case what right has the respondent or any like company to endanger adjacent properties of others? The franchise given by its charter never was intended to permit such a course of conduct.\nAgain in the case of any one being applied to, who is supposed to possess skill in his business, to undertake anything for someone relying upon his skill, he is not generally supposed to presume that the man he is to serve knows as much as he. If he neglects to inform him of the risks he runs he is negligent of his duty in the premises.\nHow much more must that be implied in the case of one who has to answer for his conduct under article 1054 of the Civil Code?\nAgain, it has been well pointed out by Mr. Justice Carroll (if he is right in assuming the rules appearing in the case apply to respondent's contract), one of the rules it requires to be observed is:\u2014\nThe consumer is not permitted to make additions or alteration in his installation without receiving the written consent of the company.\nThis seems to pre-suppose an inspection and a contract in relation to the existing features as the basis of acting.\nAssuming, for argument's sake, the answer made which I have been considering to present something arguable, I am far from accepting the view presented by counsel for respondent relative to the facts as bearing out his argument.\nThe report of Morissette looks as if many things had to be rectified, but that was a year before the fire and what happened meantime I cannot assume to have been complete neglect of the report and its requirements and I cannot find it satisfactorily explained in a way to support the contention.\nNor does the evidence seem to bear out the suggestion of its construction being old, as it seems to have been done over in 1909 under a contract intended to satisfy the underwriter.\nIn my view, however, this does not matter for it certainly, even if all that is claimed by respondent, would not prove that the best wiring would have prevented a fire with a current of 2,200 volts which it seems to be admitted entered the house as result of the accident.\nI, however, do not find the respondent excused thereby. I think it might well be found guilty of negligence under article 1053 C.C. But, at all events, under article 1054 C.C. it clearly was negligent and has not upon the evidence been excused in any way.\nI see no difficulty in the pleading which is comprehensive enough to cover either case the evidence fits.\nI think article 1054 C.C. fits the pleading and the proof. And both pleading and facts adduced in proof thereof peculiarly fit the case for which article 1054 was framed.\nI am not disposed to fritter away the effect which should be given and I think was intended to be given respectively to the admirable and comprehensive articles 1053 and 1054 C.C. for the respective situations to which each is applicable.\nThe respondent failed in its obvious duty under the then well known results of experience and the advancement of scientific knowledge, to take proper precautions.\nIt had no right in law to attempt to shift, as it did, long before this accident now in question, the responsibility devolving upon it under the law in such circumstance or await the result of a public prosecution by way of indictment for continuing a public nuisance.\nIt should have refused to undertake anything so easily discoverable as likely to endanger the property of others and constitute an indictable nuisance and must be assumed to have run the risk of negligently so proceeding.\nTo appeal to force majeure as a defence under such circumstances seems an idle confusion of thought.\nThe judgment in the case of The Canadian Pacific Railway Company v. Roy[6], relied on by respondent, at foot of page 230 and top of page 231, disposes, in the following sentence, of all that rests therein:\u2014\nThe permission, of course, does not authorize the thing to be don\/?\/ negligently or even unnecessarily to cause damage to others.\nThis was, if ever there was, an unnecessarily causing of damage.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the court of appeal and the judgment of the trial judge be restored.\nThe question of procedure invoked by the respondent is one with which we never interfere unless something more than costs is involved and that is all that seems to me in that regard involved herein.\nDuff J. (dissenting).\u2014I have throughout used the word \"appellants\" as if the actions had been brought on behalf of the owners of the property and that it was the owners who are now appealing to this court.\nThe first question to be decided turns upon the effect of certain statutory provisions upon which the appellants rely. The principal Act of the respondent company is ch. 59, of 58 & 59 Vict. (1895), in which the undertaking of the company (then known as the Quebec Montmorency and Charlevoix Railway Company) was declared to be a work for the general advantage of Canada and by which it was further declared that that Act and the \"Railway Act\" of Canada should apply to the company and its undertaking instead of certain statutes of Quebec. The statute of 1895 was amended by chap. 85 of 62 & 63 Vict. (1899), and by this statute the name of the company was changed to the name which it now bears. By the Act of 1895 the company was authorized to \"construct, work and maintain\" a railway in, among other places, the streets of Quebec and telegraph and telephone lines; and extensive compulsory powers were granted for these purposes. By section 2 of the Act of 1899 the company was authorized to:\u2014\n(A) \" manufacture, furnish, use and sell or lease in the city and district of Quebec, light, heat and motive power, generated from electricity, and construct, acquire, work and carry on any lines of wires, tubes or other apparatus for conducting electricity either by land or water;\n(B) \" acquire lands, water powers and watercourses, and erect, use and manage works, machinery and plant for the generation, transmission and distribution of electrical power and energy;\n(C) \" build power houses and stations for the development of electrical force and energy, and acquire the factories or stations of other like companies, or lease their works, equipments, appurtenances and power;\n(D) \"acquire any exclusive rights in letters patent, franchises or patent rights for the purposes of the works and undertakings hereby authorized, and again dispose of such rights.\"\nFor the first time apparently, the appellants raised the point in this court that section 13(e) of the Act of 1895 has the effect of imposing upon the respondent company an absolute responsibility for harm arising from the working of the company's undertaking. I quote section 13 in full:\nSection 13:\u2014With the consent of the municipal council or other authority having jurisdiction over the roads and streets of any city, town, municipality or district, the company may, by its servants, agents or workmen enter upon any public road, highway, street, bridge, watercourse, navigable or non-navigable water or other such places in any city, incorporated town, village, county, municipality, district, or other place, for the purpose of constructing, erecting, equipping, working and maintaining its lines of telegraph and telephone and lines for the conveyance of electric power upon, along, across, over and under the same; and may erect, equip and maintain such and so many poles or other works and devices as the company deems necessary for making, completing and supporting, using, working and maintaining the system of communication by telegraph and telephone and for supplying power; and may stretch wires and other electrical contrivances, thereon; and, as often as the company, its agents, officers or workmen think proper, may break up and open any part whatsoever of the said public roads, highways, streets, bridges, watercourses, navigable and non-navigable waters and other like places subject, however, to the following provisions, that is to say:\n(a) The company shall not, in the construction or operation of its lines, interfere with the public right of travelling on or using such public roads, highways, streets, bridges or watercourses, and other like places, and shall Dot do any unnecessary damage, nor in any way obstruct the entrance to any door or gateway or free access to any building erected in the vicinity;\n(b) The company shall not affix any telegraph or telephone wires less than 22 feet above the surface of the street or road, nor erect, without the consent of the municipal council having jurisdiction over the roads or streets of the municipality, more than one line of poles along any street or road;\n(c) In all municipalities the poles shall be as nearly as possible straight and perpendicular, and shall, in cities, be painted, if so required by any by-law of the council;\n(d) Whenever, in case of fire, it becomes necessary for its extinction or for the preservation of property, that the poles or wires should be cut, the cutting under such circumstances of the poles or any of the wires of the company, under the direction of the chief engineer or other officer in charge of the fire brigade, shall not entitle the company to demand or to claim compensation for any damage thereby incurred;\n(e) The company shall be responsible for all damage which its agents, servants or workmen cause to individuals or property in carrying out or maintaining any of its said works; (f) The company shall not cut down or mutilate any shade, fruit or ornamental tree;\n(g) In all municipalities the opening up of streets for the erection of poles, or for carrying the wires underground, shall be subject to the supervision of such engineer or other person as the council appoints for that purpose, and shall be done in such manner as the council directs: the council may also direct and designate the places where the poles are to be erected in such municipality; and the surface of the streets shall in all cases be restored as far as possible to its former condition by and at the expense of the company.\n(h) No Act of Parliament requiring the company in case efficient means are devised for carrying telegraph or telephone wires under ground, to adopt such means, and abrogating the right given by this section to continue carrying lines on poles through cities, towns or incorporated villages, shall be deemed an infringement of the privileges granted by this Act, and the company shall not be entitled to damages therefor;\n(i) No person shall labour upon the work of erecting or repairing any line or instrument of the company, without having conspicuously attached to his dress a medal or badge on which shall be legibly inscribed the name of the company and a number by which he can be readily identified;\n(j) Nothing in this Act contained shall be deemed to authorize the company, its servants, workmen or agents, to enter upon any private property for the purpose of erecting, maintaining or repairing any of its wires without the previous assent of the owner or occupant of the property for the time being;\n(k) If in the removal of buildings or in the exercise of the public right of travelling on, or using any public road, highway or street, it becomes necessary that the said wires be temporarily removed by cutting or otherwise, it shall be the duty of the company at its own expense, upon reasonable notice in writing, from any person requiring the same, to remove such wires or poles, and in default of the company so doing it shall be lawful for any such person to remove the same at the expense of the company, doing no unnecessary damage thereby; and such notice may be given either at the office of the company or to any agent or officer of the company in the municipality wherein such wires or poles are required to be removed, or in the case of a municipality wherein there is no such agent or officer of the company, then either at the head office or to any agent or officer of the company in the nearest or any adjoining municipality to that in which such wires or poles require to be removed.\nThe French version of sub-section (e), to which it may be convenient to refer, is as follows:\u2014\n\"La compagnie sera responsable de tous dommages que ses agents, employes et ouvriers causeront aux particuliers ou aux propri\u00e9t\u00e9s en executant ou eniretenant quelqu'un de ses dits ouvrages.\" This provision has not in my judgment the effect contended for; Lord Halsbury's language in Shelfer v. City of London Electric Lighting Co.[7], at page 310, is applicable.\nWhen one considers how frequently the distinction between the execution of the works and the use of them when executed had been the subject of comment and discussion, I think it must be taken that the language used has been deliberately chosen by the legislature as pointing to a distinction, now well recognized, between the construction of works and the user of them when constructed.\nA reference to other provisions of the Act shows that this distinction was not overlooked. See section 76, section 8, section 9a and b, section 10, and subsections 2 and 3, section 12 and sub-section 2, the whole of the substantive part of section 13 and subsec. a.\nThese provisions also suggest that the distinction between the user and maintenance was not unobserved. It may be noticed also that the collocation of words in sub-sec. e \"damage caused by the agent's servants or workmen of the company\" when read with subsection (j) would indicate that the section contemplates such operations only as those specifically authorized in the substantive part of section 13,\nentry upon any public road, highway, street, bridge, watercourse, navigable or non-navigable water or other such places * * * * erecting, equipping and maintaining.\nof poles and other works and devices; the stretching wires and other electrical contrivances thereon; breaking up, opening public highways, watercourses and other like places; and not to the acts of the \"agents, servants or workmen\" of the company in the working of its railway, for example, in the running of its cars.\nThe provision, of course, ought to be read with section 92 of the Dominion \"Railway Act\" then in force (51 Vict. ch. 29). Section 92 has always been held in itself to give only a right to compensation under the special provisions of the \"Railway Act\" for lands taken or injuriously affected and this right has always been held to be available in those cases only in which lands are taken for the exercise of some legal right annexed to the ownership of the land, the right of access, for example, which is or is to be directly prejudiced by the construction or the operation of the railway. It is sufficiently obvious that section 13e may be given a considerable scope outside of the operation of section 92 of the \"Railway Act\" without adopting the sweeping construction advanced on behalf of the appellants.\nI think the language of the section cannot properly be held to extend to damages resulting from the non-negligent exercise of powers declared by the statute to be lawfully exercisable in the working of the company's undertaking (as distinguished from the construction or maintenance of its works), as, for example, the running of its cars in the streets of Quebec and in the working of its electric light plant.\nDecisions upon one statute ought, of course, to be applied very cautiously in the construction of another statute, but I think it right to say that when one considers the manner in which sections 92 and 288 of the \"Railway Act\" in force in 1895 and 1899 were construed and applied in Canadian Pacific Railway Co, v. Roy[8] (see particularly page 231), and the manner in which the provisions of the Quebec statute 1 Edw. VII., chap. 66, and especially the provisions of section 10 (only quoted in part in the judgment), were applied in Dumphy v. Montreal Light, Heat and Power Co.[9], one is not disposed to charge oneself with rashness in rejecting the construction proposed by the appellants.\nSome of my learned brethren think that the plaintiffs are entitled to recover under a provision found in the last sentence of section two of chapter 71, 44 & 45 Vict. (Que.) incorporating the Electric Light Company of Quebec and Levis, which apparently became the Montmorency Power Co., the words relied upon being:\u2014\nLa compagnie sera responsable de tous les dommages qu'elle pourra causer dans l'execution de ses travaux.\nI observe, in passing, that there is sufficient evidence in the language of the Act, section 6 for example, to show that \"travaux\" is used in the sense of, to quote Lord Atkinson's expression in The City of Montreal v. The Montreal Street Railway Co.[10] of \"physical things not services\" and any contention founded upon this provision is properly subject to the observation made above as to the distinction between the \"execution\" of works and the use or operation of such works when executed, a distinction which was plainly not overlooked by the authors of this statute.\nBut the fatal objection against resorting to this provision as ground of relief is that there is nothing before us entitling us to hold that the damage complained of in this case was the result of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by the statute in which it is contained. Section 2 of the Act of 1899, quoted above, gives ample authority for the establishment and operation of a system of electric lighting for the City and District of Quebec, and I do not know on what ground this court could judicially say, the matter not having been touched in the evidence and no point having been made of it by the parties, that the works in question here were constructed or are operated under the provisions of the Quebec Act. Section 15 of the Act of 1895 authorized the purchase of the \"works, buildings and machinery\" of the Montmorency Electric Power Co. There is nothing in section 2 of the Act of 1895 which imports the provision relied upon as a qualification of the powers thereby given. The Dominion Parliament, of course, did not assume in section 3 to legislate with regard to the works of the Montmorency Electric Power Co. as an undertaking established and carried on under the authority of the Legislature of Quebec. It necessarily (otherwise there would be no jurisdiction) treated these works as part of the undertaking of the Dominion company whose undertaking had been, by the statute of 1895, declared to be a work for the general advantage of Canada. The \"franchise powers and privileges\" referred to in section 3 as those enjoyed by the Montmorency Electric Power Co. \"in virtue of its charter\" which it is declared the Dominion company \"may in future exercise and enjoy\" must be read as \"franchise powers and privileges\" granted by the Dominion Parliament. I think it is questionable whether one is entitled to treat that as importing a provision of the local Act relating o the responsibility of the Montmorency Electric Power Co. in view of the fact that the works authorized by the local Act are being brought into and made part of a larger undertaking under the control of the Dominion and governed by different statutory provisions. At all events until adequate grounds are shewn against it the respondent company is entitled to justify under the general provisions of the Acts of 1895 and 1899 including section 2 of the Act of 1899. There are other difficulties in the appellants' way on this branch of his appeal. First,\u2014Does a provision of this kind, construed as relating to the operations of the companies' undertaking, govern the legal relation between the company and its customers to whom it supplies electric light or power? The appellants must maintain the affirmative. The language is not apt for the purpose of making the company insurer of its customers against accidents in operation not attributable to negligence. But I pass that. It is quite too late now, in the state of the record, in view of the considerations above mentioned to base any relief upon this statutory provision which was not relied upon at the trial or mentioned in the pleadings.\nSecondly. Assuming the appellants to be right in their construction of the provisions \"I have been discussing and assuming the second of the provisions to be applicable, there is still, I think, an insuperable difficulty in the way of giving effect to the appellants' claim to relief in so far as it rests upon these provisions if the finding of the court of appeal be accepted, and I think it ought to be accepted, that the diversion of the electric current from the primary to the secondary wire was the result of vis major. Accepting that finding it results, I think, that on no admissible construction of these provisions can the company or the agents, servants and workmen of the company he held to have \"caused\" the damage for which reparation is claimed.\nLord Moulton in delivering the judgment of the Privy Council in Richards v. Lothian[11], at page 278 said:\u2014 Their Lordships are of the opinion that all that there is laid down as to a case where the escape is due to \"vis major or the King's enemies\" applies equally to a case where it is due to the malicious act of a third person, if indeed that case is not actually included in the above phrase. To follow the language of the judgment just recited\u2014a defendant cannot, in their Lordship's opinion, be properly said to have caused or allowed the water to escape if the malicious act of a third person was the real cause of its escaping without any fault on the part of the defendant.\nA passage in the judgment of Lord Sumner in Charing Cross Euston and Hampstead Rway. Co. v. Boots[12], was relied on in the argument as authority for the proposition that the \"cause\" in the juridical sense was the generation of electricity and the transmission of it through the company's wires, which was the work of the company's agents, employees and workmen; but the passage in question has obviously no reference to a case where vis major or the independent volition of a third person has intervened. An authority perhaps more directly in point is the judgment of the Privy Council delivered by Lord Robertson in Dumphy's Case[13]. The injury complained of was the result of a derrick used by a building contractor being brought into contact with the overhead wires of the Montreal Street Railway Company, the current of electricity thereby diverted having killed the plaintiff's husband. Speaking for their Lordships, Lord Robertson says:\non the face of the case it is manifest that the causa causans of the casualty was the act of the person using the derrick.\nThe generation of the electricity by the respondent company which would have been harmless but for the interposition of a novus actus interveniens (vis major) ought not any more than the storing of water to be regarded as the cause of the resulting harm for the purpose of assigning responsibility.\nA little consideration makes it plain that no distinction can for this purpose be drawn between the case of water stored for the storer's purposes and electricity generated for his purposes. If a mischievous person opens the outlet of a storage basin, or the confining barrier is destroyed or rendered useless by some accident of nature not foreseeable amounting to vis major, the storer is not responsible for the ensuing damage because, as Lord Moulton says, he has neither caused the water to escape nor allowed the water to escape although it was he who constructed the storage basin and collected there water which on escaping was certain to become a destructive agency. So if he constructs a flume to carry water from his dam to his power-house and somebody breaks down his flume at a place where the water, under a high head, escaping becomes an instrument of harm, or if this happens through some operation of nature which he could not be expected to foresee or to provide against he is not responsible in absence of negligence because he has neither caused nor allowed the water, to escape; so also the energy of the water flowing through his conduits operating on the machinery of his power-house having become converted into electric energy which solely by reason of the mischievous interference of a third person, or of the operation of vis major, escapes control, this is a result which, for juridical purposes, cannot in general be properly ascribed to the measures he has taken for the purpose of and resulting in the conversion of mechanical energy into electrical energy but must be ascribed to the agency to which its escape is immediately due.\nStrictly, of course, what I have said upon this point postulates a correspondence of meaning between \"cause\" as used in the provisions under consideration and \"cause\" as used by Lord Moulton in the passage quoted above. I think this is a legitimate reading; any broader reading of the word \"cause\" would, on the proposed construction subject the company affected by these provisions to a stricter responsiblity than that which would arise from the unfettered operation of the doctrine of Rylands v. Fletcher[14].\nIn the result the rule governing the responsibility of the defendant company in respect of the operation of its electric lighting system, apart from special provisions in its statutes, which have no application here, is that, generally speaking, they are responsible for harm caused by negligence and not otherwise\u2014the rule applied in Dumphy's Case[15] and Roy's Case[16].\nBut the important question arises:\u2014Is the status of the appellants vis-\u00e0-vis the respondent company either as regards the rules governing the burden of proof, or as regards the rules governing their substantive rights, affected by the circumstance that they were customers of the respondent company; and that the injury in respect of which reparation is claimed was an injury that would not have occurred but for the connection, at their instance or by their consent, between their houses and the respondent company's system by service wires put in place for their accommodation? Dealing with the question, apart from articles 1053, 1054, 1055 C.C., I should have no difficulty in holding that the company's duty arising out of the situation, except in so far as it is modified by contract, is a duty to take proper care to protect the appellants and their property, and proper care involves, where the consequences of neglect may in the ordinary course be expected to be very serious, the use of a high degree of knowledge, skill and diligence. That is the view which has been taken in a number of cases in Canada and the United States in which the question has come up, Royal Electric Co, v. H\u00e9v\u00e9[17]; Joyce, \"Electric Law,\" paragraph 445 d and e; and I think it is conformable to the legal principle according to which persons undertaking to perform services for others involving risk of harm from want of skill and from accidents beyond prevention by the highest skill are held generally not to be insurers but to warrant the execution of the undertaking with knowledge, skill and diligence commensurate with the gravity of the risk. The doctrine of Rylands v. Fletcher[18] is inapplicable because, apart from the effect of the statute, the risk arising from the connection between the customer's premises and the lighting company's system is a risk due to a situation created with the consent and for the benefit of the customer as well as of the company, and that risk, so long as it is not augmented by the company's negligence, is a risk which he assumes just as a passenger on a street-car assumes the risk of accident not avoidable by the exercise of proper care by the carrier. A risk arising from a situation created by common consent for the common benefit is not within the contemplation of. Rylands v. Fletcher18; Carstairs v. Taylor[19], Blake v. Woolf[20].\nBut the learned judges in both courts below have taken the view, and I understand the majority of the members of this court also take the view, that the effect of articles 1053, 1054, 1055 C.C., is to create a presumption of fault which is a presumption of law capable of being repelled by the respondent company only by establishing that the fire in question was not due to any want of care on its part, the effect of these articles being, according to this view, that once it is shewn that the fire is the result of the escape of electricity from the respondent company's system the burden of establishing that the escape was not due to negligence on his part is cast by law upon the company.\nAlthough such cannot, in view of the decisions I have mentioned, be held to be the operation of article 1054 C.C. as between a member of the public having no special relation with the company carrying on a statutory undertaking, e. g. a way-farer struck by a street-car, I am not aware of any decision that excludes the application of article 1054 C.C., according to whatever be the proper construction of it, for determining the reciprocal obligations and rights of the company and persons taking advantage of its services, although it would appear strange to find a rule of law putting upon a railway company the burden of proof in the issue of negligence or no negligence between it and a passenger and leaving the incidence of the burden upon a farmer whose crop is destroyed by fire resulting from the escape of sparks from an engine. I shall point out what seems to me to be a conclusive reason against the application of articles 1053, 1054, 1055 C.C. according to the appellants' construction of them to this case; but first I shall briefly discuss the appellants' contention as to the effect of them. Before going into articles 1053, 1054, 1055, C.C. it is perhaps desirable to point out in a word or two the difference in practical effect between the view, which I think is the right view, as touching the onus of proof resting on the appellants and the view in relation to the subject which has prevailed with the majority of the judges who have been called upon to pass upon the appellants' claims. The appellants' claims being, I repeat, according to my view, necessarily based upon an allegation that they were injured by the respondent company's negligence in respect of the custody of the electricity in their system, the burden of the affirmative of that issue is a burden which remains upon the appellants to the end; the question put to itself by the tribunal of fact at the conclusion of the whole case is,\u2014taking all the evidence together\u2014have the appellants established by an adequate preponderance in the weight of evidence the affirmative of the issue negligence or no negligence? The situation is well explained in the judgment of Brett, M. R. in Abrath v. North Eastern Rly. Co.[21]. The subject of the burden of proof in this aspect of it is discussed in the treatise on \"Evidence\" in Halsbury's Laws of England, vol. 13, pp. 433 to 436, and, in a very illuminating way, in ch. 9 of Thayer's Preliminary. Treatise on the Law of Evidence.\nThis is not to say, however, that the burden of proof, in another sense, did not shift from the appellants to the respondent company during the course of the trial. The moment the appellants established a prim\u00e2 facie case the burden of proof was cast upon the respondent company in the sense that if no further evidence were given there would have been judgment for the appellants. The prim\u00e2 facie case shifts the burden of proof in this sense although it does not affect the burden of establishing the issue which remains with the appellants to the end.\nThe appellants, as I have said, made out a prim\u00e2 facie case the moment they proved that the fire was due to a current of excessive voltage. So to hold is entirely in conformity with authority and long practice. In Great Western Railway Company v. Braid[22], a passenger injured in a railway accident due to an embankment giving way was held to have made out a prim\u00e2 facie case of negligence on proof of the fact that the embankment had given way; so the fact of the collision of trains constitutes a prim\u00e2 facie case of negligence. The sufficiency of facts proved to constitute a prim\u00e2 facie case is not determined by any rule of law of general application. The doctrine of the prim\u00e2 facie case rests upon this\u2014that the facts proved taken together with the failure on the part of the defendant to give any explanation justifies the inference of negligence. The doctrine of res ipsa loquitur rests upon that.\nBut the appellants having given evidence constituting a prim\u00e2 facie case the respondent company could meet that case by proving facts which, while not establishing the non-existence of negligence, should destroy the preponderance of evidence in favour of the plaintiff. The practical effect as regards this appeal is, as I have already indicated, that the question to be determined is whether or not, on the whole of the evidence, the appellants have shewn that the fire in question was due to the negligence of the respondent company.\nThe other view is this: Article 1054 C.C. declares that where one person suffers harm from something in the care of another the law presumes that the harm is due to the fault of the person having care of the thing which has caused the harm, the practical consequence being, as regards the case before us, that the burden of establishing the negative of the issue negligence or no negligence is cast by law upon the respondent company the moment the origin of the fire is proved; and that at the conclusion of the case the appellants must succeed unless the tribunal is satisfied that the respondent company has established the non-existence of negligence leading to the escape of electricity.\nIn Shawinigan Carbide Co. v. Doucet[23], I have given my reasons in support of the view above indicated as to the construction and effect of articles 1053, 1054, 1055 C.C. which \"is that, except in the particular cases specified in those articles where faute d\u00e9lictuelle is the ground of the action, it must be proved and that the legal presumption of fault for harm caused by \"things under one's care\" arises only in those specific cases.\nThere appears to be very little room for dispute that such was the French common law. Admittedly this view of the effect of articles 1382, 1383, 1384, and 1385, C.N. was accepted without dissent or suggestion of dissent both by la Doctrine and by la Jurisprudence in France down to 1870.\nI quote from an article by M. Saleilles (10 Rev. Trimestrielle p. 38):\nsi l'on se place au point de vue de l'interpr\u00e9tation originaire du droit fran\u00e7ais, il est absolument certain que jusqu'aux approches des ann\u00e9es 1861 et 1866, \u00e9poque de la pr\u00e9paration et de la promulgation du Code Civil canadien, tout le monde admettait en France, sur 1'article 1384, doctrine et jurisprudence, que la responsabilit\u00e9 des accidents de travail \u00e9tait r\u00e9gl\u00e9e exclusivement par l'article 1382. On admettait, \u00e0 tort ou \u00e0 raison, que l\u2019article 1384, en parlant des \"choses que l'on a sous sa garde,\" n'avait fait que poser un principe qui devait trouver son application explicite dans les dispositions subs\u00e9quentes des articles 1385 et 1386. C'\u00e9tait une pierre d'attente. M. Esmein l'a admirablement \u00e9tabli, et M. Planiol aussi. La doctrine de M. Esmein et de M. Planiol, justifi\u00e9e ou non, est celle qui avait cours avant 1870, ce n'est pas douteux. Comment donc le l\u00e9gislateur canadien, qui nous empruntait le texte, \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s int\u00e9gral, de notre article 1384, l'aurait-il entendu autrement qu'on l'entendait en France \u00e0 ses d\u00e9buts? Donc la doctrine et la jurisprudence fran\u00e7aise ne peuvent avoir de valeur pour l'interpretation du texte canadien correspondant \u00e0 notre article 1384, que s'il s'agit de celles qui avaient cours avant 1870.\nI also quote from MM. Colin et Capitant (Cours El\u00e9mentaire de Droit Civil Fran\u00e7ais, Vol. 2, p. 390) :\u2014\nSupposons un dommage caus\u00e9 par une chose autre qu'un animal ou un b\u00e2timent, par exemple, par un terrain non construit (effondrement d'une marni\u00e8re, \u00e9boulement, etc.), ou par un objet mobilier (explosion de machine, chute d'un pot de fleurs, etc.). Par quelle r\u00e9gie va \u00eatre gouvern\u00e9e la responsabilit\u00e9 du propri\u00e9taire de ces objets?\nPendant longtemps, la jurisprudence et la doctrine se sont accord\u00e9es pour d\u00e9clarer qu'il y avait lieu ici \u00e0 application pure et simple des principes du droit commun. Le propri\u00e9taire n'\u00e9tait donc passible de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats, que si l'on pouvait faire la d\u00e9monstration d'une faute qu'il eut commise aux termes des articles 1382 et 1383 (Civ., 19 juillet 1870, D.P. 70, 1. 361, S. 71. 1. 9). Cette solution, avec la diff\u00e9rence qui en r\u00e9sultait entre les cons\u00e9quences de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 d'un animal ou d'un b\u00e2timent d'une part, et, d'autre part, celle de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 d'une chose inanim\u00e9e en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, paraissait d'ailleurs \u00e9quitable. Et en effet, si l'on comprend l'\u00e9tablissement d'une pr\u00e9somption de faute pour les animaux, lesquels exigent une surveillance constante, ou pour les b\u00e2timents, dont la ruine possible est particuli\u00e8rement dangereuse et exige d'attentives mesures de prudence, il n'y a pas de raison de se montrer aussi s\u00e9v\u00e8re pour le propri\u00e9taire d'objets inanim\u00e9s. Par lui-m\u00eame, l'objet inanim\u00e9 n'est pas susceptible de causer un dommage; il faut supposer, pour que le fait se produise, une faute de la victime, un d\u00e9faut d'entretien du propri\u00e9taire, ou enfin un de ces cas fortuits qui d\u00e9fient la prudence humaine. D\u00e8s lors, il serait peu \u00e9quitable d'attribuer \u00e0 priori \u00e0 la faute du propri\u00e9taire des accidents dont la plupart auront une autre cause.\nLes choses \u00e9taient \u00e0 ce point, lorsque se produisit le mouvement doctrinal, dont nous avons parl\u00e9, en faveur d'une responsabilit\u00e9 purement objective. C'est surtout sur le terrain des dommages caus\u00e9s par le fait des choses inanim\u00e9s, en particulier de l'outillage industriel (et si l'on comprend l'acuit\u00e9 du probl\u00e8me \u00e0 une \u00e9poque o\u00f9 aucune l\u00e9gislation sp\u00e9ciale n'existait en mati\u00e8re d'accidents du travail), que se porta l'effort de la doctrine nouvelle.\nIt was not until 1908 that the Cour de Cassation departed from the traditional French view. In this country the Quebec court of appeal (Taschereau, C. J., Boss\u00e9, Trenholme, Lavergne, Cross, JJ.) in Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Dionne[24], decided in 1908, expressly and formally declared as follows:\u2014 The fact of the injury alleged having been caused by a thing under the control of the defendant, has not in law of itself the effect of placing upon the defendant the burden of proving that the injury was caused without fault on the part of the defendant or his servants.\nA declaration in harmony with decisions of the same court pronounced in great numbers during the preceding 40 years.\nAnd in the Supreme Court of Canada, in 1906, in Paquet v. Dufour[25], Mr. Justice Girourard referred to the course of the decisions in this court in the following language:\u2014.\nBefore closing, I wish (says the learned judge), to point out a consid\u00e9rant of the trial judge to which I cannot subscribe:\n\"Consid\u00e9rant que la dite explosion ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9e par de la dynamit\u00e9 dont le d\u00e9fendeur \u00e9tait le propri\u00e9taire et dont il avait la garde, il doit \u00eatr tenu responsable des dommages qui en sont r\u00e9sult\u00e9s pour le demandeur, \u00e0 moins qu'il n'ait preuv\u00e9 qu'il lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 impossible de l'\u00e9viter.\"\nWe have so often decided in our court that proof of fault, whether by direct evidence or by presumption, rests upon the plaintiff, that it is not necessary to quote authorities.\nWithout entering upon an analysis of the language of the articles 1053, 1054, 1055 C.C. for which I may refer to my judgment in Shawinigan Carbide Co. v. Doucet[26], I quote two paragraphs from that judgment touching the effect of the legislation by which the Civil Code was formally declared to be law in the Province of Quebec.\nA far stronger reason against excluding the pre-existing law from consideration is afforded by the terms of the enactments under the authority of which the Code came into force as law which evince very plainly the intention to declare, in articles 1053, 1054, 1055 the law as it then stood. There was first an Act of the Province of Canada (20 Vict. ch. 43) authorizing the appointment of Commissioners and directing that they should embody in the Code to be framed by them, to be called the Civil Code of Lower Canada, such provisions as they should hold to be then actually in force, giving the authorities on which their views should be based, but stating separately any proposed amendment. Then (the commissioners having in due course framed their report and laid it before Parliament), there was another Act (29 Vict. ch. 41) declaring a certain roll attested in the manner described in the Act to be the original of the Civil Code reported by the Commissioner as containing the existing law without amendments; directing the Commissioners to incorporate in this roll certain specified amendments eliminating and altering the provisions of it only so far as should be necessary to give effect to these amendments; and providing that the Code so altered, should, on proclamation by the Governor, have the force of law.\nIt hardly seems necessary to comment on the effect of this legislation. It very manifestly exhibits the intention of the legislature that the provisions found in the roll referred to were not, excepting in so far as they should be affected by the amendments specified, to effect any substantial alteration in the law then actually in force in Lower Canada. Among the provisions contained in this roll (and untouched by the amendments sanctioned), are articles 1053, 1054, 1055 C. C; and in construing them we have therefore this clear and important guide to the intention of the legislature.\nThe view of the effect of article 1054 C.C. which appears to have been taken by the majority of the court below, namely, that it creates a presumption of law that harm arising from things under one's care, whether in their nature dangerous or not, is due to one's fault, which presumption can be repelled by proper and sufficient general evidence of the absence of fault. This view has not been accepted in France either in la doctrine or in la jurisprudence. A very lucid and concise account of the present state of la doctrine and la jurisprudence on this subject is given by MM. Colon et Capitant at pp. 390-391, vol. 2, of the work already referred to.\nIn la doctrine the weightiest authorities favour the theory known as faute objective or risque professionel of which the late M. Saleilles was the most eminent protagonist, the doctrine, in a word, that the incidence of responsibility in law depends upon the incidence of risk and that one ought to bear the risk of harm from things one exploits for one's own benefit. In exploiting for one's benefit choses inanim\u00e9es one acts at one's peril. The course of la jurisprudence may be described in the language of MM. Colon et Capitant as follows:\nOn a pu croire un moment que la jurisprudence allait suivre les novateurs dans la voie qu'ils frayaient. Un arr\u00eat de la Chambre civile du 16 juin 1896 (D. P. 97. 1. 433, S. 97. 1. 17) semblait en effet s'y engager, car il affirmait la responsabilit\u00e9 du propri\u00e9taire d'une machine, (d'un remarqueur), qui avait fait explosion, bien que cette explosion fut due \u00e0 un vice de construction auquel il \u00e9tait \u00e9tranger; et apr\u00e8s cette d\u00e9cision autour de laquelle on mena grand bruit, on en rencontre quelques autres encore se rattachant par leurs motifs \u00e0 la th\u00e9orie du risque cr\u00e9e (Trib. Seine, 23 janvier 1903, D. P. 1904, 2. 257; Lyon, 18 janvier, 1907, D. P. 1909, 2, 245; Trib. com. Seine, 23 d\u00e9cembre 1911, Gax. Pal. 19 janvier 1912). L'une de ces d\u00e9cisions n'avait-elle pas condamn\u00e9 le propri\u00e9taire d'un caf\u00e9 \u00e0 indemniser un consommateur par c\u00e9 seul motif que le demandeur avait \u00e9t\u00e9 bless\u00e9 par l'\u00e9clatement d'un siphon?\nMais ce courant peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 aujourd-hui comme d\u00e9finitivement tari. La Cour de Cassation a, par plusieurs arr\u00eats, condamn\u00e9 le nouveau syst\u00e8me d'interpr\u00e9tation (Req. 30 mars 1897, D. P. 97. 1. 433, S. 98. 1. 65; Civ. 31 juillet 1905, D. P. 1905. 1. 532, S. 1909. 1. 143).\nNeanmoins, si la jurisprudence a refus\u00e9 de suivre les novateurs dans l'interpr\u00e9tation audacieuse qu'ils proposaient, elle n'en a pas moins subi leur influence. En effet, elle admettait autrefois, nous l'avons vu, que la victime d'un accident caus\u00e9 par un objet inanim\u00e9 devait prouver la faute commise par le propri\u00e9taire de cet objet, ou par celui qui s'en servait. Aujourd'hui, au contraire, elle consid\u00e8re que l'article 1384, al. 1, cr\u00e9e une pr\u00e9somption de faute \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de ce propri\u00e9taire, et, en cons\u00e9quence, elle fait peser sur lui la charge de la preuve.\nLa jurisprudence, toujours sous la m\u00eame influence se montre plus s\u00e9v\u00e8re; elle applique ici la m\u00eame solution qu'au propri\u00e9taire ou gardien d'animaux. Il ne suffira donc pas au d\u00e9fendeur d'\u00e9tablir qu'il n'a commis ni n\u00e9gligence ni imprudence; il devra prouver que le dommage provient soit de cas fortuit, soit de la force majeure, soit de toute autre cause \u00e9trang\u00e8re, par exemple de la faute de la victime ou de celle d'un tiers, en un mot il faudra qu'il pr\u00e9cise le fait g\u00e9n\u00e9rateur du dommage subi par son adversaire (Req. 22 janvier, 1908, D. P. 1908, 1. 217; 25 mars 1908, D. P. 1909. 1. 73, S. 1910, 1.17; Bordeaux, 14 mars, 1911, S. 1913, 2. 257; Pau, 13 janvier, 1913, Gaz. Pal. 2 avril, 1913; Paris, 4 d\u00e9cembre, 1912, D. P. 1913, 2, 80, S, 1913, 2. 164 et Req., 19 janvier, 1914. Gaz Pal. 7 fevrier, 1914.) V. cependent Req. 29 avril 1913, D. P. 1913. 1. 427, exemptant le propri\u00e9taire d'un chaine ayant occasionn\u00e9 un accident par sa rupture, motif pris de ce qu'on n'a pu relever aucun vice de construction et \"qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 impossible de d\u00e9terminer la cause d'un \u00e9v\u00e8nement qu'il ne d\u00e9pendait de lui ni de pr\u00e9voir ni d'\u00e9viter.) From the point of view of verbal interpretation simply there is probably more to be said in favour of these views which have found acceptance in France than can be said for the view adopted by the Quebec Court of Appeal.\nI have pointed out in the Shawinigan Carbide Co. v. Doucet[27], at pages 317 to 320, the impossibility of reading paragraph 6 of article 1054 C.C. as applying to the first paragraph of the article as well as to the particular case mentioned in paragraphs two to five. The English version is conclusively against this application of paragraph six and article 2615 C.C. requires us, where the two differ, to resort to that version which is the more conformable to le droit commun. The French theories above referred to both rest upon the hypothesis that the first paragraph of 1384 C.N., while not in itself establishing a principle of responsibility, indicates a principle of responsibility underlying the precise dispositions of articles 1385 and 1386 C.N.; and that, although the framers of the Code Napoleon had no thought of any such principle, it is the legitimate function of the courts to extend by analogy the supposed principle of those dispositions (harmoniously with the ensemble of the law in force for the time being) to new conditions as they arise. M. Saleilles in the article to which I have just referred (p. 42) uses these words:\u2014\nEn r\u00e9alit\u00e9, les avocats et les juges n'avaient pas donn\u00e9 de la loi une interpr\u00e9tation inexacte, en l'interpr\u00e9tant jadis autrement qu'on ne l'interpr\u00e9te aujourd'hui. Ils lui attribuaient alors, et avec raison, le sens qui ressortait des principes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux admis autrefois par l'ensemble de la l\u00e9gislation. Ces principes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux se sont modifi\u00e9s aujourd'hui; et, en se modifiant, ils ont influ\u00e9 sur le sens qu'il faut attribuer actuellement aux textes rest\u00e9s sous la d\u00e9pendance directe de ces m\u00eames principes juridiques. C'est le sens intime de la loi qui a vari\u00e9, ce ne sont pas les juges.\nAnd he adds that it is the duty of the courts to act upon their view of what the legislator would have enacted if he had envisaged the conditions of to-day. If this were a legitimate procedure much might be said for the conclusion of M. Saleilles, and much for the theory of la jurisprudence in France and much also it may be added for the view of the court of appeal; in truth the want of unanimity as to result (there are other theories current in France), is but the natural consequence of following a procedure which, under the name of judicial interpretation, in reality amounts to explicit judicial amendment of the law. I use this phrase because the process described by M. Saleilles is what we should unquestionably call legislation and there can be no doubt that the abrupt reversal by the Quebec court of appeal in Doucet v. Shawinigan Carbide Co.[28], of the principle of its previous judgment in Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Dionne[29], pronounced only a very short time before, was the direct result of French influence. I cannot understand on what principle (compatible with proper respect to judicial precedent), this court can now sanction an interpretation of article 1054 C.C. which it has again and again rejected. See Shawinigan Carbide Co. v. Doucet[30], pp. 309 and 310.\nThere is, moreover, I think, this complete answer to any claim under article 1054 C.C. Assuming the first paragraph of article 1054 C.C., when read with article 1055, to justify the extension of the dispositions of article 1055 to analogous cases, it is quite clear that there is no analogy between the specific cases therein provided for and the case where as here the risk, incidence of which the plaintiff seeks to make the defendant discharge, arises out of a situation created by the common consent and for the common benefit.\nAs to the questions of fact, I think the judgments of the learned Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Pelletier shew satisfactorily that the appellants have failed to make out that the fires are ascribable to the negligence of the respondent company. I will add that I do not differ from the finding that the circumstances in which the high-voltage current escaped to the secondary wire constitute a case of vis major.\nAnglin J.\u2014The question for determination in these cases is the liability of the defendant company for damages occasioned by fires caused by a high-tension electric current (approximately 2,200 volts), carried on its primary wires, having passed from them to its secondary or low-voltage wires and thence into buildings of its customers fitted with a system of wiring designed to carry a current not exceeding 108 to 110 volts. It appears to be so well established that it is practically common ground that the immediate cause of connection having been established between the primary and secondary wires was the falling across them of a large branch from a near-by tree, which stood on the adjacent property of one of the defendants' customers.\nIn this court the plaintiffs rested their claims upon four distinct grounds:\u2014\n1st. That by the statute (58 & 59 Vict. (D.) ch. 59, sec. 13) under which they were operating, the defendant company is declared to be responsible for all damages which its agents, servants, or workmen cause to individuals or property in carrying out or maintaining any of its said works.\nIts original Act of Incorporation (44 & 45 Vict. (Q.), ch. 71, sec. 2), provides that the company\nshall be responsible for all damages which it may cause in carrying out its works;\nand the works authorized by the section in which this provision is made are, inter alia,\nto manufacture, furnish, produce, use and sell or lease light, heat and motive power in the city and district of Quebec generated from electricity and to establish, construct, &c., lines of wires, &c.\nUnder this legislation, it is asserted that the company is liable for damage caused by the electric current which it transmits upon its wires, without regard to any consideration of fault or negligence on its part.\n2nd. That without proof of fault or negligence, absolute liability of the company is established under article 1054 C.C. upon its being shewn that the damage sued for was caused by a thing which it had under its care.\n3rd. That liability under article 1054 C.C. exists at all events, because the company failed to prove that it \"was unable to prevent the act which caused the damage;\"\n4th. That proof has been given of specific negligence or fault on the part of the company (a) in not having taken adequate precautions to guard against the fall of the branch which fell across and broke its wires, (b) in not having had its transformers grounded.\nI make no allusion to other grounds of fault which were urged, either because they were not alleged in the particulars furnished, or because they were so clearly disproved that they are not open for consideration in this court. It was so obviously unnecessary to provide expressly for liability of the company in case of fault or negligence that the explicit declarations of responsibility above quoted can scarcely have been inserted to cover that ground. There is nothing in the language of the clause in either statute which requires that it should be so restricted in its application, and it is\na settled canon of construction that a statute ought to be so construed that, if it can be prevented, no clause, sentence or word shall be superfluous, void or insignificant. The Queen v. Bishop of Oxford (4 Q.B.D. 245, 271); Ditcher v. Dennison (11 Moo. P.C. 325, 337).\nIt would, therefore, seem proper to regard these clauses as intended to declare that, in empowering the company to do what would otherwise be unlawful, both the Legislature and Parliament meant to subject it to liability for injuries which might arise from the carrying out of its undertaking in cases in which the legislative authorization of such undertaking would, but for such provisions, entitled it to claim immunity. Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Roy[31], Eastern and South African Telegraph Co. v. Cape Town Tramways Co.[32]. With similar clauses in legislation conferring special privileges we are not unfamiliar. Gale v. Bureau[33]; Dumont v. Fraser[34]. In conferring such privileges in the present instance the legislature apparently thought it reasonable to provide that its sanction should not be invoked as a shield against responsibility for any injuries to others which the exercise of those privileges might entail.\nThe injuries sued for were caused in carrying out or maintaining \"the works,\" i.e., the undertaking of the company. This seems to be clear from the terms of the original Quebec statute, wherein the furnishing of electric current for lighting purposes by means of wires is part of the works authorized by the very section in which the declaration of liability is found. Although the fall of a branch from a tree was, in a certain sense, the cause of the fires, it in reality but created the situation in which the transmission of a high-voltage current by the company, acting through its servants or workmen, along its wires in the course of carrying out its undertaking caused the damage complained of. I have found no reason for confining the effect of the clauses in question to injuries done in the course of constructing or repairing the company's lines or installation. The phrase, \"carrying on and maintaining its works,\" or \"carrying out its works,\" in these statutory provisions, in my opinion, covers operation as well as construction. In this respect the statute differs from 1 Edw. VII., ch. 66, under which the works had been constructed in Dumphy's Case[35], and a provision somewhat similar to that above quoted from 44 & 45 Vict. (Que.) ch. 71 does not appear to have been there relied upon.\nNeither can I, without frittering away these legislative declarations of responsibility, regard this case as outside their purview merely because the fall of a branch from a tree was the immediate occasion of the existing danger created by the defendant company producing actual injury. On the first ground, therefore, I think the defendant liable.\nI assume, that in so far as these actions are brought under article 1053 C.C., it has been rightly held that the burden of proving fault or negligence of the defendants, which rested on the plaintiffs, has not been satisfactorily discharged. They certainly failed to shew that the defendants' high-tension wires were in too close proximity to its low-tension wires, or that the distance between pins on cross-arms was not sufficiently great, and there was no evidence that these defects, if they existed, had anything to do with the cause of the fires. I am not prepared to say that the Court of King's Bench erred in holding that the plaintiffs had failed to prove actual requirements of the Canadian Fire Underwriters' Association or orders issued by the Public Utilities Commission with which the defendants had not complied, or, upon the evidence as to the safety or advisability of grounding transformers to reverse the finding of the appellate court that it was not affirmatively established that, having regard to the condition of the wiring of the houses in the neighbourhood, it was actionable fault or negligence on the part of the company not to have had its transformers grounded, or that it was negligent in not having foreseen that there was reason to apprehend that the branch which fell across its wires would do so.\nThe matter last mentioned, though not included in the particulars furnished was fully gone into at the trial. Whether the branch which fell actually overhung (surplombait) the defendant company's wires is a point in dispute. The trial judge apparently thought it did\u2014the appellate judges, that it did not; and the evidence seems to support the latter view. But it appears that branches at a lower level undoubtedly did overhang the wires and it would seem reasonably certain that, when the large branch, which fell, was broken off by the weight of the ice upon it, probably aided by the action of the wind, in falling, again aided in all probability by the high wind, it glided or slid on the icy surface of these lower overhanging branches out from the tree towards the defendant's wires and was thus brought over and allowed to fall upon the two outer wires which it broke, the inner wire\u2014that nearest the tree\u2014remaining intact. Whether this occurrence was something which should have been anticipated and guarded against or ought to be regarded as a case of unforeseeable accident, or an \"act of God,\" or the result of vis major, against which there is no obligation to provide, is in issue. That the storm, with its accompaniments of sleet and heavy ice formations on trees and wires and high wind, was not in itself so extraordinary that it should be regarded as unforeseeable, or as constituting force majeure, so that its ordinary or not improbable consequences would be something which persons in the position of the defendants would not be bound to anticipate and guard against is, I think, quite clear. But whether, having regard to its situation and the surrounding circum stances, the fall of the branch in question across the company's wires should be deemed such a consequence is a debatable point.\nAs to the other defects in installation suggested at the trial, as Mr. Justice Pelletier points out, the existence of some of them was not shewn, and the causal relation of others, assuming their existence, was not established. Indeed some of these grounds of negligence were raised only when evidence was being given in reply. I proceed, therefore, on the assumption that the plaintiffs failed to establish liability of the defendants under article 1053 C.C.\nIn considering the case presented under article 1054 C.C. several questions arise. That electricity is a thing within the purview of that article I entertain no doubt. Sed vide 3 Rev. Trimestrielle, pp. 1-19.\nIt is urged that the plaintiffs preferred their claim only under article 1053, and that, having failed to establish negligence or fault on the part of the defendants by positive evidence, they should not be permitted to fall back upon a presumption of fault under article 1054.\nThe fourth paragraph of each of the declarations of the several plaintiffs contains a general charge that electric current produced by and under the control of the defendants was, by their negligence, introduced into the plaintiffs' buildings at a very high tension, much in excess of that required for purposes of illumination, and that it caused the fires which occasioned the injuries complained of. In the sixth paragraph of each declaration defective installation of the defendants' system is charged. Upon application particulars were ordered of the defects charged under the latter paragraph; but particulars of the fault or negligence alleged in the fourth paragraph were refused\u2014apparently because that paragraph was regarded by the judge who heard the motion as merely an allegation under Article 1054 C.C. intended to cast upon the defendants the burden of proving that they could not have prevented the act which caused the damage sued for.\nMr. Justice Carroll and the learned trial judge, it is true, have expressed the view that, in making a claim under article 1054, it is sufficient to allege injury and consequent damage caused by a thing under the care of the defendant, without adding an allegation of fault or negligence. But the learned Chief Justice of Quebec, on the contrary, in a somewhat elaborate argument maintains the view that, while proof of fault is not necessary, an allegation of it in the pleadings is required. With very great respect, if a presumption of fault on the part of the defendant arises upon its being shewn that the injury complained of was caused by a thing under his care, I cannot understand why it should be necessary to allege more than this latter fact. But if a general allegation of fault is necessary, notwithstanding that the law presumes it, it is furnished by paragraph four, which was probably inserted to prevent difficulty should the view taken by the learned Chief Justice of Quebec prevail. In any case I agree with the learned trial judge that in making the allegation of fault contained in that paragraph the plaintiffs cannot be taken to have abandoned the advantage of their position under article 1054, but were on the contrary seeking to secure it.\nWhile still adhering to the view which I expressed in Shawinigan Carbide Co. v. Doucet[36], at pages 342, et seq., that, for reasons there stated, the sixth paragraph of article 1054 C.C. probably does not apply to the first paragraph of that article, in the present instance I proceed upon the assumption that either the sixth paragraph applies to the first as well as to the following paragraphs, or that, if not, the first paragraph is subject to a similar qualification, as had been held in regard to the corresponding article (1384) of the Code Napoleon, in which the application of the exculpatory clause, corresponding to the sixth paragraph of article 1054 C.C., to the first paragraph of article 1384 C.N. is clearly excluded. Recueil, Phily, 1909, p. 926, No. 5039.\nAssuming then that the defendant company could acquit itself of liability by proving that the introduction of high-voltage current into the plaintiffs' buildings was due to a cause the operation of which it \"could not prevent (2 Planiol, Droit Civil, Nos. 929-30-31) I am of the opinion that it has failed to discharge that burden. Wh\u00efle the evidence may be insufficient to enable us to say that it affirmatively establishes fault or negligence, it has, in my opinion, not been shewn ; that the defendants could not have prevented the occurrence of the fires in question either by grounding their transformers, by taking proper steps to secure the removal of the branch which fell or of the lower overhanging branches, which in this instance seem to have increased the danger, or by employing other means to guard their wires against the fall of the branch which broke them. It has not established that they were wholly free from fault.\nMoreover, I am not satisfied that, having regard to the contractual relations between the parties and to the defendants' knowledge of the danger to buildings of their customers attendant upon high-tension wires being carried in proximity to secondary wires connected with house services when their transformers were not grounded, it was not their duty to have disconnected the premises of their customers during a storm such as the witnesses describe, and until danger from its consequences had passed, failure to perform which entails liability for resultant injury.\nThe defendant company invokes a provision of the contracts under which it alleges electric current was supplied to the injured premises, whereby it was stipulated that\nthe company shall not be liable for damages resulting from electric current when its appliances shall have been installed according to the rules of, or approved by, the Board of Fire Underwriters.\nAssuming that it has been established that this provision is binding on the plaintiffs, the defendants failed to shew installation approved by, or in conformity with, the rules of the Board of Fire Underwriters. While it may be that actual enforcement of the decision of the underwriters to insist upon the grounding of transformers was deferred until after the fires in question had happened, the system of the defendant company was not in conformity with the rules of the Board and its disapproval had several times been brought to the attention of the company, which had promised a year before the date of the fires to improve its installation and to meet the requirements of the underwriters. The term of the contract which the company invokes, therefore, affords no answer to the plaintiff's claim.\nI would, for these reasons, allow this appeal with costs in this court and the Court of King's Bench, and would restore the judgment of the learned trial judge.\nBrodeur J.\u2014Nous avons \u00e0 d\u00e9cider dans ces causes-ci si l'intim\u00e9e, la Quebec Railway Light Heat and Power Company, doit supporter les dommages r\u00e9sultant de l'incendie des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s de l'appelant, M. Vandry, et de M. Chateauvert.\nLa compagnie intim\u00e9e fait l'\u00e9clairage de la ville de Qu\u00e9bec et de ses environs. Elle fournit aux particuliers la lumi\u00e8re dont ils ont besoin pour leurs maisons et en vertu des contrats qu'elle fait avec ses consommateurs elle leur transmet un courant electrique d'environ 110 volts qui n'offre que peu ou point de danger d'incendie ou de chocs violents. L'installation des fils \u00e9lectriques dans les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s priv\u00e9es est faite par les propri\u00e9taires; mais l'intim\u00e9e voit elle-m\u00eame \u00e0 faire dans les maisons les raccordements avec ses propres fils \u00e9lectriques. Au moyen d'instruments d'une pr\u00e9cision remarquable, elle peut s'assurer et d\u00e9terminer facilement et sans frais si l'installation du propri\u00e9taire est suffisante et convenable. Afin de ne pas fournir \u00e0 ses consommateurs un courant \u00e9lectrique plus consid\u00e9rable que ne le comportent ses conventions et l'usage, elle installe sur ses poteaux des transformateurs qui r\u00e9duisent de 2,200 volts \u00e0 environ 110 volts le courant \u00e9lectrique destin\u00e9 \u00e0 ses consommateurs.\nDans la nuit du 19 au 20 d\u00e9cembre, 1912, une branche de peuplier charg\u00e9e de verglas, qui surplombait la ligne de l'intim\u00e9e, s'est bris\u00e9e, est \u00e9videmment tomb\u00e9e sur la ligne et a \u00e9tabli une jonction entre le fil qui portait 2,200 volts et celui de 110 volts. Comme r\u00e9sultat de cette jonction, le fil \u00e9lectrique qui conduisait le courant aux maisons de MM. Vandry et Chateauvert s'est trouv\u00e9 charg\u00e9 d'un courant de 2,200 et a allum\u00e9 l'incendie qui les a d\u00e9truites.\nDe l\u00e0 l'action en responsabilit\u00e9 par M. Vandry et par les compagnies d'assurance qui ont pay\u00e9 une partie des pertes qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 subies lors de cet incendie.\nLa preuve qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite dans ces causes, qui ont toutes \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9unies dans une seule, est tr\u00e8s volumineuse et bien compl\u00e8te et elle offre aux tribunaux l'avantage de pouvoir se prononcer sur tous les faits et les incidents de la cause.\nOn a tent\u00e9 de circomscrire le d\u00e9bat et on s'est bas\u00e9 \u00e0 ce sujet sur des subtilit\u00e9s de proc\u00e9dures et de plaidoiries. On a pr\u00e9tendu, par exemple, que la d\u00e9claration des demandeurs devait n\u00e9cessairement restreindre le d\u00e9bat aux fautes particuli\u00e8res qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 sp\u00e9cifiquement all\u00e9gu\u00e9es.\nMais on oublie qu'il y a dans cette d\u00e9claration des all\u00e9gations g\u00e9n\u00e9rales de n\u00e9gligence et de faute qui ouvrent la porte \u00e0 toute preuve de n\u00e9gligence qui puisse \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e. De plus, comme je viens de le dire, la preuve a \u00e9t\u00e9 aussi compl\u00e8te que possible, couvre tous les faits et toutes les circonstances et par cons\u00e9quent ce serait bien malheureux maintenant que les parties ont fait valoir tous leurs moyens tant en demande qu'en d\u00e9fense de les restreindre \u00e0 des all\u00e9gations plus ou moins sp\u00e9cifiques. S'il y avait n\u00e9cessit\u00e9, d'ailleurs, cette cour, avec les pouvoirs qu'elle a d'amender les plaidoiries, devrait le faire afin que justice compl\u00e8te soit rendue aux parties. Mais je consid\u00e8re qu'il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire d'avoir, recours \u00e0 cela dans les circonstances.\nVoici une compagnie qui ne devait fournir \u00e0 ses clients, Vandry et Chateauvert, qu'un voltage de 110. A un moment donn\u00e9, le courant est port\u00e9 \u00e0 2,200 et a caus\u00e9 l'incendie qui a eu lieu et aurait pu \u00e9galement causer la mort de personnes qui, \u00e0 ce moment l\u00e0 auraient pu venir en contact avec ce courant mortel.\nIl est ind\u00e9niable que l'accident a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 par un courant \u00e9lectrique dont elle avait la garde et elle a en vertu de l'article 1054 du code civil engag\u00e9 sa responsabilit\u00e9, \u00e0 moins qu'elle ne prouve qu'elle n'a pu emp\u00eacher le fait qui a caus\u00e9 les dommages.\nIl est du devoir d'une compagnie qui exploite un commerc\u00e9 d'une nature aussi dangereuse de prendre toutes les pr\u00e9cautions n\u00e9cessaires qour emp\u00eacher tout accident qui pourrait se produire, ainsi que cette cour l'a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans la cause de Royal Electric Company v. H\u00e9v\u00e9[37].\nIl est en preuve que les compagnies d'assurance ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs reprises, par une correspondance qui est au dossier, que des incendies tr\u00e8s nombreux se produisaient \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 raison du fait que son syst\u00e8me n'\u00e9tait pas perfectionn\u00e9. On lui a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 naturellement de mettre \u00e0 ses transformateurs des fils \u00e9lectriques qui rejoindraient la terre et qui pr\u00e9viendraient dans une tr\u00e8s grande mesure, sinon enti\u00e8rement, ces incendies.\nL'intim\u00e9e a paru, \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9, dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 se rendre \u00e0 ces suggestions et au printemps de 1912 elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle n'attendait que le d\u00e9gel du terrain pour pouvoir faire ces travaux.\nMais le d\u00e9gel est arriv\u00e9, l'\u00e9t\u00e9 s'est pass\u00e9, rien n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait; et vers le milieu de d\u00e9cembre, 1912, l'incendie en question \u00e9tait allum\u00e9. Il a fallu un ordre de la commission des utilit\u00e9s publiques, l'ann\u00e9e suivante, pour forcer l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 faire ces am\u00e9liorations qui \u00e9taient jug\u00e9es n\u00e9cessaires.\nMais elle nous dit que cette mise en terre d'un fil \u00e9lectrique n'aurait pas produit le r\u00e9sultat voulu \u00e0 moins que les consommateurs n'am\u00e9liorent leur syst\u00e8me \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur. Sur ce point la preuve est loin d'\u00eatre certaine; mais alors pourquoi n'a-t-elle pas incit\u00e9 ses consommateurs \u00e0 faire des am\u00e9liorations voulues si elle croyait que leur syst\u00e8me \u00e9tait d\u00e9fectueux. C'\u00e9tait chose facile \u00e0 faire pour elle que de refuser \u00e0 ces consommateurs de leur donner le courant s'ils ne voulaient pas faire les am\u00e9liorations n\u00e9cessaires ou jug\u00e9es telles par le bureau des assureurs. C'\u00e9tait d'ailleurs une des conditions de son contrat avec ses consommateurs.\nCes am\u00e9liorations auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 dispendieuses et elle a pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 courir les risques d'un accident que de se rendre aux suggestions des compagnies.\nMaintenant je consid\u00e8re que l'intim\u00e9e est \u00e9galement responsable \u00e0 raison du fait qu'elle est all\u00e9e passer sa ligne \u00e0 un endroit o\u00f9 cette derni\u00e8re \u00e9tait susceptible d'\u00eatre frapp\u00e9e par des branches d'arbres (art. 1053 C.C.).\nElle a pr\u00e9text\u00e9 force majeure.\nCette excuse ne vaut rien. Tous les hivers et plusieurs fois dans nos hivers, nous avons ces pluies o\u00f9 l'eau tombe par gouttelettes sur les arbres, s'y cong\u00e8le et force les arbres \u00e0 plier et les am\u00e8ne \u00e0 se briser. C'est un cas d'occurrence si fr\u00e9quente que Ton ne peut raisonnablement pr\u00e9tendre que les compagnies qui fournissent du pouvoir ne sont pas tenues d'en tenir compte. Laurent, vol. 16, No. 265; 4 Aubry & Rau p. 104, note; 24 Demolombe No. 560.\nL'intim\u00e9e devait donc dans le cas actuel prot\u00e9ger ses fils contre le peuplier dont une branche s'est d\u00e9tach\u00e9e. Ces arbres, comme on le sait, se brisent facilement; et alors raison de plus pour la compagnie de se prot\u00e9ger contre ce danger qu'elle aurait pu facilement obtenir de faire disparaitre, mais elle n'a pas jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de le faire.\nJ'ai eu l'avantage de voir l'opinion de mon coll\u00e8que Anglin sur la responsabilit\u00e9 statutaire de la compagnie intim\u00e9e et j'y concours enti\u00e8rement. La legislature a accord\u00e9 \u00e0 la compagnie intim\u00e9e des pouvoirs consid\u00e9rables exorbitants m\u00eame du droit commun. (44 & 45 Vict. ch. 71 et 58 & 59 Vict, ch. 59.) Cette derni\u00e8re en effet a le droit de venir poser ses poteaux sur les chemins municipaux, qui sont cependant la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des municipalit\u00e9s, et ce sans payer d'indemnit\u00e9. Mais, d'un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, si dans l'exercice de ses pouvoirs ou dans l'exploitation de son industrie si dangereuse elle cause des dommages, le statut d\u00e9clare, suivant moi, qu'elle engage sa responsabilit\u00e9, qu'il y ait faute ou non de sa part.\nCette l\u00e9gislation n'est pas nouvelle. Nous la relevons dans plusieurs de nos lois. Ainsi, par exemple, le marchand de bois a le droit de se servir de cours d'eaux priv\u00e9s sans payer d'indemnit\u00e9. Mais s'il cause des dommages par n\u00e9gligence ou non il engage sa responsabilit\u00e9 (art. 2256 S. R: Que., 1909; art. 503 Code Civil; art. 1627 S. R. Que.). Dumont v. Fraser[38]. Les compagnies de chemins de fer qui incendiaient des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s avoisinant leurs voies \u00e9taient d'ordinaire tenues responsables de ces dommages, que leurs locomotives fussent bien ou mal construites. (Beauchamp, Code Civil, par. 175, sous l'art. 1053.) Le Conseil Priv\u00e9 ayant renvers\u00e9 cette jurisprudence et ayant d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans la cause de Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Roy[39] qu'une compagnie de chemin de fer qui aurait caus\u00e9 un incendie par des flamm\u00e8ches qui se seraient \u00e9chapp\u00e9es de l'une de ses locomotives dans l'exploitation ordinaire de son chemin n'\u00e9tait pas responsable des dommages caus\u00e9s, le Parlement est intervenu et a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans la section 298 de l'Acte des Chemins de fer qu'il y avait responsabilit\u00e9 de la part de la compagnie si ses locomotives causaient un incendie, qu'il y eut n\u00e9gligence ou non.\nAlors ce serait, suivant moi, une erreur de dire que la compagnie intim\u00e9e n'est responsable que dans le cas o\u00f9 une faute est prouv\u00e9e contre elle. Je suis d'opinion, au contraire, qu'elle est responsable dans tous les cas o\u00f9 elle cause des dommages, quand bien m\u00eame ces dommages ne r\u00e9sulteraient d'aucun acte de n\u00e9gligence.\nJe consid\u00e8re donc que dans les circonstances la compagnie doit \u00eatre tenue responsable de l'accident qui s'est produit chez le demandeur, M. Vandry, et chez M. Chateauvert, et je consid\u00e8re que le jugement de la cour d'appel, qui a maintenu la d\u00e9fense de l'intim\u00e9e, est mal fond\u00e9 et que l'appel doit \u00eatre maintenu avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Taschereau, Roy, Cannon & Parent.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Pentland, Stuart, Gravel & Thomson.\n[1] Q.K. 24 K.B. 214.\n[2] [1902] A.

V., c. 5, Intestate estates.\nIn 1911, certain lands of the Dominion of Canada, situate in the Province of Alberta, were granted in fee to a person who died, in 1912, intestate and without heirs, being still seized in fee simple of the lands.\nHeld, Idington and Brodeur JJ. dissenting, that the right of escheat arising in consequence of the intestacy and failure of heirs was a royalty reserved to the Dominion of Canada by virtue of the 21st section of the \"Alberta Act,\" 4 & 5 Edw. VII., ch. 3, and belonged to the Crown for the purposes of Canada. Attorney-General of Ontario v. Mercer (8 App. Cas. 767), followed.\nPer Davies and Anglin JJ.\u2014It was not competent for the Legislature of the Province of Alberta, by the statute of 1915, 5 Geo. V., ch. 5, relating to the property of intestates dying without next of kin, to affect the rights so reserved to the Dominion of Canada.\nPer Idington and Brodeur JJ.\u2014Upon the grant of the lands in question by the Dominion Government they ceased to be Crown lands of the Dominion and royalties reserved to the Dominion could not attach thereto. Further, the effect of section 3 of the Dominion statute, 51 Vict. ch. 20, amending the \"Territories Real Property Act,\" R.S.C. 1886, ch. 51, and declaring that lands in the North-West Territories should go to the personal representatives of the deceased owner thereof in the same manner as personal estate, constituted an absolute renunciation of all such claims to royalties by the Crown in the right of the Dominion of Canada.\nThe appeal from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, (15 Ex. C.R. 403) was dismissed. APPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], maintaining the prayer of the information filed by the Attorney-General for Canada and declaring that the lands in question, upon the death of the owner intestate and without next of kin, escheated to the Crown in the right of the Dominion of Canada.\nThe questions in issue on the present appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nFrank Ford K.C. for the appellants.\nW. D. Hogg K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The Attorney-General for Canada by information filed in the Exchequer Court, claimed a declaration that certain lands in the Province of Alberta of which one Yard Rafstadt, who died intestate and without heirs, was formerly the owner had escheated to His Majesty in right of the Dominion of Canada.\nThe claim is similar to that put forward in the Privy Council in the appeal of Attorney-General of Ontario v. Mercer[2], by the Dominion Government in the name of the respondent. In that case the lands of which the deceased who died intestate and without heirs had been the owner were situate in the Province of Ontario. By the judgment it was held that lands escheated to the Crown for want of heirs belonged to the province and not to the Dominion. The ground of the decision was that although section 102 of the \"British North America Act, 1867,\" imposed upon the Dominion the charge of the general public revenue as then existing of the provinces yet, by section 109, the casual revenue arising from lands escheated to the Crown after the Union was reserved to the provinces\u2014the words \"land, mines, minerals and royalties,\" therein including, according to their true construction, royalties in respect of lands, such as escheats.\nWhat is now the Province of Alberta was formerly a part of the North-West Territories under the sole authority of the Dominion Government. Up to the time of the establishment of the province, by the statute 4 & 5 Edw. VII., ch. 3, there could be no doubt to whom the lands and their revenues belonged. Lest there should be any doubt as to the position of the public lands in the Province of Alberta the Act by which it was established provided by section 21 that all Crown lands, mines, minerals and royalties incident thereto should continue to be vested in the Crown and administered by the Government of Canada for the purposes of Canada. The words are practically the same as those in section 109 of the \"British North America Act, 1867,\" from which they are doubtless taken whereby the like reservation was made in favour of the provinces.\nI do not myself understand how, in face of the decision of the Judicial Committee, it can be contended that the same words which were held to reserve to the provinces the casual revenue arising from lands escheated to the Crown should now receive the opposite meaning and be held not to include royalties in respect of lands such as escheats.\nI am not sure that it is very necessary to deal with the arguments put forward on behalf of the province. They seem to be largely those urged and expressly negatived in the Mercer Case[3]. The present appellant in his factum claims that \"the word 'royalties' has relation back only to mines and minerals.\" This was, perhaps, the main contention put forward by the Dominion in the Mercer Case[4], and their Lordships say, a p. 779:\u2014\nThe question is whether the word \"royalties\" ought to be restrained to rights connected with mines and minerals only, to the exclusion of royalties, such as escheats, in respect of lands. Their Lordships find nothing in the subject, or the context, or in any other part of the Act, to justify such a restriction of its sense.\nIt is useless to ask us to find now that the word in the same subject and context has the opposite meaning to that placed upon it by their Lordships.\nJudgment for the respondent on this appeal does not involve any decision as to the right of the legislature of the province to change the laws of inheritance. Lands escheat to the Crown for defect of heirs and this has nothing to do with the question who are a person's heirs. But altering the law of inheritance is one thing and appropriating the right of the Dominion on failure of heirs is quite another thing. This is what has been done by the Alberta statute, chap. 5 of 1915. The statute in terms deals with property of a person dying\nintestate and without leaving any next of, kin or other person entitled thereto.\nIt is because there is no one who can claim the property that the Crown takes it. There is no possibility of getting at this property through the deceased. The Crown does not claim it by succession at all, but because there is no succession.\nIn the Mercer Case4, the Judicial Committee say:\u2014\nTheir Lordships are not now called upon to decide whether the word \"royalties\" in section 109 of the \"British North America Act, 1867,\" extends to other royal rights besides those connected with \"lands, mines and minerals.\"\nIt is not necessary in the present case either to decide this question. The right of the Crown to bona vacantia is a different one from the right to an escheat. No question as to the former right really arises in this case and I do not express any opinion as to whether it belongs to the Crown in the right of the Dominion or of the province. The question will have to be decided if necessary in a proper case.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nDavies J.\u2014Concurred with Anglin J.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014One Rafstadt the registered owner of a quarter section in Alberta who had obtained a certificate of title therefor, under the \"Land Titles Act,\" died intestate without leaving heirs at law or next of kin.\nThe land had been granted to him on the 25th of July, 1911, by the Crown acting through the administration of the Department of the Interior of Canada.\nThe claim made that the said land escheated to and became vested in the respondent in right of the Dominion of Canada has been maintained by the Exchequer Court and the appellant, the administrator, having sold the land and administered the estate of deceased, has been ordered by said court to account to the respondent in right of the Dominion.\nI respectfully submit that there seems to be thus presented a curious confusion of thought at the very threshold of this litigation.\nIf, as claimed by respondent and as held below, the Act, upon which the appellant acted as administrator is ultra vires, then nothing which that court can do, or we in reviewing its action and maintaining same view can do, will be of any avail.\nThe title to the land is, in such view, in respondent or liable to become so vested upon inquisition duly found. The Crown certainly cannot desire that innocent persons purchasing from or claiming through the purchaser from the appellant should suffer loss, as they inevitably must when, if ever, it is finally determined that the Act apparently constituting the appellant owner was ultra vires and all it had done thereunder null and void.\nIf I were driven to entertain the same view I should feel much embarrassed in maintaining such a judgment fraught with such obvious consequences unless and until proper concurrent legislation had been enacted adopting and validating the appellant's sale and remitting the trial of the right to the proceeds to the courts to determine.\nHowever praiseworthy saving costs and going directly to the point may be as a rule, there are some cases where it cannot be done properly. And if the correct conclusion is as held below the proceedings herein should be stayed or the action dismissed.\nThe respondent can have no claim to money improperly received by appellant or any one else in Alberta unless under such circumstances that he can properly affirm the transaction and be no party to something detrimental to some of his subjects.\nPassing that phase of this litigation and coming to the issue attempted to be raised and decided herein, let us ask ourselves what an escheat is and consider the \"definition thereof as given in Stroud's Judicial Dictionary, vol. 2, page 639, condensed from Coke upon Littleton, as follows:\u2014\nEscheat is a word of art, and signifieth properly when, by accident, the lands fall to the lord of whom they are holden, in which case we say the fee is escheated.\nThen let us bear in mind that the very basis of the argument in support of the view contended for by respondent herein is the tenure by which the land is assumed to have been held and that it has to be presumed a grant had been made by the lord of an estate which for want of heirs has come to an end, and by reason thereof the land has fallen to the lord who had made the grant. Such is the theory rested upon.\nThe respondent, it is claimed, must be held in this case to be the lord so entitled.\nTo make no doubt of the theory and its resting upon tenure as the basis of this claim we have but to consider the illustrations furnished by cases where the estate is held upon a copyhold tenure when the title escheats to the lord of the manor. See in Watson's \"Compendium of Equity,\" the chapter on \"Escheat and Forefeiture,\" page 187, and cases cited there, especially Walker v. Denne[5] at page 187, where Lord Loughborough, then Lord Chancellor, expressly says the title would not escheat to the Crown but to the lord of the manor. See also the more recent cases of Weaver v. Maule[6]; Gallard v. Hawkins[7], and especially at pages 306-7.\nThis last mentioned case brings forward another view, dealt with in Watson's work at pages 186-7, where it is explained that, until 47 & 48 Vict. ch. 71, equitable estates did not escheat to the Crown for they were not the subject of tenure and where there was a conveyance or devise in trust and there was no heir of the grantor or testator the trustee held for his own use absolutely.\nThe case of Burgess v. Wheate[8], contains elaborate learning on the subject, and the much more recent case of Cox v. Parker[9], presents the law in a very concise judgment of Sir John Romilly, Master of the Rolls.\nThese cases and many others make clear that the escheat of land is dependent on tenure and the title to the land only falls to the Crown in case by reason of the nature of the tenure thereof under the Crown such is the legal result when there is no one left to take the legal estate.\nLet us now consider the nature of the tenure of the lands in question herein and see if and how it can ever produce such a result as contended for by respondent herein.\nIf ever legislation could sweep away such a right as escheat in relation to land so far as dependent on tenure surely the enactment of 51 Vict. ch. 20, sec. 3, did so.\nIt enacted as follows:\u2014\n3. Section five of the said Act is hereby repealed, and the following substituted therefor:\n5. Land in the Territories shall go to the personal representatives of the deceased owner thereof in the same manner as personal estate now goes.\nThat was a comprehensive declaration of the Dominion Parliament relative to the doctrine of tenure upon which alone the escheat of land so far as dependent on tenure could rest. It was an absolute renunciation by the respondent, by assenting thereto, of any such possible claim.\nIt was repeated in section 3 of the \"Land Titles Act\" of 1894.\nAnd in the same session in which the Province of Alberta was created, and as declaratory of the policy of parliament in that regard, it was enacted by the respondent's assent given same day as the \"Alberta Act\" was assented to as follows:\u2014\n1. Upon, the establishment of a province in any portion of the North-West Territories and the enactment by the legislature of that province of an Act relating to the registration of land titles, the Governor in Council may, by order, repeal the provisions of the \"Land Titles Act, 1894,\" and of any of its amending Acts in so far as they apply to the said province, and by such order, or by any subsequent order or orders, may adjust all questions arising between the Government of Canada and the Government of the province by reason of the provisions of this section being carried into effect.\nIn pursuance thereof the Alberta Legislature at its first session enacted a \"Land Titles Act\" carrying out the purpose so designed and by the language thereof put beyond doubt, so far as it could, the possibility of any such thing as escheat dependent on tenure. It enacted as follows:\u2014\n74. Whenever the owner of any land for which a certificate has been granted dies, such land shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, vest in the personal representative of the deceased owner, who shall, before dealing with such land, make application in writing to the registrar to be registered as owner and shall produce to the registrar the probate of the will of the deceased owner, or letters of administration, or the order of the court authorizing him to administer the estate of the deceased owner, or a duly certified copy of the said probate, letters of administration or order, as the case may be; and thereupon the registrar shall enter a memorandum thereof upon the certificate of title; and for the purposes of this Act the probate of a will granted by the proper court of any province of the Dominion of Canada, or of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, or an exemplification thereof, shall be sufficient.\n2. If the certificate of title for the land has not been granted to the deceased owner the personal representatives before being entitled to be registered under this section shall bring the land under this Act in the ordinary way.\n3. Upon such memorandum being made, the executor or administrator, as the case may be, shall be deemed to be the owner of the land; and the registrar shall note the fact of the registration by a memorandum under his hand on the probate of the will, letters of administration, order or other instrument as aforesaid.\n4. The title of the executor or administrator to the land shall relate back and take effect as from the date of the death of the deceased owner.\nSurely the respondent by acting upon this local legislation stipulated for in the enactment of Parliament above quoted must be taken to have assented thereto as if bargained for when in pursuance thereof he by order-in-council repealed the \"Land Titles Act\" of 1894.\nThe grant in question herein was made in pursuance of that policy and registered in conformity therewith.\nDoes it not seem repugnant to reason that such a claim as escheat by virtue of tenure could be permitted to spring from such grants and rest upon such a foundation? That legislation by Parliament and legislature adopted and carried into force by said order-in-council was, I submit, as absolute and final a renunciation by respondent in right of the Dominion as could be conceivable.\nIt is argued, however, that by reason of the Dominion having retained the control of the disposition of the Crown lands in Alberta, it must be taken to have intended to reserve to itself such incidental sources of revenue as might result from escheat.\nThe \"Alberta Act,\" by section 21 thereof, enacted as follows:\u2014\n21. All Crown lands, mines and minerals and royalties incident thereto, and the interest of the Crown in the waters within the province under the \"North-West Irrigation Act, 1898,\" shall continue to be vested in the Crown and administered by the Government of Canada for the purposes of Canada, subject to the provisions of any Act of the Parliament of Canada with respect to road allowances and roads or trails in force immediately before the coming into force of this Act, and shall apply to the said province with the substitution therein of the said province for the North-West Territories.\nWhen we are called upon to interpret and construe this enactment I think we can refer not only to the whole scope of the Act but also as in pari materi\u00e2 the enactments passed in same session bearing upon the policy of Parliament in its relation to the powers to be conferred upon the Alberta Legislature and especially that enactment already referred to which provided for that legislature carrying out the policy of Parliament relative to the tenure of lands and their transmission in cases of intestates.\nHaving due regard not only to the \"Alberta Act\" itself but also these other enactments, it seems inconceivable that whatever Parliament intended, it could ever have sought to reserve to the respondent in right of the Dominion any such thing as escheat dependent upon tenure of the land.\nThere remains, however, the question of the right of the Crown to become possessed of bona vacantia quite independently of tenure. That sometimes is spoken of as a right to an escheat.\nOf the existence of that right, call it what we may, there can, in light of the authorities such as Taylor v. Haygarth[10], and in In re Bond; Panes v. Attorney-General[11]; Dyke v. Walford[12], and In re Barnett's Trusts[13], be no doubt. Each is illustrative of the varying condition under which the right may exist.\nAnd if the respondent had sued appellant to recover the proceeds of the estate left after its due administration the question would arise whether such balance could be treated as bona vacantia falling to respondent in right of the Dominion or in right of the Province of Alberta.\nThen we should have to consider the neat point in light of the following provision of the \"Alberta Act,\" 5 Edw. VII., ch. 3, sec. 3, as follows:\u2014\n3. The provisions of the \"British North America Acts,\" 1867 to 1886, shall apply to the Province of Alberta in the same way and to the like extent as they apply to the provinces heretofore comprised in the Dominion, and if the said Province of Alberta had been one of the provinces originally united, except in so far as varied by this Act and except such provisions as are in terms made, or by reasonable intendment may be held to be, specially applicable to or only to affect one or more and not the whole of the said provinces. Wherein do the provisions of the \"British North America Acts \"differ from those thus made applicable to the Province of Alberta?\nIt is said the provisions of the section 21, above quoted, make a difference.\nTrue, the management of the Crown domain is reserved as a matter of public policy for the Dominion, but how can that touch anything turning upon the right of the respondent to recover bona vacantia on behalf of the Dominion?\nThere is nothing in the language of section 21 reaching so far as to require such a meaning to be given it.\nThere may arise cases similar to that which enabled the Court dealing with personal property in the hands of executors, in question in the case of Taylor v. Haygarth[14], cited above. Can it be said in such a case that bona vacantia derived from or being mere personal property is to be held recoverable by the respondent on behalf of the Dominion, instead of by him on behalf of the province?\nSurely the reservation of the revenue from the sales and leasing of lands, mines and minerals is rather a shadowy foundation for such a claim. Yet there is nothing else in this \"Alberta Act\" distinguishing the status and powers of the new province from others in that regard which can be relied upon.\nThe right of the other provinces to escheat had been long determined in their favour by the case of the Attorney-General for Ontario v. Mercer[15], when the \"Alberta Act\" was passed and if there had been any such purpose as making a distinction in that regard against the new province it would have found expression in the Act in some more explicit way than by such indirect language as used in section 21.\nAnd when the claim to bona vacantia is made how can it rest upon the single line\nAll Crown lands, mines, minerals and royalties incidental thereto\nfor that is what the matter comes to?\nThere is nothing therein which in the remotest sense can extend to mere bona vacantia consisting of or derivable from personal property.\nAnd with the claim thereto surely must fall also the claim to proceeds of real estate which had been declared at that time to become distributable as personal property.\nAnd let us again observe the language of the first line of section 21 which defines nothing of that sort. Only the word \"royalties\" therein can be taken to have any possible semblance of meaning applicable to what is involved in the claim.\nAnd these royalties are not presented as jura regalia but as \"royalties incident thereto,\" i.e. incident to the \"Crown lands, mines and minerals.\"\nIn common parlance we all know how the term \"royalties\" is used relative to the timber dues and any share of the minerals extracted under and by virtue of leases of mines or mining lands. How can such a term be made to have such an extended meaning as claimed herein?\nThe moment the lands are granted by the Crown they cease to be \"Crown lands\" and how a royalty can attach thereto puzzles one.\nAgain we must never forget that the whole subject of property and civil rights is relegated to the jurisdiction of the legislature of the province which can change the whole law of descent and constitute whomsoever or whatsoever it sees fit the heir at law or next of kin entitled to take the estate of an intestate or indeed if it saw fit could revoke the power to make a will and distribute the estates of deceased in such a way as it might determine.\nTo say that a legislature possessed of such plenary powers cannot enact such a law as declared by the judgment appealed from to be ultra vires seems to me somewhat remarkable.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs throughout and the judgment appealed from be reversed.\nAnglin J.\u2014In this proceeding the Government of Canada seeks to recover from the administrator of one Yard Rafstadt, who died in November, 1912, in the Province of Alberta, intestate and without heirs or next of kin, the proceeds left in his hands, after satisfying claims of creditors, of land granted to the intestate in 1911, by letters patent issued from the Department of the Interior of Canada, of which he died seized.\nThe substance of an arrangement between the parties is that, if, upon the death of Rafstadt, the Crown in right of the Dominion of Canada was entitled to the land owned by him, either as an escheat or as bona vacantia, the net proceeds of the sale of such land in the hands of the administrator shall for all purposes be deemed the property of the Crown in right of the Dominion\u2014that they shall represent the land.\nA doubt was suggested as to the jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court to entertain this action on the ground that the money in question is in fact neither land escheated nor property of the Crown in right of the Dominion. The relief claimed by the information, however, is primarily a declaration that the land owned by Rafstadt upon his death\nescheated to and became vested in His Majesty the King in right of the Dominion of Canada,\nThat relief may properly be claimed in the Exchequer Court under 9 & 10 Edw. VII., (D.), chap. 18, sec. 2. The judgment has taken this declaratory form and a clause has been added, based upon the consent of parties, for the recovery by the Crown of the net proceeds of the sale held by the administrator.\nThe material facts were established by admissions and are fully stated in the judgment of the learned judge of the Exchequer Court.\nCounsel for the appellant urges several distinct grounds of appeal:\u2014\n(1) That the right of property in the lands surrendered by the Hudson Bay Company to Her late Majesty Queen Victoria, was never vested in the Crown in right of the Dominion of Canada;\n(2) That the right of escheat, if not vested in His Majesty in right of the United Kingdom, is vested in the Crown in right of the Province of Alberta;\n(3) That the reservation made by section 21 of the \"Alberta Act\" does not include the royalties of escheat or bona vacantia;\n(4) That under the Dominion \"Land Titles Act,\" 57 & 58 Vict., ch. 28 (1894), the holder of a certificate of title obtained not merely an estate in the land but the full allodial rights therein and that it was, therefore, not subject to escheat;\n(5) That under section 3 of that Act providing that\nland in the Territories shall go to the personal representatives in the same manner as personal estate now goes, and be dealt with and distributed as personal estate,\nthe real property of a deceased owner became for all purposes personalty, and, while a case of bona vacantia might arise in respect of it, \u00e2 case of escheat could not.\n(1) I doubt if the appellant, claiming through a grant from the Canadian Government, should be heard to raise the first point, if it were otherwise tenable. But that all the property rights both of the Crown and of the company in those parts of the former Hudson Bay Lands which were not reserved for the company were vested in the Crown in right of the Dominion of Canada, is, I think, fully established. The original grant to the Hudson Bay Company; the \"Rupert's Land. Act,\" 31 & 32 Vict. (Imp.) ch. 105; the surrender by the Hudson Bay Company to the Crown; the addresses of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada to Her Majesty; and the Imperial order-in-council passed pursuant to the \"Rupert's Land Act\" contain the history of the arrangement and the steps by which the territory that had formerly been held by the Hudson Bay Company (saying the reserved sections) became vested in the Crown and subject to the legislative control of the Parliament of Canada.\nThat Parliament exercised the power thus conferred upon it of legislating in regard to the Crown lands in the territory thus acquired. The first \"Dominion Lands Act,\" passed in 1872 (35 Vict. ch. 23), after designating them in the preamble as \"certain of the public lands of the Dominion\" enacted that the\nlands in Manitoba and the North-West Territories * * * shall be styled and known as Dominion lands.\nThe Act further provided for the administration and alienation of these lands in a manner consistent only with the assertion of the existence in the Dominion of the fullest proprietary rights therein. These provisions are continued in the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1886, ch. 54, and the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1906, ch. 55, and it is under the authority of that legislation that the patent or grant to Yard Rafstadt issued. Section 21 of the \"Alberta Act,\" (4 & 5 Edw. VII., ch. 3) may also, if necessary, be invoked as legislation, within the power conferred on the Dominion Parliament by the \"Rupert's Land Act,\" declaratory of the title and interest of the Crown in right of the Dominion in the public lands within the territorial limits of the Province of Alberta. On this branch of the case I concur in the conclusion reached by the learned judge of the Exchequer Court.\n(2) and The second and third points can be conveniently dealt with together. By the 21st section of the \"Alberta Act,\" (4 & 5 Edw. VII., ch. 3), it is declared that\nAll Crown lands, mines and minerals and royalties incident thereto * * * shall continue to be vested in the Crown and administered by the Government of Canada for the purposes of Canada.\nIn Attorney-General of Ontario v. Mercer[16], the Judicial Committee considered the provisions of section 109 of the \"British North America Act\" that\nAll lands, mines, minerals and royalties belonging to the several provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick at the Union * * * shall belong to the several Provinces of Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick in which the same are situated or arise.\nTheir Lordships held that \"royalties\" in this context includes escheat. After discussing the meaning of the term \"royalties\" and the nature of the objects which it covers, they say, at page 779:\u2014\nTheir Lordships are not now called upon to decide whether the word \"royalties\" in section 109 of the \"British North America Act\" of 1867 extends to other royal rights besides those connected with \"lands,\" \"mines\" and \"minerals.\" The question is whether it ought to be restrained to rights connected with mines and minerals only, to the exclusion of royalties, such as escheats, in respect of lands. Their Lordships find nothing in the subject, or the context, or in any other part of the Act, to justify such a restriction of its sense.\nThe restriction of the reservation of royalties in the \"Alberta Act\" to those incident to Crown lands, mines and minerals, does not distinguish the case at bar from the Mercer Case[17], since their Lordships there proceeded on the assumption that only royalties \"connected with lands, mines and minerals,\" are covered by section 109 of the \"British North America Act\" (p. 779); nor does the omission of the words \"in which the same are situated or arise\" from the section of the \"Alberta Act\" render the decision in the Mercer Case17, inapplicable. The right of escheat is a royalty incident to \"Crown lands,\" or lands belonging to the Crown, and that royalty or right in respect to such lands in Alberta is declared by the \"Alberta Act\" to continue to be vested in the Crown for the purposes of Canada. I am, therefore, of the opinion that escheats arising in the Province of Alberta at all events in respect of lands which belonged to the Crown at the date of the creation of that province Were amongst the rights and sources of revenue excepted and reserved to the Dominion by section 21 of the \"Alberta Act.\"\n(4) The grant by the Crown to the Hudson Bay Company of the lands comprised in the territory granted to it was \"in free and common soccage.\" All lands in that territory conveyed by the company to settlers or others prior to the surrender by the company to Her late Majesty Queen Victoria and the subsequent transfer to the Dominion were held by that tenure. By an Act of the Dominion Parliament passed in preparation for the assumption of control of Rupert's Land by Canada it was provided that all the laws in force in Rupert's Land and in the North-Western Territory at the time of their admission into the Union shall, so far as they are consistent with the \"British North America Act, 1867\", with the terms and conditions of such admission approved of by the Queen under the\" 146th section thereof, and with this Act, remain in force until altered by the Parliament of Canada or by the Lieutenant-Governor under the authority of this Act, (32 & 33 Vict. chap. 3, sec. 5).\nThis legislation, which left in force English law as it stood in 1670, the date of the Hudson Bay Company's charter, subject possibly to some question as to the portions of the region which may have been first occupied by French settlers (Clement on the Constitution, (2nd ed.), p. 54, n. 4), was re-enacted after the actual admission of the territory into the Union (34 Vict. chap. 16). In 1886 the Dominion Parliament enacted that\nAll the laws of England relating to civil and criminal matters, as the same existed on the 15th day of July, 1870, shall be in force in the Territories in so far as the same are applicable to the Territories (49 Vict., ch. 25, sec. 3).\nSince the statute of Charles II., free and common soccage has been the ordinary tenure on which freehold lands are held in England and it is the tenure prescribed in all the early colonial charters or patents in America (Blackstone, Lewis's edition, vol. 1, page 78, n. 1). The habendum in the patent to Rafstadt, put in by consent, was \"in fee simple,\" making it clear that his estate was a fee simple to be held in free and common socage, to which the royalty of escheat has always been incident (11 Hals., page 24).\nIn the second volume of his commentaries (Lewis's edition, at page 104-5), Blackstone wrote:\u2014\n1. Tenant in fee simple (or, as he is frequently styled, tenant in fee) is he that hath lands, tenements, or hereditaments, to hold to him and to his heirs forever; generally, absolutely and simply; without mentioning what heirs, but referring that to his own pleasure, or to the disposition of the law. The true meaning of the word fee (feodum) is the same with that of feud or fief, and in its original sense it is taken in contradiction to allodium which latter the writers on this subject define to be every man's own land, which he possesseth merely in his own right, without owing any rent or service to any superior. This is property in its highest degree; and the owner thereof hath absolutum et directum dominium, and therefore is said to be seised thereof absolutely in dominico suo, in his own demense. But feodum, or fee, is that which is held of some superior, on condition of rendering him service; in which superior the ultimate property of the land resides. And therefore Sir Henry Spelman defines a feud or fee to be the right which the vassal or tenant hath in lands, to use the same, and take the profits thereof to him and his heirs, rendering to the lord his due services; the mere allodial property of the soil always remaining in the lord. This allodial property no subject in England has; it being a received, and now undeniable principle in the law, that all the lands in England are holden mediately or immediately of the king. The king therefore only hath absolutum et directum dominium: but all subjects' lands are in the nature of feodum or fee; whether derived to them by descent from their ancestors, or purchased for a valuable consideration; for they cannot come to any man by either of those ways, unless accompanied with those feudal clogs which were laid upon the first feudatory when it was originally granted. A subject therefore hath only the usufruct, and not the absolute property of the soil; or, as Sir Edward Coke expresses it, he hath dominium utile, but not dominium directum. And hence it is, that, in the most solemn acts of law, we express the strongest and, highest estate that any subject can have by these words:\u2014\"he is seised thereof in his demesne, 'as of fee.'\" It is a man's demesne, dominicum, or property, since it belongs to him and his heirs forever: yet this dominicum property or demesne, is strictly not absolute or allodial, but qualified or feudal: it is his demesne, as of fee: that is, it is not purely and simply his own, since it is held of a superior lord, in whom the ultimate property resides.\nIn any part of the King's dominions where the English legal system prevails it would require legislation very clear and explicit indeed to take from the Crown its allodial interest and vest it in the subject. There is no such legislation in regard to land in Alberta, and, so far as it might affect the reservation in favour of the Dominion made by section 21 of the \"Alberta Act,\" provincial legislation intended to have that effect, would be ultra vires.\nThe appellant invokes the provisions of the Dominion \"Land Titles Act,\" 1894 (57 & 58 Vict., ch. 28), making special reference to sections 3,4 and 10, as indicating the purpose of the Dominion Parliament to have been that in the North-West Territories a grant of land from the Crown followed by registration under the \"Land Titles Act\" should vest in the grantee the absolute or allodial title and that land so granted and registered should for all purposes be converted into and be subject to the incidents of personal property. But the definition in the Dominion \"Land Titles Act\" of 1894 of the word \"grant\" as meaning \"any grant from the Crown of land whether in fee or for years\" the definition of the word \"owner\" as meaning \"any person or body corporate entitled to any freehold or other estate or interest in land,\" the provision of section 56 that\nthe land mentioned in any certificate of title granted under this Act shall by implication and without any special mention therein, unless the contrary is expressly declared, be subject to (a) any subsisting reservations or exceptions contained in the original grant from the Crown,\nand the provision of section 57 that\nEvery certificate of title granted under this Act shall * * * be conclusive evidence * * * that the person named therein is entitled to the land included in the same for the estate or interest therein specified, subject to the exceptions and reservations mentioned in the preceding section,\nafford striking and, I think, conclusive, proof that it was not intended by this legislation to affect any such radical change as would be involved in vesting in the grantees of Crown lands in the North-West Territories (as they then were) not merely the fee simple of the lands granted\u2014\"the strongest and highest estate that any subject can have\"\u2014but also the allodial rights of the Crown. While section 4 dispenses with words of limitation in transfers and provides that, if used, they shall have the like force and meaning as if used in connection with personal property, this provision does not apply to Crown grants and the effect of a transfer is declared to be to pass \"all such right and title as the transferror has\"\u2014not the allodial rights in the land. While section 10 speaks of an \"absolute estate,\" it so denominates an estate in fee simple, which may not be reduced by words of limitation to a limited fee or fee-tail. Far from indicating an intention to confer an allodial interest on grantees of the Crown these sections evince an intention that the greatest estate of a subject\u2014that in fee simple\u2014 shall be the nature of the holding.\nThis statute was repealed as to Alberta by order-in-council of the 22nd July, 1906, authorized by statute 4 & 5 Edw. VII., chap. 18.\n(4) and (5) Section 3 of the Act so repealed\u2014reproduced in the Alberta \"Land Titles Act\"\u2014is as follows:\u2014\nLand in the Territories (Alberta) shall goto the personal representative of the deceased owner thereof in the same manner as personal estate now goes, and be dealt with and distributed as personal estate.\nAs originally introduced, in 1886 (49 Vict. ch. 26, sec. 5), the prototype of this provision read\nAll lands in the Territories which by the common law are regarded as real estate shall be held to be chattels real and shall go to the executor or administrator of any person or persons dying, seised or possessed thereof as other personal estate now passes to the personal representative.\nBut this section was repealed in 1888 (51 Vict. ch. 20, sec. 3), and the provision then substituted read\nLand in the Territories shall go to the personal representative of the deceased owner thereof in the same manner as personal estate now goes.\nNo substantial change was made by the Act of 1894 (57 & 58 Vict., ch. 28, sec. 3, above quoted). The omission from these later enactments of the words \"shall be held to be chattels real\" is significant and shews that, at all events since 1888, whatever may have been the case under the Act of 1886, land is still land and it is only for purposes of descent and distribution that it is to be regarded as personalty. Otherwise it remains land and subject to all the incidents of land. On the death of an owner of land intestate and without heirs he leaves nothing to be dealt with as a subject of descent or distribution. On his death his estate in the land comes to an end and, eo instanti, the Crown, by virtue, of the escheat, is seised of the land which had been his. There is nothing to pass to a personal representative.\nThe legislation relied upon is, no doubt, effective to convert into personalty, and to attach to it all the incidents of personalty, for purposes of succession and distribution, whatever estate or interest the deceased owner held in his real property. But it leaves untouched the allodial interest or \"ultimate property\" which remained resident in the Crown after the grant of the fee and by virtue of which, on the death of the owner intestate and without heirs, the fee having determined, the Crown was again seised of the land as it had been before the grant. Nothing passed to the personal representative of the owner. There was nothing upon which the provisions of section 3 could operate. The owner's interest simply ceased to exist. As put in Attorney-General of Ontario v. Mercer[18], at page 772,\nWhen there is no longer any tenant, the land returns by reason of tenure, to the lord by whom or by whose predecessors in title, the tenure was created * * * The tenant's estate (subject to any charges upon it which he may have created) has come to an end and the lord is in by his own right.\nWhile it is no doubt competent to the legislature of the Province of Alberta, subject to the restrictions of section 21 of the \"Alberta Act,\" to determine the tenure of land in that province and to amend the law of descent, it cannot deal with either of these matters so as to affect the rights by that section reserved to the Crown in right of the Dominion, including inter alia the right of escheat. In so far as it may purport to do so chapter 5 of the Alberta statutes of 1915 is ultra vires.\nI would, for these reasons, dismiss this appeal with costs.\nBrodeur J (dissenting).\u2014For the reasons given by Mr. Justice Idington, I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed with costs throughout.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Emery, Newell, Ford, Bolton & Mount.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Hogg & Hogg.\n[1] 15 Ex.

C. Trenholme v. McLennan (24 L. C. Jur. 305), overruled.\nJudgment appealed from (Q.R. 24 K.B. 151), reversed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side[1], affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal, by which the plaintiffs' action was dismissed with costs.\nThe plaintiffs, who were brokers and members of the Montreal Corn Exchange, were instructed by the defendant to purchase oats for future delivery and sale on his account in anticipation of a rise in the market. The plaintiffs carried out several transactions, according to alleged instructions, which resulted in a net loss, and brought the action to recover the balance claimed to be due on settlements and for commission and outlay for freight and storage charges. The action was dismissed by the Superior Court on the ground that the plaintiffs had failed to adduce evidence of any memorandum in writing signed by the defendant, or by the customary brokers' bought-and-sold notes, shewing the actual purchase of the oats and their authority to make the purchases and sales on the defendant's account. This decision was affirmed by the judgment now appealed from.\nThe questions in issue on the present appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nR. C. Smith K.C. and George H. Montgomery K.C. for the appellants.\nA. W. Atwater K.C. and Mailhiot for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The only point for our decision in this case is whether the plaintiff, the present appellant, was entitled to give oral evidence as to the transactions which the respondent commissioned them to carry out on his behalf.\nIn a number of similar cases, including the case in the Privy Council of Forget v. Baxter[2], it has been pointed out that the onus is upon the plaintiff to prove, first, a mandate from the defendant to act for him in the several transactions which the plaintiff claims to have carried out on his behalf; and, secondly, the due execution of that mandate.\nArticles 1233 and 1235 of the Civil Code, which are both in section III. of ch. 9, are, so far as is material, as follows:\u2014\n1233. Proof may be made by testimony\u2014\n(1) Of all facts concerning commercial matters.\n(7) In cases in which there is a commencement of proof in writing. In all other matters proof must be made by writing or by oath of the adverse party.\nThe whole, nevertheless, subject to the exceptions and limitations specially declared in this section and to the provisions contained in article 1690.\n1235. In commercial matters * * * no action or exception can be maintained against any party or his respresentatives unless there is a writing signed by the former, in the following cases\u2014\n(4) Upon any contract for the sale of goods unless the buyer has accepted or received part of the goods or given something in earnest to bind the bargain.\nAs stated by the learned Chief Justice, delivering the judgment appealed from, it has been held by the courts of the Province of Quebec in similar cases that though the broker's authority may be proved by verbal testimony, yet article 1235 C.C. requires the purchase made thereunder to be proved by writing. I must with reluctance dissent from the latter of these propositions. The Chief Justice quotes the late Judge Cross saying in the case of Trenholme v. McLennan[3] :\nThe plaintiff as a broker could by written contract, made out and evidenced by his own signature, bind two parties to a sale made by the one to the other through him, but when he attempts to bind one of the parties to himself, he requires, besides the verbal testimony as to his instructions, written evidence to establish the purchase, and this he cannot make for himself as against the party who instructed him to effect the purchase.\nArticle 1235 C.C. does not, however, say that there must be written evidence to establish the purchase; it says no action can be maintained against any party upon any contract for the sale of goods unless there is a writing signed by him. Now what writing can it be suggested the respondent could have given in a case like the present? No writing by him could be required for the purpose of the purchase which he had authorized the broker to make. Article 1235 C.C. is really only effective when the relations between the parties are those of seller and buyer and there is here no dispute between such; it is a question between principal and agent. Again I think it is necessary to distinguish between proving the purchase and proving the contract for sale; article 1235 C.C. is referring to executory not executed contracts such as are here in question.\nI am assuming that the facts are as above stated and I desire to add that this judgment applies only in such cases. I say this because, though I have not gone at any length into the facts of the case, yet I see that in paragraph 22 of the amended declaration it is alleged that on the arrival of a quantity of oats at Montreal \"the defendant failed to take delivery and to pay therefor.\" Any case in which the respondent is sued as a purchaser for failure to carry out his contract is governed by article 1235 C.C. and is not within this judgment.\nSubject to this reservation I am of opinion that it was competent to the plaintiff appellant to give oral evidence under the provisions of article 1233 C.C. The appeal must be allowed and the action referred back for further hearing and decision.\nDavies J.\u2014I concur in the opinion stated by the Chief Justice.\nIdington J.\u2014In an action like this by a broker for services rendered to a client in buying and selling grain for him I do not think the article 1235 C.C. must necessarily have any application.\nThe action is not within the express language of the article. It relates to executed or alleged executed contracts wherein the delivery not only of the part, but of the whole has taken place within the meaning of what such parties as these concerned herein attach to the word. It is not suggested that there had been any failure of respondent to reap what he bargained for by reason of any default on the part of the appellant to procure the contracts or any of them in writing. I can conceive of a broker in failing to get for his client a written contract thereby leading him to make a loss. In such a case the question might come up under article 1235 C.C.\nThere seems nothing of that sort in the alleged transactions in question. They have all been fully executed or their existence denied.\nThere is nothing illegal in carrying on business by means of mere oral bargains. People may be foolish in not reducing their contract to writing but the contract once executed it matters not in the commercial world whether in fact reduced to writing or not.\nI think the appeal must be allowed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014With very great respect I am of the opinion that there has been in this case a misconception of the purview and effect of article 1235 (4) C.C. which reads as follows:\u2014\n1235. In commercial matters in which the sum of money or value in question exceeds fifty dollars, no action or exception can be maintained against any party or his representatives unless there is a writing signed by the former, in the following cases:\u2014\n4. Upon any contract for the sale of goods, unless the buyer has accepted or received part of the goods or given something in earnest to bind the bargain.\nIt should be noted that although this provision deals with contracts for the sale of goods it is in the form of the fourth section of the English Statute of Frauds (\"no action should be brought etc.\") rather than in that of the old 17th section (\"no contract shall be good\"). The difference in effect between these two provisions is illustrated in the well-known case of Leroux v. Brown[4]. An action such as this to recover an agent's commission and outlay on sales and purchases of goods is not, in my opinion, an action upon the contracts for the sales or purchases and therefore is not within clause 4 of article 1235 C.C. Moreover, while it might be a defence to such an action that the contracts made by the agent on behalf of his principal were unenforceable because not provable under article 1235 and that the agent had, therefore, not earned his commission, and was not entitled to re-imbursement of his outlay, no such question can arise in the case of executed contracts such as we are dealing with. Indeed, in an action upon the contract itself, where it has been executed, the statute will not afford a defence. Green v. Saddington[5]; Seaman v. Price[6]; Addison on Contracts (11 ed.), p. 26; 4 Amer. & Eng. Encycl., p. 982. I am unable to distinguish the decision of the Court of Queen's Bench in Trenholme v. McLennan[7], and I am, with great respect, of the opinion that it must be overruled.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs.\nBrodeur J.\u2014The appellants are brokers and members of the Montreal Corn Exchange and they claim from the respondent a sum of nearly $25,000 for the difference between the purchase and the sale price of oats made by them on behalf of the respondent.\nThe only question at issue before this court is the admissibility of parol evidence.\nThe trial judge decided that the transactions could not, on the authority of article 1235 of the Civil Code and of a judgment rendered by the Court of Queen's Bench in the case of Trenholme v. McLennan7, be proved. That decision of the trial judge was confirmed by the Court of King's Bench, Justices Trenholme and Cross dissenting.\nThe appellant claims that the relations of the parties are those of principal and agent and not of vendor and purchaser, that the Statute of Frauds does not apply and that the question of admissibility of evidence is ruled by the provisions of article 1233 of the Civil Code.\nThere is no divergence of opinion between the parties as to the evidence of the contract of agency. They all admit that the plaintiff could prove by oral testimony the contract by which he was commissioned to buy and sell the goods in question. Forget v. Baxter[8], is authority for the proposition that the transactions by a broker in respect of sales and purchases of shares are\ncommercial matters within article 1233 of the Civil Code and might be established by parol evidence.\nIn the case of Trenholme v. McLennan[9], so much relied on by the respondent, the same proposition was also declared.\nThere is then no question as to the right of the plaintiff to prove by oral evidence his contract of agency.\nBut it is contended that if the transactions of the agent cover sales of goods, then a written contract or a memorandum as required by article 1235 (4) of the Civil Code, or the Statute of Frauds, is required.\nI must say, in the first place, that the relations of the parties are not those of vendor and purchaser, but those of principal and agent.\nIt is not alleged in the action that the plaintiff sold goods to the defendant, but that the plaintiff in execution of his mandate bought and sold goods on behalf of the respondent. If the plaintiff can prove by witnesses that he was duly authorized or instructed by the defendant to purchase and sell oats, it seems to me that he has established all the facts which are necessary for the existence of their contractual relations. I do not see how it is possible to separate those relations.\nThe Statute of Frauds and the provisions of article 1235 (4) C.C. provide that in commercial matters no action can be maintained unless there, is a writing signed by the defendant upon any contract for the sale of goods. It has reference to actions taken by the vendor against the purchaser, but it has no reference to instructions or mandate given by a person to purchase goods.\nIt is a well established rule of law that authority for an agent to sign a memorandum need not be given in writing. It may be given in any way in which an authority is conferred by law on an agent. It has been decided in England in the case of Rochefoucald v. Boustead[10], that an agent to whom land purchased on behalf of his principal has been conveyed will not be permitted to plead the statute against the principal for whom he is trustee and the latter may give parol evidence of the trust.\nApplying that decision to the facts in this case, it shews that Schmidt could by parol evidence establish that those sales of goods were made on his behalf. If he can prove that himself by parol evidence, why should not the plaintiff have the same power?\nI have given much consideration to the case of Trenholme v. McLennan[11], and especially to that part of the judgment where it is stated that the plaintiff as a broker could by a written contract made out and evidenced by his own signature bind two parties to a sale made by the one to the other through him, but when he attempts to bind one of the parties to himself, he requires, besides the verbal testimony as to his instructions, written evidence to establish the purchase and this he cannot make for himself as against the parties who instructed him to effect the purchase.\nWhat are the instructions which the broker received and which he has proved? It was to buy and sell goods for the principal. That was the contract alleged; that was a contract proved, and I do not see how those instructions can be disjoined as it has been done in that case of Trenholme v. McLennan[12].\nI may add that this question has also come up before the courts in the United States and they have invariably decided with one exception that oral evidence could be made of the mandate alleged by the broker.

The motion to quash the appeal was based on allegations that no money condemnation was asked for by the plaintiff's action except as to cost of a notarial protest, that neither the title to the land nor any future rights therein were in question, and that the entry shewn upon the certificate of the registrar of deeds relating to encumbrances on the land had no reference to a claim due either by the plaintiff or to the defendants, but the amount thereby secured appeared to be due to third persons who were not parties to the action and whose claim could not be affected thereby.\nC.

As the river in question for several miles from its mouth upwards to a point where its course is obstructed by rapids is in fact capable of being utilized for the purposes of navigation the bed of the stream for that distance forms part of the Crown domain. (Art. 400 C.C.)\nWithout express terms to that effect a Crown grant, made in 1806, of township lands in the territory now comprised in the Province of Quebec did not pass title to the grantee in the bed of navigable waters within the area described in the letters patent of grant. Idington J. dissented on the ground that the language of the letters patent in question was intended and was sufficiently explicit and comprehensive to convey to the grantee the bed of the navigable waters included within the limits of the description of the lands granted.\nThe judgment appealed from (15 Ex. C.R. 189), was affirmed, Idington J. dissenting. APPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], dismissing the suppliants' petition of right with costs.\nThe circumstances of the case are stated in the judgments now reported.\nThe arguments on the appeal were heard on the 25th and 26th of May, 1915, and judgment was reserved On the 17th of June, 1915, the Attorney-General for the Province of Quebec applied to the Supreme Court of Canada for leave to intervene in the appeal and to be heard as a party asserting a claim to the lands in question; permission was granted for the filing of the intervention and the appeal was subsequently re-heard on the issues therein raised. By the judgment now reported it was considered that, as the intervenant, in the factum filed on the intervention, had asked that the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada should be affirmed and the appeal dismissed it was unnecessary to determine, on this appeal, the respective rights in the lands of the Province of Quebec and of the Dominion of Canada. The appeal was dismissed with costs and it was ordered that there should be no costs allowed to any party on the intervention.\nAylen K.C. for the appellants cited Maclaren v.

Weymss[16], at page 66, and Gann.v. Free Fishers of Whitstable[17].\nThe bed of the Gatineau River, wherever navigable or floatable, is vested in the King in the right of the Province of Quebec, with the exception only of those portions thereof which, by virtue of the provisions of the \"B.N.A. Act, 1867,\" may have become vested in the Dominion of Canada. We refer to the Quebec statute 6 Geo. V., ch. 17, inserting the following in the Revised Statutes of Quebec, 1909, after article 1524.\u2014\"1524 (a). Whatever may have been the system of Government in force, the authority which in the past has had the control and administration of public lands in the territory now forming the Province of Quebec or any part thereof, has always had the power to alienate or lease, to such extent as was deemed advisable, the beds and banks of navigable rivers and lakes, the bed of the sea, the seashore and lands reclaimed from the sea, comprised within the said territory forming part of the public domain.\"\nThe intervenant submits that the evidence abundantly warrants the finding of the learned trial judge that that part of the Gatineau River which borders on lots 2 and 3 was at the date of the letters patent, and is now, navigable and floatable according to the law and jurisprudence on the question; and that the appellants have not established a title through Philemon Wright, assuming that the latter ever acquired any title thereto.\nAylen K.C. for the appellants\nChrysler K.C. for the respondent\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This is a petition of right brought by the appellants to have it declared that they are the owners, and as such entitled to the possession of the bed of the River Gatineau within the boundary lines of lots 2 and 3 in the 5th range of the Township of Hull in the Province of Quebec.\nThe petition was dismissed by Mr. Justice Audette on two grounds (a) that the River Gatineau at the point in question is navigable and was so at the time the grant relied on by the appellants was made; (b) that the bed of the river was not included in the grant.\nA river must surely be navigable if it is in fact navigated and I do not understand how it could be successfully contended that the River Gatineau is not, as it crosses the lots in question, \"navigable and floatable.\" The appellants do not seriously dispute the finding of the trial judge to that effect. In their factum here they boldly take this position:\u2014\nWhether the Gatineau River, in the locality of the lots in question, is navigable or unnavigable, floatable or unfloatable, the ownership of the bed passed by the grant to their \"auteur, \"Philemon Wright, and McBeanv. Carlisle[18], is referred to No one disputes or puts in question the point decided in that case. In Quebec a right of servitude in favour of the public undoubtedly exists for certain purposes over all streams, whether navigable or not. The question we have to decide, however, relates not to the use of the water, but to the ownership of the bed of the stream, and at once the distinction must be made between rivers which are navigable and those which are not. The beds of non-navigable and non-floatable streams are the property of the riparian owner ad filum aqu\u0153 (Maclaren v. Attorney-General for Quebec[19]), and pass with the grant of the ripa. On the other hand, from the very earliest days the courts of Quebec have held, and it is by the law of that province that this case must be decided, that the title to land which forms the bed of a navigable river can only be acquired by an express grant.\nBy French law the beds of all navigable rivers were deemed to be vested in the King as a public trust to subserve and protect the public right to use them as common highways for commerce. (Art. 400 C.C.) In France the King by virtue of his proprietary interests could grant the soil so that it should become private property, but his grant must be express (In re Provincial Fisheries[20], at page 527), and, in all cases, made subject to the paramount right of public use of the navigable waters which he could neither destroy nor abridge (Proudhon, \"Trait\u00e9 du Domaine Public,\" Vol. 3, No. 734). As under the French law the beds of navigable streams were vested in the King of France (Fisheries Case, 26 Can. S.C.R. 444), that title passed to the King of England by right of conquest. The laws of a conquered country remain in force unless and until they are altered and therefore the Crown now holds those lands upon the same trusts as before.\nSince Confederation the title to beds of navigable rivers has been vested in the Crown in right of the province but the authority to legislate regarding the public right of navigation is, by the \"British North America Act, 1867,\" assigned to the Dominion Parliament as coming within the subjects of trade and commerce and navigation which are among those enumerate in section 91 as within its exclusive authority.\nIn the United States courts it has been held that the power conferred upon the Federal Congress to regulate commerce extends not only to the control of the navigable waters of the country and the lands forming the beds thereof for the purposes of navigation, but also to authorizing the use of the beds of the streams for the purpose of erecting thereon piers, bridges and all other instrumentalities of commerce which, in the judgment of Congress, may be deemed necessary or convenient. The doctrine is very clearly stated in Stockton v. Baltimore and New York Railroad Co.[21].\nIt follows, therefore, that any legal title which might have become vested in a private individual must be subject to the same public trust and, therefore, subordinate to the rights of navigation and to the power of Parliament to control and use the soil in such navigable rivers, whenever the necessities of commerce and navigation demand. The right of Parliament to regulate trade and commerce and navigation remains unaffected by the question as to whether the soil of the shore submerged is in the Crown in the right of the province or in the owner of the shore.\nMr. Justice Brodeur refers to the opinion of Sir L. H. Lafontaine in the \"Seigniorial Case\" to the effect that the grant by the Crown of the bed of a navigable river must be made in express terms. It is not to my knowledge that the opinion so expressed has ever been doubted.\nThe letters patent in this case make no reference to a river, and the diagram attached to the grant has nothing to indicate that the Crown or the grantee had any knowledge of the fact that the River Gatineau crossed the lots in question. In these circumstances, the petition of right must fail on the short ground that the River Gatineau, being a navigable stream at the locus in question, was not included in the grant which is silent with respect to it. The appeal should be dismissed with costs and there will be no costs on the intervention.\nSee Pothier and Troplong as to d\u00e9faut de contenance.\nDavies J.\u2014The substantial questions raised upon this appeal were two: First, whether the appellants were entitled to a declaration as prayed that they were vested as proprietors with all those portions of the bed of the Gatineau River within the boundaries of lots 2 and 3 in the 5th range of the Township of Hull, Province of Quebec, as described in the Crown grant of 3rd January, 1806, whereby the Township of Hull was created.\nFor the purposes of this appeal, I assume the correctness of the findings of the trial judge that the suppliants had all the right, title and interest in the lots in question possessed by their original auteur, Philemon Wright, senior, under the said grant.\nThe second question, necessary to the determination of the first, was whether or not the Gatineau River was a navigable one from its mouth to Ironsides, just above which the first rapids and falls obstructing navigation begin? It is within this part of the river that the plaintiffs' claim is made.\nIn my judgment, the evidence shews conclusively that the river was a navigable one as far back as the memory of living witnesses went and was largely used as such by the great lumbering firm of Gilmour & Co. for about fifty or sixty years or more. The distance from its mouth to Ironsides is some four or five miles. The evidence places that fact of navigability beyond reasonable doubt.\nThen comes the question \u2014if that portion of the river in question, which embraces the locus in dispute, was navigable when the grant passed, did or could the grant operate to convey a title to the grantee in the river bed?\nThe boundaries of the Crown grant are general but no doubt cover and embrace this river bed and if such a grant could legally convey that part of the navigable four or five miles of the river to the grantee, as claimed, it no doubt did so.\nFinding, as I do, however, the river from its mouth up to the rapids to have been a navigable one, I reach the conclusion that such navigable portion of it was not and could not be conveyed by the grant.\nIf the bed of such portion of the river as was navigable was intended to be conveyed express words to that effect would be necessary to be used, assuming the bed of a navigable river could be conveyed at all by the Crown without legislative authority. In the case of the grant before us no such express words are used nor is the river referred to at all in the grant or shewn at all upon the plan to which the description refers. It is conceded that no legislative authority for the grant existed. The contention of the suppliant is, however, that without express words and in the absence of legislative authority the Crown could by such general words as are used in the grant pass the title in the bed of a navigable river flowing through the lands granted.\nIt is the civil law and not the common law which governs in this case and the test of navigability is not a tidal but a practical one, namely\u2014as a fact, is the river at the locus in dispute a navigable one? And, as I have held, its navigability for all practical purposes is unquestionable for four or five miles up from its mouth.\nI cannot but think that this action was brought by the suppliants on a misunderstanding of the decision of the Privy Council in the case of Maclaren v. The Attorney-General of Quebec[22].\nThat case merely decided (1) that the general descriptions of the townships there in question, being bounded by the river, were not varied by the references to the posts and stone boundaries in the detailed descriptions (2) that the River Gatineau being one down which only loose logs could be floated was not a part of the Crown domain within article 400 of the Civil Code and that the appellant's lands on either side of the river extended ad medium filum aqu\u0153.\nMr. Aylen attempted to apply the second finding of the Judicial Committee not only to the locus there in dispute but to the entire length of the river including the navigable part of it below Ironsides which embraces the locus in dispute in this appeal.\nThe river beyond Ironsides, in its upper reaches, may not be navigable but one down which loose logs alone could be floated but, in my opinion, that fact and the legal consequences which flow from it cannot affect the four or five miles from its mouth to Ironsides the evidence with respect to which shewed conclusively that it was navigable for loaded barges, steamers and other kinds of river craft and was, as a fact, while the Gilmour lumbering company carried on their operations for a period covering fifty or sixty years, so navigated.\nThat portion of the river between its mouth and Ironsides is crossed by two bridges\u2014one is a drawbridge to pass vessels through and the other a bridge of the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. 80 feet high and under which vessels passed. The booms and river improvements, which consist of piers, 1 to 12, running up the river from its west to its east side in a slanting direction, passed to the Dominion Government under section 108 of the \"British North America Act, 1867.\" In the case of the Attorney-General of Quebec v. Fraser[23], this court, of which I was a member, held that the River Moisie, in the Province of Quebec, for four of five miles up from its mouth till it reached the \"falls,\" was a navigable river and, for that reason, a grant of lands bounded by the banks of that river did not convey to the grantee the bed of the river ad medium filum aqu\u0153. In a summary of our holdings in that case formulated at the end of the reasons for the judgment of the court, delivered by Girouard, J., we say:\u2014 That the legal effect of the language of the patent with respect to the bed of the river, and the fishing rights therein, depends upon the determination of the question whether the Moisie at and in the four or five of its miles covered by the patent is navigable or floatable within the meaning of the law of Quebec, and that, adopting the test of navigability laid down by the Privy Council and hereinbefore quoted, we concur with the findings of the trial judge, and which findings are not questioned in the judgment of the court of appeal, that such river at such locality and from thence to its mouth, is so navigable and floatable.\nThat judgment was subsequently appealed to the Judicial Committee, sub nomine Wyatt v. Attorney-General of Quebec[24].\nIn their judgment, which affirmed the decision of this court, their Lordships approved of and incorporated in their reasons the summary of the judgment of this court including the part above quoted. The facts with respect to the navigability of the rivers Moisie and Gatineau a few miles up from their mouths and their non-navigability beyond that for nearly 200 miles are very similar and, in my opinion, the judgment of the Privy Council in Wyatt v. Attorney-General of Quebec24 is very much in point on the disputed question in this case if it is not conclusive.\nThe result of that is to hold that the navigability of some miles of a river from its mouth, which is found and held, and the legal consequences which flow from that finding cannot be affected by the fact that, higher up, the river becomes, by reason of falls and rapids, unnavigable and capable only of carrying floating logs.\nIn the reasons for the judgment of their Lordships of the Privy Council in the Maclaren Case[25] delivered by Lord Moulton, his Lordship was most careful to define exactly what was being decided. He says, at page 274 of that case:\u2014 But this is not all. The rights of the public in the River Gatineau are not in any way put in issue in this case. The parties to this appeal are substantially at one on the question of the private ownership of the bed of the River Gatineau. The only difference between them is as to which of two private owners possesses it. The appellants contend that the portion of the bed of the river which is in question passed to their predecessors in title, by the grants to Caleb Brooks in 1860 and 1865, and that to William Brooks in 1891. The respondent contends that it passed to the defendants under the grant to them in 1899. Neither party, therefore, sets up a title in the public. So far as the River Gatineau is concerned the decision of this case will do no more than decide whether or not the language of certain existing grants was sufficient, to pass particular portions of that bed, or whether, after such grants were made, they still remained in the hands of the Crown so that it had power to grant them by a later grant.\nNow it is attempted to apply some general observations made as to the River Gatineau being a navigable river or not to the entire river, including the locus near its mouth.\nIt does not seem to me that there was any intention on the part of the Judicial Committee to lay down any such rule as that contended for or to overrule or in any way call in question the previous decision of their Lordships with respect to the Moisie River being navigable for four or five miles from its mouth while above that, for nearly 180 miles, navigation was stopped by the falls and rapids of the river.\nLord Moulton, after saying that speaking generally no substantial help is obtained by the decided cases in Quebec as to navigable and floatable rivers until the appointment of the Seigniorial Commissioners under the Act of 1854 to settle the value of the Seigniorial rights which were then about to be abolished, says that the decisions of those Commissioners were\nof the highest authority as to the law then prevailing in Lower Canada\nto which an almost authoritative sanction has been given by statute. He further says:\u2014\nTurning to these seigniorial decisions and the judgments of the individual judges which accompany them, one cannot find any specific reference to the status of the beds of rivers which were only \"flottables \u00e0 b\u00fbches perdues.\" But, on the other hand, one finds clear statements that the seigniors became by their grant proprietors of the non-navigable rivers which passed through the fief subject to legal servitudes and to the ad medium filum rule.\nHis Lordship held that these decisions and the subsequent case of Boswell v. Denis[26],\njustified their Lordships in regarding the answers to the seigniorial questions as meaning that rivers were not floatable in the legal sense of that term if they were only so \u00e0 b\u00fbches perdues,\nand that their Lordships approved of the decision of this court in Tanguay v. Canadian Electric Light Co.[27], where the precise point was so decided.\nFor the purposes of this case I conclude that the decisions on the seigniorial questions referred to by Lord. Moulton with commendation and approval decided the law in Quebec to be that grants from the Crown did not without express words in them pass the beds of navigable rivers to grantees. In such a case as the grant before us purporting to convey certain lots of the Township of Hull through which the River Gatineau flowed and in which grant no reference at all was made to the river, the bed of the river for the four or five miles from its mouth where the river was navigable did not in my judgment pass to the grantee.\nA third question was raised whether the possession of the Crown for so long a period as that proved, evidenced by the construction and maintenance of the twelve blocks or piers built upon the bed of the river and connected together by logs or booms, did not bar the plaintiffs' claim. In my opinion it did.\nRe-stated shortly, my opinion is that a river such as the Gatineau, nearly 180 miles in length, may be in fact and in law navigable for miles from its mouth and until the falls or rapids are reached which prevent further navigation while it may not be navigable above those obstructions.\nThat in the case of Attorney-General of Quebec v. Fraser[28] the point Was so decided, and on appeal to the Privy Council was affirmed, and that by virtue of the civil law of Quebec in order to pass the bed of a navigable river from the Crown to the grantee express words and statutory authority must be shewn.\nLastly, the plaintiffs' claim in this case is barred by the Crown's possession of the bed of the river as proved by the evidence.\nThe appeal, therefore, should be dismissed with costs but no costs on the intervention.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014The appellants by petition of right sought to have it declared that under and by virtue of a grant on 3rd January, 1806, from the Crown to one Philemon Wright, of lots 2 and 3 in the 5th range of the Township of Hull, in what is now the Province of Quebec, he acquired the bed of the Gatineau River so far as running through the said lots as part of said grant, and that they by a series of transfers by way of conveyance, devise and inheritance, have acquired same. They claimed that respondent had taken and withheld same, or parts thereof, by means of structures erected in the river and booms so connected therewith for the purpose of retaining in store, temporarily or for long periods, logs, rafts and other material; and by the operation of the various devices in question has deprived them of sand and gravel of great value, and otherwise of the profits derivable from the ownership of said property. The respondent admitted the letters patent in question issued on said date, but denied apparently everything else and put appellants to the proof and further alleged that the Gatineau River where it flows through said two lots is and has always been a public navigable river and that the soil and bed of the said river is the property of respondent and not of appellant.\nThe learned trial judge suggested that the title to relief should be first tried and if any legal damages suffered, then a reference should be directed to determine the measure thereof.\nHe found the appellants had in fact acquired whatever title the original grantee had in said lots but in law he held that the grant in question did not pass any title to the bed of the stream.\nThe correctness of this latter holding must turn first upon the power of the Crown to make the grant and next upon whether in law the terms used therein are sufficiently clear to carry in them the intention to convey the bed of the stream free from any public right such as of navigation.\nThe power of the Crown so to grant must turn upon the nature of its title to such waste domains which it became seized of by statute or otherwise as result of the cession of 1759, and be subject to such restrictions, if any, as existed at the time in question.\nI should feel reluctant to cast a possible doubt upon titles dependent upon the grants of the Crown by holding that the prerogative had been so limited in the scope of its authority by reason of what French law or custom may be found to have imposed upon the prerogative of the French Crown.\nIn so far as anything in question herein may depend upon the royal prerogative, the measure thereof I take it must be that recognized by English law as determining the same and, in the language of Lord Watson in the case of Liquidators of the Maritime Bank of Canada v. Receiver-General of New Brunswick[29], at page 441,\nthe prerogative of the Queen, when it has not been expressly limited by local law or statute, is as extensive in Her Majesty's colonial possessions as in Great Britain.\nI may in adopting this opinion be permitted to add that I incline to think there are cases in which the prerogative may extend further in some colonies than it now may in England.\nIn some colonies the limitations imposed by statute, applicable to England or Great Britain only, may not be suitable to local colonial conditions even if English law so far as suitable thereto may have been introduced.\nIn measuring the rights acquired in Quebec before the cession from the French Crown, article 400 of the Code may be of value so far as respects the law of that earlier period.\nIn such cases whatever impliedly failed by French law to pass to the grantee must be presumed to have been preserved to the Crown and to have passed to the English Crown. In that sense the opinion of the learned judges of the Seigniorial Court must be always held of great value relative thereto.\nWhat, however, we now have to deal with is of an entirely different nature. It arises out of the grant by the English Crown of part of the waste lands of the Crown, in Quebec, in 1806\u2014sixty years before the Civil Code was enacted.\nThe result mayor may not differ from a fair consideration of what might have been the effect of a similar grant if made by the French Crown before the cession. It conduces, however, to a clear conception of what we have to deal with herein to bear in mind that it is English and not French law which we have to consider and that article 400 C.C., so much relied upon, cannot help us herein.\nTo prevent misapprehension it may be observed that from the time article 400 C.C. came into force, in 1866, as part of the Civil Code, the Crown having assented thereto may be possibly bound thereby as to subsequent grants unless so far as expressly or impliedly modified by later legislation. I express no opinion upon that. All I am concerned with just now is to eliminate what to my mind is obvious error leading to confusion on a subject where there is so much apt to confuse, even when we have eliminated all that we possibly can which tends to mislead. And I may here observe that in the numerous cases I have referred to in the course of this inquiry, the only formally expressed reason I have found advanced for applying the test of French law in this regard is that assigned by the late Mr. Justice Gwynne in the case of Dixson v. Snetsinger[30], at page 242, when he quotes and relied upon 14 Geo. III. whereby it was enacted\nthat in all matters of controversy relative to property and civil rights resort shall be had to the laws of Canada as the rule for the decision of the same.\nI fail to see how that provision for the decision of rights in controversy between subject and subject relative to questions touching their property and civil rights can touch or measure the prerogative rights of the Crown relative to the Crown domain. It is elementary that unless the Crown is reached by express words or necessary implication in any statute its rights or prerogatives are not affected thereby.\nThere is no such expression in the statute in question. Indeed there is much in the statute forbidding such implication, to say nothing of section 9 which provides that section 8 which confers said right shall not be extended to any lands that had been granted or should thereafter be granted by His Majesty to be held in free and common soccage.\nI am not concerned with the outcome thereof. It might well be that where lands \"were granted and any dispute arose relative to them between subjects of the Crown their rights might be determined by French or other law, yet the rights of the Crown to deal with that ungranted would not be affected by any such rule.\nI do not quarrel with the result of the decision in Dixson v. Snetsinger[31], which seems to have been rightly decided.\nThe rebuttable presumption of law which gives the riparian grantee of lands ad filum aqu\u0153 as his boundary might well be held in reason and common sense rebutted when such a claim is confronted by the facts involved when attempted to be applied to such a river as the St. Lawrence.\nFortunately we need not pursue that inquiry. The exigencies of this case are not such as to call therefor.\nIt is the range of possible activity of the English Crown in law over the waste lands thereof in an English colony which we have to deal with and whether or not the limits thereof are to be taken from what we find in relation thereto governing its action in England in regard to inland rivers, does not seem to me to make any practical difference for the purposes of this case.\nThe Gatineau River is far from tidal waters. The limitations upon the powers of the Crown in regard to tidal waters may therefore at once be eliminated from our consideration.\nI think the law upon the subject may be accepted as expressed in Coulson & Forbes on the Law of Waters, at page 515 (3rd ed.), as follows:\u2014\nThe public right of navigation may exist in non-tidal as well as in tidal waters; and where it does so exist, the principles of law which have been stated with regard to tidal waters will equally apply.\nBut in the case of non-tidal rivers, the right of passage does not exist as a public franchise paramount to all rights of property in the bed, but can only be acquired by prescription, founded on a presumed grant from the owners of the soil over which the water passes. It would not, therefore, appear to extend prim\u00e2 facie to a right of passage over the whole of the navigable channel, as in the case of tidal rivers, but to be strictly limited to the extent of the right granted or user proved.\nI assume that the law is thus correctly stated and hence a grant of the soil as well as right to fish might have been made by the Crown if possessed thereof in an inland river though navigable. Such I take it are the implications in the foregoing statement just quoted.\nThe doctrine laid down in the cases of Malcomson v. O'Dea[32], and Gann v. The Free Fishers of Whitstable[33], and many other cases seem to indicate that the Crown before Magna Charta had the power even in the case of tidal navigable waters to make a grant of the soil, but since the development of what is contained therein rather than what is expressed, the Crown cannot now in England make such a grant of soil in such river as will exclude the public or create a several fishery.\nThis suggests the inquiry of whether or not the like limitations bind the Crown in the colonies. If the prerogative of the Crown in such cases is to be measured by that existent anterior to Magna Charta, assuredly there cloud be no doubt of the power to make a grant of the soil in any tidal navigable river and thereby exclude the public and hence much more so relative to inland navigable rivers or other waters.\nIt may well be observed that the historical side of the question as exemplified in, the grants made in the early history of the English colonies in America may warrant us in saying that much wider powers than might be tolerated in England, if conceivable of exercise there, have been presumably duly exercised in colonies.\nThough this case has been argued twice I have been unable to tempt counsel to help us in relation to the line of inquiry I thus suggest.\nI presume counsel in so refraining have been well advised for the two-fold reasons, first that royal prerogative in these later and degenerate days, cannot be imagined to have possessed, even a long time ago, such powers (so repugnant to modern thought) as to render the resting of a claim thereon advisable; and next, that in any case it is the sand and gravel which would go with a rightful grant of the soil that appellants claim and possibly they attach little importance to the right thereto being subject to the public's reasonable rights of navigation. I therefore express no definite opinion on that aspect of the case.\nThe Crown certainly owned this soil in question and this river a hundred and ten years ago, and could within the law as laid down in the cases of Murphy v. Ryan[34], followed by Pearce v. Scotcher[35]; Tilbury v. Silva[36], without any great stretch of its prerogative grant both soil and river and let the public find its own way of reclaiming any uses thereon or thereof as they best might.\nThe case of Hurdman v. Thompson[37], and other like cases also support the appellants' contention relative to the power of the Crown to convey the soil in the bed of a navigable river. As they do not bind us I have tried to test the question by the application of general principles which should prevail.\nThe process adopted for disposing of this part of the wilderness to induce settlement thereof is outlined in the recitals in the grant. And in the instructions to Lord Dorchester, as Governor-General in 1791, some fifteen years before the grant in question both the learned trial judge and counsel arguing here seem to find the only guide to the meaning of said recitals.\nI should much have preferred to have seen the instructions to Bouchette, the Surveyor-General, and the reports of the surveyors to him, accompanied as they doubtless were with their field notes, and default those illuminating records should have been glad to have had some reasonable explanation for their non-production.\nHad such and the like information relative to the instructions to the Governor-General and Lieutenant-Governor, for the time being, been forthcoming or accounted for, we could probably approach the use of the fifteen-year old instructions to Lord Dorchester and use same with more confidence, than we can in the absence thereof, that the inferences to be drawn therefrom are resting upon a sure foundation.\nWith such doubt and hesitation as must exist under such circumstances I assume that the instruction to Lord Dorchester and the terms of his commission give us at least a fair indication of the policy of the advisors of the Crown at that time and in all probability it continued for some years unchanged especially as the appointment of Lord Dorchester was coeval with the new departure in the Government of Canada.\nThe commission to Lord Dorchester contained direct authority for making grants of such kind as in question herein in the following terms:\u2014\nAnd we do likewise give and grant to you full power and authority with the advice of our Executive Councils for the affairs of our said Provinces of Upper Canada and Lower Canada to grant lands within the said provinces respectively which said grants are to pass and be sealed with our Seal of such Province and being entered upon record by such officer or officers as shall be appointed thereunto shall be good and effectual in law against us Our Heirs and Successors: Provided nevertheless that no grants or leases of any of the trading ports in our said provinces shall under colour of this authority be made to any person or persons, whatsoever until our pleasure therein shall be signified to you.\nThis was accompanied by instructions relative to the execution of this power as follows:\u2014\nIt is therefore Our Will and Pleasure, that all and every person and persons, who shall apply for any grant or grants of land, shall previous to their obtaining the same, make it appear that they are in a condition to cultivate and improve the same, and in case you shall, upon a consideration of the circumstances of the person or persons applying for such grants, think it advisable to pass the same, you are in such case to cause a warrant to be drawn up directed to the Surveyor-General or other officers empowering him or them to make a faithful and exact survey of the lands so petitioned for, and to return the said warrant within six months at farthest from the date thereof, with a plot or description of the lands so surveyed thereunto annexed, and when the warrant shall be so returned by the said surveyor, or other proper officer, the grant shall be made out in due form, and the terms and conditions required by these Our Instructions be particularly and expressly mentioned therein\u2014and it is Our Will and Pleasure that the said grants shall be registered within six months from the date thereof in the Registrar's office, and a docket thereof be also entered in Our Auditor's Office, copies of all of which entries shall be returned regularly by the proper officer to Our Commissioners of Our Treasury.\n32. And for the further encouragement of Our Subjects, It is Our Will and Pleasure that the lands to be granted by you as aforesaid, shall be laid out in townships, and that each inland township shall, as nearly as Circumstances shall admit, consist of ten miles square; and such as shall be situated upon a navigable river or water shall have a front of nine miles, and be twelve miles in depth, and shall be subdivided in such manner as may be found most advisable for the accommodation of the settlers, and for making the several reservations for public uses and particularly for the support of the protestant clergy agreeably to the above recited Act passed in the present Year of Our Reign.\n* * * * *\nThat no farm lot shall be granted to any one person being master or mistress of a family in any township so to be laid out, which shall contain more than 200 Acres.\nIt is our Will and Pleasure, and you are hereby allowed or permitted to grant unto every such person or persons such further quantity of land as they may desire, not exceeding one thousand acres over and above what may have heretofore been granted to them, and in all grants of land to be made by you as aforesaid, you are to take care that due regard be had to the quality and comparative value of the different parts of land comprised within any township, so that each grantee may have as nearly as may be a proportionable quantity of lands of such different quality and comparative value, as likewise that the breadth of each tract of land to be hereafter granted be one-third of the length of such tract, and that the length of such tract do not extend along the banks of any river, but into the main land, that thereby the said grantees may have each a convenient share of what accommodation the said river may afford for navigation or otherwise.\nAnd illustrative of the spirit in which these instructions were conceived we find item 61 thereof deals with the Bay of Chaleurs, as follows:\u2014\n61. Whereas it will be for the general benefit of our subjects carrying on the fishery in the Bay of Chaleurs in Our Province of Lower Canada, that such part of the beach and shore of the said bay as is ungranted, should be reserved to Us, Our Heirs, and Successors, it is therefore Our Will and Pleasure that you do not in future direct any survey to be made or grant to be passed for any part of the ungraanted beach or shore of the said Bay of Chaleurs, except such parts thereof as by Our Orders in Council dated the 29th of June and 21st of July, 1786, are directed to be granted to John Shoolbred of London, merchant, and to Mess'rs. Robin, Pipon and Company of the Island of Jersey, mer- chants, but that the same be reserved to Us, Our Heirs and Successors, together with a sufficient quantity of wood land adjoining thereto, necessary for the purpose of carrying on the fishery.\nIt certainly never was supposed than that the parts of unexplored and unknown rivers or margins of the sea should be put beyond the power of the local executive to grant same when deemed advisable.\nLet is now apply the terms of the said commission and instructions to the dealing with the lands in question.\nThe survey made the lots in question run somewhat obliquely across the Gatineau River. So much so does this appear that whilst the instructions are followed literally by making the lots in the survey run at right angles to the Ottawa River, known to be navigable, no such attempt was made in that regard relative to the lands through which the Gatineau River ran.\nWhat is the correct inference to be drawn from such a mode of treatment thereof? Is it not as plain as if we saw the surveyors doing the work that they, no doubt well instructed on the point, had arrived at the conclusion that the Gatineau River, as they found it, was not a navigable river and hence could not be treated as such.\nMoreover, we must recall to mind what the conditions were relative to navigation a hundred and ten years ago when the powers of steam were unknown and nothing but the uses of the oar, or the pole, or the wind were available to navigate, any river. When we see tugs operated by the use of steam or gasoline hauling vast loads of timber, or anything else floatable, we are apt to forget that this was not always so; and jump to the conclusion that streams which thereby can be made available for navigation and might now make valuable navigable waters, could not, so long ago, be looked upon, or held to be, absolutely worthless for any such purpose; as they in fact were according to the means of navigation then known.\nAgain we must realize that the condition of the Gatineau at its mouth and for some miles back therefrom over the plain through which it runs may have been entirely different when the Township of Hull was surveyed, from what it seems now, or may have seemed sixty years ago, when steps were taken to improve and render it navigable, for even the limited navigable uses it has been put to.\nWe must, so far as we can, with the very limited information given us, try to realize what those engaged in the survey found confronting them; and I think we must attribute to them at least an honest purpose to discharge their duty.\nThat discharge of duty we find portrayed in the plans before us which assuredly indicate an intention to measure out in rectangular lots of the dimensions indicated in the instructions that space in the wilderness occupied by either land or water or both, regardless of the possibilities of the developments of the waters for purposes of navigation.\nTo quote the language of the Judicial Committee in the recent case of Maclaren v. The Attorney-General of Quebec[38], at page 275, when dealing with this river and having to consider the title as to the bed thereof at a point where the townships and land on either side of the river had been bounded by iron posts placed in the bank thereof; the judgment stated:\u2014\nThe plots in those townships (meaning the Townships of Hull and Wakefield) are rectangular, so that in the case of river lots the bed of the river is included within the metes and bounds of the lots in question without any appeal to the doctrine of ad medium filum aqu\u0153.\nThat is not a decision of the court on the point involved herein but it is of great value as indicating how this survey and these plans thereof as presented to the minds of their Lordships led them to view the matter and conclude what was the nature thereof.\nIt is, I submit, reasonable to presume that the Governor-General of the time, or his Lieutenant-Governor did not discard their instructions and that the Surveyor-General for the province properly instructed his deputy surveyors and duly received reports from them of their work duly accompanied by their field notes, and duly considered same; and acted properly in adopting the survey and directing the patents to issue upon which appellants now rely.\nIt requires more assurance than I possess to overrule their judgment reached upon a knowledge of the facts no one can now ever possess, and condemn their conduct of the business they had in hand.\nWith great respect I submit the language of the patent read in light of the plans and instructions can convey no other meaning than the plain reading thereof.\nThere is nothing that can be found in the history of the prerogative of the Crown which would render it either necessary or proper to read into such a language a condition relative to future possible uses of the waters in question for purposes of navigation.\nWe might almost as well try to read into the patents of those holding grants of land from the Crown a reservation in favour of railways to be constructed by the Crown because we now find such might have been a prudent exercise of the power of the Crown in making such a grant. Although we are far from having presented to us all that might have been so, relative to the condition of the Gatineau River before it was touched by the improving hands of those acting for the respondent, there is enough presented in the evidence to suggest that it may have shifted more than once its banks at the places in question long before any such improvements were made.\nThe accumulation of banks of sand and gravel which are in question and all that is implied therein ought to make one pause before positively reaching any conclusion in favour of navigability of the parts in question a hundred and ten years ago.\nWe have in truth nothing to guide us accurately unless we adopt the conclusion reached by those concerned in the survey and the outcome of the labour as exemplified in the patent and plans descriptive of the lots.\nWe do find those called to testify as to the navigability of the river telling us as follows: Noonan says :\u2014\nQ.\u2014Down to 18 years ago, or say in later days, we will call it, where was the channel? A.\u2014The place commenced to fill up.\nQ.\u2014On the west shore? A.\u2014On the west shore, and then we had to let them through on the other side. We let them through on the east side when the water was high; and when the water went down we let them through in the middle of the boom.\nQ.\u2014At high water, the place for passing boats through is where you describe between piers 9 and 10? A.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014If the water was low you used to let them through in the middle of the boom? A.\u2014Yes, at the third pier.\nQ.\u2014How long ago was it you let steamers through at the third pier? A.\u2014A long time.\nQ.\u2014In more recent years all have gone through at the trip? A.\u2014They got the dredge at the trip to make the channel deeper.\nQ.\u2014When was that dredging done? A.\u2014In 1874. They dredged twice.\nQ. Was the last time in 1874? A.\u2014I can't say. Fenton says:\u2014\nQ.\u2014The three inch plants would be rafted, and where would you raft to? A.\u2014We rafted it.\nQ.\u2014At the yard at Ironsides\u2014what sort of raft? A.\u2014The cribs were 24 feet, wide, and 72 feet long, and 12 tiers when the water was at its proper pitch. There were 12 tiers in each crib. The crib was 72 by 24 of 12 tiers of three inch planks.\nHis Lordship:\u2014What would that draw? A.\u2014I should say it would draw about 24 inches or a little more perhaps.\nAnd again:\u2014\nQ.\u2014Do you remember if the river was dredged at any time? A.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014When was it first dredged? A.\u2014I can't say. It was dredged while I still was at Ironsides.\nHe was employed at Gilmour's Mills from 1869 to 1890; and again:\u2014\nQ.\u2014What about the sandbars, were they there in your time? A.\u2014There were sandbars there.\nQ.\u2014But you can't say how they compared with those to-day? A.\u2014No.\nQ.\u2014You don't know the size of them? A.\u2014No.\nScott, an engineer of respondent, in 1889, says:\u2014\nQ.\u2014It shews Leamy's Lake? A.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014It shews the outlet of the Leamy Lake and the old canal and the new canal? A.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014Are the numbers on this plan for the piers? A.\u2014Yes.\nAnd again says:\u2014\nQ.\u2014And the boom is attached to the east bank of the Gatineau River, about three-quarters of a mile north of the C.P.R. Bridge? A.\u2014About that. The boom extends from the north of the new canal on the west side to about a quarter of a mile above the C.P.R. bridge on the east side.\nThe respondent, interested only in seeing justice done, should have been able to follow these hints, so as to enlighten us why and when such conditions existed and especially how the two feet of navigable water was obtained and whether or not it was the result of improvements to navigation? Or was the entrance only a few inches in depth before these changes? It should be held to be impossible by such evidence, unless clearly demonstrating that, the improvements had nothing to do with producing even that degree of navigability, to establish that the Crown had originally been improvident in its grant and thereby escape the consequences thereof.\nThe reservations of the minerals and of the right to use the waters on the lands in question for operating mines is indicative of what was thought of the waters at the time of the grant. No doubt that was a usual provision in every like grant. Yet it brought always home, to the minds of those acting, the nature of the waters referred to in each grant.\nI conclude from all the foregoing considerations not only that the grant of the lands in question was intended and properly intended to convey all that the Crown could grant by a conveyance of lots 2 and 3 in range 5 as it purports to, and that is all proprietory interests possible therein. Hence the respondent had no right without expropriation to interfere with the enjoyment of anything thereby presumably granted, any more than with the rights of grantees of low and marshy spots of land through which in the interests of navigation a canal might be projected and constructed.\nIn any event I am unable to understand in light of the authorities I have referred to, how it can be contended that the Crown had not by so plain a description comprehending the lands covered by the waters of the Gatineau as well as everything else within the assigned limits conveyed the soil over which the river runs even if subject to the right of the public for purposes of navigation.\nThe legislation of the last session of the Quebec Legislature would seem, if applicable to a pending suit, to have put an end to controversy on this head, but, holding the views I have expressed, I prefer resting thereon to seeking refuge in this legislation which may not have been intended to affect the present litigants.\nThen the assertion of such public right does not require or justify the uses of the river for purposes of storage of lumber or encumbering the soil with such timber as stranded there when the waters have subsided.\nWhether the soil under the piers erected by the respondent has by reason of such possession of the soil whereon they rest become by prescription that of respondent and that respondent is entitled to maintain that title thereto is by no means easy of a satisfactory solution.\nThe uses to which the piers were put from time to time could not establish at law any prescriptive title to maintain such an easement or servitude as needed to maintain the right to so use and enjoy them.\nAnd with the failure to assert such a right of user I think must fall the possible claims to the soil on which the piers rest.\nI see no good ground for questioning the title of appellants found as fact by the learned trial judge.\nThe appellants are entitled to the declarations prayed for and the other relief prayed for save in so far as the measure of the damages to determine which there must, if the parties cannot agree as to same, be a reference to find what may be due within the times not answered by the plea of prescription relative thereto so far as same be found on the facts applicable.\nThe appeal should therefore be allowed with costs throughout.\nAnglin J.\u2014Whatever may be their position in other provinces of Canada (see Keewatin Power Co. v. Town of Kenora[39],) in the Province of Quebec the beds of non-tidal rivers navigable or floatable in fact form part of the public domain (Art. 400 C.C.; Attorney-General of Quebec v. Fraser[40], at pages 593, 599), and do not pass to the grantee of lands bordering upon them, at all events unless expressly included in the grant in terms specific and unmistakable (Seigniorial Questions, Vol. A., pp. 68a, 130a, 374a; Vol. B., 50 (c); Maclaren v. Attorney-General for Quebec[41], at pages 273-8. As to the effect of decisions of the Seigniorial Court and their applicability to other than seigniorial lands, see the \"Seigniorial Act,\" 18 Vict. ch. 3, sec. 16, and Tanguay v. Canadian Electric Light Co.[42], at pages 12-13, 19; Maclaren v. Attorney-General of Quebec41, at pages 280-1.) Although non-floatable in some of its upper reaches and indeed throughout the greater part of its length (Maclaren v. Attorney-General for Quebec41, at pages 278-283), the Gatineau is admittedly navigable for several miles from the point at which it debouches into the River Ottawa. Notwithstanding that its general character is that of non-navigability, and however its navigable reaches above the first obstruction to navigation should be regarded (see Hurdman v. Thompson[43], at pages 437, 450, the converse case), the incidents of a navigable river attach to it up to that obstruction. The Queen v. Robertson[44]. The lands in question are within this navigable stretch of the river.\nHaving regard to the royal instructions referred to by Mr. Justice Audette (15 Ex. C.R. 189), to which it was expressly made subject and to the rule of construction \"in favour of the Crown pro bono publico and against grantees\" (Coulson and Forbes on Waters (3. ed.), p. 28), the grant to the appellants' predecessor in title of lots by number, although, as surveyed for the purpose of the erection of the Township of Hull, they extend across the river, was not, in my opinion, such an express grant of the river bed as would be necessary to carry title to it, assuming that it was alienable.\nI also incline to the view that, if it were necessary to invoke it, the Crown could maintain the title by prescription alternatively asserted on its behalf.\nBrodeur J.\u2014Avant la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration, le gouvernement canadien avait \u00e9rig\u00e9 pr\u00e8s de l'embouchure de la Rivi\u00e8re Gatineau des estacades (booms) pour y recueillir les billots qu'on descendait dans cette rivi\u00e8re. Depuis 1867, le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral a continu\u00e9 a maintenir ces estacades et une poursuite est maintenant dirig\u00e9e contre lui par les appelants, qui d\u00e9clarent que le lit de la Rivi\u00e8re Gatineau, \u00e0 cet endroit-l\u00e0, \u00e9tait leur propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nIls se pr\u00e9tendent subrog\u00e9s aux droits de Philemon Wright et ils alleguent qu'en vertu d'une concession faite par la Couronne \u00e0 ce dernier, le 14 janvier, 1806, il est devenu propri\u00e9taire de certains lots de terre que couvrait la rivi\u00e8re.\nDans une cause de Maclaren v.

Le Conseil Priv\u00e9 a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 cet endroit particulier il \u00e9tait \u00e9vident que la rivi\u00e8re n'\u00e9tait pas navigable et qu'en cons\u00e9quence les riverains, par leur contrat de concession, \u00e9taient devenus propri\u00e9taires du lit de la rivi\u00e8re.\nA l'endroit qui nous occupe dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, il est incontestable que la rivi\u00e8res est navigable.\nAlors la premi\u00e8re question qui se pr\u00e9sente est de savoir si une rivi\u00e8re peut \u00eatre navigable pour partie et \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une d\u00e9pendance du domaine public pour cette partie-l\u00e0 lorsque dans d'autres parties elle n'est pas navigable et est par cons\u00e9quent du domaine priv\u00e9.\nJe n'h\u00e9site pas \u00e0 dire avec les auteurs suivants que des rivi\u00e8res peuvent \u00eatre du domaine public pour partie.\nDaviel, Cours d'eau, p. 40, dit:\nLorsqu'une rivi\u00e8re n'est navigable ou flottable en trains qu'en certaines parties, toutes ces parties exclusivement doivent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme d\u00e9pendances du domaine public.\nDuranton, No. 203, dit:\u2014\nLes rivi\u00e8res navigables ou flottables ne sont telles que dans les parties o\u00f9 la navigation ou la flottaison peut avoir lieu; d\u00e8s lors elles ne font partie du domaine public que dans ces endroits et dans les autres les riverains peuvent les faire servir \u00e0 l'irrigation de leurs propri\u00e9t\u00e9s.\nGarnier, R\u00e9gime des Eaux, Vol. 1er, p. 56:\u2014\nLes lieux navigables et flottables font partie du domaine public et ceux qui ne le sont pas appartiennent aux particuliers sans \u00e9gard \u00e0 leur situation sur l'\u00e9tendue du cours d'eau.\nCette cour a d'ailleurs consacr\u00e9 le m\u00eame principe dans la cause de Attorney-General of Quebec v. Fraser[46]. Le jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 plus tard confirm\u00e9 par le Conseil\nPriv\u00e9[47], La Couronne avait-elle le droit, en 1806, de faire des concessions de terrain de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 y inclure des parties de rivi\u00e8res navigables?\nCette question aurait donn\u00e9 lieu a beaucoup d'\u00e9tude et de travail pour \u00eatre solutionn\u00e9e; mais depuis que la cause est pendante devant nous un statut provincial a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9 (6 Geo. V., ch. 17) qui d\u00e9clare positivement que la Couronne avait le droit de conc\u00e9der et d'ali\u00e9ner les lits des rivi\u00e8res navigables et flottables.\nPeut-on interpr\u00e9ter la concession du terrain qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite comme incluant la rivi\u00e8re elle-meme?\nLe Township de Hull avait \u00e9t\u00e9 divis\u00e9 en lots par un arpenteur; mais cette division, para\u00eet avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 faite sur le papier plut\u00f4t que sur le terrain lui-m\u00eame. On semble avoir pris l'\u00e9tendue du township et avoir trac\u00e9 sur papier divers lopins de terre sans y indiquer les cours d'eau, ni m\u00eame les rivi\u00e8res. Est-il \u00e0 pr\u00e9sumer que lorsque la concession a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite \u00e0 Philemon Wright, en 1806, la Couronne lui conc\u00e9dait en m\u00eame temps la Rivi\u00e8re Gatineau qui couvrait quelques-uns de ces lots, et notamment les lots en litige dans la pr\u00e9sente cause?\nChitty, On Prerogatives of the Crown, p. 391, dit:\u2014\nIn ordinary cases between subject and subject the principle is that the grant shall be construed, if the meaning be doubtful, most strongly against the grantor, who is presumed to use the most cautious words for his own advantage and security. But in the case of the King, whose grants chiefly flow from his royal bounty and grace, the rule is otherwise; and the Crown grants have at all times been construed most favourably to the King, where a fair doubt exists as to the real meaning of the instrument.\nIl me semble que dans une concession comme celle-ci si on avait voulu inclure, les rivi\u00e8res navigables on l'aurait certainement mentionn\u00e9.\nLa Cour Seigneuriale, appel\u00e9e \u00e0 examiner des concessions de la m\u00eame nature, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que ces contrats de concession ne pouvaient pas \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s comme comprenant les rivi\u00e8res navigables. (D\u00e9cisions de la Cour Seigneuriale, Vol. A, page 68 \u00e0 la 26\u00e8me Question.) Sir Louis-Hypolite La Fontaine, le Pr\u00e9sident de cette Cour disait, p. 358:\u2014\nDe tout ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de nous concluons que les seigneurs comme tous autres particuliers ont pu acqu\u00e9rir des droits dans des rivi\u00e8res navigables mais non pas de plein droit comme seigneurs de fiefs adjacents \u00e0 ces rivi\u00e8res, \u00e0 la diff\u00e9rence des rivi\u00e8res non navigables ni flottables dont la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 leur \u00e9tait d\u00e9volue \u00e0 ce seul titre.\nPour acqu\u00e9rir ces droits dans une rivi\u00e8re navigable, il leur fallait une concession expresse du Souverain.\nJe consid\u00e8re que dans les circonstances le contrat de concession sur lequel les appelants basent leur demande ne les autorise pas \u00e0 r\u00e9clamer la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 dans le lit de la rivi\u00e8re ou le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral maintient ses estacades.\nPour ces raisons, l'appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Aylen & Duclos.\nSolicitor for the respondent: F.

In 1909, territory of the county, including part of said road, was annexed to the City of Hamilton.\nHeld, Brodeur J. dissenting, that the agreement with the railway company remained in force in respect to the portion of road so annexed and the county was entitled to the whole annual payment as if the annexation had not taken place.\nThe railway company, by agreement in writing, accepted the said by-law of the county and covenanted with the latter \u201ctheir successors and assigns\u201d to perform all the conditions thereof.\nHeld, Brodeur J. dissenting, that the City of Hamilton did not, as a consequence of the annexation of county territory, become the \u201csuccessor\u201d of the county under said agreement and by-law so as to be entitled to a proportion of the payments to be made by the railway company thereunder.\nPer Fitzpatrick C.J. and Idington and Duff JJ.\u2014The Ontario Railway and Municipal Board was not invested with authority to provide, in its order extending the boundaries of the city, that such rights as those reserved by section 24 of the county by-law should, on such extension of the boundaries, pass to the city in whole or in part.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division (35 Ont. L.R. 434) reversed and that of the trial judge (31 Ont. L.R. 659) restored. APPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], reversing the judgment at the trial[2], in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe appellants in this action, the County of Wentworth, on the 6th of November, 1902, purchased from the Barton and Stoney Creek Consolidated Road Company for the sum of $24,000 certain toll roads which ran from a point in the County of Wentworth through the Township of Barton to the easterly boundary of the City of Hamilton. The respondents, the Hamilton Radial Electric Railway Company, by an agreement dated the 19th of June, 1905, acquired running rights over part of the said road from the County of Wentworth for the consideration therein named. On the 27th of September, 1909, upon the application of the City of Hamilton and Township of Barton (the County of Wentworth not being notified nor represented), the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board made an order annexing to the City of Hamilton, certain lands in the Township of Barton immediately adjoining the city through which lands certain portions of the said toll roads ran, and the order provided that all former toll roads purchased by the said county in the annexed territory, should vest in the City of Hamilton. After the aforesaid order was passed, and up to the year 1912, the appellants, the County of Wentworth, recognized it and permitted the City of Hamilton to exercise jurisdiction over the portions of the road included in the order of the Railway Board and to collect a proportionate part of the rental for the running rights thereon from the Hamilton Radial Electric Railway Company.\nIn the year 1913, the question of the validity of the said order of the Railway Board was raised and the County of Wentworth refused to further recognize the same, and upon the refusal by the Railway Company to pay the full amount of the rental due under and by virtue of the mileage agreement of the 19th of June, 1905, the County of Wentworth thereupon issued a writ against the Hamilton Radial Electric Railway Company for the payment of the rental due under the agreement of the 19th day of June, 1905, and arrears. The Railway Company thereupon made application and as a result of same the Municipal Corporation of the City of Hamilton were joined as party defendants in this action.\nThe action by the county was to recover the whole payment for the year 1914 and arrears for the three preceding years representing the sums paid to the city during those years as its proportion for the mileage annexed. As to these amounts both courts below held that the county could not recover after acquiescing in the payments to the city and from that decision there was no appeal.\nLynch-Staunton K.C. and Counsell for the appellant.\nRose K.C. and Waddell K.C. for the respondent the City of Hamilton.\nLeighton McCarthy K.C. and Gibson for the respondents The Hamilton Radial Electric Railway Co.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I agree with Mr. Justice Idington.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014What had been a toll road constructed by a private company was by it surrendered to appellant. Thereafter, pursuant to such juris- diction as appellant had, it bargained with the railway company respondent to confer upon it the franchise of using part of said road, for constructing and running thereon a railway, of the kind its name implies.\nThe franchise was given by section 1 of the by-law which reads as follows:\u2014\n1. The consent, permission and authority of the Corporation of the County of Wentworth is hereby granted to the Hamilton Radial Electric Railway Company (subject to and upon the terms, conditions and provisions hereinafter contained) to construct, maintain, complete and operate an electric railway along the Main Street Road, from Sherman Avenue to Delta, and on the King Street Road from the Delta easterly through the unincorporated Village of Bartonville to the Saltfleet Town Line.\nFor this franchise the said company agreed to comply with some twenty-four several terms and conditions specified in the appellant\u2019s by-law.\nTo hold many of these abrogated by reason of the events the city now herein relies upon in its present attitude relative to the 24th, would be rather embarrassing for it. Yet such would in many instances be the logical result of maintaining what it contends for.\nThe 24th is in these words:\u2014\n24. For the privileges hereby granted the Company shall pay to the Corporation of the County of Wentworth yearly at the commencement of each year, at the rate of FIFTY DOLLARS per mile or pro rat\u00e2 for portion of a mile per year for the first three years, and after the expiration of the first three years at the rate of ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS per mile, or pro rat\u00e2 for portion of a mile per year for the next five years, and at the rate of TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS per mile, per year thereafter for every mile or pro rat\u00e2 for portion of a mile of railway operated on the said county roads under this by-law. First payment to be made on the first day of January, 1907.\nWhatever else appears in the agreement made by the parties these two clauses (the first and twenty-fourth) furnish the keynote for the construction of the document.\nAnd surely there could not be clearer or more explicit terms used as to the basis upon or by which the compensation was to be measured.\nIt is\nfor every mile or pro rat\u00e2 for portion of a mile of railway operated on the said county roads under this by-law.\nIt mattered not whether the roads lost their character of county roads or not, or passed under some other jurisdiction the legislature chose to put them under, so long as the company continued to enjoy the franchise thus acquired and conferred.\nHowever questionable from an economic point of view I might feel inclined to think the bargaining between municipalities and railway companies whereby profits are to be reaped, I have no reason to doubt the now generally accepted legislative authority to make such bargains as falling within the power given municipalities in control of a highway, to consent to the use of highways by a railway.\nIndeed no argument was presented contesting this exercise of the power and there remains nothing in this case but the construction of a tolerably clear contract.\nIt seems to me a novelty to import into the consideration of the construction of the contract that which transpired later between third parties by reason of which some one else might have a right to pass by-laws or direct operations or means for the public safety relative to the maintenance of a part of the road.\nIt was quite competent for the parties to the contract to have included as their basis of the computation of the compensation to be given for the franchise the entire mileage over the part they were bargaining about or over the entire road if they saw fit.\nThey might have made the number of passengers carried from any place outside the city to the market place of the city or any other agreed point or in short any other mode of computation they saw fit.\nAs Mr. Justice Hodgins has well pointed out it is as a whole the subject-matter of the bargain was dealt with by those immediately concerned.\nThen what right has the respondent city to interfere? It knew, or ought to have known before bargaining for the annexation of part of a township all about the franchise in question, the terms upon which it was granted and the history leading up to the acquisition of those rights the county had acquired entitling it to so bargain.\nAnd I venture to submit that the city was quite as much interested as the county in the abolition of tolls and knew what it cost and that it had no more right to try to take away from another corporation without its consent part of the incidental advantages which had flowed to it from the promotion of free travel and good roads designed for their common benefit.\nOf course these considerations cannot answer the law if it has given respondent what appellant had acquired, but I submit they do answer much we have heard and read of the city\u2019s alleged burdensome duties relative to this part of its acquisition.\nThere is no pretence made that the appellants\u2019 by-law has been either expressly or impliedly repealed.\nThere is, by a curious confusion of thought, claimed to enure to the city a share in the compensation because it is based on mileage and the city has acquired jurisdiction over some of that mileage.\nThe argument confounds the rights flowing from a contract in relation to property and perhaps property itself, with those rights flowing from mere acquisi- tion of jurisdiction over it for certain limited purposes and within certain relations only.\nLet us see what the city did acquire. It obtained from the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board only that which the Lieutenant-Governor in Council was vested with relative to municipal annexations up to 1906, when 6 Edw. VII., ch. 31, by sec. 53 transferred same to the Board, and amending Acts.\nThe Municipal Amendment Act (1908) 7 Edw. VII., ch. 48, sec. 1, is, I assume, correctly presented in the city\u2019s factum as containing the said powers as existent at the time in question.\nThat section reads as follows:\u2014\nIn case the council of any city or town by resolution declare that it is expedient that any portion of an adjacent township should be annexed to the city or town, and in case the majority of the ratepayers in any such portion of such township petition the Lieutenant\u2011Governor in Council to add such portion to such city or town, and after due notice of such resolution and petition has been given by such city or town to such adjacent township, the Lieutenant-Governor may, by proclamation to take effect upon some day to be named therein, annex to the city or town such portion of the adjacent township upon such terms and conditions as to taxation, assessment, improvements or otherwise as may have been agreed upon, or shall be determined by the Lieutenant\u2011Governor in Council.\nIt is to be observed that the only terms or conditions of such changes of boundaries as agreed on with which the Lieutenant-Governor in Council or Board ever became entitled to meddle, were\nas to taxation, assessment, improvements or otherwise.\nI fail to see how anything in question herein falls within such terms.\nThe Board clearly exceeded its authority unless we ignore the ejusdem generis rule of construction and attribute to the word \u201cotherwise\u201d a meaning that might enable it to transfer the ownership of the courthouse, jail, and registry office (though presumably county property) to the city, because they happen to be within the city.\nThe suggestion that the city is the \u201csuccessor or assign\u201d of the county within the meaning of these usual words of contract between contracting corporations in the operative part of the contract between the railway company and the county, seems to me rather far fetched.\nWe are not referred to any express legislative enactment which would be effectively applicable to such a contract and constitute the city the successor of the county.\nThe Board had no power to confer any such right or meddle with anything relative to that or anything but that expressly given it by the language I have quoted.\nI have heard no answer made, or that can be made, by the railway company to its contract; or that either bound or entitled it to deal with any one else than the party it in fact contracted with.\nWhether or not there is anything in the usual arbitration claim relative to the consequences of annexation now standing we are told as in the Consolidated Municipal Act, 1903, sec. 58, need not concern us.\nThe railway company as I understand its attitude is only a proper party to this appeal by virtue of the unfounded contention of the city and should get its costs of this appeal from the latter.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs of the appellant and the railway company of this appeal and the appeal to the Appellate Division and the judgment of the learned trial judge be restored.\nDUFF J.\u2014By a by-law passed on the 10th of June, 1905, the municipal council of the County of Wentworth professed to enact that:\u2014 The consent, permission and authority of the Corporation of the County of Wentworth is hereby granted to the Hamilton Radial Electric Railway Company (subject to and upon the terms, conditions and provisions hereinafter contained) to construct, maintain, complete and operate an electric railway along the Main Street Road, from Sherman Avenue to Delta, and on the King Street Road from Delta easterly through the unincorporated village of Bartonville to the Saltfleet Town Line;\nand among a great variety of other provisions:\u2014\n24.\u2014For the privileges hereby granted the Company shall pay to the Corporation of the County of Wentworth, yearly, at the commencement of each year, at the rate of fifty dollars per mile or pro rat\u00e2 for portion of a mile, per year for the first three years, and after the expiration of the first three years at the rate of one hundred dollars per mile or pro rat\u00e2 for portion of a mile, per year, for the next five years, and at the rate of two hundred dollars per mile thereafter for every mile or pro rat\u00e2 for portion of a mile of railway operated on the said County Roads under this By-law First payment to be made on the first day of January, 1907.\nThe by-law provided that it should not take effect unless formally accepted by the company within ten days after the passing of it by an agreement binding the company to \u201cperform, observe and comply with all the agreements, obligations, terms and conditions\u201d therein contained. Accordingly on the 19th of June, 1905, an agreement was entered into between the respondent company and the appellant county corporation by which the company contracted to observe all the obligations imposed upon it by the terms of the by-law.\nSubsequently, i.e., in 1909, an order was made by the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board extending the boundaries of the City of Hamilton in such a way as to embrace within the territorial limits of the city certain parts of the county roads named in the first section of the by\u2011law, in which the respondent company was given the right to construct and operate its railway. After the passing of this order and down to and including the year 1912, it appears to have been assumed by the parties that the effect of the order of the board was to vest in the respondent city corporation the right to take and to impose upon the respondent company the obligation to pay to the city for the use of that part of the roads so named within the annexed territory occupied by the company\u2019s railway, a sum equivalent to $50 for each mile of railway within that territory. It was assumed, in other words, that the order extending the boundaries of the city did by its provisions transfer to that municipality and divest the county of the benefit of the moneys payable under section 24 to a degree proportionate to the number of miles of the railway which, by virtue of the order, came within the territory of the city. In the year 1913 the county for the first time disputed the validity of this assumption and called upon the company for the payment of the whole of the moneys payable under section 24, as if no change in boundaries had taken place.\nThe whole question in the action out of which the appeal arises is whether the county is or is not right in that contention. I am unable myself to entertain any doubt that the phrase \u201cthe said county roads\u201d in section 24 is descriptive of the roads in which by the by-law the county gave its consent to the company constructing and operating its railway; neither have I any doubt that the railway is now \u201coperated on the said county roads under this by-law.\u201d The county is therefore entitled to require payment of the whole of the sums made payable ex facie by section 24 of the by-law unless in some way their right to do so has been transferred to the city.\nThere are three ways, and three ways only, by which such a transfer could be legally effected; by agreement, by statute, or by the operation of some rule of law not resting on statute. Admittedly there is no agreement. For the reasons given by my brother Idington I think the powers of the board (where such an extension of the boundaries takes place) in respect of terms and conditions\u2014limited as those powers were to imposing terms and conditions relating to\ntaxation, assessment, improvements or otherwise\u2014\nare not sufficient to authorize a provision transferring to the city any of the rights created by section 24; and needless to say what the board could not do expressly it could not do by implication.\nThen is there any rule of law having the effect of vesting in the city corporation the right to which it now lays claim? The first contention is that the city corporation is the \u201csuccessor\u201d of the county corporation within the meaning of the words of the contract; but although it may be there is a sense in which the city corporation can be said to be the successor of the county corporation with respect to the county roads affected by the extension of boundaries, still it is sufficiently evident that the word \u201csuccessor\u201d (if it is not to be treated, as it probably should be, as mere surplusage) is used alio intuitu pointing to something in the nature of universal successor; and that the presence of it cannot help, as the absence of it would not in anywise impair, the city corporation\u2019s claim.\nIt is suggested that the rule governing the case is one derived by analogy to that which determines the apportionment of rent when title to the reversion in part of land held by a tenant is severed from that to the reversion in the residue. I do not think Mr. Rose meant us to understand him as arguing that the sums payable under the by-law could be treated as being rent service in contemplation of law. Self-evidently there is here no tenure of land and no reversion. To attempt to describe the railway company\u2019s rights simpliciter by reference to any of the well\u2011known categories of common law rights in alieno solo would probably be misleading. The company\u2019s rights are statutory and it is perhaps better, if one desires to avoid deceptive analogies, to treat them frankly as sui generis. If one must search for some general analogy, the analogy of easement or license is nearer the mark than that of tenancy; \u201crailway easement,\u201d though not in any sense, of course, a phrase of art, could mislead few lawyers in this country.\nBut with reference to the argument under consideration the characteristic of the railway company\u2019s rights to be noted and emphasized is that they are not rights created or capable of being created by the municipality as the owner of some sort of property in the soil of a highway. The highway as highway is a strip of soil in which His Majesty\u2019s subjects, as such, have rights of going and coming. The municipality is the public authority, speaking broadly, invested with the management of the highway and with certain powers in regulation of the exercise of the public right. The municipality does not derive its authority over the highway as such from any property in the soil; on the contrary, such property was vested in or could be acquired by the municipality precisely because the municipality is the public authority endowed with jurisdiction over the highway and charged with certain duties in relation to it; and it must be assumed that it was as public authority and not as proprietor that such power as it possessed to pass the by-law consenting to the construction and operation of the railway was entrusted to the municipality; and that it had such rights as it had to exact the consideration provided for in section 24 of the by-law. The parallel seems to fail.\nIt might, no doubt, be argued that as incidental to the transfer of jurisdiction the right to a proportionate part of the mileage toll should justly and reasonably pass to the city; but that argument should be addressed to the legislature.\nFinding, therefore, neither contract, nor statute nor principle of common law upon which the city\u2019s claim can rest, it follows that effect must be given to the contract in accordance with the view already expressed. The appeal ought to be allowed and the judgment of the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas restored. I think the city corporation should pay all the costs incurred in consequence of the appeals since the date of that judgment.\nANGLIN J.\u2014With deference, it seems to me that immaterial features of this case have unduly absorbed the attention of the courts below. For instance, we are not concerned with the past history of the roads in question as toll roads. The only relevant facts in that connection\u2014that upon the removal of the tolls from these roads by the County of Wentworth they became county roads under section 15 of the Toll Roads Expropriation Act, 1901, as enacted by section 6 of ch. 35 of the Ontario Statutes of 1902, and that when the contract sued upon was made they were under the jurisdiction of the county, so that it could validly and effectively grant the privileges or franchise over them which that contract purported to confer upon the Hamilton Radial Electric Railway Company\u2014are not contested. Neither does it seem to be of the least importance that the annexation order of the Municipal Board contained a provision\u2014probably as held in the Ontario courts, in excess of its authority\u2014which purported to vest in the City of Hamilton the portions of those roads lying within the annexed territory. It is unnecessary either to pass upon the question of the Board\u2019s jurisdiction to make this provision or to determine whether the title to the portions of the road in question became vested in the City of Hamilton immediately upon the annexation or remained vested in the County of Wentworth until the enactment of section 433 of the Municipal Act of 1913. The only material matter in connection with the action of the Board is its jurisdiction to order the annexation itself, which is uncontroverted and incontrovertible. Whether the order for annexation does full justice to the county in the matter of burdens which it had assumed in connection with the roads in question, or to the city in regard to the responsibilities imposed upon it for their future maintenance, is likewise beside the question with which we have to deal. There may, as Mr. Justice Garrow has suggested, be claims on the part either of the city or of the county, which would be proper subjects for arbitration under section 58 of the Consolidated Municipal Act of 1903\u2014now section 38 of ch. 192, R.S.O., 1914\u2014but these claims do not form part of the subject of this action. The introduction of all these matters merely tends to be-cloud and obscure the real issue presented, which is whether anything has transpired which has the legal effect of depriving the County of Wentworth of the contractual right that it formerly had, and would otherwise continue to possess, to collect from the Hamilton Radial Electric Railway Company the entire annual payments which that company bound itself to make to the county when it acquired the rights or franchise under which it maintains and operates its railway. By a by-law passed in June, 1905, to fulfilment of the terms and conditions of which the railway company duly bound itself by contract, the county authorized the construction, maintenance and operation by the railway company of an electric tramway on certain streets or roads then under the jurisdiction of the county. For the privilege thus granted to it the company undertook and agreed to pay to the county a money consideration or compensation, in some of the American cases called a bonus. Booth on Street Railways, 2 ed., secs. 284 and 287. Instead of a gross sum payable on the execution of the contract, as of course it might have been, this compensation took the form of annual instalments of fixed sums payable for each mile of the railway to be constructed, and pro rat\u00e2 for any portion of a mile. The question now presented is whether the annexation, in November, 1909, to the City of Hamilton of territory which includes portions of the roads or streets covered by the agreement between the county and the company, has affected the obligation of the latter to pay the stipulated compensation, in respect of such portions of the roads or streets, or has deprived the county of its right to recover the same or vested that right in the city.\nThe obligation of the company to pay is not contested. Rightly insisting upon the continuation of its franchise to maintain and operate its railway on the portions of the highways in question, the railway company could not consistently contest its correlative obligation to fulfil the condition as to payment of the compensation upon which the existence of that right depends. The substantial dispute is as to the body entitled to receive the moneys\u2014whether they belong to the county or to the city\u2014and for the present that dispute is confined to the instalment for the year 1914, the provincial courts having held that the county had acquiesced in the payments for 1911, 1912 and 1913 being made to the city and was thereby estopped from claiming them\u2014and from that part of the judgment there has been no appeal.\nUnder the terms of the contract the annual instalments are payable for the privilege granted to use the highways for the purpose, in the manner and on the terms stipulated in the county by\u2011law. That right is conferred by the by-law. Its existence depends upon it and is in nowise affected by the annexation to the city, which took the highways subject to it. The jurisdiction acquired by the city upon the annexation over certain portions of the roads on which the railway is constructed does not enable it to interfere with the franchise of the company, which is its property. Woodhaven Gas Co. v. Deehan[3]; Chicago General Railway Co. v. City of Chicago[4]; City of Grand Rapids v. Grand Rapids Hydraulic Co.[5] The description in the agreement of the roads dealt with as, \u201ccounty roads,\u201d if not geographical, as Mr. Justice Hodgins thinks it was meant to be, at all events has not the effect of confining the operation of the agreement to such portions of those roads as remain county roads in the legal sense throughout the term of the franchise. They were county roads in the legal sense when the agreement was made. That the portions of them in the annexed territory have ceased to be county roads within the meaning of that term in the Municipal Act is quite as immaterial as is the question whether the title to the freehold or soil of them passed to the city immediately upon the annexation. What is material is that the franchise or right to maintain and operate the tramway of the respondent company upon these portions of the highways was conferred by the county when they were, as portions of \u201ccounty roads,\u201d under its jurisdiction and when it had unquestioned power and authority to subject them to that right or franchise for whatever term it deemed proper and whatever the legal character of the roads might become, or however the ownership of the freehold or soil thereof might change during the term for which such right or franchise should be conferred. Those rights still subsist and they are now enjoyed and exercised by the company solely by virtue of their contract with the county and the county by-law. That by-law, because it affected roads, unlike other by-laws of the county, remained in force within the annexed territory (3 Edw. VII., ch. 19, section 56) and, so far as it authorized the conferring of property rights on the Hamilton Radial Electric Railway Company, cannot, notwithstanding the annexation, be repealed, altered or affected by the city to the prejudice of that company. If the consideration for the privilege granted to the company by the county had been a sum in gross paid on the execution of the contract, it is difficult to conceive on what basis the city could formulate a claim against the county for any part of the money so paid. It is from the county that the company has received its entire right or franchise over the roads in question. It takes nothing in that connection from the city. The annual instalments which it has bound itself to pay are just as much and just as truly the consideration for what it has obtained from the county, and from the county alone, as their total amount would have been if paid when the contract was made. On behalf of the respondent, the City of Hamilton; it was sought to treat these payments as rental, incident to and intended to follow a supposed reversion, and, as such, apportionable upon the severance or division of that reversion; and reliance was placed in this connection on section 433 of the Municipal Act of 1913, which declares the freehold and soil of every highway to be vested in the corporation of the municipality, the council of which exercises jurisdiction over it. This idea, though not in terms expressed, would appear to underlie the judgment of the late Mr. Justice Garrow, concurred in by Maclaren and Magee JJ. A., which proceeds on the assumption that because the annexation shortened the mileage in the county and transferred portions of the roads from the county to the city the right to collect the mileage payable in respect of the portions so transferred passed with the transfer. The order of the court is not confined to disaffirming the right of the county to the money in question: it directs the payment of it to the city. But the County of Wentworth was not a lessor and the railway company in no sense became its tenant. It acquired no right to exclusive possession of any part of the highway: City of St. Louis v. Western Telegraph Co.[6] The annual instalments are not charged upon and do not issue out of any land. Neither is there any reversion to which the right to receive them is incident or which it can follow. The transfer from the county to the city of jurisdiction over the parts of the highways in question, even though it carried with it the property in the soil or freehold, did not transfer to the city any interest in the moneys payable under the contract in question, for which the railway company had already received from the county the full and entire consideration.\nThere is no statute which takes from the county its contractual right to these moneys. There is no rule of law applicable to the circumstances which deprives it of that right or vests it in another. It has neither relinquished nor transferred it by contract. I know of no other means by which its title to the moneys can have been divested.\nWhile I express no opinion on the merits in this respect of the case at bar, I can conceive that it may be desirable that some body, such as the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board, should be endowed with authority to control contracts such as that now before us, which confer franchises exercisable in territory in which changes of municipal boundaries may occur, and thereupon to revise and readjust their terms. Such authority does not exist, however, and it can be created only by legislation.\nI would, for these reasons, with respect, allow this appeal with costs of the appellant and of the Hamilton Radial Electric Railway Company in this court and in the Appellate Division to be paid by the respondents, the Municipal Corporation of the City of Hamilton, and would restore the judgment of the learned trial judge.\nBRODEUR J. (dissenting)\u2014This is an action instituted by the County of Wentworth to claim from the railway company, respondent, a sum of money due for the year 1914 by virtue of an agreement made on the 19th June, 1905.\nBy that agreement the respondent railway company was authorized to run its street cars on some county roads which were under the jurisdiction of the appel- lant corporation and one of the clauses of that agreement was to the effect that the company should pay a yearly sum\nfor every mile or pro rat\u00e2 for portion of a mile of railway operated on the said county roads.\nIn 1909 a certain portion of the township of Barton in the County of Wentworth was annexed to the City of Hamilton by order of the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board and a portion of those county roads came, as a result of that annexation, under the jurisdiction of the City of Hamilton. The street railway respondent then apportioned its rental and paid to the County of Wentworth the portion of rent for the road which was under the jurisdiction of the County of Wentworth and paid the other portion to the City of Hamilton.\nBy its action the County of Wentworth claims that the whole amount should be paid to the county. The money was deposited in court by the railway company and the City of Hamilton claims that the portion of rent which they received from the railway company had been properly paid.\nThere may be some question as to the extent of the rights of the county corporation over the roads in question; but this question has been solved by an Act passed in 1913 (3 & 4 Geo. V., ch. 43) which declared that the soil of every highway shall be vested in the corporation of the municipality the council for which for the time being have jurisdiction over it.\nIt is not disputed that the Municipal Board had the right to annex a portion of the Township of Barton to the City of Hamilton. It is common ground also that as a result of that annexation the Council of Hamilton had jurisdiction over all the highways which were in the portion so annexed. As a result of that legislation of 1913 the City of Hamilton became also the owner of the soil over which those highways were built.\nThen what is the result of that jurisdiction and that ownership with regard to the payment of money which was stipulated for in the deed of the 19th of June, 1905, between the street railway company and the County of Wentworth?\nIf the sum which had been stipulated for the rent or for the easement in question were a lump sum, the question might be differently solved; but, in the case where it has been stipulated, as in this one, that the amount to be paid is so much per mile, it seems to me that the only conclusion which might be reached is that if a portion of the highway on which the street railway runs is transferred to the jurisdiction of another body and ceases to be a county road then the rights and obligations in connection with that portion of highway become vested in the new body.\nNobody will dispute that the City of Hamilton is now bound to look after the maintenance of that highway. But it is also entitled to receive all the rents which might be due in connection with the use of that highway. The rent, according to the law, is apportionable where the lessee ceases to have possession of the demised premises, provided this is not due to unlawful eviction by the elssor; thus it is apportionable where the lessee is evicted from part by a person lawfully claiming under title paramount. Halsbury, Laws of England, vol. 18, page 484.\nIt seems to me that the action by the County of Wentworth for the recovery of the rent and for the use of the road in question is not well founded and the judgment of the Court of Appeal which dismissed that action should be confirmed with costs. The appellant has contended and argued that the Municipal Board had illegally and unjustly, in their order, dealt with regard to the payment of a portion of the good roads debentures issued by the County of Wentworth. I did not deal with that question because I consider that it had no bearing on the issues raised by the plaintiffs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Bruce, Bruce & Counsell.\nSolicitors for the respondents The Hamilton Radial Railway Co.: Gibson, Levy & Gibson.\nSolicitor for the respondent the City of Hamilton: T.R.

Cf. Algoma Steel Corporation v. Dub\u00ea (53 Can. S.C.R. 48).\nBy an agreement between the Interurban Electric Co. and the City of Toronto, operating the Hydro-Electric System, the former undertook to \u201csave harmless and indemnify the said corporation * * * against all loss, damages * * * which the corporation may * * * have to pay * * * by reason of any act, default or omission of the company or otherwise howsoever.\u201d An employee of the company was killed in course of his employment and in an action by his personal representative the jury found that the city and the company were each guilty of negligence which caused the accident.\nHeld, that the agreement did not apply to the case of damages which the city would have to pay as a consequence of its own negligence and neither relieved it from liability nor entitled it to indemnity.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division (36 Ont. L.R. 269) affirmed. APPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], affirming the judgment at the trial against both defendants.\nThe action was brought by the respondent, Ada Lambert, against the appellants and the respondents, the Interurban Electric Company, Limited, to recover damages for the death of her son, Kenneth Lambert, a lineman in the employ of the respondents, the Interurban Electric Company, Limited, who was electrocuted while working for that company on one of their poles at the north-west corner of St. Clair Avenue and Bathurst Street, in the City of Toronto, on 13th March, 1914.\nOn the 13th March, 1914, the date of the accident to Kenneth Lambert, the Interurban pole and the Hydro-Electric pole were located on the north side of St. Clair Avenue, the Interurban pole being near the corner of Bathurst Street and the Hydro-Electric pole about six feet further west, and practically in line east and west.\nThe pole of the respondents, the Interurban Electric Company, was thirty-five feet in height and had attached to it two horizontal cross-arms, the upper of which was about nine inches below the top of the pole, and ran north and south, while the lower cross-arm was some two feet three inches below the top of the pole and ran east and west. This pole carried four high voltage wires carrying 2,200 volts each, which came north along Bathurst Street to the lower cross-arm, two of the wires being brought to the east and two to the west of the pole in the cross-arm. From this pole the easterly two wires continued northerly along Bathurst Street, but the westerly two wires were turned east along St. Clair Avenue. The turning was accomplished by taking the wires up from the west end of the lower cross-arm to the north end of the upper cross-arm by means of wire connections which are termed in the evidence \u201cjumpers\u201d or \u201crisers.\u201d\nThe appellants\u2019 pole (the Hydro-Electric pole) was about six feet west of the Interurban pole, and was a higher pole, forty feet in height; on top of it was a lightning arrester, connected with the ground by a wire which ran down along the north side of the pole, and was fastened to it with staples. The two guy wires which supported this pole were tied to it at distances of about one foot three inches and three feet three inches, respectively, from the top and ran from this pole easterly to the far side of Bathurst Street, passing almost directly over the Interurban pole. The lower of these guy wires was either touching the top of the Interurban pole or a few inches above it, and the higher guy wire was about two feet above that. Both guy wires were protected by \u201cstrain insulators,\u201d porcelain articles of globular shape, placed on the guy wires about six feet east of the appellants\u2019 pole, and which were accordingly about opposite the Interurban pole. The lower guy wire where it was tied around the appellants\u2019 pole was in contact with the ground wire which ran down from the lightning arrester to the ground.\nOn 16th March, 1914, a gang of men in the employ of the respondent, the Interurban Electric Company, and in charge of their foreman, Angus Cameron, were engaged in removing the westerly two wires which turned from this pole to run east along St. Clair Avenue. The foreman sent the deceased, Lambert, up the Interurban pole to cut away these two wires. Lambert went up the pole and cut the two \u201cjumpers\u201d or \u201crisers\u201d near the lower cross-arm, leaving exposed their live ends, called in the evidence \u201cpig-tails.\u201d He was standing with his right foot on the lower east and west cross-arm between the pole and the first pin, toe to the north, and his left leg thrown over the upper north and south cross-arm between the pole and the first pin. He was facing west with his body on the east side of the pole and as he leaned over the top of the pole to reach for a rope the heel of his left foot dangling over the upper cross-arm came in contact with one of the live pig-tails that he had made, while his left side was touching the appellants\u2019 lower guy wire, completing a circuit from the Interurban high voltage wire, through his body, the guy wire, the ground wire, to the ground, and he was killed instantly.\nThe action was tried at Toronto by Sir William Mulock, C.J., with a jury. The jury in answer to questions submitted to them found as follows:\u2014\n1. What was the cause of the accident? A.\u2014The accident was caused by Lambert\u2019s left heel coming in contact with the Interurban wire, and his left side touching the guy wire, which was in contact with the ground wire on the Hydro-Electric pole.\n2. Was the Corporation of the City of Toronto guilty of any negligence which caused the accident? A.\u2014Yes.\n3. If yes, in what did such negligence consist? A.\u2014By not having the strain insulators nearer the Hydro-Electric pole, and by not insulating the point of contact between the guy wire and the ground wire or lightning arrester on the Hydro pole.\n4. Was the Interurban Electric Company guilty of any negligence which caused the accident? A.\u2014Yes. 5. If yes, in what did such negligence consist? A.\u2014Before sending Lambert up the pole, the Interurban foreman should have noted that the strain insulators near his company\u2019s pole were in wrong position, and, that being so, should have directed his attention to the possibility of the guy wire being in contact with the ground wire on the Hydro pole.\n6. Was the deceased guilty of any negligence which caused or contributed to the accident? A.\u2014No.\n8. What damages, if any, do you award the plain-A.\u2014$2,700, $1,800 to be borne by the Hydro-Electric Company Company and $900 by the Interurban Electric Company.\nUpon the findings of the jury the learned trial judge gave judgment against both defendants for $2,700, and subsequently gave reasons for judgment dismissing the claim of each defendant against the other.\nBoth defendants appealed to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario as against the plaintiff and as against their co-defendant, and that court composed of Meredith C.J.C.P., and Riddell, Lennox and Masten JJ., dismissed the appeals of both, the Chief Justice dissenting.\nC.M. Colquhoun for the appellant. Under their agreement with the City the Interurban Co. could have no right of action against us and their employee would be in no better position. See Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Robinson[2]; Jones v. Morton Co.[3], at page 414; Dominion Natural Gas Co. v. Collins[4].\nThe negligence of the appellant was not of a nature to render probable the subsequent negligence of the Interurban Co and cannot have caused the accident. Beven on Negligence, 3 ed., p. 77; McDowall v. Great Western Railway Co.[5]; Ruoff v. Long & Co.[6]\nAs to our right to indemnity, see Pyman S.S Co. v.

Marten[12].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I agree with Anglin J.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I think the agreement between the two defendant companies cannot be invoked by the defendant appellant, the City of Toronto, against its co-defendant, the Interurban Electric Co., to relieve the city from its liability for the death of the deceased. That agreement does not extend, as I construe it, to cases where the accident causing the injury sued for was caused \u201cpartly directly,\u201d to use Lord Esher\u2019s own phrase many times repeated in the case of The Bernina[13], by the defendant corporation\u2019s own negligence as is found to be the case here.\nIn this case the jury have found on evidence which I think sufficient, that the deceased was not guilty of contributory negligence and I think that finding applies as well to the corporation defendant, the present appellant, as to its co-defendant the Interurban Company which employed the deceased.\nThe jury have also found the appellant-defendant, the Corporation of the City of Toronto, guilty of negligence which caused the accident\nby not having the strain insulators nearer the Hydro-Electric pole and by not insulating the point of contact between the guy wire and the ground wire or lightning arrester on the Hydro pole.\nIt is true they also found the other defendant, the Interurban Electric Company, guilty of negligence which caused the accident as follows:\u2014\nBefore sending Lambert up the pole, the Interurban foreman should have noted that the strain insulators near his company\u2019s pole were in wrong position and that being so should have directed his attention to the possibility of the guy wire being in contact with the ground wire on Hydro pole.\nBut that finding of negligence on the part of the Interurban Company does not discharge the City of Toronto from the consequences following the finding of negligence against it.\nBoth companies have been found guilty of negligence which \u201cpartly directly\u201d caused the accident and they are both and each liable for the consequences. To entitle the defendant, the City of Toronto, to shelter itself behind the negligence found against its co-defendant, the Interurban Electric Company, it must shew that this latter\u2019s negligence was\nthe conscious act of another volition\nand was the real cause which brought the injury about and without which the accident could not have happened.\nThe negligence of the electric company was that of one of its foremen, a mere case of negligence in over- looking the conditions existing when he ordered the deceased to climb the electric pole and do certain work. Such negligence does not come within the meaning of the words\u2014\nconscious act of another volition\nwhich under certain circumstances will remove liability from one whose previous negligence has \u201cpartly directly\u201d caused the injury complained of.\nConstruing the indemnity clauses of the agreement between the two defendants as I do, not to embrace or include a case of negligence on the part of both companies the negligence of each \u201cpartly directly\u201d causing the accident, and holding the finding of the jury as to the absence of contributory negligence applicable to both corporation and company alike and that there was no\nconscious act of another volition\nintervening between the negligence found against the corporation and the happening of the accident, but merely an additional act of negligence on the part of its co-defendants, the electric company, I would dismiss the appeal with costs to both respondents.\nDUFF J.\u2014The appellant municipality\u2019s (The Hydro EI.) pole, near the N.W. corner of Bathurst Street and St. Clair Ave., was about 6 ft. west of the Interurban Company\u2019s pole, and was about five feet higher. On the top of the appellant\u2019s pole was a lightning arrester connected with the ground by a wire running down the pole. One of the two guy-wires supporting this pole ran past the top of the Interurban pole touching, or almost touching, it. This guy-wire where it was tied around the appellant\u2019s pole was in contact with the. ground-wire of the lightning arrester. It had on it a porcelain insulator which was situated about six feet east of the Interurban pole. The deceased Kenneth Lambert, a lineman in the employ of the Interurban, was killed by an electric shock received while working on the Interurban pole on the 13th March, 1914. The Interurban pole had two horizontal cross-bars, one about nine inches and another about two feet three inches below the top. The lower arm ran east and west parallel with St. Clair Avenue and the other north and south parallel with Bathurst Street. The lower cross-arm supported four high voltage wires coming up Bathurst Street from the south, two of which passed on along that street to the north, the remaining two turning here and running east along St. Clair Avenue To accomplish this turning these two wires were connected by wire connections, called \u201crisers\u201d or \u201cjumpers,\u201d with the two wires fastened to the northern arm of the upper wire and carried thence to the company\u2019s pole to the east. This was the situation on the 13th of March, 1914, when the deceased Lambert was sent by his foreman to the top of the pole to do some work; and this condition of affairs, it may be added, had existed since the 25th of November, 1912, a year and a half before. On the occasion in question the foreman with a gang of men was engaged in removing the two westerly wires just referred to, and Lambert was sent up to cut them away. To do this it was necessary to cut the \u201cjumpers\u201d or \u201crisers,\u201d which he did, leaving the live ends exposed, referred to in the evidence as \u201cpig tails.\u201d Unhappily Lambert, standing with his right foot on the lower, east and west, cross-arm, his left leg thrown over the upper, north and south, cross-arm, his left foot which was dangling from the cross-arm was brought into contact with one of these live ends as he was reaching for a rope, while his right hand at the same time encountered the guy-wire of the appellant\u2019s pole, and a circuit being established through his body by way of the guy-wire and the ground-wire of the lightning arrester, he was instantly killed.\nTwo additional facts should be mentioned as introductory to the discussion of points in controversy. The first is that it was the practice in the Hydro-Electric system to attach guy\u2011wires in contact with ground-wires to the Hydro Electric poles, the only protection being an insulation similar to that above described. The other point is that the Interurban poles and wires were erected under the provisions of an agreement with the appellant municipality one term of which is set out in the 7th paragraph of it, and is in the following words:\u2014\nThe company shall save harmless and indemnify said corporation against any action, claim, suit or demand brought or made by the granting of any of the privileges hereinbefore mentioned to the company, and all costs and expenses incurred thereby, and also against all loss, damages, costs, charges and expenses of every nature and kind whatsoever, which the corporation may incur, be put to or have to pay, by reason of the improper or imperfect execution of their works or any of them, or by reason of the said works becoming unsafe or out of repair, or by reason of the neglect, failure or omission of the company to do or permit anything therein agreed to be done or permitted, or by reason of any act, default or omission of the company or otherwise howsoever.\nThe jury found that the accident was attributable to the negligence of the appellant as well as the negligence of the Interurban Company, the deceased Lambert being acquitted of contributory negligence. The appellant corporation denies its responsibility on the ground that there is no evidence of actionable negligence, on the ground that the deceased Lambert is chargeable with contributory negligence and that their responsibility to him is precluded by the terms of the contract with the Interurban company above set out, and they further claim to be entitled to indemnity as against the Interurban under the same agreement.\nFirst, as to contributory negligence It was a question for the jury, I think, whether Lambert, going about the execution of the manual work in which he was engaged, bent upon getting it done without waste of time, was acting reasonably in assuming that such sources of danger as might be created by the condition and situation of the poles and wires had been the object of attention on the part of his employers; I think it is impossible to say that the jury could not reasonably find affirmatively on that question and acquit Lambert, as they did, of contributory negligence.\nAs to the agreement. The point made against the respondent Ada Lambert, on the agreement is, as I understand it, that the Interurban pole was where it was and that Lambert, a servant of the Interurban company, was only entitled to be where he was by virtue of the agreement between the appellant and the Interurban company, and that consequently his rights, when there, must be such rights only as he could avail himself of against the appellant if he himself instead of the company were the contracting party This argument seems to be largely based upon the construction of the judgment of the Privy Council in Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Robinson[14]. I think the contention requires for its support a much broader principle than anything established by Robinson\u2019s Case14 because their Lordships there, as I read the judgment, put their decision upon the specific conclusion at which they arrived that the person who contracted with the railway company was Robinson\u2019s agent empowered to bind himself by any terms he might make with reference to the company\u2019s responsibility for the carriage of Robinson. Here there is of course no suggestion of agency, express or implied, and I think that on this ground the agreement must be rejected.\nIt is convenient at this point to dispose of the question of indemnity also. The stipulation relied upon has not, in my judgment, the effect of casting upon the appellant municipality responsibility for a condition of things primarily due to the negligence of the appellant itself. Where harm is caused and the appellant municipality is answerable by reason of the fact that its own negligence is a proximate cause of that harm, I do not think such responsibility is fairly within the contemplation of clause 7.\nIt is true that the phrase \u201cotherwise however\u201d is a very broad one; but the language of the clause shews that it was framed alio intuitu and we should violate a fundamental rule of construction if sweeping words placed at the end of a more specific enumeration were to be read as embracing cases which it is abundantly evident from the clause (when read as a whole) the parties never had in contemplation. It is not the \u201cact, default or omission\u201d of the Interurban Company for which the appellant municipality is held responsible, it is the municipality\u2019s own wrongful act.\nBut is there evidence of wrongful act, or in other words, is there evidence of actionable negligence for which the appellant municipality is responsible and to which as a proximate cause Lambert\u2019s death may be attributable?\nNow it is quite true that to affirm this is to affirm, first, that the appellant company was guilty of a breach of duty to Lambert, and, secondly, that Lambert\u2019s death was a consequence of that breach. It is quite true also that but for the placing of the Interurban pole in the situation in which it was, and but for the Negligent omission of the servants of the Interurban Company to observe and warn their employees against the dangerous situation created by the proximity of the uninsulated guy-wire to the Interurban pole, this accident would not have happened.\nThe fact that the Interurban pole was brought into this position after the appellant municipality\u2019s pole had been placed where it was at the time of the accident, does not appear to me to be a circumstance of much importance. As I have already said, the situation created by the proximity of these poles and wires, the wires being in the condition in which they were, had been in existence unchanged for some eighteen months preceding the accident.\nIn these circumstances the jury were entitled to find as a fact that the appellant municipality was concurrently responsible with the Interurban company for the existence of this dangerous state of things; and as to the neglect of the servants of the Interurban company and particularly the neglect of the foreman to observe and give warning of this dangerous situation, the rule applies which is stated by Lord Sumner (then Hamilton L.J.) in Latham v. Johnson & Nephew[15], at page 413:\u2014\nA person who, in neglect of ordinary care, places or leaves his property in a condition which may be dangerous to another may be answerable for the resulting injury, even though but for the intervening act of a third person or of the plaintiff himself (Bird v. Holbrook[16]; Lynch v. Nurdin[17], that injury would not have occurred. In such circumstances the duty not to neglect ordinary care incumbent upon both the appellant municipality and the Interurban Company was a duty owing by the appellant company to the servants of the Interurban Company. It follows that the appeal in both branches of it should be dismissed.\nANGLIN J.\u2014In the appellants\u2019 factum four distinct objections taken to the judgment holding them liable to the plaintiff for the death of her son and not entitled to indemnity from their co\u2011defendants are stated as follows:\u2014\n(1) The deceased as an employee of the Interurban Electric Company could claim no greater right than his employers who were on the street at their own risk and on condition that their presence should not result in loss or expense to the appellants.\n(2) The deceased was, as against the appellants, guilty of contributory negligence which caused the accident.\n(3) The negligence of the appellants as found by the jury was not the real or proximate cause of the accident.\n(4) By the provisions of the agreement between the appellants and the respondent, the Interurban Electric Company, the said respondent agreed to indemnify and save harmless the appellants against liability in this action.\nFor convenience I shall refer to the Municipal Corporation as the corporation, and to the Interurban Electric Company as the company.\nApart from the question involved in the first ground of appeal\u2014whether the deceased as a servant of the company was so identified with his employers that his right of recovery must depend upon the existence of facts which would give them a right of action against their co\u2011defendants, the corporation, for any damage they might sustain through fault of the latter (which I must not by any means be taken to regard as concluded in favour of the appellants)\u2014 see Algoma Steel Corporation v. Dub\u00e9[18]\u2014the first and fourth grounds of appeal rest upon the following clause of an agreement made between the two defendants:\u2014\nThe Company shall save harmless and indemnify said Corporation against any action, claim, suit or demand brought or made by the granting (sic.) of any of the privileges hereinbefore mentioned to the Company and all costs and expenses incurred thereby, and also against all loss, damages, costs, charges and expenses of every nature and kind whatsoever, which the Corporation may incur, be put to or have to pay by reason of the improper or imperfect execution of their works or any of them or by reason of the said works becoming unsafe or out of repair or by reason of the neglect, failure or omission of the Company to do or permit anything herein agreed to be done or permitted, or by reason of any act, default or omission of the Company or otherwise howsoever, and should the Corporation incur, pay or be put to any such loss, damages, costs, charges or expenses, the Company shall forthwith upon demand repay the same to the Corporation.\nThe Company shall repair broken wires forthwith and make all other repairs on reasonable notice and shall keep same in good repair.\nWhile it would, no doubt, have been quite possible for the corporation to have guarded against any liability to the company and to have provided, for indemnification by it for any damages arising however indirectly out of the presence on its streets of the poles and lines of the company, even where such damages should be directly occasioned by the negligence of corporation employees, it would undoubtedly be necessary that such a provision should be expressed in clear and explicit language. Here there is nothing of the kind. There is nothing from which any implication of an intention to provide for such a right of indemnification can be inferred. The application of the words \u201cor otherwise howsoever,\u201d invoked by counsel for the appellants, having regard to one of the most familiar rules of construction cannot extend to some- thing so entirely foreign to the context as damages caused by negligence of the other party to the agreement.\nNeither should the clause be read as relieving the corporation from liability for, or entitling it to indemnity against claims for injuries partly occasioned by its own negligence, though operating in conjunction with negligence of the company or its servants. Only an explicit provision couched in unmistakable terms could be given that effect. Here damages due to negligence of the corporation, either as a sole cause or as a contributing causative factor, are not even hinted at. To import such a case by implication as one of the things for which the company assumed entire responsibility would be quite unjustifiable. If under the agreement the company would itself be entitled to recover damages from the corporation for injuries to its property placed upon the streets in the exercise of the franchise thereby conferred, caused by negligence imputable to the corporation, as I think it would, an employee of the company, who has sustained such an injury, must a fortiori have a right of action against the corporation. Fault imputable to the company (such as the negligence of its foreman found by the jury in this case), which might under a plea of contributory negligence afford the corporation a defence in an action brought by the company for damages to its property caused by negligence of the corporation\u2019s servants, may not be ascribed to the plaintiff\u2019s son as an employee of the company so as to debar recovery for personal injury to him under such a plea. It follows that the first and fourth objections fail.\nThe second objection is conclusively disposed of by the adverse finding of the jury upon it, which is clearly made against both defendants. It is impossible to say that this finding, negativing personal contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff\u2019s deceased son, affirmed in the Appellate Division, is so preposterous that no honest or reasonable jury could have made it.\nThe third ground of appeal involves the familiar question as to liability where negligence of two independent persons or bodies is found to have been the cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries. The first of Lord Esher\u2019s well-known propositions upon the law of negligence, stated in The Bernina[19], at page 61, and the decisions in such cases as Burrows v. March Gas and Coke Co.[20], are conclusive against the appellant. The authorities upon this branch of the case are conveniently collected in Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England, vo. \u201cNegligence,\u201d par. 649. That a lineman of the company might be injured just as the plaintiff\u2019s son was, was a natural consequence of the appellants\u2019 negligence. That the injuries sustained by the plaintiff\u2019s son were a direct consequence of that negligence is incontestible. There was no intervention of a conscious act of another volition operating as a real cause to interrupt the chain of causation between the appellants\u2019 negligence and the consequences complained of. They cannot invoke as an excuse the failure of their co-defendants\u2019 foreman to prevent that negligence becoming operative. Both it and the negligence of the company\u2019s foreman (assuming the correctness of the jury\u2019s finding as to the latter, which is now not open to question) were in fact operative at the moment when Lambert was killed. Both were truly active causes. Neither can be said to have been merely a condition sine qua non of that which occurred. Algoma Steel Corporation v. Dub\u00e9[21].\nThe appeal, in my opinion, fails and should be dismissed with costs to be paid by the appellants to both respondents\nBRODEUR J.\u2014This is an action instituted under Lord Campbell\u2019s Act.\nThe plaintiff\u2019s son was an employee of the defendant, the Interurban Electric Company, as lineman, and while working on the cross-arms of the electric poles of that company he met his death from an electric current.\nThe appellant, the City of Toronto had a pole carrying light and power wires situated near the one on which the victim, Lambert, was working. The guy wire which assisted in the support of this city pole was fastened tightly around that pole and was coming in direct contact with a ground wire running down the city pole to the ground. That guy wire extended over the pole of the Interurban Electric Company and the guy wire then in its direct contact with the ground wire on the city pole was loaded with electric current at high voltage and the victim, in working near by that guy wire, came in contact with it and was killed.\nThe action was instituted against the City of Toronto and against the company for which Lambert was working and by the verdict of the jury the City of Toronto was declared guilty of negligence for not having the strain insulators nearer their pole, and by not insulating the point of contact between the guy wire and the ground wire. Nobody can find fault with that verdict This guy wire was for the purpose of sustaining the pole belonging to the city. It was their duty to see that this guy wire should not come in contact with the loaded wires, and if it was exposed to come in contact they should also have put insulators at such a place where accidents could be avoided.\nThere is, in this case, an insulator; but the insulator, instead of being placed between the poles and so avoiding any accident to those who would have to work on the company\u2019s pole, was placed further away.\nThe verdict of the jury also stated that the company was liable because its foreman, before sending Lambert up the pole, should have noted that the insulator was in a wrong position. There is no appeal before us with regard to the verdict rendered against the company.\nThe aggregate amount which was given by the verdict to the plaintiff was $2,700: 2-3 to be paid by the City of Toronto and $900 by the respondent company.\nThis verdict should be sustained because there was, no doubt, negligence by the City of Toronto.\nBut the latter claims that under a contract existing between the company and itself it should be indemnified for that judgment:\nWhen the company desired to erect poles in the place in question they applied to the municipal authorities then having jurisdiction and the counci consented to grant such permission, subject to certain conditions. One of those conditions was that the company should indemnify the municipal corporation against any action in consequence of the granting of the privilege mentioned in the contract, and also against all damages which the corporation might incur by reason of the imperfect execution of their work\nor by reason of any act, default or Omission of the company or otherwise howsoever.\nThe jury have found, it is true, that the foreman of the respondent company gave improper orders to the victim. But at the same time the jury stated that the City of Toronto was mostly responsible for the accident because it was due to defective connections or stringing of their wires.\nIt is not a case, in my opinion, covered by the indemnification clause above mentioned. It is clear that no injury would have been suffered by the deceased if the defendants had not fastened their guy wire in direct and immediate contact with their ground wire and if they had placed their insulator in the proper position. The liability of the City of Toronto results because of its own negligence and the condition on which the City of Toronto relies does not go so far as to state that the company will be bound to indemnify it for the appellant\u2019s own negligence.\nI come to the conclusion that the judgment rendered by the Appellate Division should be confirmed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: William Johnston.\nSolicitor for respondent Ada Lambert: Henry C.

The principal objections urged against a conviction upon the charges mentioned were (a) that by the manner in which the trial had been conducted the jury may have been given the impression that the accused was on trial for conspiracy, a non-extraditable offence; (b) that misstatements and inflammatory observations had been made by counsel for the Crown in addressing the jury; and (c) that, in his charge, the trial judge had failed to correct impressions which may have been thus made on the minds of the jury or to instruct them that portions of the evidence admitted in regard to other counts ought not to be considered by them in disposing of the charge of obtaining money under false pretences.\nHeld, that, as there was sufficient evidence to support the verdict of the jury on the charge of obtaining money under false pretences, quite apart from the irregularities alleged to have taken place at the trial, no substantial wrong or miscarriage had been occasioned and there could be no ground for setting aside the conviction or directing a new trial under the provisions of section 1019 of the Criminal Code.\nJudgment appealed from (11 West. W.R. 46), affirmed. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1], upon a reserved case submitted by Mr. Justice Prendergast, the presiding judge at the trial of the appellant who was convicted upon four of the counts of the indictment preferred against him.\nThe accused was tried on five counts of an indictment, in substance as follows: (1) Theft of money, valuable securities and other property, belonging to the King, in the right of the Province of Manitoba; (2) unlawfully receiving money, valuable securities or other property belonging to the King which had been embezzled, stolen or fraudulently obtained by means of a conspiracy between the accused and others to defraud the King, the accused then knowing the same to have been so embezzled, etc., by means of said conspiracy; (3) a count similar to the second count, but naming two additional co-conspirators; (4) obtaining moneys by false pretences from His Majesty for the accused and others; (5) unlawfully receiving moneys of His Majesty which had to the knowledge of the accused been obtained by false pretences with intent to defraud.\nThe jury acquitted the accused on the third count, but brought in a verdict of guilty on all the others.\nThe issues raised on the present appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nThe questions reserved for consideration by the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, with the answers ordered to be returned thereto by that court were as follows:\u2014\n\"1. Was I right in refusing to quash the whole indictment on the motion of counsel for the accused upon the grounds urged by them in their argument before me? A. Yes. \"2. Was I right in refusing to quash the first count in the indictment upon the motion of counsel for the accused upon the grounds urged by them in their argument before me? A. Yes.\n\"3.

Was I. right in refusing to quash the fifth count in the indictment upon the motion of counsel for the accused upon the grounds urged by them in their argument before me? A. No.\n\"6. If any of the said counts should have been quashed or otherwise dealt with by me, either before or during the trial, has there been a mis-trial of the accused on any other count or counts by reason of the admission of evidence upon such count or counts as should have been quashed or otherwise dealt with by me? A. No.\n\"7. Was I right in my charge to the jury on the first count of the indictment as to theft or was my charge insufficient in law so as to be prejudicial to a fair trial of the accused? A. To the first part of question preceding the word 'or'\u2014Yes; to remainder of question\u2014No.\n\"8.\" Was I right in my charge to the jury on the fourth count of the indictment as to what constituted the offence of obtaining money by false pretences or was my charge insufficient in law so as to be prejudicial to a fair trial of the accused?

Was I right in admitting evidence as to acts, conduct, admissions, conversations and facts relating to some one or more of those named in the second count, namely: Rodmond P. Roblin, Walter H. Montague (since deceased), James H. Howden, George R. Coldwell, R. M. Simpson and Victor W. Horwood, to which the accused was not a party, and, if I have erred, was the same prejudicial to a fair trial of the accused? A. To first part of question down to and including the word 'party'\u2014Yes; to remainder of question\u2014No.\n\"10.

The jury having found the accused Thomas Kelly not guilty on the third count in the indictment, and evidence having been admitted on said count upon the trial, was the admission of such evidence prejudicial to a fair trial of the accused on the remaining four counts in the indictment upon which he was found guilty? A. No.\n\"12. Was I right in permitting the affidavits on production of Thomas Kelly, Lawrence Kelly and Charles Kelly, Exhibits 62 and 63, in a civil action of the Attorney-General of Manitoba against Thomas Kelly & Sons to be put in evidence in the manner disclosed by the record against the accused Thomas Kelly, and, if not, was the same prejudicial to a fair trial of the accused? A. To first part of question down to words 'and, if not'\u2014Yes; to remainder of question\u2014No.\n\"13.

A. To first part of question down to and including the word 'Crown'\u2014Yes; to remainder of question\u2014No.\n\"14. Was any evidence admitted or allowed to be given which should not have been admitted or allowed to be given and which was prejudicial to a fair trial of the said Thomas Kelly, in regard to the matters set out in Schedule 'E'? A. No.\n\"15. Was I right in my comments upon the statement of the accused to the jury, with respect to it not being-made under oath, and, if so, was this prejudicial to a fair trial of the accused or a violation of the \"Canada Evidence Act?\" A. To first part of question down to and including the word 'oath'\u2014Yes; to remainder of question\u2014No.\n\"16. Similarly were any of the observations of counsel for the Crown so inflammatory or improper as to prejudice the fair trial of the accused or to be a violation of the \"Canada Evidence-Act?\" A. The first part of this question 'Were any of the observations of counsel for the Crown so inflammatory or improper as to prejudice the fair trial of the accused?' is not a question of law that may be reserved for the Court of Appeal under the Criminal Code. To the second part of the question\u2014No.\n\"17. Was there in any respect, on my part, either a failure to direct the jury or an inaccurate direction to the jury with regard to the difference between a statement made by the accused to the jury and an address made on his behalf to a jury; or as to the weight that a jury is entitled to attach to the statements of the accused which are not made under oath or as to pointing out evidence favourable to the accused or in regard to correcting any mis-statements as to law or fact made by the Crown counsel during the trial or any addresses to the jury? A. No.\"\nThe majority of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, upon the rendering of the judgment appealed from, by which the above answers were returned, consisted of His Lordship Chief Justice Howell and their Lordships Justices Perdue and Cameron. Their Lordships Justices Richards and Haggart dissented and were of opinion that there should be a new trial and that such new trial should be upon the fourth count of the indictment only.\nDewart K.C. and Harding for the appellant (Sweatman with them. The inflammatory and improper observations of counsel for the Crown to the jury afford ground for a new trial. In Pritchard's Practice of the Quarter Sessions, p. 22, it is laid down that prosecuting counsel addressing the jury ought to confine themselves to the simple statement of the facts expected to be proven; where prisoner has no counsel they should particularly refrain from stating any facts, proof of which may appear doubtful. Even where the prisoner has counsel, they should refrain from invective or appealing to the prejudices or passions of the jury, it being neither in good taste or right feeling to struggle for a conviction as is done in a civil court: Reg. v. Thursfield[2], per Gurney B. See also Archbold's Criminal Pleading, (24 ed.,) pp. 219-220; Reg. v. Holchester[3]; per Blackburn, J.; Reg. v. Berens[4]; Reg. v. Webb[5]; Rex v. Webb[6]; Ibrahim v. The King[7], at p. 616. We take objection to the comments and directions, or lack of directions, by the learned trial judge, particularly regarding theft and false pretences and the failure of the accused to testify. See Rex v. Hill[8] and Reg. v. Coleman[9], per McMahon J., at page 108. The trial judge failed to point out facts favourable to the accused: Rex v. Dinnick[10]; Rex v. Richards[11]; Rex v. Totty[12]; Reg. v. Parkins[13]; Rex v. Beauchamp[14]; Reg. v. Mills[15].\nThe learned trial judge failed to clearly point out to the jury the difference between the offences of theft and receiving and conspiracy and obtaining by false pretences, and what evidence was admissible under each offence charged, what evidence affected each count, and that evidence involving conspiracy could not affect the counts for theft or false pretences. He should have pointed out the inconsistency of a verdict on all four counts.: Rex v.Wong On[16]; Reg. v. Paul[17], per Hawkins J., at p. 211.\nThere was wrongful admission of evidence in several respects, more especially relating to earlier events and to later conspiracies: Reg. v. Blake[18]; Reg. v. Barry[19]. The admission of evidence, under the second count, upon a general charge of conspiracy relating to persons other than the accused; and of evidence under count three, relating to a conspiracy in which the sons of the accused were joined as parties, altogether apart from the question as to the admissibility of evidence of subsequent conspiracies, were admissible only upon a charge of conspiracy to defraud. That charge should not have been preferred and evidence tending to prove it was clearly prejudicial to a fair trial on the remaining counts of the indictment. This evidence was not admissible under the other counts and the jury should have been so directed. The view that, by holding that there was ample evidence of some offence and, consequently, no substantial wrong or miscarriage occurred cannot prevail; the court cannot be the judge of what may have influenced the minds of the jury where evidence of an important character was improperly admitted: Allen v. The King[20]; Bray v. Ford[21]; Makin v. Attorney-General of New South Wales[22], at pages 69-70.\nThe first count, which charges theft, is bad for duplicity: sec. 853, sub-sec. 3, Criminal Code; Halsbury, Laws of England, vol. 9, p. 340; Reg. v. Lamoureux[23], at p. 103; Archbold (24 ed.), pp. 75, 76, 81, 84; Rex v. Molleur[24]; Rex v. Michaud[25]; The judge should have charged the jury as to what constitutes theft, explained the nature of colour of right, that taking must be against the will of the owner, and also that these elements were lacking in the case.\nThe second count is bad for duplicity or for triplicity; both conspiracy and receiving are charged, an earlier conspiracy \"theretofore,\" and a later receiving. It confuses charges for receiving what had been embezzled, what had been stolen, and what had been obtained by a conspiracy to defraud. See Halsbury, vol. 9, p. 678. Nowhere in the Extradition Treaty, signed at Washington on 12th July, 1889, is conspiracy to defraud mentioned; by article 3, no person surrendered may be tried for any offence other than that upon which he was surrendered. See also the \"Extradition Act,\" R.S.C., 1906, ch. 155, secs. 30 to 32; and R.S.C., 1906, ch. 142, secs. 22 and 23; In re Gaynor and Greene[26].\nAs to count four, the judge did not explain to the jury that the money in question was not parted with upon the strength of any false representation made by the accused knowing it to be false. No payment was made except by authority of contract or order-in-council. There can.be no agency in crime: Reg. v. Butcher[27], at p. 19.\nThe practice adopted of including in one indictment many different offences is vicious, because the evidence admitted upon any count has a prejudicial effect against the prisoner on other counts, and particularly so where different kinds of crimes are charged with an alternative count of receiving: Per Hawkins J. in Reg. V. King[28], at p. 216.\nThe accused cannot be guilty of all four offences as found by the jury. The conviction could only be on one of these counts, but there is a specific verdict of guilty on each count: Reg. v. Russett[29]; Rex v. Fisher[30]. He cannot be guilty of any two offences. The penalties vary. The whole conviction is bad. One guilty of stealing goods as a principal cannot be convicted of receiving them: Halsbury, vol. 9, page 678 (footnote n). To be guilty of receiving stolen property it must have been taken by a person other than the person accused of receiving: Reg. v. Lamoureux[31]; Reg. v. Coggins[32]; Reg. v. Perkins[33].\nThe indictment is also bad for duplicity. Cyc, vol. 22, 376: \"An indictment or information must not in the same count charge the prisoner with the commission of two or more distinct and separate offences and in case it does so it is bad for duplicity.\" The jury having found the prisoner guilty of theft, four kinds of receiving and false pretences, at the same time found him to be a conspirator. The Crown deliberately went to trial upon an indictment defective and bad for duplicity, triplicity and improper joinder, without considering the reservations made by Mr. Justice Holmes' judgment in the Supreme Court of the United States. The Crown should stand or fall by its own deliberate action. The conviction should be quashed.\nThe object of a motion to quash before trial is to preserve the rights of the accused at all stages, and particularly in the event of a verdict against the accused. The Crown has the right to amend, to sever, to elect which counts shall be proceeded upon\u2014if necessary to prefer a new indictment or new indictments. But the Crown did not do so and the accused is entitled to the benefit of all the preliminary objections taken upon the motion to quash the indictment. The indictment was preferred and found when appellant was outside the Dominion of Canada, to the knowledge of the Attorney-General of Manitoba. The motion that was made under section 898 of the Criminal Code was absolutely necessary to preserve the rights of the accused as to any defects. The objection then taken was that the indictment had been preferred by the Attorney-General without legal authority. The Attorney-General knowing that the accused was not in Canada, in his absence, and while extradition proceedings were in progress, caused the indictment to be laid. The Attorney-General had no right to avail himself of the power to prefer an indictment in the absence of the accused and while he had himself undertaken proceedings under the \"Extradition Act.\" His consent to preferring the indictment is not a mere formality: Reg. v. Bradlaugh[34].\nJ. B. Coyne K.C. and R. W. Craig K.C. for the respondent. The appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada can only be based on the grounds as to which there was a dissent in the Court of Appeal for Manitoba: Mcintosh v. The Queen[35]; Eberts v. The King[36]; Mulvihill y. The King[37]; See also Rice v. The King[38]; Gilbert v. The King[39]. The second count is not in contravention of the \"Extradition Act\" and the treaty. It is in the exact terms of the Canadian warrant for Kelly's apprehension, of the American complaint or information, of the American warrant for his apprehension, and of the extradition commissioner's recommendation to the Secretary of State; the accused was surrendered for trial on this charge.\nAs to conspiracy, see Russell on Crimes (7 ed.), pp. 146 and 191; Reg. v. Parnell[40], at p. 515; Taylor on Evidence (10 ed.), sec. 591. The offence is complete when the agreement is made: Reg. v. Connelly[41]; Rex v. Parsons[42]. If, therefore, two persons pursue by their acts the same object, often by the same means, one performing one part of the act and the other another part so as to complete it with a view to the attainment of the common object they were pursuing, the jury are free to infer that they had been engaged in a conspiracy to effect that object: Reg. v. Murphy[43], per Coleridge J.; Rex v. Cope[44]; Rex v. Pollman[45] at page 233.\nA person concerned in any part of the transaction alleged as conspiracy may be found guilty, though there is no evidence that he joined in concerting a plan until some of the prior parts of the transaction were complete: Rex v. Lord Grey[46]; Rex v. Hammond[47]; Stephen's Digest of Evidence (4 ed.), pages 6 and 7.\nSee also Rex v. Wilson[48]; Reg. v. Shellard[49]; Reg. v. Blake[50].\nThe evidence is admitted on the ground that the act or declaration of one is the act or declaration of all when united in one common design. It is the principle of agency which, once established, combines the conspirators together and makes them mutually responsible for the acts and declarations of each: Wright, Criminal Conspiracy, p. 213, and pp. 212, 216; Russell on Crimes, p. 192; Roscoe, 355 at foot; Rex v. Johnston[51]; Rex v. Nerlich[52]; Reg. v. Jessop[53]; Reg. v. Charles[54], at p. 502; Reg. v. Desmond[55]. There is direct evidence of Kelly's part in tampering with witnesses, fabricating and suppressing evidence, and upholding the fabricated evidence before the Public Accounts Committee.\nWhen a criminal act has been proved and it is desired to connect the accused therewith it is relevant to shew that he had or had not a motive for the act or means and opportunity of doing it or that he had made preparations with that end in view or had threatened to do the act; the subsequent conduct of the accused often furnishes still further cogent evidence of guilt, e.g., possession of recently stolen property, flight, or the fabrication or suppression of evidence: 13 Halsbury, pp. 447, 448; Wigmore on Evidence, sec. 278; Moriarty v. London Chatham and Dover Rway. Co.[56]. The fabrication or suppression of evidence is none the less admissible because the accused called others to his assistance. If conspiracy were the charge it would not be necessary to set out the overt acts: Reg. v. Blake[57], at page 133; Rex v. Hutchinson[58]; Reg. v. O'Donnell[59] Rex v. Gitt[60]. And if some overt acts were set out, the Crown would not be confined to them, but might prove others: Reg. v. Stapylton[61], per Wightman J., at p. 71.\nCrown counsel's address was not an appeal to prejudice, but a plain and decided statement of the evidence. There can be no wrong done when statements are founded on evidence. The jury could not possibly have come to any other conclusion than that of the guilt of the accused on the evidence submitted irrespective altogether of the language of Crown counsel complained of. This is not a question which can be reserved for the opinion of the court of appeal: Rex v. Nerlich[62], per Hodgins J. at p. 317; Rex v. Banks[63].\nAs to clause 15 of the reserved case and the charge of trial judge regarding the statement of accused to the jury not being made under oath. The accused had no right to make a statement. He had the right to go into the witness-box and give his evidence on oath. There is a distinction between the English and Canadian Acts. The former has a saving section, negativing what would otherwise be the law, and providing that, notwithstanding the fact that he may give evidence on oath, the accused may still make an unsworn statement: Rex v. Krafchenko[64]., at pp. 658, 659. As to what would be considered comments, see Rex v. King[65], at page 434; and Rex v. McGuire[66]. The remarks complained of do not constitute a comment prohibited by the \"Canada Evidence Act,\" section 4, sub-section 5: in Rex v. Hill[67] and in Reg v. Coleman[68] there was direct comment on failure to testify. See Reg. v. Weir[69], at pages 269-271; Rex v. Aho[70]; Rex v. Guerin[71].\nThe powers of the appellate court are stated in the Criminal Code, secs. 1018, 1019 and 1020. Some substantial wrong or miscarriage must have been occasioned at the trial. The court may give separate directions as to each count and may pass sentence on any count unaffected by any wrong or miscarriage which stands good, or may remit the case to the court below with directions to pass such sentence as justice may require. A new trial is not justified here under sec. 1019.\nThere was no reserve case submitted on joinder of counts and argument on that point must be eliminated. Rex v. Hughes[72], at 454. There was no dissent in the Court of Appeal on this point. There was no objection to joinder before pleading, as required by the Code, sec. 898: Reg. v. Flynn[73]. Counts may be joined as in this indictment: Rex v. Lockett[74]; Rex v. Seham Yousry[75]; Reg. v. Poolman[76]; Rex v. Beauchamp[77]; Reg. v. Smith[78]. Under the Code, sec. 857, this is a matter in the discretion of the trial judge, and is not subject to review. There was a conviction on counts 1, 2, 4 and 5. No question was reserved for the Court of Appeal as to whether such verdict was inconsistent.\nAs to the charge on count 1 as to theft, and as to colour of right. The fraudulent contracts constituted no colour of right: Reg. v. Kenrick[79]. As for \"against the will of the owner,\" there was no question as to that in the evidence. The evidence was that the funds were wrongfully taken and converted.\nAs to count 4, obtaining money by false pretences, the statement of the law by the trial judge was sufficient to guide the jury in reaching a verdict so long as there was evidence to convict on such a charge.\nThe opinions of the Chief Justice and Davies J. are delivered by Anglin J. Dewart K.C. and Harding for the appellant\nJ. B. Coyne K.C. and R. W. Craig K.C. for the respondent.\nIdington J.\u2014This appeal arises out of a reserved case in which the learned trial judge had submitted to the court below seventeen questions. On the hearing of that appeal two of the learned judges hearing it, dissented, on points hereinafter referred to, from the judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nUnder the authorities cited in argument, including Reg. v. McIntosh[80]; Rice v. The King[81]; Gilbert v. The King[82]; Curry v. The King[83]; Eberts v. The King[84], at p. 26; Mulvihill v. The King[85], and other cases cited in the reports of these decisions, I do not think there can longer be a doubt that our jurisdiction to hear an appeal from a court of appeal in a criminal case is bounded by the lines of clear dissent on any point raised therein relative to any of the questions of law properly involved in the submission of the reserved case.\nA dissenting opinion relative to something outside that which can properly be made part of a reserved case or fails to bear upon the points of law properly involved in such case as reserved, can form no part of what we are concerned with.\nI respectfully submit that the expressions of the dissents herein are, as I read them, not clearly confined within these lines. For example: as regards the grounds taken relative to the questions raised by the matter in the address of counsel for the Crown I doubt if such an address can be in itself the subject of a reserved case. I shall presently deal at length with that subject and the arguments founded on what for brevity's sake I may call the conspiracy aspect of the case, when what I refer to will more fully appear. I merely desire here to submit, respectfully, that for want of that definite application of each dissent to the reserved question it relates to, or what the exact grounds are intended to be covered thereby, and as the dissents may have implied more than I might find appears, in order to avoid mistakes, I shall proceed to deal consecutively with each question in the whole reserved case. I am not, therefore, to be assumed as departing from what I have just now said of the limits of our own jurisdiction to act.\nThere is another boundary to our jurisdiction expressed in the language of sec. 1019 of the Criminal Code, which is as follows:\u2014\n1019. No conviction shall be set aside nor any new trial directed, although it appears that some evidence was improperly admitted or rejected, or that something not according to law was done at the trial or some misdirection given, unless, in the opinion of the court of appeal, some substantial wrong or miscarriage was thereby occasioned on the trial: Provided that if the court of appeal is of opinion that any challenge for the defence was improperly disallowed, a new trial shall be granted: 55-56 Vict. ch. 29, sec. 746.\nApplying this section enables me, for my part, to dispose of the case, without entering at length, and in minute detail, upon some of the nice questions which may be involved in the dissenting opinions.\nThere was a motion made by counsel for the appellant to quash the indictment, and refused by the learned trial judge.\nThe first six questions submitted concern the validity of this refusal and raise the further question of whether or not, if there be in any case an error therein, there was as a consequence thereof and the admission of objectionable evidence a mistrial.\nThere are six counts in the indictment. The sixth, which is for perjury, was, with the consent of the Crown, directed to stand over and not to be tried with the others. The fifth has been disposed of by the Court of Appeal.\nThe first and fourth are ordinary counts for theft and false pretences, respectively, and I fail to see how any serious question can have been raised as to them.\nThe second and third counts may be open to the criticism that they are of doubtful import, but as the first and fourth counts enabled the whole of the evidence to be given, which was properly admissible on the trial, there cannot now, in face of the section quoted above, be any question of serious import raised as to the validity of the learned judge's refusal to quash.\nThe attempt to use the particulars delivered ten days later than this motion to quash, illustrates how absurd this part of the contention in the case is.\nThe complaint made that the learned trial judge did not, in his charge, enter upon a specific attempt to deal in detail with, and direct the jury as to, each of these counts, and what they mean and might be held to imply, seems unfounded, for his mode of treatment left the appellant without any ground of complaint in regard thereto. Had he done as suggested I imagine there might have been some ground for suggesting that the minds of the jury had been thereby confused.\nThe case was presented by him in his charge as one of stealing, or receiving that stolen, or of obtaining by false pretences. He wisely abstained from needlessly entering upon such a field of mystification as we have had presented to us to deal with and hence his charge misled nobody.\nThere was at the close of the trial a distinct question put by the foreman of the jury which led the learned judge to tell the jury they could not bring in a verdict of guilty on both these second and third counts, but must, if either included in a verdict of guilty, select one or other thereof.\nTheir verdict was guilty on the first, second, fourth and fifth counts.\nThere was, therefore, no substantial wrong or miscarriage in the refusal to quash or in consequence thereof.\nAs to question 7, which is as follows:\u2014\n7. Was I right in my charge to the jury on the first count of the indictment as to theft or was my charge insufficient in law so as to be prejudicial to a fair trial of the accused?\nThere is raised thereby perhaps the most important and difficult question in the reserved case.\nThe learned judge relied upon section 347 of the Criminal Code and I think he was right in doing so. It is a most comprehensive definition of theft and is as follows:\u2014\n347. Theft or stealing is the act of fraudulently and without colour of right taking, or fraudulently and without colour of right converting to the use of any person, any thing capable of being stolen, with intent,\u2014\n(a) to deprive the owner, or any person having any special property or interest therein, temporarily, or absolutely, of such thing, or of such property or interest; or,\n(b) to pledge the same or deposit it as security; or\n(c) to part with it under a condition as to its return which the person parting with it may be unable to perform; or,\n(d). to deal with it in such a manner that it cannot be restored to the condition in which it was at the time of such taking and conversion.\n2. Theft is committed when the offender moves the thing or causes it to move or to be moved, or begins to cause it to become movable, with intent to steal it.\n3. The taking or conversion may be fraudulent, although effected without secrecy or attempt at concealment.\n4. It is immaterial whether the thing converted was taken for the purpose of conversion, or whether it was, at the time of the conversion, in the lawful possession of the person converting: 55-56 Vict., ch. 29, sec. 305.\n\"Anything capable of being stolen\" might not cover money in the bank to the credit of any person, but surely it does include a cheque to draw that money. I think a cheque being an order for money is a valuable security within the words of the indictment. Can it be said that the fraudulent means resorted to in order to induce the Lieutenant-Governor and others to do those acts which resulted in the preparation of the cheque and its due signature having preceded its existence, therefore the appellant guilty with others in bringing those acts about, can have acquired a colour of right to use it or convert it to his use?\nI think not, and that if the appellant by reason of his fraudulent acts was not entitled to have received any of the cheques issued to him, he had no right to convert them to his use.\nThey each remained the property of the Crown recoverable by respondent, if so advised, from appellant at any instant until passed into the hands of the bank without notice. The language of sub-sec. 4 seems clearly to bear this out and to cover just such cases as this.\nThe later sections dealing with what used to be called embezzlement are in harmony with this view. The evident purpose of the section, as a whole, was to make clear that the fraudulent nature of the dealing was to be the test of whether or not the wrongful conversion was to be treated as theft or not.\nCounsel for respondent in their factum suggest that the moneys had been stolen by the Minister and thereby there was a conversion of the money to which appellant was a party as accessory and hence he was liable as a principal.\nMy difficulty is in extending the section to a theft of money in the bank for it contemplates a taking which could not, I submit, be within the meaning of the section. The same counsel in, argument also submitted the amendment to the English \"Larceny Act\" in 1861, section 70, aimed at officers of the government, and that such amendment was introduced by the Act introducing English law into Manitoba.\nIn my view it is not necessary to pass any opinion upon this contention.\nIf appellant could be guilty of stealing the cheques, then there is no need for prosecuting the inquiry.\nThe eighth question seems upon the evidence hardly arguable.\nClearly there was an obtaining of money by false pretences whatever may be said of the other charges as a matter of law.\nThe ninth question, which is as follows:\n9. Was I right in admitting evidence as to acts, conduct, admissions, conversations and facts relating to some one or more of those named in the second count, namely: Rodmond P. Roblin, Walter H. Montague (since deceased), James H. Howden, George R. Coldwell, R. M. Simpson and Victor W. Horwood, to which the accused was not a party, and if I have erred, was the same prejudicial to a fair trial of the accused?\nraised at first, in argument, a doubt in my mind, when it was urged by counsel for appellant that the moneys obtained had all been obtained before the end of December, 1914, and the offences charged had then been completed and much of the evidence here in question related to later events.\nIt was alleged that what transpired later was in fact nothing but evidence of a new conspiracy and neither had nor could have had any direct relation to or be in any way a necessary result of the original conspiracy.\nIf the facts would justify this or some such way of looking at the admissibility of the later evidence I agree a grave question would have arisen. It is, however, quite clear when one is enabled by a knowledge of the evidence to grasp the actual situation that this contention of appellant is hardly worthy of serious consideration.\nThe Crown alleges in fact the existence of a conspiracy on the part of those named, or some of them, including the accused, to use the opportunity of the erection of the public buildings\u2014known as Parliament Buildings\u2014for the improper purpose of diverting funds ostensibly voted by the legislature for that purpose, and the property of the Crown as charged, into the hands of some one for the purpose of forming part of a political campaign fund, or possibly dividing or distributing amongst them, or some of them, moneys so diverted.\nIt matters not what the purpose was so long as moneys were, from time to time during the progress of such works, to be diverted from their proper purpose as designated by the legislature.\nThere was evidence that justified such an inference and it was of such weight as to entitle the Crown to have the whole relative thereto fully developed.\nTouching the mere questions of admissibility of such evidence the learned trial judge had to consider the nature of the charges either as alleged in the pleadings or presented by counsel for the Crown, and then the evidence already presented tending to support any such pretensions and determine whether in view of all that had preceded such later developments could reasonably be connected therewith.\nIn default of that being quite apparent from the case as developed, learned trial judges often, for convenience sake, have to rely upon the undertaking of the counsel presenting such like evidence that it will be connected with that preceding or to follow in such a way as to be relevant to the issues in question and maintain the contention put forward.\nThe mere technical questions of admissibility as presented in the question does not therefore go very far.\nIf, however, it should in such case turn out that the evidence could not be connected with other evidence in a way to form an arguable case, the consequences would have to be dealt with effectively to see that there was no miscarriage of justice. Here it is not merely the admissibility as that is put in the question that might have been involved.\nNot only was it contended that the evidence of the later acts I have referred to were inadmissible, but also that the whole evidence of conspiracy, or to put it in another and less controversial form, of agreement to act together in pursuance of the common purpose of diverting a part of the money appropriated for said buildings, so attacked was quite inadmissible unless appellant was present.\nI cannot assent thereto. Whatever our reason will maintain as fairly inferable from the circumstances presented must be the test. The accused, of course, must be so connected with those circumstances or part thereof as to justify, by that test, the maintenance of the inference argued for.\nBut, unfortunately for the appellant, his connection with the later developments has been shewn in fact to be so intimate and close that there is no need for straining the application of the principles I am relying upon to bring home to him the desire to destroy evidence and hinder its production and promote thereby the concealment of all that had transpired which might tend to shew him and others as having designed by their co-operation to divert and to have succeeded in diverting moneys from their destined purpose.\nAnd the desire to destroy, when existent in some bosoms, seems soon to produce destruction.\nIn each of the sections 69 and 70 of the Criminal Code there has been formulated a legislative guide expressive of the law which may be relied upon as an effective answer to all that has been put forward or that may be implied therein, in any way, bearing upon the many questions or many forms of the same question in contending against the use of anything done by others unless clearly and expressly directed by him.\nThe second sub-section of said section 69, is as follows:\u2014\n2. If several persons form a common intention to prosecute any unlawful purpose, and to assist each other therein, each of them is a party to every offence committed by any one of them in the prosecution of such common purpose, the commission of which offence was, or ought to have been known to be a probable consequence of the prosecution of such common purpose: 55-56 Vict., ch. 29, sec. 61.\nThe general and comprehensive declaration of the law binds and goes a long way to define what may be admitted in evidence in cases of this kind.\nIt is but a deduction of that which in reason, must necessarily open the way to the introduction of evidence, in order to lay before the court those circumstances, from which it may be reasonable to infer concurrence of action on the part of the accused in regard to what is in question.\nIt is quite clear from the evidence that though the moneys got had been paid before the end of December, 1914, yet the scheme, as a whole, was far from complete, and had been only interrupted by steps in the way of inquiry before a committee of the legislature, which seemed likely to lead to an exposure that would prevent its full fruition. Hence it became necessary for those concerned, actively led by the accused as commander of the forces as it were, to destroy evidence and keep witnesses out of the way. He had been paid far in excess of the work, done and was proceeding with further execution of the work. That payment, however, was a mere incident of all that had been planned.\nI have no doubt that all that which was introduced as evidence at the trial in the way complained of, in order to prove concealment of a fraudulent purpose in relation to said payments, was properly admissible and evidence from which proper inferences might be drawn tending to establish that purpose and the character thereof.\nI shall presently advert to another aspect of this question of conspiracy and its bearing on the case.\nQuestion. 10 seems, as put, hardly arguable.\nQuestion 11 seems of the same nature and to call for the same reply, for, as put, it does not indicate that there was any evidence adduced which bore only upon the third count and could have an improper bearing upon other counts.\nQuestion 12 was hardly pressed before us and I see no reason why such an affidavit should not be admitted under the circumstances. Moreover, the objection has no support in the dissenting opinions. On the contrary it is overruled in that of Mr. Justice Richards.\nThe same answer may be made as to questions 13 and 14 save that the learned judges dissenting made no observation anent same.\nQuestion 15 is as follows:\u2014\n15. Was I right in my comments upon the statement of the accused to the jury, with respect to it not being made under oath, and if so, was this prejudicial to a fair trial of the accused or a violation of the \"Canada Evidence Act?\" I desire to consider this and part of Question 17, together.\nIt seems difficult to understand how the proper remark of the learned trial judge can be construed as an infringement of the \"Evidence Act.\"\nIt may be quite permissible for the accused, when undefended, to state his version of what has been given in evidence in order to bring home to the minds of the jurors the possibility that the evidence as it stands or, either by reason of the way in which it has been presented in the giving thereof or the summing up of Crown counsel may mislead, and by his statement induce a reconsideration of anything so tending. Any misleading construction put upon it to the detriment of the accused may thereby be cured.\nWhen the accused in his address chooses to present his version and adds thereby something in way of statement of fact relevant to that which is properly before the jury, they are not only entitled but bound to consider what the accused has said including his statement of alleged fact.\nBut they, when considering same, can only properly consider it in the way of an explanation which may induce them to turn their minds towards the evidence which has been sworn to and see if as a whole it can properly bear the interpretation which the statement of fact made by the accused suggests as a possibility.\nIf on the evidence it cannot properly be so understood their duty is to discard the statement entirely for it is not evidence. That is in substance the effect of what the learned trial judge told them and therefore, his charge is in that regard unobjectionable.\nThe learned judge undoubtedly erred as he suggests, in allowing the accused to wander far beyond the issues and introduce topics and allege statements of pretended fact which had nothing to do with the simple issues of fact properly before the court. No one had the slightest right to do so, and above all things to make charges against or to insult opposing counsel by dragging in something as the accused did, which had nothing to do with the issues being tried.\nIf the accused dispensed with counsel, as quite possibly he did, in hopes of being allowed to drag in by way of his address something which was not permissible and what no counsel could or would venture upon doing, it is to be regretted he was permitted the measure of success he got.\nAs I gather from the learned judge's charge he felt he had erred and tried to rectify it by pointing out that statements of the accused in an address are not evidence and are not to be treated as such. He would have erred if he had failed under such circumstances in making plain as he did the law on the subject.\nQuestion sixteen is as follows:\u2014\n16. Similarly were any of the observations of counsel for the Crown so inflammatory or improper as to prejudice the fair trial of the accused or to be a violation of the \"Canada Evidence Act?\"\nThe question as presented does not, I incline to think, put forward any question of law and hence is beyond that which we are entitled to act upon. It is put forward, however, at great length and, if I may be permitted to say so, given undue prominence.\nWe have presented in appellant's factum extracts culled from an address which occupies twenty-five printed pages of the appeal book. It is not difficult when such extracts are taken from their context to try and create an unpleasant impression. Some of these extracts are unfair presentations of what was intended.\nThe late Sir James Stephen, in his History of the Criminal Law of England, vol. 1, p. 429, deals with the question of Crown counsel addresses, and there says:\u2014\nIt is very rare to hear arguments pressed against prisoners with any special warmth of feeling or of language; one reason for which no doubt is, that any counsel who did so would probably defeat his own object.0 Apart, however, from this, it is worthy of observation that eloquence either in prosecuting or defending prisoners is almost unknown and unattempted at the bar. The occasion seldom permits of it, and the whole atmosphere of English courts in these days is unfavourable to anything like an appeal to the feelings\u2014though, of course, in particular cases, topics of prejudice are introduced.\nSome few things said by counsel in summing up perhaps transgress these traditions of the English bar.\nBut wherein exists the question of law raised?\nIt certainly does not appear in the question sixteen or in these extracts as self evident.\nI am not prepared to lay down as law that out of a Crown counsel's address there cannot arise ground for a reserved case.\nI can imagine a case (such as does not exist here) of counsel misstating the law and the fact in such terms as to call for the prompt interference of the trial judge, and for his rectification of any wrong done thereby, by warning and directing the jury not to be misled thereby.\nIt is not the misstatements in the address which alone can furnish ground for a reserved case upon a point of law, but those coupled with failure on the part of the learned trial judge to see such errors rectified, that, in my opinion, can constitute grounds for a reserved case. In such event the least that should be required is a statement in the reserved case concisely setting forth exactly what is complained of. A general suggestion such as put in questions 16 and 17 does not satisfy what should be required. It does not seem to me that we have here any such definite statement of what is in question as the statute requires to be set forth in a stated case reserved for the appellate court.\nIn any event we are here confined to what appears in the dissenting opinions.\nMr. Justice Richards selects the criticism by the Crown counsel of the failure of the accused to be defended by counsel. The whole of the episode and real or affected resentment because a postponement of more than two weeks for preparation by counsel was refused deserved severe criticism. And I am not prepared to find any legal ground for interference merely because the language in which it was couched might have been better chosen, when the conduct in question deserved some observations from both Crown counsel and the learned trial judge to have been passed upon it. A firm, temperate rebuke was in order if respect for the bench is to be maintained.\nMr. Justice Richards further selects the misstatement of the law by the Crown counsel as to the crimes charged in the indictment, but, as I most respectfully submit, it may be my misfortune that my own view rather accords with that in substance which I take it was intended to be presented by the Crown counsel rather than what Mr. Justice Richards holds. I hardly think we can make much of that complaint.\nAgain he selects the expression as to accused thinking himself to be guilty. As I read the address it contains two pages of evidence quoted by counsel attempting to demonstrate in a fairly arguable manner that such is the inference to be drawn from the evidence quoted.\nCounsel certainly on this occasion and others should not have stated, as he did, his own opinion, instead of making a submission of his contention for consideration by those addressed.\nI am not prepared to hold that there was any substantial wrong or miscarriage created either thereby or by the omission of the learned trial Judge to specifically call attention to the error and warn the jury against it.\nThe remaining passages, selected by Mr. Justice Richards as the subject of observation, seem to me of the character which (as Sir James Stephen remarks in the quotation above) would tend to defeat counsel's object.\nI am quite sure the matters with which they deal could have been presented in a calm, lucid way that would have carried more weight with the jury and had a crushing effect, if the evidence is to be believed, beyond anything that is complained of.\nAnd hence I fail to find that the omission of the learned trial judge to specifically deal therewith in each phase thereof, furnishes a reason to believe there has been any substantial wrong or miscarriage.\nI repeat it is only by virtue of such omissions that a question of law can arise.\nThe learned trial judge's charge was fair and in general terms covered all that is gathered thus from the address of counsel.\nMr, Justice Haggart assigns nothing further on this question than that already referred to by Mr. Justice Richards.\nIn parting with this part of the case I think it is due to Mr. Coyne to say that whatever may be said or thought of the error in the mode of address used by his leader in summing up, he ought not to have been attacked, as he has been, for he was doing no more than his duty in repudiating what accused improperly dragged into the case.\nI cannot think that under the circumstances the granting of a new trial, by reason of anything that is thus complained of, would conduce to the due administration of justice.\nThere remains for consideration the objection taken by Mr. Justice Richards in one form, and by Mr. Justice Haggart in another, relative to the charge of conspiracy alleged to be made in the second and third counts of the indictment and all bearing thereupon or flowing therefrom. These counts cannot, I submit, be held to be in law an indictment for conspiracy.\nThey are, by the express language used, clearly intended to be charges against the accused, of unlawfully receiving money, valuable securities or other property, belonging to the respondent which had been stolen by means of a conspiracy.\nHow can that be pretended to be a count framed to charge a conspiracy? If nothing had been adduced in evidence but that tending to establish a conspiracy and on the trial all reference to its successful accomplishment had been omitted, would any court or judge listen long to a prosecuting counsel professing to desire the charge of conspiracy to be submitted on such a count to a jury and proposing to ask them to find the accused guilty of conspiracy? I venture to think no judge could be got to assent to such a proposition.\nIt seems to me this is the proper test to apply to what is suggested and elaborately argued relative to the infringement of the Extradition Treaty under which the accused was surrendered.\nSo tested, there is not a single ground upon which in reason or authority the claim to exclude evidence because it would tend to prove a conspiracy, can be maintained.\nAgain, suppose the words\nby means of an unlawful conspiracy by fraudulent means of Thomas Kelly aforesaid, Rodmond P. Roblin, Walter H. Montague (since deceased), James H. Howden, George R. Coldwell, R. M. Simpson, Victor H. Horwood and others unknown to defraud His Majesty\nhad been omitted from each of these second and third counts and each then stood as a count in the ordinary form of obtaining money or valuable securities, or property by false pretences, and it had been attempted to prove exactly what has been proven and no one ever used the word \"conspiracy\" but the facts were offered to conclusively establish the means whereby the wrongs complained of had been accomplished, would any trial judge rule out any of the evidence? On what ground could he?\nThe charge is, in this amended count I suggest, that the money, or securities, or property had been theretofore stolen. The means used is not stated in the amended form I suggest. How could the judge be asked to reject the evidence? Would he listen to, or give effect to, the argument that it had unexpectedly been disclosed that the accused was one of those who had counselled the original crime of theft and therefore he could not be convicted of unlawfully receiving that which he was an accessory to the stealing of?\nThe fact is notorious that in many criminal circles there exist men who act as fences. Could such a man secure his acquittal on a charge of receiving stolen goods, by proving that he had directed those usually doing the actual stealing and bringing him the goods, to take these goods in question from some one he had pointed out? Such proof would constitute him a principal liable to be found guilty of the theft.\nWhoever supposed that because it had this or in some such way developed that the man accused of receiving stolen goods was in fact liable to be charged as a principal, he would be entitled to his acquittal?\nSince when has it been law that a man indicted for a minor offence can claim acquittal on any such theory?\nI have always supposed that the Crown was entitled to prosecute for that of which a man was clearly guilty even if he was suspected of being liable to be held for a higher or greater offence and a diligent inquiry might produce evidence thereof.\nWhatever might be the duty of a. Crown officer under such circumstances can have no bearing upon the legal result.\nThe Crown is entitled to lay the charge for whatever is deemed appropriate to the evidence at hand. And if tried for that for which the Crown has so chosen to indict him, the accused can never again be arraigned and tried for another offence upon the same facts.\nThose apprehensive that the accused might suffer wrong by reason of such a proceeding will be relieved by a perusal of those parts of Archbold's Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice (22 ed.) pp. 150 et seq. where the work deals with the subjects of autrefois acquit and autrefois convict, and cites the numerous authorities on the subject.\nSo much for the possible wrong or miscarriage.\nMoreover does it not seem idle to argue about the wrong done by a suggested possibility of these counts containing more than one charge, in face of the provisions for inserting in one indictment any number of offences and only one or two, but none of these, are excepted from being so dealt with. Then again we have the further provisions contained in section 951, of which the first sub-section is as follows:\u2014\n951. Every count shall be deemed divisible; and if the commission of the offence charged, as described in the enactment creating the offence or as charged in the count, includes the commission of any other offence, the person accused may be convicted of any offence so included which is proved, although the whole offence charged is not proved; or he may be convicted of an attempt to commit any offence so included.\nThis alone should be held to cover all the objections revolving around these two counts and dispose of all except the conspiracy question already dealt with and about to be referred to. Though the section just quoted and others give wide scope for acting under in order to relieve trials from the danger of being wrecked by some mere play upon words or trifling frivolities so dear to the hearts of ancient pleaders now dead, the duty remains to have it kept clear during the trial what the court is about to try and is trying an accused for.\nNot only as I submit was there no doubt in this case in the minds of any one, but special pains were taken by counsel for the Crown and the learned trial judge to make clear that there was no charge of conspiracy made by the indictment, and the only reference made thereto was part of the inducement in the pleadings explaining the means whereby the crimes charged were accomplished. I imagine no juryman in Manitoba was ever stupid enough to fail to understand what he was thus told.\nTo meet some points pressed upon us though not open for action as I read the reserved case, I may add a few sentences and cite some precedents covering things so urged or pointed at. Even the question of a man being charged with receiving that which he might not only be charged with having stolen but was in fact guilty of, is covered by authority in the case of Reg, v. Hughes[86].\nThere might have been raised a more arguable case than some parts of this one on the ground of the verdict of guilty being entered for both the theft and the receiving of that stolen inasmuch as the punishments respectively assigned to such offences are not the same. Counsel for appellant seemed to think some such question was raised and put it forward in several ways. The case of Rex v. Darley[87] and other cases referred to in Chitty's Criminal Law (18 ed.), when dealing with the law as it stood one hundred years ago, suggest the contention would have been unavailing.\nWhat could be dealt with in a practical common sense fashion under the state of law then cannot surely furnish obstacles to the execution of justice now in view of the effort made by the legislature to remove such like barriers from the successful administration of justice and reduce all that is involved to the simplicity so much to be desired.\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nDuff J.\u2014There was, I think, no evidence to support a conviction on the charge of theft. In each case the authorities having custody on behalf of the Crown of the moneys paid to Kelly intended to pass the property in these very moneys to Kelly. Except as to the contention advanced on behalf of the Crown to which I am about to refer, it is sufficient to say that touching this branch of the appeal I adopt the reasoning of Mr. Justice Richards.\nThe answer to the learned judge's reasoning put forward by counsel for the Crown appears in the following extract from the factum:\u2014\nMr. Justice Richards errs in holding that count 1 of the indictment is negatived by the evidence. He apparently looks at the count as charging Kelly with actually himself stealing or embezzling the moneys. He apparently overlooks Kelly's position as an accessory before the fact to misappropriation of the public funds by the ministers. If he does not overlook this, then his view must be based on a restricted view of the definition of theft in the Criminal Code, sec. 347, which would limit the operation of that section to the taking of anything capable of being stolen, all the cases cited by him being judgments dealing with the question of the offence of larceny at common law. This leaves out of consideration theft by conversion under this section, which is committed whenever a person already in possession of personal property, with the owner's consent, fraudulently and without colour of right converts it to his own use or to the use of any other person than the owner of it with intent to deprive the owner of such property, or so to deal with it that it cannot be restored. The contention of the Crown is, and the evidence shews, that the cheques upon the funds of His Majesty the King in the right of the Province of Manitoba, and the moneys subsequently paid on those cheques were received under circumstances that constituted a theft or embezzlement by Messrs. Roblin, Coldwell, Howden and Montague in combination with Messrs. Kelly, Simpson and Horwood. To this Kelly contributed by being an accessory before the fact, and is therefore in law a principal in the commission of the offence, under sec. 69 of the Criminal Code, by reason of which there is no longer any distinction between a principal and an accessory before the fact.\nSee. Crankshaw, p. 72:\u2014\n\"A principal may be the actual perpetrator of the act, that is, the one who, with his own hands or through an innocent agent, does the act itself; he may be one who, before the act is done, does or omits something for the purpose of aiding some one to commit it; he may be one who is present aiding and abetting another in the doing of it; or he may be one who counsels or procures the doing of it, or who does it through the medium of a guilty agent.\"\nThe assumption underlying this argument is that the Ministers Roblin, Coldwell, Howden and Montague being in possession of moneys of the Crown could be convicted of unlawful conversion of the moneys under section 347 of the Criminal Code. When pressed for evidence that these moneys were in the possession of these ministers in contemplation of law, that is to say, within the meaning of the enactment relied upon, counsel were unable to point to any evidence of such possession. The fallacy of the argument lies in taking it for granted that the political (as distinguished from legal) control of the machinery of administration which, subject in the last resort to the authority of the Lieutenant-Governor, rested in the hands of these persons was equivalent in law to such possession and that in putting such machinery in motion, which they were able to do by falsifying the facts and thereby enabling Kelly to procure the moneys in question, they were guilty of the criminal offence of conversion within the contemplation of section 347.\nThe point may be illustrated by reference to the moneys paid under authority of orders-in-council. It was argued that as these ministers, or some of them, constituted a majority of the executive on whose advice the orders were passed, their acts in procuring the passing of them, and indirectly, by means of the orders, the issue of cheques payable to Kelly amounted to \"conversion\" in point of law.\nBut in truth these moneys were the moneys of His Majesty lawfully disbursable only on the order of His Majesty's representative, the Lieutenant-Governor (acting it is true on the advice of his Executive Council) and by the instrumentality of cheques signed by certain permanent officials, one of them being the Auditor. The moneys were in the possession of the Crown subject to disposition only by following a procedure prescribed by law; and though the advice of the Executive was a necessary part of this procedure, it was by no means the whole of it. Nor were the other essential acts, such for example as the concurrence of the Lieutenant-Governor which in these cases was obtained by deceiving him as to the facts of a character so purely ministerial as to justify the conclusion that these moneys were in law under the control of the ministers as depositaries. The truth is that, in law, the function of these persons was advisory only, the effective executive acts were the acts of others.\nThis is, of course, not to say that the conduct of Roblin and his associates, regard being had to their obligations as holders of high public office, was not (leaving out of view the law relating to conspiracy and obtaining money under false pretences) such conduct as the law notices and punishes as criminal under another head or other heads than theft.\nThe charge of receiving moneys knowing that such moneys had theretofore been embezzled, stolen or fraudulently obtained also, in my opinion, fails for the reason that up to the moment when the moneys in question were \"received\" by Kelly they remained in possession of the Crown and had not up to that moment been \"obtained\" by anybody not entitled to have them. The appellant is consequently entitled to have the conviction against him in respect of count No. 1 and count No. 2 quashed as being unsupported by evidence.\nMr. Coyne, as counsel representing the Crown, quite properly stated in the argument that the Crown submitted to the judgment of the Court of Appeal being treated as if it provided under section 1020 of the Criminal Code that the penalty should be limited to the lowest maximum, penalty allowed by law to be imposed as the result of a conviction on the first, second and fourth counts.\nI have nevertheless expressed my opinion upon the points above discussed because that, as I think, is due in strict justice to the appellant. In a court of morals no difference may be perceptible between the crime charged in the first count and that charged in the fourth count; yet the law does (as the difference in severity of the penalties attached to these crimes respectively demonstrates) regard the first mentioned offence as much the graver and it is right I think to state my opinion that of the graver offence he could not properly be convicted.\nBefore coming to the crucial questions relating specifically to the conviction on count number four it is convenient to deal with the objection (which might have been a formidable one if founded in fact) that the trial as actually conducted was in truth a trial for conspiracy\u2014a non-extraditable offence. The objection has no sub-stratum of fact. The officers of the Crown were entitled; and indeed it was their duty, in the circumstances, to bring before the jury all facts legally admissible in evidence which might tend to establish the fraud charged to the satisfaction of the jury. The design and the concerted action in furtherance of it were rightly proved and emphazised\u2014not for the purpose of obtaining a conviction for conspiracy as a substantive offence\u2014but as establishing the responsibility of Kelly for certain acts and as exhibiting the character and operation of the dishonest scheme which, as the Crown alleged, disclosed the criminal intent that was an essential ingredient in the offence charged under any of counts one, two or four.\nThe appellant asks for a new trial in respect of the fourth count of the indictment on the ground that the law was departed from at the trial in (1) comments alleged to have been made on his failure to testify on his own behalf; (2) the reception of inadmissible evidence; (3) unfairness of the trial in respect of extreme and inflammatory observations by counsel for the Crown.\nAs to the first of these grounds I can find nothing, which, when fairly construed, amounts to such comment within the meaning of the statutory prohibition.\nAs to the second ground (which was also put in the form of an objection that the learned judge failed to point out to the jury the evidence admissible under counts one and two that would not be admissible under count four) the only exception requiring comment is that relating to evidence of acts which were done after the last of the payments in question had been made (December, 1914), and to which Kelly was not proved to be an immediate party. Kelly it is said could not be held to be a party to these acts indirectly or constructively by reason of the conspiracy proved to obtain these moneys by fraud, as the object of that conspiracy was completely accomplished when the last payment was made. This objection is not, I think, well founded. These acts it was argued with a great deal of force (and I am inclined to think the argument is sound) which were concerned with measures for the prevention of discovery and disclosure were well within the original design. But be that as it may there is sufficient evidence of concert in preventing discovery and disclosure to establish a subsidiary conspiracy in which Kelly was involved with that as its object; and acts done in furtherance of such a conspiracy would be admissible in support of the charge of mens rea.\nAs to all these alleged grounds for granting a new trial it should be observed that the jurisdiction of the court of Crown cases reserved in Manitoba as well as the jurisdiction of this court in criminal appeals is derived from statute and that in exercising that jurisdiction both courts are strictly bound by the rule that no new trial can be granted unless there has been some error, by which \"some substantial wrong or miscarriage\" has been occasioned \"on the trial\" (Crim. Code, sec. 1019).\nThe guilt of the appellant as regards the offence charged by the fourth count (obtaining money by false pretences) is demonstrated by evidence indisputably admissible No jury directing its attention exclusively to that evidence could, unless bent upon not giving effect to the law, have failed to find a verdict of guilty on that count.\nIn these circumstances there was obviously no \"miscarriage;\" and assuming there was some technical \"wrong\" there can be in my judgment no \"substantial wrong\" from the admission of inadmissible evidence if it must be affirmed that relatively to the whole mass of admissible evidence that which is open to exception is merely negligible and that in the absence of it the verdict could not have been otherwise. This conclusion is in no way inconsistent with the acceptance of the criterion suggested in Makin's Case[88], at pages 70 and 71. In such a case the impeached evidence cannot in any practical sense be supposed \"to have had any influence upon the verdict.\"\nAs to the ground numbered three upon which a new trial is prayed it may be added that although some of the observations of the learned Crown counsel were no doubt excessively heightened, it is impossible to think that in the circumstances of this case the accused could suffer in consequence of them. Such expressions could not deepen the effect of a bare recital of the facts in the story which the officers of the Crown had to put before the jury.\nThe opinion of the Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Davies and Mr. Justice Anglin was delivered by\nAnglin J.\u2014Although the conviction of the appellant on three distinct counts in an indictment\u2014No. 1, for theft, No. 2 for receiving, and No. 4 for obtaining money by false pretences\u2014was upheld by a majority of the learned judges of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, the Chief Justice, as we understand with the concurrence of Mr. Justice Perdue and Mr. Justice Cameron, said (35 West. L.R. 57):\u2014\nIt is difficult to see how the accused should for one crime be found guilty on the first, second and fourth counts. That he has committed a crime seems by the evidence to be clearly established, and it is perhaps best established under the fourth count.\nI assume that the trial judge in pronouncing sentence will consider that the accused was found guilty of but one crime, and in considering the maximum sentence allowed by law I think he should be guided by the lowest maximum fixed by law for either of the three crimes set forth in the first, second and fourth counts.\nThis course being taken, I do not think such substantial wrong or miscarriage was occasioned at the trial as would justify a new trial under sec. 1019 of the Code.\nThere seems no necessity to interfere with the finding of guilty on the inconsistent counts. He was certainly guilty of one of them and as he will be punished on one only, I would follow the course taken in Rex v. Lockett[89].\nThe formal judgment of the court, however, does not direct that the penalty to be imposed shall be so limited; but Mr. Coyne, while vigorously insisting that the conviction on all three counts should be sustained, stated at bar in this Court that, as counsel representing the Crown, he submitted to the judgment of the Court of Appeal being dealt with as if it contained a provi- sion under section 1020 of the Criminal Code limiting the penalty as indicated by the learned Chief Justice.\nHaving regard to all the circumstances of the case, and especially to the possible embarrassment which may have been caused by the trial together of five separate counts, and to the fact that the learned trial judge, while he carefully defined each of the offences charged, deemed it advisable to abstain from instructing the jury as to the facts in evidence bearing upon each branch of the indictment, we think the position taken by counsel for the Crown eminently proper and that \"we ought to treat the verdict as a verdict on the lesser charge,\" namely, that of obtaining money by false pretences: Rex v. Norman[90], at page 343; Rex v. Lockett[91].\nOn this charge we find no dissent in the Court of Appeal on the two propositions; that the count itself was properly laid and that there was sufficient evidence to justify conviction upon it. The appellant urges as grounds for a new trial on this count, warranted by the opinions of the two dissenting judges, (a) that the conduct of the case may have given the jury the impression that the accused was on trial for conspiracy\u2014a non-extraditable offence; (b) alleged comment on the failure of the accused to testify on his own behalf; (c) inflammatory and improper observations of Crown counsel; (d) failure of the learned trial judge to direct the attention of the jury to evidence favourable to the accused and. to correct mis-statements of law by Crown counsel; and (e) the reception of inadmissible evidence and the failure of the learned judge to instruct the jury that certain evidence, though admissible on other counts, should not be considered in disposing of the fourth count.\nIf ground (a) is covered by any question in the reserved case, in view of the explicit and reiterated warning given to the jury by the trial judge (emphasizing similar statements made to them by counsel for the Crown and by the defendant himself) that \"the accused is not charged with conspiracy''\u2014\"What he is charged with is not conspiracy\"\u2014and again, \"Remember that it is not the direct charge he is answering\"\u2014it is impossible to accede to the suggestion that the jury may have been misled as to the offences really charged; (b) There was no comment whatever on the failure of the accused to testify. His right to do so was not mentioned during the trial. The learned judge merely discharged his duty in warning the jury against treating the statement which he had allowed the accused to make as the equivalent of sworn testimony; (c) Whether there is any question of law reserved on this point is, to say the least, questionable.\nBut without dwelling further on the several grounds urged, and without determining that in regard to any of them there has been such error in law as would, if \"some substantial wrong or miscarriage (had been) thereby occasioned on the trial\" (Crim. Code, sec. 1019), have entitled the appellant to a new trial, we are of the opinion that his guilt on the fourth count has been established by uncontradicted evidence, of which the admissibility upon that count has not been and could not be successfully challenged, so complete and so convincing that in regard to that count a substantial miscarriage on the trial is out of the question and the matters complained of, whether taken singly or cumulatively, are \"most unlikely to have affected the verdict:\" Ibrahim v. The King[92], at page 616, if indeed it is not impossible that they could have had any influence upon it: Makin v. Attorney-General of New South Wales[93].\nSo overwhelming is the proof furnished by the evidence not excepted to, that no honest jury could have returned other than a verdict of guilty of obtaining money by false pretences had the conduct of the case been entirely free from all the alleged errors of omission and commission. No substantial wrong was occasioned on the trial of the fourth count, and the conviction upon it, is in our opinion, unassailable.\nSince we also concur in the view of the learned Chief Justice of Manitoba that the punishment of the appellant should not exceed the maximum penalty which might be imposed had the conviction been upon the fourth count alone, the questions raised as to the first and second counts, to use the language of counsel for the Crown, have become academic. We therefore express no opinion upon them.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Richards, Sweatman, Kemp & Fillmore.\nSolicitor for the respondent: The Attorney-General for Manitoba.\n[1] 11 West.

Lockwood ((1894) A.C. 347) and Booth v. The King (51 Can. S.C.R. 20) referred to.\nA level crossing of the Intercolonial Railway had planking between the rails which raised the roadbed so that the tracks did not rise more than an inch above the surface of the highway. Under a regulation for the guidance of trackmasters and trackmen, made by the railway authorities, the planks were removed during the winter season to permit safe operation of snowploughs and fiangers, during this season the space occupied by the planking being filled by snow and ice. In April, before the use of snowploughs and flangers had been discontinued, the ice and snow melted and left the tracks about six inches above the roadbed. After the usual inspection by the trackmen, some unknown person placed a fence-rail against one of the tracks to assist sleighs over the obstruction and, later in the day, suppliant in driving his sleigh along the highway had his foot crushed between the fence-rail and the track and sought damages from the Crown for the injuries sustained:\u2014\nHeld, that the condition of the crossing constituted negligence of officers and servants of the Crown while acting within the scope of their duties and employment in the construction and maintenance of the railway in consequence of which the Crown was liable in damages notwithstanding that the resulting injury might not have occurred but for the intervening act of some unknown third person: Latham v. R. Johnson & Nephew ((1913), 1 K.B. 398), referred to.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, by which the suppliant's petition of right was dismissed with costs.\nThe circumstances of the case are stated in the head-note.\nLane K.C. and S. C. Riou K.C. for the appellant.\nR. V. Sinclair K.C. and L\u00e9o B\u00e9rub\u00e9 for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed.\nThe learned judge of the Exchequer Court in his notes of judgment says:\u2014\nIt is true that section 16 of the \"Government Railways Act\" provides that no part of the railway which crosses any highway shall rise or sink below the level of the highway more than one inch; but assuming that the track at the place in question did not absolutely comply with such requirement, it cannot be contended that it was the cause of the accident. Obviously the proximate, determining and effective cause of the accident was the encounter by the suppliant of the post upon the track and which is conceded by the pleadings to have been placed there by persons unknown. Had there been no post on the track there would have been no accident. The officers or servants of the Crown are not charged with having placed the pieu on the track, and no evidence whatsoever has been adduced to trace any negligent act on their part in that respect. The employees declare that if it had been there when they passed over the section in the morning they would have seen and removed it, and that is readily understood and believed. There might have been negligence on behalf of the employees if the evidence had established that the post had negligently remained on the track for several days or an unreasonable time.\nIt is quite certain, in fact it is practically admitted, that the rails at the highway crossing were laid in contravention of the statute, section 16, ch. 36, \"Government Railways Act,\" which provides that\nno part of the railway which crosses any highway, unless carried over by a bridge, or under by a tunnel, shall rise above or sink below the level of the highway more than one inch; and the railway may be carried across or above any highway subject to the provisions aforesaid,\nand were so laid as to create a nuisance.\nNot only did the Crown owe a duty to the suppliant to construct its line at the highway crossing in accordance with the provisions of the statute, but there was a clear breach of that duty for the consequences of which the Crown is liable unless the intervening act of some unknown third party in placing the round stick between the rails is, as the learned judge finds, a reason for saying that the plaintiff's injuries were not the result of the Crown's breach of duty. As was said in Crane v. South Suburban Gas Co.[1], at pages 37-8:\u2014\nThe intervention of a third party may break a link in the chain which connects the wrong and the injury resulting from the wrong if the intervention is the near cause of the injury, that is, if the original wrongdoer had no reason to contemplate the possibility of the intervention.\nBut it is part of the Crown's case that by reason of the height at which the rails were left above the level of the highway the practice had grown up of placing such round sticks between the rails. The learned judge\nsays:\u2014\nSome of the witnesses say there were often people travelling over the rails who would place round sticks of wood to enable them to cross easier, that they did it themselves, but that they usually removed those sticks of wood after passing.\nAs was said recently, people who create a dangerous nuisance on a highway will not save themselves by trying to divert the argument into refined discussion about negligence and intervening acts of third persons. This dangerous pactice should not have been tolerated and we cannot sanction the suggestion that as a result the Crown must escape liability.\nReference was made to the \"Rules and Regulations\" for the guidance of trackmasters and trackmen. But regulations cannot operate as amendments of the statute by virtue of which the crossing of a highway at rail level is permitted. A regulation may provide for something to be done consistent with the requirements of the statute, but it is not permitted, under guise of regulating the management and proper use and protection of Government Railways (sec. 46), to amend the statute which determines the conditions subject to which the railway may be carried across a highway at rail level.\nIdington J.\u2014There is no dispute as to the fact that appellant was seriously injured by reason of the road crossing the Intercolonial Railway being left in such a condition that someone, in order to get across the railway track, had resorted to the expedient of placing a stake between the rails in order that it would raise his sleigh above the rails and thus facilitate his crossing, and that stake being left there when appellant's team reached the same place rolled underneath the runners of his sleigh till it squeezed appellant's foot between it and the iron rail.\nThe learned trial judge holds that this does not furnish a cause of action. I cannot agree with such holding. I think the condition of things at the time and place in question must be looked at as a whole and the causes thereof inquired into and the crucial question asked, if in truth the violation of the statute which fixed the kind of crossing to be made and kept there by respondent was not the true cause of that whole condition of things and the only answer to be made to the question so put.\nThe \"Government Railways Act,\" by section 16, provides as follows:\u2014\n16. No part of the railway which crosses any highway, unless carried over by a bridge, or under by a tunnel, shall rise above or sink below, the level of the highway more than one inch; and the railway may be carried across or above any highway subject to the provisions aforesaid.\nThe railway in question at the time of the accident shewed the rails exposed five inches instead of one inch above the level of the highway, and thereby rendered it almost if not altogether impossible for loaded sleighs to cross such a barrier without those in charge thereof resorting to some such expedient as someone evidently had resorted to in placing a stake or other like material to help in crossing the iron rails.\nThis condition of things was so well known that counsel for respondent sets forth in his factum herein the fact and alleges it was well known to appellant.\nHe seeks to justify this by some regulations which I hold cannot override the statute. Indeed, so far as I can see, there is nothing in the statute authorising the making of regulations which can in any way support or justify any regulation tending to suggest such an interference with the highway and violation of the statute.\nThe apparently notorious fact of teamsters being compelled to resort to such an expedient and habitually leaving the material so used on the railway track and highway renders the answer made of want of notice futile. A municipality if responsible for the continuation of such a state of things could not plead want of notice.\nThe allegation that the railway sectionmen removed such things when found by them, and that the track was clear or made clear when they came to work in the morning and that it was cleared on the morning in question, cannot avail much when it is quite clear that there was good sleighing on the highway on either side of the track but none over it on the 3rd April, the day of the accident.\nIndeed at that time of the year, as any and every foreman must have known, the likelihood of someone adopting the only and well-known expedient in question in the course of a few hours ought to have induced him to restore the track to a travellable condition.\nThe plan of throwing a few shovels full of snow on the track in early morning to be melted away long before noon at that season of the year, seems but an idle trifling with the travellers on the highway who had a right to see the statute observed and whether observed or not to enjoy an easy and safe way to cross the railway provided by respondent.\nThe accident took place between twelve and one o'clock in the day time. What might have happened in the course of the night in such a case is not pleasant to contemplate.\nThose who act in such a way as the servants of respondent did in regard to this crossing cannot be held to have discharged their duty.\nTheir conduct in this case was just such negligence within the scope of their duty as caused the injury to the appellant of which he complains, and for which the statute provides the remedy invoked herein. The suggestion made in the respondent's factum that the appellant well knew the conditions with which he was confronted, and ought to have waited till an approaching train had passed and then picked up this wood off the track and avoided the possible accident, and that his failure to do so should be held contributory negligence, comes with rather a bad grace from respondent.\nThat phase of the case is not dealt with by the learned trial judge beyond saying appellant might have waited.\nExperience teaches us that a team of horses is much easier managed when across the track than facing it to see a passing train, and the fair inference is that appellant in crossing was exercising due caution.\nThe damages are not assessed and in my view that the appeal should be allowed with costs throughout the case must go back to the learned trial judge for the assessment of damages unless the parties can as they ought to agree upon the amount.\nDuff J.\u2014There are two questions for decision on this appeal. First: Has the suppliant proved that the injury suffered by him was \"caused by the negligence of\" some\nofficer or servant of the Crown while acting within the scope of his duties or employed upon, in or about the construction, maintenance or operation of the Intercolonial Railway\n(sub-sec. f, sec. 20, Exchequer Court Act as amended by 9 & 10 Edw. VII. ch. 19)? Secondly, assuming the injuries were so caused in the sense that some such negligence was a causa sine qua non, is it the proper conclusion that such negligence was not a juridicial cause in view of the circumstance that the suppliant would probably have escaped injury had it not been for the intervening act of some other person or persons for whose conduct the Government is in no way responsible?\nThe Intercolonial Railway crosses a public road, near Cacouna Station, and on the day on which the appellant suffered the injury in respect of which he claims reparation (3rd April, 1913), the highway at the crossing being bare of snow and ice, the railway rose above the level of the highway to the extent of about five inches, thus constituting a considerable obstruction. Somebody had placed a post between the rails with the object, it may be assumed, of reducing the inconvenience due to the obstruction and facilitating the use of the crossing for the passage of sleighs. The appellant, walking beside his sleigh loaded with deals which his son was driving over the tracks, had his foot caught between this post and one of the rails and severely crushed by the pressure of the sleigh.\nThere is sufficient evidence of negligence on the part of some \"officer or servant\" of the Crown \"acting in the scope of some duty or employment\" in connection with the Intercolonial Railway in the fact itself that at this place the railway rose above the surface of the highway to the extent mentioned. This conclusion rests upon section 16 of the \"Government Railways Act,\" ch. 36, R.S.C., 1906, which is in these words:\u2014\nSec. 16. No part of the railway which crosses any highway unless carried over by a bridge, or under by a tunnel, shall rise above or sink below the level of the highway more than one inch; and the railway may be carried across or above any highway subject to the provisions aforesaid: R.S. ch. 38, sec. 11.\nThe effect of this section appears to be that the Government authority having charge of the Government railways may rightfully carry the railway across a highway, but to this right, if the railway passes over by means of a level crossing, is attached the correlative duty to see that the railway does not rise above the level of the highway more than one inch; and this duty, I think, is a continuing duty resting upon the railway authority so long as the railway is maintained there. It was not, I think, incumbent upon the appellant, as suppliant, to name the particular servant or officer of the Crown alleged to be charged with the performance of this duty; it was enough, I think, to shew that the duty was undischarged. It may be presumed, if that be necessary to support the suppliant's case, that all necessary appointments had been made for carrying out the law.\nAll of which would appear to be sufficiently plain; but it is proper to notice an argument addressed to us on behalf of the Crown, which is that certain rules purporting to be made under section 49 of the \"Government Railways Act,\" require and sanction a practice which to some extent, it is said, modifies the rigour of section 16 and defines the duties of those responsible for the condition of highway crossings. Under this practice, at such crossings the rails are laid in such a way as to leave a difference in level between the natural surface of the highway and the top of the rails considerably greater than one inch. During the seasons in which the roads are free from ice and snow, this difference in level is reduced by raising the highway level by means of planks; in winter these planks are removed, the natural filling of snow or ice serving the same office. This is pursuant to No. 48 of certain \"Rules for the guidance of Trackmasters and Trackmen\" made professedly under the authority of section 49 of the \"Government Railways Act\" which is in these words:\u2014\nEn la saison propice, le chef d'equipe devra donner instructions a ses contre-ma\u00eetres de faire enlever des madriers pr\u00e8s des rails aux traverses de chemin pour permetter facilement les operations du \"flanger.\"\nThe \"flanger\" commonly used cannot be operated, it is said, while the highway and the rails are maintained at the relative levels prescribed by section 16; and, consequently, while the \"flanger\" is in operation it is not practicable to employ such means for reducing the inequality of levels. In the regulations placed before the learned trial judge, the rules of 1906, there is no specific provision requiring the highway to be planked; but the rules of 1893 contained this section:\nSec. 32. All public road-crossings must be either planked and securely spiked or paved with blocks or other suitable materials.\nThe argument based upon these rules is that, under the practice observed at the date of the accident, the \"flanger\" being still in operation it was the duty of those charged with the care of the track at the place named to keep the track clear and consequently, the existence of a state of things forbidden by section 16 cannot be imputed to them or any other officer or servant of the Crown for negligence\u2014the rules and regulations enacted and promulgated for their guidance by the Governor in Council having, it is affirmed, been observed not only in the letter but in the only way which was practicable, due regard being paid to the necessities of railway operation.\nThere is, however, it may be noted, no evidence that the only practicable method of clearing the track of snow is by the use of a \"flanger\" of such construction as to necessitate the removal of the planks during the operation of it; nor is there any evidence shewing it to be impracticable to retain the planks in place so long as the flanger is not actually passing over the highway.\nIn dealing with this argument it is necessary to consider the status of the rules in question relatively to section 16. Sections 49 and 50 are the provisions we have to apply. They are in these words:\u2014\nSec. 49. The Governor in Council may, from time to time, make such regulations as he deems necessary,\u2014\n(a) for the management, proper use and protection of all or any of the Government railways, including station houses, yards and other property in connection therewith;\n(b) for the ascertaining and collection of the tolls, dues and revenues thereon;\n(c) to be observed by the conductors, engine-drivers and other officers and servants of the Minister, and by all companies and persons using such railways;\n(d) relating to the construction of the carriages and other vehicles to be used in the trains on such railways: R.S., ch. 38, sec. 43.\nSec. 54. All such regulations made under this Act shall be taken and read as part of this Act: R.S., ch. 38, sec. 44.\nThe rules put before us would prim\u00e2, facie fall within the authority of either sub-section a or sub-section c of section 49. It may well be doubted, I think, whether it is the proper construction of these general provisions to hold that under them any regulation dealing with any matter falling strictly within the specific enactment of section 16 is not beyond the scope of these subsections. The language of the last clause of section 16 is emphatic, the authority to carry the railway across the highway being given subject to the proviso that the railway and the highway shall be maintained at the relative levels therein provided for: Grand Trunk Pacific Rway. Co. v. Fort William Land Investment Co.[2].\nIt is not, however, necessary to pass upon that question.\nFor the purposes of this judgment I assume the effect of section 54 to be that regulations made by the Governor in Council which are of such a nature as to fall within the ambit of section 49 when that section is read and construed without reference to other sections of the Act are, when passed, to be \"taken and read\" as part of the Act and that the authority of the Governor in Council to pass such regulations is incapable of being called judicially in question, I assume, in other words, that these regulations are to be treated as the House of Lords treated the rule which was in question in the Institute of Patent Agents v. Lockwood[3], at page 360. On that assumption it necessarily follows that if there is a conflict between one of the provisions of, the Act and one of the regulations passed under section 49 the question devolving for decision upon the court having the duty of applying the regulation is first: Which is the governing enactment, the section or the regulation? Lord Herschell in his judgment in the case just mentioned says (at page 360) that where such a conflict arises the enactment itself would probably be treated as supplying the governing consideration and the regulation subordinate to it. In view of the last clause of section 16 to which I have just alluded I see no difficulty in holding that in this case the regulation, in so far as it is inconsistent with section 16, must give way; or, as it is perhaps better to put it, the regulation must be read as subject to an implied proviso that nothing in it shall be considered to sanction a departure from section 16.\nIt follows that there was neglect of duty within the Exchequer Court Act, section 20, sub-section f.\nBut was this neglect of duty the \"cause\" of the suppliant's injury in the sense that the Crown is responsible for the consequences of it within the meaning of that Act? The rails, in the condition in which they were, constituted, as I have said, a not inconsiderable obstruction to traffic upon the highway. The natural consequence of the physical condition of the crossing\u2014and the consequence to be expected in view of the fact that upon this road there was the ordinary amount of travel\u2014was the very thing which happened, namely that somebody would endeavour to facilitate the passage of sleighs by some such device as that which was actually resorted to. This being so, the connection between the breach of the duty arising under section 16 and the appellant's injury is complete; the intervening act of the person who placed the post in the road does not interrupt the chain of causality. As Lord Justice Hamilton said in Latham v. R. Johnson & Nephew[4], at page 413, a person who in violation of duty leaves his property in a condition which may be dangerous to another may be answerable for the resulting injury, even though but for a further intervening act of a third person that injury would not have occurred. The conditions of responsibility under section 20 of the \"Exchequer Court Act\" are therefore fulfilled and the suppliant is entitled to redress. I agree that the more convenient course is to refer the proceedings back to the Exchequer Court for the assessment of the damages.\nAnglin J.\u2014The plaintiff was injured at a highway level crossing of the Intercolonial Railway on the 3rd of April, 1913. The planking usually placed between and immediately outside the rails at such crossings had been removed for the winter season and had not yet been replaced. The snow and ice, which during the greater part of the winter fill up the space or depression left by the removal of the planking, between and outside the rails, had been thawed by the heat of the Spring sun, thus leaving the rails projecting some six or seven inches, it is said, above the level of the \"highway. No doubt to facilitate driving across the railway, some person had, earlier in the day, placed a log or fence rail between the tracks and had left it there. The plaintiff, when taking his heavily laden sleigh across, walked beside it. The runners of the sleigh instead of mounting the log or fence rail pushed it forward and the plaintiff's foot was caught between it and the projecting rail, thus causing the somewhat serious injury of which he complains.\nThe obligation imposed by section 16 of the \".Government Railways Act,\" R.S.C., ch. 36, that:\u2014\nNo part of the railway which crosses any highway unless carried over by a bridge, or under by a tunnel, shall rise above or sink below the level of the highway more than one inch,\nis absolute and unqualified. The carrying of the railway across the highway is made subject to this condition. It appears from the judgment of Mr. Justice Audette that section 22 of the rules and regulations for the guidance of trackmasters and trackmen passed in 1893, which, however, I do not find in the case before us, provided that\nAll public road crossings must be either planked and securely spiked or paved with blocks or other suitable material.\nThis regulation was presumably made in compliance with the obligation imposed by section 16 of the statute. No such provision is found in the rules and regulations for employees of Government railways, of 1906, put in at the trial, which, however, by Rule No. 20, require that section-foremen shall see that crossings of public roads are kept in good condition and are not obstructed. Rule No. 48 directs that the chief of equipment shall at the proper season give instructions to his foremen to cause the planking next to the rails on highway crossings to be removed in order to permit flangers to operate easily. The book of rules and regulations put in, as exhibit A., does not shew upon its face, not do I find in the record any evidence, that the rules and regulations which it contains were made under section 49 of the \"Government Railways Act,\" which empowers the Governor in Council to make regulations:\u2014\n(a) for the management, proper use and protection of all or any of the Government railways including station houses, yards and other property in connection therewith,\nand\n(c) to be observed by the conductors, engine drivers and servants of the Minister and by all companies and persons using such railways.\nIn dealing with this case, however, I shall treat Rule No. 48 as within section 54 of the statute which enacts that\nAll such regulations made under this Act shall be taken and read as part of this Act.\nUnder sections 73 and 74 of the statute the contravention of rules so authorized is penalized.\nThat the rails on the crossing projected several inches above the level of the highway when the plaintiff was injured was conceded and counsel for the Crown sought to justify the existence of this state of affairs by invoking Rule No. 48, to which I have referred. He also relied upon evidence to the effect that the use of snowploughs carrying an apron in front required the removal of the planking at such crossings midway between the rails as well as immediately next to them. A flanger had been used upon the crossing as recently as the 28th of March and there is evidence that its use was sometimes required in the month of April. Under these, circumstances, if regulation No. 48 justified the planking being kept up until the season had so far advanced that the use of flangers and snowploughs was not likely to be further required, I would be disposed to agree with the contention of the respondent that failure to replace the planking before the 3rd of April could not be regarded as negligence. But no regulation, although passed by the Governor in Council under section 49, can be allowed to override the explicit requirement of section 16 of the statute. If no construction can be placed upon regulation No. 48 which will bring it into harmony with that section, it cannot be regarded as having been made within the authority conferred by section 49, or, if so made, it must be treated as subordinate to the precise and definite prohibition of section 16. On the other hand it must if possible be given a construction which will not conflict with the statute: Booth v. The King[5]; Institute of Patent Agents, v. Lockwood[6], at page 360. So, dealing with regulation No. 48, I would be inclined to construe it as authorizing the section foremen to keep highway crossings without planks next to and between the rails only at such times and during such periods as the spaces which the planks ordinarily occupy are actually filled up by other material (snow and ice, or gravel) in such manner that at no time shall the rails project above the highway more than one inch. As already stated the obligation imposed by section 16 is absolute and unqualified, and the duty which it imposes is paramount. To a charge of a breach of that duty the regulation invoked does not afford an answer.\nI entertain no doubt that the omission to per- form such a duty is negligence in law. Negligence on the part of an officer or servant of the Crown while acting within the scope of his employment upon, in or about the construction, maintenance or operation of the Intercolonial Railway, causing death or injury or loss to the person or property, is actionable under section 20 (f) of the \"Exchequer Court Act\" (9 & 10 Edw. VII. ch. 19).\nThere remains the inquiry whether the negligence thus established was the cause of the injury sustained by the plaintiff. The learned assistant judge of the Exchequer Court reached the conclusion that it was not\u2014that that injury was rather attributable to the act of the person who had placed and left the log or fencerail between the rails. But it is obvious that if there had not been the space or depression between the rails it would not have been necessary to place the log there to facilitate crossing, and that, if so placed, it would not have caused the jamming of the plaintiff's foot between it and the rails. It was because the rail projected as it did several inches above the highway, quite as much as because the log or post had been placed where it was, that the plaintiff's foot was caught and jammed between the two. The placing of the log between the rails was no doubt a contributory cause of the accident; but certainly no more so, and probably not as much so, as the unlawful projection of the rails above the level of the highway. It follows that the negligence of its servant who was responsible for leaving the crossing in the condition in which it was renders the Crown liable: City of Toronto v. Lambert[7].\nAlthough there was a suggestion that the plaintiff was himself guilty of negligence which contributed to his injury, there has been no finding to that effect in the Exchequer Court and the evidence in my opinion does not warrant our making such a finding.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs in this Court and in the Exchequer Court. As there has been no assessment of plaintiffs damages and it would not be satisfactory that we should attempt to make that assessment upon the evidence in the record, unless the parties can come to an agreement as to the amount proper, to be allowed the case should be remitted to the Exchequer Court in order that the damages may be fixed. The learned assistant judge of that court saw the plaintiff and the witnesses and he is in a much better position than we are to determine either upon the evidence already taken, or upon additional evidence if he should deem it necessary, the amount the plaintiff should recover.\nBrodeur J.\u2014En vertu de la loi des chemins de fer de l'Etat, S.R.C. ch. 36, sec. 16, il est d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9 qu'aux traverses \u00e0 niveau des grandes routes le chemin de fer ne doit pas s'\u00e9lever au-dessus ni s'abaisser au-dessous du niveau de cette route de plus d'un pouce.\nPour remplir les exigences de cette disposition statutable on met sur l'Intercolonial des madriers entre les rails afin que les voitures puissent facilement traverser la voie.\nMais, par; contre, on avait Phabitude en hiver, \u00e0 Cacouna, o\u00f9 l'accident en question dans cette cause a eu lieu, d'enlever ces madriers et de laisser une cavit\u00e9 de quatre \u00e0 cinq pouces de profondeur. Tant que la neige subsistait il n'en r\u00e9sultait aucun inconv\u00e9nient mais au printemps, lorsque la neige \u00e9tait fondue, les voitures d'hiver qui circulaient sur la route \u00e9prouvaient les plus grandes difficult\u00e9s et des particuliers parfois jetaient entre les rails des pieux pour faciliter le passage des traineaux.\nL'appelant le 3 avril, 1913, arriva pour traverser la voie \u00e0 Cacouna et il y avait un pieux qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9 l\u00e0 par des mains inconnues. Sa voiture \u00e9tait charg\u00e9e et il eut beaucoup de difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 pouvoir traverser la voie. Le pieu qui se trouvait avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 ainsi mis sur la voie a \u00e9t\u00e9 entrain\u00e9 par la voiture et lui \u00e9crasa le pied. De l\u00e0 p\u00e9tition de droit r\u00e9clamant des dommages r\u00e9sultant de cet accident.\nIl n'y a pas de doute que si la voie avait \u00e9t\u00e9 tenue conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la loi, si on avait maintenu cette derni\u00e8re de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ce qu'elle ne f\u00fbt pas plus basse que d'un pouce du niveau du chemin public, l'accident ne serait pas arriv\u00e9.\nOn all\u00e8gue \u00e0 l'appui de la d\u00e9fense que des r\u00e8glements on \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9s par le gouverneur en conseil pour autoriser l'enl\u00e8vement de ces madriers durant l'hiver.\nIl est possible que ce r\u00e8glement soit l\u00e9gal. Mais, d'un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, le gouvernement est toujours tenu d'observer la loi et de voir \u00e0 ce que la voie ne soit jamais plus basse que le niveau du chemin public. Si les r\u00e8glements que l'on invoque ne peuvent pas \u00eatre observ\u00e9s sans violer cette disposition de la loi, alors je consid\u00e8re qu'ils sont ill\u00e9gaux; car l'autorit\u00e9 ex\u00e9cutive n'a jamais le droit, en faisant des r\u00e8glements, de d\u00e9roger aux dispositions formelles du statut.\nMais il y a plus. Le r\u00e8glement lui-m\u00eame que l'on invoque n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 observ\u00e9 car il exigeait de laisser au milieu de la voie un certain nombre de madriers et malheureusement cela n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fait.\nJe dois ajouter, de plus, que depuis l'accident en question on n'enl\u00e8ve plus ces madriers mais on laisse la voie telle qu'elle \u00e9tait. La cause premi\u00e8re de l'accident est donc la violation du statut et du r\u00e8glement. Il est bien vrai que le pieu qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sur la voie par une main inconnue a contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 l'accident. Mais les autorit\u00e9s du chemin de fer savaient que les gens \u00e9taient oblig\u00e9s d'avoir recours \u00e0 ces moyens pour pouvoir traverser la voie; et, de fait, l'un des employ\u00e9s de l'Intercolonial nous apprend dans son t\u00e9moignage que tous les matins on avait l'habitude d'enlever ces pieux et que celui qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9 sur la voie lorsque l'appelant l'a travers\u00e9e y avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9videmment mis dans la journ\u00e9e.\nEncore une fois, si on avait observ\u00e9 les dispositions de la loi l'accident ne serait pas arriv\u00e9. Et d'ailleurs, je consid\u00e8re que l'intim\u00e9 est responsable malgr\u00e9 le fait que l'une des causes de l'accident f\u00fbt l'acte d'un tiers qui aurait jet\u00e9 sur la voie ce pieu. Il n'est pas permis \u00e0 une personne qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 la cause effective du dommage de dire qu'il y a eu \u00e9galement d'autres causes : Clark v. Chambers[8].\nJe suis donc d'opinion que le jugement a quo qui a renvoy\u00e9 la p\u00e9tition de l'appelant, est mal fond\u00e9 et doit \u00eatre renvers\u00e9.\nQuant au montant des dommages les parties devront t\u00e2cher de s'entendre et si elles ne peuvent en venir \u00e0 cela alors le dossier devra \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 en Cour d'Echiquier qui en d\u00e9terminera le montant.\nL'appel est donc maintenu avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: S.

In 1913, P. entered into an agreement with C. to exchange the LeBreton Street property for lots on Lisgar Street, which was carried out by conveyances between C. and D. In his deed C. stated that the consideration was \u201can exchange of lands and $1.00,\u201d and conveyed the lots on Lisgar Street, subject to certain mortgages, the description being followed by the words, \u201cthe assumption of which mortgages is part of the consideration herein.\u201d C. was obliged to pay these mortgages, and brought suit against D. to recover the amount so paid.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Appellate Division (34 Ont. L.R. 580), that the case was not within the rule of equity whereby the purchaser of an equity of redemption may be obliged to indemnify his vendor against liability for the mortgage. Small v. Thompson (28 Can. S.C.R. 219) distinguished.\nHeld, also, that parol evidence was properly received to shew the relations between P. and D.; that D. received the conveyance from C. merely as P.\u2019s nominee, and held it afterwards only as security for his advances to P.; that he never claimed to be owner and never went into possession except as P.\u2019s agent; and that he was not a purchaser of the property, but only a mortgagee.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff. The facts are sufficiently stated in the above head-note.\nJ.R. Osborne for the appellant. Douglas was a purchaser of Power\u2019s land, not a mortgagee. Perry v. Meddowcroft[2].\nWhichever he was, he assumed the mortgages as part of the consideration, and, therefore, is liable in this action. Small v. Thompson[3], Waring v. Ward[4], and Adair v. Carden[5] are not applicable, in view of such assumption.\nThe assumption of the mortgages amounted to an express covenant to pay them. Even if it did not, as appellant would not have conveyed without this clause for assumption such a covenant should be read into the contract. Pioneer Bank v. Canadian Bank of Commerce[6].\nHogg K.C. for the respondents referred to Corby v. Gray[7], Mills v. United Counties Bank[8], and Walker v. Dickson[9].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed.\nIn stating the nature of the claim, I cannot do better than quote the words of the Master of the Rolls in the comparatively recent case of Mills v. United Counties Bank, Ltd.[10]:\u2014\nThe claim is based on this ground. It is said that, according to the settled law of the court, a purchaser of an equity of redemption is bound under an implied obligation, or, as it is sometimes put, an obligation of conscience, to indemnify the vendor against the liability on the mortgage debt; and, in an ordinary case, that is, I think, obviously according to justice and common sense. If a property is worth \u00a310,000 and is subject to a mortgage of \u00a35,000, and the purchaser only pays the vendor \u00a35,000 and gets the property, it would be almost shocking to say that in that case the vendor would be liable on the covenant to pay the full sum of \u00a35,000 to the first mortgagee, and that the purchaser was under no obligation to indemnify him.\nNow, I doubt whether the proposition is of so general and unqualified a character as contended for. It is to be noticed that, in the example given by the Master of the Rolls, he is speaking of a case where the property in the hands of the purchaser is sufficient to answer the mortgage debt. The same assumption is made in other cases where the doctrine has been discussed. But, if we remember that, as the courts hold, the obligation is one of conscience alone, can it be said that the obligation holds equally good where the pledge has proved worthless or indeed to be worth no more than the purchaser paid?\nAgain, Lord Justice Fletcher Moulton, in the case above referred to, speaking of the doctrine of Waring v. Ward[11], that there is an implied covenant, says:\u2014\nIt relates, I think, to every case where you can reasonably imply that it was the intention of the parties that that should be done, but I doubt whether it applies to any other case.\nNow, can we reasonably imply that it was the intention of the respondent, who was not in reality the purchaser, to indemnify the appellant against the mortgages?\nThis perhaps brings us to the point of the case on which the judgment appealed from proceeds, viz., that this is not a simple case as between the appellant and respondent of the relation of vendor and purchaser. I agree with the court that the circumstances and nature of the transaction are such as to rebut the implication of an unqualified personal liability on the part of the respondent. The courts are not, in my opinion, called upon in such cases to inquire too particularly into transactions often of a complicated nature and to consider whether they establish a case in which the expressed agreements between the parties ought to be supplemented by implied ones.\nIt is, of course, always open to a vendor to secure himself properly on a sale of the property, and, though there may be cases in which it is so clearly a matter of conscience for the purchaser to indemnify him that the court will imply a covenant where none was expressed, yet I do not think such implication of liability is to be lightly made.\nThe transactions out of which the claim arises seem to have been of the usual character of speculation in inflated values during a land boom. In these there are purchases, mortgages, exchanges, resales, shuffling of every description, until the speculation collapses, when disputes arise over the damages, which the courts are called on to unravel. Whilst the parties are entitled to the protection of any legal rights they may have, these are not cases in which the law need be strained for their relief.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Hodgins J.A., speaking for the majority of that court, in which reasons I concur.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The appellant conveyed certain lands to the late C.A. Douglas, and claims that he is entitled to recover from his grantee\u2019s representatives, now respondents, the amount of certain mortgages which existed upon the property conveyed at the time when the grant was made, because the conveyances described the property as subject to these mortgages, and then added,\nthe assumption of which mortgages is part of the consideration herein.\nThe grantee never executed the conveyance, and, therefore, his representatives cannot be held liable at common law.\nThe definition of a covenant in Comyn\u2019s Digest, A. 2, vol. 3, p. 263, deals with what may amount to a covenant on the assumption that the covenantor had executed the deed.\nThis is not the deed of an alleged covenantor. Any relief, therefore, that the appellant, whose deed it is, can have must rest upon equity.\nTo understand what that equity may be, we find the following in the deed in question:\u2014\nWitnesseth that, in consideration of an exchange of lands and the sum of one dollar of lawful money of Canada, now paid by the said party of the second part to the said party of the first part (the receipt whereof is hereby by him acknowledged), he the said party of the first part doth grant unto the said party of the second part in fee simple all and singular, * * *\nand then follows the description of the lands and mortgages ending as already stated.\nWhen we try to get the meaning out of this, in order to do equity, we find there never was any exchange of lands between the grantor and grantee, and we are told that the transaction referred to was one between one Power and the grantor in this deed.\nHow can that found any equity entitling appellant to the relief claimed as against this grantee or his representatives?\nAnd when the relation of the parties is further investigated, the matter becomes, if possible, more hopeless, for it turns out that all the grantee had to do with the matter was that Power, who seems to have been a speculator who had resorted to this grantee for advances on more than one occasion, and had, in the result, transferred to him, obviously as security, a number of properties on such terms as, if possible, to give their transaction the form of a sale or a conditional sale.\nIt is one of these properties which the grantee was asked to release and substitute therefor the lands now in question.\nTo accommodate appellant and Power he assented. Hence this conveyance to him.\nAt the time when this conveyance was made the time limited for Power to redeem had not expired.\nI need not follow the remarkable complications that existed beyond all this, for I am unable to find any equity upon which appellant can rest and establish a claim to recover from a man who never was either a purchaser from him or covenantor bound to him.\nWhether appellant might have found other equities of which something could have been made by bringing all the parties, including deceased, before the court, we need not trouble ourselves to consider, for no such claim is made.\nOn the case made, the appeal seems to me hopeless.\nThe contention that we must presume Power would make, and made default, does not seem to render the appellant\u2019s case any better.\nThe many cases where courts of equity have enforced obligations resting upon a purchaser as against those claiming under him, where obviously the prospective or subordinate purchaser (which shall we call this man?) has claimed, to enjoy the property, and been held bound in such case to implement the obligations of the purchaser, do not seem to me to furnish as a precedent anything like this case. Here the property evidently was not worth holding on to or asserting any claim to.\nThe whole of the dealings between Power and the deceased Douglas seem to have been in equities, and no obligation is shewn binding Douglas to Power to assume and pay the mortgages.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014Notwithstanding Mr. Osborne\u2019s forceful argument in support of the contrary view taken by Magee J.A., who dissented in the Appellate Division, I agree with the learned judges who formed the majority of that court that, read in the light of the circumstances as disclosed by the evidence, in my opinion properly received, the recital in the description of the property in the deed from Campbell to Douglas, that the assumption of mortgages upon the property conveyed was part of the consideration for the transfer, does not amount to a covenant by the grantee to indemnify the grantor against such mortgages. That consideration is stated elsewhere in the deed to be \u201can exchange of lands and the sum of $1.00.\u201d The portion of it of which the assumption of the mortgages formed part, i.e., the exchange of lands, was made between Campbell and Power. Douglas was not a party to it. He took the conveyance of the property given in exchange by Campbell merely as Power\u2019s nominee, and not as purchaser, or beneficial owner, but as security and as a mortgagee. As is pointed out by Hodgins J.A., Small v. Thompson[12], cited by the learned trial judge, was a clear case of express covenant.\nHaving \u201cregard to all the circumstances of the case and to all the relations subsisting between the parties,\u201d as we must, it is, I think, clear that they had no intention that Douglas should assume liability to indemnify Campbell. No reasonable implication of such an intention can arise. In its absence, the essential basis of the equitable obligation alternatively relied on by the appellant is lacking. Mills v. United Counties Bank[13]. Resembling it very closely in its facts, the case at bar seems to me to be not distinguishable in principle from Walker v. Dickson[14], which, I may be permitted to say with respect, was, in my opinion, well decided.\nDuring the argument it occurred to me that the appellant might invoke the doctrine of estoppel. But, on further consideration, I am satisfied that two essential elements of an estoppel are not present. The respondent neither uttered any word nor did any act inconsistent with his true position in regard to the property, or which would justify the appellant in assuming that he took the conveyance instead of Power, with whom Campbell had made the agreement for exchange, otherwise than as Power\u2019s nominee and for security. The appellant did not change his position to his prejudice in consequence of the deed being made to Douglas. He still retains any rights against Power which the agreement for exchange gave him.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Osborne & Broadfoot.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Hogg & Hogg.\n[1] 34 Ont.

Stones or earth falling from above struck him and he fell off the ledge to the bottom of the excavation sustaining severe injuries. In an action against the company for damages under the common law it was contended that failure to protect the workmen by a barrier above the ledge was negligence for which defendants were responsible.\nHeld, per Davies and Anglin JJ., that such negligence was that of the company's superintendent, a fellow servant of B., and the company was not responsible.\nPer Duff and Anglin JJ., following Wilson v. Merry (L.R. 1 H.L. Sc. 326), that, as it was proved that the company had appointed a competent engineer to take charge of the work, invested him with the requisite authority and responsibility for protecting the workmen and supplied him with the materials necessary for the purpose, they had discharged their duty towards their employees and were not responsible for the injury to B.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal (22 B.C. Rep. 241) reversed, Idington and Brodeur JJ. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe material facts are stated in the headnote. Sir Charles-Hibbert Tupper K.C. for the appellants. The preparation of the hill from time to time was not a \"system\" defects in which would entail liability: Allen v. New Gas Co.[2].\nThe appellants are within the doctrine in Wilson v. Merry[3]. See also Canada Woollen Mills v. Traplin[4], per Nesbit J.; Hedley v. Pinkney & Sons S.S. Co.[5], at page 226; Wood v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[6]; Canadian Asbestos Co. v. Girard[7].\nThe employer is not bound to take unusual or extraordinary precautions: Weems v. Mathieson[8].\nS. S. Taylor K.C. for the respondent. The jury's verdict should not be disturbed on appeal: Canadian Woollen Mills Co. v. Traplin[9]; Creveling v. Canadian Bridge Co.[10].\nThe company must provide a safe system and a safe place to work: Grant v. Acadia Coal Co.[11]; Ainslie Mining and Railway Co. v. McDougall[12]; Brooks, Scanlon O'Brien Co v. Fakkema[13].\nDAVIES J.\u2014This is an action brought to recover damages for injuries sustained by the plaintiff while he was engaged with two other workmen on a narrow ledge (3 or 4 feet broad) of an almost precipitous cliff or rock bluff some 85 feet in vertical height, 35 to 45 feet above him and 40 feet or more below him. The work these men were doing was the preparing of a level place on which to stand a power drill in order to blast off a column or jutting of rock on the face of the rock cliff against which it was proposed to build the side of the defendants' power house. The defendants were as a fact at the time of the accident preparing a site for an extensive power plant. The top of this edge on which plaintiff was working was some 35 or 40 feet above the floor or bottom of the rock excavation which had been made at the base of the cliff for the power house and the companies' operations had been carried on for a period extending over six or seven months, employing 300 to 400 men.\nNo drilling had been made immediately above the ledge on which plaintiff was working but blasting was necessary to blow out the column of rock which if left would interfere with the building up of the power house wall.\nThe operation was one incidental to the main work the parties were engaged in of preparing a site for and erecting a power house As a matter of fact it took about 9 or 10 hours only to complete and was a mere incident or detail in the general operations or work of construction of the company. That the work in which plaintiff was engaged at the time he fell off this ledge or rock was dangerous work is unquestionable.\nThat the entire work or operations of the company had been entrusted to a skilled, competent general manager and engineer, Mr. Haywood, was proved beyond any possible doubt, as also that he had been furnished with ample powers and with all appliances, material and workmen necessary to carry out the work successfully or the credit, if required, to procure them.\nThe case had already been tried once and was retried by order of this court.\nA number of pertinent questions had been prepared by counsel for submission to the jury; but the latter were told by the trial judge that it was not imperative for them to answer these questions and that they could find a general verdict.\nThey did, unfortunately, ignore the questions and found a general verdict \"for the plaintiff with $10,000 damages at common law.\"\nWe must assume that all questions of fact necessary to sustain that verdict were found in plaintiff's favour and amongst these that the defendants were guilty of negligence which proximately caused the accident and that the plaintiff was not guilty of contributory negligence. What the defendants' negligence consisted in the jury did not find, but I assume we must hold that it was in not having placed a barrage of logs along the top of the cliff, as contended by plaintiff should have been done. No other negligence is suggested or given in evidence. As a matter of fact, the general manager and engineer gave it as his opinion that such a barrage would increase rather than lessen the plaintiff's danger. In this he was supported by Colonel McDonell and other witnesses, but I do not think it is possible to say that the jury would not on the whole evidence be warranted in finding that the barrage was a reasonable and necessary precaution for the safety of the plaintiff and his co-workers.\nThe Court of Appeal for British Columbia sustained the judgment which the trial judge entered on the verdict for the plaintiff and from that judgment this appeal is taken.\nThe facts were that this vertical rock 100 feet high on a ledge of which about half way down plaintiff went with two others to do the blasting was capped by a sloping hillside which plaintiff had been ordered before going on with the blasting below to clear from rocks and loose stone and material and make what was known as a \"berm\" just above the top of the cliff for his own protection and that of his fellowworkmen when they descended to do the blasting on the ledge below.\nHis own evidence was to the effect that they had done this work all right and made the necessary \"berm\" but that nevertheless when he went on the ledge below and was about or in the act of drilling the necessary holes in the ledge for blasting something fell from the cliff above either stone, sand or clay, he did not know which, and knocked him off the ledge. The general verdict for the plaintiff rebuts the proof of contributory negligence and therefore it must be assumed that plaintiff and his co-workers had done their duty and efficiently carried out their orders to clear the hillside from all stones and had made a proper \"berm\" at the edge of the cliff.\nThe question immediately arose whether reasonable precautions had under the facts as proved been taken to prevent the falling of this stone, sand or clay, and, if they had not, whether their absence was due to the negligence or error of judgment of the superintendent manager for which the company was liable.\nThe rival contentions were, first, on the part of the plaintiff, that the work being an admittedly dangerous one more than ordinary precautions should have been taken and that, in addition to the \"berm\" being made at the top of the cliff, there should have been a barrier of logs or plank on or slightly above the brink of the rock cliff to prevent rolling stone and other debris from injuring employees working below; that the absence of such a precaution made the place below an \"unsafe\" one for men to work in and brought the company within the rule which made them liable in case of injury to their workmen, whether such was caused by the neglect on their superintendent engineer's part to provide the safety barrage or not.\nOn the other hand, appellant contends that the plaintiff must fail in maintaining his claim for three reasons; first, contributory negligence; secondly, voluntary assumption of the risk; and thirdly, that negligence, if there was any with respect to the barrage of logs, or error of judgment in not providing such barrage, was that of their superintendent, a fellowservant of the plaintiff, for which the company was not responsible.\nIt may be that, looking at the jury's finding in connection with the charge of the trial judge, the first two contentions of appellant should not be sustained.\nI am of opinion that his last contention must be given effect to and the appeal allowed.\nThe general proposition is not challenged that it is the duty of the employer and one which he cannot delegate to another so as to relieve himself of liability to provide his workmen, at any rate in the first instance, with a reasonably safe place to work in and reasonably suitable and necessary materials and appliances to work with. The question immediately arises whether the facts of this case bring it within the rule.\nThe work the company was engaged in was the construction and installation of a large power house. Some 300 men or more had been engaged for many months preparing the tail race and the foundations for this house. It was intended to build one side of the power house up against the vertical cliff spoken of. The special work plaintiff was engaged in when injured was a mere detail of that general work. As a fact, the blasting off of this ledge of rock to enable the wall to be erected only took a few hours, 9 to 10. It was work of a kind which obviously had to be carried on under the judgment and control of a skilled manager. The directors of such a company are not as a rule men competent for such a task. It must be delegated. It was work undertaken for the very purpose of carrying out the duty which the law casts upon them of providing a safe place for their men to work in.\nIf their duty is enlarged further and to the extent contended for and if it extends to the work antecedently necessary to create a \"safe place\" and done for that very purpose, however necessarily changing from day to day and however incidental to the main work of preparing a \"safe place,\" then it seems to me the doctrine of common employment, as laid down by the House of Lords in Wilson v. Merry[14], and applied by the courts ever since, would be greatly restricted. I can find no authority for so enlarging the rule as to the absolute liability of the master to provide a safe place for his workmen to work in. The place this plaintiff was working in was admittedly a dangerous one and known to the workmen to be so. The duty of the master was to provide a competent and skilled manager to superintend it who, in his turn, having been supplied with everything necessary, would determine what reasonable precautions were necessary to be taken. I cannot accede to the argument that for an error of judgment on his part in that regard the master would be liable. The work was a mere detail in the preparations for constructing a safe power house.\nMr. Taylor sought to meet the point that the work in question was a mere detail or incident of the work being carried on by contending that it was the company's duty to have had that barrage of logs during all the months the workmen were engaged in preparing the foundations of the power house at the cliff's base. But the necessity for such a protection is disproved by the fact that not a single man was injured of the hundreds employed during these months, when 300 to 400 men were employed, by anything which fell from the cliff above. We are, however, dealing now with the facts of this case, the blasting off of a column or shoulder of stone from the cliff's side, a single detail of a vast work; and after considering all the authorities cited I am of the opinion that the facts do not bring the plaintiff's case within the rule, excluding the doctrine of common employment.\nI do not think the decisions of this court at variance with that I have reached in this appeal. They affirm the main proposition of the absolute duty which cannot be delegated by the master, of providing a safe place for his workmen to work in. They do not go the length of saying that if a master in the attempted discharge of his duty so to provide a safe place for his workmen employs a skilled and competent man as his superintendent, furnishes him with everything necessary to do his work effectively and provides the \"safe place\" the law contemplates and does not personally actively interfere with the work, the master is liable to his workmen for damages caused to them from the negligence or error in judgment of such competent manager in carrying out every detail of that work.\nIn the case in this court chiefly relied upon of Ainslie Mining and Railway Co. v. McDougall[15], a majority of this court held that under the facts there proved it was not open to the employer to invoke the doctrine of common employment. The facts at the time of the accident complained of were as regards the mineowners' duties to their employees, that the mine owners were there for the first time placing their men at work in a mine which was held not to be at the time a safe place for the workmen to work in.\nIn the later case of Brooks, Scanlon, O'Brien Co. v. Fakkema[16], the court seems to have held that the damages awarded the injured workman were the result either of a defect in the original installation of the engine which caused the damage or in a defective system.\nI do not think the principle upon which either of these cases was decided applicable in the present case, where the doctrine of the absolute responsibility of the master is invoked. The work of constructing such a power house was necessarily changing from day to day, the particular work on which plaintiff was engaged was a mere incident or detail in the general work, the control and carrying out of which had been necessarily delegated to a competent engineer and the general work was one undertaken to discharge the master's absolute duty of providing a safe place for the workmen to be employed in his power-house.\nI at one time thought the late case decided by the Judicial Committee, Toronto Power Co. v. Paskwan[17], might be applicable, where it was held, as the headnote of the report states:\u2014\nThe duty towards an employee to provide proper plant, as distinguished from its subsequent care, falls upon the employer himself and cannot be delegated to his servants. He is not bound to adopt all the latest improvements and appliances; it is a question of fact, in each particular case, whether there has been a want of reasonable care in failing to install the appliance the absence of which is alleged to constitute negligence.\nIn that case, the jury found inter alia that the accident was due to the company's negligence through their master mechanic in failing to install proper safety appliances and to employ a competent signalman which the Judicial Committee said was not an unreasonable finding under the evidence and they dismissed an appeal from a judgment holding the master liable.\nIn the case before us, I hold, however, that the master's duty was not, under the circumstances, an absolute one and that it was open to him to invoke the doctrine of common employment. His attention had\nnot been called by any previous occurrence to the danger\nwhich the absence of the suggested barrage of logs might cause and nothing had occurred to induce him to actively interfere with the management and control he had wisely and necessarily delegated to his competent engineer foreman.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal and dismiss the action\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting) \u2014This case has been tried twice as a result of our disposition of the appeal as reported[18]. The pleadings were amended before the second trial and the evidence adduced thereon has tended to clear up some matters relative to the relation of the directorate of appellant to the work in question and their knowledge of how that was being carried on.\nI need not re-state my view of the law which should govern such cases.\nThe evidence applicable thereto adduced on the last trial furnishes ample ground for the jury to find the verdict they have and to maintain the judgment entered for respondent.\nThe work was carried on under the eyes and direction of a local branch of the directorate and thus the case brought well within the decision of this court in the case of Ainslie Mining and Railway Co. v. McDougall[19], and numerous other cases upon the liability of companies who so install their works as to render them unsafe for their workmen employed therein.\nThe latest case cited of Toronto Power Co. v. Paskwan[20], seems to leave no question upon that part of the matters involved in that branch of the case.\nMoreover, the evidence on the second trial brings out more clearly than its presentation on the first trial that it was the original installation of the work that was at fault.\nThe nature of the work that was being done by the workmen had changed from month to month as the work progressed but the same source of danger existed throughout and needed the same sort of protection, which respondent has urged throughout, in order to render the place a reasonably safe one to work in.\nOn the main ground of the appellant's contention it, therefore, fails.\nSome minor matters were urged as to misdirection which appellant claimed entitled it to a new trial. I have considered these but can find nothing which would justify ordering a new trial.\nIndeed, the appellant seems to me to have very little ground, if any, to complain of the charge of the learned trial judge.\nAnything its counsel objected to on the trial with any semblance of reason was corrected. And the alleged misdirection relative to evidence rejected, or improperly admitted, even if tenable at all which I doubt, cannot be said to have produced any miscarriage.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs. DUFF J.\u2014This is the second appeal to this court arising out of the same action each having been brought after a trial before a jury in which the verdict and judgment were given in favour of the plaintiff (respondent) See Bergklint v. Western Canada Power Co.[21]. The respondent was injured when working as a drillhelper on the side of an excavation which the appellant company was making to provide a site for its power house at Stave Falls in B.C. While engaged in clearing the narrow ledge on which he was standing in order to place the drill he was helping to work he was struck by something coming from the edge of the cliff, some 35 feet above, and losing his ba'ance in consequence fell to the bottom of the ravine, a distance of some 50 feet, and was very severely injured. The respondent's complaint upon which the action was based was that the appellant company negligently failed to provide sufficient protection against injury by rock or soil falling from the top of the cliff. The respondent was unable to say precisely what it was that struck him, but it must be taken for the purposes of the appeal that he was struck by rock or gravel or earth with sufficient momentum to throw him off his balance. The excavation was a large one, 400 feet in length by 100 in width, and the work was in progress many months. The respondent's case was that the appellant company should have provided a barrier at the edge of the cliff to protect the workmen from the danger of falling material. The course actually adopted by the engineer in charge of the work, who was entrusted with full responsibility with respect to such precautions, was from time to time at places where men were about to work on the cliff side to have a gang of men clear away from the top of the cliff such materials as appeared to be possible sources of danger. It has been found by the jury, and I shall of course assume it as the basis of this judgment, that the engineer in pursuing this course, in failing, that is to say, to provide something in the nature of a physical barrier at the place where Bergklint was injured, was negligent and that, if the appellant company is answerable for his negligence, the respondent is entitled to succeed and the appeal should be dismissed. The appellant company's defence, in so far as it is material in the view I take of the case, was that Mr. Hayward, the engineer in charge of the works, was entrusted by the company with authority and with the responsibility of taking whatever precautions for the protection of the workmen might be required by a proper regard for their safety and that he was supplied with sufficient means to enable him to provide any protection that in his judgment might be expedient and that Mr. Hayward's competence not being really questioned the appellant company had thereby discharged its duty to its employees. In answer to that (it may be mentioned) it was contended that there was sufficient evidence to shew such actual intervention by Mr. McNeil, the vice-president of the company, as to justify the jury in finding that the company was directly responsible through Mr. McNeil. I may say at once, and I dismiss the point with this observation, that I think there is no such evidence.\nThe question is: Could the company discharge its duty to its workmen, in respect of such precautions, by the employment of Mr. Hayward, a competent engineer, and by giving him the authority and the resources which were given to him? On the present appeal the fact that the necessary authority and resources were given to Mr. Hayward cannot be disputed. The question upon which it is now our duty to pass is in substance the question decided by the majority of the court adversely to the respondent on the previous appeal. On that occasion the view expressed was that the circumstances of the respondent's employment and of the work in which the appellant company was engaged were such as to take this case out of that class of cases in which the rule is that the owner is responsible not only for taking due care to see that the employee has a safe place to work in but is bound to see that due care is taken by those to whom he commits the performance of the duty; in other words, is responsible for failure on their part to exercise due care to that end. The opnion was expressed, that having regard to the conditions\u2014the character of the work and the physical surroundings\u2014the duty of providing protection for the workingmen from time to time as the work progressed was a duty in the nature of a duty of superintendence requiring the judgment of the man on the spot for its efficient performance and was therefore not one of the duties in respect of which it is said that the master cannot divest himself of the responsibility by delegating it to an employee. The case seemed to fall within the actual decision in Wilson v. Merry[22], where the owner was held by the appointment of a competent superintendent with adequate means and resources to have discharged or divested himself of his responsibility regarding so grave a matter as providing \"local ventilation\" in a shaft where workmen were engaged in opening a drift into an unworked seam of coal\u2014an explosion of fire damp having been the consequence of neglect. That, as was pointed out on the previous occasion, was regarded by several of their Lordships as being in the nature of a duty of superintendence and therefore naturally devolving upon the superintendent of the mine.\nIt may indeed be a question, in view of the judgment delivered in the last appeal on this point, whether the respondent is not estopped from raising the question now. The evidence now before us in so far as it differs from the evidence on the previous trial, as stated in the judgments previously delivered, is not in its bearing on this point more favourable than that evidence was to the respondent. On the last trial the respondent strongly pressed the contention that the escape from the top of the cliff of the material that struck him was probably due to the existence of exceptional conditions at the place where it occurred\u2014 that the material had been loosened by the action of water, there being as he alleged a trickling of water near by. It is true that the judgment directed a new trial only but this order was made on the ground that the trial judge had not left to the jury the question whether or not the duty of taking precautions and resources sufficient to enable him to take them effectively had been entrusted to Hayward. There is some authority indicating that where a court of appeal in granting a new trial decides a substantive question in the litigation, that question, for the purposes of that litigation, is to be taken to have been conclusively determined as between the parties. I refer without further discussion to the observations of Lord Macnaghten in Badar Bee v. Habib Merican Noordin[23], at p. 623, and to their Lordships' decision in Ram Kirpal Shukul v. Mussumat Rup Kuari[24], (see especially p. 41 as to the effect of determinations in interlocutory judgments upon the rights of parties in the suits in which the judgments are given). It seems quite clear that for this purpose we are not confined to the formal judgment; Kali Krishna Tagore v. Secretary of State for India[25], and Petherpermal Chetty v. Mumandi Servai[26], at p. 108.\nIt is true, however, that the record of the previous trial and appeal are not formally before us and moreover that the point was not taken and has not been argued by counsel. As I think the appeal should be allowed on other grounds, I say nothing more about it.\nWhat I have said touching the ground of judgment given by the majority of the court on the previous appeal would be conclusive and I should leave the matter there were it not for an argument based upon the decision of the Privy Council in Toronto Power Co. v. Paskwan[27], pronounced since the judgment in the last appeal was given. The judgment of their Lordships was delivered by Sir Arthur Channell and in the course of that judgment, at pp. 737 and 738, he says:\u2014\nThe contention of the defendants is that they performed their duty by leaving the selection and care of the plant to a competent man, and they rely mainly on a well-known passage in the judgment of Lord Cairns in Wilson v. Merry[28]. Reliance was also placed on Cribb v. Kynoch[29], and Young v. Hoffman Mfg. Co.[30]. It is, of course, true that a master is not bound to give personal superintendence to the conduct of the works, and that there are many things which in general it is for the safety of the workman that the master should not personally undertake. It is, necessary, however, in each to consider the duty omitted, and the providing proper plant as distinguished from its subsequent care, is especially within the province of the master rather than of his servants.\nIn Cribb v. Kynoch[31] and Young v. Hoffman Mfg. Co.[32] the question arose as to the duty of a master to have inexperienced persons in his employ properly instructed in the way to perform dangerous work, and that is a matter which it is fairly obvious must in almost all cases be done for the master by others. The supplying of that which in the opinion of a jury is proper plant stands on rather a different footing. I cannot infer from His Lordship's observations that their Lordships in any way questioned the actual decision in Wilson v. Merry[33], and I think there is nothing in their Lordships' judgment or in the decision affecting the considerations upon which the opinion expressed on the previous appeal was based.\nOne point not previously mentioned calls for a word. The appellant company incorporated by letters patent and governed by the Dominion Companies Act passed certain by-laws which authorized the appointment of executive committees selected from the members of the board of directors and the investing of such committees with such powers as the directors should deem advisable. An executive committee was appointed for Vancouver which consisted of three members of the board of directors and the by-law appointing them at the same time provided that Mr. Hayward, who was not a director, should be authorized to attend the meetings and to take part in all its deliberations and be \"ex officio a member of the committee.\" There was also a power of attorney executed by the company conferring large powers upon these four persons to be exercised by any two or three of them. It is argued that Mr. Hayward by reason of being a joint donee of the powers under the power of attorney stood in the same relation to the company for the purposes of this action as the board of directors themselves. The answer to that is that Mr. Hayward was general manager and engineer in charge and as such exercised only such powers as were vested in him by virtue of his appointment to those offices, or otherwise entrusted to him as general manager or engineer in charge; and it was as general manager and engineer in charge that he was entrusted with the duty to provide protection for the workmen.\nIt was not in the exercise of powers vested in him under the power of attorney jointly with the members of the executive committee proper that he is chargeable with negligence.\nThe company could not moreover be chargeable with notice through Hayward of the negligence found against him. There is not the slightest evidence of want of good faith on Hayward's part and if notice of the facts known to Hayward be imputed to the company notice also must be imputed of Hayward's opinion that the precautions taken by him were sufficient. In these circumstances and in view of Hayward's admitted qualifications, assuming the company is not responsible for Hayward's omissions it cannot be charged with wrongful neglect in failing to direct that some additional precaution should be provided.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The facts of this case and its surrounding circumstances are fully set out in the judgments delivered on the former appeal to this court; Bergklint v. Western Canada Power Co.[34]; and in assigning reasons for the conclusion which I have reached, that the present appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed, I find it necessary to add little to what I then said.\nThe only material variation in the evidence at the new trial is that the plaintiff has now emphasized water conditions on the hillside as a definite and all\u2014important element of danger\u2014a development which I should regard with grave suspicion.\nThe second trial (in the order for which I reluctantly concurred) has resulted in a general verdict for the plaintiff, his recovery being increased, however, from $5,500 to $10,000.\nThe sole ground of negligence on the part of the defendants now relied upon is the failure to have provided an overhead barrier or shield of logs for the protection of the plaintiff and the workmen engaged with him\u2014and that is the fault on which it is claimed for him that the jury based their verdict in his favour.\nAfter careful consideration of it, the evidence now before us seems to me to establish that the overhead protection of a shield or barrier of logs or planks is required only where sufficient clearing of the hillside is not feasible or is too expensive; that it was entirely practicable in the present case to have thoroughly cleared away all debris and loose stuff from above the place where the plaintiff was working when injured; that he and his associate workman had been instructed to so clear it and had assumed to discharge that duty; that there were no conditions present which would render clearing properly done inefficient or inadequate as a protection; and that it was only when assured that the work of clearing had been properly done that the foreman allowed the plaintiff to go upon the ledge in order to proceed with the preparation for drilling at which he was engaged when injured. Apart altogether from any question of contributory negligence or any issue of volens, if trying the action I think I should unhesitatingly hold that the facts in evidence would not support a finding that the omission to have a shield of logs placed above the workmen's heads amounted to actionable negligence, and that, if it was a mistake at all, it was the result of a mere error of judgment which should not entail liability.\nBut assuming that it was open to the jury on any theory suggested to have found that it was negligence, it was clearly that of the superintendent Hayward, who was undoubtedly a fellow-employee of the plaintiff.\nCounsel for the plaintiff urged that the shield of planks or logs was required as a protection throughout the entire period of the construction of the defendants' works for men working in the valley below and on the hillside, and that its absence should therefore be regarded as a defect in original installation or a failure to make proper provision in the first instance\u2014from liability for which no delegation of duty, however comprehensive, to officials, however competent and well equipped, could relieve the employer. Toronto Power Co. v. Paskwan[35], affords a recent and a very striking illustration of the absolute character of that duty. The evidence before us, however, does not support this contention. The guard or barrier of logs is not dealt with, even by the expert witnesses called by the plaintiff, as such a permanent or relatively permanent requirement.\nAn attempt to shew knowledge of conditions and control of, or interference in, the superintendence or management of the works by the directors of the company, or any of them, utterly failed. Everything in the nature of superintendence and management was unqualifiedly entrusted to Mr. Hayward. As the learned trial judge put it in his charge:\u2014\nIt does not appear that they (the directors) in any way interfered in the practical physical operation of the work. In other words, they were simply business men who left the practical duties to the superintendent and his staff.\nYet the jury may have based their verdict upon a finding\u2014made, of course, without any evidence to warrant it\u2014that the directors did attempt to manage or supervise the work themselves and were negligent in doing so, since, notwithstanding what he had stated as to the lack of evidence, the learned judge left it to the jury to say whether they had in fact so interfered. I find nothing in the record to alter the view taken by other members of the court as well as myself on the former appeal that the provision of suitable protection for employees engaged as the plaintiff was when injured\ncould properly be delegated to a competent superintendent or foreman (furnished with adequate means and resources) whose negligence would not render the employer liable at common law.\nWith my Lord the Chief Justice I thought that upon the case then before us it was clear beyond question that this duty had been so delegated and that the furnishing adequate means and resources to the superintendent was conceded.\nA new trial was ordered because in the opinion of my brother Duff[36], the trial judge had in effect refused to leave to the jury the question\nwhether the duty of superintendence was in fact in this case retained by the directors or others having authority to exercise the general powers, or whether, on the contrary, Mr. Hayward had such authority and resources at his command and was under a duty expressed or implied to use them in furnishing the suggested safeguards, if such safeguards were reasonably necessary.\nMr. Hayward's competency has never been in question. Whatever may have been the case upon the former record, his duty and authority in the premises and the adequacy of the resources at his command are put beyond controversy by the evidence now before us. Yet the jury may have found otherwise, since the learned trial judge, notwithstanding that he had told them that Hayward was a competent superintendent, that the duties of superintendence had been left to him and that he and Fraser, the foreman,\nhad at their command, according to the evidence, for the purpose of fulfilling their duties, the necessary facilities, appliances and funds,\nnevertheless afterwards explicitly left it to them to determine whether Mr. Hayward, the superintendent, had full authority to superintend the work and whether he had at his command all the necessary appliances and facilities for so carrying on the work,\nadding that, if they should so find, the plaintiff could not succeed (at common law) on that branch.\nWhether the verdict at common law was based on supposed failure of the directors to charge Hayward with the full duties of superintendence, or to supply him with the necessary means and resources, or upon some personal negligent interference by the directors or some of them, cannot now be known. But upon whatever view the jury may have proceeded the verdict is against the evidence and perverse.\nFor these reasons (some of them more fully stated in the report of the former appeal at pp. 57-70) I am with respect of the opinion that if there was any fault (I incline to think there was not) on Mr. Hayward's part, it did not entail liability of the company at common law.\nIn order that the plaintiff should recover under the \"Employers' Liability Act\" it would be necessary to treat the verdict as a finding that the failure to protect him and his fellow workmen by a shield of logs was negligence in superintendence on the part of Mr. Hayward. At the former trial this aspect of the case raised on the pleadings was practically abandoned. The trial judge then told the jury, without objection; that, if the plaintiff should recover at all, it must be at common law. At the second trial, although evidence was given in support of the claim under the Act and the jury was invited to deal with it, they ignored it and merely found\nfor the plaintiff for $10,000 under the common law.\nIn his factum on the present appeal and at bar in this court counsel for the respondent made not the slightest allusion to this branch of his client's claim. More- over, as I have already pointed out, in view of the manner in which the case went to the jury, it is impossible to say that their verdict, holding the defendants liable at common law, was not based upon a finding that the directors of the company had personally interfered in the management and supervision of the work and had been themselves negligent therein. There is no assurance that the verdict proceeded upon negligence on the part of Hayward, which would be necessary to sustain a judgment under the \"Employers' Liability Act\" If we were otherwise at liberty to deal with the case upon an aspect of it ignored by the jury and not presented in argument before us, this uncertainty about the meaning and effect of the verdict would appear to present an insuperable obstacle to our now holding the plaintiff entitled to recover under the \"Employers' Liability Act.\"\nThe appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed. If the defendants ask them, they are entitled to all the costs of the litigation of which we have power to dispose.\nBRODEUR J. (dissenting).\u2014This is an accident case which already came before us, Bergklint v. Western Canada Power Co.[37], and in which the majority of this court was of opinion that a new trial should take place. It was then stated that there was evidence upon which a jury might have found that the duty of providing proper safe-guards had been entrusted to a competent person provided with the necessary means of doing so and that the failure of the trial judge to leave this question to the jury necessitated a new trial.\nI was then of opinion that the findings of the jury were sufficiently supported by evidence and warranted judgment in favour of Bergklint. A new trial has taken place and some of the objections raised against the former verdict have disappeared.\nIt had been found in the first verdict that the defendants had been negligent in not sufficiently clearing the face of the incline and placing barriers to prevent rolling stones and other debris from causing injury to the employees.\nIt was decided by the Court of Appeal of British Columbia that this insufficient clearing having been carried out by Bergklint and his fellow-workmen that there was contributory negligence on his part and that the verdict in his favour should be set aside.\nOn the new trial this question of clearing was, of course, the subject of evidence and it is shewn very clearly, in my opinion, that the clearing was well done and, in the language of the general manager of the company,\nit was properly cleared of anything that would drop or break down.\nThat phase of the case was not very strongly pressed upon us; but the main question which was argued was that the verdict of the jury under the doctrine of Wilson v. Merry[38], could not be supported. In that case of Wilson v. Merry[39], it was stated by Lord Cairns that what the master is bound to his servant to do, in the event of his not personally superintending and directing the work, is to select proper and competent persons to do it and to furnish them with adequate materials and resources for the work.\nIt is contended by the respondent on this appeal that barriers should have been erected on the cliff in order to protect the servants of the company working below against rolling stones or debris which might come from that cliff. Blasting was being done constantly and it was necessary that some protection should be used in order that no debris should reach the men.\nThat question of giving protection to the men by means of barriers is controverted, it being claimed by the appellant company that those barriers would not give proper protection.\nAccording to my opinion, the company was not bound to use all the latest improvements and appliances. It is a question of fact in each particular case whether there has been negligence in failing to install any appliance: Toronto Power Co. v. Paskwan[40].\nThe jury in this case has brought in a general verdict of negligence against the company. They evidently found that those barriers whould have constituted, in the circumstances, a proper protection and that the neglect of the company to install these appliances constituted on its part a case of negligence.\nThere was certainly evidence on which the jury could find such a verdict and I have come to the conclusion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Tupper, Kitts & Wightman.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Taylor, Harvey, Grant,Stockton & Smith.\n[1] 22 B.C.

VII., c. 50\u2014Quebec \"Expropriation Act,\" 54 Vict. c. 38\u2014Words and phrases\u2014\" Avoisinant\"\u2014\"Adjoining.\"\nThe statutes incorporating the Town of Fraserville, (3 Edw. VII., ch. 69' 6 Edw. VII., ch. 50 (Que.)), by section 183 gave power to expropriate lands both within and outside the limits of the municipality and section 193 substituted a new section to replace article 4561 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec, 1888, in regard to expropriations. In expropriating lands outside its limits for an electric lighting system the town proceeded under articles 4562 to 4569 of the \"Towns Corporations Act,\" R.S.Q., 1888, incorporated as part of the charter by force of article 4178, R.S.Q., 1888, and obtained an order appointing an arbitrator on behalf of the owner from a judge of the Superior Court. Notwithstanding objection by the owner, an award was made and he brought action to set it aside on the ground that, by section 193, the application of articles 4562 to 4569 was confined, in the case of the Town of Fraserville, to expropriations within its limits and, as to expropriations beyond that area, nominations of arbitrators could be made only by the Attorney-General as provided by the \"Expropriation Act,\" 54 Vict. ch. 38.\nHeld, Anglin J. dissenting.\u2014That the sixth section of the Act, 6 Edw. VII., ch 50, by specifically authorizing the municipality to expropriate lands outside its limits enacted provisions incompatible with those of article 4561, R.S.Q., 1888, as so replaced by section 193, and it was, therefore, repealed, as the repugnant provisions of the later statute prevailed. The King v. The Justices of Middlesex (2 B. & Ad. 818), and In re Cannings and County Council of Middlesex ([1907], 1 K.B. 51), followed. Consequently, the procedure adopted for the appointment of arbitrators was proper and the award was valid.\nThe statute, 6 Edw. VII., ch. 50, by section 6, authorizing expropriations outside the town, in the French version made use of the phrase \"dans ou en dehors de la ville et les municipalit\u00e9s avoisanantes,\" while the English version used the term \"adjoining municipalities.\" The 297th section of the charter provided that in the event of discrepancy preference should be given to the French version.\nHeld, that the statute should be interpreted according to the meaning of the broader term \"avoisinantes,\" used in the French version and, consequently, in exercising such powers of expropriation, the municipality was not limited to taking lands in contiguous municipalities.\nPer Anglin J.\u2014By section 193 of the charter the application of the provisions of the \"Towns Corporations Act,\" arts. 4165 et seq. R.S.Q., 1888, is expressly confined to expropriations within the town; section 193 was not excluded from the charter nor impliedly repealed by the amendment of 1906 to section 183, and the appointment of arbitrators by the judge was an usurpation of the jurisdiction conferred by articles 5754d and 5754e, R.S.Q., 1888 (54 Vict. ch. 38, sec. 1), upon the Attorney-General of the province.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, affirming the judgment of Letellier J., in the Superior Court for the District of Kamouraska, which dismissed the plaintiff's action with costs.\nThe circumstances of the case are stated in the judgments now reported.\nSt. Germain K.C. and St Laurent K.C. for the appellant.\nStein K.C. for the respondent.\nDavies J.\u2014The single question upon which I have entertained any doubt in this case is whether the appointment of arbitrators to determine the damages to which the appellant was entitled for or by reason of the expropriation by the respondent of certain lands of his outside of the Town of Fraserville should have been made by the Attorney-General under the provisions of the general \"Expropriation Act\" or by a judge of the Superior Court under the articles of the \"Towns Corporations Act\"\u20144561 to 4569\u2014and the subdivision sec. 11 \"Expropriation for Municipal Purposes.\"\nThe argument for the appellant is that section 4561 of these general expropriation sections was \"replaced for the Town\" of Fraserville by article 193 of ch. 69, 3 Edw. VII., (1903), amending the charter of Fraserville, that by this amendment the town's power of expropriation was limited to lands, buildings and structures \"in the town\" and that, therefore, the general provisions of the \"Towns Act\" relating to the manner of expropriation did not apply to these lands which were outside of the town's jurisdiction and powers.\nThe respondent, on the other hand, contends that so far as the construction of its electric light works was concerned this limitation on the town's power of expropriation \"to lands, buildings and structures within the town\" was removed by article 6 of the amendment to its charter in 1906, and that the methods by which this power of expropriation so extended should be exercised are to be found in the articles 4561 to 4569 of the \"Towns Corporations Act\" under the general heading of \"Expropriation for Municipal Purposes.\"\nThe respondent invokes in support of its argument articles 4178 and 4179 of the \"Towns Corporations Act\" the first of which declares generally that the provisions of this chapter apply to every town etc. and\nunless expressly modified or excepted they constitute part of its charter,\nand the latter of which enacts for any of the provisions of this chapter not to be incorporated in the charter it must be expressly declared that such provisions specifying them by their numbers shall not form part thereof.\nArticle 4561 of the \"Towns Corporations Act,\" R.S.Q., 1888, title XL, conferring power of expropriation upon towns within the scope of the town's jurisdiction was amended, in 1903, by article 193 of ch. 69, 3 Edw. VII., limiting that power to land etc. \"in the town\" but this limitation, so far as the construction and maintenance of the electric works of the town were concerned, was done away with by the amendment of 1906 before referred to, and the land of the appellant, outside of the town, was under that amending power legally expropriated for the electric purposes of the town.\nThis extension of the limitation put upon the town's powers of expropriation then, it is said, necessarily left the provisions of the \"Towns Corporations Act\" as to the method of procedure applicable and so do not admit of the application of the general \"Expropriation Act.\" I admit the difficulties in reaching a conclusion and have given the point much consideration. After reading the carefully prepared opinion of Mr. Justice Brodeur, I have concluded that his construction of the different statutes is right, that the proceedings taken to appoint the arbitrators under the \"Towns Corporations Act\" were correct and that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014I agree in the main herein with the reasons assigned by the courts below. But I have had some difficulty in trying to reconcile the enactment of section 193 of 3 Edw. VII., ch. 69, of Quebec, with the provisions necessary to be observed in the case of expropriation outside the town. It is quite clear the peculiar wording of that section never was necessary, for the scope of the jurisdiction of the town, as it stood in the section thus supplanted, covered and was limited to that needed.\nI think the section 6 of 6 Edw. VII., ch. 50, three years later, amending section 193 of the first mentioned Act may be taken as an implied repeal of the limitation implied in the word \"town\" in said section 193, so much in evidence in the argument.\nI conclude the two cannot stand together and the later one should prevail. Then the general provisions of the \"Municipal Act\" relative to town corporations does the rest.\nI do not overlook the alternative properly and forcibly presented by Mr. St. Germain. His proposition relative, to the general enactment providing for the Attorney-General naming the umpire or a sole arbitrator in case of disagreement, does not cover the whole ground involved in the questions raised herein. I need not elaborate.\nIn short the legislation has to be given some sort of sensible meaning.\nAt this stage it should not be expected of us to reverse the finding as to amount (especially when two of the board were selected by a judge) of the award of arbitrators acting within their powers when unanimously maintained by the courts below.\nI admit the appellant has presented some plausible and, possibly, cogent reasons for his contention. But I fail to see anything more therein than what in the last analysis is matter of opinion of what the market value is of that taken.\nSpecial advantages have been and must be tested by their value; not by what the owner may imagine and try to dictate as a price. There does not seem any good reason to believe all these things were ignored by the majority of the arbitrators.\nThe only other matter of legal principle involved in the appellant's allegations, upon which we could properly act, is that relative to the expropriation being in part founded upon a resolution instead of by-law.\nHe has not so much to complain of in that regard as either plaintiff had in the cases of Larin v. Lapointe[1], reversed in the Privy Council under the name of Lapointe v. Larin[2], and Robertson v. City of Montreal[3]. In the former the non-observance of forms of procedure as prescribed by statute did not seem of importance in the court above when the unanimous council in fact had directed something to be done without pursuing the method laid down in the statute; and in the latter case the majority of this court held a similar departure from the prescribed path by way of a by-law when substituted by using a resolution was not ultra vires or at least so far so that a ratepayer or contracting party could complain.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014There is only one point requiring discussion. It arises in this way. The legislative charter of the Town of Fraserville, which is contained in an Act of the Legislature passed in the year 1903, was amended in 1906 in such a way as to provide that, for the purposes of establishing and maintaining a system of electric lighting, the municipality should have compulsory powers of expropriation as regards immovables both within and without the town. (Sec. 183, ch. 69, 3 Edw. VII., as amended by 6 Edw. VII., ch. 50, sec. 6.) The municipality in acquiring for these purposes property outside its territorial limits has proceeded on the assumption that the machinery for expropriating land outside as well as that inside the town is the machinery provided by articles 4562 to 4569 of the \"Towns Corporations Act,\" R.S.Q., 1888, which with certain immaterial modifications became incorporated in the charter of 1903 by force of article 4178, R.S.Q., 1888. The appellant denies, that these provisions of the \"Towns Corporations Act,\" although incorporated in the charter and applicable to expropriations within the town, have any operation when an expropriation of property beyond the limits of the town is in question. Admittedly if the appellant is right in this contention the proceedings now impeached before us are invalid because if these enactments of the \"Towns Corporations Act\" are not the enactments by which such proceedings are governed then the method of procedure which it was the duty of the municipality to follow in such expropriations was that prescribed by the \"Expropriation Act\" and admittedly the procedure so prescribed was departed from in essential respects.\nThe question for determination is: Was the municipality, in expropriations of property outside the town, entitled to avail itself of the provisions of the \"Towns Corporations Act\" above referred to?\nThe point of the difficulty can, I think, be most clearly put by first explaining the contention of the appellant. The articles 4562 to 4569 of the \"Towns Corporations Act\" relating to expropriation which the municipality says are applicable and the appellant denies to be applicable to such expropriations are preceded by article 4561 which is the first section in a fasciculus under the sub-title \"Expropriation for Municipal Purposes.\" This article is in the following words:\u2014 The council may, by complying with the provisions following, appropriate any land required for the execution of works ordered by it within the scope of its jurisdiction: 40 Vict. ch. 29, sec. 386.\nThe charter of 1903 did not adopt article 4561 as it stands. The first section of a group of sections of the charter bearing the sub-title \"Expropriations\" is section 193 which deals with that article as follows:\u2014\nL'article 4561 des Statuts Refondus est remplac\u00e9, pour la ville, par le suivant:\nLe conseil pourra s'approprier, dans la ville, le terrain et les batiments ou constructions nec\u00e9ssaires \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution des travaux ordonn\u00e9s par lui, dans les limites de ses attributions, en se conformant aux dispositions suivantes;\nand it will be observed that the article which by this enactment is, as regards the Town of Fraserville, substituted for article 4561 expressly confines the powers thereby given to cases of expropriation within the town.\nNow the appellant argues that the effect of this substituted article and especially of the words\nle conseil pourra s'approprier dans la ville * * * en se conformant aux dispositions suivantes\nis to limit the application of the \"dispositions suivantes,\" that is to say, of articles 4562 to 4569 of the \"Towns Corporations Act\" to such expropriations. The appellant assuming that point to be safely reached, has, of course, no difficulty in establishing the conclusion which indeed necessarily follows that the charter itself neither explicitly nor by reference to the \"Towns Corporations Act\" provides any machinery for the expropriation of the property outside the town and consequently that for such purposes the municipality must resort to the \"Expropriation Act.\"\nNot only is this argument a plausible one but it must, I think, be conceded that the view advanced by the appellant of the construction and effect of section 193 of the charter of 1903 is an admissible construction; indeed, at the conclusion of the argument I was strongly, inclined to think that it was the right construction and that effect ought to be given to it.\nThere is, of course, some degree of a priori probability against the inference that the legislature intended to prescribe in respect of compulsory powers exercisable for the same object and by the same municipality one machinery where the property to be taken is within the municipality and a different machinery where the property to be taken is outside the municipality; where it is admitted that one set of machinery is not better adapted than the other set to either class of expropriation\u2014as is the case here.\nI feel at liberty to adopt the respondent's construction if it appear from the point of view of verbal interpretation to be a reasonably admissible one, even though from that standpoint alone the appellant's construction should be in some degree the preferable.\nI find no difficulty in holding that the respondent's construction is a reasonably admissible construction. I have already pointed out that section 183, which confers compulsory powers simply, neither in the charter of 1903 nor in the amendment of 1906 has anything to say on the subject of machinery. So it must be observed when the article is narrowly examined, that article 4561 of the \"Towns Corporations Act\" is primarily concerned not with machinery but with the conferring of substantive powers. It is a comprehensive provision which declares that when the municipality orders works that it has jurisdiction to order the municipality shall have authority to take the necessary land. It is quite true that the article adds that this may be done by complying with the subsequent provisions, but this phrase adds nothing to the construction which would have been put upon the article and the subsequent provisions if it had been absent and it certainly is not necessary to read it as restricting the scope of the succeeding articles by limiting their application to cases of expropriation by the municipality under the general powers conferred by the article 4561 itself. What effect then is to be attributed to section 193 which declares that article 4561 is replaced by an article in which the general powers of expropriation thereby conferred are limited in their application to those cases in which the property required is situated within the town. The answer to this question is dictated by the fact that the substituted article, like article 4561 itself, is primarily a provision dealing with substantive powers of expropriation, a comprehensive provision applying to all cases not specifically provided for in which it is necessary to take land for municipal purposes within the town. The charter contains a number of sections conferring such powers for specific purposes. Must we conclude that the machinery provided by the succeeding articles is available only in cases of expropriation under the residuary powers thus conferred? I repeat, such is not the necessary result of the limiting words. There is nothing in the language of the substituted article and nothing in that of articles 4562 to 4569 which are part of the charter requiring us to hold that the machinery provided by these articles is not available for proceedings in exercise of powers given for specific purposes under other provisions of the charter such as that found in section 183.\nThese in outline are the reasons (they are, I think, in accordance with those of my brother Brodeur) from which I have concluded that we are entitled to hold that the judgment of the court below was not erroneous. Anglin J. (dissenting).\u2014In my opinion the appellant is entitled to succeed on the ground that the application of the expropriation provisions of the \"Towns Act\" (R.S.Q., 1888, arts. 4561 et seq.) is by section 193 of the charter of the Town of Fraserville, enacted in 1903, expressly confined to expropriations within the town. The French version of section 193 puts this restriction beyond any possibility of doubt.* The method to be pursued in the case of expropriations outside the limits of the town, which have, since 1903, been authorized by section 182 of the charter for waterworks purposes, and are now by an amendment to section 183, passed in 1906, also authorized for the purposes of the town electric lighting system, is not expressly provided for in the charter. If, notwithstanding the fact that article 4561 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec, 1888, has been \"replaced for the town\" by a section which restricts the application of the method of expropriation provided by the succeeding group of articles in the Revised Statutes to expropriations within the town, that group of articles applies also to expropriations outside the town, the restriction\n*R.S.Q., 1888, (French version.) Art. 4561.\u2014Le conseil pourra s'approprier le terrain n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution des travaux ordonn\u00e9s par lui dans les limites de ses attributions, en se conformant aux dispositions suivantes.\u2014 (English version.) Art. 4561.\u2014The council may, by complying with the provisions following, appropriate any land required for the execution of works ordered by it within the scope of its jurisdiction.\nCharter of Fraserville, (1903,) 3 Edw. VII., ch. 69. (French version.) Sec. 193.\u2014L'article 4561 des Statuts Refondus est remplac\u00e9, pour la ville, par le suivant:\u2014Le conseil pourra s'approprier, dans la ville, le terrain et les b\u00e2timents ou constructions n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution des travaux ordonn\u00e9s par lui, dans les limites.de ses attributions, en se conformant aux dispositions suivantes.\u2014 (English version.) Sec. 193.\u2014Article 4561 of the Revised Statutes is replaced, for the town, by the following:\u2014The council may, by complying with the following provisions, appropriate any land, buildings and structures in the town, required for the execution of works ordered by it, within the scope of its jurisdiction. thus imposed would be meaningless and ineffectual\u2014a result so abhorrent to sound construction that it can be accepted only if inevitable. Articles 4562 et seq. of the Revised Statutes of Quebec, 1888, were not excluded from the town charter: they necessarily had their place in it subject to the \"express modification\" made by section 193 of the town charter of 1903. Articles 4178 and 4179 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec, 1888, therefore, do not conflict with the view I take of the effect of section 193 of the charter, which is that, for the Town of Fraserville, articles 4562 et seq. of the \"Towns Act\" (arts. 4178 et seq., R.S.Q., 1888), must be read as if article 4561 had been originally enacted in the terms of section 193 of the town charter. So reading them, it would, I think, be clearly impossible to hold articles 4562 et seq. applicable to outside expropriations under section 182 of the charter, enacted concurrently with section 193, and there is no reason for outside expropriations authorized by the amendment of 1906 being in a different plight so long as section 193 of the charter was left unaltered. The corporation in making these outside expropriations, whether under section 182 or under the amendment to section 183, was thus driven to resort to the provisions of the general expropriation law contained in articles 5754 (a) et seq. of the Revised Statutes of 1888 (54 Vict. ch. 38, sec. 1), which are expressly made applicable in all cases where powers of expropriation are conferred by a statute that does not determine the mode in which they are to be exercised. Counsel for the respondent contended that inasmuch as the power to expropriate outside the limits of the town for the purposes of its electric lighting system was not given by the town charter as consolidated in 1903, but was conferred only by an amendment of 1906, upon the adoption of that amendment the restriction effected by the words \"in the town\" in section 193 of the charter of 1903 should be deemed repealed by implication. I cannot agree with that contention. There is no repugnancy or inconsistency such as it requires as a foundation. It takes no account of the existence in the charter of 1903 of the provision made by section 182 for outside expropriations. Such an implied repeal as is contended for might possibly follow if the statutes did not contain the general provision above referred to for cases in which the mode of expropriation is not defined by the law conferring the right. But with that provision available necessity for extending the scope of section 193 does not arise, and short of absolute necessity there is no sufficient ground for an implication of repeal of the limitative words which it contains.\nThe ground of appeal, which should thus, in my opinion, prevail, is, no doubt, technical and, in view of the concluding sentence of article 5566 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec, 1909, as amended by 1 Geo. V., ch. 56, sec. 19, is of no importance except in the present case. Yet it may not be rejected on that account since it involves the jurisdiction of the arbitrators.\nIf the provisions of articles 4562 et seq. of the Revised Statutes of Quebec, 1888, did not apply, the judge of the Superior Court usurped the jurisdiction conferred by articles 5754d and 5754e (54 Vict. ch. 38, sec. 1) on the Attorney-General of the province. The appellant has never acquiesced in the appointments made by the Hon. Mr. Justice Cimon, who purported to act as persona designata. Canadian Northern Ontario Ry. Co. v. Smith[4]. His order was not appealable. The respondent's plea of res adjudicata is, in my opinion, not well founded.\nI think I should add that upon the other grounds taken the appeal, in my opinion, fails for the reasons stated by the learned Chief Justice of the court of appeal,\nBrodeur J.\u2014Il s'agit d'un appel de la d\u00e9cision de la Cour du Banc du Roi, qui a confirm\u00e9 unanimement un jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure dans une action en nullit\u00e9 de sentence arbitrate.\nLa Ville de Fraserville, l'intim\u00e9e, d\u00e9sirant exproprier certains terrains appartenant \u00e0 l'appelant et dont elle avait besoin pour son syst\u00e8me d'\u00e9clairage, a donn\u00e9 avis d'expropriation sous les dispositions de l'acte des corporations de ville de 1888; et, comme l'appelant refusait de nommer son propre arbitre et le tiers arbitre, la corporation intim\u00e9e s'est adress\u00e9e \u00e0 un juge de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure pour faire la nomination (arts. 4565-4569a S.R.Q., 1888).\nL'appelant a comparu devant le juge et a pr\u00e9tendu que la corporation n'avait pas le droit de s'approprier les terrains en question parce qu'ils \u00e9taient en dehors du territoire dans lequel elle pouvait exercer son droit d'expropriation.\nLe juge, ayant d\u00e9bout\u00e9 l'appelant de ses pr\u00e9tentions et ayant donn\u00e9 acte \u00e0 ce dernier de ses objections, a nomm\u00e9 comme l'arbitre de l'appelant celui qu'il lui avait d\u00e9sign\u00e9 et il a \u00e9galement nomm\u00e9 le tiers arbitre.\nL'arbitre de l'appelant et le tiers arbitre ont rendu une sentence arbitrale par laquelle on lui accordait une somme de pr\u00e8s de $5,000.\nL'arbitre de la corporation \u00e9tait d'opinion qu'une somme moindre devait \u00eatre pay\u00e9e. La decision de la majorit\u00e9 des arbitres fut accept\u00e9e par la corporation et le montant fut d\u00fbment offert. Il ne peut donc y avoir de contestation s\u00e9rieuse quant au montant de l'indemnit\u00e9.\nL'appelant pr\u00e9tend cependant avoir droit \u00e0 une plus forte somme. Mais comme les trois arbitres sont d'opinion que le montant offert l'indemnise suffisamment et comme ils ont proc\u00e9d\u00e9 d'une mani\u00e8re juste, l\u00e9gale et \u00e9quitable, la sentence arbitrale de la majorit\u00e9 d\u00e9vrait \u00eatre maintenue.\nL'appelant demande en outre que la sentence soit mise de c\u00f4t\u00e9 sur le principe (1) que la nomination de son arbitre et du tiers arbitre aurait due \u00eatre faite non pas sous les dispositions de l'acte des corporations de ville (art. 4565 et 4569a) mais sous les dispositions de l'acte g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des expropriations de 1890 (54 Vict. ch. 38), (2) que la corporation n'avait pas les pouvoirs statutaires requis pour exproprier ses terrains.\n1.\u2014Nomination des Arbitres.\nLa ville de Fraserville \u00e9tait r\u00e9gie lors de l'expropriation en question, en 1908, par un acte sp\u00e9cial de 1903 (3 Edw. VII. ch. 69) et par l'acte g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des corporations de ville (arts. 4178 et suivantes des Statuts Refondus de 1888).\nL'acte g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des expropriations de 1890 (54 Vict. ch. 38) d\u00e9clarait que ses dispositions s'appliquaient aux cas o\u00f9 la l\u00e9gislature n'avait, pas autrement pourvu au mode d'expropriation.\nIl y \u00e9tait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que si une partie refusait de nommer son arbitre alors l'autre partie pouvait demander au Procureur-G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la province de faire la nomination d'un seul arbitre. Et si chaque partie avait choisi son arbitre alors le tiers arbitre \u00e9tait nomm\u00e9 par le Procureur-G\u00e9n\u00e9ral.\nDans l'acte des corporations de ville le pouvoir d'expropriation pour une ville \u00e9tait d'abord d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9 par l'article 4561 S.R.Q. (1888) et les articles suivants (4562 \u00e0 4570) d\u00e9terminent la proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre dans les expropriations.\nDans les articles 4565 et 4569a il y est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que si une des parties refuse de nommer son arbitre ou le tiers arbitre, alors un juge de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure aura jurisdiction pour faire cette nomination.\nAlors la diff\u00e9rence entre l'acte g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des expropriations et l'acte des villes c'est que dans le premier cas le Procureur-G\u00e9n\u00e9ral fait les nominations d'arbitres et que dans le cas des expropriations par des villes elles sont faites par le juge de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure.\nL'appelant pr\u00e9tend que \"l'acte G\u00e9n\u00e9ral des Expropriations\" s'applique au cas actuel parce que les terrains sont en dehors de Fraserville vu que la l\u00e9gislature, dans le cas de Fraserville, aurait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le mode d'expropriation des corporations de ville ne s'appliquerait que dans le cas o\u00f9 les expropriations auraient lieu dans les limites de la ville.\nIl se base sur la section 193 de l'acte sp\u00e9cial de 1903 qui a rappel\u00e9 l'article 4561 des corporations de ville et l'a remplac\u00e9 par un nouveau.\nL'article 4561, tel que nous le trouvons dans les Statuts Refondus de 1888, se lisait comme suit:\u2014\nLe conseil peut s'approprier le terrain n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution des travaux ordonn\u00e9s par lui dans les limites de ses attributions en se conformant aux dispositions suivantes.\nL'amendement fait par la section 193 de la charte de Fraserville est comme suit :\u2014\n193. L'article 4561 des Statuts Refondus est remplac\u00e9 pour la ville par le suivant:\nLe conseil pourra s'approprier, dans la ville, le terrain et les b\u00e2timents ou constructions n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution des travaux ordonn\u00e9s par lui dans les limites de ses attributions, en se conformant aux dispositions suivantes.\nCet article 4561 des Statuts Revis\u00e9s de 1888 avait pour but, comme on le voit, de donner aux villes le droit d'expropriation. Comme il ne r\u00e9f\u00e9rait pas aux b\u00e2tisses, il fut d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans le cas de Fraserville d'ajouter ces mots \"et les b\u00e2timents ou constructions\" au mot terrain afin de rendre bien clair le droit de la ville de Fraserville d'exproprier non-seulement les terrains mais les b\u00e2tisses qu'on y aurait \u00e9rig\u00e9es. Et il \u00e9tait d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9 aussi en m\u00eame temps que ces expropriations ne pouvaient se faire que dans la ville. C'\u00e9tait en 1903 que l'article 4561 fut ainsi amend\u00e9. Mais en 1906 de nouveaux pouvoirs d'expropriation, furent accord\u00e9s \u00e2 la ville pour son syst\u00e8me d'\u00e9clairage et cette fois la ville ne fut pas restreinte \u00e0 son propre territoire mais on lui a donn\u00e9 le pouvoir d'aller en dehors dans les municipalit\u00e9s a voisinantes.\nLa l\u00e9gislature, cependant, lui a donn\u00e9 ce pouvoir additionnel non pas en retranchant les mots \"dans la ville\" de l'article 4561 tel qu'amend\u00e9 en 1903 mais en faisant une nouvelle section. Cette nouvelle section est claire et non ambigue et personne ne pr\u00e9tendra qu'elle ne met pas \u00e0 n\u00e9ant les restrictions impos\u00e9es par l'article 4561 tel qu'amend\u00e9.\nSi par la loi de 1903 la ville de Fraserville ne pouvait exproprier que dans les limites de son territoire pour son syst\u00e8me d'\u00e9clairage, l'amendement de 1906 lui donne clairement le droit d'aller au dehors de son territoire pour perfectionner son syst\u00e8me d'\u00e9clairage.\nCes deux dispositions sont donc contradictoires et quoique l'article 4561, tel qu'adopt\u00e9 en 1903, n'ait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 formellement rappel\u00e9 en 1906 il devient incompatible avec la loi de 1906 et alors la derni\u00e8re doit pr\u00e9valoir, vu qu'elle contient la volont\u00e9 du l\u00e9gislateur telle qu'exprim\u00e9e en dernier lieu.\nLord Tenterden disait dans la cause de The King v. The Justices of Middlesex[5] :\u2014 Where the proviso of an Act of Parliament is directly repugnant to the purview of it, the proviso shall stand and be held a repeal of the purview, as it speaks the last intention of the makers.\n\"The usual rule as stated\" par sa seigneurie le juge Farwell dans la cause de In re Cannings and County Council of Middlesex[6] :\u2014\nis that where there are two public general Acts with inconsistent provisions the later Act prevails.\nLa proc\u00e9dure en expropriation qui doit \u00eatre suivie pour les terrains situ\u00e9s en dehors du territoire d'une ville est celle indiqu\u00e9e par les articles 4562 et suivants S.R.Q.\nEn vertu de Particle 4178, qui est le premier article de l'acte des corporations de ville, il est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que:\nles dispositions du present chapitre s'appliquent \u00e0 toute municipalit\u00e9 ou corporation de ville \u00e9tablie par la l\u00e9gislature de cette province, et \u00e0 moins de modification ou d'exception expresse font partie de la charte.\nL'article 4179 est encore plus explicite et dit:\u2014\nPour empecher l'incorporation de quelques articles du pr\u00e9sent chapitre dans la charte, elle doit les en exclure express\u00e9ment en les d\u00e9signant par leurs num\u00e9ros d'ordre.\nO\u00f9 se trouve la disposition de la charte de Fraserville qui d\u00e9clare express\u00e9ment en les d\u00e9signant par leurs num\u00e9ros d'ordre que les articles 4562 et suivants ne font pas partie de sa charte?\nY a-t-il dans la charte de Fraserville une seule disposition qui d\u00e9clare express\u00e9ment que les articles 4565 et 4569a qui pourvoient \u00e0 donner au juge jurisdiction pour la nomination des arbitres ne font pas partie de sa charte? Il n'y en a aucune.\nL'article 4561 invoqu\u00e9 par l'appelant ne s'occupe pas particuli\u00e8rement de la proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre dans les expropriations mais d\u00e9termine le droit lui-m\u00eame d'expropriation. Et quant \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre, les dispositions des articles 4562 et suivants s'appliquent et il serait ill\u00e9gal d'avoir recours \u00e0 la loi g\u00e9n\u00e9rale d'expropriation qui ne s'applique pas aux corporations de ville.\nLa nomination des arbitres a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00fbment et l\u00e9galement faite par le juge de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure.\nL'appelant d'ailleurs ne souffre aucune injustice puisque la corporation consent \u00e0 lui payer le montant que son propre arbitre a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de lui donner.\n2.\u2014Pouvoir D'Expropriation.\nUn autre point qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9galement soulev\u00e9 par l'appelant est que la ville de Fraserville ne pouvait pas exproprier son terrain parce qu'il ne se trouvait pas dans une municipalit\u00e9 avoisinante.\nLa rivi\u00e8re et le lac en question sont situ\u00e9s \u00e0 environ une quinzaine de milles de Fraserville. La ville, pour maintenir son syst\u00e8me d'\u00e9clairage, \u00e9tait \u00e9videmment oblig\u00e9e d'aller en dehors pour alimenter son pouvoir d'eau. A certaines saisons de l'ann\u00e9e la rivi\u00e8re o\u00f9 elle prenait son pouvoir s'ass\u00e9chait et ne pouvait fabriquer la lumi\u00e8re n\u00e9cessaire.\nIl paraitrait que le lac et le cours d'eau poss\u00e9d\u00e9s par l'appelant \u00e9tait les seules propri\u00e9t\u00e9s propices qui existaient dans les environs. Il s'agaissait de faire avec ces lacs et ces cours d'eau des r\u00e9servoirs qui conserveraient l'eau que l'on distribuerait ensuite dans le cours de l'\u00e9t\u00e9, lorsque le cours d'eau o\u00f9 la ville prenait son pouvoir s'ass\u00e8cherait. Elle a alors obtenue, en 1906, le droit d'exproprier des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s en dehors de son territoire par le statut (6 Edw. VII., ch. 50, sec. 6) qui d\u00e9clare qu'elle pourra:\u2014\nObliger les propri\u00e9taires ou occupants de tous terrains ou propri\u00e9t\u00e9s dans ou en dehors de la ville et les municipalit\u00e9s avoisinantes, \u00e0 laisser faire sur leurs propri\u00e9t\u00e9s tous les travaux n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 la construction, au maintien et \u00e0 la r\u00e9paration du systeme d'\u00e9clairage \u00e9lectrique, et le conseil pourra exproprier tout terrain n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 cette fin, sauf indemnit\u00e9 pour les dommages r\u00e9els caus\u00e9s \u00e0 tels terrains ou propri\u00e9t\u00e9s.\nOn se sert de l'expression municipalit\u00e9s avoisinantes dans la version fran\u00e7aise, des mots \"adjoining municipalities\" dans la version anglaise.\nLe mot \"adjoining\" me para\u00eet un peu plus restreint que celui \"d'avoisinant\"; et comme en vertu de la charte de Fraserville, sec. 297, il est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que dans le cas de divergences entre la version fran\u00e7aise et la version anglaise la version fran\u00e7aise sera adopt\u00e9e de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence, je dis que nous devons alors consid\u00e9rer tout particuli\u00e8rement le mot \"avoisinant.\"\nLe mot \"avoisinant\" veut dire \u00eatre \u00e0 proximit\u00e9 d'un lieu, ne veut pas n\u00e9cessairement dire imm\u00e9diatement voisin.\nD'ailleurs le l\u00e9gislateur avait tellement peu en vue les municipalit\u00e9s attenantes \u00e0 la ville qu'il n'y en a qu'une seule, savoir la paroisse de la Rivi\u00e8re du Loup qui entoure Fraserville. Quand il a autoris\u00e9, par cons\u00e9quent, la ville de Fraserville \u00e0 exproprier dans les municipalit\u00e9s avoisinantes, il voulait \u00e9videmment parler des municipalit\u00e9s qui se trouvent \u00eatre \u00e0 une certaine proximit\u00e9, mais qui ne sont pas n\u00e9cessairement attenantes \u00e0 la ville.\nLes terrains en question sont \u00e0 une quinzaine de milles de la ville. Ce sont les seuls que la ville pouvait exproprier pour son syst\u00e8me d'\u00e9clairage. C'\u00e9tait certainement ceux qu'elle avait en vue quand elle s'est fait autoriser par la l\u00e9gislature. Alors il ne peut pas y avoir de doute, suivant moi, que la corporation avait le droit d'exproprier les terrains de l'appelant. Pour toutes ces raisons, je consid\u00e8re que le jugement qui a renvoy\u00e9 l'action du demandeur est bien fond\u00e9e et doit \u00eatre confirm\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: St. Germain, Gu\u00e9rin & Raymond.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Lapointe, Stein & Lev\u00e8sque.\n[1] 42 Can.

The unloading of the rails was for the convenience of the company in using them to replace other rails already in use on the constructed tracks. An action was brought to recover damages, under the Manitoba \"Employers' Liability Act,\" R.S.M., 1913, ch. 61, within two years from the time of the accident, the limitation provided by section 12 of that Act, but after the expiration of the limitation of one year provided, in respect of actions against Dominion railway companies, by the first sub-section of section 306 of the \"Railway Act,\" R.S.C, 1906, ch. 37. The fourth sub-section of section 306 provides that such railway companies shall not be relieved from liability under laws in force in the province where responsibility arises.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from (25 Man. R. 655), that, in the exercise of authority in respect of railways subject to its jurisdiction, the Parliament of Canada had power to enact the first sub-section of section 306 of the \"Railway Act,\" R.S.C, 1906, ch. 37, providing a limitation of one year for the commencement of actions against Dominion railway companies for the recovery of damages for injury sustained by reason of the construction or operation of the railway. Grand Trunk Rway. Co. v. Attorney-General for Canada ((1907) A.C. 65), applied.\nPer Fitzpatrick, C.J. and Davies, Anglin and Brodeur JJ. (Idington J. contra).\u2014The fourth sub-section of section 306 of the \"Railway Act,\" R.S.C., 1906, ch. 37, does not so qualify the limitation provided by the first sub-section thereof as to admit the application, in such cases, of a different limitation provided under provincial legislation. Greer v. Canadian Pacific Rway. Co. (51 Can, S.C.R. 338) followed.\nThe unloading of rails for the convenience of a railway company to be used in replacing those already in use on the constructed permanent way is included in \"operation of the railway\" under the first sub-section of section 306 of the \"Railway Act,\" R.S.C., 1906, ch. 37. Idington J. contra.\nThe judgment appealed from (25 Man. R. 655) was reversed, Idington J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1], affirming the judgment maintaining the plaintiff's action entered by Prendergast J. on the verdict of the jury at the trial.\nThe circumstances of the case are stated in the headnote.\nO. H. Clark K.C. for the appellants. The judgment appealed from is erroneous in holding that subsection 4 of section 306 of the Dominion \"Railway Act\" restricts the application of sub-section 1 of that section to causes of actions which do not arise under the laws of the province where the liability was incurred. We refer to Greer v. Canadian Pacific Rway. Co.[2], per Anglin J. at page 351; Canadian Pacific Rway. Co. v. Roy[3], and West v. Corbett[4]. Under the laws in force in Manitoba, an action by a servant against his master for common law negligence must be begun within six years, and if brought under the \"Employers' Liability Act\" it must be brought within two years. The effect of section 306 is to cut down the time for bringing a common law action against a Dominion railway company to one year and, therefore, a servant suing a Dominion railway company for common law negligence is restricted to one year. It follows that a servant suing a railway company for negligence under the \"Employers' Liability Act\" would have to bring his action within the same time.\nM. J. Gorman K.C. for the respondent. The injury was not sustained by reason of the \"construction or operation\" of the railway. The work upon which the appellants were engaged at the time of the accident was a work of renewal or maintenance, and not of construction or operation. The real proximate cause of the injury was the negligence of the appellants' foreman in using a defective roller. That is not \"construction or operation\" of the railway, or any part of it, but the negligence of a foreman who so carelessly exercised his superintendence that the injury was sustained. Canadian Northern Railway Co. v. Robinson[5], per Davies J. at page 397, Duff J. at page 401, and Anglin J. at page 409; and, on the appeal to the Privy Council[6], per Lord Haldane at page 745.\nSub-section 2 of section 306 limits the application of sub-section 1 to those cases where \"the damages or injury alleged were done in pursuance of and by the authority of this Act or of the Special Act.\" The action of the appellants in replacing rails was not done in pursuance of and by the authority of the Act. There was no duty imposed by the Act to do this. It has not even been suggested that it was necessary. It was a purely voluntary act, not founded upon any duty or responsibility. Nor was the negligent, action of the foreman in using the defective roller done in pursuance of and by the authority of the Act. Lyles v. Southend-on-Sea Corporation[7], per Vaughan O. H. Clark K.C. for the appellants.\nM. J. Gorman K.C. for the respondent.\nWilliams, L.J., at page 13. The limitation applies only to actions brought in respect of injuries caused directly, and not indirectly, by the construction or operation of the road, and is not intended to apply to suits founded upon injuries to civil rights unconnected with railway legislation in its true sense. The appellants are subject to the provisions of the \"Employers' Liability Act,\" R.S.M., 1913, ch. 61, sec. 12, providing a limitation of two years for the commencement of actions. Canada Southern Rway. Co. v. Jackson[8].\nSub-section 4 of section 306 qualifies sub-section 1 and excludes its operation where the injury complained of comes within the jurisdiction of and is specially dealt with by the laws of the province in which it takes place, provided that such laws do not interfere with the powers of the Dominion Parliament respecting railway legislation. By its position in the Act, it applies against the railway company provincial laws imposing liability for wrongful acts or negligence so far as these laws do not encroach upon Dominion powers. Sub-section 1 prescribes the limitation in the case of actions for damages arising within the provisions of the \"Railway Act,\" while sub-section 4 makes it clear that there was no intention to affect the laws in force in any of the provinces where a liability of a company arises under those laws or to impose a limitation less than that imposed by the provincial law. British Columbia Electric Railway Co. v. Turner[9], per Idington J. at page 487; Abbott, Railway Law, page 209; Maxwell on Statutes (5 ed.), page 463.\nSection 306 applies only to cases in which the damage arises from the execution or neglect in the execution of the powers given to or bon\u00e2 fide assumed by companies enabling them to construct and maintain their railway, and does not and was not intended to apply to cases where damages have been caused by reason of the default or neglect of a company or its servants in the construction or operation of the road. North Shore Rway. Co. v. McWillie[10], per Gwynne J. at page 514.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The plaintiff's claim for damages is alleged in his factum to have arisen in these circumstances:\u2014\nThe plaintiff was a labourer and at the time of receiving the injury he was employed with others by the defendant in unloading steel rails from a box car, in which they had been shipped to the defendant, to a flat car, for more convenient distribution along the railway. The company at the time was replacing the old track with heavier rails.\nIt appears, therefore, that the injury complained of was sustained by reason of the construction and operation of the railway and the question to be decided is, does the limitation of section 306, para. 1 of the \"Railway Act\" apply, the action not having been commenced within the year.\nAssuming, as I think we must, that it was competent to the Dominion Parliament to pass this legislation I am satisfied that the language of paragraph 1 is sufficiently comprehensive to include all claims for damages, whether they arise at common law or under a statute. The claim was originally made at common law and under the statute, but was finally submitted to the jury as an action under the provincial \"Workmen's Act.\"\nI have reluctantly come to the conclusion that paragraph 4 of section 306 gives the respondent no assistance. That paragraph is applicable to the cause of action and means that if an accident occurs for which the company would be liable either at common law or under some special provincial statute, nothing contained in the Act, and no inspection had under the Act, will in any wise diminish or affect any such liability or responsibility. Here it is admitted that there was originally a good cause of action, but the suit to enforce the claim was not brought within one year next after the occurrence out of which the cause of action arose. Prescription under the civil law is a manner of discharging a debt by lapse of time. A debt or obligation, on the other hand, is not affected by a statute which says it may not be enforced after a certain period of time. The statute, in paragraph 1, does not affect the cause of action, it merely fixes one year as a reasonable time within which an action may be brought to enforce that right of action.\nI do not think that the case of Greer v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[11] is applicable. The courts below disposed of that case on the ground that the injury complained of was caused by something done in pursuance and by authority of the \"Railway Act,\" (per Anglin J. at page 350), and in that conclusion the majority of this court concurred. Here we have to deal with a case of negligence.\nI would allow although with much regret.\nDavies J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal must be allowed. I cannot doubt that the injuries of which the plaintiff complains were sustained by him \"by reason of the construction or operation of the railway\" within the meaning of those words in section 306, ch. 37 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1906, the Dominion \"Railway Act,\" nor do I doubt that sub-section 1 of that section was intra vires of the Dominion Parliament. The court below held, for different reasons assigned by the judges, that this section of the \"Railway Act\" was not applicable to the negligence complained of and that the limitation in the \"Employers' Liability Act\" of the province for bringing the action within two years was the governing section and not section 306 of the Dominion \"Railway Act\" which fixed the time at \"one year.\nAt the time, however, when the judgment was given the judgment of this court in the case of Greer v. Canadian Pacific Railway. Co.[12] had not been reported and was not called to the attention of the court below.\nThat case is now reported and determined that sub-section 1 of section 306 of the \"Railway Act,\" R.S.C. (1906) ch. 37, applied to injuries caused by the negligent construction or operation of the railway and that sub-section 4 did not restrict or affect the limitation in sub-section 1.\nI was one of the judges who dissented from the judgment in Greer's Case; but, of course, I am bound by it and I am quite unable to distinguish the appeal now before us from that judgment, though I freely admit the difficulty of reconciling the 4th sub-section of section 306 with the rest of the section.\nFor this reason I would allow the appeal and dismiss the action with costs it not having been brought within the limitation prescribed in section 306 of the \"Railway Act.\"\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014The only question raised herein is whether or not section 306 of the \"Railway Act\" can be relied upon as a bar to an action under the Manitoba \"Employers' Liability Act\" which enables a recovery for damages suffered by an employee under such circumstances as in question herein by action brought during the period of two years from the happening of the accident.\nThe Court of Appeal for Manitoba were unanimous in holding it was not, but Greer v. The Canadian Pacific Railway Company[13], though decided then, had not been reported.\nWhether the decisions of that case by the Ontario courts, which were reported, were cited or considered does not appear. They were accepted by the majority of this court as correct.\nThe only question now left is whether or not that case is distinguishable in principle from this.\nI, with great respect and some hesitation, find in the stress laid in the opinion of two of my brother judges, composing the majority deciding that case, upon section 297 of the \"Railway Act,\" that the cases are distinguishable.\nIt is conceivable that a burning of refuse including old ties on the track was rendered imperative by that section.\nIf that view is accepted, though it was not mine, then the company acting under the paramount authority of the \"Railway Act\" and discharging a duty created thereby could not be held bound by any Act of the legislature in conflict therewith and, as a corollary thereto, the applicability of the limitation of action in section 306 of the \"Railway Act\" may be arguable.\nThere is nothing of that sort in this case.\nIt cannot be pretended, at least so far it has not been since the legislation questioned in, and the decisions in the case of In re Railway Act of 1904[14], and the same case under the name of Grand Trunk Railway Company v. Attorney-General of Canada[15], that the \"Employers' Liability Act\" or similar legislation does not bind the railway companies.\nSubject therefore to the limitations imposed upon me by the decision in the Greer Case[16] thus understood, I remain of the opinion I expressed therein and for the reasons assigned in that case.\nThe case of Canadian Northern Railway Company v, Anderson[17] cited therein, in my opinion, seems much in point. That was a case arising out of work carried on for purposes of construction. The sole difference is that this is a case of a man engaged in the transportation of rails intended for construction or repair and renewal, and that was a case of a man engaged in procuring ballast to be transported and used in construction. Yet in that case leave was refused by the Judicial Committee to appeal from our decision[18].\nThe enactment of sub-section 4 of section 306, now in question, by the last revision of the statutes places it under the limitation clause therein as if germane thereto and thus emphasizes its purpose and effect.\nBut quite independently of such relation it is in substantially the same form in which it has remained ever since the session of 1868, immediately after Confederation; and was obviously designed by the change of expression then adopted to render effective just such provincial legislation as now in question.\nIt helps nothing to trace its history beyond the enactment of said 31 Vict. ch. 68, sec. 40, when the laws of a province were excepted as well as anything in the \"Railway Act\" itself.\nThe argument set up in the appellant's factum that to give effect to it in the way contended for in the judgments of the learned judges of the court below, would destroy the effect of the decision in Roy v. The Canadian Pacific Railway Company[19] is answered by the fact that it was relied upon therein and held not to have such effect.\nTo give effect to the argument herein for appellant would go a long way to destroy sub-section 4 of any efficacy whatever. As a matter of law I incline to think the section never was necessary to protect those entitled to claim under such legislation as the \"Workmen's Compensation Act\" or the \"Employers' Liability Act\" in question here. But it clearly was the design of the Parliament of Old Canada in providing against railway accidents, of which some shocking illustrations were present to the minds of everyone in the Canada of those days and doubtless led to the enactment of the statute in which the substance of this section is first found.\nIt was intended no doubt to brush aside any possibility of any one ever arguing that such provisions as then enacted were intended to affect the civil rights of any one.\nThat was, as already stated, extended to protect the right of any one acquiring rights under provincial legislation from anything in the \"Railway Act\" including the section, now section 306, sub-sections 1 and 2.\nAgain it was at the same time as the Act was revised, in 1903, that this section was placed as a subsection of section 242 in that Act. The character of that revision was radical in many respects and intended to protect the public in many ways as, for example, by the creation of a Board of Railway Commissioners and in relation to the very subject of the limitations of actions against railways, was so amended as to change the original words used in that regard \"by reason of the railway\" to the words \"by reason of the construction or operation of the railway\" and adding sub-section 2 which is now subsection 3 of section 306.\nThe railway companies had obtained conflicting decisions as to the meaning of the words \"by reason of the railway\" but never succeeded in bringing contracts within the range of that limitation. To make clear that it should not sub-section 2 of said section 242 was adopted. And, as if to make clear that provincial or other legislation should not be affected by the limitation clause, it put the present sub-section 4. of section 306 under the same caption.\nHowever clumsy the effort there cannot be much doubt of the intention to let it be treated as if part of the limitation and qualifying it.\nIt effectually did so if we should only read it literally by itself as preserving for those entitled to relief under any provincial legislation to the full effect thereof including the limitation of any action resting thereon.\nOf such legislation that now in question is part and must stand unimpeached or unaffected by a limitation statute designed for other purposes than in any way controlling or affecting anything save that strictly within the operation of the \"Railway Act\" itself.\nIf the usual rule governing statutory limitations of actions is adhered to, the text of section 306, sub-sections 1 and 2, cannot be extended to apply to such legislation as the Act in question herein and the collocation of sub-section 4 should put it beyond peradventure.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014For reasons which it deemed sufficient Parliament has thought it desirable to give to every railway company under its jurisdiction the protection of a statutory limitation of one year after the time when the damage has been suffered within which all actions or suits against it for indemnity for any damages or injury sustained by reason of the construction or operation of the railway must be brought. If this \"law is truly ancillary to railway legislation,\" although it should deal with and affect civil rights in the province and should overlap provincial legislation, it is intra vires and must prevail in cases which fall within its scope. Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Attorney-General for Canada[20]. Many reasons may be surmised why Parliament should consider it advisable, if not necessary, for the efficient and satisfactory working and management of their undertakings, that railway companies should be relieved from the necessity of preserving records of accidents and keeping available as witnesses for more than a year employees and other persons who may be in a position to give evidence as to them. With the merits of such a policy we are not concerned. So long as Parliament has not, under the guise of railway legislation, enacted what is not such but is truly legislation as to civil rights, its authority may not be questioned. I am unable to say that this vice is present in sub-section 1 of section 306 of the \"Railway Act,\" which, though frequently before the courts, has never been challenged as ultra vires. That the injury suffered by the respondent was sustained in the operation of the railway in my opinion does not admit of doubt. As their Lordships of the Judicial Committee said in Robinson v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[21],\nsuch operation seems to signify the process of working the railway as constructed.\nIn loading and unloading freight and goods upon railway cars the company's servants are assuredly engaged in the process of working the railway. It was negligence in the providing of means for such operation that caused the injury for which this action is brought. That actions based on such negligence are within the protection afforded by sub-section 1 of section 306 has been held in several cases in this court. West v. Corbett[22]; Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Robinson[23]; Greer v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[24].\nBut, it is urged., the Manitoba \"Employers' Liability Act\" gives a new statutory remedy for such an injury when sustained by an employee of the company and provides a special period of limitation within which an action under it may be brought. To such a case, it is argued, the general limitation of the Dominion \"Railway Act\" does not apply. I am somewhat at a loss to appreciate the ground of distinction suggested between rights of action arising under the common law of the province and rights of action created or conferred by provincial statutes where there is a question of the application to them of paramount Dominion legislation. The question is not, as it was in Robinson v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[25], which of two provincial limitation sections governs. If it were, a very strong argument could be made for applying the special provision found in the statute conferring the right of action. The question is whether a provision of a Dominion Act, framed in terms making it applicable to all actions against Dominion railway companies for infringement of civil rights in the course of the construction or operation of the railways which cause injury or damage, should be held inapplicable in cases where by provincial legislation a defence that would otherwise be available to railway companies, as employers, has been taken away, because the provincial legislation has annexed to the right to maintain an action in such cases the condition that it shall be brought within two years. The right of action in the present case, although it exists by virtue of the \"Employers' Liability Act\" having taken away the defence of common employment, is, nevertheless, for damages or injury sustained by reason of the operation of the railway and as such, in my opinion, falls within and is governed by the period of limitation prescribed by section 306 of the Dominion \"Railway Act.\" To hold differently would be improperly to allow otherwise valid provincial legislation to prevail over intra vires Dominion legislation in a field in which they overlap. Compagnie Hydraulique de St. Francois v. Continental Light, Heat and Power Co.[26].\nThe history and construction of sub-section 4 of section 306 were recently considered in Greer v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[27], and, for the reasons there stated by Mr. Justice Duff and myself, I am of the opinion that sub-section 4 does not render sub-section 1 inapplicable to the case at bar. The appeal should be allowed with costs in this court and in the Manitoba Court of Appeal, and judgment should be entered dismissing the action with costs.\nBrodeur J.\u2014I concur in the opinion of Mr. Justice Anglin. This appeal should be allowed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Clark & Jackson.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Murray & Noble.\n[1] 25 Man.

Jamieson (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nThe City of Edmonton (Defendant) Respondent\n1916: October 18, 19; 1916: December 11.\nPresent:\u2014Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies, Idington, Duff, and Anglin JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA.\nMunicipal corporation\u2014Maintenance of highways\u2014Improper use of sidewalk\u2014Damage by trespasser\u2014Notice of disrepair\u2014Nuisance\u2014 Negligence\u2014Injury to pedestrian\u2014Liability for damages. The municipal corporation was obliged, and given power, to maintain its highways in a reasonable state of repair, having regard to the character of the streets and the locality in which they were situated, and regulations had been enacted to prohibit vehicular traffic over the sidewalks except at crossings specially constructed in a manner to sustain such traffic. At a place where no such crossing had been provided vehicles had been, for over a year, habitually driven across a wooden sidewalk and no action to prevent such trespasses had been taken by the municipal authorities. During the afternoon of the day before the accident, a plank was broken by a heavy vehicle crossing the sidewalk and it continued in this condition until the evening of the following day when a pedestrian tripped in the hole and sustained injuries for which he brought action to recover damages.\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed from (9 West. W.R. 1287; 33 West. L.R. 851), Davies J. dissenting, that, in these circumstances, the municipal corporation was charged with notice of the condition of disrepair of its public sidewalk and, having failed to remedy the nuisance within a reasonable time, it was guilty of negligence involving liability in damages.\nPer Duff J.\u2014Section 507 of the charter of the City of Edmonton does not impose upon the municipality an absolute responsibility for harm suffered by individuals in consequence of a street being in a state of disrepair constituting a dangerous nuisance; but the municipality is responsible for the consequences of such a state of disrepair if, through the observance of proper precautions, it could have prevented the nuisance coming into existence: Hammond v. Vestry of St. Pancras (L.R. 9 C.P. 316), and Bateman v. Poplar District Board of Works (37 Ch.D. 272), applied. Proof of the existence of such a nuisance and resulting damage is, in itself, sufficient to create a prima facie cause of action against the municipality under section 507 of the charter.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], which reversed the judgment of McCarthy J. at the trial, and dismissed the plaintiff's action with costs.\nThe material circumstances of the case are stated in the head-note and the questions in issue on the present appeal will appear from the judgments now reported.\nChrysler K.C. for the appellant.\nLafleur K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This is an action brought by the appellant to recover damages for injuries caused by the defective condition of a sidewalk built by the corporation respondent for the use of the public.\nThe charter of the City of Edmonton (sec. 507) in express terms imposes upon the corporation the legal duty to keep the sidewalk in a reasonable state of repair and at the same time gives it authority to take all necessary measures to prevent the sidewalk becoming a danger to the public making use of it in the exercise of their right (sec. 237).\nIt is not disputed that the sidewalk was out of repair, that the appellant was making a proper use of it under the belief that it was in good condition and that as a result he was injured as alleged in his statement of claim.\nThere is in consequence no doubt that the appel- lant had a civil action against the respondent to recover compensation in damages for his injuries unless we are prepared to overrule the decision of this court in City of Vancouver v. McPhalen[2].\nAn action is given for breach of a statutory duty irrespective of whether the act done would be a wrong apart from the statute.\nIn Dawson v. Bingley Urban District Council[3], Farwell and Kennedy L.JJ. put the matter in this way: That where a person is one of a class for whose benefit a statutory duty is imposed, he is on breach of that duty entitled to maintain an action for damages occasioned to him by the breach unless the statute has indicated an intention to exclude that remedy.\nIn the case of Maguire v. Liverpool Corporation[4], Vaughan-Williams L.J. asserts the same general rule as do Farwell and Kennedy L.JJ. in the Bingley Case3, and treats the immunity of the authority in respect to the non-repair of highways as an exception due to the particular history of the highways. But in City of Vancouver v. McPhalen2, the distinction is very clearly made between those English cases in which the duty imposed is, as Sir Louis Davies says, one transferred from a body or authority on or with whom it previously rested and which body or authority was not itself liable in civil actions for nonfeasance (page 196) and cases in which the duty is created and imposed in the charter calling the corporation into existence. The general rule is that every public duty presumably gives rise to a private action in favour of a person injured by its breach and I know of nothing in the history of the highways in Edmonton which would justify creating an exception to that general rule in the case of breach by nonfeasance in respect to their repair.\nBut it is said that there is no proof of notice to the City of Edmonton of the existence of the hole in the sidewalk which caused the appellant's injury and that in consequence no liability attached. In City of Vancouver v. Cummings[5], Mr. Justice Idington speaking for the majority of this court said (p. 466):\u2014\nI am, despite dicta to the contrary, prepared to hold that, unless in some such case as I have suggested, the question of notice or knowledge does not arise, and that in all cases where the accident has arisen from the mere wearing out or apparent-wearing out, or imperfect repair of the road, there arises upon evidence of accident caused thereby, a presumption without evidence of notice that the duty relative to repair has been neglected.\nMy brother Anglin describes the circumstances under which the sidewalk became dangerous to the public using it and it is unnecessary for me to add anything to what he says beyond this. As a necessary consequence of the improper use to which it was put, to the knowledge of the corporation, the sidewalk became out of repair and a danger to those obliged to pass over it. The hole actually made in the sidewalk as a result of that improper use and which was the direct cause of the accident was allowed to remain unrepaired for over twenty-four hours, and the city police whose duty it was to report such conditions passed the place frequently. In these circumstances I am bound to hold, in view of the opinion expressed in City of Vancouver, v. Cummings5, that there arises a presumption without proof of notice that the duty relative to repair has been neglected. On the authority of Mersey Docks Trustees v. Gibbs[6], I would add, it must be taken as an established fact that the respondent had, by its servants, the means of knowing the dangerous state of the sidewalk, but was negligently ignorant of it. If the knowledge of the defect would make it responsible for the consequence of not having it repaired, it must be equally responsible if it was only through its culpable negligence that its existence was not known to them.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs.\nDAVIES J. (dissenting).\u2014After much consideration of the facts in this case I have reached the conclusion that the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta was right and that this appeal should be dismissed.\nI am satisfied with the statement of the facts and of the law as applicable to them made by the learned judges who formed the majority in the court below.\nAll the judges in that court held that as the city had not any actual notice of the break in the sidewalk which led to plaintiff's injuries sufficient time had not elapsed between such breakage and the accident to impute notice to them.\nThe evidence shews beyond doubt that the city had kept the sidewalk, which was for pedestrians only, in suitable repair for the purposes intended.\nI do not think there was any obligation upon the city to make the sidewalk stronger in order to accommodate trespassers who desired to cross it with loaded trucks or drays. Nor can I find any obligation existing on the part of the city to make a crossing at the place in question.\nThe liability of the city must therefore depend on their alleged negligence in enforcing the by-law, and it seems to me that the limit of the city's obligation in that regard was to prevent trespasses by prosecuting offenders.\nBefore liability can attach to the city for non-enforcement of a by-law an existing nuisance must be shewn to exist of which it had notice or be held to have had notice in law. Nothing of the kind existed here.\nMr. Justice Beck sets out in his judgment the provisions of the by-law relied on as, casting a duty upon the city and shews that they do not support the statement of the trial judge that the city could require an owner to put and keep a sidewalk abutting on his property in repair but merely prohibits him or any one else from crossing the sidewalk without taking steps to avoid injuring it. The learned judge adds that the most that might be expected of the city in the present case was that they should have prosecuted under the provisions of the by-law and he concludes (citing as authorities 14 Cyc. title \"Municipal Corporations,\" p. 1356, under the sub-title \"Failure to prevent improper use of streets\" and Dillon on Municipal Corporations, vol. 4, p. 1627) that no action can lie against the city for failure to enforce such bylaw except in cases amounting to a public nuisance.\nIn this opinion I agree and would dismiss the appeal.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The appellant recovered judgment against the respondent, a municipal corporation, for damages suffered by reason of his leg getting broken in consequence of the negligence of the respondent in failing to keep in a reasonable state of repair its sidewalk whereon he was walking.\nThe court of appeal for Alberta reversed that judgment and hence this appeal.\nThe duty of the respondent in the premises is defined by section 507 of its charter, which is as follows:\u2014\n507. The city shall keep every highway, including all crossings, sewers, culverts and approaches, grades, sidewalks and other works made or done therein or thereon by the city or by any person with the permission of the city, in a reasonable state of repair, having regard to the character' of the highway and the locality in which the same is situated or through which it passes.\nThe respondent had constructed the sidewalk, some six or seven years before the accident in question, of spruce planks, laid, I infer from the evidence, transversely to the line of the street, and supported by light scantling fit only to support pedestrian travel.\nAt the place in question there was a lane running at right angles to the sidewalk to serve the houses abutting thereon.\nIt turned out that teamsters who might have entered at the other end of this lane, with loads of any kind, got into the habit of using for their entrance or exit the end of the lane fronting on the sidewalk in question.\nIf the respondent had either protected the end of the lane next the sidewalk from any entrance, or built or caused to be built a proper crossing, by usual structure for such use, the sidewalk would have been in no danger of being broken as it was, and thus producing such accidents as this.\nInstead of doing so the respondent tolerated the use that was made continuously, for at least a year or more, next preceding the accident, of that means of entrance into the lane in question and thereby endangered the maintenance of the sidewalk, and consequently the safety of pedestrians.\nIndeed earth excavation, resulting from the execution of other work on the street at that point, was left lying as thrown there, while doing the work, long after such work was completed, and till some neighbour levelled it off and piled some of it up against the sidewalk so as to give it the appearance of a proper entrance to the lane and thereby invite just such traffic across the sidewalk as was sure to destroy it, and did destroy it twenty-eight hours before the accident in question.\nPlanks of the sidewalk had been worn out or destroyed by such use and the want of repair thus created was attended to more than once by the respondent's servants.\nEven when repaired there remained a breaking or chipping off of the ends of the planks in the sidewalk, so apparent to everyone, that no man, qualified for his job, when looking after the sidewalks could fail to recognize the notorious fact that this crossing use was being made of it, and was liable any day to break planks never intended to bear such traffic, and hence unfitted to meet the needs of pedestrian travel which demands safety.\nThat open and notorious use of the sidewalk and condition of things resultant therefrom, having existed by the negligence of the respondent for a year or more, it has the temerity to suggest that this case falls within that class of cases where courts have had to consider whether or not when an unavoidable, unexpected and improbable accident has put the highway out of repair, or wrong done by others had obstructed its use in a way of which the municipal authorities had no knowledge or notice, should be held to constitute negligence.\nNo court could properly find on the facts in question, in most of these cases, where the municipality was excused that there was negligence. Some of them may be very questionable. The usual statute in question in each of such cases made no provision for actual notice, indeed notice of any kind, but has been so interpreted as to render the question merely one of negligence in the discharge of a statutory duty, and in short the application of common sense.\nIn defining the law in such cases the term \"want of notice\" has been used sometimes when it was only intended to signify that the defendant might or might not, or should or should, not have known, if all reasonable means had been taken to observe and discharge the duty which the statute had imposed.\nThe short method of expressing the duty has led some people to imagine and loosely to assert that notice is actually necessary.\nIt has been time and again explained that the same degree of vigilance and the same condition of repair or maintenance could not be reasonably insisted upon in every case.\nThe highway that only serves a remote and sparsely settled district would not be tolerated in the centre of a large city, or serve its needs. The inspection demanded in the latter could not reasonably be required in the former. It comes to this that the section of respondent's charter quoted above expressly provides by the word \"reasonably\" what the law had already been determined by the courts to mean in cases where the statute merely imposed the duty of keeping in repair.\nIf a municipality persists in using a mode of construction and material fit only for pedestrian traffic, when its officers know that it is used also for loaded teams to cross, it has not discharged its obligations but laid a trap for its citizens getting their legs broken. All that has been urged about liability for non-observance of its own by-laws is quite beside the question involved.\nIt matters not whether there was a by-law enacted or not, or enacted only to be broken. No man could seriously consider the sidewalk as constructed at the point in question as fit for the use that it was being put to or a safe place over which to induce daily travel by pedestrians in a thickly inhabited part of the city. As well invite men to rely for crossing, by night and by day, a brook, upon a bridge which everyone concerned to know should, if thinking for an instant, realize will be swept away by the first storm that comes that way.\nIt is idle to point to the by-law forbidding such use when the breach thereof from week to week is tolerated. As well pass a by-law against storms in the illustration I put.\nIt is the maintenance of an insufficient sidewalk in a place notoriously needing something more substantial, or more rigorous means of warding off its destruction, than merely passing a by-law which nobody but its authors ever reads.\nThe powers the respondent had for enforcing the construction of a proper crossing at the point in question at the expense of those concerned in its use render the negligence of the respondent the less excusable. The appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the court below and the judgment of the learned trial judge be restored.\nDUFF J.\u2014The appellant one evening in November, 1914, after dark, stepped into a hole in a wooden sidewalk on Fifth Avenue, a street in Edmonton, with the result that his leg was broken. He sued the municipality for damages, basing his claim upon section 507 of the Edmonton City Charter, which is in the following words:\u2014\nThe city shall keep every highway, including all crossings, sewers, culverts and approaches, grades, sidewalks and other works made or done therein or thereon by the city or by any person with the permission of the city, in a reasonable state of repair, having regard to the character of the highway and the locality in which the same is situate or through which it passes.\nAt the trial before Mr. Justice McCarthy he succeeded; but the judgment given in his favour at the trial was reversed on appeal with the dissent of Mr. Justice Stuart.\nIn the immediate neighbourhood of the place where the accident happened there were some residences which had a lane or back area in the rear and for many months before the accident\u2014at least a year\u2014it was the practice for delivery vehicles entering this lane to pass over the place where the plaintiff met his injury; and the day before the date of the accident the sidewalk had collapsed under the weight of one of these vehicles.\nSome facts are admitted or so clear as not to be open to dispute. The sidewalk was not of sufficient strength to support traffic of the kind to which it was thus subjected. For the convenience of vehicles passing over this sidewalk an approach had been made by banking with earth the street side of the sidewalk opposite the lane and the sidewalk itself there shewed unmistakable evidence of the passage of wheels\u2014unmistakable, that is to say, to competent persons performing the duty of observing the condition of the sidewalk.\nIt was not disputed, I think, that in the condition in which the sidewalk was when the accident occurred the street was not in a \"reasonable state of repair\" having regard to \"the character of the streets and the locality in which it was situated\" within the meaning of sec- tion 507; and I have no difficulty in holding that if due diligence had been used by the municipality and those entrusted by the municipality with the care of the streets, that is to say, if diligence had been exercised of such a degree as to bring it into conformity with the standard supplied by the ordinary notions of sensible people, the sidewalk would not have been allowed to fall into that condition. Proper diligence would have led to the knowledge, by the persons responsible, of the fact that this sidewalk was being subjected to the burden of an extraordinary traffic\u2014a usage under which it was certain eventually to collapse; actuated by a reasonable respect for their duty, such persons on discovering the state of affairs, would have addressed themselves to finding means for the prevention of that which might be expected to happen in the absence of precautions, and which did in fact happen. They could have attained this object by stopping the traffic; or they could have attained it by strengthening the sidewalk.\nThe question to be decided on this appeal is whether in the circumstances the municipality is responsible in damages for the consequences of the neglect to take proper measures to prevent this sidewalk, under the effects of this traffic, falling into such condition as to amount to a nuisance. Section 507 is capable of being read as creating an absolute duty to prevent the highways of the city falling into a state of disrepair. There is, however, much to be said and there is a long line of authorities beginning with Hammond v. Vestry of St. Pancras[7], in support of the view that where duties of maintenance are, by enactments similar to section 507, cast upon a municipal body, the responsibility is not an absolute responsibility making the municipality in all circumstances answerable in damages for the existence of a state of things which the statute aims to prevent, e.g., a nuisance arising from the disrepair of a sewer; but that the public authority charged with such responsibility is not answerable if the state of things out of which the complaint arises is one which could not have been prevented or made innocuous by the observance on its part, and on the part of such agencies as it employed, or ought to have employed, of proper care and diligence. A highway may become a dangerous nuisance through a sudden operation of nature not reasonably forseeable, or from the mischievous act of some person for whom the authority charged with the care of the highway is not responsible and which it could not reasonably be held to be negligent or incompetent in not anticipating. In such cases and generally speaking in cases in which the state of things complained of can be shewn to have been something which the public authority could not reasonably have been expected to know or to provide against, it has been held that there is a good answer to any claim for reparation: Bateman v. Poplar District Board of Works[8]; Brown v. Sargent[9]; Blyth v. Company of Proprietors of Birmingham Waterworks[10]; Whitehouse v. Birmingham Canal Co.[11]. Under an enactment in the \"Ontario Municipal Act.\" to much the same effect as section 507, municipalities have uniformly been held to be exonerated in the absence of negligence. It may properly be assumed that section 507 was not enacted without reference to this course of decision and therefore, in construing that section, one is not without weighty sanction when giving effect to the considerations upon which these decisions rest. Strictly no question of burden of proof is here material. By the pleadings the onus of establishing an actionable breach of duty, is of course, on the plaintiff in the first instance. I express no opinion upon the question whether the effect of the statute itself is that where a nuisance is shewn to have existed in fact the onus is thereby cast upon the municipality to establish that the nuisance was not due to any cause for which it is responsible; in other words, whether or not there is a presumption of law arising from the existence of a nuisance\u2014in the condition of a highway\u2014that the municipality is responsible for it; a presumption that the municipality can only meet by establishing the negative of the issue. It is also strictly unnecessary to pass upon the question whether or not the plaintiff by proving the existence of the nuisance thereby establishes a prima facie case; although, as it is quite evident that the legislature in passing the enactment has assumed that in the ordinary course highways can be kept in a reasonable state of repair by the exercise of such diligence as may properly be expected from the municipality, there seems to be sufficient ground for holding that proof of the existence of a nuisance does in itself constitute a prima facie case throwing upon the municipality the burden at least of going forward with evidence. (See Blamires v. Lancashire & Yorkshire Railway Co.[12].)\nThe evidence before us in this case is quite sufficient, as I have already indicated, to shew failure to discharge the duty arising under section 507 for which the municipality is responsible.\nIt is argued that the municipality cannot be held responsible for the non-enforcement of its by-laws. In truth the municipality in the view expressed above is held responsible for allowing a nuisance to come into existence which could and ought to have been prevented. It was incumbent upon the municipality to use its powers of control on the highway to that end; and if the enforcement of the by-law had been its only means of effectively executing its duty, the municipality was bound to resort to that means. There is a passage in Lord Blackburn's judgment in Geddis v. Proprietors of Bann Reservoir[13], at page 456, that may be usefully quoted. It gives the principle which affords another answer to this argument:\u2014\nAnd I think that if by a reasonable exercise of the powers, either given by statute to the promoters, or which they have at common law, the damage could be prevented it is, within this rule, \"negligence\" not to make such reasonable exercise of their powers.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The plaintiff was injured through stepping into a hole in a sidewalk constructed by the defendant corporation on a city street where the traffic was considerable. The accident occurred at half-past seven o'clock on a November evening. The sidewalk had been broken down by a heavy load of coal driven over it on the afternoon of the previous day about four o'clock. The evidence shewed that the sidewalk had been constructed as an ordinary plank walk intended for use by pedestrians only, and that no provision had been made for the crossing of it by vehicular traffic at the point in question. A by-law of the city prohibited the crossing of sidewalks by horses and vehicles where protective timbering had not been provided for that purpose. Notwithstanding this by-law the place in question had been used throughout the whole of the year preceding the accident without any such protection as a crossing to a yard or private lane. The user had been of such a character and to such an extent that the learned judge found, properly in my opinion, that the city had notice of it. No charge of contributory negligence is pressed against the plaintiff. At the trial before McCarthy J. the city was held liable on the ground that there had been a breach on its part of a duty\nto have put and kept the crossing in a state of repair or to have required that the private owners of the property adjoining who used the crossing should put the same in a proper state of repair.\nThe Appellate Division of the Supreme Court reversed this judgment, holding that there was no obligation on the part of the city to provide a crossing, that its only duty in respect of the sidewalk was to repair it within a reasonable time after notice that it was out of repair and that notice actual or imputed of the existence of disrepair was not established. Mr. Justice Stuart, dissenting, held that because the municipal corporation knew that the sidewalk was being crossed continually by vehicles the place in question had the combined character of a sidewalk and crossing of a highway and should have been kept in a state of repair suitable to that character. He found that such a state of repair was not maintained. He also held that, having regard to such user and the character of the construction of the sidewalk, the city was called upon, if it did not desire to reconstruct so as to make the place suitable for a crossing for vehicles, to exercise greater vigilance in discovering breakages.\nBy its charter (sec. 507) the City of Edmonton is required to keep sidewalks constructed by it in a reasonable state of repair having regard to the character of the highway and the locality. This duty is imposed to ensure the safety of persons lawfully using the sidewalk and a breach of it entails liability in damages to such persons when injured in consequence: City of Vancouver v. McPhalen[14]. It must have been obvious to anybody giving the matter a moment's consideration that the user of a crossing oyer a sidewalk constructed as was that in question might result in its breaking down at any time. The user was certain sooner or later to put the sidewalk into a state of disrepair. I think it is not imposing upon the municipality an obligation greater than the legislature intended to hold that the duty to keep in a reasonable state of repair involves the duty to prevent, as far as reasonably possible, the continuance of known conditions which will bring about a state of disrepair, and, if the continued existence of such conditions is not prevented, to take precautions in the nature of extra inspection commensurate with the likelihood of a dangerous state of disrepair arising. Probably the safest and least expensive method of discharging its duty to keep in repair would have been to construct a proper crossing at the place in question. But, without holding that the municipality was under an obligation to construct such a crossing, or that failure to institute prosecutions for breaches of its by-law forbidding the crossing of unprotected sidewalks rendered it liable for damages, having knowingly permitted the continuance of forbidden and dangerous vehicular traffic involving risk of a break in the sidewalk at any moment, I think it cannot escape liability for injury sustained in consequence of a break occasioned by such traffic, after it had been allowed to remain unrepaired for more than a day. Whether such liability would arise in the case of an accident happening immediately, or very shortly, after the occurrence of a break it is not necessary now to determine. It may be said that this implies an obligation of at least daily inspection of a place such as that in question which would be too onerous to impose upon the municipality. But the necessity for such an inspection could have been so easily avoided, either by putting in a comparatively cheap crossing, which the city might have done on its own initiative, or by taking steps to prevent vehicular traffic crossing the sidewalk, which need have entailed no great trouble or expense, that the municipality can scarcely be heard to complain of the burden so imposed. Because, in my opinion, under the special circumstances in evidence it failed to take adequate measures for the fulfilment of its statutory duty to keep the sidewalk in a reasonable state of repair as a sidewalk, I would hold the defendant corporation liable.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs in this court and in the court appealed from and the judgment of the learned trial judge should be restored.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\n[1] 9 West.

Section 22 provided that before the work of constructing the canal was begun, the plans, etc., were to be approved by the Governor-in-Council.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from (16 Ex.

The only question dealt with by the Exchequer Court was whether or not such refusal entitled the company to claim damages and, holding that it did not, the court dismissed the petition. The suppliants appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada from that judgment.\nBrosseau K.C. and R. V. Sinclair K.C. for the appellants.\nNewcombe K.C., Deputy Minister of Justice, for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice (dissenting).\u2014From the reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice Cassels it appears that counsel for the suppliant and for the Crown came to an understanding that \"the question of law\" should be first argued. If there was any written consent to this course it is not in the record and I suppose the learned judge was therefore right in saying that the question was as to whether or not on the allegations in the petition the suppliant was entitled to succeed. It is a demurrer to the Petition of Right.\nNow I entertain no doubt that the statute 61 Vict., ch. 107, made a good and valid grant to the suppliant of the rights in respect of which the claim is advanced. The condition that the approval of the plans by the Governor in Council should be obtained before the works were commenced was a purely administrative matter. By this I mean that there was committed to the Governor in Council no power to consider the policy or advisability of the grant, that being a question which Parliament had undertaken to decide for itself. Parliament did not, as it often does, authorize the Governor in Council to take such action as he might think fit, leaving it to him to consider the matter and decide whether to make the grant or not. He has therefore no power to nullify the grant or in effect repeal the statute by an arbitrary refusal to exercise the power of approving the plans which for the proper carrying out of the works Parliament in the public interest has vested in him. It is said in the statement of defence that His Majesty did not refuse to approve the plans\nand if His Majesty did refuse such approval, the refusal proceeded upon high political grounds of public policy which were committed to the consideration of the responsible advisers of His Majesty.\nI do not think the statute committed anything of the sort to His Majesty's advisers.\nI cannot doubt that the grant made by the statute is in the nature of a contract and it is one of the highest order, His Majesty, in the words of the statute, granting by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons.\nThe provision for approval of the plans is a common one in such cases; it has reference only to the way in which the rights granted are exercised; the works proposed to be carried out must be reasonably suitable and proper and not opposed to public interests.\nIt is scarcely necessary to refer to cases in which such a provision as this is to be found. The approval is sometimes confided to the Governor in Council and at others to the heads of government departments especially concerned or others. The general railway Act is an instance. By sections 157-159 the company have first to submit to the Minister of Railways and Canals a map and information as therein mentioned for his approval, and after that has been obtained to deposit with the Board of Railway Commissioners a plan, profile and book of reference for their sanction; in section 168 there is the like provision that the company shall not commence the construction of the railway until such sanction has been obtained as in the statute with which we are here concerned.\nThe Minister of Railways or the Board may be of opinion that the railway is not wanted, is even objectionable, it may parallel another railway so as to render it impossible for either to be successfully operated, but they cannot by refusing their approval of the plans prevent the construction of the railway which Parliament has authorized.\nWe may usefully compare the provision in this case with sec. 7 of the Navigable Waters Protection Act, R.S.C., 1906, ch. 115, which provides that\nthe local authority, company or person proposing to construct any work in navigable waters, for which no sufficient sanction otherwise exists, may deposit the plans thereof * * * and may apply to the Governor in Council for approval thereof.\nUnder this section the Governor in Council might be in a different position with regard to giving or withholding his approval of the plans according as he might think the proposed work desirable or not.\nCounsel for the respondent has urged that the Crown is not mentioned in the statute and therefore by section 16 of the \"Interpretation Act\" is not bound. I do not think this section of the \"Interpretation Act\" has any application in such case; the section deals solely with the rights of His Majesty, which, it provides, shall not be affected by any Act unless it is expressly stated therein that His. Majesty shall be bound thereby. In the respondent's factum the Governor in Council is spoken of as the responsible adviser of His Majesty's Government for the Dominion of Canada, but I think this is rather absurd. The Governor in Council is the Governor-General acting with the advice of the Privy Council for Canada. This is the only Government of Canada I know of and it would therefore seem that the Governor in Council must be his own responsible adviser, I do not know who else he can be said to advise. I certainly think that the Governor in Council must here be considered as meaning the same thing as the Crown. The Governor-General carries on the Government of Canada on behalf of and in the name of the Sovereign (the \"Interpretation Act,\" sec. 34, paragraphs (6) and (7)). If this were an English statute, we should have a grant by the King in Parliament subject to the approval of the plans by the King in Council.\nThen I think that the King in Parliament having made this contract was bound to carry it out and to act with reference to the condition in accordance with the purpose thereof which certainly was not to destroy the grant; the advisers of the Governor in Council should rather in good faith have facilitated than opposed the undertaking.\nThis court could not undertake to review any decision at which the Governor in Council in the exercise of his discretion might arrive or weigh the reasons for the same. It is, however, another thing, that he should neglect or refuse to exercise the power of control reserved to him.\nIn the statement of defence the Attorney-General has pleaded a number of inconsistent defences as of course he was entitled to do, but in the 9th paragraph he alleges that\nThe suppliant did not submit to the Governor in Council for approval any plans, locations, dimensions or necessary particulars of the canals and works described or authorized to be constructed by the said statute, ch. 107 of 1898, nor were any such plans, locations, dimensions, or particulars submitted for the approval of the Governor in Council.\nNow this, assuming the facts alleged in the petition, is quite incompatible with there having been any exercise by the Governor in Council of the discretionary power reserved to him by Parliament.\nFor the purposes of the present proceedings, however, we can only look for the facts to the allegations in the Petition of Right and it is in the 14th paragraph alleged that the Crown without any reason has refused approval. It may be as the judge of the Exchequer Court says that this may mean without any reasons furnished to the suppliant, but I do not think this makes any difference. It may be that any defect in or objection to the plans could easily have been remedied or overcome and the suppliants were certainly entitled to have an opportunity of making such alterations.\nIf it was not to the mode of carrying out the works but to the undertaking being proceeded with at all, that there was objection, that, as I have said, was not a matter within the power of the Governor in Council at all.\nThe judge of the Exchequer Court says:\u2014\nThe Crown certainly would not be liable for the tort or wrong of the Governor in Council. It is too clear for argument that the Crown is not liable for damages in tort.\nWhilst there is no question that in England the Crown is not liable, I am not sure that the doctrine is applicable so strictly in this country. We have the authority of the Judicial Committee in the case of Farnell v. Bowman[2], for saying that if the maxim \"The King can do no wrong\" were always applied to colonial governments, it would work much greater hardship than it does in England. It was said in the judgment :\u2014\nJustice requires that the subject should have relief against the Colonial Governments for torts as well as in cases of breach of contract or the detention of property wrongfully seized into the hands of the Crown.\nIn such a case as the present I think the courts may well be disposed to lean in favour of affording relief to the suppliant.\nThat the claim is a meritorious one, seems clear. It would surely be an injustice if the suppliants after incurring large expenditures on the faith of a Parliamentary grant were to be deprived of all their rights not through any defect in their plans but because the Government did not approve of the undertaking and dissenting from the decision of Parliament could by withholding approval of the plans prevent altogether the carrying out of the works.\nIf necessary I should be prepared to hold that the suppliant is entitled to claim under sec. 20, paragraph (d), of the Exchequer Court Act which gives to the court jurisdiction over\nevery claim against the Crown arising under any law of Canada or any regulation made by the Governor in Council.\nI am of opinion that the allegations in the petition disclose a good ground of action and the appeal should be allowed.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellant was incorporated by Parliament but so far from giving its creature any right to complain it only gave a right to prosecute its proposed undertaking as the Governor in Council might, as a matter of public policy, see fit to approve of either as to location or dimensions or plans of construction.\nSection 22 of the \"Incorporation Act,\" which is clear and explicit in these regards, is as follows:\u2014\nBefore the company shall break ground or commence the construction of any of the canals or works hereby authorized, the plans, locations, dimensions, and all necessary particulars of such canals and works shall be submitted to and approved by the Governor in Council.\nIt seems idle to contend that such a conditional proposal as Parliament has sanctioned thereby constitutes a contract. And it seems equally absurd to contend that the Governor in Council entrusted by Parliament with such a duty can be said to have committed a tort of any kind, much less, a tort for or in respect of which a petition of right would lie, in discharging the duty thus assigned by withholding the approval sought by appellant.\nThe case thus presented falls very far short of coming within the scope of any of the decisions relied upon by appellant or the principles upon which any of them proceeded.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014The suppliant company was incorporated in 1898 (61 Vict. ch. 107) with authority to construct a ship canal between the St. Lawrence and the Richelieu Rivers and by section 22 of its special Act it was enacted:\u2014\nBefore the company shall break ground or commence the construction of any of the canals or works hereby authorized, the plans, locations, dimensions and all necessary particulars of all such canals and works shall be submitted to and approved by the Governor in Council.\nThe relevant allegations of the petition are those numbered 10 to 14 inclusively; they are as follows:\u2014\n10. That on or about the 30th of May, 1911, the plans, locations, dimensions and all necessary particulars of such canals and works were submitted to be approved by the Governor in Council, and duplicates of the same were deposited with the Department of Railways and Canals and the Department of Public Works in Ottawa.\n11. That since the 30th of May, 1911, your suppliant has repeatedly requested the approval of the plans by the Governor in Council.\n12. That all informations requested by the Department of Railways and Canals and the Department of Public Works in Ottawa have been duly furnished.\n13. That in granting a charter to your suppliant for the construction of said canal, the Crown took the engagement and obligation to approve the plans made in conformity with the charter.\n14. That the plans, locations, dimension and all necessary particulars for such canals and works were made in conformity with the requirements of the Secretary of War of the United States, and, notwithstanding the repeated and incessant request of your suppliant for approval, the Crown without any reason has refused to do so.\nBy the statement of the defence in paragraph 12 an objection was taken that the alleged refusal of the Governor in Council to approve the suppliant's plans\ndoes not constitute a cause of action for which a petition of right will he against His Majesty.\nThe point of law raised by this objection was argued on the first day of the trial and being decided adversely to the suppliant by the learned judge of the Exchequer Court, no evidence was given.\nThe allegations of the petition are ambiguous; and strictly, in accordance with the settled rule for the construction of pleadings, they should be construed against the suppliant. The suppliant's case must be taken on the pleadings so construed to rest upon an allegation that the Governor in Council has refused to approve plans submitted which ought to have been approved because they were sufficient and satisfactory. It requires no argument to shew that such an allegation if well founded would afford no ground of action against either His Majesty or the Governor in Council; it could not be argued that a decision of the Governor in Council not to approve plans submitted under section 22 is open to review in the courts. The decision in the Privy Council in McLean v. The King, 10th July, 1908, is a sufficient authority for holding that the question of the sufficiency of the allegations in a petition of right to disclose a cause of action, ought not to be disposed of as a preliminary question of law on a narrowly technical construction of a badly framed pleading but that for the purpose of such a question the suppliant should be held to be entitled to prove any cause of action disclosed upon any reasonable construction of the pleading. This appeal ought, I think, to be decided on the assumption that the pleading contains an allegation that the suppliant duly submitted its plans for the approval of the Governor in Council, but that the Governor in Council refused and refuses to exercise its authority under section 22 to consider such plans. The question to be determined therefore is whether such an allegation is sufficient to support the suppliant's claim by petition of right against His Majesty.\nThe question of substance argued before us was whether it can be affirmed that the enactment under consideration gives rise to a duty to the suppliant which (in the language of Cockburn C.J. in The Queen v. The Lords Commissioners of the Treasury[3]:\u2014\nhas to be performed by the Crown;\nbut assuming such a duty to be created the first point which naturally occurs to one is, does a petition of right lie against His Majesty for the recovery of unliquidated damages arising from the non-performance of that duty? I do not intend to decide the point because I do not understand the objection to be taken by counsel for the Crown who with fairness and candour, when the difficulty was mentioned, referred to section 20, sub-section (d), of the \"Exchequer Court Act;\" I do not think it is within the province of the court to insist in such proceedings upon technical objections which counsel representing the Crown does not (and quite properly) consider it to be his duty to raise. (Dyson v. Attorney-General[4]).\nDoes section 22 then give rise to a duty that\nhas to be performed by the Crown,\nwhich is a duty to the suppliant of such a nature as to be capable of vindication in His Majesty's courts? The suppliant's argument might in outline be stated in this way. The special Act is a contract between Parliament (the King in Parliament) and the promoters; section 22 imposes a condition with which the appellant is bound to comply in order to avail itself effectively of the rights assured to it by this legislative contract and the performance of that condition (getting its plans approved by the Governor in Council) being impossible without concurrent action by the Crown represented by the Governor in Council in considering the plans submitted for approval, the obligation is, on a familiar principle (Mackay v. Dick[5], at page 263, undertaken by the Crown to do that which is necessary to be done in order to enable the suppliant to fulfil the condition upon which its rights depend.\nIt should be observed that His Majesty is not mentioned eo nomine in the 22nd section, the provision upon which this argument rests; and it is sometimes not easy to ascertain where powers are by statute vested in a minister of the Crown whether the depositary of the powers is thereby constituted the \"agent\" of the Legislature (see the argument of Sir George Jessel, L.R. 7 Q.B. at page 389) to exercise those powers, an instance of that being Re Massey Manufacturing Co.[6]; see also Irwin v. Gray[7] and Fulton v. Norton[8]; or whether the powers are vested in the Crown to be exercised through the instrumentality of the minister, in other words, whether or not the Legislature has named the donee of the power in his capacity of servant of the Crown. (See an interesting discussion in Maitland's Constitutional History, page 415 et seq. and Lowell Government of England vol. 1 pages 48 and 49.) So here there might no doubt be room for an entertaining argument upon the point whether the authority to examine and approve under section 22 is an authority vested in His Majesty to be exercised by the Governor in Council, or an authority vested in the Governor in Council as \"agent\" of Parliament. The reasons which have led me to a conclusion adverse to the appellant's contention would apply with equal force in either view; and I shall assume in favour of the appellant that the authority given by section 22 is given to His Majesty, the Governor-General being the representative of His Majesty for exercising the powers conferred on the advice of His Majesty's Privy Council for Canada.\nNow I am far from saying (where a contract between the Crown and a subject conditionally confers upon the subject rights which become absolute only upon the performance of some act on the part of the Crown) that the principle of MacKay v. Dick[9] and Pordage v. Cole[10], may not in a proper case come into play; but in considering whether an implied obligation is laid upon the Crown under a written contract the constitutional relation between the Crown and Parliament and the exigencies of the public service may be the determining elements of the controversy (see Churchward v. The Queen[11], at pages 199 and 200). Although it is a common practice for some purposes to read the provisions of Acts of Parliament such as that before us as if they were stipulations in a contract between the promoters on the one hand and Parliament as representing the public and particular individuals who may be affected, on the other hand, it is necessary sometimes, nevertheless, for the sake of accuracy to insist upon the fact that such statutes are not contracts. As Lord Watson said in Davis v. Taff Vale Rly. Co.[12], at page 552,\nSuch statutes differ from private stipulations in this essential respect that they derive their existence and their force not from agreement of the parties, but from the will of the Legislature.\nThough speaking broadly the promoters may be deemed to undertake in effect that \"they shall do and submit to whatever the Legislature empowers and compels them to do;\" Lord Eldon in Blakemore v. Glamorganshire Canal Navigation[13], at page 162; still\nthough commonly so spoken of Railway Acts are not contracts and ought not to be construed as such.\n(Court of Exchequer Chamber, York and North Midland Railway Co. v. The Queen[14], at page 864); Parke and Creswell JJ. were members of the court of nine who delivered the judgment in which this sentence occurs. The statute before us confers, conditionally of course, upon the suppliant company wide powers which in their exercise must necessarily in some instances affect the rights of all His Majesty's subjects, and in others the rights of particular individuals. The statute imposes upon the promoters no obligation to go on with the undertaking and no contract on their part to exercise the powers which are given to them in words that are permissive only, ought to be implied. York and North Midland Railway Co. v. The Queen[15]. I think there is no authority which goes the length of requiring me to hold and I know of no principle that would justify me in holding in these circumstances that section 22 ought to be given exactly the same construction and effect as if it were a term of a contract between the Crown and the promoters.\nRegarding then the relevant provisions of the statute as legislative enactments simply from the point of view of the Crown, is there anything in section 22 when read either alone or with the other provisions of the statute, that has the effect of creating a juridical obligation which inheres in the suppliant and the incidence of which rests upon either His Majesty or the Governor in Council? Section 22, as I have already said, involves no doubt a grant of power to examine and either to approve or to reject; but is a duty to the suppliant to exercise the power also created cognizable by His Majesty's courts? In Julius v. Bishop of Oxford[16], there was much discussion by the great lawyers who decided the appeal upon the subject of the indicia which may be considered to point to the conclusion that a grant of authority by the Legislature is coupled with a duty to exercise that authority. We need not, for the purposes of this appeal, follow the discussion closely. At page 235 Lord Selborne observes with regard to the question before the House\u2014whether there was an enforceable duty to exercise a power admittedly conferred\u2014that\nin general, it is to be solved from the context, from the particular provisions, or from the general scope and objects, of the enactment conferring the power.\nAnd he adds:\u2014\nThe present question is, whether it can be shewn, from any particular words or provisions of the \"Church Discipline Act,\" or from the general scope and objects of that statute\nthat such a duty had in fact been created. The observations of Lord Cairns at pages 225 and 227, and of Lord Penzance at pages 229, 230, 231 and 232, shew that the question of duty or no duty was considered to be governed and determined by the answer to the question thus put by Lord Selborne. So the question to be answered on this appeal is whether from the language, scope and objects of this enactment an intention to create a duty in the sense above indicated can properly be inferred.\nIt may be noted that legislation investing the Governor in Council with special powers ought to be considered with reference to the well-known practice in this country, that is to say, that the council by whose advice in the passing of orders in council the Governor-General acts invariably, is composed exclusively of members of the Government for the time being, the Governor in Council being therefore de facto the responsible executive.\nMy conclusion is, that the body in whom the power is reposed being the executive directly responsible to Parliament, and there being such remedy for grievances of persons alleging non-execution of powers by the executive as the existence of this responsibility entails, one cannot from the fact itself of the power being given legitimately infer that a legal obligation is imposed on the Governor in Council (either as representing His Majesty or otherwise) in favour of the persons interested in having the powers exercised. I am unable to convince myself, apart altogether from anything to be found in the \"Interpretation Act,\" that such an inference could be said to be necessary, and it appears to me that such an obligation ought not to be held to be imposed upon either His Majesty or the Governor in Council unless either one finds express words creating it, or the intention to do so is necessarily implied in the provisions of the enactment to be construed.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\"\nAnglin J.\u2014The facts of this case and the grounds of the suppliant's claim sufficiently appear in the judgment of the learned judge of the Exchequer Court. With him I am unable to find in the appellant company's. \"Act of Incorporation\" (61 Vict., ch. 107) a contract by the Crown, for breach of which it would be liable in damages, that the Governor in Council would approve of plans of its projected works prepared in conformity with the powers conferred on it. The company's privilege or franchise is granted subject to the condition that before exercising its power it shall obtain the approval of the plans for its works by the Governor in Council. With that condition it has been unable to comply\u2014by reason, as it alleges, of the refusal of the Governor in Council to approve plans submitted by it. It complains that the powers conferred by its \"charter\" have consequently lapsed entailing a loss of five million dollars, which it seeks to recover from the Crown by a Petition of Right. If there was such a refusal of approval, according to the statement of defence of the Attorney-General, it was based not upon a consideration of the plans disclosing that the projected works were not within the authorization of the statute or that the method of construction proposed was either defective or otherwise objectionable, but\nupon high political grounds of public policy which were committed to the consideration of the responsible advisers of His Majesty.\nThe Attorney-General submits that the Exchequer Court\nhas no jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the quality of the decision of the Governor in Council in the execution of a statutory power conferred in the public interest.\nIf the statement that any refusal of approval of plans that there may have been\nproceeded upon high political grounds of public policy\nmeans that in so refusing approval the Governor in Council assumed to exercise a discretionary power to determine that it was not in the public interest that the appellants' undertaking, authorized by Parliament, should be proceeded with, I can only say that I have failed to find in the statute anything which confers such a discretion upon the Governor in Council or which warrants withholding on such a ground approval of plans duly submitted. Section 22, invoked by the respondent, in my opinion, does not bear the construction which counsel representing the Attorney-General sought to give to it. The company's right to exercise certain special powers conferred on it, such as improving, widening, deepening and straightening the Richelieu River and the Chambly Canal (sec. 20), and the taking of the Chambly Canal, or any lock, dam, slide, boom, bridge or other works, the property of the Government of Canada (sec. 22), is expressly made subject to the consent of the Governor in Council, and, in the case of an appropriation of any such public works, to terms to be agreed upon between the company and the Government. It is alleged in paragraph 16 of the statement of defence that the company's plans as submitted involved the exercise of these special powers. But this is denied in the suppliant's reply and in dealing with the question of law now before us the truth of that denial must be assumed. If it were not abundantly clear from the terms in which sec. 22 itself is couched, as I think it is, that it was not meant thereby to vest in the Governor in Council a discretionary power entirely to prevent the prosecution of the suppliants' undertaking by refusing on grounds of public policy to approve of plans duly submitted by them, which had been prepared in conformity with the statute and in compliance with all proper requirements, any possible doubt on that point would be removed by a comparison of those terms with the explicit provision made by Parliament in sections 20 and 21 in regard to matters as to which it was intended that the Governor in Council should exercise such control over the exercise of the company's powers.\nBut assuming that by sec. 22 Parliament meant to impose on the Governor in Council the duty of approving plans submitted to it for works authorized by the statute, prepared in conformity with any pertinent regulations or requirements of the Department of Railways and Canals or of the Governor in Council and such that any public interest in regard to the location of the works and the mode of their construction would be fully protected, it does not at all follow that it was intended that, upon failure to discharge that duty, the Governor in Council should be amenable to process in the Exchequer Court, still less that the Crown should be answerable to the company in damages. Assuming both the duty and its breach, the Governor in Council is, in my opinion, answerable therefor only to Parliament, which can afford an adequate and effective remedy to the suppliants should \"the high grounds of public policy\" upon which the Governor in Council may have proceeded not commend themselves to it and should it find that its will has been thwarted by the refusal or failure to approve of the suppliants' plans. It seems to me to be contrary to our conception of responsible government that the action of the executive department in such a matter as this should be subject directly or indirectly to the control of the courts.\nBrodeur J.

H., a New York creditor, obtained security by means of the debtor's promissory notes, drawn up and made payable in Toronto and indorsed by the defendant, residing in Montreal. The action on the notes was brought, in Quebec, against the indorser.\nHeld, per Idington and Anglin JJ., that the case should be decided according to the law of Ontario if there is any difference between it and the Quebec law on the subject-matter.\nJudgment appealed from (Q.R. 25 K.B. 421), affirmed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of King's Bench, Appeal Side, for the Province of Quebec[1], affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the defendant.\nIn the spring of 1913, one Grossman, a jeweller of the City of Toronto and brother-in-law of respondent, having become financially embarrassed in his business, called a meeting of his principal creditors, with a view of obtaining from them an extension of time.\nAfter some pourparlers with representatives of creditors present they all agreed to an extension of delay and a memorandum of extension of time was drafted and was submitted to the above-mentioned creditors and signed by Grossman, and his creditors, with the exception of appellants whose representative was not authorized to sign.\nShortly afterwards, Julius Hochberger, one of the appellants, came to Toronto, for the purpose of ascertaining the financial standing of their debtor, with special instructions as regards settlement to be made with him. During the course of the discussion, which took place with Grossman alone at Toronto, Julius Hochberger refused to consent to the proposed extension unless appellants' claim was secured and the promissory notes then offered in settlement be made at shorter dates.\nThe promissory notes sued upon in this case having been prepared by Julius Hochberger, Grossman sent them to respondent, at Montreal, with a request to indorse them. Respondent returned the notes to Grossman refusing to indorse unless he got more particulars about them.\nHaving been informed by Grossman that plaintiffs, appellants, would not consent to the extension unless their claim was secured, and knowing that Max D. Eisen, the representative of plaintiffs, in Toronto, had previously promised Grossman that Hochberber would supply him with certain goods to carry him along, and replenish his stock, he then and there consented to indorse the notes, not being told that appellants were to sign the memorandum of agreement for extension. Defendant, respondent, having returned the promissory notes to Grossman, at Toronto, never heard anything further about them until the following January (1914), when Grossman, being incapable of meeting his payments, had to make an abandonment of his property for the benefit of his creditors. An action was then brought against respondent as indorser.\nLafleur K.C. and Lamothe K.C. for the appellants.\nR. G. deLorimier K.C. and Amie Geoffrion K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe promissory notes sued on were obtained in execution of an agreement between the appellants and their insolvent debtor.\nThe defendant, indorser of the notes, was a brother-in-law of the maker, Grossman, a jeweller, of the City of Toronto, and the appellants were amongst the latter's creditors. The notes were given to induce the appellants to sign Grossman's deed of composition.\nAs Best C.J. said in Knight v. Hunt[2], at page 433, these agreements for composition with creditors require the strictest good faith. The principle to be drawn from all the cases on this subject is\nthat a man who enters into an engagement of this kind is not to be deceived.\nIt has been argued that here the debtor is not injured, nor the funds for the other creditors rendered less available, because the indorsation given and sued on was that of a third party who took no interest in the estate, but as the Chief Justice said in Brigham v. Banque Jacques Cartier[3], at page 436:\u2014 Upon a principle well established by the English courts such a payment by a third person is just as much a fraud on the general body of creditors as a payment or an agreement to pay by the insolvent debtor himself: Wells v. Girling[4]; Knight v. Hunt[5]; Bradshaw v. Bradshaw[6]; McKewan v. Sanderson[7]; Re Milner[8].\nPollock on Contracts (7 ed.), 293.\nThe one question which always remains is whether the judgment of the creditors has been influenced by the supposition \"that they are treating on terms of equality as to each and all.\" This is not a case of a gratuitous gift made after composition. Here there was a previous secret understanding that the appellants should receive security for their debt and a direct advantage over all the others who were contracting on the assumption that all were being treated alike. The notes sued on were given in pursuance of an agreement which was void as made in fraud of the other creditors of Grossman: Art. 990 C.C.; see also Ex parte Milner (5).\nIdington J.\u2014The appellants sued the respondent as indorser of six or seven promissory notes, remainder of ten or a dozen such, made by one Grossman and indorsed by respondent in order to satisfy the demands of appellants upon said Grossman, who had asked them to join in an agreement he was trying to obtain from a half dozen of his chief creditors for an extension of time. The agreement, as drawn up, had named one Eisen as one of the creditors intended to execute the agreement.\nEisen it turned out had no authority to sign being only an agent of the appellants.\nThis circumstance tends to confuse matters and the most has been made thereof. But as appellants signed the agreement and Eisen did not and there can be doubt of what was intended to have been accomplished by the substitution of appellants for Eisen in the way of signing and in fact I think was accomplished, the agreement should be treated as one of the ordinary kind for an extension by creditors of time to a debtor, who otherwise might be forced to make an assignment as an insolvent.\nOn such basis I agree with the late Mr. Justice Dunlop's construction of the clause in said agreement which reads as follows:\u2014\nThe first party agrees that he will not during the currency of this extension and until these liabilities are paid off give any preference or security on any of his assets no matter where situate without the consent of the second parties.\nWhat was done was clearly a preference, and none the less obnoxious because an ingenious method was resorted to of extracting something from the assets without the assent of other creditors.\nIt was circuitous but partially effective.\nThe notes given on the basis of the extension were to have been, and I think in fact were, for three, six, nine and twelve months.\nThe appellants got, in substitution thereof, notes spread over some twelve months, indorsed by respondent, divided into equal sums but payable monthly. Thereby, unless (which is not pretended) the money could be conceivably got elsewhere than out of the debtor's assets mentioned in above clause, the appellants got an improper advantage over others they held themselves out as joining.\nThen apart from the interpretation of the agreement the giving these notes was illegal.\nIt may be worth while to let those people, and others inclined to do the like, know what Vice-Chancellor Malins, an able English judge, thought was the law. He, in the case of McKewan v. Sanderson[9], at page 234, spoke thus:\u2014\nI give no opinion as to whether this is a proper case for law or equity, and I give no opinion as to the law or the equity. That will have to be considered hereafter; but the ground of this plea is that there was an improper arrangement between the debtor and his creditor to the detriment of the other creditors, and the doctrine of this court is appealed to which was laid down so repeatedly by Lord Eldon, and finally in the case always referred to, of Jackman v. Mitchell[10]. It is a doctrine founded on the soundest principles, namely, that whenever there are proceedings in bankruptcy or insolvency, or any arrangement between a debtor and his creditors generally, and one of the creditors stipulates either for the payment of a greater dividend to him than is paid to the other creditors, or for any collateral advantage whatever, even such as giving the right to purchase a horse, or any advantage whatever not common to the creditors, any payment made will be ordered to be repaid, any security given will be ordered to be given up, and this court will treat the whole thing as fraudulent against the other creditors; and anything done in favour of the creditor who obtains this advantage will be set aside by this court. That principle has been frequently acted upon. I refer to Jackman v. Mitchell10, because it has been cited, but Geere v. Mare[11], is a case on the point at law; and finally, it was very much considered by Vice-Chancellor Stuart in Mare v. Sandford[12], which, as well as some other cases, arose under the same bankruptcy as Geere v. Mare11.\nThe case is adopted, and cited with many others, by Sir Frederick Pollock at page 238 of his work on contracts, when dealing therein with the subject of fraudulent or illegal contracts of this character.\n\"Against public policy\" is, I think, in this connection but another name for fraud. I agree with the law as laid down in what I quote from Malins V.-C. and hold the promissory notes sued upon herein are of the kind he describes and subject to the legal consequences he suggests.\nThey furnish no security upon, which any one can recover or should as part of public policy be permitted to recover. I cannot distinguish in principle any difference between a deed of composition and anything else of the like nature, jointly agreed upon by creditors, or a number of them, in case of a common debtor.\nThe Quebec law I imagine is the same despite the nice distinction said to have been made in France. I also think as the debtor gave the notes in Toronto and all else was done there except possibly the mere signing by respondent, and as it is the indorsement of a promissory note delivered there that is in question, the Ontario law is what should govern, if there is any difference.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014The controversy which has led to this appeal arose out of an agreement, the terms of which are embodied in a memorandum dated the 4th April, 1913, between one Grossman and certain creditors of Grossman who included the appellants.\nGrossman being in difficulties arranged with these creditors for an extension of time; there were other creditors whose claims were not included in the arrangement, these claims not being considered of sufficient importance to embarrass Grossman after obtaining the extension arranged for. The memorandum embodying the arrangement was executed on its date by all the parties except the appellants and one Ward. The absence of Ward's signature appears to have been accidental, since he carried out the arrangement in accordance with the understanding that he was a party to it. The appellants executed the document in the following month; and the execution of it by them was procured through an arrangement between themselves and Grossman, that Grossman was to obtain the guarantee of his brother-in-law, the respondent Rittenberg, that the appellants' claim would be paid. The guarantee was given in the form of an indorsement of each of the promissory notes sued upon; and was given and accepted on the understanding that the existence of the guarantee was not to be disclosed\u2014as in point of fact it was not\u2014to the creditors who were parties to the extension agreement.\nThe respondent's defence is that the agreement to give this guarantee behind the backs of the other creditors participating in the extension arrangement being a fraud on these creditors\u2014the fraud vitiates the agreement and deprives of all legal effect the indorsements given in execution of it.\nThe memorandum signed by the creditors contains a recital to the effect that the creditors named as parties have executed it; and there can be no doubt that this recital embodies an essential term of the extension agreement which was made on the understanding that the claims of all the creditors named in the instrument as drawn were to be affected by the extension. It is true that the appellants are not mentioned eo nomine as parties but their agent is named and it was no doubt the appellants' claim that the parties had in view. It is clearly made out in point of fact, that Grossman, the appellants and the respondent all understood that the appellants' claim was to be brought within the arrangement for giving time and that involved, as it has been many times held, the assumption that they were to stand on an equal footing with all the other parties to the extension. Any advantage, therefore, obtained by them as the price of their participation, which was not made known to the other parties, must be an advantage which they could not retain without departing from the line of conduct marked out in such circumstances by the dictates of good faith. Yet this, in view of the agreement between the respondent and Grossman and the appellants, must be held to have been precisely what it was intended the appellants should do. In Ex parte Milner[13], it was decided by the Court of Appeal that the essence of a composition arrangement between a debtor and his creditors is equality among the creditors; and that any departure from the course pointed out by this principle by which one creditor seeks to obtain an unconscionable advantage over the others must fail of its object because any arrangement having that as its object is unenforceable as being a fraud upon the other parties to the composition.\nIt was not suggested that the principle is any less a principle of law in the Province of Quebec than in places where the common law obtains. But it was argued by Mr. Lafleur that the principle has no application in the case of a mere, agreement for extension. That is a view I cannot accept, for the core of the matter is that the inculpated transaction is a fraud upon persons to whom in the circumstances the creditor owes a duty of disclosing any such transaction. I cannot concede, that the principle of equality or that this duty of disclosure is any less imperative where the creditors give merely an extension of time, than where they give up a proportionate part of their claims; and such being the case the sterility which affects a bargain for a secret advantage where a composition's in question is equally the consequence of a secret bargain having reference to an arrangement for giving time only.\nAn argument which at first gave me some concern arising out of the last paragraph of the memorandum requires notice. The paragraph is in the following words :\u2014 The First Party agrees that he will not during the currency of this extension and until these liabilities are paid off give any preference or security on any of his assets no matter where situate without the consent of the Second Parties.\nIt was contended by Mr. Lafleur that the preposition \"on\" connects \"preference\" as well as \"security\" with the succeeding phrase \"any of his assets\" and that consequently the respondent's guarantee is not within the contemplation of this clause. I do not find it necessary to express any opinion upon the point of construction. Assuming Mr. Lafleur's reading to be the right reading, I think, after reflection, that the respondents' rights are not in any way prejudiced by the presence of this clause. The clause, it should be noted, is not primarily directed to securing the observance of good faith among the persons executing the memorandum; it imposes primarily a duty upon the debtor who is a party to the agreement and the result of it is to disable him from giving any preference or security to any of his creditors including, of course, those who were parties to the extension agreement, but including also those who were not parties to it. The clause itself would no doubt, apart from any general principle of law, involve the persons executing the memorandum in an obligation not to concur with the debtor in any conduct which would be in violation of the letter or spirit of it. But the clause is not aptly framed to displace, and the duties and rights expressly created by, or arising by implication out of the clause, do not necessarily displace, the reciprocal obligations of good faith which the law imposes ab extra upon the creditors who are parties to the transaction inter se; and it would not be right to infer an intention to displace them for the reason already mentioned, namely, that primarily the clause is framed alio intuito, namely, to impose an obligation on the debtor; and extends to the claims of all creditors whether parties to the arrangement or not.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014By executing the agreement made between the debtor Grossman and a number of his principal creditors the appellants represented to the other creditors who were parties to it that they were giving to the debtor an extension upon the terms contained in that agreement, to which the other creditors had bound themselves, and without obtaining any preference or advantage over them. The agreement contained a recital that the creditors named in it had agreed to grant the debtor an extension only on the condition that all of them should join therein. In that agreement the appellants were first represented by their agent Eisen. Eventually they executed it in their own name. But whereas the other parties who executed the agreement accepted from the debtor, without other security, his notes at three, six, nine and twelve months the appellants insisted on their claim being liquidated in monthly instalments and upon payment thereof being secured by the indorsement of the debtor's brother-in-law. When making this arrangement they impressed upon the debtor the necessity of keeping it from the knowledge of the other creditors.\nI can see no distinction in principle between an agreement for extension given by his creditors to a debtor and an agreement whereby they forego proportionate parts of their claims. Equality as between themselves and a strict adherence to the terms of the common arrangement with the debtor is an essential element in both cases. On grounds of public policy a secret bargain violating that equality is unlawful and additional security obtained under it is unenforceable: Clark v. Ritchie[14]; McKewan v. Sanderson[15]. No authority has been cited which upholds a security obtained in distinct violation of the express terms of an agreement made with other creditors such as we have before us. The present case is clearly distinguishable from Langley v. Van Allen[16], relied on by the appellant. That was a case of seeking to recover for the estate money given by the debtor to a creditor who had insisted on being paid off sooner than the other creditors. This is a case of resisting the enforcement of a security unlawfully taken.\nThis action was brought in Montreal, no doubt because the defendant resides there. But the notes sued upon were made at Toronto and are payable there. The extension agreement was also made at Toronto where the debtor resided and carried on business. It would therefore seem that the legality of the transaction whereby Rittenberg became an indorser must be tested according to the law of that province, which was duly proved at the trial. It may be observed, however, that a French decision cited by the appellants, reported in D. 69.1.92 and noted in Fuzier-Herman, Rep. Vo. \"Atermoiement\" No. 106, is there significantly referred to as having been \"command\u00e9e par l'esp\u00e8ce,\" and not in conflict with the rule of equality.\nThe appellant's case, in my opinion, is wholly devoid of merit. The appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nBrodeur J.\u2014Par un acte d'atermo\u00eement dat\u00e9 du 14 avril 1913 entre le d\u00e9biteur Grossman et certains de ses cr\u00e9anciers parmi lesquels se trouvaient les appelants il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 convenu qu'une extension de temps serait accord\u00e9e au d\u00e9biteur pour payer ses diff\u00e9rents cr\u00e9anciers; et l'une des clauses de ce contrat comportait que le d\u00e9biteur ne pourrait pas pendant le cours de cette extension\ngive any preference or security on any of his assets, no matter where situate,\nsans le consentement de ses cr\u00e9anciers.\nLes appelants malgr\u00e9 cette convention formelle, ont obtenu de leur d\u00e9biteur des billets endoss\u00e9s par l'intim\u00e9. La question est de savoir si cet endossement est l\u00e9gal et ne constitue pas une pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence contraire \u00e0 l'ordre public.\nLes appelants pr\u00e9tendent qu'en vertu de la convention le d\u00e9biteur ne pouvait pas donner de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence ou de garantie sur aucun de ses biens mais que le fait pour eux d'avoir obtenu ce consentement ne constituait pas une violation de cette convention.\nCette clause formelle qui se trouve dans l'acte ne pouvait pas permettre aux diff\u00e9rents cr\u00e9anciers d'obtenir de leur d\u00e9biteur des avantages sp\u00e9ciaux. Cette clause, suivant moi, avait pour but d'emp\u00eacher le d\u00e9biteur, pendent l'existence de l'atermoiement, de donner \u00e0 aucun autre cr\u00e9ancier des privil\u00e8ges ou des garanties sur ses biens. Alors on ne voulait pas que le d\u00e9biteur qui aurait contract\u00e9 de nouvelles dettes put donner \u00e0 ses nouveaux cr\u00e9anciers des faveurs particuli\u00e8res sur les biens qui \u00e9taient le gage de ses cr\u00e9anciers ant\u00e9rieurs.\nMais cette disposition particuli\u00e8re du contrat pouvait-elle emp\u00eacher les cr\u00e9anciers qui la signaient d'obtenir \u00e0 leur tour de leur d\u00e9biteur des avantages particuliers?\nJe dis que non. La loi exige que tous les cr\u00e9anciers dans les concordats ou dans les atermo\u00eements soient tous mis sur le m\u00eame pied. Elle proscrit tout avantage consenti \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'un seul cr\u00e9ancier. Fuzier-Herman, verbo \"Atermoiement\" No. 96. Il est d'ordre public, il est dans l'inter\u00eat de la bonne foi des contrats, que ces actes soient faits sans qu'aucun cr\u00e9ancier soit plus avantag\u00e9 que l'autre.

It is sufficient that, within such time, he signifies to the vendee his intention to redeem. Duff and Anglin JJ. dissented.\nJudgment appealed from (Q.R. 25 K.B. 464), affirmed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of King's Bench, Appeal Side, for the Province of Quebec[1], affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nBy the respondent's action it was contended that the right to redeem the farm became extinguished on the 20th October, 1914, owing to failure to bring suit to enforce the right of redemption within the term stipulated in the deed of sale.\nThe Superior Court held that the notification, within the stipulated term, by the respondent of his intention to redeem, prevented his right of redemption from lapsing, even after the expiration of the time. This judgment was affirmed by the Court of King's Bench.\nOn the 20th October, 1904, one On\u00e9sime Laflamme sold to the appellant a farm with the buildings thereon, for $600.00 cash, the seller reserving his right to redeem it within ten years, viz.: until the 20th October, 1914, upon repayment of the above sum to the purchaser. The reserve clause reads thus:\u2014\n\"The said vendor doth hereby reserve in his favour the right to redeem the property above described and sold, any time within ten years from this day, by reimbursing to the said purchaser the said sum of six hundred dollars, together with interest at five per centum per annum, payable yearly up to the full reimbursement of the said sum of six hundred dollars.\"\nThe respondent alleged that on 7th November, 1907, On\u00e9sime Laflamme conveyed to him his right of redemption of the said farm about which nothing was done until the 19th October, 1914, when the respondent caused to be served on the appellant a protest mentioning the original deed by On\u00e9sime Laflamme to him and adding that he had acquired from On\u00e9sime Laflamme his right to redeem the farm and calling upon the appellant to accept and receive the sum of $630.00 \"en bonne esp\u00e8ce et valeur ayant cours en cette province,\" under pain of all damages and costs.\nThe appellant having failed to comply with this request, the respondent, on the 8th January, 1915, brought action against him for the enforcement of the right.\nMignault K.C. and P. H. Cot\u00e9 K.C. for the appellant. Effect must be given to the provisions of art. 1550 C.C. according to the plain meaning of the language used without regard to the prior state of the law or opinions of commentators, Vagliano v. Bank of England[2], at pages 144-5; Herse v. Dufaux[3]; Abbott v. Fraser[4]. The action should be returned into court before expiration of the delay and accompanied by offres r\u00e9elles. Walker v.

H. Cot\u00e9 K.C. for the appellant.\nGirouard K.C. and M\u00e9thot K.C. for the respondent\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This is an action brought by the plaintiff, respondent, as assignee of the rights of his brother, Olivier Laflamme, to enforce an agreement entered into between the latter and the defendant, appellant, on the 20th October, 1904.\nBy that agreement Olivier Laflamme sold to the appellant a lot of land for the price of $600 subject to a stipulation that the vendor reserved to himself the right to take back the property upon restoring the price of it with interest. The stipulation is expressed in these words:\u2014\nThe said vendor doth hereby reserve in his favour the right to redeem the property above described and sold, any time within ten years from this day, by reimbursing to the said purchaser the said sum of six hundred dollars, together with interest at five per centum per annum, payable yearly up to the full reimbursement of the said sum of six hundred dollars.\nOn the 30th November, 1907, the plaintiff bought for the sum of $800 his brother's right to redeem the land, and he has ever since been in possession, paying taxes, interest, insurance and fulfilling all the other obligations of an owner.\nOn the 18th October, 1914, the plaintiff deposited the amount due under the deed of sale ($600), with interest, in the bank to the credit of the defendant and notified him that the money was there at his disposal. On the next day, 19th October, 1914, within the stipulated term a regular tender of the purchase price was made in notarial form. The defendant did not categorically refuse to accept the redemption money but suggested that the offer required further consideration; the words used were, according to the notarial deed: \"Je refuse pr\u00e9sentement\" It would appear as if the intention was to throw the plaintiff off his guard. Not having heard further from the defendant, this suit was brought in January, 1915.\nThe plea to the action is in substance (a) that Ol. Laflamme failed to fulfil the conditions subject to which the right of redemption might be exercised; (b) that the tender was irregular and the plaintiff did not represent Ol. Laflamme; (c) that the tender did not include the amounts paid by the defendant for insurance, taxes, etc.\nIssue was joined on these pleadings. No evidence was given of any failure to comply with the conditions of the deed; the plaintiff himself was the only witness examined; and the case was disposed of by the trial judge in the plaintiff's favour on the written documents.\nThis would seem to be a very simple case on the pleadings and exhibits and the trial judge decided it on the assumption that the contract, the subject-matter of the action, was an ordinary enforceable agreement. The obligation of the defendant purchaser under that contract was to perform his promise according to its term which was to retrocede the property to his vendor upon payment by the latter of the purchase price within ten years from the date of the sale. Within that period the plaintiff, cessionnaire of the vendor's rights, offered, in compliance with this undertaking, to pay the purchase price, which the defendant refused to accept. There is no doubt as to those facts. The plaintiff therefore did all that he was bound to do when he tendered payment of the amount due within the stipulated term. But it is said the right of the plaintiff to repurchase must be determined not by the letter of his agreement but by the provisions of article 1550 C.C. which means that the obligation of the vendor is not that set out in the words of his agreement, to reimburse the purchaser the sum of six hundred dollars any time within ten years from the date of the sale, but to bring a suit for the enforcement of his right of redemption within that period. As was said in a very recent case in the Court of Appeal at Renne, France,\nCette r\u00e8gie (c'est-\u00e0-dire la r\u00e8gie de 1'article 1662 C.N.-1550 C.C.) n'est pas d'ordre public et s'il est stipul\u00e9 que dans le d\u00e9lai il faudra payer le prix r\u00e9el et les accessoires, cette clause doit \u00eatre observ\u00e9e,\nGaz. Trib. 1914, ler sem. 2, 254. The clear obligation of the vendor was to reimburse the purchase price with interest at any time within ten years from the date of the sale. Is such a stipulation contrary to public policy, and if not, on what principle can it be said that the obligation created is not that clearly expressed in the agreement, but an entirely different and far more onerous one? When the defendant refused to accept the purchase price as tendered he was guilty of a breach of his obligation. And the plaintiff's right to a retrocession of the property only arose thereafter. It was the plaintiff's right under the agreement to redeem at any time within ten years. He had therefore until the last minute of the stipulated term to fulfil his obligation under his agreement which had the force of law over those who were parties to it; modus et conventio vincunt legem. Frank v. Frank[7]; Barrett v. Duke of Bedford[8]; Brown Legal Maxims 522. Toullier states the rule in these terms :\u2014\nPour se prononcer sur de telles questions, le juge devra consulter d'abord les termes du contrat et suivre la loi que se sont faite les parties.\nDe la vente, vol. 2, No. 722.\nI can see no reason why we should be concerned with the very learned discussion which we had as to the meaning of article 1550 C.C. But to avoid possibility of doubt that the views of the majority here are entirely in accord with what the Chief Justice below clearly establishes to be the settled jurisprudence of the Province of Quebec, I will deal with the difficulty which is said to arise out of the fact that the action to enforce the plaintiff's right under the agreement was not brought within the ten years. Article 1550 C.C. is relied upon to support the contention that as a result he has lost his rights under the deed of sale and the defendant remains absolute owner of the property.\nThat article in the French text reads as follows:\u2014\n1550. Faute par le vendeur d'avoir exerc\u00e9 son action de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 dans le temps prescrit, l'acheteur demeure propri\u00e9taire irr\u00e9vocable de la chose vendue (C.N. 1662).\nIt reproduces ipsissimis verbis article 1662 of the Code Napol\u00e9on. At the time this article 1662 C.N. was incorporated in the Quebec Code to amend the then existing law, the words \"son action,\" i.e., \"action de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9\" had been by the French courts and the most eminent text-writers construed to mean that the vendor may use the right of redemption, and do not imply that an action for redemption is necessary (Laurent, vol. 24, para. 397). This was decided by the Cour de Cassation as far back as 25th April, 1812. All the cases and references to the text-writers will be found collected in Fuzier-Herman, Code Civil Annot\u00e9, under article 1662 C.N. and Revue Trimestrielle de Droit Civil, 1915, at page 181.\nPlaniol with his usual lucidity explains the effect of 1662 C.N. in two paragraphs which are worth quoting (vol. 2, 1583) :\u2014\nLa d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance qui frappe le vendeur \u00e0 1'expiration du d\u00e9lai donne un tr\u00e8s grand int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 la question de savoir ce que le vendeur doit faire dans le d\u00e9lai qui lui est accord\u00e9 pour \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme ayant exerc\u00e9 son droit. Des difficult\u00e9s nombreuses s'\u00e9l\u00e8vent sur cette question, parce que le plus souvent le vendeur attend au dernier moment, et l'acheteur pr\u00e9tend qu'il s'y est pris trop tard. Que faut-il qu'il fasse pour \u00e9viter la d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance?\nL'article 1662 ne precise rien: \"Faute par le vendeur d'avoir exerc\u00e9 son action de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9. * * *\" Ce n'est pas d'une action qu'il s'agit: le vendeur est tenu de faire un remboursement. Dans la doctrine on admet en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral que le paiement, ou tout au moins des offres r\u00e9elles, sont n\u00e9cessaires pour qu'il soit bien \u00e9tabli que le vendeur \u00e9tait en mesure d'op\u00e9rer le rachat, et que l'acheteur seul l'en a emp\u00eache. Mais la jurisprudence se montre beaucoup plus facile pour les vendeurs \u00e0 r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9. Elle se contente d'une simple manifestation de volont\u00e9 de leur part; le vendeur signifie \u00e0 l'acheteur par acte extra-judiciaire sa volont\u00e9 d'user de son droit de rachat. Cela suffit, dit la Cour de Cassation, parce qu'aucune disposition de la loi ne prescrit au vendeur de faire dans le d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9 soit un paiement soit des offres.\nIn their Report to the Legislature the Codifiers of the Quebec Code give in article 64 the time and mode of exercising the right of redemption according to the existing law and then say:\u2014\nL'article 64 \u00e9nonce le temps et la mani\u00e8re d'exercer cette facult\u00e9 de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 suivant la loi actuelle. Les commissaires croient que le changement fait par le Code Napol\u00e9on dans les r\u00e8gies sur ce sujet les simplifie consid\u00e9rablement et les rend plus convenables dans leur application et leur effet. Ils out en cons\u00e9quence adopt\u00e9 quatre articles du Code qu'ils soumettent comme amendement \u00e0 la loi actuelle. Ils sont marqu\u00e9s 64a, 64b, 64c, 64d. Ils Limitent l'exercice du droit \u00e0 dix ans et astreignent strictement les parties \u00e0 leurs conventions sans permettre aux tribunaux de les \u00e9tendre, et sans exiger l'intervention d'un jugement pour d\u00e9clarer le droit \u00e9teint.\nIt is impossible to more clearly express the intention to adopt the rule of the French Code with respect to the mode and time of exercising the right of redemption. Article 64c is now article 1550 C.C. It is of some importance to note that among the French Commentators referred to by the Codifiers are Dalloz, Vente, ch. 1, section 4; Troplong, Vente, No. 716; 5 Boileux, art. 1662; 16 Duranton, No. 401; all of whom agree in saying that it is not necessary to bring an action within the delay. The reference to Boileux is specially interesting because he discusses the very question we are now called upon to decide. Boileux says:\u2014\nMais au moyen de quels actes le r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9s doit-il avoir lieu? Une action en justice est-elle n\u00e9cessaire? Il suffit au vendeur de manifester par acte extra-judiciaire, dans le d\u00e9lai prescrit, l'intention d'user du pacte de rachat avec soumission de rembourser tout ce qui peut \u00eatre l\u00e9galement d\u00fb. La loi voit avec faveur l'exercice du r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9. Ainsi les mots: faute d'avoir exerc\u00e9 son-action en r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 sont synonimes de deux ci: faute d'avoir us\u00e9 du pacte de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9.\nWith that quotation before them (vide Biblioth\u00e8que du Code Civil, vol. 12, page 383), the Codifiers adopt the language of the French Code. The fair inference, therefore, is that if the expression \"son action\" was ambiguous when first used in the Code Napol\u00e9on, that ambiguity was removed and the term had acquired a fixed definite meaning in the French law when it was incorporated in the Quebec Code in. 1866. Since the promulgation of that Code, as pointed out by the Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal, the courts of Quebec have invariably construed article 1550 in the same way as article 1662 C.N. had been and still is construed. Walker v. Sheppard[9], is referred to as an exception, but here are the words of the \"consid\u00e9rant\" in that case:\u2014\nD'ailleurs la pr\u00e9sente action a \u00e9t\u00e9 intent\u00e9e trop tard, vu qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 rapport\u00e9e post\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 1'expiration du d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9 pour l'exercice du r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 et sans offres r\u00e9elles au d\u00e9fendeur du prix et loyaux co\u00f9ts. Throughout the case seems to turn on the failure to reimburse the price.\nIf the courts below had not followed the \"doctrine\" and \"jurisprudence\" to which the Codifiers\" refer they would have set at defiance, in prinicple at least, the salutary advice given by the Privy Council to the Australian Court in Trimble v. Hill[10]. See also Casgrain v. Atlantic and North-West Railway Co.[11], at p. 300; Taschereau J. in Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Robinson[12], at page 316.\nIf the question was at large one would feel bound by the decisions in the French courts because, as Laurent says:\n\"Il est de principe qu'il faut interpr\u00e9ter le code par la tradition \u00e0 laquelle il se rattache quand il la consacre.\"\n(Laurent, vol. 2, 608). Vide also Kieffer v. Le S\u00e9minaire de Qu\u00e9bec[13], at page 96. Dealing with the question at issue in that case, their Lordships say:\u2014\nThe answer to this question must depend on the requirements of the French law, upon which the Quebec Code is founded.\nGirouard J. citing a number of recent French authorities says in Connolly v. Consumers Cordage Co.[14], at page 310:\u2014\nI feel that I cannot disregard the opinions of those great jurists who are generally considered in Quebec as the best exponents of our Code. Nor can I ignore the numerous decisions of the Cour de Cassation and other French tribunals.\nVide also Renaud v. Lamothe[15], at page 366; Parent v. Daigle[16], at page 175.\nIt was argued by Mr. Mignault to explain the course of decisions in France and the opinions of the commentators that in article 1662 C.N. the word \"action\" is used interchangeably with the word \"facult\u00e9\" or \"droit,\" whereas in the Quebec Code the word \"facult\u00e9\" is used in contradistinction to the word \"action.\" I have carefully examined the articles of the Quebec Code and compared them with the corresponding articles of the Code Napol\u00e9on but without being able to reach any such conclusion. On the contrary, I find, as the Codifiers say in their report, that the articles to which Mr. Mignault refers are taken from the French Code with slight verbal changes, but the words \"action\" and \"facult\u00e9\" are used in the same connection in both Codes. In article 1650 C.C. it is said:\u2014\nFaute par le vendeur d'avoir exerc\u00e9 son action de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 * * *\nand then in article 1552 the words used are:\u2014\nLe vendeur peut exercer cette facult\u00e9 de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 * * *,\nreferring clearly to the \"action de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9\" in article 1550. Again article 1553 C.C. says:\u2014\nL'acheteur d'une chose sujette \u00e0 la facult\u00e9 de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 * * *\nArticle 1555:\u2014\nL'acheteur d'un heritage sujet au droit de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 * * *,\nand in article 1556 \"facult\u00e9 de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9\" is used in the same sense as \"droit de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9\" in article 1557. The conclusion that the words \"droit\" and \"facult\u00e9\" are used interchangeably in the whole group of articles concerned seems irresistible.\nThe real difficulty in this case as it was argued here arises out of the English translation of article 1550 C.C. I use the term English translation advisedly. It is said that the word \"action\" in the French text is ambiguous and that the language of the English version which removed the ambiguity should be adopted. I understand this to mean necessarily that the English version of article 1550 is not to be treated as a mistranslation, which it is, of the French text, but as an aid to interpret that text. For a correct translation of art. 1662 C.N. vide French Code Annotated by Blackwood Wright. Vide also: Civil Code of Louisiana, art. 2548.\nIt may be that for those who choose to consider article 1550 C.C. in the French text without reference either to the \"doctrine\" or \"jurisprudence\" which prevailed in France when that article was adopted from the Code Napol\u00e9on some ambiguity arises out of the use of the word \"action,\" but the Codifiers had that so called ambiguity present to their minds, as appears by the quotation from Boileux, and the simple way to remove the ambiguity, if it existed, was to alter the language of the French text and not to adopt the extraordinary method of removing the ambiguity in the French text by making the English version serve as a key to the true sense of that text. That the Codifiers had no such intention is made clear by their report. When speaking of articles 65-73 of the report, which are articles 1552-1560 of the Civil Code, after saying they adopt 64a, 64b, 64c, 64d, from the Code Napol\u00e9on, they add:\u2014\nQuelques changements de mots ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits dans les autres articles (65-73) pour rendre 1'exposition des r\u00e8gies plus compl\u00e8te et \u00e9viter les ambiguit\u00e9s signal\u00e9es par les commentateurs.\nWhy, if there was an ambiguity in their minds as to the meaning of article 64c did they not adopt the same method and make the necessary verbal changes? Speaking with proper deference I would venture to add that it is not by any means so clear, as Mr. Justice Cross finds, that under the provisions of the English version the suit must be brought within the stipulated term. Grammatically the words \"within the stipulated term\" may perfectly be read as qualifying the words \"his right to redemption\" which immediately precede them; there is no stop between them such as we should expect to find if \"within the stipulated term\" had reference to the bringing of the suit; indeed if this was the meaning, the proper reading would be:\u2014\nIf the seller fail within the stipulated term to bring a suit for the enforcement of his right of redemption.\nMoreover, the theory that is now suggested, while it has the charm of novelty, ignores completely the rule laid down by the Code itself in articles 2615 and 12 C.C. for the solution of the very difficulty that has arisen here. Article 2615 provides that if there be a difference between the English and the French texts that version shall prevail which is most consistent with the provisions of the existing laws on which the article is founded and if there be any such difference in an article changing the existing laws, as in this case, that version shall prevail which is more consistent with the intention of the article. Which version is more consistent with the intention of the article if we take into consideration the language of the Codifiers who say that their intention was to adopt the article of the Code Napol\u00e9on, referring at the same time to the Commentators who interpret and fix the meaning of the language used: Freedman v. Caldwell[17]; Naud v. Marcotte[18]; Meloche v. Simpson[19], at page 385 et seq.; Gosselin v. The King[20], at p. 268; Wardle v. Bethune[21], at page 52; Symes v. Cuvillier[22], at page 158? In Exchange Bank v. The Queen[23], at page 167, their Lordships say, speaking of article 1994 C.C:\u2014\nIf there be any difference between the French and English versions, their Lordships think that in a matter which is evidently one of French law, the French version using a French technical term should be the leading one.\nSee also Harrington v. Corse[24], at pages 108-9.\nThis case affords an apt illustration of the injustice that naturally follows from the strained interpretation which the appellant seeks to put on article 1550 C.C. The parties live at a considerable distance from the chef-lieu of the judicial district. To bring an action within the ten years the offer to reimburse must be made a sufficient time before the expiration of the redemption period, in this case at least four days, to allow the vendor in case of refusal to proceed to the court, consult a lawyer, take out a writ and have it served. Why should the vendor lose the benefit of this period when his contract gave him the full ten years within which to exercise his right to redeem?\nOn the other points raised I agree with the majority below.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014I agree that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J. (dissenting).\u2014The fate of this appeal depends, in my view of it, upon the decision of a single point which is a dry point of law and can be stated and discussed without reference to the facts of the particular case before us. The question relates to the construction and effect of article 1550 C.C. which is expressed in the following words:\u2014 1550. Faute par le vendeur d'avoir exerc\u00e9 son action de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 dans le terme present, l'acheteur demeure propri\u00e9taire irrevocable de la chose vendue.\n1550. If the seller fail to bring a suit for the enforcement of his right of redemption within the stipulated term, the buyer remains absolute owner of the thing sold.\nAnd the point to be determined is this\u2014does this article require as a condition of the effective exercise of the vendor's \"right of redemption\" the commencement of appropriate judicial proceedings for the vindication of that right within the \"redemption\" term stipulated by the contract of sale?\nReading the two versions together without reference to any context, the construction and effect of them seem not to be open to controversy, although the words in the French version\nd'avoir exerc\u00e9 son action de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9,\nare not so precise as to be altogether incapable of more than one necessarily exclusive meaning. This cannot be affirmed of the words of the English version\nIf the seller fail to bring a suit for the enforcement of his right of redemption, etc.,\nwords both apt and precise and their one necessary meaning being that which they convey on the first view, namely, that the taking of legal proceedings by the seller in a court of justice to vindicate his droit de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 within the stipulated time is a condition of the enforcement of that right in the sense that default in doing so makes the title of the purchaser absolute. This, moreover, though not the only possible reading is the primary and natural reading of the French version; and the slight ambiguity presented by the terms of that version, being removed by the precise and apt words in which the condition is defined by the English version all possibly imputable lack of exactitude in the words \u2014 considered in themselves apart from the context and history of the article\u2014disappears.\nIs there in the cognate articles, the articles dealing with the same subject\u2014vente \u00e0 r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9\u2014anything which supplies a qualifying context? The answer must be in the negative. Arts. 1545 to 1560 inclusive, speak of la facult\u00e9 de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9, le droit de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9, and the \"right of redemption\" but there are no words in any of these articles which could properly be read as controlling the effect of the words of art. 1550.\nIs there anything in this construction of art. 1550 so repugnant to the nature of the droit de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 or to the provisions of the cognate articles which requires us to search for some construction more in consonance with general legal principle or with these correlative provisions of the code? According to the construction indicated, the article may, no doubt, have this effect\u2014the droit de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 must be exercised in such fashion as to enable the vendor to bring his suit within the agreed term; and the consequence (it may be) follows that the vendor must, in order to enable him to do this effectively, at least, manifest his intention to exercise his right at a date earlier by an appreciable time than that at which he would otherwise have been required to do so; in other words, it may be that the effect of art. 1550, read according to the natural construction of the language employed, is necessarily to curtail in some degree the stipulated term and possibly, in rare cases, to curtail it substantially. I do not say that under that construction this is in truth the effect of the article. The just view may be that by force of these articles themselves appropriate legal proceedings can validly be taken simultaneously with the tender, offer or expression of consent necessary to constitute an effective exercise of the facult\u00e9 de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9. Assuming, however, the former to be the consequence of the construction indicated; that, it seems to me, presents no sound reason for refusing to leave to its proper operation the unequivocal language of art. 1550.\nIs there anything in the judicial history of that article in the Province of Quebec to create doubts as to its proper construction? Here again the answer must be in the negative. Our attention has been called to three decisions in which the point has been touched upon: Walker v. Shepherd[25]; Trudel v. Bouchard[26]; Dorion v. St. Germain[27]. In the first of these an opinion was expressed favourable to the view now advanced by the appellant. In Trudel v. Bouchard26, nothing is said explicitly by Mr. Justice Jett\u00e9 upon the point before us, but from the circumstances of the case and the nature of the judgment the proper inference appears to be that his opinion would not have been unfavourable to the contention of the present appellant. The last of the above mentioned cases does not, so far as one can see, deal with or involve the point although there is a reference to it in the reporter's head-note. There are some observations in the argument of the distinguished counsel who appeared for the appellant unsuccessfully to which one of course cannot attribute the weight attaching to judicial dicta.\nThere being neither ambiguity in the article itself when read as a whole, nor qualifying context nor anything in the judicial application of the article in the Province of Quebec to create a difficulty, the court of appeal has found itself constrained to reject or disregard the English version and to give to the French version which is a literal transcription of art. 1662 C.N. the construction and effect which the last mentioned article has unanimously received in France in both la doctrine and la jurisprudence.\nI will state the twofold reason which compels me to hold this course to be inadmissible. First: In France they have proceeded upon the ground that the expression\nexer\u00e7er l'action en r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9\nis capable of more than one meaning.\nL'expression exer\u00e7er l'action en r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 peut avoir un autre sens, celui d'agir c'est-\u00e0-dire de faire ce que le vendeur doit faire pour exer\u00e7er son droit,\nsays Laurent (Vol. 24 Principes de Droit Civil Fran\u00e7ais, p. 287). And although admittedly it is more natural to read the words \"l'action en r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9\" quoted from article 1662 as a processual phrase in the sense according to which they are equivalent to \"action en justice,\" it has been held nevertheless than the other less natural but admissible reading indicated by Laurent is more in consonance with the general effect of the provisions of the Code Napol\u00e9on dealing with vente \u00e0 r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 (4 Aubry & Rau, 4th ed., p. 409, art. 357, note).\nThe courts of Quebec, it is evident, are called upon to decide a very different question from that which confronted the tribunals and the authors in France under art. 1662. In order to parallel in the question presented by art. 1662 the postulates of the question presented here it would be necessary to interpolate in art. 1662 words making that article read \"d'avoir exer\u00e7\u00e9 son action en justice.\"\nSecondly: It is not within the authority of the courts in construing art. 1550 to reject or disregard the English version. The Code as an authoritative exposition of the civil law of the Province of Quebec is founded upon statute. There was first an Act of the Province of Canada (20 Vict. ch. 43) authorizing the appointment of commissioners and directing that they should embody in the code to be framed by them, to be called the Civil Code of Lower Canada, such provisions as they should hold to be then actually in force giving the authorities on which their views should be based, but stating separately any proposed amendments. Then (the Commissioners having in due course framed their report and laid it before Parliament), there was another Act (29 Vict. ch. 41) declaring a certain roll attested in the manner described in the Act to be the original of the Civil Code reported by the Commissioners as containing the existing law without amendments; directing the Commissioners to incorporate in this roll certain amendments specified in a schedule; and eliminating and altering the provisions of the Code only so far as should be necessary to give effect to these amendments; and providing that the Code so altered should, on proclamation by the Governor, have the force of law.\nThe Code thus produced must be read, of course, in view of the fact that it is what it is, namely, a statement made under legislative authority of a system of civil law, a statement speaking broadly, explicit as to specific rules but in some measure as to underlying principles taking effect by implication and influence; particular rules and principles which may no doubt be misconceived or misapplied if considered in isolation from the general system of which they are elements. But the rule we are now called upon to put into effect, art. 1550, was one of those incorporated at the suggestion of the Commissioners as a new provision in amendment of the existing law, and as an amendment of the existing law it was explicitly adopted by the enactment of the legislature which gave it legal force; and in such cases the Code itself by art. 2615 (which is as follows):\u2014\nIf in any article of this Code founded on the laws existing at the time of its promulgation, there be a difference between the English and the French texts, that version shall prevail which is most consistent with the provisions of the existing laws on which the article is founded; and if there be any such difference in an article changing the existing law, that version shall prevail which is most consistent with the intention of the article, and the ordinary rules of legal interpretation shall apply in determining such intention,\nindicates the rule by which we are to be guided although art. 1550 is not one of those in which when properly construed there is any \"difference between the English and the French texts.\" How, following the ordinary rules of interpretation, is \"the intention\" to be ascertained? Primarily, of course, from the language employed interpreted by light of the requisite technical knowledge; and where\u2014in such cases\u2014that language construed of course in its entirety is quite without ambiguity and there is no qualifying context, there would appear to be only one course for a judicial tribunal to pursue: (Robinson v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[28], at pages 487-8). The \"ordinary rules of interpretation\" would hardly sanction the elimination of one version unequivocal in itself and harmonious with the natural reading of the other version in order to give to the article an operation resulting from a rather strained and less natural reading of the second version with which the rejected text could not by any process of interpretation be reconciled.\nTwo arguments have been addressed to us which deserve to be noticed. First, it is said that since the French version of art. 1550 is a literal transcription of an article of the Code Napol\u00e9on, the French version must be regarded as the original, and the English version as a translation. On the point of fact, I should say that was self-evident. But the English version no less than the French version is expressed in the language of the legislature or in language adopted by the legislature. Secondly, it is said that the Commissioners must be assumed to have known the course of the interpretation in France and that the report of the Commissioners shews their intention to adopt the law laid down in the Code Napol\u00e9on (art. 1662) as construed in France. The report of the Commissioners can be prayed in aid on the ground that it may be supposed to have been present to the mind of the legislature: Eastman Photographic Materials Co, v. Comptroller-General of Patents[29], at pages 575 and 576; and the Commissioners must no doubt be assumed to have been acquainted with the course of la doctrine and la jurisprudence in France. But in the last analysis we come to this: the Commissioners and the legislature, whatever presumptions are to be made with regard to other matters, must be presumed to have known the meaning of the words they used. Assuming then, that they had the general intention to adopt the law of the Code Napol\u00e9on\u2014nevertheless the final and decisive statement of the effect of the concrete provision they did adopt, as they conceived it to be, is to be found in the unambiguous words of the English version. The French version reproduces the Code Napol\u00e9on; but the English version supplies a legislative interpretation which the courts are not at liberty to ignore. In this view the appeal must be allowed and the action dismissed.\nTwo other grounds of appeal of considerable importance are raised by the appellant. It is not necessary to pass any opinion on these and the only observation I make is this. Having regard to the opinion of Pothier given to the world in the 18th century and the opinion of a very eminent authority (Aubry & Rau) published before the adoption of the Quebec Code, as well as to the unbroken uniformity of la jurisprudence in France to the effect that the \"right of redemption\" reserved to the vendor under a contract of vente \u00e0 r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 is jus ad rem only and not jus in re, I think it a very disputable question whether the opposite view, though held by almost all the reputable authors in France, including Laurent, ought to be given effect to.\nAnglin J. (dissenting).\u2014The question presented in this case is whether a vendor subject to right of redemption in order to exercise that right effectually is bound not only to signify to the purchaser his intention to redeem the property, accompanying the signification by a tender of the amount due, but, in the event of refusal by the purchaser to accept, is further bound to bring action to enforce his right of redemption within the period stipulated for its exercise. That the right of redemption absolutely terminates upon the expiry of the stipulated term unless it has been effectually exercised within the term and that it cannot be extended by the court is admittedly the effect of art. 1549. Indeed so strict is the law in this regard that the term runs against all persons including minors and those otherwise incapable in law, reserving to the latter such recourse as they may be entitled to: Art. 1551 C.C.\nIn the present case the stipulated term for redemption was ten years, the maximum term permitted by law: Art. 1548 C.C. Shortly before the expiry of the ten years the vendor notified the purchaser of his intention to redeem and tendered to him the amount to which he was entitled. Payment not having been accepted, he caused a notarial protest to be made before the expiry of the ten years. He did not commence his action to enforce his right of redemption, however, until several months after the expiry of the stipulated term.\nArt. 1550 of the Civil Code, in the French and English versions, reads as follows:\u2014\n1550. Faute par le vendeur d'avoir exerc\u00e9 son action de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9, dans le terme present, l'acheteur demeure propri\u00e9taire irr\u00e9vocable de la chose vendue.\n1550. If the seller fail to bring a suit for the enforcement of his right of redemption within the stipulated term, the buyer remains absolute owner of the thing sold.\nIn the Court of Appeal it was pointed out that this article in the French version is an exact reproduction of art. 1662 of the Code Napol\u00e9on. The French authorities have held that the word action in the Napol\u00e9onic article should be read as meaning facult\u00e9 or droit, and that a notification within the term of intention to redeem accompanied by tender is a valid and effectual exercise of the right which may be enforced by action brought after the expiry of the term. No doubt the jurisprudence of the Province of Quebec, with the exception possibly of the case of Walker v. Sheppard[30], supports the same view of art. 1550 of the Civil Code, and my lord the Chief Justice and my brother Brodeur also adopt it. It is therefore with the utmost diffidence that I venture to express the contrary opinion.\nAs Mr. Mignault pointed out, however, in his able argument, the construction placed by the French authorities on art. 1662 of the Code Napol\u00e9on depends largely upon the use of the term action interchangeably with the words facult\u00e9 or droit in arts. 1664, 1668 and 1669 C.N. (See Beaudry-Lacantinerie, No. 615, 24 Laurent, No. 397) which form the context of art. 1662. On the other hand in the corresponding provisions of the Quebec Civil Code, arts. 1552, 1556 and 1557, which form the context of art. 1550, we find the words facult\u00e9 and droit apparently used in contradistinction to the word action used in art. 1550. Thus for the word action used in art. 1664 of the Code Napol\u00e9on the Quebec Code in art. 1552 substitutes the word facult\u00e9. Likewise for the word action in art. 1668 of the Code Napol\u00e9on we find in art. 1556 of the Quebec Civil Code the word facult\u00e9. In art. 1669 of the C.N. the word facult\u00e9 is used obviously in the same sense in which the word action had been used in art. 1689, whereas the Quebec Civil Code in art. 1557 employs the word droit as the equivalent of the word facult\u00e9 used in art. 1556. The Quebec Code in arts. 1559 and 1560 likewise replaces the phrase l'action en r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 of articles 1671 and 1672 of the Code Napol\u00e9on by the phrase facult\u00e9 de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9. Articles 1546 and 1547, the provisions of the Quebec Code corresponding to article 1673 C.N. (which Laurent, vol. 24, No. 397, relies on as conclusive of the interpretation of the phrase exercer l'action de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 in the Code Napol\u00e9on, because it immediately follows articles 1671-2 and the phrase \"use du pacte de rachat\" is found in it used, as he says, in the same sense as \"exercer l'action en r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9\" in those articles) are placed at the opening of the section and have there no such significance. Indeed in the whole section of the Quebec Civil Code intituled \"Du droit de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9\" (arts. 1546-1560) the phrase \"action de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9\" occurs only once, viz., in art. 1562. One of the chief reasons, therefore, for the construction placed by the French authors upon the language of art. 1662 C.N. does not exist in regard to art. 1550 of the Quebec Civil Code, and in view of the changes made in the terms in which arts. 1664, 1668, 1669, 1671 and 1672 of the Code Napol\u00e9on have been substantially reproduced in the Quebec Civil Code, there seems less reason than in other cases where that occurs for the conclusion that in reproducing art. 1662 C.N. in ipsissimis verbis the Quebec codifiers meant to adopt it with the construction placed upon it by the French authors. The phrase \"cette faeult\u00e9\" in art. 1552 C.C. I think obviously refers to \"facult\u00e9 de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9\" in arts. 1546 and 1548 and not to \"action de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9\" in art. 1550.\nBut a stronger argument in favour of the contention of the appellant is presented by the clear and unequivocal terms of the English version of art. 1550. Whatever may be said of the meaning of the phrase, d'avoir exerc\u00e9 son action de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9, there can be no room for doubt as to the meaning of the words \"to bring a suit.\" Both the English and the French versions of the Code are of equal authority. The article in question is one which changed the pre-existing law and in such a case where there is a difference between the English and the French texts art. 2615 provides that\nthat version shall prevail which is most consistent with the intention of the article and the ordinary rules of legal interpretation shall apply in determining such intention.\nIn the present case there is in reality no difference between the English text and the French text if the language of the latter be given its primary meaning. Whatever secondary meaning may be attached to it where the contract seems to require a different construction, the primary meaning of action de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 is \"action of redemption.\" The two versions of the Code must be read together, and, while one may undoubtedly be used to interpret the other, where the language used in each taken in its primary sense means a certain thing and in the English version is not susceptible of any other meaning the fact that French authorities have put another construction on the words of the French version when accompanied by a different context does not seem to afford a sufficient ground for departing from the primary meaning. The language of Lord Herschell in Bank of England v. Vagliano Bros.[31], is applicable, to the Civil Code of Quebec: Robinson v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[32], at page 487. The comments of the Codifiers (vol. 2, pp. 18 & 19) make it clear that it was their intention to amend the old law by doing away with its uncertainties and holding the parties to an agreement for redemption strictly to the term stipulated without allowing the courts to extend it or requiring a judgment to declare the right extinct. If in determining a question as to whether the English or the French version of the Code should prevail where they differ it is material to know in which language the provision was originally drafted, the fact that in the report of the Codifiers the authorities are cited under the English version in the title with which we are dealing would indicate that this portion of the Code had been originally drafted in that language: Vol. 2, p. 61.\nNo doubt it seems a harsh provision that a person entitled to redeem whose tender of the amount due has been wrongfully rejected should be obliged to bring suit for the enforcement of his right within the stipulated term as a condition of preserving it. Moreover the obligation of bringing suit probably has the effect of curtailing the term within which the tender may be made and puts upon the vendor the necessity of anticipating that his legitimate offer may be wrongfully refused, and of leaving himself in that event, sufficient time to bring his action before the expiry of the term. But the existence of these obvious difficulties does not afford a sufficient reason, in my opinion, for ignoring the explicit and unmistakable language of the English version of art. 1550.\nI am, for these reasons, with great respect, of the opinion that this appeal should be allowed.\nBrodeur J.\u2014This appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Crepeau & Cot\u00e9,\nSolicitor for the respondent: Arthur Girouard.\n[1] Q.R. 25 K.B. 464.\n[2] [1891] A.C. 107.\n[3] 9 Moo.

The \"Honoreva\", (1916) 54 S.C.R. 51\nDate: 1916-10-16\nPercy Charles Bonham (Owner of the Barge \"Maggie,\") (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nThe Ship \"Honoreva\" (Defendant) Respondent.\n1916: May 18, 19; 1916: October 16.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies, Idington, Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE QUEBEC ADMIRALTY DIVISION OF THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA.\nAdmiralty law\u2014Navigation of canal\u2014\"Narrow channel\"\u2014Marine Department Regulations, rule 25\u2014Starboard course\u2014Fairways and mid-channels\u2014\"Canada Shipping Act,\" R.S.C. 1906, c. 113, s. 916\u2014Collision\u2014Liability for damages\u2014Canal Regulations, rule 22\u2014Right of way.\nThe steamboat \"Honoreva\" was under way going up the Soulanges Canal and approaching a bridge across the channel which was swung open when she was about 300 feet below it. The steam tug \"Jackman\" was then observed descending the canal, with the current, at a greater distance above the bridge and also under way. The \"Honoreva,\" in attempting to pass first through the abutments of the bridge (a space of about 100 feet in width), and keeping a course in mid-channel, came into collision with the barge \"Maggie,\" which was being towed by the \"Jackman,\" and the barge was injured and sunk. In an action for damages against the \"Honoreva\" she counterclaimed for damages sustained by her owing, as alleged, to the negligent navigation of the tug-and-tow.\nHeld, that the vessels thus navigating the canal were, at the place where the collision occurred, in a \"narrow channel;\" that article 25 of the rules of the Marine Department respecting the passage of vessels, which requires them when safe and practicable to keep to the starboard in fairways and mid-channels, applied to the navigation of the vessels in question, and that the \"Honoreva,\" having failed to obey that rule, was in fault within the meaning of section 916 of the \"Canada Shipping Act,\" R.S.C, 1906, chap. 113; that there was no negligence proven on the part of the tug-and-tow, and that the \"Honoreva\" was, therefore, solely liable for the damages resulting from the collision. Per Davies and Anglin JJ.\u2014Under sub-section b of article 25 of the rules of the Marine Department, the down-going tug-and-tow had the right of way, notwithstanding that the up-going vessel may have been closer to the bridge when it was opened, and that the tug-and-tow were not obliged to stop and make fast to posts\nuntil the up-going vessel had passed, as is required by the 22nd rule of the \"Canal Regulations\" in regard to vessels approaching a lock.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada affirming the decision of Dunlop J., in the Quebec Admiralty Division of the Exchequer Court of Canada, by which the plaintiff's claim for damages was dismissed with costs, and the defendant's counterclaim, on a reference for reconsideration, was maintained.\nThe circumstances of the case are stated in the judgments now reported.\nJ. A. H. Cameron K.C. for the appellant.\nHeneker K.C. and Chauvin K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I concur in the conclusion reached by Mr. Justice Idington.\nDavies J.\u2014I concur in the opinion stated by Mr. Justice Anglin.\nIdington J.\u2014This is an appeal against the judgment of the Exchequer Court maintaining a judgment of Mr. Justice Dunlop in favour of respondent.\nThe appellant sued as owner of the barge \"The Maggie\" sunk and lost or damaged by reason of a collision with the respondent in the Soulanges Canal when being towed by the tug \"Frank Jackman\" down said canal and about to enter the Red River bridge, crossing said canal.\nIt seems quite clear that the collision took place west of the bridge and, according to respondent's factum, when her stern was opposite the \"West Rest Pier.\"\nThe respondent was moving westerly and the tug-and-tow easterly.\nThe bridge is a swing bridge and when opened rests with either end on a cement pier. The easterly one is known as the \"East Rest Pier\" and the westerly one as the \"West Rest Pier.\"\nThe entire distance between the easterly side of the \"East Rest Pier\" and the westerly side of the other is a little over three hundred feet. The entire length of the bridge is a little over two hundred and twenty feet. It swings on a pivot half way between these piers. It is less than forty feet in width and occupies in itself but little space.\nThe water channel between the cement walls on either side of the canal underneath the bridge and its sweep of space in opening or closing and between these piers is one hundred and two feet in width\u2014or a few feet less in width than the general width of the canal for a long distance on either side of the bridge.\nThe water is of the same depth between the cement walls belonging to the bridge structure and that in the bottom of the canal on either side thereof.\nIn fact, the only practical difference in the channel passing under the bridge and that in the part after the bridge is passed, is that the cement walls are about perpendicular and the bank of the rest of the canal slopes up on each side thereof from the bottom of the general depth of the water. In considering this case and the draught of the respondent and circumstances herein the difference is of little consequence.\nThe rule of the road applicable to the case of meeting vessels is article 25, sub-sec. (a) which reads as follows:\u2014 Article 25 (a). In narrow channels every steam vessel shall, when it is safe and practicable, keep to that side of the fairway or mid-channel which lies on the starboard side of such vessel,\nenforced, as it seems to me, by article 17 of the \"Canal Rules and Regulations,\" which reads as follows:\u2014\n17. In all cases of vessels meeting in a canal, their passing shall be governed by the then existing rules and regulations of the Marine Department respecting the passage of vessels; and any violation of such rules shall subject the owner or person in charge of the offending vessel to a penalty of not less than two dollars and not exceeding twenty dollars.\nThe observance of these rules on the part of the respondent would have avoided the collision in question.\nA little regard for the rights and safety of others on the part of respondent would also have avoided the collision.\nThere never perhaps can be framed rules that will serve the infinite variety of circumstances arising in navigation and hence due care and use of a little common sense must be held binding upon all concerned as well as the due observance of the written law.\nWhether any two vessels should ever attempt to meet and pass each other in such a place as between the walls and piers at and under this bridge must depend largely on the size and structure of the craft involved in the movement.\nNo one would pretend that two row-boats or two small launches or small tug-boats without any tow should never attempt to pass each other in that part of the canal simply because there was a swing bridge overhead.\nNor do I imagine that two such vessels as respondent, or as she and the tug and tow in question, should try to do so.\nHaving outlined the situation and what I conceive to be the law applicable, there are a few outstanding contentions set up which I wish to dispose of without pretending to enter upon all the points of dispute raised herein.\nThe appellant claims that his vessel had the right of way because there is a current and he was moving with the current.\nI am not inclined to dispute his contention in a proper case but his tug-and-tow failed to reach the place where they might have asserted such a right and they failed to signify, either by what some assert is the usual practice or in any other way, the intention to claim what I assume, without expressing any definite opinion, might have been their right.\nMoreover, counsel at the trial did not in launching this case found anything upon that pretension. All involved therein seems to me should be set aside from consideration herein.\nThe respondent's pilot and others pretend they did not see the tug-and-tow till within three hundred feet. All I need say is that, in my opinion, if they did not they should have seen them earlier, as it was broad daylight and no reason why a proper lookout should not have observed the tug-and-tow when a mile away as those on the latter, with probably less chance of observation, did see respondent at that distance.\nI can find no excuse therefor unless I find it in the anxiety for dinner or laziness. Nay, more, if a proper lookout had been kept the pilot in charge should have known the situation better and governed himself accordingly.\nIf he had done so he would not or should not have persisted in keeping to the centre line of the narrow channel when it was so easy to have kept to the starboard without running the slightest risk or inconvenience.\nIf he had tried to get into a position where he would have been enabled to observe the letter of the law when he reached the place where the collision took place, he would then have put his vessel on the starboard side of the channel and there would have been no such collision as took place unless there had been more unjustifiable conduct on the part of the tug-and-tow than appears.\nThe letter of the law, to say nothing of the reasonable conduct called for under the the circumstances on the part of the pilot had he realized as he should have done the actual situation, demanded that the respondent, ought to have been at her point of progress where the collision took place on her own side of the channel.\nFor these reasons I think the appeal should be allowed and the respondent be condemned to pay damages.\nThe case of Dairies v. Mann[1] is, strangely enough, relied upon by respondent.\nI should rely upon it as furnishing that law of reason and common sense (which ought to be identical) which forbade the respondent, if due care and proper outlook had been kept, from running down this tug-and-tow even if, by the folly of their managers, tethered like the donkey in the wrong place.\nMy difficulty in the case begins there, however.\nAt common law the respondent in such a case would be cast for the whole damages.\nCan we find anything in the conduct of the tug-and-tow to blame?\nGiving due heed to the excuses put forward for being placed where they were I cannot quite excuse them for taking all the risks they did.\nIt seems impossible to be quite sure whether the effect of the movement of respondent in the water produced all the results in the movement of the tow which are described.\nIt would have been so easy after whistling its intentions, by a single blast, of going to starboard for the tug to have tried to remain still for a few minutes or to have got to the starboard side and tried to remain so still, when it had evidently lost its chance of priority in entering the bridge area that I cannot acquit it of all blame.\nI think it was the minor offender. It was smaller than respondent and the insolence of the stronger, who will not be just, cannot be too often rebuked and made to bear the consequences of disregarding the rights of others.\nI shall be governed by others of this court taking my view of respondent's action in allotting the relative shares to be borne of the damages.\nThe counterclaim of course fails, in my view, and no need for entering upon the law bearing upon the case in that regard.\nI may, however, remark that those disposed to take the case of the ships \"A. L. Smith\" and \"Chinook\" v. Ontario Gravel Freighting Co.[2], for their guide, should observe that there the tug-and-tow were both owned by and under the direction of one common owner.\nAnglin J.\u2014An outstanding and most material fact, found by the learned trial judge, affirmed on appeal to the Exchequer Court and supported by the evidence of the witnesses for the defence as well as that of the witnesses for the plaintiff, is that, when the collision which forms the subject of this action occurred, the up-coming steamship, the \"Honoreva,\" was in mid-channel. If she was rightly there\u2014if she had an exclusive right of way\u2014if it was the duty of the down-going tug-and-tow at their peril to have avoided her, then the judgments in appeal are well founded. They rest on this basis, held by the learned trial judge, and affirmed by the learned judge of the Exchequer Court, as a matter of law and upon the construction of the rules deemed applicable to the circumstances. If, on the other hand, the down-going tug-and-tow had right of way, or if both vessels were equally entitled to the right of passage through the bridgeway, then the \"Honoreva\" was at fault in holding the mid-channel and the judgments in her favour cannot be supported.\nIf the judgments in appeal depended on findings of fact, made upon conflicting evidence, I would be disposed not to interfere with them. In regard to several questions of fact, however\u2014some of them important, others probably not vital\u2014I am, with great respect, of the opinion that conclusions have been reached which indicate a grave misapprehension of the evidence. For instance, the learned trial judge states:\u2014\nThe \"Honoreva,\" when she was about to enter the opening of the bridge and when it was not possible for her to stop or to turn back, observed a steamer towing a large barge coming in the opposite direction.\nThe plaintiff's witnesses agree in stating that they saw the \"Honoreva\" when she appeared to be six or seven arpents (1150-1300 feet) below the bridge, they themselves being about the same distance above. The defendant's pilot, Daignault, says that the \"Honoreva\" was 300 feet below the bridge when he saw the down- coming tug immediately on the opening of the bridge. He adds that the tug was then a quarter of a mile, or 1,320 feet, above the bridge, the two boats according to this estimate being over 1,600 feet apart. Yet the learned trial judge says:\u2014\nThe pilot, Daignault, swears that the tug was about 300 feet away when it was first seen by those on board the \"Honoreva.\"\nDaignault adds that he concluded, when he first saw the tug on the opening of the bridge, that he would have time to pass through before the tug and barge would enter. He says he did not tie up to the right side of the canal below the bridge because he believed he had time to pass through; and that if he had anticipated the boats meeting in the bridgeway, he would, as a prudent man, have waited below the bridge. He went on because he was convinced that he had time to pass through. From this evidence it is abundantly clear that the \"Honoreva\" could have stopped below the bridge after her pilot saw the approaching tug-and-tow.\nWhen the bridge was opened the \"Honoreva\" was ascending the canal in mid-channel at a speed of about four miles an hour. She probably slowed down to 2\u00bd or 3 miles an hour while passing through the bridge. The tug-and-tow were descending at a speed of about 5 miles an hour and maintained that speed. I have no doubt that the \"Honoreva\" was in fact considerably nearer to the bridge than were the tug-and-tow and that the estimate of witnesses for the plaintiff as to the distance of the \"Honoreva\" below the bridge when they first saw her is erroneous. I accept Daignault's statement that she was then about 300 feet below the bridge.\nThe learned judge further holds that Daignault would have seen the tug sooner if the latter had whistled to have the bridge opened. He might have heard such a signal, although those on board the tug did not hear the like signal given by the \"Honoreva;\" but, according to the evidence, the bridge until opened probably obstructed the view and would have prevented the tug-and-tow being seen from the \"Honoreva;\" and Daignault says he saw the tug as soon as the bridge was opened.\nIn the fifth paragraph of the statement of defence, it is stated that chief officer Denwoodie of the \"Honoreva\" was on the forecastle head on the lookout. No doubt he should have been there. There is no suggestion that there was any other lookout. Denwoodie gives this evidence:\u2014\nQ. Did you see the accident? A. No.\nQ. Where were you? A. I was getting dinner in the saloon.\nQ. Therefore you know nothing about the accident? A. No.\nQ. You were downstairs? A. Yes.\nThe failure of those in charge of the \"Honoreva\" to see the tug earlier, if the bridge did not prevent it, was probably due to this absence of lookout. The tug is blamed for not having signalled for the opening of the bridge. But it was opened on the signal of the \"Honoreva\" given when she was 500 feet below the bridge and while the tug was still over 1,300 feet above it. There was no obligation upon her to give an unnecessary signal.\nShortly after the opening of the bridge, signals were exchanged between the two vessels to indicate upon which side they intended to pass one another. The learned judge states:\u2014\nThe \"Honoreva\" blew one blast of her whistle notifying the \"Jackman\" that she wished to pass her port to port, at the same time putting her helm to port. This latter signal was answered properly by the \"Jackman.\"\nThe fact, as deposed to by the plaintiff's witnesses and also by the pilot Daignault, is that the \"Jackman\" first signalled by one blast of her whistle for a starboard course and that the \"Honoreva\" by a like signal replied accepting that course. There is no evidence that the \"Honoreva\" first signalled for a starboard course. If, as the learned judge says, and plaintiffs witnesses thought was the case, the \"Honoreva\" put her helm to port when the signal for a starboard course was given (a fact which the \"Honoreva's\" witnesses deny), she must have reverted to the mid-channel course very shortly afterwards, because the testimony of Daignault and of all the other witnesses is explicit that in passing through the bridge she held the mid-channel. If the helm of the \"Honoreva\" was momentarily put to port, as the learned judge finds, that fact affords an explanation of the statement of the plaintiff's witnesses that, if the \"Honoreva\" had held the course then taken, or the course they properly assumed she had taken, in view of her response to the \"Jackman's\" signal, the passage could have been safely effected and the collision would not have happened. Indeed, Vernier, the captain of the tug, appears to have been under the mistaken impression that the \"Honoreva\" had gone to starboard when she answered the tug's signal, had maintained a starboard course when coming through the bridge piers and, as he puts it, \"sheered\" to mid-channel only very shortly before the collision. According to the evidence of Daignault the \"Honoreva\" maintained her mid-channel course until she was clear of the bridge, and her helm was then put to port. Very shortly afterwards\u2014according to the evidence of the assistant engineer, Stewart, either a couple of seconds before or a couple of seconds after the collision (he puts it both ways)\u2014the engines of the \"Honoreva,\". which had been at \"dead slow forward\" were reversed to \"full speed astern.\" The effect of the change of helm and reversal of engines probably was to deflect the bow of the \"Honoreva\" slightly to starboard at the moment of the collision and to throw her stern somewhat to port. This accounts for the fact that the vessel was struck 30 feet abaft her stem. But, as deposed to by the bridge keeper, Sauv\u00e9, and other witnesses, the \"Honoreva\" still occupied the mid-channel at the moment of the collision. The learned judge of the Exchequer Court says that this testimony of Sauv\u00e9 corroborates the evidence for the \"Honoreva.\" As the learned trial judge puts it:\u2014\nThe \"Honoreva\" proceeded to pass through in mid-channel. The \"Honoreva\" had not only entered the bridge but had practically passed through before the collision occurred.\nIt may, therefore, be taken as conclusively established that when the collision occurred the \"Honoreva\" was still in mid-channel.\nIn order to make the situation clear it is advisable to state a few other material facts which the evidence seems to place beyond doubt:\nThe \"Honoreva\" was 240 feet long by 36 feet wide and, as laden, drew about 14 feet.\nThe tug \"Jackman\" was 65 feet long and between 13 and 14 feet wide. The barge \"Maggie\" was 175 feet long, 26 feet, 4 inches wide. She was light. The distance between the stern of the \"Jackman\" and the bow of the barge was between 20 and 35 feet. The Soulanges Canal has a uniform width at the bottom of the channel of 100 feet, and its banks a slope of two feet to one. The approximate depth of water is between 16 and 17 feet. At the Red River bridge the width at top and bottom alike is 100 feet clear between piers. There is a current down the Soulanges Canal of about one mile an hour. There were at the time of the collision, and there still are tying-up posts on the north, or right bank ascending, below the Red River bridge. At the date of the collision there were no tying-up posts on the south, or right hand side descending, above the Red River bridge; such posts have since been placed there.\nThe tug \"Jackman\" passed clear of the \"Honoreva\" which was struck 30 feet abaft her stem by the barge \"Maggie,\" whose captain says:\u2014\nIl m'a frapp\u00e9 en joue de ma barge, \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s trois (3) pieds en avant de mon bateau de c\u00f4t\u00e9.\nThe force of the collision drove the \"Maggie\" against the south pier of the bridge with such violence that she received injuries which subsequently caused her to sink.\nSince the \"Honoreva\" was in the mid-channel, if not slightly to the south of it, she occupied at least 18 feet of the 50 feet of channel south of the centre line. It follows as an indisputable physical consequence that the port side of the tug was more than 18 feet to the south of the centre line of the channel and the port side of the barge nearly that distance south of the centre line when the collision occurred. This bears out the statement of the captain of the tug that he had placed his helm to port and taken the starboard side of the canal from the moment that he signalled to the \"Honoreva\" his intention to take that course. The evidence of the captain of the tug is that at the moment of the collision the tug was 6 or 7 feet from the south pier of the bridge and the captain of the barge says that the barge was 8 or 10 feet north of the line of the face of that pier. There is no contradiction of these statements. The tug had already entered the piers of the bridge when the collision occurred; the barge was still some 25 feet above them. As the learned trial judge finds,\nThe \"Honoreva\" *. * * had practically passed through before the collision occurred.\nWhen about 150 feet away from the \"Honoreva.\" the tug, already well to the starboard side of the canal, turned still farther to the right, but the barge did not immediately take the new direction, possibly owing to there being but a single tow line. In the effort to pull away from the \"Honoreva\" the tug also increased its speed. The barge maintained its course for a few seconds\u2014up to the time of the collision, the defence witnesses insist\u2014a circumstance which accounts for the fact that at the moment of collision, while the starboard side of the tug was within 6 or 7 feet of the south pier, the starboard side of the barge, although she was wider, was still from 8 to 10 feet north of the pier line. But it also shews that the course maintained by the barge had kept her port side from 13 to 15 feet south of the centre line of the channel. Yet the case has been treated in both the lower courts as if the tug-and-tow had maintained a mid-channel course until collision was imminent and had then first sought to pass to the starboard side of the channel. The learned judge of the Exchequer Court says:\u2014\nI think it is evident the captain of the tug miscalculated the space between the \"Honoreva\" and the port shore and ported her helm too late and then to make up for her negligence put on extra speed preventing the tug from colliding but throwing the barge to port.\nThe captain of the tug states that, although already well to starboard, he turned still farther to starboard, when a short distance from the \"Honoreva\" because he then realized that she was persisting in her mid-channel course and that collision was inevitable unless he could succeed in bringing the tug and barge farther to the south. With the \"Honoreva\" occupying 18 feet of the 50 feet of channel to the south of the centre line, there was left for the barge, 26 feet, 4 inches wide, only 32 feet of clear way to pass through.\nApart from the fact that there were no tying-up posts on the south side of the canal above the bridge, which affords most cogent evidence that down-going vessels were not expected to stop, there is uncontradicted testimony, if, indeed, it be necessary, that, whereas it is comparatively easy to stop a steamer ascending against the current, it is more difficult to stop a down-going steamer, and that when the down-going steamer is accompanied by a tow it is dangerous to attempt to stop or even to slacken speed. Had the \"Jackman\" slowed and thus lost control of her tow in the current, a very strong case of negligent navigation might have been made against her. \"The learned trial judge speaks of a \"common custom and rule\" that:\u2014\nNo two vessels are allowed to cross each other in going through the opening of the bridge, which is the narrowest part of the canal; the first one arriving has the right to proceed through the bridge, the other being tied up or at least remaining a sufficient distance to enable the first vessel to get clear of the bridge, which, it appears by the evidence, the \"Jackman\" did not do.\nI find no such rule in the record and no evidence of any such custom. Testimony bearing upon this particular matter is given by the bridge-keeper, Hector Sauv\u00e9, an independent witness, who says:\u2014\nQ.\u2014Lorsque deux (.2) bateaux viennent en sens inverse, est-ce que c'est l'habitude pour les bateaux qui remontent le courant d'accoster plus bas que le pont? R.\u2014C'est presque toujours ce qu'ils font; surtout la nuit.\nQ.\u2014Ils laissent passer le bateau qui descend, et passent apr\u00e8s? R.\u2014Oui. lis s'en rencontrent quelqu'un; mais la plus grande partie attendent en bas; ils se rangent \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9, ils arr\u00eataient compl\u00e8tement; il y en a d'autres qui passaient pareil.\nQ.\u2014Mais la prudence est de mod\u00e9rer en bas? R.\u2014Ils peuvent passer la m\u00eame chose. Although the pilot Daignault urges that because the tug-and-tow were so much farther above the bridge the \"Honoreva\" had the right of passage, he also says that if two vessels are about the same distance from the bridge the down-going boat has the right of passage.\nDaignault says that his object was to pass through the bridge and clear it before the tug-and-tow entered and that it was because he thought he had time enough to do this that he proceeded instead of tying-up below. Yet he also states that when about to enter the bridge he reduced the speed of his vessel from about 4 miles an hour to dead slow\u20142\u00be miles an hour\u2014although he then realized that the tug-and-tow were coming down fast\u2014he thought at more than 5 miles an hour. Daignault also makes the following statement:\u2014\nQ.\u2014Juste avant la collision, avez-vous cru que la collision \u00e9tait possible, avez-vous craint qu'il y \u00e0urait collision? R.\u2014Non monsieur.\nThis makes it clear, if further proof were needed, that the tug and barge were well to the starboard side of the canal, because Daignault of course knew the \"Honoreva\" was in mid-channel. He also gives the following answers :\u2014\nQ.\u2014A quel moment avez-vous donn\u00e9 le signal de faire Vitesse en arri\u00e8re sur votre bateau? R.\u2014Du moment que j'ai vu que la barge venait sur nous autres.\nQ.\u2014Et, est-ce qu'\u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 vous aviez tourn\u00e9 votre gouvernail de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 diriger votre navire \u00e0 droite? R.\u2014Oui, monsieur.\nRead with the evidence last quoted, this would indicate that the helm of the \"Honoreva\" was put to port only when Daignault at the last moment realized that a collision was imminent. Moreover, although Daignault swears that the reverse signal was given at the same time \u2014 he says a minute and a half before the collision \u2014 it was obeyed only a second or two before, or a second or two after, the collision according to the evidence of Stewart, who was then in charge of the engines. Stewart was not qualified to act as an engineer\u2014a direct violation of the statute, 8 Edw. VII., ch. 65, sec. 20, amending R.S.C. 1906, ch. 113, sec. 631, sub-sec. 1.\nFinally, it was stated by Henry Newbold, the engineer of the \"Honoreva,\" and by David Fitzpatrick, her captain at the date of the trial, both witnesses for the defendant, that there was plenty of water to permit of the \"Honoreva\" having passed quite close to the north pier of the bridge, that it was quite safe and practicable for her to have kept to the starboard side and within 5 feet of the north pier, in passing through the bridge. This evidence is uncontradicted. She was in fact 32 feet, if not more, south of the north pier.\nUnder section 24 of chapter 35 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1906, the \"Railways and Canals Act,\"\nThe Governor in Council may, from time to time, make such regulation as he deems proper for the management, maintenance, proper use and protection of all or any of the canals.\nRegulation 17, enacted by the Governor in Council under this statute, provides that:\u2014\nIn all cases of vessels meeting in a canal their passing shall be governed by the then existing rules and regulations of the Marine Department respecting the passage of vessels.\nArticle 25 of the\u2014\nRules for Navigating the Great Lakes, including Georgian Bay, their connecting and tributary waters, and the St. Lawrence River as far east as the lower exit of the Lachine Canal and Victoria Bridge of Montreal,\nadopted by order-in-council, 20th April, 1905, and amended 18th May, 1906, is as follows:\u2014\n(a) In narrow channels every steam vessel shall, when it is safe and practicable, keep to that side of the fairway or mid-channel which lies on the starboard side of such vessel.\n(b) In all narrow channels where there is a current and in the Rivers St. Mary, St. Clair, Detroit, Niagara and St. Lawrence, when two steamers are meeting, the descending steamer shall have the right of way and shall before the vessels shall have arrived within the distance of half a mile of each other give the signal necessary to indicate which side she intends to take.\nSection 916 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, ch. 113, (The \"Canada Shipping Act\"), enacts that\u2014\nIf in any case of collision it appears to the court before which the case is tried that such collision was occasioned by the non-observance of any of such regulations (for preventing collisions and for distress signals, of which the foregoing article 25 is one) the vessel or raft by which such regulations have been violated shall be deemed to be in fault unless it can be shewn to the satisfaction of the court that the circumstances of the case rendered a departure from said, regulations necessary.\nIf, as I think, the Soulanges Canal is a narrow channel, the \"Honoreva\" was guilty of a breach of paragraph (a) in having failed to keep to the starboard side of the fairway or mid-channel after the approach of the tug-and-tow became known. There is nothing to indicate that it was not safe and practicable for her to do so.\nIn passing through the bridgeway the \"Honoreva\" was undoubtedly in a narrow channel where there is a current. She was meeting the descending tug-and-tow. The latter under clause (b) had the \"right of way.\" In reasonable compliance with clause (b) the tug signalled for a starboard course. The \"Honoreva\" accepted that course by responding with a like signal. It was her clear duty thereafter to have taken and kept the starboard side of the channel. In distinct contravention of clause (b) she maintained a mid-channel course up the moment of the collision. She did so at her peril. There is no room for doubt that the collision between the \"Honoreva\" and the \"Maggie\" was occasioned by the non-observance by the \"Honoreva\" of the regulation contained in article 25. There were no circumstances in the case rendering a departure from that regulation necessary. On the contrary, the evidence of the defence witnesses themselves is that, instead of maintaining a mid-channel course with her starboard side 32 feet to the south of the north pier of the bridge as she did, the \"Honoreva\" could with perfect safety have passed through the bridegway within 5 feet of the north pier and in such a manner that she would have been well to the starboard side of the fairway or mid-channel. She could, while keeping the starboard side, have maintained a space of about 14 feet between her and the north pier. Her non-observance of article 25 clearly occasioned the collision. Had she obeyed it no collision would have occurred. She must, therefore, be deemed to have been in fault under section 916 of the \"Canada Shipping Act.\" Regulation 22 of the Canal Regulations, passed under the authority of section 24 of the \"Railways and Canals Act\" above quoted, is as follows:\u2014\n(a) It shall be the duty of every master or person in charge of any vessel on approaching any lock or bridge to ascertain for themselves, by careful observation, whether the lock or bridge is prepared to allow them to enter or pass, and to be careful to stop the speed of any such vessel in sufficient time to avoid a collision with the lock or its gates, or with the bridge or other canal works; any violation of this regulation shall subject the owner or person in charge of such vessel to a penalty of not less than five dollars, and not exceeding two hundred dollars.\n(b) All vessels approaching a lock, while any other vessel going in the contrary direction is in or about to enter the same, shall be stopped and be made fast, to the posts placed for that purpose, and shall be kept so tied up until the vessel going, through the lock has passed. Any violation of this provision shall subject the owner or person in charge of any such vessel to a penalty of not less than four dollars and not exceeding twenty dollars.\nParagraph (a) of this article relates to both locks and bridges, but is has to do not with the safety of vessels passing through them, but with the safety of the structures themselves, its purpose being, as the paragraph states,\nto avoid collision with the lock or its gates or with the bridge or other canal works. This paragraph has no application to the present case. Paragraph (b), on the other hand, applies only to vessels approaching a lock, and has no application to vessels approaching a bridge. The distinction between the language of the two paragraphs is marked. In the present case we are dealing not with vessels approaching a lock but with vessels approaching a bridge. Yet the learned trial judge would appear to have applied paragraph (b). He says the \"Jackman\" violated rule 22 in that:\u2014\nShe should have slowed down at a reasonable distance from the bridge or tied at the posts provided for that purpose.\nHe apparently entirely overlooked the fact that there were no \"posts provided for that purpose\" to which the \"Jackman\" could have tied. Again he refers to \"the rule\" that\u2014\nNo two vessels are allowed to cross each other in passing through the opening of the bridge which is the narrowest part of the canal. The first one arriving has the right to proceed through the bridge, the other one being tied up or at least remaining at a sufficient distance to enable the first boat to get clear of the bridge, which it appears from the evidence the \"Jackman\" did not do.\nThis misapprehension as to the application of rule 22 is the foundation of the learned judge's judgment, which rests upon his view that because the \"Honoreva\" was about to enter the bridgeway, clause (b) required that the down-going \"Jackman\" and her tow should have been stopped, made fast to posts and kept tied up until the up-going vessel had cleared the bridge. Not only is there no such rule applicable to the case of a bridge, but, according to the evidence of the bridgeman, Sauv\u00e9, who was in the best position to know about it, although both vessels had the right to pass through simultaneously, and vessels do frequently so pass through the bridge in opposite directions, the more usual practice is for the up-going vessel to tie up below the bridge and await the passage of the down-going boat.\nThe pilot, Daignault, on his own admission, saw the down-going tug-and-tow when he was in a position to have stopped the \"Honoreva\" and tied her up and allowed the tug-and-tow to pass. He chose not to do so. He says he proceeded because he thought he had time to get through the bridge and clear it before the tug-and-tow would enter. He perceived that \"the tug was coming down quickly.\" Elsewhere he says he thought its speed exceeded 5 miles an hour. Nevertheless he had the speed of the \"Honoreva\" changed to \"dead slow\" and, in direct violation of article 25 of the rules of the road, he still maintained his course in mid-channel.\nDaignault says that sometime after replying to the \"Jackman's\" signal for a starboard course he gave three short blasts of his whistle by which he intended to call upon the tug to moderate its speed, but that the tug did not reply. Those upon the tug deny having heard any such signal. Assuming that it was given, Daignault must have known the difficulty and danger of slackening the speed of a down-going tug-and-tow owing to the current and, having received no response, he should not have assumed that the tug captain would attempt anything of the kind. He should have made allowance for the tug's encumbered condition. The \"Independence\"[3], at pages 115-6. Without asserting that it was the duty of the \"Honoreva\" to have tied up below (but see Montreal Transportation Co. and The \"Norwalk\"[4], at pages 441-2; The \"Talabot\"[5], at page 195; The \"Ezardian\"[6]; \"Earl of Lonsdale\"[7]), or questioning her right to have proceeded through the bridgeway simultaneously with the tug-and-tow, if those in charge of her saw fit so to proceed they were bound to conform to article 25 of the rules of the road by keeping to the starboard side of the fairway. To do so was safe and practicable and they had themselves assented to the adoption of that course. There were no circumstances which excused, still less rendered necessary, a departure from the regulation. They maintained the mid-channel course at their own peril. They thereby put themselves in fault and must be held answerable for the consequences.\nOn the other hand, was there fault on the part of the tug-and-tow which contributed to the collision? Their right to pass through the bridge is clear. In doing so their duty was likewise prescribed by article 25\u2014it was to keep to the starboard side of the fairway. That they did so seems, upon all the evidence, to be beyond question. From the moment that the tug entered the bridgeway the facts in evidence prove that neither tug nor barge was at all near the mid-channel. The \"Honoreva,\" by wrongfully occupying the mid-channel, took up 18 feet of the waters which should have been left open for the passage of the tug-and-tow. The latter were thus obliged to attempt the difficult feat of passing the up-coming steamer with \u00e1 clear way only 32 feet wide, although the width of the barge was 26 feet, 4 inches. Assuming that she should succeed in exactly maintaining the middle of the 32 feet thus left to her, there would be only 2 feet, 10 inches on the port side between her and the \"Honoreva\" and only 2 feet, 10 inches on the starboard side between her and the bridge pier. Fitzpatrick, captain of the \"Honoreva,\" gives this evidence :\u2014 Q.\u2014How close to the pier or wharf would it have been safe to go? A.\u2014Within 10 feet\u2014within 5 feet, but as a general rule the farther off the safer you are.\nThe \"Honoreva\" had no right to force the tug and barge into a position where they had only 32 feet of water in which to navigate. Complaint is made that the tug went farther to starboard when only 150 feet from the \"Honoreva\" and that the barge, owing to its having a single tow line, did not immediately follow but maintained its course or even sheered slightly to port. Assuming this to be the case, the manoeuvre of the tug was made when collision seemed imminent and in an attempt to escape. The \"Honoreva,\" whose fault created the critical situation, cannot complain of the failure of this manoeuvre. The captain of the tug did the best he could in an emergency which he had no reason to anticipate the \"Honoreva\" would create. The tug-and-tow were already so well to starboard that pilot Daignault, who of course knew that his own ship was in mid-channel, did not expect a collision until immediately before it occurred. Why should the captain of the tug have anticipated it earlier? In fact, notwithstanding the very small margin of safety left to him, he appears to have taken the step he did to avoid or minimize the impending collision before anything was done on the \"Honoreva\" for that purpose.\nComplaint is also made of the speed of the tug. But there is no evidence that this was excessive. On the contrary, the evidence is that she was travelling at the rate of about 5 miles an hour, whereas the canal regulations appear to contemplate a speed up to 7\u2153 miles an hour.\nAgain it is charged that the tug was at fault in not slackening speed in answer to the signal of the \"Honoreva.\" Upon the evidence I incline to the view that that signal, if given, was not heard. Not only has no specific rule been cited which imposed an obligation on the tug to slacken her speed, but had she in doing so lost control of the barge, as might not improbably have happened owing to the current, she would have laid herself open to a charge of negligent navigation.\nUnder such circumstances the statutory rule requiring that steamships approaching one another so as to involve risk of collision shall slacken speed, or stop and reverse if necessary, cannot be invoked.\nIt is further urged that there was no person at the helm of the \"Maggie.\" There is some suggestion of this in the defence evidence\u2014but it is rather a surmise than a statement of fact. The pilot, Daignault, merely says that he \"did not remark anybody at the wheel of the barge.\" There is nothing more. On the other hand, the evidence of Captain Castonguay is perfectly clear and satisfactory on this point. He took the wheel from Laferri\u00e8re when the tug signalled for a starboard crossing. His evidence is corroborated by Josephus Thauvette who had given over the wheel to Laferri\u00e8re a short time before. The barge probably did not at once, take the new direction given it by the tug just before the collision. But this does not prove either the entire absence of a man at the wheel, or that, if there, he neglected his duty, or that anything he could then have done would have prevented the collision.\nOn the whole in my opinion, the only proven fault which clearly contributed to causing the collision was the flagrant breach by the \"Honoreva\" of the provisions of article 25 of the rules of navigation, which required her to keep the starboard side of the fairway. While the utmost skill may not have been displayed in the management of the tug and the barge when collision was imminent, while it may be that if there had been a bridle between them as well as a tow rope, the collision would have been avoided (I think this extremely doubtful), there is not, in my opinion, any sufficient proof of fault such as would impose liability upon them. Marsden on Collisions, p. 3; The \"Cape Breton\" v. Richelieu and Ontario Navigation Co.[8], at page 591; The \"Arranmore\" v. Rudolph[9], at page 185.\nI would for these reasons set aside the judgment of the learned judge of the Admiralty Court, and the confirmatory judgment in the Exchequer Court, and would direct that judgment be entered for the plaintiff declaring him entitled to the damages for which he sues and the costs of this action as well as of the appeals to the Exchequer Court and to this court, condemning the defendant and its bail in such damages and costs, and directing that an account should be taken by the registrar of the Admiralty Court, assisted by merchants, of the amount of such damages, with the usual provisions for report, etc. The counterclaim should also be dismissed with costs throughout.\nBrodeur J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed with costs and that the \"Honoreva\" should be held entirely liable for the collision.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J.

The bill of lading for the voyage to St. John provided that the fruit would be delivered there in the like good order and condition as when received subject to exceptions and stipulations including injury from \"effects of climate\" or from negligence. The ship stopped for some hours at Halifax, opened the hatches and discharged other cargo, and, either while at Halifax or before arriving at St. John, the whole consignment was frozen.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from (Q.R. 25 K.B. 325), that the injury to the fruit was due to the effects of climate and the terms of the bill of lading relieved the shipowners from liability therefor even though they may have been guilty of negligence.\nThe consignee of the fruit, who alone brought action against the carriers, had a dormant partner entitled to share with him the profits of the transaction.\nHeld, per Fitzpatrick C. J., that the proper parties were not before the court.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of King's Bench, Appeal Side, for the Province of Quebec[1], reversing the judgment of the Court of Review in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe material facts are stated in the above headnote. H. N. Chauvin K.C. and E. G. Vipond K.C. for the appellant.\nA. Chase Casgrain K.C. for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This is an action brought to recover the value of a shipment of lemons which were frozen while in the possession of the respondents as common carriers.\nWhen the lemons were delivered to the respondents at Liverpool in January it appears by the bill of lading that some of the original packages were in a very frail condition, stained and recoopered and consequently more liable to be affected by frost. Immediately a special marginal note was made on the bill of lading to the effect that the company would not be responsible for the condition of the goods on their arrival.\nThe ship sailed in the beginning of January, arrived at Halifax, on the 16th of that month and at St. John, N.B., a few days afterwards. The lemons were frozen in transit. There is no satisfactory proof of the time at which the frost reached the goods. The bill of lading, however, contains clauses and stipulations which in terms cover the alleged cause of injury if we are to believe the port-warden who saw the goods when the hatches were first opened immediately on the arrival of the ship at Halifax. He says that several of the boxes of lemons which he then examined were frozen.\nThe bill of lading exempts from liability for loss or damage resulting from \"effects of climate\" and from \"perils of navigation.\" The port-warden says that the lemons were carefully stowed in the proper place in the ship and there is no evidence of negligence except that given by Mr. Vipond who expresses the opinion that lemons could not freeze when stowed between decks and he adds that the injury to the lemons must have been caused by leaving the hatches open after the arrival at Halifax. As against this we have the evidence of the port-warden who testifies to the condition in which he found the lemons on the arrival of the ship. There is in the bill of lading a negligence clause which extends the scope of the exception with respect to liability to acts of negligence of the company's servants or employees.\nThe law applicable to the facts of this case is very clearly stated by Lord Loreburn in Nelson Line v. Nelson &.Sons[2], at pages 19 and 20:\u2014\nThe law imposes on ship-owners a duty to provide a seaworthy ship and to use reasonable care. They may contract themselves out of their duties, but unless they prove such a contract the duties remain; and such contract is not proved by producing language which may mean that and may mean something different. As Lord Macnaghten said in Elderslie S.S. Co. v. Borthwick[3], at p. 96:\u2014\"An ambiguous document is no protection.\"\nHere we have, as I have already said, in the bill of lading exceptions and stipulations which in terms cover the injurious effects of climate, insufficient ventilation and heat holds. There is further the special entry on the bill of lading that respondent was exempt from responsibility on account of the bad condition of the goods when received and in addition a negligence clause couched in singularly clear and unambiguous terms: The bill of lading says the Steamship Company shall not be responsible for the\ninjurious effects of climate, insufficient ventilation or heat holds, risk of craft, of transhipment and of storage afloat or on shore * * * whether or not any of the perils, causes or things above mentioned, or the loss or injury arising therefrom be occasioned by or arise from any ACT OR OMISSION, NEGLIGENCE, DEFAULT OR ERROR IN JUDGMENT of the master, pilot, whether compulsory or not, officers, mariners, engineers, refrigerating or otherwise, crew, stevedores, ship's husbands or managers, or other persons whatsoever whether on board said ship or on shore.\nThe binding effect of such a clause cannot be doubted. Vide Halsbury, vol. 26, p. 116, par. 197, and Fuzier-Herman, Repertoire, vbo. \"Armateur,\"\nNo. 178:\u2014\n178.\u2014L'armateur peut donc, comme le commissionnaire de transport, et m\u00eame \u00e0 plus forte raison, stipuler l'affranchissement complet de la responsabilit\u00e9 des fautes du capitaine ou de l'\u00e9quipage, \"responsabilit\u00e9 purement civile et au second degr\u00e9, en pr\u00e9sence de laquelle subsiste la responsabilit\u00e9 engag\u00e9e du garant direct, le capitaine.\" Cette doctrine d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e, pour la premi\u00e8re fois en 1869, par M. l'avocat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Raynal a \u00e9t\u00e9, depuis, consacr\u00e9e par de nombreuses decisions de la Cour de Cassation, et Ton peut dire que la jurisprudence est aujourd'hui d\u00e9finitivement fix\u00e9e en ce sens.\u2014V. les conclusions de M. de Raynal, sous. Cass., 20 janv. 1869, Messageries imp\u00e9riales (S. 69. 1. 101, P. 69, 247, D. 69. 1.94).\nI would have also been prepared to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the proper parties are not before the court.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellant by his accepting the first bill of lading given in Italy in order to secure a through rate, bound himself to accept such bill of lading (no matter how heavily laden with conditions or exceptions) as any intermediate carrier, for example a shipping company at London, in the course of through transportation contemplated, chose to impose.\nThe contract which thus came to be made at London is no doubt most onerous and at first blush somewhat ambiguous.\nIt was clearly intended thereby, that the carrier should run no risk, and the unfortunate shipper should, if possible, bear all the risks, of every kind that the long experience of generations of carriers have discovered might be run by them in the course of their business. It seems clear from reading this wonderful instrument that so soon as a new risk had been discovered, some new words were introduced into the form of bills of lading used by these carriers. Thus there had grown as quaint and complex a document as legal knowledge of decided cases and mariners' experience could suggest, well suited to entrap the unwary shipper tempted to accept a through rate and shut his eyes to all implied therein.\nThe courts have occasionally found some of suchlike bills of lading ambiguous, and been enabled thereby to do justice by holding the respective carriers using them liable. For although these English carriers may contract themselves out of almost any liability, yet they are told by English courts of justice that the attempt to do so must be in such clear and explicit terms that those they contract with should, if they took care, be enabled to understand that they were doing so, or at least so far as the particular risks involved in the contract were in question.\nThe railway companies in this country and shipping carriers in the United States have been restrained by legislation from carrying the law of contract so far as the respondent's bill of lading now in question has attempted.\nI think in this case now presented for our consideration the respondent carrier has accomplished its purpose and so framed its contract that it is not possible for me to hold that the language is, when closely studied and carefully weighed, so ambiguous that I am unable to give it the meaning respondent stoutly contends for.\nMoreover we must observe the following stipulations in the contract:\u2014\nAny claim or dispute arising on this Bill of Lading shall, in the option of the Shipowner, be settled with the Agents of the Line in London according to British Law, with reference to which Law this Contract is made to the exclusion of proceedings in any other country. General average payable by cargo according to York Antwerp Rules, 1890.\nIn accepting this Bill of Lading, the Shipper or other Agent of the Owner of the Property carried expressly accepts and agrees to all its stipulations, exceptions and conditions, whether written or printed.\nWhy in the face of a contract, presumably under the circumstances made in London, and so expressly declared to be made in reference to British law we should have such profuse references to another law, I am not able to understand. Doing so only confuses things. Had the action arisen out of something happening on our railways then our Canadian legislation or Canadian law might perhaps have been instructive even if not directly binding the parties.\nAs the case stands I see nothing for it but that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014The principal point made by counsel for the appellant is that the two bills of lading, that dated the 9th December, 1910, and that dated January 2nd, 1911, must be read together and that the effect of clause ten in the earlier bill of lading is to qualify the terms of the second bill in such a way as to limit the operation of the exceptions set forth in the second paragraph of it to cases in which the causes to which injury to the shipments are ascribed could not have been counteracted by proper diligence on the part of the carriers. This argument must, I think, be rejected because it appears to me to be very plain that paragraph 10 in the earlier bill of lading is a provision in favour of the owner and not of the shipper; and I think their full normal effect must be given to the words in the 2nd paragraph,\neffects of climate * * * whether or not occasioned by * * * any act or omission, negligence, default or error of judgment of the * * * persons * * * for whose acts they would otherwise be liable,\nand that these words must relieve the respondents from any liability which they might otherwise have been subject to.\nSome question was raised as to the law applicable. The second bill of lading contains a paragraph plainly indicating that the intention of the parties is that it is the law of England by which the construction and effect of this instrument are to be governed. Such a stipulation is conclusive both under the law of England; Hamlyn & Co, v. Talisker Distillery[4]; and under that of Quebec; Art. 8 C.C.; Savigny (Guthrie's translation, 2 ed.) secs. 369, 370, pages 194 and 197; sec. 372, page 221 (note A.), page 227; Royal Guardians v. Clark[5], at page 251; Lafleur's Conflict of Laws, at page 149.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014Assuming that it is fully established that the freezing of the appellant's shipment of lemons was due to negligence of the respondents' servants, liability for such negligence is, in my opinion, clearly excluded by an express provision of the bill of lading under which the respondents carried this cargo. It is conceded, and in view of the terms of the original bill of lading with The General Steam Navigation Company it could not well have been contended otherwise, that the latter company had authority to tranship the appellant's goods at London, and to accept on his behalf from the forwarding steamship company a bill of lading in its customary form. It was in pursuance of this authority that the bill of lading in question was taken from the respondents and it is binding upon the appellant. It is not suggested that it is not in the respondents' usual form or that its acceptance was procured by any imposition, misrepresentation or concealment.\nThe question presented is solely one of construction. There is no ambiguity or inconsistency whatever in the terms of the bill of lading. I am unable to agree with the appellant's contention that it incorporates the provisions of the bill of lading issued by the original shippers, The General Steam Navigation Company. The clause relied upon for that purpose, viz.:\u2014\nThrough goods are also subject to all conditions of the company or companies which assist in their conveyance,\nin my opinion, refers solely to conditions of any company or companies which might take over the goods from the respondents for the purpose of forwarding them to destination. That this is the meaning of the clause invoked is, I think, sufficiently clear from its own terms. But if not, it is made so by the fact that it immediately follows another clause which stipulates that:\u2014\nIn arranging for through carriage the liability of the Furness Line is to be that of forwarding agents only.\nNo sufficient ground has been advanced for relieving the appellant from the clear and explicit provision of the bill of lading taken on his behalf.\nFor the foregoing reasons as well as those assigned by Mr. Justice Cross in the Court of King's Bench I am of the opinion that under the special terms of their bill of lading the respondents were exempt from liability for injury to the appellant's cargo due to climatic conditions although that injury was occasioned by negligence of the respondents' servants. Brodeur J.\u2014The appellant claims damages for lemons which were frozen in transit between London and St. John, N.B., on a ship belonging to the respondents.\nThe respondents contend that they are not responsible for the condition of those goods because by the bill of lading they were exempted from liability for damages caused by frost.\nThose goods were shipped from Italy to Montreal on a through bill of lading issued at Milazzo, Italy, by the General Steam Navigation Company. It was provided in the bill of lading issued by the latter company that those goods could be transhipped in England. When they reached England, the goods were handed over to the respondent company for the purpose of being transported to St. John, N.B.\nOne of the conditions of the new bill of lading was that the respondent company should not be responsible for injurious effects of climate whether or not\nthe loss or injury arising therefrom be occasioned by or arise from any act or omission, negligence, default or error in judgment of the master, etc.\nIt appears that when the ship came near Newfoundland they encountered a pretty severe frost and it is likely that the lemons got frozen at that time though the goods seem to have been stowed at the place where they should have been. It is in evidence also that when the ship reached Halifax the hatches were open for the purpose of discharging the cargo and that the lemons might then have got frozen.\nHowever, the respondents claim that according to their contract they could not be held liable for negligence, default or error. Their bill of lading was accepted without any objection and became the contract determining the rights and obligations of the parties. It was provided also by that bill of lading that it would be interpreted according to the laws of England and it has been proved in the case that under the provisions of that law that bill of lading with such a clause was good and valid.\nBut it was contended on the part of the appellant that the new bill of lading issued in London by the respondent company was subject to the conditions and clauses of the original bill of lading. It appears in the original bill of lading issued in Italy that the vessel owners undertook to exercise care and diligence in the carrying of goods and that the latter clause would then be contrary to the provisions of the second bill of lading issued by the respondent company.\nI am unable to find in the latter bill of lading any provisions by which all the conditions and obligations mentioned in the original bill of lading would affect the respondent company. It was even stipulated in the original bill of lading that in the event of transhipment the clauses, conditions and restrictions of the ship or other conveyance by which the goods are forwarded to destination were included in the original bill of lading in addition to the conditions therein stipulated.\nThe contract then could be modified by any new ship owner; and as in the present case the respondent company undertook to carry the goods but with the condition that it should not be responsible for the injurious effect of climate even if the loss arose from its own negligence or the negligence of its employees, it constituted a contract which unfortunately in the circumstances of the case would not give any relief to the appellant. Those conditions might be very unjust; but they are the stipulations accepted by the parties and the courts are bound to give effect to them.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Vipond & Vipond.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Casgrain, Mitchell, McDougall & Creelman.\n[1] Q.R. 25 K.B. 325.\n[2] [1908] A.C. 16.\n[3] [1905] A.C. 93.\n[4] [1894] A.C. 202.\n[5] 49 Can.

The complainant had been summoned to act as a grand juror for the assizes at which the trial took place. The complainant was present with the grand jury when it was charged and when the presentment of a true bill was made. While the bill was under consideration by the grand jury one of the jurymen to whom the complainant had stated that it was a deplorable case, but it had come to the pass that either he or the accused would have to leave the town, repeated this statement to other grand jurors. In the reserved case it was stated by the trial judge that the complainant had in no manner taken any part in the deliberations of the grand jury on the indictment.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from (Q.R. 25 K.B. 275), Anglin and Brodeur JJ. dissenting, that, in the circumstances stated in the reserved case, neither the fact of the presence of the complainant as a member of the grand jury nor the statement made by him constituted a well-founded objection to the constitution of the grand jury which had passed upon the indictment which therefore could not be quashed under the provisions of section 899 of the Criminal Code.\nPer Davies, Anglin and Brodeur JJ.:\u2014An indictment preferred after consideration in which a grand juror disqualified by interest had participated should be quashed. Rex v. Hayes (9 Can. Crim. Cas. 101) disapproved.\nPer Anglin and Brodeur JJ.:\u2014The reasonable inference from the facts stated in the special case is that the complainant was present with the grand jury during their deliberation upon the bill against the accused. The statement made by the complainant to the juryman B., and by him repeated to his fellow-jurymen, was calculated to influence them. It is impossible to know whether the complainant's presence and his statement, so repeated, did or did not affect the grand jury adversely to the accused. He is entitled to have it assumed that they did. He Was thereby deprived of his right to have his case passed upon by a duly qualified grand jury which was not improperly biased, and he thereby suffered prejudice within section 899 of the Criminal Code which warrants the quashing of the indictment.

Cas. 12) referred to.\nPer Anglin J.\u2014On a motion to quash an indictment found by a grand jury it is improper to admit evidence of what took place in the grand jury-room during the inquiry in regard to the indictment. Reg. v. Justices of Hertfordshire (6 Q.B. 753); Rex v. Lancashire Justices (75 L.J.K.B. 198); Reg. v. Meyer (1 Q.B. 173) and Reg. v. London County Council ((1892) 1 Q.B. 190) referred to.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, Appeal Side[1], dismissing a motion to quash an indictment on the charge of perjury against the appellant, whereon he had been convicted at the trial before Mr. Justice Globensky and a jury, at Sherbrooke, in the district of Saint Francis, Quebec.\nThe circumstances of the case and the questions submitted on the reserved case stated by the trial judge for decision by the Court of King's Bench, are stated, as follows, by Mr. Justice Cross, in his reasons for judgment in the court appealed from. (See Q.R. 25 K.B. at pp. 279 et seq.).\nThe appellant (Moise Veronneau) was found guilty in the Crown side of this court, in the District of \"St. Francis, in October, 1915, by verdict of a jury on a charge of having committed perjury.\n\"He appeals against the verdict, first, on the ground that the indictment should have been quashed because of bias on the part of one of the grand jurors who found the indictment, and, secondly, on the ground that the trial judge allowed an amendment to be made to the indictment of such a nature as was not permissible in law and allowed it to be made at too late a stage of the trial.\n\"The learned judge who presided at the trial has stated a case for our opinion on these points, and it appears from the statement that the charge against the appellant was laid by one Denis S. Bachand and that it was set forth in it that the alleged perjury had been committed at a preliminary inquiry held by the district magistrate into a charge made by the appellant against Bachand of having attempted to murder him (Veronneau).\n\"It also appears that Bachand was one of the grand jurors to whom the bills of indictment were submitted at the October term.\n\"A true bill for perjury having been returned, and Bachand being one of the jurors present at the return, the appellant, before pleading, moved to quash the indictment on the ground that Bachand was one of the grand jurors who had found the indictment and had said to Brault, another juror (who had repeated them at the sitting of the jurors) the words: 'C'est de valeur ce proc\u00e8s-la, mais au point o\u00f9 on est rendu la, il va falloir que moi ou Veronneau parte de Coaticook.'\n\"It further appears from the stated case that Bachand did not take part in the deliberations of the grand jury on the case against the appellant; that the words above quoted were uttered to Brault and by him repeated to the other jurors, but that it was not shewn that these words influenced the jurors or affected their decision. The motion to quash was dismissed. It further appears that, upon the trial being proceeded with, there was a variance between the charge as laid and the evidence, in that the perjury was charged to have been committed on October 30, 1914, whereas the appellant's deposition taken before the magistrate, and tendered in evidence at the jury trial, purported to have been taken on October 13, 1914. The appellant objected to production of the deposition as not being relevant to the charge, but the objection was overruled and the deposition was read.\n\"After all the evidence had been taken, counsel for the appellant submitted that the evidence related to testimony given on October 13, and that there was no evidence to support a charge of perjury committed on October 30.\n\"Thereupon the prosecutor moved to amend by substituting the word 'thirteenth' for the word 'thirtieth' wherever the latter appeared in the indictment.\n\"The amendment was allowed, and, upon being asked if he desired a postponement, counsel for the appellant declined to say anything. Counsel for the appellant and for the prosecutor then addressed the jury, and, after a summing-up by the judge, a verdict of guilty was found\n\"The questions to be decided are as follows:\u2014\n\"1. Did the fact of Denis S. Bachand being a grand juror affect the legal constitution of the grand jury, and could the grand jury lawfully find the indictment, Bachand not having taken part in the consideration of this bill? Was the judgment dismissing the motion to quash right?\n\"2. Was there error in the judgment permitting the amendment?\"\nThe judges of the court now appealed from unanimously answered the second question in the negative but, as to the first question, two of the judges, Carroll and Pelletier JJ., dissented from the opinion of the majority who decided that, in the circumstances, the constitution of the grand jury was not so affected as to prevent the finding by them of a true bill on the indictment.\nVerrett, K.C., and Cabana for the appellant.\nNicol K.C. and Shurtliff K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This is an appeal on a stated case.\nIn answer to the first question I would say the grand jury was regularly constituted notwithstanding that Bachand, who was the party complainant before the magistrate in this particular case, was sworn as a member of it. A grand juror is not sworn like a petit juror to try and a true deliverance make on the evidence submitted. His duty is to diligently inquire and a true presentment make of all such matters and things as shall be given him in charge or shall otherwise come to his knowledge. Until quite recently grand jurors might make presentments of their own knowledge and information without the intervention of any prosecutor or the examination of any witnesses. Vide Report of Royal Commissioners on English Draft Code, pages 32 and 33.\nAs to the proceedings before the grand jury, it is part of the stated case that Bachand, whose name was on the back of the indictment, was examined, but took no other part in the proceedings. In these circumstances, Bachand was not a stranger in the jury room. His presence is explained and accounted for by the fact that he was a witness before the grand jury in this particular case. And, if Bachand took no part in the proceedings, I do not think his mere physical presence somewhere about could affect the result of the grand jurors' deliberations or constitute an interference with the privacy of their proceedings. There is no impropriety in some one or more proper persons being present with the grand jury during their inquiries on bills of indictment: Reg, v. Hughes[2]. I have not overlooked Goby v. Wetherill[3]. The stated case might have been more explicit on this point, but when the judge states the fact to be that Bachand\nn'a aucunement pris part aux d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations qui eurent lieu au sujet du dit acte d'accusation.\nI think he must be assumed to mean that he took no part in the finding of the bill. It would have been wiser, however, for Bachand to have left the room after giving his evidence and, as a matter of ethics or propriety, he should not have been present in the box when the bill was returned.\nWe must assume for the purposes of this appeal that Bachand took no part, except as a witness, in the discussions or deliberations on this indictment or in the finding of the true bill, and I express no opinion as to whether if he had done so the indictment should have been quashed.\nI attach little importance to the observations made to Brault who was also a grand juror.\nDavies J.\u2014This appeal is one from a judgment of the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side), Province of Quebec, refusing, by a majority, to quash an indictment found against the appellant on the alleged ground that one of the grand jury which found the indictment was interested and biased, having been the prosecutor. I should say that if the facts proved had shewn Bachand to have taken any part in the proceedings or in the consideration of the bill found by the grand jury of which he was a member, as to which he was interested or biased, that would have justified the appeal and the quashing of the indictment.\nThe question is one of fact capable of being proved by evidence. The finding of the learned trial judge before whom the motion to quash was first made, that the proof established that Bachand did not participate in the proceedings of the grand jury upon this particular bill or in the consideration of the jury's finding of a true bill upon it, approved of by the court of appeal, if sustained by the evidence, is sufficient to dismiss the motion.\nI am of opinion that the evidence to shew this non-participation and non-interference was properly admissible and that it is sufficient to uphold the findings of the courts below.\nI cannot accede to the proposition that the fact of one member of a grand jury being disqualified from interest or bias with respect to one of the bills brought before that body for consideration, affects the constitution of the grand jury generally.\nSuch a disqualified person cannot take any part in the proceedings or findings of the jury with respect to the bill in which he is interested, but such disqualification is a personal and limited one and does not affect the constitution of the jury as a whole or the right of the juror so partially disqualified from taking part in all the proceedings or findings of the jury on other bills in which he has no interest or bias.\nThis question of the participation or non-participation of Bachand in the proceedings of the grand jury upon this bill, including their finding upon it, was the main and substantial question argued on this appeal. There were other subsidiary questions mentioned with respect to them. I do not think there was anything in them to justify this court in interfering with the judgment appealed from.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellant was indicted for perjury and the learned trial judge was moved to quash the indictment on the ground that the private prosecutor was a member of the grand jury which returned the bill as true.\nThe learned trial judge investigated the matter and dismissed the motion but reserved the point raised thereby together with another which developed during the trial.\nIn his stated case separate questions were asked. The court of appeal disposed, by their unanimous judgment, of the second, leaving only that bearing upon the motion to quash in regard to which in that court there were dissentient opinions which enabled the accused to appeal here.\nThe first question, which thus comes before us, was stated as follows:\u2014\nPremi\u00e8re Question.\nLe fait que Denis S. Bachand avait \u00e9t\u00e9 assign\u00e9 comme grand jure affectait-il la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 de la constitution du grand jury, et ce dernier pouvait-il l\u00e9galement rapporter comme bien fond\u00e9, l'acte d'accusation port\u00e9 contre V\u00e9ronneau, Bachand n'ayant aucunement pris part aux d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations qui eurent lieu au sujet du dit acte d'accusation, et la d\u00e9cision de cette Cour renvoyant la motion de l'accus\u00e9, \u00e9tait-elle celle qui devait \u00eatre rendue?\nThe law applicable to the question raised before the learned trial judge is stated in section 899 of the Criminal Code, as follows:\u2014\n899. No plea in abatement shall be allowed.\n(2) Any objection to the constitution of the grand jury may be taken by motion to the court, and the indictment shall be quashed if the court is of opinion both that such objection is well founded and that the accused has suffered or may suffer prejudice thereby, but not otherwise.\nThe fact that the private prosecutor took no part in the deliberations on the subject of the accusation seems to me conclusive against this appeal. His having been summoned and sworn as a grand juror seems to furnish no ground of objection. He was bound to obey the summons and be sworn. It was not competent for him to refuse, for the very good reason that the conduct of the matter lay in the hands of the Crown officer and might not come before that grand jury or they might be directed by the learned trial judge, under such circumstances, if he saw fit for good reasons to refrain from dealing with it.\nWe are asked to presume, notwithstanding the statement of fact contained in the question which is the boundary of any appellate court's jurisdiction herein, that in fact the private prosecutor so summoned as a grand juror did take part in the deliberations in question herein as such grand juror.\nIn other words, we are asked to presume not only against the stated fact but also against the presumption of law that he did so.\nThe presumption of law is that he did not and that the Crown officer in charge saw to it as part of his duty, if aware of his being a grand juror, that he was properly instructed in that regard either by the foreman or the learned trial judge or himself, and that due order of law was observed.\nPossibly he was a witness and, as such, before the grand jury for such length of time as the requirements of giving his evidence or otherwise relative to the presentation of the evidence in accordance with what convenience in the case might demand. Nothing further can be presumed as to the fact of his presence there.\nThen it is said he appeared with the grand jury when its foreman presented the \"true bill\" in court.\nAgain there is no presumption to be drawn therefrom. For aught we know he may merely have taken a seat in the places assigned in the court-room for the grand jurors which he was entitled to do, for many proper reasons. Other bills may, for example, have been returned by the foreman to the court at the same time as this, or have been expected to have been so presented.\nThe mere presentation by the grand jurors of a bill forms no part of their deliberations and determination. That is disposed of in the grand jurors' room and the finding there written is simply handed in to the court. Often judges presiding at a busy court direct, as they may, that the foreman alone or such number of jurors as directed may do so, without the whole panel appearing.\nAnd, assuming the worst that can be said of a private prosecutor appearing under such circumstances, it is specially directed by the final part of the statute I quote that unless the accused has suffered prejudice thereby the indictment must not be quashed.\nI cannot find anything deserving serious consideration in all that has been urged by appellant's counsel to maintain this appeal. To do so would, I submit, be a reversion to technicality which the Criminal Code and its predecessors did so much during last century to eliminate from the law, in order that justice might be done.\nI have assumed in favour of the decent administration of justice, but am not to be taken as expressing any opinion, that in law a convicted man is entitled to go free simply because his accuser formed one of those grand jurors who presented his case for trial. I express no opinion on that legal issue, nor shall I till need be.\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nAnglin J. (dissenting).\u2014The defendant appeals to this court under sections 1013(3) and 1024 of the Criminal Code from the judgment, on a case reserved under section 1014(2), affirming the verdict and conviction recorded against him on a charge of perjury. The opinion of the majority (Archambeault C.J., Lavergne and Cross JJ.) was delivered by Mr. Justice Cross. Carroll and Pelletier JJ. dissented on only one of the reserved questions, viz., whether a motion to quash the indictment had been properly rejected, which is therefore the subject of the present appeal.\nOn the 3rd of November, 1914, one Bachand, who had been unsuccessfully prosecuted at the instance of the defendant on a charge of attempted murder, laid a complaint against the defendant of having committed perjury in the course of that prosecution. The defendant having been committed for trial, his case came before the Court of King's Bench, in October, 1915. At this term of the court Bachand was a member of the grand jury. He was present in the jury-box when the grand jury was charged with the consideration of the indictment preferred against the defendant, and again when a true bill was returned. Before the defendant pleaded to the indictment a motion was made on his behalf that it should be quashed because of the presence of Bachand as a member of the grand jury, and also because Bachand had said to one Brault, also a grand juryman, the following words:\u2014 C'est de valeur ce proc\u00e8s l\u00e0, mais au point o\u00f9 on est rendu l\u00e0, il va falloir que moi ou Verroneau parte de Coaticook,\nwhich Brault had repeated to other members of the grand jury, while they were assembled for deliberation.\nIn the reserved case the learned judge makes the following statement:\u2014\nAvant adjudication sur cette motion, il fut \u00e9tabli devant la cour qu'en effet Denis S. Bachand avait \u00e9t\u00e9 assign\u00e9 comme grand jur\u00e9 pour le dit terme d'octobre, mais qu'il n'avait aucunement pris part aux d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations du grand jury sur 1'accusation port\u00e9e contre Verroneau. Il fut aussi \u00e9tabli que les paroles susdites avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 dites par Bachand \u00e0 Brault et que ce dernier les avait rapport\u00e9es dans la salle des d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations aux autres grands jur\u00e9s; mais il n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 aucunement \u00e9tabli que ces paroles aient influenc\u00e9 ces derniers et qu'elles aient eu pour effet de d\u00e9terminer leur rapport.\nIl est vrai que Bachand \u00e9tait dans la bo\u00eete des grands jur\u00e9s quand ceux-ci ont rapport\u00e9 l'acte d'accusation comme bien fond\u00e9 contre l'accuse.\nIn the respondent's factum it is stated that the fact that Bachand took no part in the deliberation upon this case\nwas proved by the affidavits of two witnesses before the court.\nThese affidavits are not in the record and, although their production has been demanded, are not forthcoming. In view of the strict provisions as to the secrecy of all that transpires in the jury-room, and the terms of the grand jurors' oath, I find it difficult to understand how the learned judge was in a position to make the statement which he does as to the abstention of Bachand from taking part in the deliberations on this case. Rex v. Marsh[4], at page 237; Rex v. Willmont[5]; Greenleaf on Evidence, par. 252; Taylor on Evidence, par. 943; Archbold, Criminal Pleading (23 ed.), page 103; 4 Blackstone's Com. par. 126. I am likewise at a loss to appreciate the force of the learned judge's observation:\u2014 Il n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 aucunement \u00e9tabli que ces paroles aient influenc\u00e9 ces derniers et qu'elles aient eu pour effet de d\u00e9terminer leur rapport.\nAs at present advised I incline to think that we should ignore both the statement that Bachand took no part in the deliberations upon the charge against Veronneau and also the statement that it was not established that the repetition of what he had said to the juror Brault influenced the grand jury.\nBut if we are bound by these statements made in the special case, it should be pointed out that it does not appear (as indeed it could not without impropriety, Taylor on Evidence, para. 943) whether the bill against Veronneau was returned by the vote of more than seven members of the grand jury; nor is there an explicit statement that Bachand did not vote upon the bill as a grand juryman although he had refrained from taking part in the deliberation. Bachand having been present in the jury-box when the jury was charged with the consideration of the case against the defendant, and again when the bill was returned, his presence in the jury-room while it was under deliberation seems to be a reasonable inference which is in nowise negatived in the case submitted.\nThe question reserved for the consideration of the court is stated in the following terms:\u2014\nLe fait que Denis S. Bachand avait \u00e9t\u00e9 assign\u00e9 comme grand jur\u00e9 affectait-il la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 de la constitution du grand jury, et ce dernier pouvait-il l\u00e9galement rapporter comme bien fond\u00e9, l'acte d'accusation port\u00e9 contre Verroneau, Bachand n'ayant aucunement pris part aux d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations qui eurent lieu au sujet du dit acte d'accusation, et la d\u00e9cision de cette Cour renvoyant la motion de l'accus\u00e9, \u00e9tait-elle celle qui devait \u00eatre rendue?\nIn answer to the appeal counsel for the Crown takes the position that there is no right of challenge to a grand juryman individually, that the remedy of an accused person in the case of a disqualified grand juryman was, prior to the Criminal Code, by plea in abatement, that such pleas have been abolished (Crim. Code, sec. 899), that a motion to quash in lieu thereof is permitted only in the case of an \"objection to the constitution of the Grand Jury\" (ibid.) and that an objection that a member of the grand jury was not indifferent because of alleged interest is not an objection to the constitution of the grand jury. The King v. Hayes[6]. His position, therefore, is that, although it should be assumed that Bachand took part in the finding of the true bill against Veronneau, and even that his vote was necessary to its return, nevertheless Veronneau would be without redress because the law affords him no remedy. In the alternative he maintains that, in view of the statements in the reserved case, that Bachand had taken no part in the deliberation of the grand jury, and that it was not proved that his conversation with Brault, though repeated to the grand jury, had in fact affected them, the court cannot properly hold, although the objection should be deemed well founded, that \"the accused has suffered or might suffer prejudice thereby.\"\nIt seems unnecessary to consider the somewhat debated question whether there is a right of challenge to the polls in the case of a grand jury. I appreciate the force of the argument ab inconvenienti pressed in the Sheridan Case[7], and incline to the view that under the old practice an objection to a grand juryman would be properly made when the accused was arraigned either by plea in abatement or by motion to quash the indictment. I agree with Mr. Justice Cross that either course would seem to have been open, the latter, however, being the only method available when, as may often happen, the defendant first became aware of the ground of objection after he had pleaded \"not guilty.\" Since the adoption of the provision of the Criminal Code abolishing all pleas in abatement the remedy is by motion to quash.\nI also agree with Cross J. that the view that the phrase \"any objection to the constitution of the grand jury\" (Crim. Code, 899, sec. 2), covers only objections based on lack by jurors of qualifications expressly prescribed by provincial statute law, or on disqualification of the officer charged with the duty of selecting and summoning the grand jury, seems to be too narrow. Anything which destroys the competency of the grand jury as a whole or the competency of any of its members, I think, affects the constitution of that body and affords a ground of objection which may be raised by a motion to the court under section 899. A grand juror may be well qualified as to all the cases on the docket save one and wholly unfit to pass upon that one. As to that case the jury would not be properly constituted while he sat upon it.\nIn the King v. Hayes[8], the contrary view was taken, apparently based largely upon what, with respect, would appear to have been a misconception of section 662 of the Criminal Code then in force.\nEvery person qualified and summoned as a grand or petit juror, according to the laws in force for the time being in any Province of Canada, shall be duly qualified to serve as such juror in criminal cases in that Province.\nApart from any question as to the constitutional validity of this section as a provision dealing with the constitution of the court rather than with criminal procedure, it should be noted that the qualification which it declared sufficient was not merely that prescribed by the provincial statute law, but qualification\naccording to the laws in force for the time being in any Province of Canada. I know of no law in force in any province which has taken away the common law right to object to a juror propter affectum or deprived an accused in the Province of Quebec of the right, which exists, as in Ontario and the other older provinces, before conviction for an indictable offence, to have his case passed upon first by a body of impartial grand jurors and afterwards by a petit jury likewise composed of indifferent men. 4 Blackstone's Com. para. 306.\nThe disqualification of interest\u2014propter affectum\u2014rests upon the common law maxim, \"that no man is to be a judge in his own case,\" which, as Lord Campbell said in Dimes v. Grand Junction Canal Co.[9],\nit is of the last importance * * * should be held sacred. And that is not to be confined to a cause in which he is a party but applies to a cause in which he has an interest.\nThe presence of one interested justice on a bench of magistrates renders the court improperly constituted and vitiates the proceeding, although the majority, without reckoning his vote, favoured the decision: Reg. v. Justices of Hertfordshire[10]. The same rule is applicable to a grand jury. The Queen v. Inhabitants of Upton St. Leonards[11]. The case last cited is also particularly in point because of the statement made by Bachand to Brault, and repeated to the other grand jurors, which not only put Bachand's interest in the prosecution beyond doubt, but was of a character\nnot unlikely to influence the grand jury in their decision.\nThe reasoning and grounds of decision of Peters, J., in The Queen v. Gorbet et al.[12], commend themselves to my judgment rather than those which prevailed in the King v. Hayes[13]. As already stated I am unable to agree with the view taken by Mr. Justice Cross that evidence was legally received that the juror Bachand, though apparently present in the grand jury room, did not participate in the discussion of Veronneau's case. It would, in my opinion, be a practice fraught with very grave dangers to enter upon any such inquiry. The illegality of the presence of a mere stranger in a jury-room is illustrated by the recent case of Goby v. Wetherill[14]. The presence of a person disqualified by interest, himself a member of the body, must be still more objectionable. Moreover, as already pointed out, the statement that Bachand did not take part in the deliberations of the grand jury on the Veronneau case not only does not negative his presence in the jury-room, but is not inconsistent with his having voted on the finding. The true principle, however, is that upon which the decisions in Reg. v. Justices of Hertfordshire[15], and Rex v. Lancashire Justices[16], and Reg. v. Meyer[17] proceed. As Blackburn J. said, in the case last cited,\nwe cannot go into the question whether the interested justice (juror) took no part in the matter (i.e., in the discussion of the case).\nSee also for a different application of the same principle, Reg. v. London County Council[18], at page 196. As to the statement of Bachand to grand juror Brault, repeated by the latter (probably in Bachand's presence) in the jury-room, it was of a character calculated to influence other jurymen and it is impossible to know whether it did or did not in fact influence them. Mr. Justice Cross was under the erroneous impression that the learned trial judge had found that the communication did not affect the decision of the grand jury.\nAll that the special case states is that:\u2014\nIl n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 aucunement \u00e9tabli que ces paroles aient influenc\u00e9 ces derniers et qu'elles aient eu pour effet de d\u00e9terminer leur rapport.\nThe effect of Bachand's statement upon the grand jury is a field of inquiry not open to us. The statement was improperly before them. It had all the weight of a communication from one of the body itself. The defendant is entitled to have it assumed that it produced some effect.\nThe accused has been deprived of the substantial right of having his case passed upon by a duly qualified and unbiased grand jury, and it was, in my opinion, quite impossible when the motion to quash was disposed of in the trial court to affirm that he had not suffered or might not suffer prejudice thereby. Rex v. Willmont[19] ; Allen, v. The King[20]. To hold, as was apparently held by one learned judge in the Hayes Case[21], at page 118, that, because the appellant was subsequently convicted by a petit jury at the trial, to which he was compelled to proceed upon the rejection of his motion to quash, it cannot be said that he was really prejudiced by anything which concerned the action of the grand jury, would entail a denial of redress in any case after conviction, however gross the improprieties accompanying the finding of the indictment, however prompt the action of the defendant in taking exception thereto, and however erroneous the rejection of his objections.\nIn my opinion, the motion to quash the indictment should have been granted and the question submitted should be answered accordingly.

A son tour, Bachand a port\u00e9 une accusation contre Veronneau l'accusant de s'\u00eatre parjur\u00e9 dans ce proc\u00e8s de tentative de meurtre.\nLe magistrat charg\u00e9 de l'enqu\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire a trouv\u00e9 mati\u00e8re \u00e0 proc\u00e8s contre V\u00e9ronneau sur l'accusation de parjure et un acte d'accusation a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis au grand jur\u00e9.\nCoincidence assez extraordinaire, nous trouvons que parmi les membres du grand jury se trouvait \u00eatre Bachand lui-m\u00eame. Aussi quand l'acte d'accusation a \u00e9t\u00e9 rapport\u00e9 comme bien fond\u00e9, V\u00e9ronneau a fait motion pour le casser sur le principe que le jury n'\u00e9tait pas legalement constitut\u00e9, vu que parmi les jur\u00e9s se trouvait \u00eatre son propre accusateur.\nUne preuve par affidavit a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite \u00e0 ce sujet et il para\u00eet avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli \u00e0 la satisfaction du juge qui pr\u00e9sidait au proc\u00e8s que Bachand n'avait pas pris part aux d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations. Il ne nous dit pas cependant si Bachand \u00e9tait dans la chambre o\u00f9 les jur\u00e9s ont d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9.\nIl est en preuve \u00e9galement que Bachand aurait dit \u00e0 l'un de ses coll\u00e8gues du grand jury qu'au point o\u00f9 on \u00e9taient rendues les choses \"il va falloir que lui ou V\u00e9ronneau parte de Coaticook.\"\nIl a \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9 \u00e9galement que Bachand \u00e9tait dans la bo\u00eete des grands jur\u00e9s quand ceux-ci ont rapport\u00e9 l'acte d'accusation comme bien fond\u00e9 contre Veronneau.\nLa question qui se pr\u00e9sente est donc de savoir si le jury \u00e9tait validement constitu\u00e9 pour rapporter Pacte d'accusation en question. Il n'y a pas de doute sur le fait que Bachand \u00e9tait membre du grand jury et qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 asserment\u00e9 comme tel.\nLe juge qui pr\u00e9sidait au proc\u00e8s a r\u00e9serv\u00e9 pour la d\u00e9cision de la cour d'appel la question suivante:\u2014\nLe fait que Denis S. Bachand avait \u00e9t\u00e9 assign\u00e9 comme grand jur\u00e9 affectait-il la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 de la constitution du grand jury et ce dernier pouvait-il l\u00e9galement rapporter comme bien fond\u00e9 l'acte d'accusation port\u00e9 contre Verroneau, Bachand n'ayant aucunement pris part aux d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations qui eurent lieu au sujet du dit acte d'accusation et la d\u00e9cision de cette cour renvoyant la motion de l'accuse \u00e9tait-elle celle qui devait \u00eatre rendue?\nLes r\u00f4les d'accusateur et de juge sont, d'apr\u00e8s les principes primordiaux de notre organisation judiciaire, absolument incompatibles; et la Couronne l'a si bien compris que dans la cause actuelle elle a prouv\u00e9 que l'accusateur, Bachand, n'avait pas pris part aux d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations qui ont eu lieu sur l'acte d'accusation porte contre Veronneau.\nLes faits qui nous sont rapport\u00e9s par le juge et qui font la base de la question r\u00e9serv\u00e9e ne sont peut-\u00eatre pas aussi d\u00e9taill\u00e9s qu'ils devraient l'\u00eatre., Ainsi, par exemple, je crois qu'il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 bien important de savoir si Bachand \u00e9tait rest\u00e9 ou non, pendant les d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations du jury. Le juge d\u00e9clare simplement qu'il n'a pas pris part aux d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations. Cela veut-il dire qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9sent dans la chambre o\u00f9 le jury a d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9? J'\u00e9tais enclin d'abord \u00e0 croire que le fait de mentionner qu'il n'avait pas pris part aux d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations aurait pu \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme encluant sa pr\u00e9sence mais qu'il n'avait pas assist\u00e9. Mais, r\u00e9flexion faite, je consid\u00e8re que la meilleure interpr\u00e9tation qui puisse \u00eatre donn\u00e9e \u00e0 cette expression du juge est que Bachand \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent mais qu'il n'a nullement pris part aux d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations.\nJe consid\u00e8re que dans les circonstances le jury n'\u00e9tait pas l\u00e9galement constitu\u00e9 pour porter un acte d'accusation.\nChitty dit:\u2014\nThis necessity for the grand inquest to consist of men free from all objection existed at common law and was affirmed by the statute 11 Henry IV., ch. 9, which enacts that any indictment taken by a jury, one of whom is unqualified shall be altogether void and of no effect whatever. So that if a man be outlawed upon such a finding, he may, on evidence that one of the jury was incompetent, procure the outlawry against him to be reversed.\nLe grand jury dans le cas actuel pouvait \u00eatre l\u00e9galement constitu\u00e9 pour entendre d'autres causes qui lui seraient soumises; mais, en tant que la cause de Veronneau est concern\u00e9e, je consid\u00e8re qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas l\u00e9galement constitu\u00e9.\nJe ne saurais, par cons\u00e9quent, concourir dans l'opinion exprim\u00e9e dans la cause de Reg. v. Hayes[22]. Je crois que le principe qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans la cause de Reg. v. McGuire[23], est plus acceptable et plus conforme \u00e0 notre organisation judiciaire.\nPour ces raisons, je serais d'opinion que l'acte d'accusation prof\u00e9r\u00e9 contre Veronneau devrait \u00eatre annul\u00e9 et que l'appel devrait \u00eatre maintenu avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Chas.

The plaintiff appealed to have judgment entered in his favour or, alternatively, to have the case remitted to the county court to have damages assessed, or for such further order as might be deemed proper by the Court of Appeal. The appeal was dismissed and the judgment appealed from affirmed. The British Columbia \"Court of Appeal Act\" (R.S.B.C., 1911, ch. 51, sec. 15, sub-sec. 3), provides that every appeal shall include a motion for a new trial unless otherwise stated in the notice of appeal. On motion to quash an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada on the grounds that the notice prescribed by section 70 of the \"Supreme Court Act,\" R.S.C., 1906, ch. 139, had not been given within 20 days from the date of the judgment appealed from and that the action was not of the class in which a county court had concurrent jurisdiction with a superior court, under section 37b of the \"Supreme Court Act\" limiting appeals to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nHeld, Duff J. dissenting, that no appeal could lie to the Supreme Court of Canada. Per Fitzpatrick C.J. and Idington J., (Duff and Anglin JJ. contra).\u2014 As the case was not one in which a county court is given concurrent jurisdiction with a superior court, under section 40 of the \"County Courts Act,\" R.S.B.C., 1911, ch. 53, the Supreme Court of Canada had no jurisdicton to entertain the appeal. Champion v. The World Building Co. (50 Can. S.C.R. 382), referred to.\n\"Per Anglin J.\u2014In the circumstances of the case the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia should be regarded as a judgment upon a motion for a new trial, within the meaning of section 70 of the \"Supreme Court Act,\" R.S.C., 1906, ch. 139, and, notice not having been given as thereby provided, there could be no appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. Sedgewick v. Montreal Light, Heat and Power Co. (41 Can. S.C.R. 639), and Jones v. Toronto and York Radial Railway Co. (Cam. S.C. Prac. 432), referred to.\nPer Duff J., dissenting.\u2014The judgment from which the appeal is asserted was not a judgment upon a motion for a new trial but a decision on the merits of the case upon an appeal by way of re-hearing by the Court of Appeal for British Columbia which had before it all the evidence necessary for that purpose. There being no ground on which either party could have demanded a new trial, section 70 of the \"Supreme Court Act\" had no application to the appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. Sedgwick v. Montreal Light, Heat, and Power Co. (41 Can. S.C.R. 639) followed. Further, the County Court derived its jurisdiction in the case in question from the provisions of section 30, sub-sec. 1, of the \"County Courts Act\" (R.S.B.C., 1911, ch. 53), and section 22 of that Act shews that this jurisdiction is concurrent; consequently, the County Court possessed \"concurrent jurisdiction\" with the Supreme Court of British Columbia within the meaning of section 37b of the \"Supreme Court Act,\" R.S.C., ch. 139, notwithstanding that the word \"concurrent\" is not employed in either of those sections of the \"County Courts Act.\"\nMOTION to quash an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia (10 West. W.R. 523), affirming the judgment of McInnes Co.J., in the County Court of Vancouver, dismissing the plaintiff's action with costs.\nThe circumstances in which the motion to quash the appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was made are stated in the head-note.\nW. N. Tilley K.C. supported the motion.\nR. M. Macdonald contra. THE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This is an action for damages brought in the County Court, in British Columbia, in which the plaintiff claimed some $560. His action was dismissed at the trial and this judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. The plaintiff now appeals to the Supreme Court of Canada and the case is set down for hearing on the \"Western List.\" No question of jurisdiction is raised in the respondents' factum, but they launched a motion on 16th June, last, returnable on the first day of this session of this court in which they asked to have the appeal quashed for want of jurisdiction. The Supreme Court Rules provide, by rule 4, that, within fifteen days after security is approved, the respondent shall move to quash for want of jurisdiction, and rule 5 provides that, upon service of the motion, all further proceedings shall be stayed unless a judge of the Supreme Court should otherwise order. The bond appears to have been made in June, although the exact date is not given, but the order allowing it is dated 2nd June, so that notice of motion was given promptly by the respondent. Notwithstanding the rules, the appellant has proceeded to print his case on appeal and file his factum and the respondents have also filed their factum, nobody appearing to pay any attention to rule 5 which stayed proceedings and which was expressly passed to avoid costs being incurred of the printing where the court might have no jurisdiction.\nThe jurisdiction of the court turns, in part, on the view to be taken of section 37(b) of the \"Supreme Court Act\" which gives an appeal where the amount in dispute is $250 or upwards and the court of first instance has concurrent jurisdiction with a superior court. The cases in which the County Court, in British Columbia, shall have concurrent jurisdiction with the Supreme Court of that province are set out in the Revised Statutes of British Columbia, ch. 53, sec. 40, and none of these covers an ordinary case of damages as to which the County Court is given express jurisdiction up to $1,000 by section 30 of the Act. If there is jurisdiction in this case, it means that every action in a county court in British Columbia, between $250 and $1,000 is appealable to the Supreme Court of Canada. There is no doubt that the Supreme Court of the province has jurisdiction in every kind of action, including the actions in which special jurisdiction is conferred upon the County Court and other inferior courts, but this cannot mean that because the Supreme Court always has concurrent jurisdiction with inferior courts an appeal therefore will lie. Our Act surely means that an appeal lies here only in a case where the inferior court is given concurrent jurisdiction with the superior court in matters which, without some express provision, would alone be cognizable by the superior court. Vide Champion v. The World Building Co.[1].\nMr. Justice Idington desires that I should add that he remains of the opinion expressed in the Champion Case[2].\nThe motion to quash should be allowed with costs.\nDAVIES J. agreed that the appeal should be quashed with costs.\nIDINGTON J. also agreed that the appeal should be quashed with costs, adding that he remained of the opinion he expressed in the case of Champion v. World Building Co.[3] DUFF J. (dissenting).\u2014The ground of the application is that this is an appeal from a \"judgment upon a motion for a new trial\" within the meaning of section 70 of the \"Supreme Court Act.\"\nThe circumstances are that, at the conclusion of the plaintiff's, appellant's, case, in a trial in the County Court of Vancouver, the defendants, respondents, moved for judgment and the trial judge granted judgment dismissing the action. The plaintiff, appellant, then appealed to the Court of Appeal praying, by his notice of appeal, a judgment of that court.\nreversing the judgment appealed from and directing that judgment be entered for the plaintiff for the sum of $578.59 or such other sum as to the Court of Appeal may seem meet or, in the alternative, remitting the said action to the County Court to have the damages assessed or such further order or judgment as to the said Court of Appeal may seem meet.\nThe plaintiff's complaint upon which the action was brought was that he had been wrongfully run down by one of the defendants' cars and the defence was contributory negligence. This defence the learned county court judge held to have been established. The Court of Appeal, in hearing the appeal, was exercising the powers conferred upon it by section 116 of the \"County Courts Act,\" section 6 of the \"Court of Appeal Act\" (R.S.B.C., 1911, ch. 51), and order 53, rr. 1-3a; these last mentioned rules providing that all appeals \"shall be by way of re-hearing\" and that the Court of Appeal\nshall have all the powers and duties * * * of the court or judge appealed from * * * to draw inferences of fact and to give any judgment or order which ought to have been made and to make any such further or other order as the case may require.\nThe plaintiff had, as above mentioned, completed his evidence in the County Court and the Court of Appeal had before it all the materials necessary to enable it to give judgment for the plaintiff, if he was in law entitled to it, on the facts established by that evidence. The defendants having deliberately taken the position that they were entitled to judgment on the evidence as it stood were not (if the Court of Appeal should be against them on the main issue) entitled as of right to demand that the case be remitted to the County Court even for the assessment of damages. No ground was or could be suggested for granting a new trial to the appellant if he should be held not entitled to judgment on the evidence before the Court of Appeal.\nThe Court of Appeal gave judgment dismissing the appeal on the ground that the defence of contributory negligence was proved and that the judgment of the county court judge dismissing the action was right.\nIn these circumstances it seems clear that section 70 of the \"Supreme Court Act\" has no application. The judgment of the Court of Appeal was a judgment upon an appeal \"by way of re-hearing\" in which the plaintiff prayed judgment for a specified sum for which he alleged judgment ought to have been given in the County Court on the evidence adduced before that court; it was a judgment declaring that, on that evidence, the County Court was right in refusing him judgment and dismissing his action. The plaintiff now appeals to this court asking that this judgment of the Court of Appeal be reversed and that judgment be given in his favour for the sum claimed in his action.\nThe fact that by the plaintiff's notice of appeal in the Court of Appeal alternative relief was prayed as well as the fact that the Court of Appeal had power to deal with the appeal by remitting the case to the County Court are nothing to the purpose. By section 15, sub-sec. 3, of the \"Court of Appeal Act\" every appeal includes an application for a new trial unless the notice of appeal expressly states otherwise.\nIt could not be argued that every appeal brought by such a notice is necessarily a \"motion for a new trial\" within section 70; it could not be so argued for the reason that until you looked into the merits you could not say that on the materials before the Court of Appeal it was not the duty of the Court of Appeal to give judgment in favour of the appellant.\nThat is precisely applicable to this case in which the Court of Appeal had, in fact, all the necessary materials before it and the defendants (respondents) had elected at the trial to stand on that material and to ask that the issues between them and the plaintiff should be determined according to the effect of that material.\nIn Sedgwick v. Montreal Light, Heat and Power Co.[4], at page 642, this court unanimously concurred in the following statement of the law:\u2014\nIn my view the words \"motion for a new trial,\" in section 70, should be read as meaning \"motion for a new trial only\" and not as including cases in which the motion is substantially for other relief and only as an alternative for a new trial;\nand, in that case, the court having decided unanimously that a motion for judgment non obstante veredicto could not succeed, but that, on the ground of misdirection, a new trial should be granted pursuant to the alternative claim in the appellant's motion in the court below, for the reason mentioned in the above quotation from the judgment of my brother Anglin, held that the appeal was not an appeal from a judgment on a motion for a new trial and that section 70 had, therefore, no application.\nThe second objection was suggested from the bench\u2014an objection of which I desire to speak with the greatest respect because it has the support of the opinion of my brother Idington expressed in his judg- ment in Champion v. The World Building Co.[5], at page 386. The objection arises in this way: The jurisdiction of this court to entertain an appeal such as this, where the action out of which the appeal arises did not originate in a superior court, rests upon section 37, sub-sectionb, of the \"Supreme Court Act\" which provides that in such a case, in the provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, British Columbia and Prince Edward Island, this court shall possess jurisdiction to entertain an appeal from any final judgment of the highest court of final resort where-\nthe sum or value of the matter in dispute amounts to two hundred and fifty dollars or upwards, and in which the court of first instance possesses concurrent jurisdiction with a superior court.\nThe point made against the appeal is that the jurisdiction of the County Court of Vancouver to entertain the plaintiff's action was not a jurisdiction that satisfied the condition.\nthe court of first instance possesses concurrent jurisdiction with a superior court.\nWere it not for the difference of opinion among the members of this court I should have said that the objection was demonstrably untenable. The jurisdiction of the County Court to entertain the plaintiff's action is given by section 30 of the \"County Courts Act,\" sub-sec. 1, and the powers the County Court possessed in exercising that jurisdiction are set forth in section 22. These provisions are as follows:\u2014\nSec. 22.\u2014Every county court shall, as regards all causes of action within its jurisdiction for the time being, have power to grant and shall grant in any proceeding before such court such relief, redress, or remedy, or combination of remedies, either absolute or conditional, and shall in every such proceeding give such and the like effect to every ground of defence or counterclaim; equitable or legal (subject to the provision next hereinafter contained), in as full and ample a manner as might and ought to be done in the like case by the Supreme Court. 1905, ch. 14, sec. 22.\nSec. 30, sub-sec. 1.\u2014In all personal actions where the debt, demand, or damages claimed do not exceed one thousand dollars.\nWithin the natural meaning of the words \"concurrent jurisdiction\" clearly the jurisdiction of the County Court in respect of actions coming within section 30, sub-sec. 1, is \"concurrent\" with that of the Supreme Court. It is said, however, that in applying section 37, sub-sec. b, to British Columbia a restricted meaning must be attached to the phrase \"concurrent jurisdiction;\" that the classes of actions falling within the description contained in sub-sec. b must be limited to actions brought before the County Court under the authority of section 40 of the \"County Courts Act\" which establishes and defines the equitable jurisdiction of county courts and in which this language appears:\u2014\nThe said county courts shall also respectively have and exercise, concurrently with the Supreme Court, all power and authority of the Supreme Court in the actions or matters hereinafter mentioned.\nA good many reasons could be adduced to shew the fallacy of this line of argument but I shall limit myself to two. First. The provisions of the Act relating to the jurisdiction conferred by section 30 are as apt and sufficient to shew that the jurisdiction thus conferred is \"concurrent\" with the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court as is the language quoted in section 40 although in the first mentioned provisions the word \"concurrent\" itself is not employed.\nSecondly. The underlying assumption of the argument is that sub-section b of section 37 of the \"Supreme Court Act,\" in its application to appeals from British Columbia, must be governed in the interpretation of it by reference to the British Columbia legislation touching the jurisdiction of the county courts, in other words, that sub-section b, as regards such application, was framed with a view to such provisions. If that be the assumption upon which sub-section b is to be read, it is sufficiently obvious that, consistently with the supposition that the legislature was not actuated by the merest caprice, the argument cannot be sustained. That is so, for this reason\u2014which would occur immediately to persons familiar with the operation of the county court jurisdiction in British Columbia. By far the most important jurisdiction of the county courts in many respects is what is known as the \"mining jurisdiction,\" \"Mineral Act,\" R.S.B.C., 1911, ch. 151, sec. 140; \"Placer Mining Act,\" R.S.B.C., 1911, ch. 165, sec. 154. The county court by virtue of the provisions of the \"Mineral Act\" and the \"Placer Mining Act\" has \"all the jurisdiction and powers of a court of law and equity\" in a great variety of actions in respect of subjects touching mines, the business of mining, water\u2014rights relating to mining, including among other things personal actions where the debt or damages claimed arise directly out of the business of mining, suits for foreclosure or redemption in relation to mining property, actions of ejectment or trespass in relation to such property, actions between employers and employees, actions for supplies to persons and companies engaged in mining, in all cases without limitation as regards amount or value. It is, of course, inconceivable, or perhaps one should say hardly conceivable, that any legislature dealing with the subject of appeals to this court arising out of actions in county courts in British Columbia should have deliberately enacted, or in its enactments have intentionally used language having the effect that the jurisdiction in appeal of this court should be limited to appeals aris- ing out of actions of the classes enumerated in section 40 of the \"County Courts Act\" (where, speaking generally, the amount or the value of the thing involved is limited to $2,500), thereby denying the right of appeal to suitors in the \"mining jurisdiction\" of the county court in cases involving tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars. Yet such is, beyond question, the intention that must be attributed to the Dominion Parliament in enacting section 37b in so far as it relates to British Columbia in order to sustain the objection I am discussing.\nThe motion should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014Although by his notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia the plaintiff nominally asked for an order directing judgment to be entered in his favour, or in the alternative remitting the action to the County Court to have damages assessed, the action, having been dismissed at the close of the plaintiff's case and without any evidence for the defence having been heard, practically the only relief open was a new trial. Substantially the plaintiff's motion to the Court of Appeal was for a new trial only, and the judgment of the Court of Appeal should, in my opinion, be regarded as a judgment upon a motion for a new trial within the meaning of that phrase in section 70 of the \"Supreme Court Act.\" The notice prescribed by section 70 not having been given, I think the appeal should, on this ground, be dismissed.\nThis disposition of the motion is quite consistent with the decisions in Sedgewick v. Montreal Light, Heat and Power Co.[6], and Jones v. Toronto and York Radial Railway Co. [7], p. 432. I adhere to the view which I expressed in Champion v. The World Building Co.[8] as to the construction of section 37b of the \"Supreme Court Act.\"\nAppeal quashed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Bird, Macdonald & Ross.\nSolicitors for respondents: McPhillips & Smith.\n[1] 50 Can.

Adams (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1916: November 16; 1916: December 11.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Idington, Duff, Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ONTARIO.\nAppeal\u2014Amount in controversy\u2014Joinder of defendants\u2014Separate contracts.\nA., by order of a master, was allowed to prosecute one action against three insurance companies on three separate policies and obtained from the Appellate Division judgment against each for an amount less than $1,000 though the amounts in the aggregate exceeded that sum.\nHeld, following Bennett v. Havelock Electric Light Co. (46 Can. S.C.R. 640) that the defendants were in the same position as if a separate action had been brought against each and as none of them was made liable for a sum exceeding $1,000 no appeal would lie to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nMOTION to quash an appeal from the decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario reversing the judgment at the trial by which the plaintiff\u2019s action was dismissed.\nRespondent\u2019s counsel claimed that the Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal as under the circumstances, which are stated in the headnote, there was no sum exceeding $1,000 in controversy.\nW.L. Scott for the motion referred to Bennett v. Havelock Electric Light Co.[1]; Stephens v. Gerth[2]; Bain v. Anderson & Co.[3] Leighton McCarthy K.C. contra cited Robinson, Little & Co. v. Scott & Son.[4]\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I concur in the opinion of Mr. Justice Anglin.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014I am unable to distinguish this case from that presented in the case of Bennett v. Havelock Electric Light Co.[5], in relation to the right to appeal and therefore think following that decision the motion to quash must prevail with costs.\nDUFF J. concurred in the judgment quashing the appeal.\nANGLIN J.\u2014Under the judgment of the Appellate Division the plaintiff has recovered against three defendants sued in one action upon independent claims arising out of three separate contracts for amounts each individually less than $1,000 but in the aggregate exceeding that sum. He had been allowed by order of the master in chambers, presumably in order to save expense, to proceed with this single action,\nsetting out the separate amounts claimed * * * as against each defendant respectively,\ninstead of being obliged to discontinue it and commence a separate action against each defendant upon its own contract and then have the three actions consolidated. It was stated at bar that this order was made in the exercise of power conferred by R.S.O., 1914, c. 183, s. 158, s.-s. 1. But that provision would appear not to extend to actions brought upon separate and unconnected policies\u2014it deals with\nseveral actions brought for the recovery of money payable under a contract of insurance.\nProbably the order was made under the more com- prehensive terms of the Ontario Consolidated Rule 320. The plaintiff was afterwards allowed to prosecute a single appeal from the judgment at the trial to the Appellate Division, and the judgment of that court allows \u201cthe plaintiff\u2019s said appeal.\u201d\nThese facts, in my opinion, do not give jurisdiction to this court to entertain the proposed appeals of the defendants. The recovery against each defendant is for a sum less than $1,000 and is upon a contract on which that defendant alone is liable. The appeal of each defendant is only against the judgment affecting it. It has no concern in the contract or liability of either of the other defendants. Though for convenience their appeals would, no doubt, be heard together, and probably upon a single appeal case, the appeal of each defendant is nevertheless a distinct and separate appeal in which the matter in controversy is its own liability and nothing else. I think the motion to quash must prevail. Bennett v. Havelock Electric Light Co.[6] is a decision in point. Indeed, in that case the liability of the several defendants arose out of a single transaction and it was even contended that as directors, guilty of misfeasance their liability was joint and several. Nevertheless an attempted joint appeal to this court was quashed, the judgment of the Court of Appeal (reversing, as in this case, that of the trial judge dismissing the action) having held each defendant liable only for $1,000 and costs. If there was not jurisdiction in that case there certainly cannot be in this.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014I am unable to distinguish this case from the case of Bennett v. Havelock Electric Light. Co.6, which was decided by this court on the 22nd February, 1912, and which is mentioned in Cameron\u2019s Second Edition, p. 278.\nIn that case of Bennett[7] an action had been instituted against several defendants as directors of the company respondent, asking that they be condemned to pay an amount of $4,700 being the amount of alleged secret and dishonest profits. The Divisional Court had ordered that the plaintiffs could recover against each of the defendants the sum of $1,000.\nIn the present case the insurance companies, defendants, were sued by virtue of different contracts for an alleged loss of the premises insured. The companies were allowed to plead separately and the cases were tried as one case in order to reduce the cost of \u201cenqu\u00eate\u201d under the provisions of article 158 of chap. 183 R.S.O. The amount to which each company was condemned was below $1,000.\nWhat we should consider in this case in order to determine the jurisdiction in question is not the aggregate amount for which the respondents were sought to be made liable, but the position is the same as if proceedings had been taken separately against each of the defendants.\nI have come to the conclusion that under the provisions of section 48, sub-section (c), the matter in controversy in the appeal does not exceed for each of the defendants the sum of $1,000, and that we have no jurisdiction.\nThe motion to quash should be granted.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\nSolicitors for the the appellants: McCarthy, Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt.\nSolicitors for the respondent: McGaughey & McGaughey.\n[1] 46 Can.

The policy as issued stated that the insurance would expire at noon on Sept. 7th, and insured against the death of the stallion, after premium paid and policy delivered, from accident or disease \u201coccurring or contracted after the commencement of the company\u2019s liability.\u201d The policy was delivered and premium paid before four o\u2019clock p.m. of 8th June; the horse had become sick early that morning and died before six o\u2019clock p.m.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Appellate Division (37 Ont. L.R. 344), that the statement in the application \u201cterm 3 mos.\u201d coupled with that in the policy \u201cdate of expiry 7th Sept.\u201d did not override the express provision as to commencement of liability and make the risk attach from noon of June 7th; that the liability did not commence until the policy was delivered on June 8th; and as the horse died of an illness contracted before such delivery S. could not recover.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThis action is on a policy of insurance dated the 7th day of June, 1915, insuring the appellant against death from accident or disease, during the currency of the policy, of a bay stallion named \u201cLuron.\u201d\nThe application for the insurance is dated 29th May, 1915, and was for a \u201cClass or Section No. One, Stallions all breeds for season of 3 months.\u201d The application also states \u201cTerm 3 mos., Expiry 7-9-16\u201d being the 7th of September, 1916. In response to this application the policy was issued by the respondents, dated the 7th of June, 1915, which, as stated on its face, expired on the 7th of September, 1915, at noon. The premium charged, $32.50, was at the high rate of $3.25 upon each $100 for three months. This policy was sent by the respondents from its head office at Montreal to its agent in Petrolia on the 7th of June, 1915, the date it bears and was delivered on that date to the appellant and the premium collected.\nThe stallion was in perfect health at noon of the 7th of June when the appellant says that the policy went into force, but was taken ill on the 8th of June and died after the delivery of the policy and payment of the premium.\nThe respondents\u2019 contention and the judgment of the Appellate Division was based upon the following provision in the policy:\u2014\nNow this policy witnesseth, that if after receipt hereof and payment by the Insured to the Company of the under noted premium for an insurance up to noon on the date of expiry of this policy any animal described in the Schedule below, shall during that period die from any accident or disease hereby insured against as after mentioned and occurring or contracted after the commencement of the Company\u2019s liability hereunder, and otherwise defined in the aforesaid proposal the Company shall be liable to pay to the insured, after receipt of proof satisfactory to the Directors, two-thirds of the loss which the said insured shall so suffer, but pro rata only with other existing insurance or sums recoverable from other parties and not exceeding the amount for which such animal is insured.\nSir George C. Gibbons K.C. for the appellant re- ferred to May on Insurance (4 ed.), sec. 400, p. 918; Hallock v. Commercial Ins. Co.[2], at page 275.\nG.F. Macdonnell and Oscar H. King for the respondents cited Canning v. Farquhar[3], at pages 731-2, contending that appellant should have disclosed the horse\u2019s condition when paying the premium. There was an alteration in the risk which avoided the policy.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I find myself obliged though with great reluctance to concur in dismissing this appeal.\nThe proposal was for an insurance for the season against the death of a stallion from accident or disease and I cannot see what right the respondent company had to insert without notice the provision in the policy limiting the liability to death from accident or disease occurring or contracted after the commencement of the company\u2019s liability. The provision was of great importance involving, of course, in this case the whole liability under the insurance.\nIn the proposal the appellant declared, as was no doubt the fact, that the horse was then in perfect health, and it was examined and reported on by the inspecting veterinarian on behalf of the company. The policy was issued within ten days after. Counsel for the respondent said that this provision was the only way in which live stock insurance companies could protect themselves. I cannot in the least understand what he meant. There is no reason why they should not insure in accordance with their own form of proposal against death from disease whenever contracted, whilst the risk of disease being contracted during the few days elapsing between the dates of the proposal and the policy would hardly, one may suppose, have been sufficient to deter them from accepting the insurance. Of course they were at liberty to make this or any other stipulation they pleased provided they did so in a proper manner and with due notice to the insured. What they were not at liberty to do was to accept the proposal, declare it to be the basis of the policy and then surreptitiously introduce a limitation of their liability and deliver the policy leaving the insured to suppose she had such an insurance as she applied for. It is precisely to guard against such practices that the \u201cInsurance Act\u201d (R.S.O. ch. 183) by the 8th Statutory Condition in section 194 provides:\u2014\n8. After application for insurance it shall be deemed that any policy sent to the assured is intended to be in accordance with the terms of the application, unless the company points out in writing the particulars wherein the policy differs from the application.\nThis may have been done; the company should have had an opportunity to prove it.\nUnfortunately the appellant has not raised this point and since it is not pleaded this court cannot give any effect to it.\nThe appeal must therefore be dismissed.\nDAVIES J.\u2014The real substantive question in dispute here is the exact time when \u201cthe liability of the company commenced\u201d under the policy. Sir George Gibbons contended strongly that it began at noon on the date of the execution of the policy by the company, 7th June, and that as the sickness and death of the stallion insured happened after that date the company was liable to pay. The Court of Appeal, on the contrary, held that, on the true construction of the policy itself, the company\u2019s liability did not commence until after delivery and acceptance of the policy and that as at that time, on the 8th June, the horse was \u201csick unto death\u201d and actually died within a few hours afterwards, no liability on the part of the company attached.\nThe language of the policy reads as follows:\u2014\nIf after receipt hereof and payment by the insured to the Company of the undernoted premium for an insurance up to noon on the date of expiry of this policy, any animal described in the schedule below, shall during that period die from any accident or disease hereby insured against as after mentioned, and occurring or contracted after the commencement of the Company\u2019s liability hereunder, and otherwise defined in the aforesaid proposal the Company shall be liable to pay * * *.\nThe date of the expiry of the policy was stated in the policy as the 7th September, 1915. Sir George contended that although no specified term was mentioned in the policy itself, the proposal or application made by the plaintiff had written on its margin by the plaintiff\u2019s agent in pencil the words \u201cterm 3 months\u201d and that as the expiry of the policy was definitely fixed as the 7th September in the policy, it must be construed once it came into operation as covering the whole period of three months and definitely fixing the commencement of defendants\u2019 liability as arising on the 7th June. But while the insurance statute, ch. 183, R.S.O., in its 156th section, enacts\u2014\nthat the proposal or application of the assured shall not as against him be deemed a part of or be considered the contract of insurance\n(except in a case not arising here) it is manifest that if the plaintiff himself invokes the terms of that proposal or application as definitely fixing the time from which the policy was to run, the court must look at the whole of that document and not at a part only. So looking, we find the application, which was dated 29th May, expressly providing:\u2014\nThe Company\u2019s liability commences after payment of the premium and receipt of policy or protection note by the insured. In this case there was no protection note and the plaintiff did not receive her policy or pay her premium until the afternoon of the 8th June. The horse died a few hours after such delivery, of a disease which it had contracted before such delivery, and if the application can under the circumstances I mention be referred to, it would conclusively settle when the company\u2019s liability commenced.\nApart from that, however, I concur with the reasons given by the judges of the Appellate Division that the language of the policy itself apart from the application settles the question. I have already quoted it.\nAs I construe that language, it covers insurance not for a period of three months but for such period from a time after delivery to and receipt by the insured of the policy up to the date of its expiry. No question arises as to this time of delivery. The insurance covers the period between those dates and the date the policy expires. The death of the animal must occur during that period, from a disease occurring or contracted after the commencement of the company\u2019s liability, and that liability, I hold under the words of the policy, did not commence until the delivery of the policy.\nI would therefore dismiss the appeal.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The appellant sues upon a policy of insurance issued by respondent, insuring her against loss by death of a stallion from accident or disease.\nThe operative covenant sued upon is as follows:\u2014\nNow THIS POLICY WITNESSETH, that if after receipt hereof and payment by the insured to the company of the undernoted premium for an insurance up to noon on the date of the expiry of this policy, any animal described in the schedule below, shall during that period die from any accident or disease hereby insured against as after mentioned, and occurring or contracted after the commencement of the company\u2019s liability hereunder, and otherwise defined in the aforesaid proposal the company shall be liable to pay to the insured, after receipt of proof satisfactory to the directors, two-thirds of the loss which the said insured shall so suffer, but pro rat\u00e2 only with other existing insurance or sums recoverable from other parties and not exceeding the amount for which such animal is insured.\nThe stallion died from a disease clearly contracted before the payment of the premium and before the delivery of the policy.\nI am unable to expand the tolerably clear and explicit terms of this covenant whereby its operation is directed to something happening after its receipt and the payment of the premium, to cover a death which did not result from a disease contracted after the commencement of the company\u2019s liability thereunder, but from a disease contracted before the commencement of such liability.\nThe argument that the premium was obviously to cover three months and that as the policy was to expire on a day named which would make the policy operate retroactively a day or more before the time when its very clear terms indicate that it was the intention of the contracting parties that it should only begin to run after both the delivery of the policy and payment of the premium, seems clearly untenable.\nThe same line of argument, if maintained, might render the company liable to pay in case of the death of an animal weeks before the delivery of the policy or payment of the premium, which might well happen if the animal were at a long distance from the insured and insurer.\nSuch policies might exist and be effective as in analogous cases in marine insurance.\nIt all depends on the frame of the contract.\nIt is idle to rely upon dicta from authors or judges in relation to contracts in a form that lent another possible meaning than that which can fairly be put upon this one. As I read this contract it does not offend in its operative part against the clauses in the \u201cInsurance Act\u201d relied on by counsel for the appellant.\nThe recital, however, in this policy, I may be permitted to suggest, is not what I could rely upon as a compliance with section 156 of the \u201cInsurance Act.\u201d\nIndeed I think it unjustifiable but I cannot in this case see how I can, save by discarding it, give any effect to the section.\nIf we tried to go further, as invited by the argument of counsel, in the way of applying sub\u2011section 1 of section 156, we could only destroy the contract but would be unable to construct another unless by unduly straining that clearly intended by the language used.\nIf, for example, the policy had been delivered, then even without payment, we might have an arguable case presented by virtue of sub-section 1 of section 159, whereby to set up or make operative the contract so amended by that sub-section. I pass no opinion thereon\u2014indeed have none\u2014and am merely trying to illustrate what may, by virtue of the statute, be possible, but here is impossible.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014The language of the policy does not appear to admit of more than one construction; and one of the conditions of responsibility laid down is that the \u201caccident or disease\u201d shall occur or be contracted after the commencement of the \u201ccompany\u2019s liability\u201d under the policy and the \u201ccompany\u2019s liability\u201d does not commence before the payment of the premium. \u201cOtherwise defined in the aforesaid proposal\u201d upon which counsel for the appellant to some extent relies, is an adjective clause qualifying \u201caccident or disease.\u201d In the contract now before us there is apparently no subject-matter to which these words can apply; but the form is a general form and the words might find their application where risks insured against fall within table four, and they are no doubt also intended to provide for special cases to which the form does not itself in terms refer.\nANGLIN J.\u2014In view of the explicit directions of sub-section 1 of sec. 156 and of sub-section 1 of section 193 of the \u201cInsurance Act\u201d (R.S.O. 1914, ch. 164) and of the express prohibition of the sub-section 3 of the former section I am, with the appellant, unable to understand the reference of the learned Chief Justice of the Common Pleas to the proposal or application made by the assured for the purpose of defining the term of the contract of insurance sued upon, or for that of interpreting the phrase, \u201ccommencement of the company\u2019s liability\u201d used in the policy. With respect, I am of the opinion that, under the statutory provisions above cited, the term of the insurance must, as against the insured at all events, be found in the language of the policy itself unaided by anything in the application or proposal for insurance. That, I think, is the clear effect of the legislation to which I have referred. Although the insured is not debarred from invoking the application in so far as he can derive aid therefrom in other respects, inasmuch as the statute by sub-section 1 of section 193 (made applicable by section 235) requires that \u201cthe term of the insurance\u201d shall appear on the face of the policy, I doubt whether even he can invoke the application to extend the term as stated in the policy.\nWith the other learned judges of the Appellate Division I find it unnecessary to resort at all to the application in order to ascertain the beginning of the term of the insurance. With them I find the beginning of that term fixed in the policy as to the occurrence of death to be the time of the receipt of the policy and payment of premium, and as to the accident or disease occasioning the death to be\u2014\nthe commencement of the company\u2019s liability hereunder,\ni.e., under the policy. Sir George Gibbons argued that the use of these two distinct phrases indicates that \u201cthe commencement of liability\u201d was meant to describe a moment of time different from and necessarily earlier than that at which the contract was made by delivery of the policy. Inasmuch as by sec. 159 of the statute the contract of insurance when delivered is\nas binding on the insurer as if the premium had been paid\nand this\nnotwithstanding any agreement, condition or stipulation to the contrary,\nthe risk attached from the moment of the delivery of the policy although the premium was not paid until afterwards. The contention that the use of two distinct descriptive phrases necessarily excludes an intention thereby to refer to the same event proceeds on the assumption that the policy was framed by a skilled draughtsman. A very cursory perusal of the document suffices to dispel any such illusion. Brief as the operative clause is, tautology is perhaps its most striking feature. It is, therefore, not surprising to find in it the same idea expressed\u2014the same thing described\u2014in different language.\nDelivery of the policy took place on the 8th of June, before the death of the animal insured, but after it had contracted the disease which proved fatal. That disease, however, had only manifested itself on the morning of the 8th and the case proceeds on the footing that it was then first contracted. The policy bears date the 7th of June and was certainly executed on or before that day. The date of expiry of the risk is stated on the face of the policy to be the 7th September and in a table of \u201crisks,\u201d likewise printed on the face of the policy, we find the item:\u2014\nStallions as against death from accident or disease during the currency of the policy.\nIt is at least questionable whether the adjectival phrase,\nduring the currency of the policy,\nin this item qualifies the words \u201caccident or disease.\u201d I think it does not, but applies only to the word \u201cdeath.\u201d At all events it should not in the case of disease be read as meaning disease first contracted during the currency of the policy. But I cannot think that this somewhat vague clause can affect the clear and explicit limitation of the risk in the operative provision of the policy to death from a\ndisease contracted after the commencement of the company\u2019s liability hereunder.\nThe question is purely one of interpretation of the latter phrase.\nNow there can be no doubt that there was no liability of the company before the delivery of the policy. Up to that moment there was no contract of insurance. The company might have entirely declined the risk. The applicant might have refused to accept the policy or to pay the premium. By force of the statute liability began upon delivery of the policy, though it should not otherwise have arisen until payment of the premium. Granted that it was possible for the parties to have provided by express stipulation on the face of the policy that the risk should be deemed to have attached before delivery, they have not done so. Sir George Gibbons contended that it sufficiently appears that the premium paid to and accepted by the company was based on a full three months\u2019 risk. I find nothing in the policy to indicate that to be the fact\u2014nothing which justifies a conclusion that upon a basis either of contract or of estoppel the respondent should be held to have undertaken a risk or liability antedating the delivery of the policy. It is true that on the application\u2014not in its body but in a marginal note on the upper left-hand corner\u2014we find the words \u201cTerm 3 Mos.\u201d But, while that is so, we also find in the body of the same document this clause:\u2014\nThe company\u2019s liability commences after payment of the premium and receipt of policy or protection note by the insured.\nIt is this latter clause which is referred to by the learned Chief Justice of the Common Pleas as an aid in determining the limitation of the risk and defining \u201cthe commencement of the company\u2019s liability\u201d as against the insured. While in my opinion it may not be so used on behalf of the insurer, on the other hand if, notwithstanding the explicit requirement of sub\u2011section 1 of section 193 that the term of the insurance shall appear on the face of the policy, the insured may invoke the application in support of his contention that the risk was for a full period of three months (necessarily beginning on the 7th of June since the date of its expiry is fixed as the 7th of September) he must take that document as a whole and cannot escape the effect of its very clear and precise provision fixing the commencement of the risk as, in the absence of a protection note, the time of receipt of the policy. In the light of this provision the marginal note on the application form, \u201cTerm 3 Mos.\u201d, must, I think, be regarded as a classification of the risk rather than as intended to define its precise duration. In this view the 8th statutory condition, which might otherwise, though not invoked by the appellant, present a somewhat formidable difficulty to the respondents (see Laforest v. Factories Ins. Co.[4]), is inapplicable to this marginal note on the application.\nOn the whole case the conclusion reached in the Appellate Division seems to me to be right. The appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014The application for insurance in this case is dated the 29th day of May, 1915, and was a proposal applying to the respondent for insurance on a horse for a sum of one thousand dollars ($1,000).\nIn the body of the application there was a note that the company\u2019s liability would commence after the payment of the premium and the receipt of the policy by the insured.\nNo payment was made by the applicant when the application was signed. The policy was issued by the company in Montreal on the 7th day of June, 1915, and was mailed to their agent in Petrolia, the place of residence of the appellant. It appears that on the morning of the 8th the horse became sick. In the afternoon of the same day the policy was delivered and the premium paid and a few hours after the horse died.\nThe policy contained the following provision:\u2014\nIf after receipt hereof and payment by the insured to the company of the undernoted premium for an insurance up to noon on the date of expiry of this policy, any animal described in the schedule below shall during that period die from any accident or disease hereby insured against as after mentioned, and occurring or contracted after the commencement of the company\u2019s liability hereunder, and otherwise defined in the aforesaid proposal the company shall be liable to pay, etc. When the policy was issued on the 7th of June the horse was in good health; when it was delivered, however, it had become sick and the question is whether the company\u2019s liability began on the date of the policy or when the premium was paid and the policy delivered.\nThe stipulation above quoted shews that there was no liability on the part of the company until the policy was delivered. Then if the sickness existed at the time of the delivery of the policy the company would not be liable because it was formally stated that if the horse dies from a disease contracted before the delivery of the policy there will be no liability. That contract could not in my opinion be construed in any other way.\nIt was contended, however, by Sir George Gibbons in his argument that if the horse died before the delivery of the policy there would be no liability; but if the horse simply took sick before the delivery then, in such a case, the company would be responsible for the amount of insurance.\nI am unable to find any such distinction in the clause above quoted. It seems to me clear that the liability begins at the time of the delivery of the policy and at the time of the payment of the premium and the condition of the policy was that if the horse died before the delivery of the policy or the payment of the premium, or if he died after but from a disease which had been contracted before the delivery of the policy, then in such case the loss would be not for the insurance company but for the owner of the horse.\nIt may be then, as a result of that construction, that the plaintiff was not fully insured for the three months which she contemplated; but we have a declaration in the application itself that the policy would not be in force before it was delivered and before the premium was paid. The appellant was aware of that condition, because it was on the document which she signed.\nI am unable to come to any other conclusion than that the action of the plaintiff was properly dismissed by the Appellate Division and that this appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Moncrieff & Wilson.\nSolicitors for the respondents: King & King.\n[1] 37 Ont.

The respondent, on the ground that the purchase was beyond the powers vested in Arnold, resisted an action of the appellant for the enforcement of the agreement and sued the appellant, by counterclaim, for the reimbursement of the $1,300 so paid, alleging that this sum, which was borrowed by Arnold from the Trust Company, was repaid by Arnold out of his moneys in the hands of Arnold for investments. The trial judge and the Court of Appeal held, and it was not disputed, that Arnold, in entering into the purchase in the name of the respondent, exceeded his authority.\nHeld, Duff J. (dissenting), that the onus' probandi as to the ownership of the moneys, was not on the respondent, and that, even if it was so, the receipt in the agreement of sale and the facts leading up thereto were sufficient proof that the money paid to the appellant was that of the respondent.\nPer Duff J. (dissenting).\u2014Respondent can not repudiate Arnold as his agent for the purchase and at the same time treat him as such in connection with the advances. The receipt in the agreement for sale could only constitute an estoppel in an action based upon the agreement and between the parties to it. On respondent lies the onus of showing that the moneys in question are his moneys; and the admission derived from the receipt in the agreement did not constitute a prima facie case sufficient to shift the burden of proof.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, reversing the judgment of Mac- donald J. at the trial, by which the respondent's counterclaim was dismissed.\nThe material facts of the case are fully stated in the judgments now reported.\nE. L. Newcombe K.C. for the appellant.\nS. S. Taylor K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The late W. R. Arnold who held a power of attorney from the respondent purchased for him and in his name certain lands in British Columbia. The consideration was $11,700 of which $1,700 was paid in cash, the receipt being acknowledged in the agreement for sale, and the balance was to be paid in future instalments. The $1,700 was paid by a cheque of the Dominion Trust Co. of which Arnold was manager and on which he could draw for any money he wanted.\nIt was held and it is not now disputed that the purchase was beyond the powers vested in Arnold and is void. The trial judge, however, refused to order the return to the respondent of the $1,700 paid to the appellant because he was not satisfied that the moneys were the moneys of the respondent; he held that the onus was on the respondent to shew that they were his moneys. I can see no grounds for this decision. The respondent, as he admits, is a man of small education and trusted his affairs entirely to his friend Arnold. He states over and over again that he knew nothing whatever about the transaction; it was useless therefore for the judge to give him, as he says he did, an opportunity of proving that the money was his.\nBut even if the onus was on the respondent, I think that it has been sufficiently discharged. The respondent has proved that some years previously he had placed in Arnold's hands a sum of $1,700 and even if this had been invested there is nothing to shew that Arnold, a man of endless speculations, had not realized the money again. Further there is no doubt that very shortly after making this agreement for purchase Arnold collected and had in his hands many thousand dollars belonging to the respondent.\nI do not know how you can identify any particular moneys of the respondent in the hands of Arnold; men of his type are not very particular about money coming into their hands from whatever sources and I think it is likely that he used either the respondent's, his own or his company's cash very indifferently.\nI cannot see that there is anything in the fact that the appellant was paid by a cheque of the Dominion Trust Co. which will enable him to dispute that the money was received from the respondent, the purchaser named in the deed, as by this writing under seal he admitted was the case.\nThe respondent has lost all his money which he confided to Arnold and the appellant has certainly no claim to the $1,700 beyond the fact that it is in his possession. Under these circumstances one might have supposed that he would have been content to pay it over under the judgment by which, of course, he was fully protected, without bringing the respondent before this court.\nThe judgment should be affirmed and this appeal dismissed with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014A majority of the learned judges of the Court of Appeal drew the inference that the money which is in dispute in this case belonged to Phillip. Though at the close of the argument I entertained some doubts upon the point, subsequent consideration, after reading the evidence, has convinced me that the inference is a reasonable and proper one.\nI have nothing to add to the reasons of Chief Justice Macdonald and would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014I think there was evidence furnished by the receipt in the agreement in question and the facts leading up thereto and surrounding all the transactions in relation thereto from which it should be inferred that the money paid to appellant was that of the respondent which he is entitled to recover when repudiating the onerous contract which he never had authorized. It certainly was not the money of Arnold and could not be claimed honestly by appellant unless it was so which he has failed to establish.\nThe appeal should, therefore, be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J. (dissenting)\u2014The appellant's action was based upon a purported agreement, dated the 1st Nov., 1909, for the sale of land near Vancouver. The instrument was executed by the appellant as vendor and by one W. R. Arnold, who has since died, but was then the manager of the Dominion Trust Co. in the name of the respondent and professedly as the respondent's agent. The appellant claimed judgment against the respondent for the unpaid instalments of the purchase money and, in the event of nonpayment, for foreclosure of the interests of the respondent and certain persons claiming by transfer from him. The respondent denied the authority of Arnold to enter into the agreement on his behalf or in his name and counterclaimed for the restitution to him by the appellant of certain sums amounting in all to $1,300 which he alleged had been paid to the appellant as part of the purchase money, but without authority, out of the moneys in Arnold's possession for him. The trial judge held, and this is a point upon which all parties are agreed, that Arnold had in fact no authority to execute the so called agreement in the name of the respondent and dismissed the action against the respondent. He held also that the respondent had failed to shew any title to the moneys received by the appellant from Arnold and dismissed the counterclaim. In the Court of Appeal Mr. Justice McPhillips concurred with the trial judge in his view that the counterclaim should be dismissed; but the majority of the court, the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Martin, held that the respondent had sufficiently established his title to the moneys claimed and judgment was given accordingly.\nI think the opinion of the learned trial judge and that of Mr. Justice McPhillips is the opinion which ought to prevail; and I think it right to state my reasons in full because the points in controversy are not exclusively points of fact, the decision in favour of the respondent having no unimportant relation to the proper application of one of the leading principles governing the incidence of the burden of proof. The agreement between Arnold and the appellant which the document above mentioned professes to embody was made on the 1st of Nov. when $200 was paid to the appellant on account of purchase money by means of the cheque of the Dominion Trust Co. At that time the respondent's name was not mentioned and nothing appears to have been said to indicate that Arnold himself was not the purchaser. On the 12th Nov., when the residue of the cash payment was due (nominally $1,500, but in reality $1,100, $400 being allowed, as it was said, for a commission to the purchaser) Arnold informed the appellant that he wished the agreement to be taken in the respondent's name and the document on which the appellant's action was brought was produced and executed. The residue ($1,100) was also paid by means of the cheque of the Dominion Trust Co. These sums of $200 and $1,100 paid in the manner mentioned were treated by the Dominion Trust Co., as in fact they were, as advances for the purpose of the purchase. The respondent had a personal account with the Trust Co. but the moneys advanced were not charged to him in this account; nor was he there charged with the Trust Co's share (1\/2) of the sum allowed the purchaser as commission (so called) which would have been $200. The only entries in the Trust Co.'s books relating to the transaction are to be found in a book known as the \"real estate ledger\" in which there is a description of the transaction, the appellant being entered as vendor and the respondent as purchaser and in which the sums advanced on Nov. 1st and Nov. 12th are entered as debits against the transaction as well as the repayment of these advances on July 12th, 1910, which is entered as a credit. This latter payment was made by Arnold, a receipt being given to him as for money paid by him personally and not in the character of agent. In the meantime, in April, 1910, Arnold, professing to act under his power of attorney from Phillip, had transferred the agreement to himself. Subsequently Arnold sold certain undivided interests receiving therefor shares in the capital stock of a certain company. These shares were taken in his name and treated as his own property.\nArnold was an old friend of the respondent's and in 1904 and 1905 had received some money from him for investment which had then been invested. He seems to have acted as the respondent's agent in vari- ous ways and the respondent seems to have trusted him implicitly, not asking for accounts, and in fact the only account he received appears to have been one rendered in 1912. This account did not treat the property in question as a property held for Phillip. His power of attorney admittedly did not confer authority to pledge the respondent's credit in purchasing land or in borrowing money. There is no direct evidence and there is no fact pointing to the conclusion that Arnold had any funds of the respondent's in his possession either at the time the purchase was made or at the time the advances were repaid in July, 1910. The respondent, it may be added, did not become aware of this purchase or of the advances until after Arnold's death and some little time before the appellant's action was brought.\nThe respondent's counsel rightly assumed that he could make no progress towards establishing his claim without first satisfying the tribunal of the fact that there were sufficient grounds for judicially inferring either (1) that in taking over the agreement in April, 1910, and in repaying in July, 1910, the advances of Nov., 1909, as well as in procuring these advances to be made Arnold was acting as the agent of the respondent or (2) that in point of fact the advances were repaid out of moneys belonging to the respondent in his possession. There is no evidence to support either of these propositions, and it will be clear enough I think, from the considerations I shall briefly mention, that the preponderance of probability to be derived from the facts in evidence is against both of them. It will be sufficiently clear also that even assuming the first proposition to be established in fact that proposition can lead us nowhere in view of the circumstance that the respondent's case made upon his counterclaim and in his defence is wholly based upon the repudiation of Arnold's authority to act as his agent; and, as to the second proposition, assuming it established, it is hardly doubtful that it would afford no ground for relief to the respondent as against the appellant.\nBefore proceeding to discuss these propositions in detail it is well to emphasize the fact already mentioned that the moneys in question were paid by the Dominion Trust Co. and that the payment was treated by the Trust Co. and by Arnold as an advance for the purpose of the purchase and that, eight months afterwards, this advance was repaid by Arnold. The fact that these moneys were advanced and the advance was running for a period of eight months is conclusive against any suggestion that the sums in question were paid out of moneys in the Trust Co.'s possession for the respondent or out of moneys at the time in Arnold's possession for him, the advance having been made, as already mentioned, in the form of a payment direct from the Trust Co. to the appellant. The respondent can therefore successfully contend that these moneys were his moneys only on one of two assumptions; first, that the advance was an advance to Arnold as the respondent's agent; or, secondly, that the payment was a payment by the Dominion Trust Co. acting as the respondent's agent, which latter assumption could only be supported upon the theory that the Trust Co. had been employed to act as the agent of the respondent in making the advance by Arnold acting as his agent. Admittedly there was no communication between the respondent and the Trust Co. with regard to this particular transaction and the Trust Co. had not been empowered by the respondent himself directly to act for him in such transactions generally.\nThis brings us to the first of the above mentioned propositions put forward on behalf of the respondent. There is one circumstance which can be urged in support of the theory that Arnold in procuring the advance to be made by the Trust Co. professed to act for the respondent, that is the fact that the purchase was made in the respondent's name and that in the real estate ledger of the Trust Company the transaction was entered as being, that which it appeared to be on its face, a purchase by the respondent. As against this theory, on the other hand, there are all the circumstances which seem to indicate that Arnold was merely using Phillip's name as a convenience in a transaction which in reality was, and was intended to be, his own.\nThese circumstances include the fact, according to the appellant's testimony which the learned trial judge seems to have accepted, that Arnold approached the appellant in the guise of being himself the purchaser but taking the purchase in Phillip's name for his own convenience; they include also the facts that no notice was given to Phillip that Arnold was pledging his credit for large deferred payments; that the agreement was afterwards taken over by Arnold without notice to Phillip; that the advances were repaid in a manner which indicated that he treated them as advances to himself personally; that he treated the property as his own making no reference to it or to the proceeds of the sale of an interest in it in the subsequent account rendered to the respondent. These circumstances all point to an intention on the part of Arnold not to throw the burden of the purchase on Phillip, but rather to use Phillip's name in a transaction which was his own and the burden of which he intended to carry.\nThere is the additional circumstance already mentioned that the respondent had a personal account with the Trust Company and that in this account no mention is made either of the advances or of the sum of $200.00 (commission) which the Trust Company was entitled to charge against the real purchaser. Add to these the circumstances that Arnold in fact had no authority to borrow money from the Trust Company on behalf of Phillip and that as between the Trust Company and himself he treated the loan as his own (see receipt of July 21st, 1910) and it seems sufficiently clear that the weight of evidence is distinctly in favour of the view that the advance was not procured by Arnold intending to act as the respondent's agent and was not made by the Trust Company intending to act as the respondent's agent at Arnold's request.\nIf indeed it could have been shewn, either by direct evidence or through a well founded inference, that the advance was in fact repaid out of the moneys in Arnold's possession on behalf of the respondent, then a different colour would be given to the whole business and it would not then, I think, have been open to Arnold to say as against the respondent that he had not acted for the respondent in all these dealings with the Trust Company as well as with the appellant and it would have been open to the respondent to adopt these dealings as his own. But in truth, as I have already said, there is no direct evidence and there is no fact which indicates that Arnold at any time in the course of these transactions had funds of the respondent's in his possession, still less that the advances were repaid out of any such moneys. The suggestion that this was so cannot be put in any higher category than mere guesswork; as against it there are all the circumstances above mentioned indicating that Arnold was merely using the respondent's name as a convenience, in which case the use of the respondent's money for the repayment of the advances could only be classed as intentional misappropriation. But with respect to all these theories as grounds for supporting the respondent's claim, the respondent is in hopeless difficulties by reason of the position he is obliged to take up as the very foundation of his claim. The respondent now repudiates the authority of Arnold to enter into the purchase on his behalf or in his name. Arnold, as already mentioned, was equally without authority either to enter into the purchase or to procure advances on behalf of the respondent; and it is impossible to draw a line between the purchase and the arrangement resulting in the advances in such a way as to enable the respondent at one and the same time to repudiate the purchase and to adopt as his own act the act of Arnold in procuring the Trust. Company to make the payments. As against Arnold it could not be done and therefore as against the appellant, with whom Arnold was professing to deal in the respondent's name with the respondent's authority, it cannot be done. The respondent, by repudiating Arnold's authority to pledge his credit in respect of the purchase (thereby escaping all responsibility to the appellant under the professed agreement), has incapacitated himself from alleging as a ground of his claim against the appellant that the moneys in question were borrowed by Arnold for him and that they became in consequence his moneys in the appellant's hands.\nThe respondent cannot insist upon adopting any one of Arnold's acts from that by which he procured the advances to that of repaying the advances without treating Arnold as his agent for making the purchase.\nFrom all this it is quite evident that even if the respondent had been able to shew that Arnold had used his funds in July, 1910, in repaying the Trust Company the respondent would still have one or more difficult bridges to cross before making good his claim against the appellant. The root of the difficulty is that the respondent's position in repudiating Arnold's authority and the Trust Co.'s authority to make payments for him, that is to say, in his behalf, necessarily separates any misappropriation by Arnold of his funds for the purposes of the transaction from the transaction itself and he could only make good his claim to moneys of his misappropriated by Arnold as far as he could trace these moneys (if in fact such moneys had passed into the hands of the Trust Company). He might have remedy against the Trust Company but he cannot trace his moneys further. It was not his funds, but the Trust Company's funds which went to pay the appellant. He cannot allege that the Trust Company paid out his moneys eight months before it received them because he has repudiated any authority on the part of the Trust Company to act for him in making payments. Whether or not the Trust Company in such circumstances might have had a claim against the appellant would be a profitless inquiry for many reasons, the most conclusive for the present being that the whole discussion is hypothetical, there being as already said nothing to indicate that the Trust Company was repaid out of the respondent's moneys, and much to indicate the contrary.\nOn behalf of the respondent the judgment below is supported on two other grounds. The first is the ground upon which the Chief Justice in the court below proceeded, namely, that the agreement of the first of November, 1909, contains a statement in the following words:\u2014\nThe sum of $1,700 (Seventeen Hundred Dollars) on the execution of this agreement, the receipt whereof the vendor doth hereby admit and acknowledge,\u2014 and that this constitutes an admission by the appellant who executed the agreement of the receipt of the sum in question for the respondent. This admission is said to constitute a prim\u00e2 facie case in favour of the respondent and as the learned Chief Justice puts it in his judgment, it is said that there are no other facts in evidence which \"displace\" this prim\u00e2 facie case. There are two reasons which force me to reject this line of reasoning:\u2014First, the statement of fact upon which it is based could only constitute an estoppel in an action between the parties to the agreement and based upon it. The respondent's counterclaim is not an action based upon the agreement, it is an action in repudiation of the agreement. Then if this so called admission is to be treated as a piece of evidence simply it must be construed and weighed for the purpose of appraising its value with reference to the circumstances in which it is said to have been made. It is not at all a point in controversy that the appellant, in executing the agreement, acted on the representation made to him by Arnold that Arnold had the respondent's authority for using his name. What then does this statement, which, be it observed, is not a statement that the appellant has received the sum mentioned from the respondent, amount to? Neither expressly nor by implication can it be read as a declaration of anything more than this\u2014that in a transaction in which Arnold professes with the respondent's authority to be using the respondent's name as purchaser, the appellant as vendor has received a certain sum as part of the purchase money. The so called admission in other words does not carry us a step beyond the fact that Arnold did profess to have authority to enter into the transaction and to make these payments, in the name of the respondent. The so called admission then being an admission only of certain undisputed facts is not of the least assistance to us. The second reason is this:\u2014The so called admission being nothing but a piece of evidence, it does not shift the burden of proof as determined by the pleadings, which cast on the respondent (plaintiff by counterclaim) the onus of shewing that the moneys in question are his moneys. An admission may, of course, without shifting the burden of proof in that sense, constitute a prim\u00e2 facie case and thereby shift the burden of proof in the other sense, namely, the burden of going on with the evidence, with the consequence that if the defendant fails to give further evidence judgment may be given to the plaintiff. In the case before us the so called admission in itself could not constitute a prim\u00e2 facie case for the respondent (plaintiff by counterclaim) and shift the onus in this last mentioned sense. That is so for the simple reason that the very document containing the admission taken by itself alone, instead of establishing the respondent's right to recover the money back from the appellant, would have established the appellant's right not only to retain the money paid but to hold the respondent for the still unpaid purchase money. But, assuming a prim\u00e2 facie case to be established, it is quite a misconception to suppose that (except in special cases where, for example, the facts proved give rise to a presumption of law in the plaintiff's favour) the effect of a prim\u00e2 facie case is to cast upon the defendant the burden of disproving the plaintiff's allegation of fact in the sense of negativing that allegation by a preponderance of evidence in favour of the defendant. The real effect, as I have indicated above, is that if further evidence is not given the plaintiff is entitled to judgment; if further evidence is given, whether by the plaintiff or the defendant, then the evidence being complete, the plaintiff must fail unless the evidence as a whole is sufficient to establish the allegation of fact upon which his case depends. The burden of establishing remains on him to the end and if at the end the scales are even, he must fail. The matter is stated very succinctly by Lord Esher in the following passage from his judgment in Abrath v. The North Eastern Railway Co.[1] .\nIt is contended (I think fallaciously) that if the plaintiff has given prim\u00e2 facie evidence, which unless it be answered, will entitle him to have the question decided in his favour, the burden of proof is shifted on to the defendant as to the decision of the questian itself. . .It seems to me that the proposition ought to be stated thus:\u2014the plaintiff may give prim\u00e2 facie evidence which, unless it be answered either by contradictory evidence or by the evidence of additional facts, ought to lead the jury to find the question in his favour; the defendant may give evidence, either by contradicting the plaintiff's evidence or by proving other facts; the jury have to consider upon the evidence given upon both sides, whether they are satisfied in favour of the plaintiff with respect to the question which he calls upon them to answer. . . Then comes this difficulty\u2014suppose that the jury, after considering the evidence, are left in real doubt as to which way they are to answer the question put to them on behalf of the plaintiff; in that case also the burden of proof lies upon the plaintiff, and if the defendant has been able by the additional facts which he has adduced to bring the minds of the whole jury to a state of doubt, the plaintiff has failed to satisfy the burden of proof which lies upon him.\nTaking all the facts before us as a whole, the preponderance appears to be rather in favour of the appellant (defendant by counterclaim).\nThe second ground upon which the respondent relies is the fact that the Dominion Trust Company, the executor of Arnold, both as executor and personally, disclaims in its pleading any interest in the moneys in question. The respondent founds upon this fact the argument that the moneys were not provided by Arnold himself and it follows, he contends, that they must have been taken from the funds in Arnold's hands for him. This argument is not wanting in audacity although as a ground supporting the judgment below it seems to be lacking in everything else. It is an extraordinary proposition that the disclaimer by Arnold's executor of any interest in these moneys should in itself be considered to establish as against the appellant, who, of course, is no way responsible for the pleading of any fact of any description whatever. If there was any fact within the knowledge of those responsible for the pleading which would have added to the weight of the respondent's case there is not the slightest reason for supposing that evidence of that fact would not have been forthcoming. But quite apart from that it would be a most unlawyerly proceeding to treat this pleading as of any judicial relevancy in the dispute between McKee and Phillip.\nThis is a conclusive answer to the suggestion, but it is only just, I think, to add that the course taken by the Trust Company as executor in making no claim to these moneys is not in the least difficult to understand; and indeed it would be difficult to suppose the experienced professional gentlemen who were advising the Trust Company taking any other course. The moneys in question had been paid by Arnold under an agreement executed by the appellant in consequence of Arnold's representation that he had authority to enter into it in the name of the supposed purchaser. Arnold's executor advancing a claim now to recover these moneys would be exposed to a conclusive defence in the estoppel created by Arnold's representation or, if the appellant chose to rely upon the true facts, to a counter-attack upon the ground that Arnold was responsible in damages under his warranty of authority, a field of litigation obviously not presenting an inviting prospect to a judicious representative of Arnold's estate. Personally the Trust Company having been repaid has no interest.\nANGLIN J.\u2014This case is, no doubt, very close to the line and there is not a little to be said in support of the position taken by Mr. Newcombe that the respondent (plaintiff by counterclaim) can only succeed upon the strength of his own title and that he has failed affirmatively to establish that it was his money that Arnold paid to McKee. On the other hand, it is certain that the money in question does not belong to McKee and that his only right to retain it is that of possession. It is also clear that the money belonged either to the respondent Phillip or to Arnold or to the Dominion Trust Company. The Dominion Trust Company in its own right and as executor of Arnold is a party to this litigation and in both capacities disclaims all right or title to the money. Under these circumstances, I am not convinced that the inference drawn by the majority of the judges in the Court of Appeal that the money belonged to Phillip is so clearly erroneous that we should reverse the judgment rendered in his favour. I would, therefore, dismiss this appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Bowser, Reid & Wallbridge.\nSolicitor for the respondent: C. S.

The plans for the bridge were approved of by competent authority, \"subject to and upon the condition that if at any time it is found that a passageway tor steamboats is required, the applicant company should provide the same\" upon being directed to do so either by the Department of Public Works or by the Board\" of Railway Commissioners. After the foundations of the bridge had been built, but before the superstructure had been erected, a letter was sent by the secretary of the Department of Public Works to the appellant, to say that he is directed to require the company to kindly submit plans for the swing spans necessary to provide passageways for boats. No attention was paid to the request and the bridge was completed without providing a passageway.\nPer Fitzpatrick C.J., Davies, Duff and Anglin JJ.\u2014Upon the evidence, the construction of the bridge was not the cause of the non-user of the river by the respondent's steamboat, Duff J. dissenting however on the ground that respondent was entitled to damages, because the steamer was prevented from making a trip by the presence of a cable which the appellant had placed athwart the river.\nPer Idington J. (dissenting).\u2014The order of the Board of Railway Commissioners must be held to have been conditional; and as, on the facts in evidence, leave to cross the river had been withheld by the Department of Public Works, there was an infringement of the respondent's rights. Per Duff and Anglin JJ.\u2014The condition contained in the order of the Board of Railway Commissioners did not contemplate a judicial \"finding\" by the Board itself before becoming operative.\nPer Anglin J.\u2014The placing of the bridge across the river without a passageway was unlawful and rendered the appellant liable for any actual damages sustained by the respondent such as would support a private action in respect of a public nuisance.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], reversing the judgment of Clement J. at the trial, by which the plaintiff's action was dismissed with costs. The material facts of the present case and the questions of law are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nBefore the institution of the present action in damages, an application was made, on behalf of the plaintiff company, for a mandatory injunction to compel the defendant company to cease obstructing the Fraser River, to remove the temporary bridge built across it and to make openings in two permanent steel bridges. This application for injunction was practically based on the same grounds as in the present action and was refused by Morrison J.[2].\nD. L. McCarthy K.C. and F. W. Tiffin for the appellant.\nS. S. Taylor K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The claim for damages put forward by the plaintiff respondent here involves the consideration of two questions: (1) the right of the defendant appellant to obstruct, in the year 1913 and 1914, by the erection of a fixed low level steel bridge, the navigation of the Upper Fraser River at the place referred to in the factums as the Second Crossing Bridge; (2) whether in fact the construction of the bridge at the Second Crossing in August, 1913, was the real cause of the non-user by the plaintiff respondent of the Upper Fraser.\nAt the trial the action was dismissed by Mr. Justice Clement.\nOn appeal the plaintiffs claim was allowed except for the damages in respect of the year 1914; so that, we are concerned only with the claim for loss of the profits which might have been earned had the plaintiff's steamer \"B. C. Express\" continued to operate on the Upper Fraser beyond the second crossing bridge during the autumn of 1913.\nThe plans for the bridge in question were approved of by competent authority in May, 1912, subject to and upon the condition that\nif at any time it is found that a passageway for steamboats is required the company (defendant) shall provide the same upon being directed so to do either by the Department of Public Works for the Dominion of Canada or by the Board of Railway Commissioners.\nThe foundations for the bridge were built and the steel for the superstructure manufactured and ready for erection, when, on the 4th July, 1913, a letter was written by R. C. Desrochers, Secretary of the Department of Public Works, to say\nthat he is directed to require the company to kindly submit plans for the swing spans necessary to provide passageways for boats in the bridge.\nApparently no attention was paid to this request, the bridge was completed on the original plans approved by the Governor-in-Council, and trains were operated over the bridge, presumably with the consent of the Department and the Railway Board, in August, 1913, and the bridge has ever since been used by the railway company for the passage of its trains. In these circumstances, it is difficult to say that the letter of the 4th July, 1913, was intended as a direction that the work on the bridge should not be proceeded with until new plans for a swing span bridge had been submitted and approved of. The Department could have prevented the operation of trains over the bridge at any time after construction and it no doubt would have exercised its power had the railway company built the bridge in defiance of a departmental order to the contrary. In any event the view I take of the second question makes it unnecessary for me to say more on this point.\nWhether the plaintiff respondent's steamer \"B. C. Express\" was prevented from navigating the waters of the Upper Fraser in the autumn of 1913, by reason of the construction of the second crossing bridge, is, in my opinion, a question of fact, the determination of which depends largely upon the weight to be given the evidence of the witnesses West and McCall, the representatives of the two companies, who chiefly directed their business operations at the time. The trial judge, who had both witnesses before him, tells us, that the impression left on his mind by the oral testimony, which was confirmed by a careful reading of the extended notes of the evidence, was that the construction of the bridge was not the cause of the non-user of the Upper Fraser by the \"B. C. Express.\" He also refers to the correspondence exchanged between the representatives of the two companies at the time of the occurrences now in question and holds that those letters point to the conclusion \"that the lowness of the water was explicitly given at the time as the reason for withdrawing the boat to the lower run,\" that is to the reaches of the Fraser River below Fort George. And to that extent McCall is corroborated. It is not even suggested anywhere in that correspondence that the company respondent suffered any loss by reason of the construction of the bridge or that the appellant company was in any way to blame.\nIt also appears from the oral evidence that the Upper River was blocked by the bridge at the second crossing about the 31st August, 1913, and that between that date and the 20th September following the depth of water was too low for the purpose of navigating a steamboat of the size and draught of the \"B. C. Express.\" Anticipating this change in the level of the water the boat was withdrawn from the Upper River and there is certainly nothing in the evidence, as I understand it, to justify the reversal of the trial judge's finding that the respondent company\ndid not then intend to resume operations even if water conditions improved.\nIn a letter written by Mr. West, 18th July, 1913, he says that\nthe upper part of the river between T\u00eate Jaune Cache and Fort George is only navigable for about two and a half to three months in the year and when I was at the Cache the other day we had a large quantity of freight stored there for delivery to Fort George and it is doubtful if we would be safe in accepting any more shipments for delivery this year.\nT\u00eate Jaune Cache was apparently the head of navigation at that time. In a letter written by Mr. Lesueur, accountant of the respondent company, of date 11th September, 1913, he says:\nOwing to the Upper River having such a low stage of water we were compelled to take our steamer off and she is now operating between Soda Creek and Fort George so that navigation on the Upper River is over for the remainder of the present season.\nMoreover, prior to the blocking of the river by the bridge the defendant's railway line had been completed to mile 145 B.C., a point below the bridge where temporary accommodation was provided to handle all freight from T\u00eate Jaune Cache. It was more convenient for the respondent company to operate in conjunction with the railway at that point than to run the risks attendant on the navigation of the river above at that season of the year.\nMr. West admits that this company had in contemplation that year the carriage of freight by water \"from the end of steel,\" i.e., from the point at which the railway could deliver the freight. His complaint made at the trial was that the company refused to carry his freight below the second crossing bridge and this complaint is certainly not borne out by the evidence, and he is contradicted by McCall who is apparently believed by the trial judge who says \"that there is not a hint that the defendant company was to blame.''\nBut the most striking commentary on Mr. West's evidence is his own letter to Mr. Hinton, General Passenger Agent of the railway, written on the 27th September, 1913, when to Mr. West's own knowledge the water in the Upper Fraser had risen again. In this letter he says that the steamboat service \"from Fort George to the 'end of steel' has practically closed,\" the \"end of steel\" then being below the bridge, and he asks if arrangements can be made for the interchange of traffic for the next season. This is a curious letter to write if the railway was at this time causing the company so much damage by blocking the river or refusing to deliver freight at mile 145 B.C.\nIt is significant that in all the correspondence exchanged, no complaint is made of improper interference by the railway with the right of navigation, and, in my opinion, this omission strongly supports the evidence of the witnesses that there was practically no business to be done on the Upper Eraser after the removal of the boat to the run from Soda Creek to Fort George in August. The constant effort of the respondent company even during the autumn and winter of 1912 was to keep down the amount of freight consigned to it at T\u00eate Jaune Cache and they were in this so successful that after the steamer \"B. C. Express\" left T\u00eate Jaune Cache on its last return trip to Fort George there remained at the Cache only three carloads of freight and this was taken by rail to the end of steel below the bridge whence it was taken in August by boat. And thereafter there was no freight lying at T\u00eate Jaune Cache consigned to consignees in care of the plaintiff respondent. There was practically no other through freight offering and the local freight was a negligible quantity; it was a mere incident not a factor in the operations of the company respondent. The freight coming in and consigned to the Fort George District would naturally go the end of steel where it could be more advantageously handled by respondent company as is not denied, but no attempt was made to that end.\nThe contemporaneous record of events to be found in the correspondence together with the oral evidence taken at the trial convince me that the findings of the trial judge are right and should not have been interfered with by the Court of Appeal.\nThis appeal should be allowed with costs.\nDavies J.\u2014This action was one brought to recover damages for loss of business and profits, etc., by the plaintiffs in the latter part of the year 1913 and the year 1914, owing to the construction by the railway, company of a bridge known as the second crossing bridge across the Fraser River, without providing a passageway for steamboats and which bridge prevented the plaintiffs from carrying on their business as steamboat carriers on that river above and beyond the place where it was constructed.\nThe trial judge's finding dismissing the action for damages claimed during the navigating season of 1914 was sustained by the Court of Appeal and no question arises here as to these alleged damages there having been no cross-appeal on that point.\nThe learned trial judge found that he was\nunable to find as a fact that the construction of the bridge at mile 142 was the cause of the non-user of the Fraser above that point by the plaintiff company after such constructing and that the essential element of causation had not been made out to his satisfaction or indeed at all.\nHe therefore dismissed the action.\nThe Court of Appeal, except with respect to that part of the judgment dismissing plaintiff's claim for 1914, set aside this judgment and directed a reference to ascertain the plaintiff's damages for the season of 1913, caused by the construction of the bridge.\nOn the appeal to this court, Mr. McCarthy contended that the order of the Board of Railway Commissioners had duly authorized the construction of the bridge complained of and that the condition in that order making it\nsubject to and upon the condition that if at any time it is found that a passageway for steamboats is required, the applicant company should provide the same upon being directed to do so either by the Department of Public Works or by the Board,\nimplied as a condition precedent to requiring the company to provide a passageway for steamboats there should be some finding either judicial or quasi judicial by some competent authority such as the Board itself before the company could be legally directed to provide such passageway, and that no such finding had been had or made. That the direction or order of the Department of Public Works requiring such passageway for boats was not given to the company until more than a year after they had built their foundation work in accordance with the plans approved of and did not profess to be the result of any such finding as the order of the Board of Railway Commissioners authorizing the construction of the bridge contemplated but on the contrary was a letter from the Secretary of the Department of Public Works expressed in these words:\nIn view of the protests which have been received against the construction by the company of fixed bridges at mile 274 and mile 316 west of Wolf Creek, B.C., I am directed to state that it will be necessary for the company to provide passageways for boats in these bridges.\nIn the view, however, that I take of this case and the proper conclusion to be drawn from the evidence given at the trial, including the correspondence which passed between the officials of the litigants, I do not find it necessary to express any opinion upon the contention of the appellant above outlined and I mention it to shew that it has not been overlooked. I do not think there is any difference of opinion with respect to the legal right of the plaintiff company to recover damages if they had proved any to have been suffered by them and caused by the construction of the bridge complained of in the latter part of the season of 1913.\nThe question before us is purely one of fact to be determined on the reading and consideration of the evidence and the correspondence.\nAfter such reading and consideration, I have come to the same conclusion as that reached by the trial judge, Clement J., and which I have above shortly epitomized. As that learned judge says:\u2014 In the correspondence the lowness of the water was explicitly given at the time as the reason for withdrawing the (steamer) \"B.C. Express\" to the lower run, not a hint that the defendant company was in any way to blame, and the oral testimony has convinced me that the plaintiff company never intended to resume operations that season above the bridge at mile 142 and I cannot bring myself to find that they could have done so, even in the actual water conditions which afterwards developed.\nIn deference to the opinion of the learned judges of the Court of Appeal who reached a different conclusion, I have felt myself obliged to give the oral evidence and the correspondence the closest attention and study with the result I have stated.\nI cannot see however that any good would result from a stated analysis of this evidence and correspondence which in the nature of the case would be very lengthy. Suffice it to say that I entertain no reasonable doubt as to the correctness of my conclusions.\nI would therefore allow the appeal with costs in this court and in the Court of Appeal and would restore the judgment of the trial judge.\nIdington J.\u2014I have considered the ingenious construction sought by counsel for appellant to be put upon the order of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada, but am unable to adopt the same.\nI think the words in question therein must mean if it is in fact \"found that a passageway for steamboats is required\" then the conditions of the order must be complied with and that the order as a whole must be held to have been conditional.\nApart from the ambiguous language used in the order it must be borne in mind that the Board had no jurisdiction to impose upon any navigable stream a barrier to the navigation thereof without the authority of the Government. Such is my interpretation and construction of the \"Railway Act\" and that the several provisions giving powers to the Board designed to aid in the details to be adopted for the facilitating of crossing such streams by railways are all subservient to that paramount power entrusted to the Governor-in-Council relative to the ultimate decision of granting or refusing permission and the terms and compliance with the terms upon which such leave to cross may be granted.\nThat never was given, but on the contrary, through the Department of Public Works, seems to have been withheld.\nAs in that view there was on the facts in evidence an infringement of the respondent's rights and a clear deprivation in one instance at least by reason of the conduct of the appellant's servants, of the respondent's rights, I fail to see why the action cannot be maintained.\nIt is not open to us on this appeal to determine the matters in dispute further.\nMuch of the argument in the appellant's factum designed to uphold the position that there was no infringement is much more applicable to the question of the measure of the damages, than to what is involved in the appeal.\nIf there were any damages in fact suffered no matter how small, by reason of a legal wrong done, the appeal fails.\nIt would, therefore, serve no good purpose for us to enter upon the many apparently cogent reasons put forward bearing upon the measure of damages.\nThese reasons, of course, are properly put forward in order if possible to demonstrate that there was no damage suffered. In my opinion they fall short of complete demonstration that there was no damage in fact of any sort.\nI agree in the reasoning of Mr. Justice Galliher, relative to the main issue presented and need not repeat the same here.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014I concur in the view of the learned trial judge that the claim for damages in respect of the interruption of navigation at mile 142 during the later season of high water in 1913, that is to say, from the 20th Sept. onward, must fail. The presence of the bridge, although it made navigation in fact impossible, had nothing to do with the discontinuance by the respondents of their operations above mile 142. Before the recurrence in September of conditions making navigation possible above the site of the bridge the \"B.\" C. Express\" had been withdrawn for service elsewhere and I agree with the trial judge that she had been withdrawn with the settled intention on the part of the respondent company not \"to resume operations that season above mile 142.\" That interruption, therefore, however illegal, was not in the juridical sense the cause of any actual loss to the respondents.\nMr. Justice Galliher appears to suggest that the doctrine of Lyon v. Fishmongers Co.[3], applies since he appears to assume there was an invasion of the rights of the respondents as riparian owners in virtue of their wharf and warehouse at T\u00eate Jaune Cache. Such riparian rights are rights incidental to proprietorship or rather perhaps rights of proprietorship, Kensit v. Great Eastern Railway Company[4], at p. 133, Esquimalt Water Works v. Victoria[5], at pp. 320 and 322, and invasion of them without legal justification or excuse gives rise to a right of action even in the absence of actual pecuniary loss. Such an invasion is in the fullest sense injuria. It appears to be suggested as mentioned above, that the respondents have been wronged in respect of their riparian rights. With respect, that could not, I think, be sustained. There was an obstruction of the navigation of the river at \"mile 142\" and in that respect an interference with the public right; but there was not infringement of the private rights of the respondents incidental to the ownership or occupation of a property nearly 100 miles away; and the respondents could therefore only succeed by shewing that in consequence of the violation of the public right, they had suffered some loss peculiar to themselves. In this I agree with Clement J. in holding that they have failed as I have said.\nThere is evidence, however, that during the continuance of the earlier season of navigation, that is, during the second half of August, the passage of the \"B. C. Express\" up the river was actually stopped\u2014a trip to T\u00eate Jaune Cache on which she was bound being actually prevented by the presence of a cable athwart the river at mile 142 which the appellants had placed there. My conclusion from the evidence is that the presence of this obstruction is proved and that there is sufficient evidence of actual loss in consequence of it to establish a right of action. If the appeal were to be disposed of in accordance with my notions I should direct a reference to ascertain the amount of damages properly awardable in reparation for this interference with respondents in their use of the river.\nThe view just expressed involves, of course, a decision against the appellants of the point raised by Mr. McCarthy's contention that the appellants are not chargeable with illegality but that their act in constructing the bridge as and where they did, was done strictly under the sanction of law, and that point must be briefly noticed.\nThe relevant statutory provision is sec. 233 of the \"Railway Act,\" ch. 37, R.S.C., which is in these words:\u2014\nSection 233:\u2014When the company is desirous of constructing any wharf, bridge, tunnel, pier or other structure or work, in, upon, over, under, through, or across any navigable water or canal or upon the beach, bed or lands covered with the waters thereof, the Company shall, before the commencement of any such work,\u2014\n(a) in the case of navigable water, not a canal, submit to the Minister of Public Works, and in the case of a canal to the Minister, for approval by the Governor-in-Council, a plan and description of the proposed site for such work, and a general plan of the work to be constructed, to the satisfaction of such Minister; and\n(b) upon approval by the Governor-in-Council of such site and plans, apply to the Board for an order authorizing the construction of the work, and, with such application, transmit to the Board a certified copy of the Order-in-Council and of the plans and description approved thereby, and also detail plans and profiles of the proposed work, and such other plans, drawings and specifications as the Board may, in any such case, or by regulation, require.\n2. No deviation from the site or plans approved by the Governor-in-Council, shall be made without the consent of the Governor-in-Council.\n3. Upon any such application, the Board may:\n(a) make such order in regard to the construction of such work upon such terms and conditions as it may deem expedient;\n(b) make alterations in the detail plans, profiles, drawings and specifications so submitted;\n(c) give directions respecting the supervision of any such work; and,\n(d) require that such other works, structures, equipment, appliances and materials be provided, constructed, maintained, used and operated, and measures taken, as under the circumstances of each case may appear to the Board best adapted for securing the protection, safety and convenience of the public.\n4. Upon such order being granted, the company shall be authorized to construct such work in accordance therewith.\n5. Upon the completion of any such work the company shall, before using or operating the same, apply to the Board for an order authorizing such use or operation, and if the Board is satisfied that its orders and directions have been carried out, and that such work may be used or operated without danger to the public, and that the provisions of this section have been complied with, the Board may grant such order. 3 Ed. VII., c. 58, s. 182.\nThe approval of the Governor-in-Council is expressed in an Order-in-Council dated 8th May, 1912, by which the appellant's plans for the construction of their bridge are\napproved subject to the condition that should it be found at any time that passageways are required in these bridges for steamboats the Company shall provide the said passageways upon being requested to do so by the Department of Public Works.\nThe order of the Board of Railway Commissioners authorizing the construction of the bridge is dated 4th April, 1912, and the grant of authority is declared to be \"subject to and upon the condition that if at any time it is found that a passageway for steamboats is required the applicant Company shall provide the same, being directed to do so either by the Department of Public Works for the Dominion of Canada or the Board.\" On July 4th, 1913, the Department of Public Works directed that a swing span should be provided to meet the requirements of navigation but the company proceeded with the construction of a low level bridge in accordance with the plans previously approved (by the order of 8th May, 1912) making no such provision, and the river seems to have been closed as a consequence of this about the 24th August, 1913.\nAt the time the notice of the Department's demand was received nothing had been done to obstruct navigation of the river, although much had of course been done in making and assembling parts. I think the direction of the Department does come within the four corners of the power reserved by the condition.\nMr. McCarthy argued that the condition required a \"finding\" by the Board of Railway Commissioners before becoming operative. The argument is worthy of serious examination because the power reserved did not cease to be exercise-able upon the erection of the bridge; and indeed it must have been evident, if the matter was considered, that the exercise of it even before the erection of the bridge might prove costly and burthensome for the Railway Company, and we should naturally expect to find the decision of such a question hedged about by those guarantees which are usually afforded by a judicial inquiry.\nUnfortunately the condition contemplates action by either the Department of Public Works or the Board; and in the case of the Department it is too clear that it is to act as an administrative department and it seems impossible to escape the conclusion that the question is left to the Department as a question of policy. If the Department had refused a hearing to the Railway Company a different question might have arisen.\nSuch a condition seems to be within the authority of the Board under sec. 233 (3-a); and at all events there can be no doubt of the power of the Governor-in-Council to exact such a condition in approving plans under sec. 233 (a). The stipulation once entered into gives rise to an obligation on the part of the Railway Company enforceable by the Crown on behalf of the public and when not performed and private loss is suffered in consequence of non-performance, to a right of action for reparation.

Westwood[11] at page 92; Mayor of Lyme Regis v. Henley[12], at p. 355.\nThe judgment under appeal ought, therefore, in my opinion, to be varied by directing a reference as to damages in respect of the actual obstruction caused by the cable placed across the river in August, but subject to that, dismissed.\nAnglin J.\u2014Mr. McCarthy, appearing for the appellants, presented to us a view of the order of the Board of Railway Commissioners, under which the bridge in question was constructed, which was not submitted to the provincial courts. Apart from the objection to its being entertained based upon that fact, I cannot agree with Mr. McCarthy's contention that, on the proper construction of the order of the Board, it was necessary, before a request binding on the company to provide a passageway in its bridge could be validly made by the Department of Public Works, that there should be a finding by the Board of Railway. Commissioners that such a passage was necessary. As I read the order the request might be validly made at any time either by the Board itself or by the Department of Public Works upon its appearing to either of them that a passageway was required.\nMoreover, the approval of the plans for the bridge by the Governor-in-Council, prescribed by sec. 233 of the \"Railway Act,\" was expressly made subject to the condition that the company should furnish passageways for boats, upon being requested to do so by the Department of Public Works if it should be found at any time that such passageways were required. The Department having notified the company before the bridge in question was constructed that it would be necessary for it to provide a passageway for boats, the placing of a bridge across the river without such a passageway and so constructed that it caused an obstruction to navigation in contravention of sec. 230 of the \"Railway Act\" was, in my opinion, unlawful and rendered the company liable for any actual damages sustained by the plaintiffs such as would support a private action in respect of a public nuisance.\nOn the other hand, however, after carefully considering all the evidence, particularly the correspondence read in the light of the oral testimony, I think the conclusions reached by the learned trial judge\nthat the plaintiff company never intended to resume operations that season (i.e., in 1913) above the bridge at mile 142,\nand would not\nhave done so even in the actual water conditions which afterwards developed\nwere correct and should not have been disturbed. It is very significant that, although the alleged interruption to navigation took place in August, 1913, there appears to have been no complaint about it on the part of the plaintiffs until the following year. On the contrary, correspondence between representatives of the parties in September, 1913, appears to be inconsistent with an intention on the part of the plaintiffs to prefer a claim for damages in respect of interruption of their business in that year.\nOn the 18th of July, 1913, in answer to a request by the defendant company for information as to the plaintiff's intentions with regard to the route in question in order to inform their representatives in the east as to the routing of freight, Mr. West, Superintendent of the plaintiff company, wrote Under the difficult conditions which we have had to operate this summer we think it advisable not to advertise the route or encourage shippers to send their goods by the Cache unless they are prepared to handle the same in scows from that point to Fort George.\nEarlier in the same letter he said:\nThe upper part of the river between T\u00eate Jaune Cache and Fort George is only navigable for about 2\u00bd to 3 months in the year * * * and it is doubtful if we would be safe in accepting any more shipments for delivery this year.\nActing upon this information the defendant company notified its agents on the 30th of July that:\nUntil further notice we will decline to accept freight consigned to the British Columbia Express Company at T\u00eate Jaune Cache for Fort George.\nThough aware of this notice having been sent out the plaintiffs took no exception to it. On the evidence of Mr. Boucher, the plaintiffs' agent at T\u00eate Jaune Cache, I incline to think that, as a result, immediately before traffic was interrupted by the construction of the bridge they had only two loads of freight left above the bridge, one at T\u00eate Jaune Cache, the other at mile 129. The latter they took away themselves on the day when traffic closed; the former was brought for them to a point below the bridge by the defendant company and was taken away by them. Any other freight which came to T\u00eate Jaune that season was consigned, I should infer from Mr. Boucher's evidence, for shipment to Fort George by scows. This evidence further strengthens the view taken by the learned trial judge that the plaintiffs had no intention of resuming navigation of the route in question after the water conditions in August interrupted it.\nOn the whole case, while the plaintiffs may have sustained some injuria at the hands of the defendants, it appears to have been injuria sine damno. The making of a claim in respect of loss of business in 1913 would seem to have been an afterthought and action in respect of it would in all probability never have been taken had proceedings not been instituted in connection with the business of 1914, for which it has been held by the British Columbia courts that the plaintiffs have not an actionable claim.\nI would, for these reasons, allow this appeal with costs in this court and the Court of Appeal of British Columbia and would restore the judgment of the trial judge.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Tiffin & Alexander.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Taylor, Harvey, Grant, Stockton & Smith.\n[1] 27 D.L.R. 497; 10 West W.R. 477, 583.\n[2] 20 B.C.Rep. 215.\n[3] 1 App. Cas. 662.\n[4] 27 Ch.D. 122.\n[5] 12 B.C.

But the respondent, with full knowledge of such fraud and apparently under pressure of a forfeiture clause, gave an option on these lots to a third party and paid without protest to the appellant an instalment due under the contract.\nHeld, Davies and Anglin JJ. dissenting, that, upon the evidence, the acts of the respondent did not constitute ratification or confirmation of the contract.\nPer Fitzpatrick C.J.:\u2014When the validity of a contract is attacked on account of an error as to the identity of its object, the question of confirmation cannot arise, as there can be no confirmation of a thing which has never existed.\nPer Anglin J. dissenting:\u2014Where a purchaser knows facts that render his obligation voidable, payment of purchase money and giving options on the property are unequivocal acts of confirmation. While error of law may render such acts inefficacious for that purpose, the person alleging such error must prove it; and the mere presence of a forfeiture clause in an agreement known to be voidable does not constitute moral restraint which will make them involuntary.\nAppeal from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side[1], confirming the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal, Panneton J., and maintaining the plaintiff's action with costs. The material facts of the case are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nLafleur K.C. and Rinfret for the appellant.\nBelcourt K.C. and Prudhomme for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The appellant company, defendant below, is the owner of a farm at Pointe-aux-Trembles, on the Island of Montreal, which is subdivided into lots and offered for sale to the public. The respondent, plaintiff below, is a member of a syndicate formed to purchase a certain number of those lots.\nThe action is brought to set aside a contract entered into by the appellant with the syndicate which was intended to operate merely as a promise to sell the lots in question. The respondent's contention is that she was induced to enter into the contract by fraud, treachery and false representations. A preliminary question having reference to the right of the respondent to bring such action without citing the other parties to the syndicate agreement was raised for the first time in the court appealed from. No notice appears to have been taken of this objection in the formal judgment of that court and neither of the two judges whose notes are in the record refer to it. In the appellant's factum the point is dealt with in a few lines, and I do not feel that, under such circumstances, it is necessary for me, in the view which I take of the case, to do more than say that this question of procedure, which certainly suggests difficulties of a serious nature, has not been entirely overlooked.\nDealing with the merits. The false and fraudulent representations complained of relate to statements made by the appellant's agent as to the situation of the lots with respect to Bleau street, the River St. Lawrence, the cement factory and the tramway proximity to which would presumably increase their value for speculative purposes. Some point is also made of the fact that' one of the members of the syndicate, and the most active, was, unknown to the respondent, the selling agent of the owners of the property and as such in receipt of a secret commission.\nIt is important, in considering the case, to bear in mind that the respondent was one of a group who jointly purchased a certain number of lots in each one of which all would have an undivided interest, a fact which, in my judgment, adds to the difficulties in one aspect of the case.\nIf the respondent attached much importance to the precise location of the lots, she would, I think, have taken more trouble to ascertain their exact position. A reference to paragraph 8 of respondent's declaration makes it abundantly clear, however, that she never intended to become a purchaser of any one or more of the lots separately, but rather to acquire an undivided interest in the whole property included within the cadastral area, to be held and disposed of for purely speculative purposes. And the impression left on my mind, after a very careful examination of the whole record, is that the respondent sought to repudiate the transaction and to obtain relief from her obligations thereunder after she realised that the bottom had dropped out of the real estate boom and that her venture would, in all probability, prove unprofitable. To some extent the courts below seem to have been influencedin the conclusion they reached by a desire laudable in itself to discourage a tendency amounting almost to a mania for wildcat speculations in real estate which seems to have developed in the Montreal district. But I am convinced that in so far as courts are concerned with such matters the object in view can be more effectively accomplished by holding steadfastly to the rule that men and women also are expected to\nkeep sacred their covenants.\nand that they will be held to a strict fulfilment of their obligations legally contracted. Our duty is, in last analysis, to render justice, not ideal justice, but justice\naccording to law.\nTo make my point perfectly clear I will refer to the facts.\nOn or about the 28th. May, 1912, the syndicate agreement, which it is now sought to set aside, was signed. On or about 22nd July following the promise of sale was executed in triplicate. The respondent did not, at the outset, attach much importance to the exact location of the lots because it is impossible to understand from her evidence whether she visited the locus before signing the syndicate agreement. In her evidence, she makes two contradictory statements within five lines as to this point. It seems perfectly clear, however, that she did not go on the ground with Mrs. Bessette before signing the promise of sale but was content to pass through the property on a tram car without even taking the trouble to leave her seat. Mrs. Bessette, by a wave of the hand, indicated the approximate location of the lots in question at the upper end of a forty-acre field. Further, it is to be borne in mind, that in the promise of sale the lots are described by reference to a plan which is not disputed, and in the interval between the two agreements the respondent visited the property with Langelier, the selling agent of the appellant. Moreover, before signing the promise of sale, the respondent insisted upon consulting Mr. Charruau, whom she described as her \"homme de confiance,\" and it was only after obtaining his assurance that she was making a good bargain that she signed the document. At the time she sought the independent advice of Mr. Charruau she certainly seems to have been placed in possession of all the information she thought necessary to have, and subsequently she gave her cheque for $1,000, and signed the promise of sale.\nThere were meetings of the syndicate held in early October, 1912, when all the facts were admittedly known and an option was then given Mrs. Boutillier, and another option was given the Charruau Realty Co. In November following a payment on account of the purchase price was made. All this tends to confirm my impression that the respondent sought to repudiate the transaction only after she was satisfied that her venture would not be immediately profitable and the only real error made was in her calculation of the probable result of her investment.\nThe appellant relied largely on the fact that with full knowledge of the deceit practised on her the respondent subsequently adopted and ratified the contract.\nThere can be in this case no question of ratification in the sense in which that term is used in the civil law. Planiol says:\u2014\nce mot ratification d\u00e9signe sp\u00e9cialement l'approbation donn\u00e9e par le ma\u00eetre aux actes du g\u00e9rant d'affaires.\nIn my view of the case, the question of confirmation does not arise either. The alleged error or mistake was with respect to the subject matter of the contract, that is, the identity of the lots. The respondent puts his case on the facts in those words:\u2014.\nQuelque temps apr\u00e8s, Ton a d\u00e9couvert que la terre s'\u00e9tendait bien au del\u00e0 du petit bois qui bornait la vue et que les lots qu'on avait indiqu\u00e9s comme \u00e9tant situ\u00e9s en de\u00e7\u00e0 dv bois se troinaient situ\u00e9s partie dans le bois et partie au del\u00e0 du bois, aboutissait au trait carr\u00e9 des terres de St. L\u00e9onard de Port Maurice, c'est\u00e0-dire \u00e0 quatre ou cinq arpents plus loin que l'endroit que la compagnie appelante avait indiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e et aux autres syndicataires.\nThe judgment of the Superior Court has this considerant:\u2014\nConsid\u00e9rant que la demanderesse n'eut pas achet\u00e9 sa part dans les dits lots si elle eut su qu'ils n'\u00e9taient pas \u00e0 l'endroit indiqu\u00e9 par l'agent et la sous-agente de la d\u00e9fenderesse.\nMr. Justice Crosslin the Court of Appeal, says:\u2014\nHer grounds of action are that her consent to the contract was obtained by fraud, trickery and false representations that it was represented that the lots were on Bleau street whereas they are a long distance from it in a forest at the rear of the farm in the Parish of St. L\u00e9onard; that it was represented that the lots were near certain cement works, about ten arpents from the River St. Lawrence, whereas they are more than 20 arpents from there and far distant from and without access to the lower part of the farm of which they form part.\nAnd Mr. Justice Pelletier says:\u2014\nCependant il y a plus. It est \u00e9tabli au dossier que les lots en question ne sont pas situ\u00e9s \u00e0 l'endroit o\u00f9 on a repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 qu'ils \u00e9taient et o\u00f9 on a pr\u00e9tendu les montrer.\nIf the mistake was brought about by fraud one can regard either the mistake or the fraud, but, in my opinion, the alleged error might have been avoided if the respondent had taken reasonable care and, as I have already said, she did not take care. She was not interested in any one or more lots but in the general scheme. Of course, if one contracting party is induced to enter into a contract by fraud on the part of the other, he can either confirm the contract or impeach its validity But here the respondent says there was no contract because there was error with respect to the identity of the lots and both courts below have so found and therefore the question of confirmation does not arise.\nThere are some differences of opinion among the authors as to the circumstances under which confirmation must take place, but of course all agree there can be no confirmation of something which never existed. \"On ne confirme pas une nullit\u00e9.\" Planiol, vol. II., Nos. 1293 and following, in a few paragraphs, states the generally accepted opinion.\nIn last analysis one must bear in mind in a case like this that all the surrounding circumstances must be looked at and the trial judge, who not only sees the witnesses but also breathes the very atmosphere in which the transaction was entered upon, enjoys a position of exceptional advantage. He, no doubt, was to some extent influenced by what Planiol describes as\nla physionomie de l'audience qui est un des \u00e9l\u00e9ments impond\u00e9rables de la jurisprudence.\nI am, reluctantly, to confirm and agree to do so because of the concurrent findings below.\nDavies J. (dissenting)\u2014I think this appeal must be allowed with costs.\nThere was, no doubt, such misrepresentation of material facts with respect to the location of the lands agreed to be purchased as would have justified the respondent when she discovered the true facts in repudiating the bargain she had made.\nThe contract, however, was not a void but a voidable one, and when she made the discovery as to the true location of the lands she could, within a reasonable time, have repudiated it. It was within her power, on such discovery, either to adopt or to repudiate the contract.\nNow she took plenty of time to reach a decision. She consulted with all those who, like herself, had bought one or more of the lots as to the best course to adopt. They were all speculators sailing in the same boat. They did not buy the lands to use themselves but to sell at a profit. Several meetings were held at which the question was discussed. The main point as to which they hesitated was as to the chances of a rise in value of the lots.\nIn the ultimate result, the scales turned in favour of a probable rise in value and the respondent, with full knowledge of all material facts, elected to adopt the contract and paid a further instalment of her purchase money.\nHer expectations were not realised, the value of the land did not rise on the market, quite the contrary, and then defendant, respondent, attempted to reverse her election and repudiate her contract.\nIn my judgment she was then too late. She had already, with knowledge of the facts, elected and was bound by her election.\nIdington J.\u2014Mr. Lafleur, of counsel for appellant, having properly conceded at the outset of his argument that, having regard to the jurisprudence of this court, it did not seem open to him to ask a reversion of the concurrent findings of fact by two courts below, but submitted that notwithstanding such findings there was, on undisputed facts, a ratification and adoption by respondent of the contract notwithstanding its originally being liable to repudiation.\nI cannot say that under all the peculiar circumstances in which respondent was placed her assenting to the several nominees of the syndicate making attempts to resell was conclusive evidence of an intention on her part to ratify and abide by the contract.\nIf she alone had bargained and been caught in such a difficult situation I do not think an effort on her part to resell before launching upon a sea of litigation must of itself be held to be proof of ratification.\nAgain the payment of the November instalment was demanded and pressed for and she had to choose between the risk of forfeiting the $1,000 she had already paid before discovering that she had been misled or of making the payment pending the expiration of the time given one of the said nominees to procure a sale.\nThese two circumstances of assenting to the attempt to resell and the payment of the money in November are thus so connected and dependent upon each other, that it comes back to a question of holding that such attempts as made to avoid litigation were conclusive proof of ratification.\nI do not think she can be properly held to have finally determined to abandon her right of revocation.\nThe few months that elapsed after the payment and expiration of the option to resell before entering this action adds materially very little to the other circumstances.\nIt is not the length of time alone that is to be looked at for that might not count for much, but that is to be taken in connection with the other circumstances which, in such like cases, must be weighed.\nOn the whole, all taken together in light of the surrounding facts and circumstances existent herein, and with which I need not labour, do not satisfactorily establish an intention on respondent's part to ratify the contract or waive her right.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014In the special circumstances of this case I am satisfied that the judgment below cannot properly be reversed. This conclusion involves no point of general application.\nAnglin J. (dissenting) \u2014 The plaintiff, Dame Sarault, sues to have an agreement made by herself and others for the purchase of suburban land near Montreal declared void on the ground that her assent to it was procured by fraudulent misrepresentation, and for the return of the sums of $1,037.06 and $148 paid by her on account of the purchase money. Denying the misrepresentations alleged, the defendant also pleads prescription, nonjoinder of necessary parties and confirmation.\nThe making of the representations, their untruth, their fraudulent character, and that they induced the contract\u2014all these facts have been found by the learned trial judge, whose judgment for the plaintiff was unanimously affirmed by the Court of King's Bench. While not altogether satisfied that, if sitting as a trial judge, I should have reached all these conclusions, there is enough evidence in support of them in the record to render the appeal upon this branch of the case hopeless; and it was practically not pressed.\nThe plea of prescription is ill founded, the case, being governed, as Mr. Justice Pelletier points out, not by art. 1530 C.C., but by art. 2258 C.C.\nIt may be that joinder of the plaintiff's co-purchasers as parties is not required, if, as she contends, the relief sought by her will merely have the effect of vesting her interest in the defendant. In the view I take of the merits it is unnecessary to pass upon this question, which may be somewhat formidable in view of the joint character of the purchasers' obligations. Arts. 521 and 177 (8) C.P. But see arts. 1124 and 1125 C.C.\nThe defence of confirmation involves very important questions. That this defence was first raised by a supplementary plea seems to me immaterial. The facts upon which it depends, as accepted by the learned trial judge and in the Court of King's Bench, are that after the plaintiff had obtained full knowledge of the untruth of the misrepresentation on which she now relies to obtain rescission of the contract, she and her co-adventurers gave to two persons successively options upon or exclusive agencies to sell the lots in which they were interested and that she also made payment to the defendant of an instalment of the purchase money due by her under the contract.\nThe trial judge deals with this aspect \"of the case in a single paragraph:\u2014\nConsid\u00e9rant en ce qui regarde la confirmation subs\u00e9quente de la vente que vu que la d\u00e9fenderesse refusait d'annuler la promesse de vente, la demanderesse n'a fait des d\u00e9marches pour vendre ces lots que pour \u00e9viter un proc\u00e8s en annulation, si elle pouvait ainsi vendre sans perdre beaucoup d'argent, et que le paiement qu'elle a fait en octobre, 1912, l'a \u00e9t\u00e9 pour se prot\u00e9ger contre le droit qu'avait la d\u00e9fenderesse de r\u00e9silier le contrat en gardant le paiement qu'elle avait re\u00e7u comptant.\nUpon examining the record I have failed to find any evidence of a refusal by the defendant to cancel the contract, if that be material. No demand for rescission appears to have been made until long after the options had been given by the plaintiff and her co-adventurers and the payment relied upon had been made by her.\nIn the Court of King's Bench reasons for judgment were delivered only by Cross and Pelletier JJ. Mr. Justice Cross deals with the defence of confirmation in these two sentences:\nIn regard to the plea of adoption of and adhesion to the contract after having had full knowledge of the facts, it is to be said that what the respondent did in the way of joining in an attempt to sell the lots does not necessarily shew an intention to abandon the right to ask for rescission. It is to be remembered that she stood confronted by a stiff covenant for forfeiture of all she had paid in, if she did not' keep on paying.\nMr. Justice Pelletier discusses the question at greater length.' In substance he says the payment relied upon was made by the plaintiff under pressure of a forfeiture clause in the agreement and was not accompanied by a protest because she was without professional advice and a former protest had been of no avail. In making this payment the plaintiff sought only to guard against another danger\u2014the loss of the money she had already invested. That is not acquiescence; it lacks the feature of positive abandonment of the right to rescind which is essential. As to the effort made to sell, it was merely an attempt to get rid of the property without litigation which certainly did not imply acquiescence.\nWith great respect, I have not found any evidence of a former protest; absence of professional advice also seems to have been assumed. The learned judge's reference to the necessity for\nun acte positif abandonnant les droits qu'on a\nmight seem to imply that in his opinion there could not be tacit or implied confirmation; but he, of course, did not intend that. There is not a single authority cited upon this branch of the case in any of the judgments.\nThe supplementary plea raising the defence of confirmation is as follows:\u2014\n2. M\u00eame si cette erreur e\u00fbt exist\u00e9, ce que la d\u00e9fenderesse nie la demanderesse a persist\u00e9 dans le contrat apr\u00e8s que, de son propre aveu, tous les faits lui furent connus, et a fait des actes de propri\u00e9taire, en chargeant certaines personnes, ou agents d'immeubles, de vendre les lots pour elle, entr'autres le 3 octobre et le 31 octobre 1912.\n3. En plus, m\u00eame apr\u00e8s que la demanderesse se fut aper\u00e7ue de cette pr\u00e9tendue erreur, elle a n\u00e9anmoins ratifi\u00e9 et confirm\u00e9 le contrat en faisant des paiements trimestriels subs\u00e9quemment, sans r\u00e9serve ni restriction.\nThe plaintiff's answer is in the following terms:\u2014\n1. La demanderesse nie les paragraphes 1, 2, et 3 de la d\u00e9fense; Et elle ajoute ce qui suit:\n2. Qu'elle n'a charg\u00e9 aucun agent d'immeubles ou autres de vendre les lots vu qu'elle s'est toujours plainte \u00e0 la d\u00e9fenderesse et \u00e0 ses agents qu'elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 tromp\u00e9e et qu'elle n'avait pas les lots qu'elle avait voulu acheter et que c'\u00e9tait, dans le but simplement de t\u00e2cher de rentrer dans les d\u00e9bours\u00e9s qu'elle avait faits vu que les agents ne voulaient pas lui remettre son argent; 3. Elle n'a jamais ratifi\u00e9 ni confirm\u00e9 en aucune mani\u00e8re que ce soit la promesse de vente qui est maintenant attaqu\u00e9e et si elle a fait un paiement suppl\u00e9mentaire, c'\u00e9tait sous l'empire de l'erreur dans laquelle elle \u00e9tait, ne sachant quoi faire pour pr\u00e9server le montant de $1,000 qu'elle avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 debours\u00e9, gr\u00e2ce aux fausses repr\u00e9sentations de la d\u00e9fenderesse et de ses agents.\nAs will have been perceived the grounds on which the plea of confirmation has been rejected are that the plaintiff attempted to dispose of the lots merely to avoid litigation and loss of her money, and that she made the payment relied upon by the defendant to prevent the latter acting on a forfeiture clause enabling it to cancel the contract, retaining the money which had been already paid on account. The allegation of the plaintiff 's answer that when she did the alleged confirmatory acts she was labouring under mistake (sous l'empire de l'erreur) is ignored both by the trial judge and in the court of appeal. If by it the plaintiff means that she was still without knowledge of the defendants' fraud, her allegation is directly contrary to her own evidence and that of her friends, and a finding upon it in her favour could not be supported. If she means that she acted under misapprehension as to the effect of the defendant's fraud on her obligation under the contract, or as to her own legal rights (which was the main contention presented on her behalf in this court) unless it is involved in the holding that she made the second payment under pressure of the forfeiture clause, she has failed to obtain a finding of these facts. The judgment in her favour does not rest upon this plea.\nPerhaps a few of the leading features of the law of confirmation may be noticed without inviting a charge of pedantry or incurring the reproach of dwelling upon the elementary.\nIn Art. 1214 the Civil Code states the essential features of an express act of confirmation. It makes no allusion to implied or tacit confirmation such as is found in art. 1338 C.N. That, no doubt, was merely because to do so was deemed unnecessary. 4 Langelier, p. 201; 6 Mignault, 31n.\nAlthough the Code apparently ignores the distinction (art. 1214 C.C.), confirmation differs from ratification. 6 Mignault, p. 31; 4 Aubry & Rau, 1902, p. 430; Baudry-Lacantinerie, Des Oblig. III., No. 1985; 6 Larombi\u00e8re, Oblig., Art. 1338, No. 3; 8 Huc, No. 276. There can be no confirmation of the null and void; confirmation applies only to the voidable or annullable. 5 Marcad\u00e9, art. 1338, sec. 1, p. 94; Baudry-Lacantinerie, Des Oblig., III., No. 1992; 4 Aubry & Rau, 1902, p. 429; 8 Huc, No. 276.\nWhile error and fraud are causes of nullity in contracts (art. 991 C.C.), they are not causes of absolute nullity; they only give a right of action or exception to annul or rescind them (art. 1000 C.C.) Error in the object of a contract amounting to mistake in its identity precludes consent with the result that the obligation is non-existent, or absolutely null. Error concerning the object short of this, however substantial, does not preclude consent and therefore an obligation results, although voidable and subject to rescission. It is with this kind of error that the Code deals in the articles cited. 5 Mignault, p. 212; 15 Laurent, No. 84; Baudry-Lacantinerie, Des Oblig. III., Nos. 52-53 et seq.; Pothier, Des Oblig. No. 17; 4 Marcad\u00e9, art. 1110, Nos. 1 & 2; Fuzier-Herman, Rep. Vbo. \"Erreur,\" No. 21 & No. 26; Dalloz, R\u00e9p. Pratique, \"Contrats et Conventions en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral,\" Nos. 72 (2), 75 (tr.). In the plaintiff's declaration error is referred to not as a ground for relief but as a consequence of the fraud relied upon. Voidability is claimed not on account of error but fraud. The error shewn at the trial was not as to the identity of the property, but only as to whether it all lay between the road and a clump of trees or whether part of it lay beyond these trees, and as to its proximity to a cement manufactory.\nIn answer to the plea of confirmation the plaintiff alleged not that the contract was not susceptible of confirmation because of absolute nullity entailed by mistake as to the identity of the object, but that the circumstances under which the alleged confirmatory acts were done rendered them ineffectual as confirmation The judgments at the trial and in the Court of King's Bench deal with the question of the sufficiency of the confirmation. There is no suggestion of absolute nullity on account of error as to the identity of the object. Nor was any such argument presented in this court. The evidence establishes that while there was no doubt error, induced by fraud, as to features of the property dealt with, which formed the principal consideration for making the contract (art. 992 C.C.) there was not in fact mistake as to the identity of the property such as would preclude consent. The contract was not void or absolutely null; it was voidable or annullable under arts. 991-2-3 and 1000 of the Civil Code, and it was as such a contract that the plaintiff presented it claiming a declaration that it had been obtained illegally and fraudulently.\nThe existence in Quebec law of the doctrine of implied confirmation and the conformity of some of its main features to those of the corresponding doctrine in English law was recognised by the Judicial Committee in United Shoe Machinery Co. of Canada v. Brunet[2].\nIt is clearly logical, says Laurent (XVIII. No. 624), that the requisites of tacit confirmation should be the same as those of express confirmation, since confirmation however evidenced, is one and the same juridical fact (fait juridique).\nUnder both the English and the French systems of law the essential features of confirmation are that the act invoked as confirmatory must be done voluntarily, with knowledge of the voidability of the principal act or obligation which is to be confirmed, and with the intention of confirming it. Comp. 5 Marcad\u00e9, sec. 5, No. IV., p. 98; Aubry & Rau (1902), sec. 337, 2\u00b0 and n. 21, p. 438, with Murray v. Palmer[3]; and Moxon v. Payne[4].\nAlthough Toullier (VIII. 519) and Merlin (Quest-Vbo, Ratification, sec. 5, No. 5) were of the opinion that where an act in execution or fulfilment of a voidable obligation is relied upon as confirmatory, the party so preferring it is called upon only to prove that it was done voluntarily (in the sense of freely), the modern writers agree that he must, at least in the first instance, also satisfy the court that it was done with knowledge of the voidability of the principal act and with the intention of confirming. Baudry-Lacantinerie, Des Oblig. III., No. 2010; 6 Larombi\u00e8re (1885), art, 1338, No. 37, p. 346; 4 Aubry & Rau, 1902, p. 439, n. 22.\nThe burden of establishing knowledge by the obligor or debtor of all facts essential to confirmation always rests upon the obligee or creditor, Fuzier-Herman, Rep. Vbo. Confirmation, No. 172.\nThe inference of knowledge of voidability must be of actual knowledge and not merely of constructive knowledge through being put upon inquiry and having possession of the means of acquiring actual knowledge, 18 Laurent, 630; 7 Rolland des Villargues, Notariat, Vbo. Ratification, No. 63-4; Fuzier-Herman, Rep. Vbo. Confirmation, No. 132; Dalloz (1856), 1, 292. Compare Allcard v. Skinner[5], per Lindley L.J. at p. 188, and per Bowen L.J. at pp. 192-3. In eases of doubt neither the inference of knowledge of voidability nor that of intention to forego the right of rescission will be drawn. 2 Solon, op. cit., No. 421; 2 Bedarride, Trait\u00e9 du Dol, No. 598. Moreover there must be actual execution; partial execution, however, will suffice, 4 Aubry, & Rau, 1902, p. 442, No. 26; but not a mere expression of intention to execute nor mere conservatory or other equivocal acts, 29 Demolombe 778; 6 Larombi\u00e8re, art. 1338, No. 35; 2 Bedarride, No. 600; Fuzier-Herman, R\u00e9p. Vbo. Confirmation, Nos. 155-165. Compare Morrison v. The Universal Marine Ins. Co.[6].\nIt must always be borne in mind, however, that mistake in law affords a ground for relief, under the Civil Codes of France and Quebec where it would not avail under English law: art. 1047 C.C.; 20 Laurent, No. 354; 13 Duranton, No. 682; 10 ibid. No. 127; Bain v. The City of Montreal[7].\nI propose now to consider slightly more in detail the contention of the respondent, doubtfully raised in her supplementary answer, but strongly urged at bar, that the acts relied upon do not import confirmation because, though fully apprised of the facts, she was ignorant of her legal rights, and the finding, which she has secured in the provincial courts, that those acts were not voluntary.\nThe plaintiff's knowledge at the time she performed the alleged acts of confirmation, of the facts upon which her right of rescission depends is affirmatively established by admissions of herself and her associates. When the options were given and the November payment was made they were fully apprised of the fraudulent deception on which they now rely to avoid their contract.\nThe requisites of an effectual confirmation may be established by presumptions as well as by direct testimony. These presumptions may be founded on the nature of the vice or defect in the principal obligation and the character of the act preferred as confirmation. 4 Aubry & Rau (1902), s. 337, No. 22; 5 Marcad\u00e9 (7 \u00e9d.), Art. 1338, s. 5, No. 4; 2 Solon, Th\u00e9orie de la Nullit\u00e9, No. 414 et seq. On this point Larombi\u00e8re says (vol. 6, art. 1338, No. 39):\u2014\nDu reste, les tribunaux peuvent r\u00e9soudre par l'appr\u00e9ciation des circonstances, les deux questions relatives, soit \u00e0 la connaissance du vice, soit \u00e0 l'intention de le r\u00e9parer.\nLa nature du vice qui entache l'obligation ou de l'execution volontaire qu'on oppose comme confirmation peut servir elle-m\u00eame \u00e0 les r\u00e9soudre. Tel est le cas o\u00f9, le vice \u00e9tant personnel et apparent, celui qui confirme ne peut, avec apparence de raison pr\u00e9texter cause d'ignorance, et o\u00f9 les actes d'ex\u00e9cution sont tellement \u00e9nergiques et caract\u00e9ris\u00e9s, qu'il est impossible d'admettre qu'il n'ait pas eu l'intention de purger et de couvrir tous vices quelconques, en pleine et enti\u00e8re connaissance.\nWhether knowledge of voidability will be presumed or inferred depends upon the nature of the facts of which it appears that the obligor was cognisant, i.e., whether they are such that a person knowing them would be likely to be aware of the consequent right of rescission, Dalloz, 1853, 2, 223. The presumption of the intention to confirm will likewise depend upon the degree of significance which attaches to the act of execution, 29 Demolombe, No. 774. Laurent, Vol. 18, No. 620, says that execution by a person having capacity to renounce the right of rescission, with knowledge of the vice' or defect which gives him that right, necessarily implies the intention to confirm. See also 2 Solon, op. cit. Nos. 415, 418, 420; Rolland de Villargues, Notariat, Vbo. Ratification, art. 3, No. 58. That such fraud as the plaintiff was fully informed had been practised in this case renders a contract affected by it voidable and gives a right of rescission to the party thus imposed upon are consequences so well known that it is scarcely conceivable that the plaintiff and her associates were ignorant of them. Such knowledge is properly presumed (2 Bedarride, Trait\u00e9 du Dol, No. 603. Compare Carter v. Silber[8]; Carnell v. Harrison[9]), if not conclusively, as it should be in the opinion of M. Bedarride, at least until lack of it is satisfactorily shewn. That such an act of execution of his obligation as voluntary payment to his creditor by the debtor cognizant of its voidability imports an election to accept that obligation and to forego the right of rescission is the view held by all the text writers of repute. While any act implying intention to renounce the right of rescission will, if unequivocal, suffice as confirmation (18 Laurent, 623; 4 Aubry & Rau, p. 443, n. 31, b., t., & q; Dalloz, 1887, 1, 228: compare Clough v. London & North Western Rly. Co. Ltd.[10]), Demolombe (vol. 29, No. 780) says:\u2014\nl'ex\u00e9cution, proprement dite, d'une convention consiste pour le d\u00e9biteur dans le paiement de ce qu'il doit.\nSee, too, 4 Aubry & Rau, 1902, p. 442, par. (a); 2 Solon, op. cit. No. 427; 18 Laurent, No. 624, Pineau v. La Compagnie Neigette[11]; Fuzier-Herman, Rep. Vbo. Confirmation, Nos. 117, .140. We have in the present case this typical act of implied confirmation. Comp. Webb v. Roberts[12]; Ex parte Shearman[13].\nAlthough some acts of execution accompanied by a clear (Fuzier-Herman, Rep. Vbo. Confirmation, No. 142, compare Mutual Reserve Life Ins. Co. v. Foster[14]), protest and reservation of rights will not amount to confirmation, the intention to confirm may be so unmistakably involved in the act itself that the most formal and explicit protest cannot avail; Journal du Palais, 1829, vol. 22, 2nd Part., p. 1287; 18 Laurent 637; 8 Huc, No. 275; Aubry & Rau, 1902, p. 442, n. 25; 2 Solon, op. cit. No. 436; 2 Bedarride, No. 609; Baudry-Lacantinerie, Des Oblig. III. No. 2005 (2). Here we have payment with presumed, if not actual, knowledge of the voidability of the obligation and without protest or reservation of any kind\u2014a precaution (if it could be effectual), of which the absence is not adequately explained by the suggested lack of professional advice. Bain v. City of Montreal[15]. The very fact of making a protest would involve an admission that the obligor knew of the voidability of the obligation and that her act of payment was of a nature implying an intention to confirm.\nThe presumption of intention to confirm arising from dealing with the property as owner\u2014giving options upon it or creating exclusive agencies to sell it \u2014is in English law equally as strong as that arising from payment. In Vigers v. Pike[16], Lord Cottenham said:\u2014\nIn a case depending upon alleged misrepresentation as to the nature and value of the thing purchased the defendant cannot adduce more conclusive evidence or raise a more effectual bar to the plaintiff's case than by shewing that the plaintiff was from the beginning cognizant of all the matters complained of or, after full information concerning them, continued to deal with the property. * * * As parties to these transactions and cognizant of the facts during the time they were acting upon the arrangement now complained of, using and appropriating the property they derived under it, they were precluded from asking any relief to which they might otherwise have been entitled, I confine my observations to the part of the relief which prays the rescinding of the transactions. See, too, Campbell v. Fleming[17]; Ex parte Briggs[18]. Compare Baudry-Lacantinerie, Des Oblig. III. No. 1991 (a); 29 Demolombe, No. 782, and 6 Larombi\u00e8re, art. 1338, No. 44.\nIn English law we are familiar with these presumptions. Indeed English jurists are perhaps in some cases inclined to regard them as conclusive more readily than the French. Instances have just been referred to. Others are to be found in such cases as Carter v. Silber[19]; Carnell v. Harrison[20]; Seddon v. North Eastern Salt Co.[21]; Croft v. Lumley[22].\nNo doubt there are several leading text writers who incline to the view that notwithstanding the presumption in favour of confirmation which arises from acts such as we are dealing with, where the voidability of the obligation is obvious from facts known to the obligor, a bare allegation in his plea that he was ignorant of the legal effect of those facts upon his obligation, or of his right to rescission, or of the confirmatory operation of his own subsequent acts, casts upon the obligee the burden of proving by positive testimony that the obligor was in fact fully cognizant of all these matters. 18 Laurent, 632, 3;. 650-1, 2; Baudry-Lacantinerie, Des Oblig. III. No. 2111. I am, with respect, unable to accept that view. It would render the establishment of tacit or implied confirmation impracticable. The reasoning of the writers who uphold the contrary opinion (4 Aubry & Rau, 1902, p. 440, n. 23; 6 Larombi\u00e8re, Art. 1338, No. 38; 2 Bedarride, Trait\u00e9 du Dol, No. 603; Fuzier-Herman, Rep. Vbo. Confirmation, Nos. 136, 137, 177) commends itself to my judgment and is, I think, more in harmony with the view taken by the Judicial Committee in the Brunet Case[23]. M. Solon (2 No. 415, p. 375 to No. 420, p. 383) would preclude the obligee in cases of apparent or patent voidability from setting up error of law in answer to a plea of confirmation. He will not be allowed to prove that he was unaware of the voidability unless he can shew some error of fact. But it is otherwise in cases of concealed or latent voidability.\nIn the foot-note to the report of Lenoble v. Lenoble in Sirey, 1860, p. 35, we find the following:\u2014\nL'ex\u00e9cution d'un acte nul peut avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 consentie dans des circonstances et dans des termes tels que La preuve de la connaissance de la nullit\u00e9 paraisse en ressortir; c'est alors \u00e0 celui qui pr\u00e9tend que cette connaissance n'existait pas \u00e0 prouver son all\u00e9gation, surtout quand il s'agit d'une nullit\u00e9 de droit, comme celle dont se trouvait vici\u00e9e la donation attaqu\u00e9e dans l'esp\u00e8ce. Il peut arriver, au contraire, que rien n'indique que la cause de nuilit\u00e9 ait \u00e9t\u00e9 connue de celui qui a ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 l'acte nul; et alors, c'est \u00e0 celui qui pr\u00e9tend qu'il y a ratification \u00e0 prouver que la ratification a eu lieu avec connaissance de la cause de nuilit\u00e9.\nIn English jurisprudence the line between mistake in law and mistake in fact is not so clearly and sharply drawn in equity as at common law: Daniell v. Sinclair[24]. But see. Stanley Bros. Ltd. v. Corporation of Nuneaton[25]. A mistake in regard to a legal right dependent upon the doubtful construction of a grant or will, or having an obscure or uncertain legal foundation, will be a ground for relief in equity (Earl Beauchamp v. Winn[26]; Livesey v. Livesey[27]; McCarthy v. Decaix[28]), while ignorance of the legal consequences of known facts dependent upon a well-established rule of law will not (Carnell v. Harrison[29]; Midland Great Western Rly. Co. v. Johnson[30]; Worrall v. Jacob[31]; Harriman v. Cannon[32]) unless it is so gross as to warrant an inference of imbecility, surprise, or blind and credulous confidence calling for the protective intervention of a Court of Equity (Story's Equity, 2nd Eng. ed., ss. 122, 124, 128), or is accompanied by other circumstances affording equitable grounds on which relief should be granted. Rogers v. Ingram[33]. (But see criticism of the distinction between well-known and other rules of law, in Story's Equity, 2nd Eng. ed., ss. 126-7, where it is suggested that a distinction between action taken in entire ignorance of title or right and action when there is doubt or controversy rests on more solid foundation.) It may be necessary in some cases of private rights of the class dealt with in Beauchamp v. Winn[34], to prove affirmatively that the party alleged to have confirmed a voidable obligation had actual knowledge of his rights (Cockerell v. Cholmeley[35]); but ordinarily the presumption is that every person is acquainted with his own rights. (Story, 2nd Eng. ed., sec. 111; Lindsay Petroleum Co. v. Hurd[36]; La Banque Jacques Cartier v. La Banque D'Epargne de la Cit\u00e9 et du District de Montreal[37]).\nSuch mistakes are not commonly easy of clear proof and courts of equity, in assuming to correct alleged mistakes, must of necessity require the very clearest proof, lest they create errors in attempting to correct them. There is, too, great opportunity for the practice of fraud through alleged mistakes of law, when courts listen readily to such grounds (Story, 2nd Eng. ed., s. 138a).\nAssuming, as is the view of MM. Laurent and Baudry-Lacantinerie, that the presumption juris et de jure that everybody knows the law exists only in regard to matters of public interest and does not ordinarily apply to matters of merely private right (compare Cooper v. Phibbs[38]), knowledge of private rights, as a presumption of fact, may and should be inferred where, as here, the circumstances are such that an ordinary man of the world would have been aware of those rights. (Carnell v. Harrison[39]). When with that knowledge an obligor does an act in fulfilment of a voidable obligation of a nature which ordinarily implies an intention to accept the obligation and to forego any right of cancellation or rescission (the payment made by Mme. Sarault and the options given to Mme. Bouthillier and the Charruau Realty Co. were undoubtedly such acts), the intention to confirm should also be inferred. In some cases these inferences may be so cogent that an assertion of error in law made to rebut them will not be tolerated. But the weight of authority favours the view that to an alleged confirmation error of law may usually be set up as an answer, though proof of it lies upon the person alleging it and may be very difficult.\nAs Demolombe puts it (vol. 29, No. 775):\u2014\nA supposer maintenant que le d\u00e9biteur puisse fournir la preuve que l'erreur de droit, dans laquelle il \u00e9tait, a eu pour r\u00e9sultat d'emp\u00eacher l'effet confirmatif de l'ex\u00e9cution de l'obligation, du moins est-il n\u00e9cessaire qu'il la fournisse.\nSee, too, Bedarride, No. 603; Fuzier-Herman Rep. Vbo. \"Confirmation,\" No. 130; Bain v. City of Montreal[40].\nAs already pointed out it is very doubtful whether the plaintiff has in her pleading alleged error of law on her part. It is certainly impossible from her answer to the defendant's supplementary plea to determine in what respect she has alleged that she was ignorant whether of the legal consequences of fraud, of her right of rescission, or of the confirmatory effect of the acts now invoked against her. There is really no evidence that she was not fully informed as to all these matters and there is nothing to shew that her conduct was determined by any mistake as to her legal rights. Stone v. Godfrey[41]. Under these circumstances the contention that what she did does not amount to confirmation because of error of law on her part, in my opinion, fails.\nThe evidence in support of the finding that the alleged confirmatory acts were not voluntary is very slight indeed. In view of the proof that the facts as to the fraud of the defendant were fully known to the plaintiff and the presumption of her knowledge of the voidability of her contract and of\" her consequent legal rights (Fuzier-Herman, Rep. Vbo. Confirmation, No. 119; 18 Laurent, 631-3; 8 Huc., 274) and of the undoubtedly confirmatory character of her subsequent acts, the only aspect of voluntary execution still to be considered is whether the plaintiff was subject to such pressure that in doing the alleged acts of confirmation she acted under constraint and therefore not voluntarily.\nNo action to compel payment was brought either against the plaintiff or against any of her associates: nor was any such action threatened. The secretary of the defendant company merely telephoned to the plaintiff notifying her that her second payment was due. She asked him to call at her house and upon his doing so, without complaint or protest, gave him her cheque dated the 22nd November, 1912, for $148, the amount for which he asked. The fraud had then been fully known for some time. It had been considered at more than one meeting of the syndicate. At these meetings the deception practised was discussed and at one of them Mme. Bessette, a sub-agent of the defendant, and MM. Langelier and Beauchemin, its agents, who were present, were charged with the deceit of which the purchasers complained. The chief purpose of these meetings, however, seems to have been to consider the possibility of selling the property on terms which would be profitable or would at least save the members of the syndicate from loss. At one of them Isaie Denis, a member of the syndicate, tells us that, in reply to Mme. Bessette who urged them to hold out for $25,000 (their purchase price had been $16,600), he said:\u2014\nIf you can find $20,000, sell as fast as you can.\nMme. Casavant, another member, speaking of the third meeting of the syndicate held at the residence of M. Denis, on the 3rd October, 1912, says that it was called to discuss the best means of getting rid of the lands as quickly as possible; that Mme. Bouthillier was urged to undertake the sale of the property, that she was unwilling to do so, but that she finally yielded to the pressure of the members of the syndicate and accepted a written option or authorisation to sell as agent which the members of the syndicate signed. Mme. Bouthillier confirms these statements. When giving evidence several members of the syndicate denied having given this option. But when Mme. Bouthillier produced the document bearing their signatures they found themselves obliged to admit it. The plaintiff was one of the signatories. They had previously engaged Mme. Bessette to sell on their behalf. Pursuant to the mandate given her, Mme. Bouthillier, with the concurrence of members of the syndicate, on the 31st October, placed the property in the hands of the Charruau Realty Company with an exclusive right of sale. It is true that Mme. Sarault says in a vague and indefinite way that the reason she made the payment of $148 in November was because she feared that if she did not make it she would lose the $1,000 which she had already put into the property. But upon all the evidence it is, I think, reasonably clear that the members of the syndicate who had bought for speculation, although they knew they had a right of rescission, deliberately decided to hold the property in the hope of realising a profit by selling it and the plaintiff paid her second instalment rather for this reason than because of any duress or pressure due to the forfeiture clause in the contract. The suggestion of constraint seems to have been an afterthought.\nI am unable to find in the evidence proof of such pressure or constraint as would vitiate the acts of confirmation relied upon or would justify a court in finding that they were not performed voluntarily. Certainly pressure due to fear of litigation or of losing the money already invested was not the sole inducement for the giving of the agency or option to Mme. Bessette and afterwards to Mme. Bouthillier. The possibility of disposing of the property to advantage affected the action of the syndicate in taking both these steps.\nIn a number of the French authors we find it stated that the execution of an obligation cannot be considered voluntary where it has taken place in order to escape action or suit by the creditor (pour \u00e9chapper aux poursuites exerc\u00e9es par le cr\u00e9ancier). Aubry et Rau (1902) p. 443; 29 Demolombe, No. 777; Fuzier-Herman, Rep. Vbo. Confirmation, No. 154. Indeed Baudry-Lacantinerie (Des Oblig. III., No. 2005) says that \"moral pressure\" will suffice to render an act of execution involuntary,\" As an instance of such pressure, however, he gives an action or suit by the creditor.\nBedarride very forcefully and effectively combats the view that the mere threat, or even the actual institution by the creditor, of an action to compel performance, to which the debtor knows he has a complete defence (ex hypothesi that is the case here), can amount to such pressure or constraint as will render his execution of a voidable obligation ineffectual as confirmation. Trait\u00e9 du Dol II., No. 604-5. See, too, Bain v. City of Montreal[42].\nLarombi\u00e8re (vol. 6, art. 1338, No. 41), says:\u2014\n41. L'ex\u00e9cution doit enfin \u00eatre volontaire, c'est-\u00e0-dire qu'elle ne doit \u00eatre ni surprise par dol, ni arrach\u00e9e par violence, ni forc\u00e9e par les voies de droit. Elle ne serait pas volontaire si elle \u00e9tait entach\u00e9e de vices qui invalident le consentement, ou si elle n'avait eu lieu qu' \u00e0 la suite et en execution d'une poursuite judiciaire ou d'une contrainte l\u00e9gale, ou dans le seul but de s'y soustraire.\nSee also 8 Toullier, No. 512.\nPayment under or to escape process of law, is the typical instance of performance under legal compulsion. Short of this there may be constraint of law, or \"moral violence\" sufficient to destroy the freedom of consent or liberty of action essential to a voluntary act, Story's Equity (12 ed.), s. 239. But the mere presence of a forfeiture clause in an agreement known to be vitiated by fraud in my opinion cannot, at all events, in the absence of evidence that the obligor was ignorant of her legal position and rights, warrant the conclusion that such significant acts of execution as the payment of purchase money and dealing with the land under the contract in a manner consistent only with an affirmance of it, unaccompanied by protest or reservation of any sort, were done involuntarily. The peculiar position of Mme. Bessette, who, while acting as a paid sub-agent for the vendors, posed before the members of the syndicate as a fellow-purchaser, having interests with their own, might have afforded the plaintiff another ground for rescission. But she does not allege these facts in her declaration and, although evidence of them was given at the trial, they were not alluded to in the judgments either in the trial court or in the Court of King's Bench. Presumably in those courts, as here, they were not urged as entitling the plaintiff to relief. There is nothing to shew when the members of the syndicate first learned of Mme, Bessette's sub-agency. It may be that it was known to them when the confirmatory acts relied upon were done, and if so, it would, of course, be affected by those acts in the same way as the misrepresentations on which the plaintiff has based her claim.\nI am, for these reasons, with great respect, of the opinion that this appeal should be allowed with costs in this court and in the Court of King's Bench and that judgment should be entered for the defendant dismissing the action with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Perron, Taschereau, Rinfret, Vall\u00e9e & Genest.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Loranger, Loranger & Prud'homme.\n[1] Q.R. 24 K.B. 249.\n[2] [1909] A.C. 330 at page 339.\n[3] 2 Sch. & L. 474 at page 486.\n[4] 8 Ch.
