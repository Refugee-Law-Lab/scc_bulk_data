Some eighty-years ago, a wooden dam was built on this river; it was replaced in 1913 by a concrete dam about eight inches higher and was again raised another fourteen inches or so in 1928. The dam is owned by the respondent. The appellant claimed that, through the raising of the dam, his land was damaged by flood and by erosion; and asked that the respondent be condemned to pay the sum of one hundred and fifty dollars for damages caused during the two preceding years and, moreover, that the respondent be condemned to demolish his dam, on the ground that it had been raised illegally and without complying with the formalities required by the Watercourse Act (R.S.Q., 1925, c. 46). The respondent pleaded that he had acquired by prescription the right to flood the lands of the appellant; that the raising of the dam consisted merely in ordinary repairs and did not require compliance with the enactments of the Watercourse Act; that the raising of the dam did not bring the Etchemin river at a higher level than it had been previously raised when the dam was at its original height; that no damage had been caused to the appellant's land through the raising of the dam; and that, at all events, the whole matter was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Quebec Public Service Commission, and the Superior Court was not competent to hear and determine the case. The trial judge, Langlais J., dismissed the action on the ground that, in view of the provisions of the Watercourse Act, the Superior Court had no jurisdiction, which judgment was affirmed by a majority of the appellate court. Special leave to appeal to this Court was refused by the appellate court, and the appellant moved before this Court for special leave to appeal.\nHeld that the appellant's petition for special leave to appeal to this. Court ought to be granted.\nThe present case not only raises a \"question of law of great importance\" (Street v. Ottawa Valley Power Co. [1940] S.C.R. 40); but it concerns the whole working and operation of the Watercourse Act throughout the province of Quebec, and still more the ousting of the jurisdiction of His Majesty's courts on a point likely to arise frequently and of general application. Therefore it follows that the matter in controversy is of such general importance that leave ought to be granted, provided this Court has the required jurisdiction to grant it.\nThere is jurisdiction in this Court, as the matter in controversy comes within the provisions of section 41 of the Supreme Court Act: it may come under sub-paragraph (c), as being within the words \"other matters by which rights in future of the parties may be affected\"; but it clearly comes under paragraph (d): \"the title to real estate or some interest therein.\"\nComments as to the bearing of the decision of this Court in Hand v. Hampstead Land and Construction Co. ([1928] S.C.R. 428), where it was held that leave would not be granted to appeal from a judgment \"solely\" because it involved the construction of a provincial statute of a public nature. Generally speaking, a strictly municipal matter is of a somewhat local character and of restricted interest. In such a case, the matter in controversy, even if it does involve the interpretation of a provincial Act, may not always be found of such general interest and of such importance as to warrant the granting of special leave to appeal to this Court; but the decision in the Hand case is far from holding that, whenever the construction of a provincial statute is involved, ipso facto the matter in controversy will not be found of sufficient importance to justify the granting of special leave.\nHeld, also, as already decided by this Court in Canadian National Railway Co. v. Croteau and Cliche ([1925] S.C.R. 384) and in Hand v. Hampstead Land and Construction Co. ([1928] S.C.R. 428), that \"the highest court of final resort having jurisdiction in the province \"in which the judicial proceeding was originally instituted,\" exercising the authority to grant special leave to appeal to this Court under section 41 of the Supreme Court Act, is not limited by any rule \"supposed to be laid down in this Court touching the exercise \"of that jurisdiction.\" The granting of special leave to appeal to this Court by a provincial court of appeal, conferred by section 41, \"is untrammelled and free from restriction, save such as is implied \"in the term 'special leave'.\"\nMOTION for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada from a judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, Langlais J., and dismissing the appellant's action. The material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nAlleyn Taschereau K.C. and Arthur B\u00e9langer K.C. for the motion.\nEdgar Gosselin K.C. contra.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014This is a motion by the appellant for special leave to appeal under section 41 of the Supreme Court Act.\nThe appellant is the owner of some land on the Etchemin river, in the province of Quebec, and of an island in the same river,\nSome eighty years ago, a wooden dam was built on this river. It was replaced in 1913 by a concrete dam about eight inches higher. It was again raised another fourteen inches or so in 1928. The dam is owned by the defendant-respondent.\nThe appellant claimed that, through the raising of the dam, his land was damaged by flood and by erosion; and, in the conclusion of his declaration, he asked that the respondent be condemned to pay the sum of one hundred and fifty dollars for damages caused during the two preceding years; but, moreover, that the defendant be condemned to demolish his dam, on the ground that it had been raised illegally and without complying with the formalities required by the Watercourse Act (R.S.Q., 1925, c. 46).\nThe respondent pleaded that he had acquired by prescription the right to flood the lands of the appellant; that the raising of the dam consisted merely in ordinary repairs and did not require compliance with the enactments of the Watercourse Act; that the raising of the dam did not bring the Etchemin river at a higher level than it had been previously raised when the dam was at its original height; that no damage had been caused to the appellant's land through the raising of the dam; and that, at all events, the whole matter was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Quebec Public Service Commission, and the Superior Court was not competent to hear and determine the case. Langlais J., by whom the case was heard in the Superior Court at Quebec, dismissed the action on the ground that, in view of the provisions of the Watercourse Act, the Court had no jurisdiction.\nIn the Court of King's Bench (appeal side) the majority (Rivard, Bond and Barclay JJ.) were of the same opinion. They adopted the view of the trial judge and they confirmed his judgment on the ground of jurisdiction.\nL\u00e9tourneau J.A. was inclined to share the opinion of the majority so far as the ascertainment of damages was concerned; but he thought that the prayer for the demolition of the dam was within the competency of the Superior Court because, as he remarked, the conclusion of the appellant in his declaration was clearly based on the illegality of the construction on account of the fact that the respondent had not complied with the requirements of the Watercourse Act in failing to obtain the previous authorization and approval of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council (subs. 2 of s. 5 of the Act).\nHe proceeds, however, to inquire whether, in the premises, the mere raising of the dam did not come within s. 11 of the Act exempting from the necessity of previous approval by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council works constructed before the 9th of February, 1918.\nAfter having examined the evidence, he comes to the conclusion that \"une sur\u00e9l\u00e9vation, un changement dans la hauteur, n'est pas en soi la construction du barrage\". Accordingly, he expresses the opinion that the raising of the dam in this particular case was not that kind of work which required the authorization and the approval under the Act and that it cannot be said, in the circumstances, that the new work was illegal. For that reason, in his opinion, the appellant's prayer for the demolition should not be granted. So far as the damages were concerned, as already mentioned, he thought they came expressly under the jurisdiction of the Quebec Public Service Commission.\nAs for Galipeault J., he dissented from the majority, on the ground that the Superior Court was competent to assess and award the damages claimed by the appellant, and he would have allowed one hundred dollars for the two years preceding the introduction of the action. Although holding the view that the raising of the dam in 1928 was subject to s. 5 of the Watercourse Act and that this new construction was illegal, he was for reserving the appellant's right for its demolition in a subsequent action, if necessary (art. 1066 C.C.).\nThe appellant applied to the Court of King's Bench for special leave to appeal to this Court. This was refused on the ground that\nla permission demand\u00e9e n'est pas justifiee et qu'il n'y a pas lieu pour cette Cour de l'accorder.\nThere is no denying the fact that the matter in controversy is of such general importance that leave ought to be granted, if it can be shewn that this Court has the required jurisdiction to grant it.\nAt the outset, perhaps it would not be out of the way to reiterate that\nthe highest court of final resort having jurisdiction in the province in which the judicial proceeding was originally instituted,\nexercising the authority to grant special leave to appeal to this Court under s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act, is not limited by any rule\nsupposed to be laid down in this Court touching the exercise of that jurisdiction,\nas observed by the Chief Justice in Canadian National Railway Company v. Croteau & Cliche[1].\nThis court has no authority, and of course, never pretended to exercise any authority, to lay down rules restricting the scope of the jurisdiction or governing the exercise of the jurisdiction conferred by s. 41 upon provincial courts of appeal. The statute gives a discretion to such courts, and, where a statutory discretion is conferred upon a court, it is not within the authority of any other court to give directions as to the manner in which the discretion is to be exercised. Attorney-General v. Emerson[2].\nThe granting of special leave by the provincial court of appeal, conferred by s. 41, \"is untrammelled and free from restriction, save such as is implied in the term 'special leave'.\"\nIn support of the contention that the present petition for special leave ought not to be granted by this Court, the respondent relied on our decision in Hand v. Hampstead Land and Construction Company and The Town of Hampstead[3]. In that case, the point was whether a transfer of land was invalid on the ground that the consideration was illegal because in contravention of a provision of the municipal law of the province of Quebec. The Court of King's Bench had granted the conclusion of the plaintiff's action and had declared the transfer null and without effect.\nThis judgment no doubt involved the validity of the title to the land acquired by the municipality from the mis-en-cause Hand. Special leave to appeal from the adverse judgment of that Court had been refused by the Court of King's Bench, for the reason that\nthe only question of law was whether it was within the authority of a municipal council to acquire property from a ratepayer of the municipality for the consideration of granting to the ratepayer exemption from taxation on other property owned by the ratepayer within the municipality.\nUpon application to this Court for special leave to appeal, the judgment of the Court, delivered by Anglin C.J.C., decided that leave would not be granted to appeal from a judgment solely because it involved the construction of a provincial statute of a public nature. The emphasis here should be placed on the word \"solely,\" for the Chief Justice said:\nWe are not disposed to hold that every judgment of a provincial appellate court interpreting a statute of purely provincial application is per se of such general importance as to warrant the granting of special leave to appeal to this court * * * We think it was not the purpose of Parliament in providing for special leave to appeal to this court that every case of this type might be brought before it.\nGenerally speaking, of course, a strictly municipal matter is of a somewhat local character and of restricted interest. In such a case, the matter in controversy, even if it does involve the interpretation of a provincial Act, may not always be found of such general interest and of such importance as to warrant the granting of special leave to appeal to this Court. That is the ground upon which special leave was refused in the Hand case[4]; but the decision in that case is far from holding that, whenever the construction of a provincial statute is involved, ipso facto the matter in controversy will not be found of sufficient importance to justify the granting of special leave. This principle was applied in refusing leave, on June 17th, 1936, in St. Catharine's v. Hulse, and, on May 7th, 1940, in Harper v. City of St. Thomas, two judgments of this Court which have not been reported because it was not felt necessary.\nThe present case, however, is an instance of the contrary situation. Not only does it raise a \"question of law of great importance\" (Street et al. v. Ottawa Valley Power Company[5], but it concerns the whole working and operation of the Watercourse Act throughout the province of Quebec, and still more the ousting of the jurisdiction of His Majesty's courts on a point likely to arise frequently and of general application.\nThe question remains, however, whether the matter in controversy comes within one of the sub-paragraphs of section 41 of the Supreme Court Act.\nIt may come under sub-paragraph (c), as being within the words\nother matters by which rights in future of the parties may be affected.\nThe respondent does not indicate any intention of cutting down his dam to the level at which it was before 1928. On the contrary, not only does he show every intention of maintaining the dam at its present level, but he even contends that he has acquired by prescription the right to flood the appellant's lands, as he is at present doing. The damages which allegedly the dam causes to the appellant's lands are continuing damages. If they exist, which, of course, will have to be decided on the merits of the case, they will persist so long as the dam stands as it is.\nIt would seem that the appellant on this point could rightly rely on Christie v. The York Corporation[6].\nBut we think the appellant's case clearly comes under sub-paragraph (d) of sec. 41: \"the title to real estate or some interest therein.\"\nThe exercise by the respondent of the right to flood the appellant's property, by the raising of the level of Etchemin river through his dam, is a servitude established by law, having for its object public utility and that of the owners of mills or factories bordering on rivers or streams. It is a real servitude imposed as a charge on one real estate for the benefit of another belonging to a different proprietor (Arts. 499 & 503 C.C.; Planiol, Trait\u00e9 El\u00e9mentaire de Droit Civil, tome 1er, nos. 2880 & 2886; See what is said by the present Chief Justice in Gale v. Bureau[7]).\nThe appellant, in the present case, disputes the legal title of the respondent to the real servitude which he is exercising. The appellant contends that the respondent has not fulfilled the formalities and the conditions required for the purpose of acquiring a valid title to the servitude which he claims. That puts undoubtedly in controversy as between the parties the title to an interest in the real estate of the appellant; and on that ground there is jurisdiction in this Court to entertain the application for special leave to appeal.\nIf authority should be required for that proposition, it will be found in several cases in this Court, where jurisdiction was entertained (Blackford v. McBain[8]; Macdonald v. Ferdais[9]; Chamberlain v. Fortier[10] ; Berthier v. Denis[11]; Riou v. Riou[12]; Lafrance v. Lafontaine[13]; Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Perrault[14]; Audette v. O'Cain[15]; Cliche v. Roy[16]; Tanguay v. Canadian Electric Company[17]; King's Asbestos Mines v. South Thetford[18]; Thompson v. Simard[19].\nFor the above reasons, the petition for special leave ought to be granted, costs to follow the event.\nPetition granted costs to follow event.\n[1] [1925] S.C.R. 384, at 385.\n[2] (1889) 24 Q.B.D. 561, at pp. 58, 59.\n[3] [1928] S.C.H. 428.\n[4] [1928] S.C.R. 428.\n[5] [1940] S.C.R. 40.\n[6] [1939] S.C.R. 50.\n[7] (1910) 44 Can.

Respondent had provided in the year 1937 transportation by motor buses to and from said continuation school for pupils residing outside said school sections though in the County of Northumberland (called \u201ccounty pupils\u201d), and sought to hold liable the appellant, the Corporation of the United Counties of Northumberland and Durham, in respect of the cost of such transportation, as being part of the cost of educating such county pupils.\nHeld (Davis J. dissenting): Respondent Board was entitled to recover from appellant corporation payment in respect of said costs of transportation. (Judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, [1940] 2 D.L.R. 28, affirmed.)\nThe Continuation Schools Act, R.S.O., 1937, c. 359, particularly ss. 3 (2), 5, 8(1), 15; The Public Schools Act, R.S.O., 1937, c. 357, particularly ss. 94, 95, 86, 87, 89 (p); The High Schools Act, R.S.O., 1937, c. 360 (particularly, per Davis J., s. 24 (h), as amended in 1938, c. 35, s. 17), considered.\nDoubt expressed (per the Chief Justice and Kerwin and Taschereau JJ.) as to the right of the parties to have determined by action the above question of liability, in view of s. 36 (4) of The High Schools Act (as to determination by the Judge of the County Court), and as to the discretion under s. 15 (b) of the Ontario Judicature Act to make a mere declaratory judgment in this action; but in view of certain proceedings before action and the course of proceedings in the action, the appeal to this Court was (but without in any way creating a precedent) dealt with on the merits. (In the view of the merits taken by Davis J., dissenting, it became unnecessary to consider whether said s. 36 (4) of The High Schools Act precluded the Supreme Court of Ontario from entertaining an action for the declaration made by that Court.)\nAPPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] which reversed the judgment of Greene J.\nThe plaintiff, the Board of Public School Trustees of Union School Sections 16 and 18, Townships of Murray and Brighton, in Northumberland County, Ontario, had established and maintained a Grade B Continuation School within its Union School Sections. In the year 1937 the plaintiff Board provided transportation to and from its said continuation school for pupils residing in the County of Northumberland but not within said union school sections, who, being so resident, were \u201ccounty pupils\u201d as defined in s. 1 (b) of The Continuation Schools Act, R.S.O., 1937, c. 359. In this action the plaintiff sought a declaration that the cost of transporting county pupils to and from the said school was part of the cost of educating such county pupils, and to recover from the defendant, the Corporation of the United Counties of Northumberland and Durham, payment in respect of the cost of such transportation for the year 1937.\nGreene J. dismissed the action with costs. His judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeal for Ontario (Harrison J.A. dissenting)1 which by its formal judgment declared\nthat the cost of transportation of county pupils to and from the Continuation Grade B School maintained by the plaintiff is part of the cost of education of such county pupils to be paid by the defendant to the plaintiff and charged, levied and collected in the manner provided in sections 35, 36, 37 and 38 of The High Schools Act, being ch. 360, R.S.O., 1937.\nand directed that there be no order as to costs of the action or of the appeal.\nSpecial leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada (defendant undertaking not to ask for costs of such appeal against the plaintiff) was granted by the Court of Appeal for Ontario.\nD.L. McCarthy K.C. for the appellant.\nW.N. Tilley K.C. and John Callahan K.C. for the respondent. The judgment of the Chief Justice and Kerwin and Taschereau JJ. was delivered by\nKERWIN J.\u2014The appellant, the Corporation of the United Counties of Northumberland and Durham, in the Province of Ontario, was sued by the respondent, the Board of Public School Trustees, Union School Sections 16 and 18, Townships of Murray and Brighton. The action was dismissed by the trial judge but the Court of Appeal for Ontario, granting the relief sought by the respondent, declared\nthat the cost of transportation of county pupils to and from the Continuation Grade B School maintained by the plaintiff is part of the cost of education of such county pupils to be paid by the defendant to the plaintiff and charged, levied and collected in the manner provided in sections 35, 36, 37 and 38 of The High Schools Act, being ch. 360, R.S.O., 1937.\nBy special leave of the Court of Appeal, the Corporation of the United Counties now appeals.\nThe Townships of Murray and Brighton are situate in Northumberland, one of the United Counties. The respondent board was constituted under the provisions of The Public Schools Act and its powers in connection with the public school maintained by it may now be found in The Public Schools Act, R.S.O., 1937, chapter 357, and amendments. Under The Continuation Schools Acts in force from time to time, provision was made for the establishment of continuation schools. Pursuant to what is now subsection 1 of section 3 of The Continuation Schools Act, R.S.O., 1937, chapter 359, the respondent board established a Grade B Continuation School in its Union School Section and by subsection 2 of section 3, in respect of the maintenance of that school, it has all the powers conferred on it as a public school board. Maintenance is defined in The Continuation Schools Act but, in my opinion, has no bearing on the issue in dispute.\nBy section 5 of The Continuation Schools Act, no fees are payable by or in respect of a pupil attending the respondent\u2019s continuation school who is,\u2014\n(a) a pupil who resides or whose parent or guardian resides, or is assessed for an amount equal to the average assessment of the ratepayers in the municipality or school section by the board of which the school is established;\n(b) a pupil whose cost of education is payable under the provisions of section 8 either as a county pupil or otherwise. \u201cCounty pupils\u201d is defined in the Act and there is no doubt that such pupils attended the respondent\u2019s continuation school, that is, pupils outside the limits of those parts of the townships of Murray and Brighton included in Union School Sections 16 and 18 but still within Northumberland, one of the United Counties. The cost of education of those county pupils at the respondent\u2019s continuation school is, by virtue of subsection 1 of section 8 of The Continuation Schools Act, to be paid by the appellant to the respondent and charged, levied and collected in the manner provided in certain enumerated sections of The High Schools Act. There is no dispute as to the manner of working out this cost, based upon the total number of days\u2019 attendance of county pupils as compared with the total number of days\u2019 attendance of all pupils. What is in issue is whether an item of $1,176, representing the amount paid by the respondent board for transporting county pupils to and from its continuation school, was properly included in the total cost of education of all the pupils of the school.\nSection 15 of The Continuation Schools Act provides:\u2014\nSuch of the provisions of The Public Schools Act in the case of a continuation school under the jurisdiction of a public school board as are applicable and are not inconsistent with this Act, shall be read as part of this Act.\nSections 94 and 95 of The Public Schools Act read as follows:\u2014\n94. The board may provide for the transportation of pupils to and from a school maintained by it or which is used jointly by it and another board or other boards, and any payment made or any liability heretofore made or incurred for such purpose under agreement or otherwise is hereby validated and confirmed and declared to have been legally made or incurred.\n95. (1) The board of a section or municipality may provide for the transportation of pupils residing in the section or municipality, as the case may be, to and from a continuation, high or vocational school situate elsewhere which such pupils have the right by law to attend, and for the purpose may co-operate with any other board.\n(2) The cost of providing transportation under section 94 or this section shall be an expense to be included in the estimates for the current year.\nSubsection 1 of section 95 may be disregarded; it permits a public school board to provide for the transportation of pupils residing in its section to and from a continuation school situate elsewhere and is therefore not applicable to the respondent, which maintains a continuation school. Under section 94, however, the board of a public school section \u201cmay provide for the transportation of pupils to and from a school maintained by it or which is used jointly by it and another board or other boards.\u201d I agree with the Chief Justice of Ontario that there is nothing in The Public Schools Act, or elsewhere, which prohibits a public school board carrying on some of its functions or duties beyond the territorial limits of the section it serves. In addition to the examples given by him, the reference in section 94 to a school used jointly by a board with others would indicate that the transportation therein referred to would in that case necessarily extend beyond such limits. Again, as the Chief Justice points out, a public school board, under section 86 of The Public Schools Act, must in certain circumstances admit to its public school non-resident pupils. It is true that under section 87 special provision is made for the cost of transportation where there is no school in a rural school section but that might well be because of questions that would otherwise arise as to what expenditures the board of a rural section which maintained no school could incur.\nSection 94 is applicable to the respondent board and is not inconsistent with The Continuation Schools Act. With reference to its continuation school, the respondent may exercise the same powers as it has with respect to its public school, and by virtue of another applicable and not inconsistent provision (subsection 2 of section 95) the total cost of transportation thus properly incurred is \u201can expense to be included in the estimates for the current year.\u201d These are the estimates referred to in section 89 (p) of The Public Schools Act which must show \u201cany revenues estimated to be derived by the board during the current year from all sources.\u201d The item in question having been properly included in the total cost of education of all the pupils attending the school, it follows that under subsection 1 of section 8 of The Continuation Schools Act it represents part of the cost of education of county pupils to be paid by the appellant and charged, levied and collected in the manner indicated.\nI share the doubt expressed by the judges in the Court of Appeal as to the right of the parties to have determined by action the question of liability in view of the provisions of subsection 4 of section 36 of The High Schools Act, and also the doubt that the Court had a discretion under clause (b) of section 15 of the Ontario Judicature Act to make a mere declaratory judgment in this action. But, as pointed out by the Chief Justice of Ontario:\u2014\nNo objection was taken, either in the statement of defence or at the trial or on the argument in this Court to proceeding by way of action. It further appears that the County Judge, before action, had been asked to determine the dispute, but he thought he had no jurisdiction to do so, and this view seems to have been acquiesced in at the time by the respondent\u2019s solicitor. Without deciding one way or the other as to the jurisdiction of the county judge, it may be well, in view of the costs incurred and the very full and careful arguments that have been made, that this Court should make a declaration of the rights of the parties.\nThe appellant sought and was given leave to appeal from the decision of the Court of Appeal, and before us no question was raised by either party as to the right of the Ontario Courts or of this Court, to pronounce upon the matter.\nIt is under these circumstances and without in any way creating a precedent that this Court has undertaken the responsibility of deciding whether the Court of Appeal\u2019s order was correct or not. We are of opinion that it was right. The appeal should be dismissed but without costs.\nDAVIS J. (dissenting)\u2014This appeal involves the interpretation of what I venture to call mutatis mutandis legislation\u2014legislation by reference is, I think, the common and perhaps the more accurate expression\u2014and presents, as such legislation usually does, vexatious and quite unnecessary difficulties. If a legislature does not see fit to express itself in clear and simple language but prefers to adopt the objectionable course of making so much of another statute as is \u201capplicable\u201d and \u201cnot inconsistent with\u201d a particular statute to be \u201cpart of\u201d the particular statute, the applicability and the consistency ought to be very plain.\nThe respondent is the Board of Trustees of a continuation school having a definite area within, but covering a portion only of, the United Counties of Northumberland and Durham in the Province of Ontario. It provided transportation by motor buses for pupils who resided outside the school section but within the boundaries of the United Counties and now seeks to include the cost of such transportation as one of the items of the cost of the school, a portion of which cost is chargeable against the United Counties. The United Counties, appellants, refused to accept this position. They say that, whether the continuation school had power or not to transport pupils from outside the school section to and from the school, there is no statutory authority to impose the cost, or any part of the cost, upon the counties either as part of the cost of education or as part of the cost of maintenance of the school.\nIn the case of high schools the legislation in this connection is explicit. By sec. 24 (h) of The High Schools Act (R.S.O., 1937, ch. 360, as amended in 1938 by 2 George VI, ch. 35, sec. 17), it shall be the duty of every board of high school trustees and it shall have power\nto provide, where the board deems it expedient, for the transportation of resident pupils, and with the approval of the Minister, of county pupils, attending high school * * * and to pay for such transportation out of any funds available for the maintenance of the high school.\nThis statutory provision introduced in 1926 (ch. 67, sec. 6) only referred to resident pupils until the amendment in 1938 expressly extended the duty and power of high school trustees to county pupils, provided that in their case the board obtained the approval of the Minister of Education.\nThe Continuation Schools Act, R.S.O., 1937, ch. 359, says nothing whatever about the transportation of pupils to and from a continuation school\u2014nothing about transportation of pupils who reside within the school section or of pupils who reside outside the school section. But the school board relies upon sec. 15 of the statute, which reads as follows:\n15. Such of the provisions of The Public Schools Act in the case of a continuation school under the jurisdiction of a public school board as are applicable and are not inconsistent with this Act, shall be read as part of this Act.\nThat section was added as sec. 14 by an amendment to the statute passed in 1932 by sec. 16 of ch. 42 of the Statutes of that year. In the same amending statute, by sec. 13 thereof, the following section (now sec. 95 of the present Act) was added to The Public Schools Act: 92a. (1) The board of a section or municipality may provide for the transportation of pupils residing in the section or municipality, as the case may be, to and from a continuation, high or vocational school situate elsewhere which such pupils have the right by law to attend, and for the purpose may co-operate with any other board.\n(2) The cost of providing transportation under section 92 or this section shall be an expense to be included in the estimates for the current year.\nThat provision plainly deals with transportation of pupils \u201cresiding in\u201d a school section or municipality to and from a continuation, high or vocational school \u201csituate elsewhere.\u201d Even if this provision be read as part of The Continuation Schools Act, I cannot see that it confers any duty or power upon a continuation school board to transport to and from their school, at the expense or partial expense of the county, pupils who do not reside in the school section but reside elsewhere within the larger area of the county. I cannot see any occasion for twisting and turning a section of one statute in an attempt to make it applicable to another.\nSection 94 of The Public Schools Act (it was sec. 92 at the date of the 1932 amendment above referred to) was also invoked as applicable and not inconsistent with The Continuation Schools Act. That section, which has been in The Public Schools Act since 1925, reads as follows:\n94. The board may provide for the transportation of pupils to and from a school maintained by it or which is used jointly by it and another board or other boards, and any payment made or any liability heretofore made or incurred for such purpose under agreement or otherwise is hereby validated and confirmed and declared to have been legally made or incurred.\nThat section is dealing with public school pupils attending a public school. It is contended that you unreasonably confine sec. 94 when you take it away from the context of sec. 86 which provides for the admission to the school of any non-resident pupil if the inspector reports in writing to the parent and to the secretary of the board affected that the accommodation is sufficient for the admission of such pupil and that the school is more accessible for him than the school in the section or urban municipality in which the pupil resides. But sec. 86 is known to have a very limited application for exceptional cases in public school attendance. Here again I do not think that sec. 94 is applicable to continuation schools to the extent of justifying a continuation school board charging against the county the expense of transporting pupils from all over the county to its particular school. At any rate, I am not prepared to grope my way through the numerous sections of The Public Schools Act in an attempt to justify the creation of the liability sought to be imposed by a local continuation school section against the whole county on the basis of legislation by reference. If legislation is desirable to accomplish what is sought, it can be easily and simply formulated and enacted by the legislature.\nIn this view of the matter, it becomes unnecessary to consider whether or not the provision of sec. 36 (4) of The High Schools Act, R.S.O., 1937, ch. 360, that where the council of a county and the board of a high school attended by county pupils from such county are unable to agree upon the sum to be paid for the cost of education of county pupils, the matter shall be referred to the judge of the county court for such county \u201cwho shall determine such sum,\u201d precludes the Supreme Court of Ontario from entertaining an action for such a declaration as was made by the Court of Appeal in this case.\nThe appeal, in my opinion, should be allowed, the judgment below set aside and the judgment at the trial restored. As the appellant, as a condition of obtaining leave to appeal, undertook not to ask for costs against the respondent of the appeal to this Court, there should be no costs of the appeal. But I should give the appellant its costs in the courts below.\nHUDSON J.\u2014I agree that this appeal should be dismissed without costs.\nAppeal dismissed without costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Frederick Desmond Boggs.\nSolicitors for the respondent: John Callahan & Co.\n[1] [1940] 2 D.L.R. 28.\n",

At the time of the fire it was being used by appellant\u2019s friend, R. (who, as found by the trial judge, had taken it without appellant\u2019s knowledge but in pursuance of a vague general consent to use it), to take (without remuneration) R.\u2019s uncle to a part of the lake where the uncle was to inspect a mine for his own benefit (the yacht was not hired or chartered either by R. or his uncle). About a month before the fire, one C. on two occasions had used the yacht to convey C.\u2019s workman across the lake for the purpose of filling C.\u2019s boom with logs, had tied up the yacht there, worked for about four hours logging, and then brought the workman back in the yacht. (As found by the trial judge, this was done without appellant\u2019s knowledge, but C. had appellant\u2019s general permission to use the yacht; its said use by C. had nothing to do with its loss). Appellant sued to recover under the policy. His action was dismissed by the trial judge, who found breach of appellant\u2019s warranty in R.\u2019s use of the yacht at the time of its destruction, and in C.\u2019s use of it as above stated. An appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario was dismissed, and appellant appealed to this Court.\nHeld: There was no breach of warranty, and appellant was entitled to recover.\nPer the Chief Justice and Crocket and Davis JJ.: A \u201cstrict though reasonable construction\u201d (Provincial Ins. Co. v. Morgan, [1933] A.C. 240, at 253-4) of the marginal endorsement is to treat the words \u201cnot to be hired or chartered\u201d as set in apposition to, and declaring the meaning of, the words \u201csolely for private pleasure purposes.\u201d The evidence showed that appellant\u2019s intention was that the yacht would be used solely for private pleasure purposes and that became in fact its normal use; there was no intention to hire or charter it, and it was never hired or chartered during the currency of the policy.\nPer Rinfret, Crocket and Kerwin JJ.: In construing the policy, the marginal statement should not be read as a condition that the policy would be avoided upon the yacht being used for other than private pleasure purposes even though at the time a loss was suffered it was not being so used (Provincial Ins. Co. v. Morgan, [1933] A.C. 240, affirming [1932] 2 K.B. 70. Judgment of Scrutton L.J. in [1932] 2 K.B., at 79, 80, particularly referred to). As to the use of the yacht at the time of the fire: The word \u201cprivate\u201d in the marginal statement must be read in conjunction with the words \u201cand not to be hired or chartered unless approved and permission endorsed hereon\u201d; and so read, the \u201cpleasure purposes\u201d may be private even when the yacht was used by R. with appellant\u2019s implied permission; and the use by R. in question was such as was within the words \u201cprivate pleasure purposes.\u201d\nPer Rinfret, Crocket and Kerwin JJ.: The contract was not a policy of fire insurance within the meaning of the Ontario Insurance Act, R.S.O., 1937, c. 256, and it was not subject to Part IV (and the statutory conditions therein) of that Act; the contract was one of insurance against losses incident to marine adventure, and the policy was one of marine insurance. Secs. 23(1), 1(39), 1(30), 102 (1), of said Act considered.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissing his appeal from the judgment of Urquhart J. dismissing his action for recovery of $1,500 and interest under an insurance policy issued by the defendant upon appellant\u2019s motor yacht which, within the period covered by the policy, was destroyed by fire. The material facts of the case and the questions before this Court are sufficiently stated in the reasons for judgment now reported and are indicated in the above head-note. Special leave to appeal to this Court was granted by the Court of Appeal for Ontario.\nT.J. Agar K.C. for the appellant.\nJ.D. Watt and J.C. Osborne for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Davis J. was delivered by\nDAVIS J.\u2014The respondent company insured the appellant against loss of a motor boat owned by him. The policy was for $1,500 and the annual premium was $71.25. The boat became a total loss by fire during the currency of the policy. The appellant made claim under the policy; the respondent refused to pay the claim; hence this action. One defence was that the appellant had fraudulently over-valued the boat in his application for the policy; another defence was fraudulent over-valuation in the proof of loss. These defences were not pressed before us in view of the evidence and the findings of the trial judge. A third ground of defence, and it prevailed at the trial, was that the policy contained a warranty and that a breach of that warranty had occurred and avoided the policy. Urquhart J., who tried the case, found a breach of warranty but said that the appellant was entirely innocent in the matter and that the respondent had taken too narrow a view of its liability under the policy but he said he felt compelled on the law to decide in favour of the respondent and he therefore dismissed the action without costs.\nThe appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario. That Court dismissed the appeal without any written reasons and then, by a subsequent order, granted the appellant special leave to appeal to this Court, the amount involved being less than $2,000. There were no written reasons for the latter order either, and this Court is now in the unfortunate position of not having the advantage of the reasons which led the Court of Appeal to dismiss the appeal from the judgment at the trial or of the reasons which led that Court to grant further leave to appeal.\nThe words endorsed in the margin of the policy and relied upon by the respondent read as follows:\nWarranted by the insured that the within named yacht shall be used solely for private pleasure purposes and not to be hired or chartered unless approved and permission endorsed hereon.\nThe motor boat at the time of the fire was being used by a friend of the appellant, one Racicot, to take his uncle up to another part of the lake (the lake on which the boat was usually used) to a dam where the uncle was to inspect a mine for his own benefit. The trial judge found that Racicot had taken the boat without the knowledge of the appellant but in pursuance of a vague general consent to use the boat. It is not suggested by the respondent that the boat was hired or chartered by Racicot. This incident was one of two grounds upon which the trial judge found that there had been a breach of the warranty. The other ground was the use of the boat on occasions by one Cryderman. Cryderman had built the boat for the appellant and the appellant admitted that Cryderman might use it whenever he wanted to, without asking permission. Cryderman testified that on two occasions about a month before the burning of the boat, having a boom at the other side of the lake, he took an employee of his across the lake in the boat for the purpose of filling the boom with logs belonging to him which were at or near the shore; that he tied the boat up there; worked for about four hours logging; and then brought his workman back home in the boat. The trial judge found that this had nothing to do with the loss of the boat by fire\u2014that it was in fact a month or more previous thereto\u2014and that it was done without the knowledge of the appellant. The appellant testified that he had heard rumours that Cryderman had used the boat to tow logs and that he went up to where the logs were and made inquiries and found, as he thought, that Cryderman was not using the boat for that purpose; his fears were allayed and he did nothing further about it. The trial judge referred to the appellant as a man \u201cwho appears to be a simple sort of man\u201d and said:\nHe did not think, I presume, that the slight use of the boat by Cryderman in conveying a workman across the water to go to work would be a breach of the warranty. I do not suppose, as a matter of fact that he ever gave that point a thought.\nBut the trial judge concluded that although Cryderman\u2019s use of the boat was antecedent in time and in no way connected with the loss of the boat\u2014\u201cmerely taking it across the lake, and tying it up\u201d\u2014nevertheless it was, in his opinion, a breach of the warranty. The trial judge put his judgment upon two distinct grounds, (1) Racicot\u2019s use of the boat at the time of its destruction, and (2) Cryderman\u2019s use of the boat on the occasions mentioned when he conveyed his workman and himself to the boom of logs.\nThere was evidence that the appellant had used the boat commercially on a few occasions, receiving in all about $15, once from a tourist and at other times taking parties to the blueberries, but the trial judge accepted the appellant\u2019s statement that these occasions were before he had taken out the insurance on the boat and did not occur afterwards. There was also some evidence that Cryder- man had used the boat for hauling logs across the lake and had been paid for this work but the trial judge disbelieved this evidence. There was also evidence that Cryderman on two occasions had taken a Dr. McCullough from Sudbury when Dr. McCullough\u2019s boat had broken down and that the doctor had paid for the gasolene, but the trial judge said he was not inclined to find that on those occasions the boat was not being used solely for private pleasure purposes.\nThe statement endorsed in the margin of the policy was of a promissory nature and was in apt language to create a warranty or a condition. It is clear law, said Lord Wright in the House of Lords in Provincial Insurance Co. v. Morgan[1], that a warranty or condition, \u201cthough it must be strictly complied with, must be strictly though reasonably construed.\u201d That leaves the essential problem to be what is the exact scope of the language used. As Lord Haldane said in Dawsons\u2019 case[2], the question which really lies at the root of the matter in dispute is one of construction simply, or, as Lord Buckmaster said in the Morgan case[3], the question on this appeal depends upon the true construction of the policy of insurance. In my opinion, a strict though reasonable construction of the marginal endorsation is to treat the words \u201cnot to be hired or chartered\u201d as set in apposition to the words \u201csolely for private pleasure purposes,\u201d the latter words in the document declaring the meaning of the former words. The evidence shows that the appellant\u2019s intention was that the boat would be used solely for private pleasure purposes and that that became in fact the normal use of the boat. There was no intention to hire or charter it, and on the evidence the boat was never hired or chartered during the currency of the policy.\nI would allow the appeal, set aside the judgments below and direct judgment to be entered for the appellant (plaintiff) as of the 2nd day of November, 1939, for the full amount of his claim with interest from the 25th day of June, 1938, with costs throughout. The judgment of Rinfret and Kerwin JJ. was delivered by\nKERWIN J.\u2014The respondent insurance company issued to the appellant a policy of insurance covering his motor yacht Silver Foam and its tackle, apparel, etc. By the policy, it was warranted by the insured that the yacht would be confined to Lake Wanapitei (an Ontario inland lake) and tributary waters. The adventures and perils which the company took upon itself\nare of the seas and waters, as hereinabove described, thieves (but against theft of the entire yacht only), fires, collisions, jettisons, salvage and general average charges, and all other similar marine perils, losses and misfortunes that have or shall come to the hurt, detriment or damage of said yacht or any part thereof, during the life of this Policy.\nOn November 2nd, 1937, during the period covered by the policy, the boat and its equipment were destroyed by fire on Lake Wanapitei. Suit was brought by the appellant to recover the sum of $1,500, at which amount the yacht, etc., was valued by the policy. For reasons to be mentioned later, the trial judge dismissed the action and an appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario was dismissed without reasons being given. By leave of that Court, the present appeal is now before us.\nThe appellant contends that the contract was a policy of fire insurance within the meaning of the Ontario Insurance Act, R.S.O., 1937, c. 256, or, at any rate, as it included fire risks, was subject to Part IV of the Act. I cannot accede to either argument.\nThis contract is not a policy of fire insurance. By sub-section 23 of section 1 of the Act:\u2014\n\u201cFire insurance\u201d means insurance (not being insurance incidental to some other class of insurance defined by or under this Act) against loss of or damage to property through fire, lightning or explosion due to ignition.\nLoss by fire was a risk insured against but the mere reading of the policy demonstrates that this was insurance incidental to some other class of insurance; and subsection 39 of section 1 shows that it was incidental to a class of insurance defined by the Act, i.e., marine insurance:\u2014\n\u201cMarine insurance\u201d means insurance against marine losses; that is to say, the losses incident to marine adventure, and may by the express terms of a contract or by usage of trade extend so as to protect the insured against losses on inland waters or by land or air which are incidental to any sea voyage. The contract was one of insurance against losses incident to marine adventure. By its express terms, it not only extends so as to protect the insured against losses on inland waters but is confined to protection against losses on an inland lake and tributary waters. It is clear from a consideration of the history of the relevant sections of The Insurance Act that subsection 39 of section 1 must be read so that the words \u201cwhich are incidental to any sea voyage\u201d do not apply to \u201closses on inland waters\u201d but only to the words \u201cagainst losses\u201d \u201cby land or air.\u201d By subsection 28 of section 1 of chapter 222 of The Insurance Act, R.S.O., 1927:\u2014\n\u201cInland marine insurance\u201d means marine insurance in respect of subjects of insurance at risk above the harbour of Montreal;\nand this subsection remained in the Act until 1934 when it was repealed and \u201cinland transportation insurance\u201d was defined by subsection 30 of section 1 as meaning,\u2014\ninsurance against loss of or damage to property while in transit by land, or by water and by land, or by air and by land or by water, or during delay wholly incidental to or accidentally arising out of the transit.\nIn the same year, \u201cmarine insurance\u201d was defined as we now find it in subsection 39 of section 1. The 1934 definition of \u201cinland transportation insurance\u201d was repealed in 1935 and re-enacted as it now appears in subsection 30 of section 1:\u2014\n\u201cInland transportation insurance\u201d means insurance (other than marine insurance) against loss of or damage to property,\u2014\n(a) while in transit or during delay incidental to transit; or\n(b) where, in the opinion of the Superintendent, the risk is substantially a transit risk.\nThe policy is not subject to Part IV of the present Act. By subsection 1 of section 102, that part applies \u201cto fire insurance and to any insurer carrying on the business of fire insurance in Ontario.\u201d For the reasons already given, the insurance against loss by fire was incidental to marine insurance and, therefore, not within the definition of \u201cfire insurance\u201d in subsection 23 of section 1. The statutory conditions do not apply and need not be considered.\nThe policy being one of marine insurance, the respondent relies upon the following statement in the margin of the policy:\u2014\nWARRANTED by the Insured that the within named yacht shall be used solely for private pleasure purposes and not to be hired or chartered unless approved and permission endorsed hereon. The trial judge, adopting the language of Lord Finlay in Dawsons, Limited v. Bonnin and others[4], was of the view that\nthe expression \u201cwarranty\u201d imports that a particular state of facts in the present or in the future is a term of the contract, and, further, that if the warranty is not made good the contract of insurance is void.\nDawsons\u2019 case[5] was considered in Provincial Insurance Company, Limited v. Morgan[6]. In the Court of Appeal, Lord Justice Scrutton, at pages 79-80, states:\u2014\nNo doubt a great deal turns upon the language of the particular policy; but it must be remembered that in contracts of insurance the word \u201cwarranty\u201d does not necessarily mean a condition or promise the breach of which will avoid the policy. A warranty that a marine policy is free from particular average certainly does not mean that if there is a partial loss to the insured ship the whole policy is avoided. It merely describes the risk, and means that the only risk being insured against is the risk of a total loss and that a partial loss is not the subject of the insurance. Again, if a time policy contains the clause \u201cwarranted no St. Lawrence between October 1 and April 1,\u201d and the vessel was in the St. Lawrence on October 2, but emerged without loss, and during the currency of the policy in July a loss happens, the underwriters cannot avoid payment on the ground that between October 1 and April 1 the vessel was in the St. Lawrence: Birrell v. Dryer[7]. That is an example of a so-called warranty which merely defines the risk insured against.\nIn that case the proposal for insurance signed by the applicant contained questions to be answered, one of which, as to the purposes for which the lorry proposed to be insured was to be used and the nature of the goods to be carried, was answered that the purpose was the delivery of coal and that the substance to be carried was coal; and the applicant thereby warranted and declared that the questions were fully and truthfully answered, and that the declaration and the answers should be the basis of the contract. The policy recited the proposal and stated that it was a condition precedent to any liability on the part of the insurer, (1) that the terms, conditions and endorsements thereof should be duly and faithfully observed; and (2) that the statements made and the answers given in the proposal form should be true, correct and complete. Under the heading \u201cEndorsements and Use Clauses\u201d in the policy were the words: \u201cTransportation of own goods in connection with the insured business.\u201d The premium paid by the assured was less than that which would have been payable if they had stated that the lorry was to be used for the purposes of general haulage. On a day during the period covered by the policy, the assured were using the lorry for carrying a load of timber under a contract, together with 5 cwt. of coal. After they had delivered all the timber and 3 cwt. of the coal and while they were on their way to deliver the remaining 2 cwt. of coal to a customer, a collision occurred.\nIn the House of Lords, the affirmance of the order of the Court of Appeal was put by Lord Buckmaster on this ground:\u2014\nTo state in full the purposes for which the vehicle is to be used is not the same thing as to state in full the purposes for which the vehicle will be exclusively used, and as a general description of the use of the vehicle it is not suggested that the answer was inaccurate.\nI am therefore of opinion that there was no bargain here so to confine the use of the vehicle to the cartage of coals as to make any occasional use that did not destroy the general purpose of its user a breach of the condition upon which the policy was based.\nLord Blanesburgh and Lord Warrington of Clyffe agreed; the latter also concurred with Lord Wright. Lord Wright treated the matter, as did Lord Buckmaster, as a question of the scope of the condition and held that it had not been broken.\nIn other words, both in the Court of Appeal and in the House of Lords, the promises of the assured were treated as merely descriptive of the risk and not that a certain state of things should continue, or a certain course of conduct be pursued during the whole period covered by the policy so that, if the particular promise be not kept, the policy was invalidated; that is,\nprovided the loss occurs while the state of things is in being the policy is not avoided by the fact that at some other time the state of things has been discontiued or interrupted[8].\nI refer particularly to the judgment of Lord Justice Scrutton because, as I read the speeches in the House of Lords, a majority, if not all, of the peers did not disagree with his views. Lord Buckmaster, with the con- currence of Lord Blanesburgh and Lord Warrington of Clyffe, thought the judgment of the Court of Appeal was right \u201cand the full explanation given by Scrutton L.J. renders further elaboration unnecessary.\u201d In any event, Lord Buckmaster also pointed out that in Dawsons\u2019 case[9], Lord Haldane had stated that the question which lies at the root of the matter is simply one of construction.\nIn the case at bar, I cannot read the statement in the margin of the policy as a condition that upon the yacht being used for other than private pleasure purposes the policy would be avoided even though at the time a loss was suffered the yacht was not being so used. One ground, therefore, upon which the trial judge concluded that the company was not liable,\u2014\u201cthat Cryderman\u2019s use of the boat on the occasions mentioned when he conveyed his workman and himself to the boom of logs,\u201d cannot be sustained.\nAs to the other ground, the trial judge thus expresses his views:\u2014\nThen the fourth and most serious objection is that Mr. Racicot used the boat on the very occasion when it burned, to convey his uncle to his mine for purposes of the uncle\u2019s. While I believe that he was not paid for it, and it was an entirely voluntary service that he was rendering his uncle, it can hardly be said in this instance that the boat was being used \u201cfor pleasure purposes.\u201d My finding of fact on that is that Racicot was using the boat without the knowledge of Staples, and therefore Staples had not knowledge of the purpose for which the boat was used; that Racicot was using it to convey his uncle to the mine, not for pleasure but to oblige his uncle in some business of the latter\u2019s; that he was not remunerated for the service; that he merely drove the boat to the mine; that the uncle got out of the boat to go about his business and while Racicot was backing up and turning around in the ordinary and usual manner, the boat caught fire and burned as has been described.\nIn the first place, there is nothing in the statement attached to the policy to prohibit the use of the yacht by someone other than the insured. The word \u201cprivate\u201d must be read in conjunction with the words \u201cand not to be hired or chartered unless approved and permission endorsed hereon.\u201d So read, the \u201cpleasure purposes\u201d may be private even when the yacht was used by Racicot with the appellant\u2019s implied permission. On the day of the fire, it was certainly not hired or chartered, and the question is whether Racicot, who \u201ctook his uncle up to another part of the lake, without remuneration, to a dam where the uncle was to inspect a mine for his own benefit,\u201d was using the yacht solely for private pleasure purposes. That question, in my view, must be answered in the affirmative. The yacht was not hired or chartered either by Racicot or by his uncle. The word \u201cpleasure\u201d has various meanings, depending upon the context in which it is used, and I think that on the occasion in question, it must be held that Racicot experienced \u201cenjoyment, delight, gratification\u201d (Oxford Dictionary), in transporting his uncle from one part of the lake to another, equally as well as if he had taken his uncle as a matter of friendship to a part of the lake in order to board a train or bus. The trial judge disposed of the other defences raised by the company and I can see no reason to disagree with his conclusions. The appeal should be allowed and judgment directed to be entered for the appellant as of the date of the trial judgment (November 2nd, 1939) for $1,500 and interest from June 25th, 1938, and costs. The appellant is entitled to his costs of the appeals to the Court of Appeal and to this Court.\nCROCKET J.\u2014I agree that this appeal should be allowed for the reasons stated by my brothers Davis and Kerwin.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: A.

Smart K.C. for the plaintiffs (appellants in one appeal and respondents in the other).\nH. N. Chauvin K.C. and F. B. Chauvin for the defendant (respondent in one appeal and appellant in the other).\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice\u2014The appeal of the plaintiff companies concerns a patent granted to one, Miller, on the 20th of June, 1933, and the defendant company's appeal concerns a patent granted to one, Wilson, on the 23rd of May, 1922. I have reached the conclusion that both appeals should be dismissed with costs.\nFirst, of Wilson's patent. Some years before the date of this patent it had come to be recognized that in the operation of vacuum tubes in signal receiving apparatus there are very important advantages in maintaining a negative bias upon the grid. There were different ways of doing this, those commonly used in such apparatus at that period being, (1) by connecting the grid with a separate source of negative potential, and (2) by inserting a resistance in the filament heating circuit and applying the drop of potential thus obtained to the grid. Wilson conceived the idea of imparting the negative bias to the grid by availing himself of the plate circuit. The advantages of this will be referred to later. There was a possible disadvantage against which provision had to be made; a disadvantage so great that if means were not found for surmounting it, it would be prohibitive. The disadvantage was this: If the rapid signal variations in the plate current were repeatedly impressed upon the grid, interference and loss of control would almost certainly result. It was essential to avoid this.\nWilson's invention consists in the idea of resorting to the plate circuit for the source of negative potential for the grid with the provision of means for meeting the practical objection that to allow the rapid variations in the plate current to be imposed upon the grid at this stage would be inadmissible. He solved this by providing separate paths for the two components of the plate current (the rapid signal variations component and the steady component) and connecting the grid with that part of the circuit not traversed by the rapidly fluctuating signal variations component. Wilson states in his specification that his invention provides a valuable improvement in vacuum tubes used in signal reception apparatus because it provides compensation against what he describes as \"the contact difference in potential between grid and cathode.\" Apparently, by reason of advances made toward perfecting the manufacture of vacuum tubes, this advantage of Wilson's invention has become obsolete. But it is said that by deriving the biasing potential from the steady component of the plate current, compensation is provided for slow changes in that current and this results in a uniformity of the operation of the tube which is not secured when the potential is derived from a special battery, or from the filament heating circuit. This is explained in the evidence of the plaintiffs' witness, Stevenson, at page 64 of the Appeal Case:\u2014\nQ. * * * What about variations in strength of the battery itself? A. If the strength of that current, the steady current, changes for any reason, it will produce a proportionate change in the bias potential and it will produce it in such a sense as to oppose the change itself.\nQ. With what result? A. With the result that the change is diminished.\nIn support of the contention that Wilson's invention had been anticipated, two patents are referred to, that of Mathes and that of Langmuir.\nMathes' arrangement bears some resemblance to that of Wilson's; his output circuit is so arranged as to separate the fluctuating signal component from the steady component of the plate current, but at the trial it was not disputed that approximately ninety-nine per cent of the negative potential supplied to the grid is obtained from the filament battery.\nAs to Langmuir, his invention had nothing to do with wireless receiving sets. Langmuir derives the negative potential for the grid from the plate circuit, but he was not concerned with the question with which Wilson had to deal, namely, the diversion of the fluctuating signal component of the plate current in such manner as to avoid impressing a second time the signal impulses upon the plate filament current.\nI think neither Langmuir's device, nor Mathes' device, constitutes anticipation of Wilson's invention.\nI have, I must say, been much concerned with the question whether Wilson's combination exhibits subject-matter. The means by which he provides separate paths for the two components of the plate current cannot, in themselves, be said to possess patentable novelty, as the learned President of the Exchequer Court points out, but the idea of providing separate paths for these components in order to obtain from the steady component of the plate filament current the negative potential requisite for biasing the grid was new and it seems, moreover, to have constituted a valuable improvement. I repeat, I have had a good deal of doubt on the point, but this much is certain, I am not sufficiently clear in my own mind that subject-matter is absent to justify the conclusion that the finding of the learned President in the opposite sense should be set aside.\nThere remains the question of infringement. The learned trial judge has found that Wilson's invention has been substantially taken. Once again, I can only say I think the point is a very arguable one, but I am not satisfied that the judgment of the learned President of the Exchequer Court can properly be reversed.\nAs to the Miller patent, I think the learned President arrived at the right conclusion; and I do not think it necessary to add anything to his reasons, with which I agree.\nAppeal by plaintiff and appeal by defendant both dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs (appellants in one appeal and respondents in the other): Smart & Biggar.\nSolicitors for the defendant (respondent in one appeal and appellant in the other): Chauvin, Walker, Stewart & Martineau.\n[1] [1940] Ex.

In repayment thereof he handed the said secretary six post-dated cheques of the Freehold Company aggregating the above sum and dated respectively the 8th, 9th, 10th, 12th, 13th and 14th of April, 1937. Three days later the Freehold Company's balance sheet was made up by the company's chartered accountants, showing current assets as of March 31st, 1937, to include \" cash in bank $48,789.76.\" This amount included the sum of $40,336.46 obtained by the respondent as aforesaid. Four days later at a meeting of the directors the balance sheet was approved. The annual meeting of the company was called for April 14th and a copy of the balance sheet was directed to be forwarded to the shareholders with the notice calling the meeting. No disclosure was made to the shareholders of the six post-dated cheques. Particulars delivered pursuant to order stated that the false statement consisted in entries in the books of the company showing a sale of shares of another company for $40,336.46 and a re-purchase of the same number of shares from a third company for the same amount, and an audited balance sheet showing as an asset \"Cash in bank\" $48,789.76, which did not reflect the true financial position of the respondent's company. The respondent was convicted under section 414 of the Criminal Code, for that he, being a director of a public company, did, with intent to deceive its shareholders, concur in making a statement of its financial position which he knew to be false in a material particular, viz., that the assets of the company consisted of $48,789.76 in cash. The trial judge, Lennox Co.J., found that although on the material date the company had cash in the bank in said amount, yet the statement was false in that it did not show that of that amount $46,336.46 represented money borrowed by the company which was still owing to the lender. The Court of Appeal reversed that judgment, quashed the conviction and held (Macdonald C.J.B.C. and O'Halloran J.A. dissenting) that while the respondent might have been charged with falsifying the balance sheet at large in not showing the true state of the company's affairs or that it was false in particular in not disclosing the liability for the loan, nevertheless the respondent ought not to have been convicted of making a false balance sheet as alleged in the terms of the conviction, because in truth the company had in the bank to its credit the sum of $48,789.76 and that sum was an asset of the company no matter what liabilities there were against it: the Crown elected to complain of only one item and that item by itself was unquestionably a true and not a false \" material particular.\"\nE.

Plaintiffs had arranged with the Marine Co. (which was agent for a number of individual ships, each owned by a separate company) for carriage of the goods to Montreal by a certain steamer, then inbound, and were directed by the Marine Co. to send the goods to said pier, where said steamer would on its arrival load Vancouver cargo. A wharfage charge in respect to said goods was payable to the Steamship Co. The pier was in process of being enlarged, but at the time of the fire, which was on a Sunday afternoon, no construction work was going on; nor were there at the pier any ships or movement of freight or transaction of any passenger or other business; and on the day before, a weekly clean-up of the pier had been made; there were two watchmen on duty, stationed at the shore end of the pier, to prevent visiting by the public. The fire started at the other end of the pier from an unknown cause.\nThe trial judge, Manson J., dismissed the action, holding that plaintiffs' loss did not arise out of any act or omission of either of the defendants (53 B.C.R. 207). His decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal for British Columbia ([1940] 2 W.W.R. 97; [1940] 4 D.L.R. 171). Plaintiffs appealed to this Court.\nHeld: Plaintiffs' appeal should be dismissed.\nThe trial judge's findings against negligence by defendants, as to origin of the fire, or its spreading so as to destroy plaintiffs' goods, were, on the evidence, agreed with or accepted in the reasons for judg- ment in this Court. (The question of onus of proof with respect to negligence was discussed to some extent, but, on the evidence and findings, decision thereon was unnecessary).\nPer Crocket and Davis JJ.: Outbreak of fire in a structure where fire is not employed in its operation or use is a remote, not a probable, risk, and the trial judge found upon the evidence that the risk of fire was in fact remote. In view of the varying risks of fire in different classes of buildings, no rule can be laid down. \"The degree of want of care which constitutes negligence must vary with the circumstances. What that degree is, is a question for the jury or the Court in lieu of a jury. ***\" (Caswell v. Powell, [1940] A.C. 152, at 176). Whether there was negligence by the Steamship Co. in failing to stop the fire before it spread to plaintiffs' goods was a question of fact, and on the evidence the destruction of the goods was not caused by its negligence; and the same must apply to the carrier, the Marine Co., which at the time of the destruction had not taken delivery of the goods from the pier.\nPer Kerwin J.: The Marine Co. could not be liable on any basis; even if it be treated as the owner of said steamer, the highest at which its arrangement with plaintiffs might be put was that the goods should be carried on the steamer to Montreal; and the goods were destroyed without ever having come into the Marine Co.'s possession in any capacity. The Steamship Co. was not the carrier but received and held the goods merely as warehouseman. (Discussion of onus of proof as to negligence in the fire's origin). On the evidence, the Steamship Co. fulfilled its full duty to exercise the same degree of care towards the preservation of plaintiffs' goods as \"might reasonably be expected from a skilled storekeeper, acquainted with the risks to be apprehended either from the character of the storehouse itself or of its locality\" (Brabant v. King, [1895] A.C. 632, at 640). As to precautions against spread of fire\u2014The pier was in process of construction; it was impossible to do everything at once; and though certain standards may be set before prospective builders by insurance men as something desirable to be attained, a warehouseman cannot be held liable merely because he did not choose to spend as much money as the adoption of those standards would involve.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiffs from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] in so far as that judgment dismissed their appeal from the judgment of Manson J. at trial[2].\nThe action was brought to recover damages from the defendants in the sum of $13,406.10, as being the value of the plaintiffs' goods lost by a fire which destroyed the pier of the defendant Canadian National Steamship Co. Ltd. at Vancouver on August 10, 1930. At the time of the fire the goods were on the pier awaiting shipment on a certain vessel (owned by a separate company) of which the defendant Canadian Government Merchant Marine Ltd. was agent. The material facts and circumstances of the case (on findings made or accepted in this Court) are sufficiently stated in the reasons for judgment in this Court now reported.\nThe trial judge, Manson J., dismissed the action, holding that the loss sustained by the plaintiffs did not arise out of any act or omission of either of the defendants. His judgment in that respect was affirmed by the Court of Appeal (per Martin C.J.B.C. and Sloan J.A. O'Halloran J.A., dissenting in part, would have allowed the plaintiffs' appeal as against Canadian National Steamship Co. Ltd.).\nManson J., subsequent to delivering his reasons for judgment dismissing the action, gave a decision as to the tariff of costs applicable (a substituted tariff having come into force since his reasons for dismissing the action were delivered) and as to the scale of costs and as to the date which the judgment should bear. In respect of these matters the plaintiffs' appeal to the Court of Appeal was allowed; and this was the subject of a cross-appeal by the defendants to this Court.\nThe appeal and the cross-appeal to this Court were dismissed with costs.\nR. L. Maitland K.C. and A. C. DesBrisay for the appellants.\nA. Alexander for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2014I concur in dismissing the appeal. The judgment of Crocket and Davis JJ. was delivered by\nDAVIS J.\u2014The appellants' goods, being 1,588 cases of canned salmon, were destroyed by fire while on the pier of the respondent, Canadian National Steamship Company Limited (hereinafter referred to as \"the Steamship company\"), at Vancouver awaiting shipment by water by the respondent Canadian Government Merchant Marine, Limited (hereinafter referred to as \"the Marine company\"). This action was brought against both companies for damages for the loss sustained; against the Steamship company, as a warehouseman, and against the Marine company, as a carrier, upon the basis that the carriage must be considered as having been commenced when the goods were left on the pier designated by the carrier as the place from which the goods would be picked up for carriage.\nThe pier was a large terminal pier in the port of Vancouver owned and operated by the Steamship company which engages in a freight and passenger trade on the Pacific coast. The Marine company did not own or operate any pier or dock terminals at Vancouver but had an office in the Canadian National Railway depot in Vancouver and carried on business as agent for a number of individual ships, each owned by a separate incorporated company. The pier in question was 1,000 feet long and 220 feet wide. The sub-structure consisted of creosoted piles driven in coarse sand and gravel fill. The piles were capped and upon the stringers laid thereon was a deck. Upon the deck was located a warehouse\u2014a two-storey structure at the south end, the upper storey of which was divided into a passenger concourse and offices. Around the whole warehouse on the second storey there ran a promenade gallery for the use of friends of ships' passengers. Outside the warehouse the deck, which was referred to as an apron, was made of four-inch planks with a 3\/8-inch space between them laid on the stringers. The apron was 12 feet wide.\nThe appellants in July, 1930, having agreed to sell 1,588 cases of canned salmon to a purchaser in Montreal, made arrangements for their shipment from Vancouver to Montreal via the Panama canal. The manager telephoned to the offices of the Marine company in Vancouver and \"booked\" space for their carriage on a then inbound steamer, the Canadian Miller. The manager was informed that the Miller would on her arrival load Vancouver cargo at the Steamship company's pier, and he was directed to send the goods there, which was done. The arrangement, if any, existing at the time of the fire between the Marine company and the Steamship company, and the terms, if any, upon which the Canadian Miller would have used the facilities upon arrival in Vancouver, and any arrangement there may have been between the two companies, were not the subject of any evidence at the trial.\nAs to part of the shipment, 388 cases, the appellants were given a receipt at the pier which purported to be from the pier owners, acknowledging receipt of the goods but stating that they would not be liable for loss unless loss was due to negligence on their part. The other portion of the shipment, 1,200 cases, was received at the pier but it came in by water and the master of the boat when he left these goods on the pier received a manifest which was a mere acknowledgment of receipt of the goods, and there was no limitation of liability on the document. In the view I take of the appeal, the question of onus does not, however, become of any consequence.\nThe distinction must be drawn, it seems to me, and it is a distinction vital to a case of this sort, between negligence in the origin of a fire and negligence in suffering a fire to spread. I did not understand it to be seriously contended by counsel for the appellants that the origin of the fire in question could be attributed to any negligence on the part of the respondents, or either of them, and in any case there are, I think, concurrent findings that there was no such negligence. That being so, the case is taken out of the line of authorities in which on the facts there was negligence which caused the fire, such, for instance, as a boiler in a factory being carelessly looked after, resulting in the commencement of a fire. On the basis that the fire did not originate through any negligence on the part of the respondents, the case must then be approached from the point of view whether or not there was negligence in suffering the fire to spread from the place of its origin to the place in the shed on the pier where the particular goods were stored at the time, and if so, then was that the direct cause of the loss of the goods?\nThe action was not brought to trial until nearly eight years after the date of the fire. The fire was on August 10th, 1930, and the case did not come to trial until June, 1938. That may well account for much lack of exactness in the evidence as to the place and circumstances of the origin of the fire, the location of the goods in the shed on the pier and the efforts actually made to prevent the spread of the fire. No satisfactory explanation was offered for the long delay in taking the case to trial.\nThe fire occurred on a Sunday afternoon, when the whole structure was destroyed. No ships lay at the pier, no freight was being moved, no passenger or other business was being transacted, and although operations then in progress for the enlargement of the pier were being carried on during the week-days, there were no workmen doing any work or present on the pier that day. There were two watchmen on duty at the pier for each eight-hour shift\u2014one employed by the Steamship company and one by the contractors\u2014but they were stationed at the time at the shore end of the long pier to prevent the public from visiting it. The only foreseeable risk that day was theft or fire that might be caused by trespassers coming on the pier. Consequently the watchmen were on duty at the shore end of the pier to keep people out. The fire broke out as a small flame at the extreme northwest corner of the pier (that is, the end of the pier far out in the water)\u2014the evidence is not precise whether it originated below the deck (or apron) of the pier or upon it\u2014at any rate the fire originated at a point which at least gives weight to the respondents' contention that it probably originated from sparks from some passing steamer becoming lodged in the wooden part of the structure at the extreme end of the pier. Whether the fire started under the deck or on top of it, it is clear that the fire was burning underneath the deck during its early stages. No one appears to have noticed the flame for some minutes until it had then become a substantial fire ready to spread itself over the pier and the storage shed upon the pier. There were some twenty or more hand chemical fire-extinguishers on the pier; one was placed in the dock office and three or four were placed along each side of the shed, about 100 yards apart. Some of the fire-extinguishers were loose and when men were working on week-days they would take them around with them so that in case of fire they had fire-extinguishers close to them. Measures were taken to keep the pier free of dirt and debris. A weekly clean-up had been carried out the day before the fire and the structure was clean from end to end on the day of the fire. In addition to the regular fire service provided by the Vancouver Fire Department, the respondent Steamship company had engaged the services of the British Columbia District Telegraph and Messenger Company which provided a special watchman and fire service. Five fire-alarm signal boxes were installed on the pier. The structure itself had fire-resisting features; a lower fire insurance rate had been fixed for this pier than for any of the other piers of the same class in Vancouver. The evidence goes to indi- cate that the fire at its inception could not adequately have been fought from the shore end and that the only way it could have been promptly handled was by means of fire-boats, which were lacking in Vancouver harbour.\nOutbreak of fire in a structure where fire is not employed in its operation or use is a remote, not a probable, risk and the learned trial judge found upon the evidence that the risk of fire was in fact remote. It is not possible, of course, in view of the varying risks of fire in different classes of buildings, to lay down any rule. The learned trial judge expressly found that the watchman service was adequate. While twenty minutes may have elapsed between the commencement of the fire and the turning in of the fire alarm, the fire was for at least half of that time a very insignificant flame partly, if not wholly, under the apron of the northwest corner of the pier\u2014a most unlikely place to suspect the outbreak of a fire and a most difficult place to detect in its early stages. As to water being available to extinguish the fire, the finding of the trial judge was that there were available four stand-pipes 200 feet apart, serviced by a six-inch water main carrying about 115 pounds pressure on fifty feet of hose attached to each outlet. There was complaint of what was said to be unnecessary delay in connecting up the sprinkler system, but the learned trial judge found that the installation of such a system was not necessary to satisfy the standard of care required of a bailee. In any event, the evidence does not establish unnecessary delay in this regard and it was not one of the several heads of negligence set forth in the statement of claim. As Lord Wright said in Caswell v. Powell[3]:\nThe degree of want of care which constitutes negligence must vary with the circumstances. What that degree is, is a question for the jury or the Court in lieu of a jury. It is not a matter of uniform standard. It may vary according to the circumstances from man to man, from place to place, from time to time.\nIt is a question of fact whether there was negligence on the part of the Steamship company in failing to stop the fire before it spread to the goods in question. I am satisfied on the evidence that the destruction of the goods was not caused by negligence on the part of the Steamship company. And the same, of course, must apply to the carrier, the Marine company, which at the time of the destruction of the goods had not taken delivery of them from the pier.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nThe cross-appeal as to costs should also, in my opinion, be dismissed for the reasons given in the Court below.\nKERWIN J.\u2014This is an action in the name of M. DesBrisay and H. A. Bulwer (carrying on business under the name of M. DesBrisay and Company) and the said M. DesBrisay and Company against Canadian National Steamship Company Limited, hereafter referred to as the Steamship company, and Canadian Government Merchant Marine Limited. The action arises out of the delivery to the Steamship company's dock, in Vancouver, of 1,588 cases of canned salmon and their loss when the dock was destroyed by fire on August 10th, 1930. The salmon was owned by M. DesBrisay and Company, who had insured themselves against loss by fire, and these proceedings are really brought by the Insurance company which paid the loss and was subrogated to the rights of the owner.\nSometime during the month of July, 1930, the plaintiff arranged, by telephone, with Canadian Government Merchant Marine Limited for the carriage of the salmon to Montreal by the S.S. Canadian Miller, and the plaintiff was directed to send the goods to the Steamship company's dock. Of the total number of cases of salmon, 1,200 came from Ewen's Cannery, Fraser River, British Columbia, by the S.S. Westham addressed to the order of B.C. Packers Limited, Vancouver, and were delivered to the dock on July 30th, 1930. C. B. Smith, the Steamship company's dock agent, merely acknowledged receipt of them by signing his name and the date at the foot of the Westham's manifest. On July 31st, B.C. Packers Limited signed a delivery order in favour of the Bank of Montreal, who, on August 8th, sent it to the Steamship company and directed the latter to release the goods to the plaintiff. The order and direction were received by the Steamship company on August 9th. In the meantime the plaintiff had employed an outside company to label the cases on the dock and this work was completed on August 7th. The remainder of the salmon, consisting of two lots of 338 and 50 cases respectively, were sent by the plaintiff from the Ballantyne Pier in Vancouver on August 8th and received at the Steamship company's dock on the same day. Their receipt was acknowledged on forms prepared for use by Vancouver Harbour Commissioners but there can be no dispute that they expressed the terms upon which the two lots were received and held by the Steamship company for the plaintiff. So read, they provide that the Steamship company received the goods as warehousemen and \"are not to be liable for any loss or damage from whatever cause arising unless proved to have resulted from negligence of the [Company] or of their servants.\" In a note at the bottom, it is stated: \"Shipper should exchange this Original Receipt for Steamship Lines usual Bill of Lading before sailing of the Steamer.\"\nAt the trial, the plaintiff put in as evidence parts of the examination for discovery of Mr. Keeley, the Manager of the Steamship company and General Manager of Canadian Government Merchant Marine Limited, which part included a statement by counsel for the defendants. This statement was taken as Mr. Keeley's answer to a question put to him. From this statement it appears that the S.S. Canadian Miller was owned by an incorporated company bearing the same name; that Canadian Government Merchant Marine Limited acted as agent for it and some other coastwise steamers; and that such ships used, in Vancouver, the dock owned by the defendant Steamship company. I have no hesitation in agreeing with all the judges below that Canadian Government Merchant Marine Limited is not liable in this action on any basis. Even if it be treated as the owner of the S.S. Canadian Miller, the highest at which the arrangement made between the plaintiff and it may be put, is that the salmon should be carried on the Canadian Miller to Montreal. The salmon was destroyed without ever having come into the possession of that defendant in any capacity.\nSo far as the defendant Steamship company is concerned, the 388 cases came into its possession by the clear terms of the receipt forms used, as warehousemen. The trial judge was of opinion that the 1,200 cases must be taken to have come into the Steamship company's possession upon the same terms as are expressed in these forms. I cannot agree that this is so, since the 1,200 cases were received some days before the other two lots; they were received from B.C. Packers Limited ex S.S. Westham and any alleged practice between the plaintiff and the defendants, or either of them, could not, as against the latter, apply to a consignment received from a third person and, so far as the evidence discloses, never owned by the plaintiff until the Bank of Montreal, on August 8th, directed the Steamship company to release the goods to the plaintiff or, at any rate, until the plaintiff authorized the labelling of the cases. However, on the first issue raised by the Steamship company, the result is the same, i.e., the Steamship company was not the carrier but received and held all the salmon merely as warehousemen.\nThere remains the question whether the Steamship company fulfilled its duty to the plaintiff as warehouseman of the salmon,\u2014with respect to all of which a wharfage charge was payable. As to the 388 cases, the onus was plainly, by the terms of the receipts, upon the plaintiff to prove negligence. As to the 1,200 cases, the proceedings might have been differently framed but as a matter of fact, the action was treated as one for damages for the loss, by negligence, of the three lots of salmon. It was common knowledge, I think, that the salmon had been destroyed in the fire, and this is not a case where the return of the warehoused goods had been demanded by the plaintiff. The sole issue was negligence or no negligence. It is true that at the opening of the trial, counsel for the plaintiff stated:\u2014\nThe goods were not returned to the plaintiff, and were not delivered to anyone else to their order, and the value of them was not paid. Our contention is that the onus in that respect is entirely upon the defendants. The goods have never been delivered, and their price has never been paid.\nHe immediately continued, however:\u2014\nWe say that they were negligent in their duty in not properly caring for the goods when they were in their possession.\nand examinations for discovery were put in on behalf of the plaintiff with a view of showing that the dock was not erected in accordance with certain recommendations that had been made, that a sprinkler system had been installed but had not been connected with the water supply at the time of the fire, and that waste from the spinning of oakum had been allowed to remain on the apron of the dock.\nAssuming, however, that the ordinary responsibility of a warehouseman rested upon the Steamship company to explain its inability to return the 1,200 cases, the evidence discloses that explanation,\u2014loss by fire. So much being shown, it is at least arguable that the onus was then on the plaintiff to prove that the fire was a negligent one and did not \"accidentally begin\" within the meaning of 14 Geo. III, c. 78, s. 86. Port Coquitlam v. Wilson[4]; McAuliffe v. Hubbell[5]; Beven on Negligence, 4th edition, page 624, where, referring to Filliter v. Phippard[6], it is stated:\nThe effect of this decision is to require the plaintiff affirmatively to show negligence before he can recover; unless, indeed, the facts are such as raise the inference of negligence.\nFacts sufficient to raise the inference of negligence were present in United Motors Service Inc. v. Hutson[7] but not here.\nIn reality it is not necessary in the present case to rely upon any onus cast upon the plaintiff, because I agree, as did the majority of the Court of Appeal, with this statement of the trial judge:\u2014\nNo evidence was led to even remotely suggest that the fire had its origin through any act or omission of the defendants, their servants or agents,\nand with this definite finding made by him, which follows the statement just quoted:\u2014\nIn my view it was satisfactorily shown that the fire was due to some extraneous circumstance over which the defendants, their servants or agents had no control.\nI entirely agree with the trial judge and the majority of the Court of Appeal that there was nothing done or omitted by the Steamship company in connection with the building of the dock or the use of it which caused or contributed to the starting of the fire. The Steamship company fulfilled its full duty to exercise the same degree of care towards the preservation of the plaintiff's goods as \"might reasonably be expected from a skilled storekeeper, acquainted with the risks to be apprehended either from the character of the storehouse itself or of its locality.\" (Brabant v. King[8]). The remainder of Lord Watson's sentence from which the above is taken has no relevancy to the present appeal.\nIt was next contended that the circumstances are such as impose liability upon the Steamship company for the spread of the fire. In this connection it must be remembered that the dock was in the process of being constructed. It was impossible to do everything at once and while it appears from the evidence that certain standards are set before prospective builders, by insurance men, as something desirable to be attained, a warehouseman cannot be held liable merely because he did not choose to spend as much money as the adoption of those standards would involve. As to the circumstance that the sprinkler system had been installed but not connected with the water supply, no fault can, I think, be found with the Steamship company because of the time that had elapsed. In fact, on these questions and also with respect to the other matters of complaint, I agree so thoroughly with the view of the learned trial judge that I am content to adopt his conclusions. I might add but one word as to Foot, who was a watchman for the company that had the contract to construct the dock and who was not called as a witness. It does not appear whether he was alive but, in view of all the evidence and of the fact that the trial was held eight years after the fire, one would not be surprised if he were not available or if he had nothing to add to the testimony of the Steamship company's watchman. As to the objection that various other superior officials of the Steamship company were not called, it is sufficient to point out that some of them were examined for discovery at length and there is nothing to indicate that they could have added to the knowledge obtained by the Court from the evidence before it.\nA question as to the scale and quantum of costs payable to the defendants was raised before the Court of Appeal, all the members of which agreed in that respect with the plaintiff's contention and directed a variation of the judgment. The defendants gave notice of cross-appeal to this Court upon that question. Such a matter is more properly disposed of by the Judges in the Court of Appeal and I would not interfere with the conclusion at which they arrived.\nThe appeal and cross-appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nHUDSON J.\u2014I agree that this appeal and the cross-appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe learned trial judge found as a fact that the loss of the plaintiff's goods was not due to any negligence on the part of the defendants. This view was confirmed by the Court of Appeal and a review of the evidence does not lead me to any different conclusion. On the questions of law involved, I have nothing to add to what has been said by my brothers Davis and Kerwin.\nAppeal and cross-appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Bourne & DesBrisay.\nSolicitor for the respondents: A.

The Commissioner of Patents decided that, upon the material before him, K. was the prior inventor. Appellant then, as provided for in s. 44 (8) of The Patent Act, 1935 (Dom., c. 32), commenced proceedings in the Exchequer Court for the determination of the respective rights of the parties. Appellant in its statement of claim alleged that its assignors were in fact the first inventors and that appellant was entitled as against respondent to the issue of patent, and asked that it be so adjudged; and alternatively, by par. 8, in the event that the Court should find that K. was the first inventor, it alleged that K. had been employed in appellant's experimental department and if K. made any invention he made it in the course of such employment and when he was carrying out work which he was instructed to do on appellant's behalf; that by virtue of the contract of employment and the circumstances under which the invention was made, K. became and was a trustee of the invention for appellant which was entitled to the benefit of it; that K. was by reason of his being such a trustee unable to transfer any right, title or interest in the invention to any other party and appellant was now the owner of it; and asked that it be so adjudged and that respondent be ordered to execute an assignment to appellant of the entire right, title and interest in and to the invention and the application relating to it.\nOn motion by respondent in the Exchequer Court, said par. 8 and the prayers based thereon were struck out, it being held that appellant was not entitled to raise the issue pleaded by par. 8 in proceedings originating under s. 44 of said Act.\nAppellant appealed to this Court. Respondent objected that this Court had no jurisdiction to hear the appeal. Argument was heard both on that point and on the merits of the appeal.\nHeld: This Court had jurisdiction to hear the appeal. That point stands to be decided, not under the provisions of the Supreme Court Act, but under the provisions of the Exchequer Court Act and of the Patent Act (British American Brewing Co. Ltd. v. The King, [1935] S.C.R. 568, at 570). The requirements of s. 82 of the Exchequer Court Act (R.S.C., 1927, c. 34) existed. The judgment appealed from was a \"judgment upon a demurrer or point of law raised by the pleadings\" and, that being so, the conditions of jurisdiction are complied with if the right immediately involved in the action or cause in which the demurrer or point of law was raised exceeds in value $500\u2014it is not required that there should be at stake a pecuniary sum exceeding $500. (Massie & Renwick Ltd. v. Underwriters' Survey Bureau Ltd., [1937] S.C.R. 265, at 266; Sun Life Assce. Co. of Canada v. Superintendent of Insurance, [1930] 8.C.R. 612; Burt Business Forms Ltd. v. Johnson, [1933] S.C.R. 128, cited).\nHeld, also: The appeal should be allowed and the parts of appellant's statement of claim in question restored. Although the occasion for appellant's action was the Commissioner's decision that the applications were in conflict and that he would allow the claims to respondent, yet under the express enactment in s. 44 (8) (iv) of the Patent Act, 1935, the Exchequer Court could decide \"that one of the applicants was entitled as against the other to the issue of a patent including the claims in conflict as applied for by him\"; and, for the determination of that point, there is nothing in the Act or in the law which could prevent appellant from urging any fact or contention necessary or useful for the purpose of enabling the Court to decide between the parties. The allegations in said par. 8, if true, and the conclusions based thereon, if legally correct, would be a reason for a declaration in appellant's favour in the terms of s. 44 (8) (iv), and the point so raised would properly lead to the remedies prayed for by appellant; and these remedies would be within the jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court as being covered by said s. 44 (8) (iv). It is true that the Exchequer Court has no jurisdiction to determine an issue purely and simply concerning a contract between subject and subject (The King and Hume and Consolidated Distilleries Ltd. and Consolidated Exporters Corpn. Ltd., [1930] S.C.R. 531); but here the subject-matter of appellant's allegation only incidentally refers to the contract of employment; the allegation primarily concerns the invention, of which appellant claims to be the owner as a result of the contract and other alleged facts. A further reason why the Exchequer Court should exercise jurisdiction upon the point is the enactment in s. 22 (c) (as enacted in 1928, c. 23, s. 3) of the Exchequer Court Act, which gives that court jurisdiction between subject and subject in all cases where a \"remedy is sought under the authority of any Act of the Parliament of Canada or at Common Law or in Equity, respecting any patent of invention * * *.\" The remedy sought by appellant, as a result of said par. 8, is a remedy in equity respecting a patent of invention.\n(The Court pointed out that its judgment was limited to the interpretation of the statutory enactments, no question having been raised as to their constitutionality).\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the order of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], striking out a certain paragraph of the plaintiff's statement of claim and certain sub-paragraphs of the claims in said statement of claim. The parts in question of the statement of claim, the nature of the action or proceedings, and the questions for determination, including an objection against this Court's jurisdiction to hear the appeal, are sufficiently stated in the reasons for judgment now reported. The appeal was allowed and the parts in question of the statement of claim restored.\nO. M. Biggar K.C. and M. B. Gordon for the appellant.\nS. M. Clark K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014Two applications for a patent of an invention relating to Prepared Food and Process of Gun-Puffing the same were pending in the Patent Office. One of them was made by the appellant's assignors, McKay & Penty; and the other by the administratrix of the estate of John L. Kellogg, Jr., under whom by various mesne assignments the respondent claims.\nThe Commissioner of Patents decided that, upon the material before him, the respondent's husband was, as between the parties, the first to make the invention. He notified the appellant accordingly; and, thereupon, the appellant commenced proceedings in the Exchequer Court of Canada for the determination of the respective rights of the parties.\nUnder such circumstances, the Commissioner must suspend further action on the applications in conflict until in such action it has been determined either\n(i) that there is in fact no conflict between the claims in question, or\n(ii) that none of the applicants is entitled to the issue of a patent containing the claims in conflict as applied for by him, or\n(iii) that a patent or patents, including substitute claims approved by the Court, may issue to one or more of the applicants, or\n(iv) that one of the applicants is entitled as against the others to the issue of a patent including the claims in conflict as applied for by him. (Subs. 8 of s. 44 of the Patent Act, 1935).\nThe statement of claim of the appellant asserted that the latter was the owner by assignment of the invention in question; that it had been advised by the Commissioner of Patents that its application was in conflict with another application assigned to the respondent by New Foods Incorporated, to which the rights to the alleged invention had been assigned by John L. Kellogg, Sr., who was himself the assignee of the original applicant, the administratrix of the estate of John L. Kellogg, Jr.\nThe appellant further alleged that McKay & Penty, and not the said John L. Kellogg, Jr., were in fact the inventors of the subject-matter covered by both of the aforesaid applications and that, therefore, the appellant was entitled, as against the respondent, to the issue of the patent.\nAnd, as an alternative claim, the appellant further stated: 8. In the event that the Court should find as a fact that the said John L. Kellogg, Jr., was the first inventor of the subject-matter of the said application serial No. 450,047, then the plaintiff alleges\n(a) That the late John L. Kellogg, Jr., was employed in the Experimental Department of the Kellogg Company from October 15, 1936, until December 19, 1936;\n(b) If any invention was made by the said John L. Kellogg, Jr., which is not admitted but denied, it was made during and in the course of his employment by the plaintiff and when he was carrying out work which he was instructed to do on the plaintiff's behalf. By virtue of the contract of employment and the circumstances under which the invention was made the said John L. Kellogg, Jr., became and was a trustee of the invention for the company which was and is entitled to the benefit of it.\n(c) The said John L. Kellogg, Jr., was by reason of his being such a trustee unable to transfer any right, title or interest in the invention to any other party and the plaintiff is now the owner of any invention covered by the application serial No. 450,047.\nThe conclusions of the appellant's action were for an order that Messrs. McKay & Penty were, in fact, the first inventors of the subject-matter of the applications and that, as between the parties, the appellant was entitled to the issue of the patent, including the claims in conflict, which are all the claims of both the applications; but, following the allegation that, if John L. Kellogg, Jr., was the first inventor, his invention was made during and in the course of his employment by the appellant and that he had, thereby, become and was a trustee of the invention for the company, the appellant alternatively prayed that it should be adjudged that the appellant was the owner of the invention made by the late John L. Kellogg, Jr., and that the respondent should be directed to execute an assignment to the appellant of the entire right, title and interest in and to the invention and the application relating to it.\nThe respondent moved for an order striking out paragraph eight above reproduced of the appellant's statement of claim (and consequently that part of the conclusions based upon it) on the ground that the Exchequer Court of Canada had no jurisdiction to hear and determine the allegations and issues therein contained, and that the said paragraph was impertinent or irrelevant and might tend to prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair trial of the action.\nThe judgment appealed from allowed the motion upon the ground that the jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court, if any, was to be found within s. 44 of the Patent Act, as otherwise the appellant's claim, in paragraph 8, was one which dealt with property and civil rights and which fell within the jurisdiction of the provincial courts.\nIn the view of the learned President, who delivered the judgment, what the Court was required to determine under s. 44 related to the claims in conflict, and nothing else. The appellant was not entitled, therefore, to raise the issue pleaded by paragraph 8 in proceedings originating under s. 44 of the Act. Furthermore, the material pleaded in that paragraph appeared to be one of contract between subject and subject; and it was to be doubted if the Court had jurisdiction to determine such an issue which would appear to be an issue to be determined by the provincial courts.\nThe appellant then appealed to this Court and was met by the objection that this Court had no jurisdiction to hear the appeal.\nThat preliminary question stands to be decided, not under the provisions of the Supreme Court Act, but under the provisions of the Exchequer Court Act and of the Patent Act (British American Brewing Company Limited v. His Majesty the King[2]).\nThe Exchequer Court Act (s. 82) gives the right of appeal to this Court to\nany party to any action, suit, cause, matter or other judicial proceeding, in which the actual amount in controversy exceeds five hundred dollars, who is dissatisfied with any final judgment, or with any judgment upon any demurrer or point of law raised by the pleadings.\nThe judgment appealed from is clearly a \"judgment upon a demurrer or point of law raised by the pleadings.\" Moreover, the judgment a quo, being in the nature of a judgment on demurrer, it would seem that \"notwithstanding the unfortunate wording of section 82 of the Exchequer Court Act,\" it is not necessary that the \"actual amount in controversy\" in the appeal should exceed the sum of five hundred dollars (Massie & Renwick, Limited v. Underwriters' Survey Bureau Limited[3]), provided the action, suit or cause in which the demurrer or point of law was raised is itself for an amount or value exceeding five hundred dollars. The conditions of jurisdiction are complied with if the right immediately involved in the action or cause amounts to the value of five hundred dollars; and it is not required that there should be at stake a pecuniary sum of more than five hundred dollars (The Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada v. The Superintendent of Insurance[4]; Burt Business Forms Limited v. Johnson[5]). We are of opinion that the requirements of s. 82 of the Exchequer Court Act existed in this case and that we should, therefore, proceed to render judgment on the merits of the appeal.\nAlthough the occasion for the appellant's action was the decision of the Commissioner that the respective applications of the appellant and of the respondent were in conflict and that he would allow the claims to the respondent, the appellant, in bringing suit against the respondent, was not limited to an action for the purpose of having it determined either that there was no conflict between the claims in question, or that none of the applicants was entitled to the issue of a patent containing the claims in conflict, or that a patent or patents (including substitute claims approved by the Court) may issue to one or more of the applicants; but the Exchequer Court could also decide that one of the applicants was entitled, as against the other, to the issue of a patent including the claims in conflict, as applied for by him. We have already seen that such was the express enactment of subs. 8 of s. 44 of the Patent Act, 1935.\nAnd, for the determination of the latter point, we see nothing in the Act or in the law which could prevent the appellant from urging any fact or contention necessary or useful for the purpose of enabling the Court to decide between the parties.\nIt may be contended that an applicant, bringing an action before the Court as a result of a decision made by the Commissioner that there exists a conflict and that he will allow the claims to the conflicting applicant, is not necessarily limited to one or more of the four remedies provided for by subs. 8 of s. 44, and that he may, in addition, put forward facts and contentions of a nature to justify a different or an additional remedy. It is sufficient, for the purposes of the present case, to say that the allegations contained in paragraph 8 of the appellant's statement of claim, and the conclusions based thereon, come within the wording of paragraph (iv) of subs. (8), for if it be true\u2014as must be assumed for the purposes of deciding the point of jurisdiction\u2014that the appellant is entitled to the benefit of the invention because John L. Kellogg, Jr., at the time when he is alleged to have made it, was in the employ of the appellant and then carrying out work which he was instructed to do on the plaintiff's behalf, and that, by virtue of his contract of employment and the circumstances under which the invention was made, he became and is a trustee of the invention for the company; if it be true further that, by reason of his being such a trustee, he was unable to transfer any right, title, or interest in the invention to any other party, and that the plaintiff is now the owner of any invention so made by John L. Kellogg, Jr., this would be one of the reasons why the appellant should be declared entitled, as against the respondent, to the issue of a patent including the claims in conflict as applied for by it, and, therefore, the point so raised would properly lead to the remedies prayed for by the appellant; and these remedies would be within the jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court, as being covered by paragraph (iv) of subs. 8 of sec. 44 of the Patent Act.\nIt should not be forgotten that we are dealing only with a judgment declaring that the Exchequer Court had no jurisdiction to hear and determine a point of that kind. The question whether the facts alleged by the appellant in paragraph (8) of the statement of claim give rise to the conclusions based upon them is a different matter which the Exchequer Court will have to decide when its jurisdiction to do so has been established.\nIt is undoubtedly true, as stated by the learned President, that the Exchequer Court has no jurisdiction to determine an issue purely and simply concerning a contract between subject and subject (His Majesty the King and Hume and Consolidated Distilleries Limited and Consolidated Exporters Corporation Limited[6]); but here the subject-matter of the appellant's allegation only incidentally refers to the contract of employment between John L. Kellogg, Jr., and the appellant. The allegation primarily concerns the invention alleged to have been made by him and of which the appellant claims to be the owner as a result of the contract and of the other facts set forth; in the allegation. The contract and the claims based thereon are advanced for the purpose of establishing that the appellant is entitled both to the rights deriving from the invention and to the issue of a patent in its own name. That is precisely the remedy which the Exchequer Court of Canada has the power to grant under paragraph (iv) of subs. 8 of sec. 44 of the Patent Act\nIn our view, there exists a further reason why the Exchequer Court should exercise jurisdiction upon the point raised by the appellant in its statement of claim, and that is the enactment contained in sec. 22, subs, (c), of the Exchequer Court Act (as amended by s. 3 of c. 23 of the Statutes of Canada of 1928). That subsection gives the Court\njurisdiction as well between subject and subject as otherwise, * * * *\n(c). in all other cases in which a remedy is sought under the authority of any Act of the Parliament of Canada or at Common Law or in Equity, respecting any patent of invention, copyright, trade mark, or industrial design.\nIt will be noticed that subsection (c) deals with the \"remedy\" which is sought. And it enacts that the Exchequer Court shall have jurisdiction between subject and subject in all cases where a \"remedy is sought\" \"respecting any patent of invention\" \"under the authority of any Act of the Parliament of Canada or at Common Law or in Equity.\" The remedy sought by the appellant, as a result of paragraph 8 of its statement of claim, is evidently a remedy in Equity respecting a patent of invention. The appellant claims that remedy as a consequence of the facts alleged in its paragraph 8. It claims the remedy as owner deriving its title from the same alleged inventor of whom the respondent claims to be the assignee, through other assignors. In such a case, the invention or the right to the patent for the invention is primarily the subject-matter of the appellant's claim, and the remedy sought for is clearly \"respecting any patent of invention.\" And this is covered by subsection (c) of section 22 of the Exchequer Court Act, as it stands at present.\nNo question was raised before us or before the Exchequer Court as to the constitutionality either of paragraph (iv) of subsection 8 of s. 44 of the Patent Act, or the constitutionality of subs, (c) of s. 22 of the Exchequer Court Act. No proceedings were directed to that issue. No notices to the Attorney-General of Canada, or to the Provincial Attorneys-General, were given of any intention to raise such a point. We are limiting our judgment to the interpretation of the relevant sections of the Exchequer Court Act and of the Patent Act as we find them in the statutes.\nUpon the construction of these sections, we are of opinion that the Exchequer Court has jurisdiction to hear and determine the issue raised by paragraph 8 of the appellant's statement of claim and by sub-paragraphs (c) and (d) of the conclusions.\nAccordingly the appeal is allowed and the parts of the statement of claim in question are restored. The appellant is entitled to its costs here and below.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Smart & Biggar.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Clark, Robertson, Macdonald & Connolly.\n[1] [1941] 1 D.L.R. 766.\n[2] [1935] S.C.R. 568, at 570.\n[3] [1937] S.C.R. 265, at 266.\n[4] [1930] S.C.R. 612.\n[5] [1933] S.C.R. 28.\n[6] [1930] S.C.R. 531.\n",

Hourigan, [1941] S.C.R. 251\nDate: 1941-02-04\nCharles W. Cox (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nGeorge F. Hourigan (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1940: December 2, 3; 1941: February 4.\nPresent: Duff C.J. and Crocket, Davis, Kerwin and Hudson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nContract\u2014Evidence\u2014Action to recover for alleged failure to return plant and equipment in accordance with agreement under seal\u2014Long lapse of time since said alleged breach\u2014Subsequent occurrences and course of conduct\u2014Alleged oral settlement as discharging cause of action by accord and satisfaction\u2014Corroboration under s. 11 of The Evidence Act, R.S.O., 1937, c. 119.\nIn an action for the value of plant and equipment alleged by plaintiff to have been loaned to defendant and not returned in accordance with an agreement under seal, and for damages for the alleged failure to return the same, this Court restored the judgment of the trial judge (which had been reversed by the Court of Appeal for Ontario) dismissing the action, in view of the many years which had elapsed since the alleged breach of contract, the subsequent occurrences and course of conduct, and the defendant\u2019s evidence, accepted by the trial judge, as to an oral agreement of settlement, fulfilled by him, of which evidence there were circumstances in support. Per Crocket and Kerwin JJ.: A cause of action arising from the breach of a contract may be discharged by accord and satisfaction, which need not be in writing or under seal even where the original contract was under seal (Blake\u2019s Case (1605) 6 Co. Rep. 43B; Steeds v. Steeds, 22 Q.B.D. 537).\nCorroboration within the meaning of s. 11 of The Evidence Act, R.S.O., 1937, c. 119, must be evidence of a material character supporting the case to be proved but it may be afforded by circumstances (McDonald v. McDonald, 33 Can. S.C.R. 145; Thompson v. Coulter, 34 Can. S.C.R. 261).\nAPPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario reversing the judgment of Urquhart J. dismissing the action in which the plaintiff claimed for the value of plant and equipment alleged to have been loaned to defendant and not returned in accordance with a certain agreement under seal dated December 27th, 1919, and for damages for the alleged failure to return the same. The original plaintiff in the action, which was begun on October 18, 1927, was James Horrigan Company Ltd. (sometimes in the reasons for judgment referred to as the respondent company), and after certain proceedings, transactions and events, the action was, by order to proceed made on March 10, 1937, continued at the suit of the present plaintiff (respondent). The material facts and circumstances of the case are sufficiently stated in the reasons for judgment in this Court now reported. The appeal was allowed and the judgment of Urquhart J. restored with costs throughout.\nA.W. Roebuck K.C. and H.F. Parkinson K.C. for the appellant.\nHamilton Cassels K.C. and Arthur Kearns for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2014I concur in the result.\nThe judgment of Crocket and Kerwin JJ. was delivered by\nKERWIN J.\u2014The writ of summons in this action was issued at the suit of James Horrigan Company, Limited, against Charles W. Cox on October 18th, 1927. The action was based upon an agreement, under seal, between the Company and Cox, dated December 27th, 1919, and was brought to recover the sum of $4,030.20, alleged to be due under the terms of that agreement, and interest thereon, and also the value (claimed to be in excess of $10,000) of certain lumbering plant and equipment stated to have been delivered by the Company to Cox and which, contrary to his covenant contained in the agreement, it was alleged that Cox had failed to return. The action was not tried until May, 1939.\nIn the interval, many events had occurred to some of which it is necessary to refer. For some unexplained reason Cox allowed default judgment to be signed and a writ of fieri facias to be issued but these were soon set aside, pleadings delivered, and the action ready for trial in December, 1927. However, an arrangement for the adjournment of the trial was made whereby Cox paid to the Company, or for its benefit, sums totalling approximately $3,930, or almost the amount of the item of $4,030.20 claimed in the action,\u2014without any allowance for interest. (It might here be stated that we agree with the trial judge and the Court of Appeal that these sums must be taken as payment of the item referred to and interest,\u2014leaving outstanding merely the claim for the plant and equipment.) It was also part of the arrangement for the adjournment of the trial that the Company should assign its claim to John O. Hourigan, the principal shareholder in the Company, and an agreement dated December 12th, 1927 (known as the arbitration agreement) was entered into between John O. Hourigan and Cox wherein, after reciting the Company\u2019s intention to assign the claim, provision was made for an arbitration if the parties were unable to settle the claim within six months.\nOn March 7th, 1928, the Company purported to assign the claim to John O. Hourigan, such claim then being, as indicated above, merely with reference to the plant and equipment. John O. Hourigan died intestate December 5th, 1930, leaving as his next of kin two sisters and two brothers, of whom George F. Hourigan was one. He and the Royal Trust Company were appointed administrators and on September 9th, 1933, they assigned to George F. Hourigan all the \u201cunrealized or non-liquid assets\u201d of the estate. While a schedule was attached to that assignment, the claim against Cox is not listed, and while the assignment contains a clause providing that nothing in the schedule should limit the generality of the words \u201cunrealized or non-liquid assets,\u201d the omission is significant and will be adverted to later. At the same time it has not been overlooked that George F. Hourigan already had a transfer of his surviving brother\u2019s one\u2011quarter interest in the estate and that so far as his sisters were concerned, he was merely a trustee for their share of any of the unrealized assets. No argument has been addressed to us as to the efficacy of these assignments and the appeal has proceeded as if George F. Hourigan would be entitled to secure judgment against Cox if the liability of the latter under the original agreement of December 27th, 1919, were established.\nVarious steps were taken by George F. Hourigan to nominate an arbitrator under the arbitration agreement but the only importance in connection therewith is that December 24th, 1935, being the approximate date when a notice was served on George F. Hourigan\u2019s behalf on Cox, was the first time in about eight years that any demand had been made on Cox by anyone for any claim under the original agreement of December 27th, 1919. In that demand, notice was given of the assignment by John O. Hourigan\u2019s administrators. The attempted arbitration proving abortive, George F. Hourigan, on September 26th, 1936, commenced a new action in his own name against Cox, advancing similar claims to those made in the present action. Upon Cox\u2019s application, proceedings in the new action were stayed and by an order to proceed, dated March 10th, 1937, the present action was continued at the suit of George F. Hourigan as party plaintiff.\nThe pleadings were amended and in the amended statement of defence Cox set up that there had been an accord and satisfaction of the claim for the plant and equipment. At the trial Cox\u2019s evidence in chief was that an oral agreement had been made between himself and John O. Hourigan subsequent to the date of the arbitration agreement of December 12th, 1927, whereby in consideration of Cox agreeing to purchase supplies for his future lumbering, operations from Marks & Co., in which John O. Hourigan was substantially interested, the claim under the agreement of December 27th, 1919, was satisfied. Cox also testified that he accordingly made all his purchases from Marks & Co. until it sold out its business to another con- cern about a year before the death of John O. Hourigan.\nIn cross-examination, counsel for the plaintiff put to Cox Question 10 on the latter\u2019s cross-examination on an affidavit filed on one of the motions in this action:\u2014\nMr. MCCOMBER: I want to read question 10:\n\u201cQ. After the date of that agreement, Exhibit 1 made between you and Mr. John O. Hourigan, December 12th, 1927, did you and Mr. Hourigan ever come to a settlement?\nA. We discussed it at various times, but there was never a definite settlement made.\u201d\nIs that answer correct?\nA. If it is there, that is correct, yes; it is correct, substantially correct.\nAfter some discussion between counsel, the cross-examination continued:\u2014\nBy Mr. MCCOMBER:\nQ. Now, you told us many times, yesterday, Mr. Cox, that you had discussed with John O. Hourigan, that you had discussions with John O. Hourigan in which there was an understanding that this action would not be gone on with. The fact of the matter is that there was no agreement to that effect; isn\u2019t that correct? A. No agreement?\nQ. Will you just answer the question; you have just said that the answer is no; the answer which I have just read: \u201cWe discussed it at various times, but there was never a definite settlement made.\u201d\nNow is that correct, that there was no definite settlement made?\nA. Well, there was no formal document drawn up; there was a definite understanding.\nQ. There was a definite understanding, but no definite settlement made; what do you mean by \u201cno definite settlement made\u201d?\nA. Well, there was no cash transaction, immediate cash transaction involved, and my paying anything to John Hourigan, but there was a clear-cut and definite understanding, but no formal document drawn up.\nQ. What is the meaning of this: \u201cThere was never a definite settlement made\u201d?\nA. That is what I mean by that, there was no formal document, nothing of that character; there was a definite understanding.\nQ. But, you say, there was a definite understanding.\nA. Very definite.\nQ. But it didn\u2019t amount to a settlement?\nA. Well, absolutely, yes. The understanding was the settlement.\nQ. So that when you answered \u201cWe discussed it at various times, but there was never a definite settlement made,\u201d you didn\u2019t mean just what that implies?\nA. Well, it means just what it implies, depending on the interpretation; there was no document drawn up, but there was a definite understanding.\nQ. Was the action dismissed? A. The Court action?\nQ. Was the action that was then pending when you were having those discussions with Hourigan, that is, after the arbitration agreement was drawn, was the action ever dismissed?\nA. Well, that was a part of the understanding, and Hourigan and I got together before the arbitration in order that we could make some disposition of the case, then on the understanding that it would be withdrawn from Court. On this all important point, the trial judge found that the arrangement was made as testified to by Cox in the witness box, saying in the course of his judgment, delivered immediately after the trial:\u2014\nNow, in this examination, in 1937, Cox made this statement: It is to be found on page 2, question 10 of this examination, that the date of the agreement between him and John O. Hourigan, was on December 12th, 1927; the question was asked, \u201cDid you and Mr. Hourigan ever make a settlement,\u201d or words to that effect, and Cox said, \u201cWe discussed it at various times, but there never was a definite settlement made.\u201d Cox was pressed on that, and he said in his evidence something to this effect, that what he meant by that, (and this was in cross-examination, I think) was that no formal document was ever drawn up; but that there was a clear-cut understanding or agreement. On the evidence I find that there was that understanding between Cox and Hourigan;\nThe Court of Appeal took the view that this finding was not justified but this was peculiarly a matter of the credibility of Cox and one as to which the trial judge was in the best position to decide. This Court had to consider the duty of an appellate court in dealing with findings of a trial judge in Lawrence v. Tew[1], where the most recent cases upon the subject are considered.\nIt appears that in addition to referring to Cox\u2019s examination-in-chief and that part of his cross\u2011examination mentioned above, the Court of Appeal relied on two affidavits made by Cox, for use on a motion by him in the second action brought by George F. Hourigan, proceedings in which had been stayed. Mr. Justice Fisher states that \u201call affidavits and cross\u2011examinations were filed as exhibits at the trial.\u201d The question as to whether this was an error was discussed at bar, and after Mr. Cassels, who had not been at the trial, had telephoned to Mr. McComber, we determined, after a very complete argument, that the affidavits referred to were not put in as evidence at the trial, that they were not in point of law before the Court of Appeal, and that they could not be used. It appears advisable to indicate the reasons for this conclusion.\nMr. W.F. Langworthy was called as a witness for the plaintiff. He had acted as solicitor for George F. Hourigan in connection with the attempted arbitration and had issued the writ in the second action. He testified:\u2014\nQ. Well then, what was the next step that you took on behalf of the Plaintiff? A. The next step was I issued a writ on the 26th of September, 1936, at the suit of George F. Hourigan against Charles W. Cox.\nQ. And what became of that action?\nA. I dropped out of it then; I don\u2019t know what happened after that.\nQ. This is the writ you referred to?\nA. That is the original writ, affidavit of service, and so on.\nHis LORDSHIP: That will be Exhibit No. 28.\nExhibit No. 28: Writ, affidavit of service and so on.\nQ. And do you know anything more about this matter? A. No, I don\u2019t know anything more; I dropped out then.\nMr. PARKINSON: No questions.\nThe only importance of Mr. Langworthy\u2019s evidence at that point was that the writ in the second action was issued on September 26th, 1936, and notwithstanding the words \u201cand so on\u201d the registrar of the trial court, in making up the list of exhibits, listed as Exhibit 28 merely \u201cOriginal writ and Proof of Service September 26, 1936,\u201d and that is all that was marked as Exhibit 28. Near the conclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s case, the following discussion occurred:\u2014\nMr. MCCOMBER: Now, my lord, I would like to read from the examination of the defendant on his affidavit, sworn to on the 22nd of March, 1937.\nMr. PARKINSON: My lord, cross-examination on an affidavit is not examination for discovery on file, and is not admissible as part of my friend\u2019s case.\nMr. MCCOMBER: I have heard of it being read.\nHis LORDSHIP: You have to read the whole document.\nMr. MCCOMBER: Pardon, my lord.\nHis LORDSHIP: You will have to read the whole document.\nMr. MCCOMBER: Well, then, I will file the whole document. This was the regular court reporter, Miss McBrady, who takes all the evidence here, my lord.\nHis LORDSHIP: I suppose she is still here.\nMr. MCCOMBER: Well, she is not here today.\nHis LORDSHIP: You see, it can only go in as admissions that he made, and someone that heard him make the admissions would have to come and swear that they heard them.\nMr. MCCOMBER: Mr. Cox is going to take the witness box.\nMr. PARKINSON: I know, but I don\u2019t want to be left in that position.\nHis LORDSHIP: You said there was no examination for discovery.\nMr. MCCOMBER: Yes, just a few weeks ago.\nHis LORDSHIP: Well, isn\u2019t that here?\nMr. MCCOMBER: Yes, it is here.\nHis LORDSHIP: Well, doesn\u2019t that cover the points in his affidavit? Mr. MCCOMBER: No. This examination I refer to was held in March, 1937.\nHis LORDSHIP: Well, show me the rule that says you can use it.\nMr. MCCOMBER: I would like to be understood to be anxious to file it, or to read it into the record.\nHis LORDSHIP: But that is not the point.\nMr. ROEBUCK: You can read it as soon as Mr. Cox goes in the box.\nWhen the defendant was in the box that part of his cross-examination on his affidavit, sworn to March 22nd, 1937, referred to, was read to him. No other cross-examination or affidavit was referred to and now that the matter has been fully investigated, it is clear that the affidavits which must have been sent to the Registrar of the Court of Appeal in error were never part of the evidence at the trial.\nA cause of action arising from the breach of a contract may be discharged by accord and satisfaction and this need not be in writing or under seal even where the original contract was under seal. Blake\u2019s Case[2]; Steeds v. Steeds[3]. It has been held by the Court of Appeal in England in British Russian Gazette and Trade Outlook Ltd. v. Associated Newspapers Ltd.[4], that where accord and satisfaction consisted in mutual promises there would be \u201csatisfaction\u201d in law even if the party who was to be released did not fulfil his promise. It is not here necessary to express any opinion upon that point, as Cox not only made the promise but executed it. Accord and satisfaction having been proved by testimony which the trial judge believed, we can find no ground upon which that finding may be set aside.\nIt was urged, however, that Cox\u2019s evidence required corroboration under section 11 of The Evidence Act, R.S.O., 1937, chapter 119:\u2014\nIn an action by or against the heirs, next of kin, executors, administrators or assigns of a deceased person, an opposite or interested party shall not obtain a verdict, judgment, or decision, on his own evidence, in respect of any matter occurring before the death of the deceased person, unless such evidence is corroborated by some other material evidence.\nGeorge F. Hourigan being treated as explained above, as having secured by assignment from the administrators of John O. Hourigan the right to sue, he is an assign within the meaning of the section. In McDonald v. McDonald[5] and Thompson v. Coulter[6], this Court established that corroboration must be evidence of a material character supporting the case to be proved but it may be afforded by circumstances. The working out of this rule is exemplified in the numerous cases in Ontario, to which our attention has been called.\nIn the present case, John O. Hourigan took no steps to arbitrate the claim after the six months\u2019 period mentioned in the arbitration agreement had expired; he made no demand of any kind upon Cox; his administrators made no claim; the assignment by the administrators (of whom George F. Hourigan was one) of what is described as non-liquid assets, made no reference to it and it was only in 1935 that George F. Hourigan presented a claim; W.T. McEachern, a former president of James Horrigan Company, Limited, whose evidence was taken de bene esse on behalf of the plaintiff, testified on cross-examination that John O. Hourigan had been anxious to retain Cox\u2019s business with Marks & Co.; and the respondent himself testified that Cox did continue to deal with Marks & Co. as long as it continued in business. In these facts and circumstances is found ample corroboration of the defendant\u2019s testimony that the arrangement he pleads was actually made and his promise fulfilled.\nThe appeal will be allowed and the judgment at the trial restored, with costs throughout.\nThe judgment of Davis and Hudson JJ. was delivered by\nDAVIS J.\u2014On December 27th, 1919, the appellant entered into an agreement under seal with the respondent company whereby he acquired the right to cut pulpwood on the company\u2019s timber limits near Port Arthur, Ont., during the cutting season 1919-1920. The appellant did in fact cut and remove a large quantity of the standing timber under the terms of the agreement but nothing turns on this appeal upon the pulpwood end of the agreement. The said agreement, however, had provided that the company would allow the appellant the use, free of any rental charge, of any part of its plant and equipment usually used in cutting and towing operations. Such plant and equipment as was taken was to be returned to the com- pany on or before June 16th, 1920, in the same condition and state of repair as the same was on the 1st day of September, 1919, less ordinary wear and tear; except that the booms and boom chains were to be returned as soon as the appellant had no further use for them in connection with his operations for the season 1919-1920. The plant and machinery was checked by the parties and an inventory thereof was made and attached to the agreement. Some 2,500 or more separate articles were listed in the inventory. The appellant admits that he took some but not a substantial portion of the plant and equipment and says he returned in due course that which he took, except a portion thereof which he was prohibited from returning by a notice served upon him by the Department of Lands and Forests of Ontario which made some claim at the time against the respondent company in respect of its Crown timber licences. The respondents say that the appellant took all the plant and equipment and did not return any of it.\nThe writ in this action, whereby the respondent company sought damages for the alleged failure of the appellant to return the plant and equipment, was not issued until October 18th, 1927. The claim became assigned by the company to John O. Hourigan on March 7th, 1928, and the latter died intestate on December 5th, 1930. The respondent George F. Hourigan, a brother of John O. Hourigan then deceased, as next of kin and as assignee of the other next of kin (a brother and two sisters), obtained on March 6th, 1937, an order of revival to proceed in his own name with the action. The action finally got down to trial in May, 1939. Urquhart J., the trial judge, dismissed the action with costs. On appeal the Court of Appeal for Ontario on February 16th, 1940, set aside the judgment at the trial and directed a reference to the Local Master at Port Arthur to take an account \u201cof what, if anything, is due\u201d to the respondent in respect of the claim for breach of contract to return the plant and equipment. The present appellant (defendant) then appealed to this Court.\nIf this appeal is dismissed it means that the Local Master at Port Arthur will be required to commence an inquiry to ascertain, (1) what part or parts of the said plant and equipment were taken by the appellant during the cutting season 1919-1920; (2) what part or parts so taken were not returned to the company on or before June 16th, 1920, except as to the booms and boom chains, and as to those, what booms and boom chains that were taken were not returned as soon as the appellant had no further use for them in connection with his operations for the season 1919\u20111920; (3) the value of the part or parts taken and not so returned as the same stood on September 1st, 1919, less ordinary wear and tear.\nWhat an inquiry this would be after so many years! I pick at random a few of the articles listed in the inventory merely to indicate the nature of such an inquiry: 9 sets of heavy team harness, 2 sets of driving harness, 17 horse collars, 17 sets of heavy log sleighs, 613 boom chains, 219 pairs of blankets, 26 lanterns, 28 lamps, 26 snow shovels, 1 blacksmith outfit (44 pieces), 107 granite plates, 106 granite tea cups, 6 enamel pails, 16 galvanized pails, 16 bread pans, 142 knives, 135 forks, 114 table spoons, 128 large spoons, 69 tea spoons, 16 wash basins, 19 milk jugs, 21 single bitted axes, 34 double bitted axes.\nThe law is well employed when it puts an end to such an inquiry being commenced after the lapse of over 21 years. Had the reference been directed at the trial, as the Court of Appeal thought it should have been, that was 19 years after the alleged breach. The appellant testified that he had settled the action years ago with the deceased Hourigan, and this evidence was accepted by the learned trial judge, who accordingly dismissed the action. While laches may not be a defence to a common law action, such delay as occurred here, taken with the numerous facts and circumstances related at the trial, tends in itself to make very probable the statement of the appellant that he had settled the claim with Hourigan years ago.\nI should allow the appeal and restore the trial judgment dismissing the action, with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Roebuck, Bagwell, McFarlane, Walkinshaw & Armstrong.\nSolicitors for the respondent: McComber & McComber.\n[1] [1939] 3 D.L.R. 273.\n[2] (1605) 6 Co.

The son, about seventeen years of age, was living with his parents on their farm, and he had no driver's licence. About one month prior to the accident the father went to Alberta on business and did not return until after the accident; and, before leaving, he gave instructions to his son not to use his automobile outside of the farm. In an action for damages the occupants of the other car recovered judgment against the father, the respondent; but the Court of Appeal dismissed the action on the ground that, during the father's absence, his son, the driver, was not \"living with and as a member of the family of\" the respondent within the meaning of section 74 (a) of the Motor Vehicle Act of British Columbia.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal (55 B.C.R. 350; [1940] 3 W.W.R. 81), that the father, respondent, was liable: during the latter's temporary absence from his home, his son had not ceased to live \"with and as a member of\" his family within the meaning of the above section. In such case, the driver is deemed to be the agent of the owner and the consent of the latter is immaterial.\nAs to the respondent's contention that section 45 of the Act (enacted before section 74A) makes the parent or guardian liable only when the automobile has been entrusted to the minor by the parent or guardian,\nHeld that the liability of the respondent as owner under section 74A does not disappear because all the conditions of section 45 do not exist. If the automobile had been entrusted to the son by his father, the respondent would then be liable as father under section 45 and as owner under section 74A. In the present case, the respondent is liable not because he is a father who has entrusted an automobile to a minor child, but because his automobile was driven by a \"person *** living with and as a member of\" his family. Section 74A deals with the liability of an owner, an entirely different thing from the responsibility of a parent or guardian, irrespective of ownership, which is dealt with in section 45.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], reversing the judgment of the trial judge, Murphy J. and dismissing the appellants' action for damages arising out of an automobile collision.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nJ. W. de B. Farris K.C. for the appellants.\nC. W. Hodgson for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and of Rinfret and Taschereau JJ. was delivered by\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014The appellants brought action against the respondent as a result of an automobile accident which happened on the highway between Vancouver and Chilliwack on September 30th, 1939. The Supreme Court of British Columbia maintained the action, but the Court of Appeal[2] held that the defendant who is the respondent before this Court could not be held liable for the negligence of his minor son, George, who was driving one of the automobiles, and allowed the appeal, dismissing the action.\nThere can be no doubt that the sole and determining cause of the accident was the negligence of George Lees, son of the defendant, in attempting to pass a motor car by driving on the wrong side of the road, when the appellants' oncoming car was so close that a collision was inevitable.\nThe trial judge adopted these views which have not been found erroneous by the Court of Appeal[3], and I see no valid reasons why this finding of facts should be set aside.\nThe learned judges of the Court of Appeal dismissed the action on the ground that George Lees at the time of the accident was not \"living with and as a member of the family of the defendant.\" They based their contention on section 74A of the Motor Vehicle Act which reads as follows:\u2014\n74A. (1) In an action for the recovery of loss or damage sustained by any person by reason of a motor-vehicle on any highway, every person driving or operating the motor-vehicle who is living with and as a member of the family of the owner of the motor-vehicle, and every person driving or operating the motor-vehicle who acquired possession of it with the consent, express or implied, of the owner of the motor-vehicle, shall be deemed to be the agent or servant of that owner and to be employed as such, and shall be deemed to be driving and operating the motor-vehicle in the course of his employment; but nothing in this section shall relieve any person deemed to be the agent or servant of the owner and to be driving or operating the motor-vehicle in the course of his employment from the liability for such loss or damage.\nThis section which was enacted in 1937 clearly stipulates that the owner cannot escape liability when the person driving the automobile \"is living with and as a member of the family of the owner.\" In such a case, the driver is deemed to be the agent of the owner and the consent of the latter is immaterial. This consent to the possession of the automobile by the driver is a necessary element to create liability, only when such driver is the person mentioned in the second part of the section.\nThe evidence reveals that at the time of the accident the respondent had gone to Alberta on a business trip where he expected to spend a few months, and the Court of Appeal held that during this absence, his son, George Lees, the driver, was not living with and as a member of the family of the respondent within the meaning of section 74A.\nWith respect, I cannot agree with these views and I cannot come to the conclusion that during the period of the temporary absence of the defendant from his home, the wife and son of the defendant had ceased to live with and as members of his family. On this ground, the contention of the respondent cannot prevail, and I fail to see how he can escape liability.\nBut the respondent now invokes section 45 of the Motor-Vehicle Act, which says:\u2014\n45. In case a minor is living with or as a member of the family of his parent or guardian, the parent or guardian shall be civilly liable for loss or damage sustained by any person through the negligence or improper conduct of the minor in driving or operating on any highway a motor-vehicle entrusted to the minor by the parent or guardian; but nothing in this section shall relieve the minor from liability therefor. In every action brought against the parent or guardian of a minor in respect of any cause of action otherwise within the scope of this section, the burden of proving that the motor-vehicle so driven or operated by the minor was not entrusted to the minor by the parent or guardian shall be on the defendant. 1935, c. 50, s. 45.\nThe respondent's contention is that this section makes the parent or guardian liable only when the automobile has been entrusted to the minor by the parent or guardian. It is true, and there is evidence that the respondent before leaving for Alberta had given instructions to his son not to use his automobile, and it is argued that such being the case, the automobile had not been entrusted to the minor son.\nSection 45 was enacted before section 74A and until the latter was introduced in the Act, there was no text of law imposing a liability upon the owner of an automobile driven by another person. This liability attached by section 45 to the parent or guardian is irrespective of ownership, and exists when the automobile is entrusted by one of them to the minor. If the respondent had not been the owner of the car, section 45 could be of some help to him but such is not the case. The responsibility created by section 74A enacted in 1937, has its very foundation on ownership. This section covers a much wider field than section 45, and applies to every person even to the parent or guardian when they happen to be owners of automobiles and when the driver lives with and as a member of the family.\nIn the present case, the respondent is liable not because he is a father who has entrusted an automobile to a minor child, but because his automobile was driven by a person living with and as a member of his family.\nIf the automobile had been entrusted to George Lees by his father, the respondent would then be liable as father under section 45, and as owner under section 74A, but it cannot be said that the liability as owner under section 74A disappears because all the conditions of section 45 do not exist.\nIt would be strange if it were otherwise, and if we were to construe these two sections as suggested by the respondent. As pointed out by Mr. Farris K.C. for the appellant, a father owner of an automobile would not be liable for the negligence of his minor son of twenty years of age, living with or as a member of his family, unless the car were entrusted to the son by the father, but the following year, when the son has reached the age of majority, such liability would exist. This is surely not the letter nor the spirit of the law.\nFor these reasons, I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed, and that the judgment of the trial judge should be restored with costs throughout.\nKERWIN J.\u2014On September 30th, 1939, while in a motor car on a highway in British Columbia, the appellants were injured, and the motor car in which they were driving was damaged, by coming into collision with a motor car driven by George Lees. George Lees was a young man seventeen years of age, who did not have a permit to drive but who, at the time, was driving a motor car owned by his father, James Lees, the respondent in this appeal. The accident was found by the trial judge to be due to the negligence of George Lees and judgment was given for the appellants against the respondent. On appeal, the finding of negligence was confirmed but the three members of the Court of Appeal being of opinion that no liability attached to the respondent, set aside the judgment and dismissed the action.\nThe question as to the respondent's liability depends upon the construction of subsection 1 of section 74A of the British Columbia Motor Vehicle Act, R.S.B.C., 1936, chapter 195, as enacted by section 11 of chapter 54 of the statutes of 1937, which subsection reads as follows:\u2014\nIn an action for the recovery of loss or damage sustained by any person by reason of a motor-vehicle on any highway, every person driving or operating the motor-vehicle who is living with and as a member of the family of the owner of the motor-vehicle, and every person driving or operating the motor-vehicle who acquired possession of it with the consent, express or implied, of the owner of the motor-vehicle, shall be deemed to be the agent or servant of that owner and to be employed as such, and shall be deemed to be driving and operating the motor-vehicle in the course of his employment; but nothing in this section shall relieve any person deemed to be the agent or servant of the owner and to be driving or operating the motor-vehicle in the course of his employment from the liability for such loss or damage.\nOur attention was not called to any provision in the earlier Motor Vehicles Acts of the province imposing civil liability upon the owner of a motor vehicle, such liability apparently depending upon the general law. By section 12 of chapter 44 of the 1926-27 Statutes, section 18A was added to the then Act (R.S.B.C., 1924, c. 177). This section is as follows:\u2014\nSo long as a minor is living with or as a member of the family of his parent or guardian, the parent or guardian shall be civilly liable for loss or damage sustained by any person through the negligence or improper conduct of the minor in driving or operating a motor-vehicle on any highway; but nothing in this section shall relieve the minor from liability therefor.\nIn 1929, by section 7 of chapter 44, this section was amended by striking out the words \"a motor vehicle on any highway\" and substituting therefor \"on any highway a motor vehicle entrusted to the minor by the parent or guardian.\"\nAs thus amended this provision in substance is now found as section 45 in the Revised Statutes of 1936. This section seems to impose a liability upon a parent or guardian under the conditions therein set forth, irrespective of whether or not the appellant or guardian was the owner. Section 74 deals with the responsibility of the owner for any violation of the Act, etc., by any person entrusted by the owner with the possession of a motor vehicle. Then, in 1937, came section 74A, subsection 1 of which is quoted above. This subsection deals with the responsibility of the owner for the acts of \"every person driving or operating the motor vehicle, who is living with and as a member of the family of the owner of the motor vehicle, and every person driving or operating the motor vehicle who acquires possession of it with the consent, express or implied, of the owner.\"\nIn my view, the legislature, by its latest enactment, was dealing with the responsibility of an owner, an entirely different thing from the responsibility of a parent or guardian irrespective of ownership. Even if that were not so, I would be disposed to think that the 1937 legislation treats alike every person living with and as a member of the family of the owner of a motor vehicle, whether that person was or was not a minor.\nIn the present case, George Lees was certainly living as a member of his father's family in British Columbia and in my view he was also living with his father even though the latter was absent for a short time in Alberta. It is undoubted that the father resided in British Columbia and that his home was with the members of his family. With respect I consider that he was living with them, and that his son was living with him, notwithstanding his temporary absence. The fact that the father prohibited the son from driving or operating the car on the highway is immaterial as the acquiring possession of it, with the consent, express or implied, of the owner, does not apply to one who was living with and as a member of the family of the owner.\nI would not interfere with the finding of negligence by the trial judge, concurred in by the Court of Appeal and the appeal should therefore be allowed and the judgment at the trial restored with costs throughout.\nHUDSON J.\u2014This action was brought for damages for personal injuries sustained by the plaintiffs in an automobile accident. A motor car driven by a son of the defendant, George Lees, collided with the car driven by the plaintiffs. It was alleged that George Lees was the agent or servant of the defendant and, further, that the defendant\nwas the owner of the motor car driven by the said George Lees and that the said George Lees was then living with and as part of the family of the said defendant and had acquired possession of the said motor car with the consent of the defendant.\nThe trial judge held that the accident was due to the negligence of George Lees and that the car was the property of the defendant and that George Lees, his son, was then living with and as part of his family.\nIt appeared from the evidence that George Lees was driving the car without the consent of his father and probably against his express wishes. The trial judge gave judgment to the plaintiffs, holding that the defendant was liable under the provisions of section 74A of the Motor Vehicle Act, R.S.B.C., 1936, as amended by 1937, chapter 54, section 11.\nOn appeal the Court of Appeal reversed this decision and held that the defendant was not liable under the section which reads as follows:\u2014\nIn an action for the recovery of loss or damage sustained by any person by reason of a motor vehicle on any highway, every person driving or operating the motor vehicle who is living with and as a member of the family of the owner of the motor vehicle, and every person driving or operating the motor vehicle who acquired possession of it with the consent, express or implied, of the owner of the motor vehicle, shall be deemed to be the agent or servant of that owner and to be employed as such, and shall be deemed to be driving and operating the motor vehicle in the course of his employment; but nothing in this section shall relieve any person deemed to be the agent or servant of the owner and to be driving or operating the motor vehicle in the course of his employment from the liability for such loss or damage.\nIt is no longer in question that the plaintiffs suffered loss or damage by reason of a motor vehicle on a highway, that such motor vehicle was owned by the defendant and driven by his son and that the accident was caused by the son's negligence. Nor is it open to doubt that the defendant's son was a member of his family.\nTwo of the learned judges in appeal thought the son was not living with the defendant within the meaning of the statute and, for that reason, excused him. With respect, I cannot agree with this view.\nIt is unnecessary for me to repeat the evidence which has already been set out by the other members of the court, but I think that any reasonable interpretation of the language \"living with\" would bring the defendant's son and the defendant within the provisions of this section. It was the family home where father, mother and children all normally resided and mere temporary absences did not in my opinion alter the situation.\nThere is another point which raises a more difficult question. In the Motor-Vehicle Act which is incorporated in the Revised Statutes of British Columbia, 1936, there is a section 45 which reads as follows:\u2014\nIn case a minor is living with or as a member of the family of his parent or guardian, the parent or guardian shall be civilly liable for loss or damage sustained by any person through the negligence or improper conduct of the minor in driving or operating on any highway a motor vehicle entrusted to the minor by the parent or guardian; but nothing in this section shall relieve the minor from liability therefor. In every action brought against the parent or guardian of a minor in respect of any cause of action otherwise within the scope of this section, the burden of proving that the motor vehicle so driven or operated by the minor was not entrusted to the minor by the parent or guardian shall be on the defendant.\nand this section has not been specifically repealed.\nIt is argued that section 45, dealing with a particular and more limited class, shoud be construed as if still applying to cases like the present and be thereby excluded from the provisions of 74A, which was introduced into the Act at a later date. It should be noted that section 74A deals with the liability of owners and that 45 deals with the liability of parents, whether they be owners or not. Section 45 creates a liability where the motor vehicle has been \"entrusted\" by the parent to the person driving at the time of the accident. Section 74A is not inconsistent with 45 but more comprehensive, enlarging the liability, and it should be noted too that in the latter part of the section it deals with entrustment, and such entrustment is to persons other than a child or person living with the possessor.\nIn my opinion section 74A covers the case and the defendant is liable. I would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeal and restore the judgment at trial, with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Farris, Farris, McAlpine, Stultz, Bull & Farris.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Sullivan & McQuarrie.\n[1] (1940) 55 B.C.R. 350; [1940] 3 W.W.R. 81; [1940] 4 D.L.R. 330.\n[2] (1940) 55 B.C.R. 350; [1940] 3 W.W.R. 81; [1940] 4 D.L.R. 330.\n[3] (1940) 55 B.C.R. 350; [1940] 3 W.W.R. 81; [1940] 4 D.L.R. 330.\n",

A petition of right lies in the Exchequer Court to enforce these rights (Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 34, ss. 18, 37, and Petition of Right Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 158, ss. 2 (c), 10, considered). A claim for a declaration of the patentee's rights as above (supported by sufficient allegations of facts), is a claim for \"relief\" within the meaning of s. 2 (c) of the Petition of Right Act (defining \"relief\") and of s. 18 of the Exchequer Court Act. The relief granted (on establishment of the necessary facts) would be a declaration of said rights (Attorney-General of Victoria v. Ettershank, L.R. 6 P.C. 354; Dominion Bldg. Corp. v. The King [1933] A.C. 533, at 548; Attorney-General v. De Keyser's Royal Hotel, [1920] A.C. 508, cited). Judgment granting such relief is not a mere declaratory judgment in any pertinent sense; it is a judgment establishing the right to appropriate relief in the only form in which that can be done in a judgment against the Crown.\nRights of the Crown, if any, under s. 46 of the Patent Act, 1935, should be taken into account in passing on the patentee's claim to relief.\nJudgment of Maclean J., [1941] Ex. C.R. 1, affirmed (with a variation of the order in the Exchequer Court, so as to make clearer the suppliant's rights).\nAPPEAL by the Crown from the judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], deciding certain points of law in favour of the suppliant.\nThe suppliant's petition of right alleged that there had been granted to him and he was the owner of certain Canadian Letters Patent (described); that since the date of issue thereof the Crown had constructed and used in Canada the improvements embodying the invention described therein, without compensating the suppliant; that the suppliant had made requests for admission of such use and payment of compensation therefor, but the Crown denied liability; that the suppliant had applied to the Commissioner of Patents to fix compensation under s. 19 of the Patent Act, and the Commissioner refused to fix compensation until use of the device was first established either by admission by the Crown or by judgment of the Court; that by reason of the acts of the Crown the suppliant had suffered loss of proper compensation; and, by paragraph 6, prayed as follows:\n(a) A declaration that the respondent has constructed and used the subject-matter of the Letters Patent No. 361,335 aforesaid.\n(b) A declaration that the hereinbefore recited Letters Patent are good, valid and subsisting Letters Patent.\n(c) That the Commissioner of Patents be directed under section 19 of the Patent Act, being Chapter 32 of the Statutes of 1935, to ascertain and report what shall be a reasonable compensation to the suppliant by the respondent for its said use of the said invention. (d) That the respondent be condemned to pay to your suppliant the amount of compensation so found to be reasonable for the use thereof, by the Commissioner of Patents.\n(e) Such further and other relief as the nature of the case may require and to the Court shall seem just.\n(f) Costs.\nThe Crown in its statement of defence admitted receipt of communications with reference to the alleged use of certain Letters Patent; admitted applications by the suppliant to the Commissioner to fix compensation and the latter's refusal to do so until use of the device had been established by admission of the Department involved or by means of a court action; disputed the suppliant's other allegations; denied liability for compensation; alleged that any grant to the suppliant of such Letters Patent for the alleged invention was invalid for reasons set out; and raised certain other defences. It also submitted that the petition of right was insufficient and bad in substance and in law in that it did not claim any relief against the Crown or allege any facts giving rise to any liability for which the Crown was bound or might be adjudged to respond, and, moreover, that if any relief were claimed in the petition of right it was not relief for which under the law and practice a petition of right would lie.\nUpon motion of the suppliant, an order was made in the Exchequer Court for hearing and disposal before trial of the following questions, as questions of law arising from the pleadings, namely:\n(1) Assuming the patent in suit to be valid and the invention covered thereby to have been used by the respondent, is the suppliant entitled in law to any of the remedies claimed against the respondent in respect of the use by the respondent of the patented invention, and\n(2) If so, does a Petition of Right lie to enforce such remedy or remedies?\nMaclean J. held that the law points submitted for decision must be determined in the affirmative. The formal order provided:\nThis court doth order and adjudge that the first question of law as above set out be answered in the affirmative with respect to the remedies claimed in sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) of paragraph 6 of the Petition of Right herein.\nAnd this court doth further order and adjudge that the second question of law as above set out be and the same is hereby answered in the affirmative. Leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was granted to the Crown by a Judge of this Court.\nF. P. Varcoe K.C. and W. R. Jackett for the appellant.\nH. G. Fox K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice\u2014This appeal raises two questions, a question of substantive law and a question of procedure. The question of law concerns the construction and effect of section 19 of the Patent Act, which is in these terms:\u2014\nThe Government of Canada may, at any time, use any patented invention, paying to the patentee such sum as the Commissioner reports to be a reasonable compensation for the use thereof, and any decision of the Commissioner under this section shall be subject to appeal to the Exchequer Court.\nOn behalf of the Crown it is contended that payment under this section is a payment ex gratia and that the patentee has no legal right to demand it. It is no disparagement of the argument of counsel on behalf of the Crown to say that, in my opinion, it is very clear that the words \"paying to the patentee such sum as the Commissioner reports to be a reasonable compensation for the use thereof\" vest in the patentee a legal right.\nIn my view of section 19, if the conditions under which the section comes into operation are fulfilled, that is to say, if the patentee has a valid patent and his invention has been used by the Crown in the sense of the section, if these conditions subsist then the patentee has the right to be paid by the Crown reasonable compensation, as ascertained and reported by the Commissioner, subject, of course, to the appeal provided for. This involves necessarily the right to have such compensation ascertained and reported. I think, moreover, that the section contemplates a reference of the question of compensation by the Crown to the Commissioner and, accordingly, by necessary implication, that he has the right to have that question referred.\nI have come to this conclusion apart from the contention of Mr. Fox that under the patent law of Canada a patentee becomes invested with the right to use by himself and his licensees his invention to the exclusion of the Crown, as well as of others. That contention raises a very important question and, I very humbly think, a question of some difficulty, upon which it seems inadvisable to express any opinion until a case arises in which it appears to be necessary to decide it.\nSo much for the respondent's substantive rights. I have no doubt that a Petition of Right lies in the Exchequer Court to enforce these rights. The sections with which we are immediately concerned are sections 18 and 37 of the Exchequer Court Act, and sections 2 (c) and 10 of the Petition of Right Act, chap. 158, R.S.C., 1927. They are as follows:\u2014\nThe Exchequer Court Act\n18. The Exchequer Court shall have exclusive original jurisdiction in all cases in which demand is made or relief sought in respect of any matter which might, in England, be subject of a suit or action against the Crown, and for greater certainty, but not so as to restrict the generality of the foregoing terms, it shall have exclusive original jurisdiction in all cases in which the land, goods or money of the subject are in the possession of the Crown, or in which the claim arises out of a contract entered into by or on behalf of the Crown.\n37. Any claim against the Crown may be prosecuted by petition of right, or may be referred to the Court by the head of the department in connection with the administration of which the claim arises.\n2. If any such claim is so referred no fiat shall be given on any petition of right in respect thereof.\nThe Petition of Right Act\n2. (c) \"relief\" includes every species of relief claimed or prayed for in a petition of right, whether a restitution of any incorporeal right or a return of lands or chattels, or payment of money, or damages, or otherwise.\n10. The judgment on every petition of right shall be that the suppliant is not entitled to any portion, or that he is entitled to the whole or to some specified portion of the relief sought by his petition, or to such other relief, and upon such terms and conditions, if any, as are just.\nSection 18 is very broadly expressed. It may be of historical interest to notice that in the form in which it first appeared (section 75(2) of chap. 135, of the Consolidated Statutes of 1886) the words were\nin all cases in which demand is made or relief sought in respect of any matter which might, in England, have been the subject of a suit or action in the Court of Exchequer on its revenue side against the Crown.\nIt was in the Statute of 1887 that the present section 18 assumed its present form as section 15 of that Statute, and section 37 as section 23. These sections simplify the procedure in the Exchequer Court in relation to petitions of right. Section 18 extends the jurisdiction of the Court to all those cases in which, the interests of the Crown being directly concerned, a bill could be filed, pursuant to a fiat, in the Court of Chancery as well as in the Exchequer, against the Attorney-General as representing the Crown, or in which he could be made a party. The jurisdiction and practice of the Court of Chancery in this respect did not differ from the equity jurisdiction and practice of the Court of Exchequer, as is fully explained by Lord Buck-master in his judgment in Esquimau and Nanaimo Railway Co. v. Wilson[2] in the Judicial Committee.\nI must not be understood as intimating an opinion that section 18 gives the Exchequer Court jurisdiction to entertain a proceeding such as that in Dyson v. Attorney-General[3], where an action was brought against the Attorney-General in the ordinary way without a fiat and the claim was only for a declaration that the plaintiff was under no obligation to comply with the provisions of a notice issued by the Commissioners of Inland Revenue; and no relief in respect of money, or property, or incorporeal right was claimed against the Crown. I shall refer more particularly to this class of action presently.\nI do not think there is any real processual difficulty in the way of the suppliant in respect of the relief which this petition of right claims in substance. When the whole of paragraph 6 is read, the relief claimed in substance is a declaration that the respondent is entitled to be paid reasonable compensation for the use of his invention under section 19 of the Patent Act. There is a prayer for further and other relief and the facts alleged are sufficient to support such a claim. Amendment of paragraph 6 could only be in point of form and I think it unnecessary. If it were necessary, it should be made. Such a claim, I have no doubt, is a claim for \"relief\" within the meaning of the definition of relief quoted above from the Petition of Right Act and within the meaning of section 18 of the Exchequer Court Act. In the nature of things the Court does not and cannot make a mandatory order against the Crown; but the Court can and does declare the rights of the suppliant as between the suppliant and the Crown in cases of specific performance. This is well illustrated in The Attorney-General of Victoria v. Ettershank[4], where the claim to relief was based upon a statutory provision which gave to the lessees of Crown lands the right on certain conditions to acquire a title in fee simple to their allotments. The Crown had contended that the lease was forfeited, and judgment was given on the petition of right declaring that the suppliant was entitled to the benefit of the lease and to the right of purchasing the fee simple of the land, provided he paid the rent due within three months. The statutory provision was treated as introducing a statutory term into the lease. Such a judgment is a declaration that the suppliant is entitled to the relief of specific performance. The subject's right to relief is declared by the Court in full assurance that the Crown will give effect to the right so declared. In the Judicial Committee Sir Montague Smith in Attorney-General of Victoria v. Ettershank4 referred to a judgment as a decree for specific performance. Lord Tomlin's observations to a similar effect in Dominion Bldg. Corp. v. The King[5] merely stated the settled and well understood practice.\nThis, of course, is a vastly different thing from a judgment such as that in Dyson v. Attorney-General[6] (supra), which does not declare or decide that the subject is entitled to have something done in order to give effect to his legal rights as against the Crown, or that he is entitled to property or some interest therein, or to the possession thereof. The proceeding by petition of right is not applicable to such a claim as that in question in Dyson v. Attorney-General6. Such a proceeding is only competent where a petition of right does not lie. (Esquimalt and Nanaimo Rly. Co. v. Wilson[7]). It should not be overlooked that the Board in that case gave only a limited approval to the decision in Dyson's case (3); as to one incidental point.\nThe validity, in my view of the effect of section 19, of the suppliant's claims in substance, on the facts stated, is conclusively established by the Attorney-General v. De Keyser's Royal Hotel[8]. In that case, as Lord Moulton said at p. 551, the acquisition having been made under the Defence Act, 1842, \"the suppliants are entitled to the compensation provided by that Act.\" Lord Parmoor explained at p. 580 that in an ordinary case, under the Lands Clauses Acts, when promoters enter into possession of lands in conformity with their statutory rights, and delay or refuse to put in force the necessary procedure for the assessment of compensation in default of agreement, the remedy is by mandamus. That remedy, as he observed, would not be applicable against the Crown; and, as Lord Dunedin says at p. 531, Petition of Right does no more than enable the subject to sue the Crown in such a case. The declaration of the Court of Appeal, to which no exception was taken, was in these words:\u2014\nAnd this Court doth declare that the Suppliants are entitled to a fair rent for use and occupation of De Keyser's Royal Hotel on the Thames Embankment in the City of London by way of compensation under the Defence Act, 1842.\nThe respondent is, assuming the invention has been used within the meaning of section 19 and his patent is a valid patent, entitled to reasonable compensation, pursuant to the terms of that section, and if the facts are established he is entitled to judgment to that effect. Such a judgment is not a mere declaratory judgment in any pertinent sense. It is a judgment establishing his right to appropriate relief in the only form in which that can be done in a judgment against the Crown.\nI find myself in difficulty, however, with regard to the formal order made in the Court below. It seems to decide that the respondent could be entitled and only entitled to a judgment in the sense of sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) of clause 6 of the Petition of Right. A Petition of Right plainly would not lie for claims limited to paragraph 6 (a) and (b) which claim no relief. I think there must have been some mistake in drawing up the order. Under such an order the suppliant is not entitled to relief in any form. It does not deal with the substance of the controversy as to his rights, which is whether, on the one hand, he has a legal right to payment on establishing the facts, or, on the other, as the Crown contends, the enactment only authorizes a payment ex gratia. It leaves, moreover, untouched his right to have his compensation determined in the manner prescribed, which ought to be declared, as I have explained. If the order as it is expressed denies him relief in respect of these matters, then it ought-to be made clear that such is not its effect and that they will be dealt with at a later stage of these proceedings.\nI should dismiss the appeal, subject, however, to a variation of the order of the learned trial judge, making it clear that the suppliant's right to relief under section 19 of the Patent Act and his right to have his claim in that respect disposed of in this action are not prejudiced by the judgment appealed from, and that the remaining questions in controversy are reserved to be disposed of later.\nWhat I have said does not touch upon the rights of the Crown under section 46 of the Patent Act. In passing on the respondent's claim to relief, these rights, if any, will, of course, be taken into account.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs, subject to the reservation explained.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W. Stuart Edwards.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Harold G. Fox.\n[1] [1941] Ex.

S., a general repair man in respondent\u2019s employ, and whose duties took him to various premises of respondent, had made a key in respondent\u2019s shops in West Toronto and was instructed by his foreman to take it to respondent\u2019s premises in North Toronto to try it in the lock for which it was intended. S. was entitled to be paid for the time occupied in such an errand. Means of transport were available for his use\u2014vehicles which could be run on respondent\u2019s railway, and street-cars for which respondent would provide tickets. On the occasion in question no instruction was given by the foreman to S. as to mode of transportation. Notices had been given by the respondent to its employees (and brought to S.\u2019s attention) for bidding use of privately owned automobiles in connection with respondent\u2019s business unless the owner carried insurance against public J liability and property damage risks. In taking the key as aforesaid, S. drove his own automobile, in respect of which he did not have insurance, and on his way he negligently (as found by the jury at trial) struck and injured appellant. The chief question on the present appeal (treated by the trial judge as a question of law, and as to which no questions were referred to the jury) was as to respondent\u2019s liability to appellant.\nHeld: Respondent was liable. The question whether a master is liable for injuries caused to third persons by his servant\u2019s negligence depends upon whether under all the circumstances the servant at the time of the negligence was acting in the course of his employment, and, if he was so acting, liability attaches to the master even though the servant was doing something forbidden by the master. Upon the circumstances and facts in evidence, it must be held that S. at the time of the negligence was acting in the course of his employment within the meaning and application of the above rule.\nCases reviewed.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, [1940] O.R. 140 (affirming judgment of Rose, C.J.H.C., [1939] O.R. 517) reversed.\nHeld, further, that the facts that judgment had been entered against S. on appellant\u2019s behalf, and on behalf of his father, by whom as next friend appellant, an infant, had sued, and that his father had, in his personal capacity, taken proceedings to secure by way of attachment part of his own damages awarded against S., did not operate to end appellant\u2019s cause of action against respondent so as to nullify appellant\u2019s right of appeal.\nHeld, further, that though the amount of damages claimed on appellant\u2019s behalf in the statement of claim was $5,000, and no amendment was applied for until after the jury\u2019s verdict, when the trial judge allowed an amendment to cover the sum awarded, namely, $10,000, the judgment for the sum awarded should not be disturbed\nAPPEAL by the plaintiffs from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] dismissing their appeal from the judgment of Rose, C.J.H.C.[2] dismissing, as against the defendant Canadian Pacific Railway Com- pany, their action for damages by reason of injuries caused to the infant plaintiff when he was struck by an automobile being driven by the defendant Stinson, who was an employee of the defendant company.\nAt trial, before Rose, C.J.H.C., and a jury, the jury, in answer to questions submitted to them, found that the infant plaintiff\u2019s injuries were caused by negligence of Stinson, and judgment was given against Stinson for the amounts of damages found by the jury. No appeal was taken by Stinson. No question as to liability of the defendant company was left to the jury, as the trial judge considered that the facts upon which the question turned were not in dispute and that the question was one of law. He later gave judgment dismissing the action as against the company. An appeal by the plaintiffs from this judgment was dismissed by the Court of Appeal (McTague J.A. dissenting). The plaintiffs appealed to this Court.\nThe plaintiffs were Leonard Lockhart, an infant, suing by his next friend (his father) Joseph Lockhart, and the said Joseph Lockhart. The latter claimed on his own behalf for expenses incurred, and his damages found by the jury at the trial were $500. As this was less than the statutory amount for appeal to this Court, and as he had not obtained leave to appeal, the dismissal of his claim as against the defendant company by the trial judge, affirmed by the Court of Appeal, stands.\nThe material facts and circumstances of the case, with regard to the questions before this Court on the appeal, are sufficiently stated in the reasons for judgment now reported. The appeal was allowed and the infant plaintiff was given judgment against the defendant company for the amount of the jury\u2019s verdict (as of July 12, 1939, the date of the judgment of the trial judge dismissing the action as against the defendant company), with costs throughout.\nD.J. Walker and C.M. Milton for the appellants.\nW.N. Tilley K.C. and J.Q. Maunsell K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Davis J. was delivered by THE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2014This appeal raises a question concerning the application to the facts of the case of the principle governing the responsibility of a master for the negligence of his servant.\nThe servant was one Stinson who was an employee of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company and who had been in the service of the Company for something like twenty-five years. He was a carpenter and his duties consisted mainly in doing repairs on the buildings and cars of the Company in Toronto and in its neighbourhood. On the day when the accident happened he had a key which, on the instructions of McLeod, his immediate superior (who is described as a bridge and building foreman), he had made for use in a lock at the premises of the Company in North Toronto. His usual place of work was at the Company\u2019s station in West Toronto and he had made the key in the shops there. He informed the foreman that it was necessary to take the key to North Toronto in order to try it in the lock, and the foreman instructed him to do so. On his way to North Toronto, driving his own automobile, he ran down the infant plaintiff, and the action was instituted by the infant and the infant\u2019s father against Stinson and the Railway Company, charging Stinson with negligence.\nIn the course of his duties Stinson was obliged at times to go to places in and outside of Toronto. Means of transport, it is said, were available for his use in such cases. There were vehicles which could be run on the respondent\u2019s railway and there were the street-cars by which he could travel when it was more convenient to do so. He was forbidden, it is said, to use his own car in the Company\u2019s business unless it was insured; and in any case, it is argued, he was not employed to drive an automobile and his negligence in the course of doing so was not negligence in the course of his employment.\nThe question is one of considerable difficulty. The best statement of the general principle is, I think, in the passages quoted from Story and adopted by Lord Macnaghten in Lloyd v. Grace, Smith & Co.[3] Lord Macnaghten\u2019s opinion is expressely concurred in by Lords Atkinson and Shaw.\nI venture to quote Story\u2019s opinion, not only because it is the considered opinion of a most distinguished lawyer, but also because it is cited apparently with approval in the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, consisting of Cockburn C.J., Blackburn, Mellor, and Lush JJ., by Blackburn J. himself in a case which occurred in the interval between the date of Barwick\u2019s case[4] and the decision in Houldsworth v. City of Glasgow Bank[5]. The passage in the judgment of Blackburn J. as reported in McGowan & Co. v. Dyer[6] is as follows: \u201cIn Story on Agency, the learned author states, in s. 452, the general rule that the principal is liable to third persons in a civil suit \u2018for the frauds, deceits, concealments, misrepresentations, torts, negligences, and other malfeasances or misfeasances, and omissions of duty of his agent in the course of his employment, although the principal did not authorize, or justify, or participate in, or indeed know of such misconduct, or even if he forbade the acts, or disapproved of them.\u2019 He then proceeds, in. s. 456: \u2018But although the principal is thus liable for the torts and negligences of his agent, yet we are to understand the doctrine with its just limitations, that the tort or negligence occurs in the course of the agency. For the principal is not liable for the torts or negligences of his agent in any matters beyond the scope of the agency, unless he has expressly authorized them to be done, or he has subsequently adopted them for his own use and benefit.\u2019\u201d\nIt does not follow that the act of the servant which is the subject of complaint is not within the class of acts for which the master is responsible because, as between the master and the servant, it constitutes a breach of the master\u2019s orders or is a \u201cbreach of authority\u201d as defined by such orders. As Willes J. said in Bayley v. Manchester[7], the master \u201chas his remedy against the servant for misconduct and breach of authority as between them,\u201d although a third person has his remedy against: both of them. In Whitfield v. Turner[8], Knox C.J., in a judgment in which the other members of the High Court of Australia concurred, said:\nThe fact that Spinney\u2019s authority to light a fire was only given to him in case of a certain emergency happening is nothing to the point. Lighting a fire was an act of a class which he had authority to do under-certain circumstances. Whether the circumstances did or did not exist might be very relevant as between Spinney and his employer, but is not relevant as between his employer and the plaintiff.\nIn Hamlyn v. Houston[9], Collins M.R. said:\nThe principal having delegated the performance of a certain class of acts to the agent, it is not unjust that he, being the person who has appointed the agent, and who will have the benefit of his efforts if successful, should bear the risk of his exceeding his authority in matters incidental to the doing of the acts the performance of which has been delegated to him. In Lloyd v. Grace, Smith & Co.[10], the question to be determined was the responsibility of a solicitor for a clerk who was in charge of the conveyancing department of the solicitor\u2019s business. It was held that the solicitor was responsible for frauds involving forgery and theft committed by the servant by professing as clerk of the firm to transact business for a client. It is, of course, the essence of a solicitor\u2019s duty to his clients not only to act honestly but to act diligently in protecting the interests of his clients in the business committed to him, and loyally and faithfully in the fulfilment of any trust reposed in him. It was of the essence of the nature of the clerk\u2019s employment, who was the manager of the conveyancing branch of Mr. Smith\u2019s business and who was left by Mr. Smith in charge of that branch of the business, to observe these duties towards the clients of the firm, and this, of course, he well knew.\nInstead of acting honestly and faithfully in the protection of the client\u2019s interest, he formed a design to steal the client\u2019s money and by a series of acts purporting to be in his capacity of representative of the firm as the client\u2019s solicitors he successfully executed that design.\nIn these circumstances it was held by the learned trial judge, and his findings were affirmed by the House of Lords, that the clerk was, in the pertinent sense of the words, acting within the scope of his employment and in the course of his agency. In point of fact the acts by which he wronged the client, although purporting to be in the course of his agency, were, as appears from what has been said, inconsistent and indeed incompatible with the essential nature of his employment; and, of course, as between himself and his principal a \u201cbreach of authority,\u201d in the phrase of Willes J.\nLloyd v. Grace, Smith & Co.[11] was applied by the Court of Appeal to a case in which the managing clerk dealt with persons who were not clients of the firm, with the same result. The case was held to be \u201cprecisely covered\u201d by the earlier decision. (Uxbridge Permanent Benefit Building Society v. Pickard[12]).\nIf the servant commits the wrongful act, in respect of which the master is charged, within the scope and in the course of his agency (in the sense in which these words are used and understood in the law), then it is immaterial that he is acting, in fact, against his master\u2019s interests and for his own convenience and benefit. This is the proposition settled by the decision of the House of Lords in Lloyd v. Grace, Smith & Co.11\nIt is quite true that the servant while engaged in executing the duties of his employment may at the same time perform an act which has no relation to his employment, or to his master\u2019s business; an act of such a character that in doing it he divests \u201chimself of his character as servant,\u201d to employ the words of Blackburn J. in Ward v. General Omnibus Co.[13], or in those of Collins M.R., which are to the same effect, in Cheshire v. Bailey[14], \u201cin committing it he severed his connection with his master and became a stranger\u201d; such acts, not purporting to be acts in furtherance of his employment) are not contemplated by the principle of responsibility now under consideration.\nOf course, such phrases as those just quoted must be applied not as if embodied in a text of law but rather as indicating points of view from which the facts may usefully be considered. As Lord Macnaghten observed in Lloyd v. Grace, Smith & Co.[15], what is meant by such expressions as \u201cacting in the course of his employment,\u201d \u201cacting within the scope of his agency,\u201d is not easy to define with exactitude; and Sir Montagu Smith, speaking for the Privy Council in Mackay v. The Commercial Bank of New Brunswick[16], in a passage quoted by Lord Macnaghten in Lloyd v. Grace, Smith & Co.[17], said \u201cit is not easy to define with precision the extent to which this liability has been carried.\u201d As Lord Macnaghten observes in the same judgment, whichever of the various expressions may be most suitable to the particular case it must be construed liberally; but as a rule where the servant purports to be acting in the course of his service it is immaterial that, to repeat Story\u2019s words, \u201cthe principal did not authorize or justify or participate in, or indeed know of such misconduct, or even if he forbade the acts, or disapproved of them.\u201d I agree with Mr. Winfield who, in his book on Torts at p. 130, says that the question whether or not the servant\u2019s conduct is in the course of his employment raises an issue of fact for the jury, subject to a proper direction by the judge as to general principles. He cites a number of cases (Whatman v. Pearson[18]; Mitchell v. Crassweller[19]; Lloyd v. Grace, Smith & Co.[20]; Baker v. Snell[21]). These instances might be supplemented by scores of others.\nTurning now to the facts. It is admitted that the servant was, at the time he committed the negligent act, engaged in his master\u2019s business. He was in the execution of his duty taking a key he had made to fit in the lock for which it was intended. I think it is useful to consider the facts from the point of view suggested by the phrases quoted above from Blackburn J. and Collins M.R.\nThis is one of those cases\u2014it should be noticed\u2014in which the facts pertinent to the issue of responsibility are peculiarly within the knowledge of the respondents and their servants. The circumstance that such is commonly the case where responsibility is in issue is adverted to by Willes J. and Byles J. in Limpus v. London General Omnibus Co.[22] as one reason why \u201csecret\u201d instructions should be disregarded. \u201cThe law is not so futile,\u201d says Willes J., \u201cas to allow a master, by giving secret instructions to his servant, to discharge himself from liability.\u201d \u201cSecret\u201d instructions here seem to be instructions which in the ordinary course would be known only to the master and his employees. Byles J. says:\nAnd that this direction is right seems to me to be proved from another consideration. If we were to hold that this direction was wrong, a change, of course, at Nisi Prius would follow, and the consequence would be that in almost every case a driver would come forward and exaggerate his own negligence or misconduct, he not being worth one farthing, and say, \u201cI did it wilfully and unnecessarily,\u201d and so the master would be absolved.\nThe onus in respect of this issue is, of course, on the plaintiff, but in such circumstances very little evidence may suffice for a prima facie case and to shift the burden of proof in the sense of going on with the evidence. The only witnesses possessing any knowledge on the point were two servants of the Company. They were Stinson, whose act of negligence was in question, and the foreman McLeod, to whose orders Stinson was subject. McLeod, who describes himself as a bridge and building foreman, was called for the plaintiffs. It was upon the evidence of these two witnesses that the plaintiffs were compelled to rely.\nMcLeod identified two notices, the terms of which are important and I give them in full.\nCANADIAN PACIFIC RAILWAY COMPANY\nBruce Division\nTORONTO, December 28, 1937.\nALL CONCERNED:\nThe use by employees of their own cars in connection with the Company\u2019s business has been forcibly brought to our attention by possible heavy claims against the Company in recent accidents, and, after a check-up of the situation it develops that a large number of such employees do not carry public liability or property damage insurance. As a continuance of this practice is likely to seriously involve the Company, privately owned automobiles are not to be used in connection with the Company\u2019s business unless the owner carries insurance against public liability and property damage risks.\nPlease be governed accordingly.\nS.W. CRABBE,\nSuperintendent.\nCANADIAN PACIFIC RAILWAY COMPANY\nBruce Division\nTORONTO, March 21st, 1938.\nALL CONCERNED:\nReferring to my circular letter of December 28th, 1937, regarding the use of privately owned automobiles not covered by insurance in the execution of Company\u2019s business.\nSince then, several instances have come to notice where employees had used unprotected automobiles contrary to the instructions. In one case, a telegraph messenger undertook to use an automobile while his bicycle was undergoing repairs, and had the misfortune to strike and injure a prominent citizen. As a result, a heavy claim has been preferred against the Company on the grounds that the messenger was transacting Company\u2019s business at the time.\nIt is a serious matter to involve the Company in expenditures of this nature, and all concerned must clearly understand that automobiles not adequately protected by insurance must not be used in the execution of Company\u2019s business.\nWill you kindly take whatever steps are necessary to see that the instructions in this regard are being adhered to.\nS.W. CRABBE,\nSuperintendent. These notices indicate that before the date of the first of them employees in the Bruce Division had been using their own cars (uninsured) when engaged in the business of the Company; and the circumstance should be emphasized that these notices do not require the discontinuance of this practice. The order is that such cars shall not be used in the Company\u2019s business unless properly insured. The second notice shews clearly enough that the first had been disregarded to such an extent as to make necessary a second. As to the results of the second, one has only the evidence of the two witnesses mentioned, and they naturally speak only as to facts within their own limited observation; and I think there was sufficient evidence to cast upon the Company the burden of explanation. McLeod, a bridge and building foreman for a territory not defined, having his headquarters at West Toronto and a number (not stated) of men under his orders, received these orders for communication to these men. He says he read them to the men and posted them up and (a fact not to be overlooked) explained them. Both McLeod and Stinson say they understood the effect of them to be that an employee was permitted to use his car if it was insured.\nMcLeod says explicitly he took no steps to see that the rule was observed, beyond reading the orders and explaining them to the men; and the effect of McLeod\u2019s evidence seems to be that he did not until after the date of the accident know that Stinson\u2019s car was not insured; and Stinson says explicitly that no inquiry was addressed to him to ascertain whether his car was insured.\nThe respondents adduced no evidence to show that a breach of the rule was in any way penalized, even in the case of repeated breaches of it, by dismissal or by deduction from the offending employee\u2019s wages in respect of the time spent in driving his car, or that any other disciplinary measure was taken.\nMcLeod says there were available to Stinson several permissible ways to get to the North Toronto Station. Two of these were by use of vehicles to be run on the railway, another was by the use of street-cars. There is no evidence that Stinson had ever used any of these methods of travelling from one part of Toronto to another on the Company\u2019s business. Stinson, when asked whether he had used his automobile before the occasion in question on the Company\u2019s business, answered \u201conce or twice.\u201d McLeod says that this had occurred \u201conce and probably twice\u201d before the occasion that gave rise to the litigation.\nOn the facts mentioned, in the absence of explanation, it was open to a jury to find that no steps were taken to ascertain whether or not the rule was being observed; in other words, that it was left to each employee himself to observe the rule as one of the duties of his employment and that in driving his car (though uninsured) he was regarded by the Company, in the words of the notice, as still using it (though improperly) \u201cin the execution of the Company\u2019s business\u201d; and that Stinson had no idea that he was severing his relationship with the Company in doing so.\nThere was evidence, therefore, upon which the jury might have found, in respect of this issue, a verdict in favour of the appellant; but I do not think it necessary to consider whether the appellant would be entitled to a new trial, or whether the Court in the exercise of its discretion ought to direct a new trial, in view of the course of proceedings at the trial, in the Court of Appeal, and before us.\nThe learned Chief Justice of the High Court of Justice, before whom the case was tried, took the view that there was no issue of fact for the jury and held that the question of responsibility was a question of law only and that the legal result, on the uncontradicted evidence as he interpreted it, was that the driver Stinson was not acting within the scope or in the course of his employment in driving his car. Their Lordships, the Judges of the Court of Appeal, seem to have treated the question as a mixed question of law and fact and the appeal was argued before us on that footing.\nWe cannot, I think, treat the conclusion of the trial judge and the Court of Appeal as relieving us from the responsibility of considering the effect of the evidence. The learned trial judge treated the question as one of law, as I have already observed; I think he did not reserve it to himself in the exercise of a discretion, but decided it as a point of law; the learned Judges of the Court of Appeal were largely influenced by their view of the effect of the decisions cited in their judgments, some of which will be discussed later. I repeat that in my judgment there was, on the facts outlined above, evidence constituting a prima facie case for the appellant. My view of the result of the evidence is that Stinson, in using his automobile in the Company\u2019s service on the occasion in question, had no idea that he was not acting in the Company\u2019s service, and, moreover, when the terms of the notices are considered in light of the circumstances already mentioned, I think that such was not the Company\u2019s view of the effect of the use by an employee of his automobile in disobedience of the order.\nSome stress was laid upon an interview which is said to have taken place between Stinson and McLeod which, I shall assume, took place before the accident. As regards that incident, I think the effect of the evidence is that McLeod did not know that Stinson\u2019s automobile was uninsured and that in substance the incident amounted to little, if any more, than the fact that McLeod called Stinson\u2019s attention to the order. I have finished with the topic, discussed above, touching the sufficiency of the evidence to support a verdict on this issue in favour of the appellant, and I merely observe, in passing, that the appraisal of the testimony of McLeod and Stinson as to this incident was peculiarly matter for the jury. In any view of it, it adds nothing to the formal notices.\nThe evidence afforded by the formal notices of the use by employees of their cars uninsured in the Company\u2019s business, the explicit statement by McLeod that he took no steps to see that the directions were carried out beyond reading the notices to the men and explaining them to them, the explicit statement by Stinson that nobody on behalf of the Company did \u201ccheck up\u201d on him \u201cto see\u201d whether his car was insured, taken together with Stinson\u2019s conduct in disregarding the notices and the absence of any evidence that Stinson ever used any of the alternative methods of conveyance which are said to have been available to him, and the absence of any definite evidence as to the extent of the actual use of these alternative methods of conveyance and the absence of any evidence by any officer of the Company but McLeod as to steps taken to see that the order was observed, all point to the conclusion that the Company\u2019s officers were indifferent to the observance of the order. Having regard to the circumstances, I think it is a reasonable view of Stinson\u2019s conduct that in using his automobile for the purpose of transporting himself to North Toronto on the Company\u2019s business he was not doing an act which was, in the pertinent sense, wholly outside his employment.\nThe respondents indeed did not make any attempt to shew that the order was generally observed; which is not surprising, in view of Stinson\u2019s statement that no inquiry was addressed to him as to insurance. The defence of the respondents was really rested upon the order; and it was upon this point\u2014the intentional disregard of the order by Stinson\u2019s use of his automobile uninsured\u2014that the judgments at the trial and in the Court of Appeal proceeded.\nI have already mentioned the judgment of Knox C.J. in Whitfield v. Turner[23] in which it was held that where a servant has authority to do a given act in a state of circumstances or on conditions defined by his instructions, then, as between the master and a third person, it is, generally speaking, not material that the emergency defined in the instructions to the servant has not in fact arisen. In Goh Choon Seng v. Lee Kim Soo[24], it is said:\u2014\nThe principle is well laid down in some of the cases cited by the Chief Justice, which decide that \u201cwhen a, servant does an act which he is authorized by his employment to do under certain circumstances and under certain conditions, and he does them under circumstances or in a manner which are unauthorized and improper, in such cases the employer is liable for the wrongful act.\u201d\nand further,\nUnder head (3) come cases like the present, where the servant is doing some work which he is appointed to do, but does it in a way which his master has not authorized and would not have authorized, had he known of it. In these cases the master is, nevertheless, responsible.\nGoh Choon Seng v. Lee Kim Soo[25], Whitfield v. Turner23, as well as Bugge v. Brown[26], mentioned in the judgments in the Court of Appeal, were fire cases. Bugge v. Brown26 was cited as an illustrative case in the judgment of this Court in Port Coquitlam v. Wilson[27], which was also a fire case. Decisions in fire cases ought to be applied cautiously. If there is authority from the proprietor of land in prescribed conditions to set fires, the proprietor may be responsible where the fire has escaped and caused damage through want of proper precautions, quite independently of respondeat superior. In Black v. Christchurch Finance Co.[28], the proprietor was held liable for the escape of a fire due to the negligence of an independent contractor. There are some observations by Higgins J. upon this topic in Bugge v. Brown[29]. Goh Choon Seng v. Lee Kim Soo[30], although a fire case in one sense, was not concerned with the responsibility of a proprietor for a fire kindled upon his own land. The fire in that case was kindled by the employees of the appellant on the land of the Crown and the application of the principle of respondeat superior consequently arose.\nThe principle enunciated in the last paragraph quoted from Lord Phillimore\u2019s judgment is applicable here.\nIn the circumstances of this case the disregard of the order was immaterial because the servant\u2019s disobedience was an act in violation of one of the duties of his employment. As Willes J. said in Limpus v. The London General Omnibus Co.[31]:\u2014\nI beg to say, in my opinion, those instructions were perfectly immaterial. If they were disregarded, the law casts upon the master the liability for the acts of his servants in the course of his employment.\nStinson\u2019s disregard of the order in using his automobile to transport himself to North Toronto (which it was his duty by some means to do) was an act in the course of his employment in the sense of this observation.\nIt has been suggested that Lord Macnaghten\u2019s judgment in Lloyd v. Grace, Smith & Co.[32] has undermined the authority of Limpus v. The London General Omnibus Co.[33] But a careful reading of the judgment of Willes J. in the Law Journal report leaves the conviction that the first part of that judgment is not based upon the assumption that the servant might have been seeking to promote his master\u2019s interest. \u201cIt was,\u201d says Willes J., \u201ca case of improper driving,\u201d and the liability is put on the ground set forth in the two sentences just quoted, a ground upon which, I think, the appellant\u2019s claim can be supported here. It was left to him to see that his automobile was insured. Neglect in this was neglect in the duties of his employment, for which the master is responsible. I repeat, neither he nor the respondents considered that he was thereby divesting himself of his character of servant, nor was he, in my view, doing so in fact.\nIt was argued that Stinson, by his improper use of his automobile, put himself beyond the control of his master and that, therefore, on general principles, the situation was not such as to attract responsibility to the respondents for his negligent act.\nIn Williams v. Jones[34], Blackburn J. (as he then was) says:\u2014\nIn such a case it may seem hard that the master should be responsible, yet he no doubt is if he be his master within the definition stated by Parke B. in Quarman v. Barnett[35], that the person is liable \u201cwho stood in the relation of master to the wrongdoer\u2014he who had selected him as his servant, from the knowledge of or belief in his skill and care, and who could remove him for misconduct, and whose orders he was bound to receive and obey.\u201d\nIt is not the master\u2019s physical control over the conduct of his servant that gives rise to liability; it is the circumstance that he has selected the servant, who is bound to receive and obey his orders. For disobedience either in misconduct or in \u201cbreach of authority,\u201d to use the words of Willes J. in Bayley\u2019s case[36], already quoted, and for \u201cexceeding his authority in matters incidental\u201d to his employment, in the words of Collins M.R.[37], also quoted above, the master, as between himself and the servant, has his remedy by dismissal or otherwise, while third persons wrongfully injured by the servant\u2019s act have their remedy against both master and servant.\nI should like to say, with respect, that I entirely agree with Mr. Justice Masten in the caution he utters as to the cases decided under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Acts. Under these Acts the question is always a question between the employee, or his representatives, and the master, and an order, the disregard of which in such a case might be an answer to any claim by the servant and might give the master a remedy against the servant by way of dismissal, or penalty, or by an action for damages, may, nevertheless, be immaterial in a question between a third person and the master; and I think it ought to be noticed that the observation of Lord Dunedin in Plumb\u2019s case[38] was not directed to any question of responsibility to third persons. An order that might properly be held to define \u201cthe course of employment\u201d for the purposes of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Acts or generally as between the master and the servant, may, as between the master and the third person, merely impose upon the servant a duty, for default in the discharge of which the master is responsible to such persons.\nThree cases were relied on, upon which some comment, I think, is advisable. I shall refer first to Williams v. Jones[39]. The plaintiff was the owner of a building which the defendant had the liberty of using with his servants as a carpentry shop. One of the defendant\u2019s servants, while engaged in his duties as a carpenter and in the course of his master\u2019s business, in lighting his pipe carelessly set fire to some shavings and the shop was burned. The Court of Exchequer Chamber by a majority of three to two, Blackburn J. and Mellor J. constituting the minority, held that on the admitted facts the defendant was not responsible for the negligence of his servant, because the negligent conduct was not in a matter which had anything to do with his employment. It is sought to apply that decision to the present case by the contention that Stinson was not employed to drive a motorcar, and that in view of the order and the fact that Stinson\u2019s car was uninsured his act in driving his car must be held to be something wholly unconnected with his employment.\nThe analogy between Williams v. Jones39 and the present case entirely fails in my view. The act of the offending carpenter in that case in negligently handling the light he was using was something which, in the view of the majority, was wholly unconnected with the performance of his service, or with any duty connected therewith or incidental thereto. Here Stinson was not only engaged in his master\u2019s service at the time he was driving his motorcar, he was performing a duty of the service in getting himself conveyed to the place where it was his duty to go. He was on his master\u2019s business in conveying himself there by his car, unless the respondent\u2019s contention is sound that by reason of the order and of the absence of insurance his act in driving his car on the Company\u2019s business was of such a character, as already observed, as to sever the relationship of service. That I have dealt with.\nAnother case relied on is Rand v. Craig[40]. The defendant was a carman and contractor and he was sued upon a charge of trespass committed by his servant who had removed certain refuse from the premises of a third party and deposited it upon the plaintiff\u2019s vacant land. The defendant employed certain men to act as carters. They were employed by the day and were paid at the end of the day for the day\u2019s work. They went in the morning with their carts to specified premises to load rubbish, which they took to some other premises that were defined and described, particulars of which were given to the carmen, and in respect of each load a ticket was given them which had cost the defendant 6d. They were to go with their load of rubbish and the ticket to the premises of the person who issued the ticket, and by virtue of the ticket they had a right to shoot their load of rubbish on the premises owned or occupied by that person. The learned trial judge held that the carters who tipped the rubbish on the plaintiff\u2019s land were not acting within the scope of their employment. Only a stray carter here and there, the learned trial judge found, did this unauthorized tipping.\nThe trial judge and the Court of Appeal treated the question as a question of fact and it was held the finding of the learned trial judge that the acts of the trespassing carters were not acts within the scope of their employment ought not to be disturbed.\nHere again the analogy fails. The employment, both ostensible and actual, was evidenced by the ticket placed in the carter\u2019s hands, as well as by the conduct pursued by the general body of carters who, as the learned trial judge found, with an odd exception here and there, followed their instructions. His employment so evidenced was not to get rid of rubbish generally. It was to take it to the designated place where it could rightfully be left. In dumping the rubbish on the plaintiff\u2019s premises the carter was not acting in pursuit of the course of employment indicated by his ticket and followed by the other carters engaged in the same business. On the contrary, his act constituted an abandonment of his service as that service was known and practised by those engaged in it. Again in Rand v. Craig[41] there was a finding by the proper tribunal of fact that in point of fact the servant was not, in committing the trespass, acting in the course of his employment.\nThe third case which was greatly relied upon by the respondents at the trial is Goodman v. Kennell[42]. The facts appear in the report in 1 Moore and Payne, at p. 241. The plaintiff had been knocked down and run over by a horse ridden by one Cocking and he sued the defendant, alleging him to be liable for Cocking\u2019s negligence.\nCocking was not a regular servant of the defendant, but was occasionally employed by him and others in the neighbourhood. On the day mentioned in the declaration the defendant had sent Cocking to take a book from his house at Vauxhall to Furnival\u2019s Inn, for which he had given him a shilling. Cocking had taken the horse from a stable occupied jointly by the defendant and the owner of the horse, which he was in the habit of exercising and occasionally attending to. On the day in question Cocking had no order of either the defendant or the owner to take the horse. The owner stated in evidence that he had expressly ordered Cocking not to ride the horse to town. Cocking in evidence stated that he had taken the horse without the knowledge or consent of the defendant or of the owner.\nBest C.J. and Park J. agreed that there was, on the admitted facts, a prima facie case of implied assent by the defendant and that it was for the jury to judge of the value of the evidence of Cocking and the owner of the horse denying assent.\nBest C.J. said:\nIt was proved, that Cocking was the servant of the defendant; that the horse was in his stable; and that, on the day the accident happened, Cocking was going on the defendant\u2019s business or employment. The proof of these three facts was sufficient to raise a strong presumption, that Cocking was using the horse with the defendant\u2019s consent; * * * and left the plaintiff a prima facie case, and unanswered. Burrough and Gaselee JJ. agreed that the \u201ccase was properly left to the jury.\u201d\nThe servant in this case was employed as a messenger to take a book from one place to another. Two features of the case should be noticed.\nFirst: The servant was employed to do a single act of service and was in no sense the general servant of the defendant. There could be no question of a practice, and the learned Judges of the Common Pleas, obviously taking the view that this service for the consideration of one shilling did not in itself imply the use of a horse, thought, therefore, that the plaintiff was obliged to prove assent by the defendant to the use of a horse, or to adduce facts from which the jury might infer such assent.\nSecond: Such assent having been inferred by the jury, notwithstanding the express denial of the servant, that was sufficient to support a finding that the servant\u2019s reckless riding was conduct in the defendant\u2019s service, for which the defendant was responsible.\nThe servant was employed as a messenger, but, given assent to the use of the horse, the servant\u2019s dangerous riding, being conduct in a matter incidental to his employment, was that of the master. This seems to answer the contention advanced by the respondents that even if Stinson\u2019s car had been insured his negligent driving would not be negligence in the service of the respondents. The case admirably illustrates the function of a jury in such cases as this.\nAnother question arises. It is argued that in this view the respondent, the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, is jointly liable with Stinson and, judgment having been entered against Stinson, the appellant\u2019s cause of action against the Railway Company has disappeared, because transit in rem judicatam.\nI am unable to agree that the doctrine of Brimsmead v. Harrison[43] contemplates such a case as this. I think the rights of the parties in the present situation must be the same as they would have been if judgment had been given by the learned Chief Justice at the conclusion of the trial and judgment had been entered in favour of the plaintiffs against Stinson and in favour of the Railway Company as against the plaintiffs. As Willes J. said in the Court of Common Pleas[44], the rule in that case is, in the broad sense, a rule of procedure, and I do not think this rule of procedure can operate in such a way as to nullify the plaintiff\u2019s right of appeal.\nIn the result the appeal should be allowed and the appellant should have judgment for the amount of the verdict against the Railway Company, with costs throughout.\nThe judgment of Rinfret and Kerwin JJ. was delivered by\nKERWIN J.\u2014While on Marlborough Avenue in the City of Toronto, Leonard Lockhart, a six\u2011year-old boy, was injured by a motor car owned and driven by R. Stinson. An action was brought against Stinson and the Canadian Pacific Railway Company by the boy, suing by his father, Joseph Lockhart, as next friend, for damages for injuries sustained by the infant, and by the father himself for the accompanying expenses. Stinson was a servant of the Company and it was his duty, as stated by the trial judge, \u201cto make repairs of many kinds to the Company\u2019s property, movable and immovable.\u201d His headquarters were at the Company\u2019s shops in West Toronto where the Company kept, for the use of its employees in connection with their work, a \u201cspeeder,\u201d a \u201ctrack motor\u201d and a \u201chandcar,\u201d all of which ran on the Company rails, and sometimes an employee was instructed, or permitted, to travel by street-car. It was also known to the Company that many employees owned automobiles which from time to time were used by its employees on its business. This is made quite clear by two notices which it issued under the signature of its Divisional Superintendent wherein reference is found to this practice and to the possibility of claims being made against the Company for damages occasioned by the use of these automobiles in the Company\u2019s business, and such use was prohibited \u201cunless the owner carries insurance against public liability and property damage.\u201d Stinson owned a car which was not insured but, according to his evidence and the evidence of the foreman, he had used it on the Company\u2019s business once or twice before the time in question. Stinson knew of the notices and on the prior occasion or occasions had been warned by the foreman not to use the car again unless the terms of the notices were complied with, i.e., that he should carry the coverage mentioned. No amount of insurance was prescribed either by notice or warning.\nStinson made, at the West Toronto shops, a key for use in a lock in the Company\u2019s premises North Toronto and he was authorized, or instructed, by the foreman to go to North Toronto to try the key in the lock. He was given no directions as to the means of transportation that he should use in going there. He was not told not to use a motor car; the foreman testified that he thought Stinson would use the \u201ctrack motor.\u201d Stinson used his automobile to take the key to the North Toronto station and it was while he was on his journey there that the accident happened. He was entitled to be paid by the Company as well for the time required in going from one place to another as for the time spent by him in making the key.\nThe trial took place before Chief Justice Rose and a jury. In answer to specific questions, the jury found that the boy\u2019s injuries were caused by Stinson\u2019s negligence, which they itemized as\nA. Stinson was not paying proper attention.\nB. By driving too close to north curb.\nC. We find that Stinson had ample room to 6ee anybody crossing from north side to south side behind parked truck.\nand they assessed the damages at $10,000 for the boy and $500 for the father. The Chief Justice on these findings directed judgment to be entered against Stinson for these amounts but reserved the question of the Company\u2019s liability. He considered that all the relevant circumstances upon that issue were undisputed and therefore left no question to the jury with reference to it. He decided against the plaintiffs and upon appeal the majority of the Court of Appeal agreed with him. No appeal was taken by Stinson from the judgment at the trial against him, and, the father\u2019s damages being less than the statutory amount and no leave to appeal having been granted, the dismissal of the father\u2019s claim against the Company by the trial judge, concurred in by the Court of Appeal, stands.\nThe infant, however, appeals to this Court against the dismissal of his claim against the Company, and I have come to the conclusion that his appeal should be allowed. We have not to consider the point that was decided in Bright v. Kerr[45], because Stinson was undoubtedly a servant of the Company. Neither is it a question whether he was acting within the scope of his authority, but was he acting in the course of his employment. This was pointed out by Anglin J., as he then was, in Curley v. Latreille[46]. That was a case which depended upon the application of article 1054 of the Quebec Civil Code, but Mr. Justice Anglin considered the existing position of the common law upon the problem that confronts us. At page 153 he says:\u2014\nSince the decision in Limpus v. The London General Omnibus Co.[47], as pointed out by Fletcher Moulton L.J. in Smith v. Martin and Kingston-upon-Hull Corporation[48]:\n\u201cThe real question is whether it was an act done in the course of the (servant\u2019s) employment and not whether it was within the scope of the authority given to her.\u201d\nThe question is not one of authority: Smith v. North Metropolitan Tramways Co.[49]\nNor is the difficulty that which arises in England under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act as to whether as between an employer and employee an accident arose out of and in the course of the employment. Dallas v. Home Oil Distributors Ltd.[50] Once a person is found to be a servant, the question whether the master is liable to a third person, for injuries caused the latter by the servant\u2019s negligence, depends upon whether under all the circumstances the servant was acting in the course of his employment, and liability attaches even though the servant may be doing an act prohibited by the master. Limpus v. London General Omnibus Co.47\nThe master may protect himself by limiting the scope of his servant\u2019s employment but not merely by prescribing conduct within the sphere of the employment. It has therefore been decided that a person employed as a conductor cannot impose liability upon a master by his negligence in driving a bus, Beard v. London General Omnibus Co.[51], but an employer is responsible for damage caused by the negligent act of his servant in carrying out work which he is employed to do, even if the act incidentally involves a trespass which the employer has not authorized. Goh Choon Seng v. Lee Kim Soo[52]. While I do not know that the division there made by Lord Phillimore, speaking for the Judicial Committee, is to be regarded as exhaustive, I would, if obliged, place the present case under head 3* and, with respect, not under head 2* as did Masten J.A. with the concurrence of Middleton J.A. Stinson was employed not merely to make a key but to go to North Toronto to fit it in a lock,\u2014one was as much part of his functions as the other. He was entitled to be paid for the time so spent. The use of automobiles was not prohibited,\u2014in fact it was impliedly, if not explicitly, approved. The only restriction upon that use was that he should carry \u201cinsurance against public liability and property damage\u201d and even then, as I have already pointed out, the amount of coverage was not prescribed. It is perhaps needless to add that Stinson had not placed himself outside the scope of his employment by going off on a frolic of his own, as happened in many well-known cases.\nThe learned trial judge relied to a considerable extent upon a statement of Park J. in Goodman v. Kennell[53], where the defendant occupied a house jointly with another, which latter kept a horse in a stable behind a house where the defendant had previously kept one but, according to the report, had not one at the relevant time. One day the defendant sent one Corkin, an occasional servant, with a book into Holborn and gave him a shilling for his trouble before he went. Corkin, who had been in the habit of exercising the horse, went to the stable and took it (without any orders from his master and without communicating either to him or to the owner of the horse what he was about to do) and rode it to Holborn and was on his way back when an accident occurred causing injury to the plaintiff. Upon Sergeant Wilde, for the plaintiff, arguing, on the question as to whether Corkin was in the course of his employment by the defendant, that the defendant was liable whether Corkin chose to go on horseback or on foot, Park J. made the statement relied on:\u2014 I cannot bring myself to go the length of supposing, that if a man sends his servant on an errand, without providing him with a horse, and he meets a friend who has one, who permits him to ride, and an injury happens in consequence, the master is responsible for that act. If it were so, every master might be ruined by acts done by his servant without his knowledge or authority.\nPark J. then left to the jury the contradictory evidence as to the ownership of the horse and the question as to any implied authority from the defendant to Corkin to use it, and the jury found a verdict for the plaintiff. Upon motion to set aside the verdict on the ground that there was no evidence to go to the jury as to the defendant\u2019s ownership of the horse, or his assent to his servant\u2019s using it, the Court refused a rule, expressing their concurrence with the summing up and that the whole of the case had been properly put to the jury.\nThis case is also reported in 1 M. & P. 241, where the judgments of the judges in the Common Pleas are noted. Mr. Justice Park stated:\u2014\nA master would not, certainly, be liable for an act done by his servant whilst riding the horse of another, without his knowledge, or against his consent.\nLord Chief Justice Best remarked:\u2014\nIt has been truly said, that a servant\u2019s riding the horse of another, without the assent or authority of his master, cannot render the latter answerable for his acts.\nHowever, each pointed out that the question was whether there was sufficient evidence to show that Corkin (Cocking as he is called in 1 M. & P.) was riding the horse with the defendant\u2019s assent and on his business. Considering the final result and the trend of modern authority, it is unnecessary to express any opinion upon the remarks attributed to Mr. Justice Park and Lord Chief Justice Best.\nThis case was referred to in Stretton v. City of Toronto[54], and it in turn in Boyd v. Smith[55]. These decisions may be taken as correct under the circumstances that there existed. While Chief Justice Rose considered these cases not \u201cfor the purpose of narrowing or enlarging the limits of the rule\u201d as to the master\u2019s responsibility but for their value as illustrations, I am, with respect, unable to agree that they are of such a character as to place the present case beyond the pale. The difficulty of deciding in any particular case was clearly envisaged by the Chief Justice, as he referred also to two other decisions that are generally compared, Williams v. Jones[56], and Jefferson v. Derbyshire Farmers Ltd.[57]. In Salmond\u2019s Law of Torts, 9th edition, page 105, it is stated that while in the earlier case the servant was negligent during his performance of his master\u2019s business, he was not negligent in his performance thereof and that \u201cthe distinction may be one which is sometimes difficult of application to the fact, but it seems to be real and logical.\u201d But in Pollock\u2019s Law of Torts, 14th edition, page 72, in referring in a foot\u2011note to the Williams case56, it is stated: \u201cDiss. Mellor and Blackburn JJ., who thought, perhaps rightly, that the course of employment included ordinary care not to set the shed on fire.\u201d And in The Governor and Company of Gentlemen Adventurers of England v. Vaillancourt[58], Duff J., as he then was, pointed out that \u201cBlackburn J.\u2019s difference with his colleagues \u2018was as to the proper inference as from the facts\u2019 and his is the view which in a similar case would probably now be accepted,\u201d quoting Jefferson v. Derbyshire[59].\nI agree with the statement in Salmond (9th edition), page 99, that the decision in Lloyd v. Grace, Smith & Co.[60], \u201cmust be interpreted in the light of the facts.\u201d Winfield in his text book on the Law of Torts, in discussing the decision, suggests (p. 135), that \u201cthe defendants were held liable because they had unwittingly put a rogue in their place and clothed him with their authority.\u201d He continues:\u2014\nBut other decisions show that where the master has neither been negligent in the selection or supervision of his servant, nor has expressly or impliedly held out his servant as having authority to do the act, he will not be responsible for the servant\u2019s crime.\nI mention the decision merely to show that it has not been overlooked, but I think it has no relevancy to the matter presently under discussion.\nIn an admirable judgment in Bugge v. Brown[61], Isaacs J., at page 118, states the limit of the rule in terms that I believe correctly set forth the modern view:\u2014\nwhen the servant so acts as to be in effect a stranger in relation to his employer with respect to the act he has committed, so that the act is in law the unauthorized act of a stranger, and this statement was quoted with approval by the present Chief Justice of this Court in Port Coquitlam v. Wilson[62]. This also appears to be the conclusion reached in the fourth and subsequent editions of Salmond oil Torts; see, for example, page 95 of the 9th edition:\u2014\n* * * if the unauthorized and wrongful act of the servant is not so connected with the authorized act as to be a mode of doing it, but is an independent act, the master is not responsible; for in such a case the servant is not acting in the course of his employment, but has gone outside of it. He can no longer be said to be doing, although in a wrong and unauthorized way, what he was authorized to do; he is doing what he was not authorized to do at all.\nAll the facts are before us as they were before the trial judge and the Court of Appeal, and in view of the course of the proceedings throughout, we are entitled to draw all proper inferences. One of these is that Stinson had not severed his relations with his employer, the railway company.\nIt is said in the Company\u2019s factum (and the point was elaborated in argument), that \u201cthe manner in which the defendant Stinson chose to exercise his right as a citizen to use a public highway was in no way subject to the respondent\u2019s control.\u201d Now, in the first place, Stinson was not exercising his right as a citizen but was performing his duty to his master in going to North Toronto. He was using a conveyance of a kind at least impliedly authorized and was acting within the scope of his employment. Counsel recognized that the test was not the Company\u2019s actual control but its right to control (see Dallas v. Home Oil Distributors Ltd.[63]), but argued that the respondent had no right to dictate the speed of the car or the distance from the curb at which Stinson should travel or otherwise to direct his movements on the highway. Stinson being about his master\u2019s business, the Company possessed the very rights that its counsel disputes and this contention fails.\nIt is contended that even should this result be reached, the Company is not liable because, as between it and the infant, the trial judge\u2019s charge to the jury was defective on the question of Stinson\u2019s negligence. As regards Stinson himself, the owner and driver of the automobile, section 48 (1) of the Ontario Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O., 1937, c. 288, clearly applied and the onus was upon Stinson to show that the accident did not arise through his negligence or improper conduct. The jury were so instructed. It had been previously held by the Ontario Court of Appeal in Ross v. Gray Coach Lines Ltd.[64], that in actions against the driver of an automobile, the jury should be asked whether the defendant had satisfied the onus and that it was not proper to ask the jury to describe the negligence. This principle was reaffirmed in Newell v. Acme Farmers\u2019 Dairy Ltd.[65] No doubt the learned Chief Justice was familiar with these decisions and, while counsel were unable to agree as to what transpired in the Chief Justice\u2019s chambers in connection with the drafting of the questions to be submitted to the jury, it is, I think, apparent that the point now raised was present to the Chief Justice\u2019s mind, because at one point in his charge, after referring to the onus section, he says:\u2014\nThat is the only importance of the statutory provision; it is not applicable where you think, after hearing all the evidence, that you know whose fault it was. If, after hearing all the evidence, you think that you know that the fault was the fault of the driver, then of course you do not need to invoke the statute. If, on the other hand, after hearing all the evidence, you think that you know that the fault was not the fault of the driver, then the statute has no application. But when you are left feeling that without the aid of the statute you cannot decide one way or the other, then the statute comes to your aid and tells you how you are to decide.\nLater he told the jury:\u2014\nAs in other cases of the sort, you are going to be asked not to render a general verdict, but to answer written questions, and the first question is: Were the injuries suffered by the plaintiff Leonard Lockhart caused by the negligence of the defendant Stinson? Well, as I have-said to you, the statute seems to require you to say Yes unless the evidence satisfies you that you can say No.\nThe second question: If so, in what did such negligence consist? Now, it is conceivable that you could answer the first question Yes without being able to answer the second question at all but it is unlikely. That is to say, if you were answering the first question Yes simply because of the statute, without having made up your minds that in fact Stinson did something that was wrong and that you knew what that was, then you could answer the first question Yes and be unable to answer the second, but it is quite unlikely. The probability is that if you answer the first question Yes it will be because you think you know what Stinson did that was wrong, and, if you do, then proceed to answer the second question, and answer it quite fully.\nMy own view is that, if a driver of a motor car on a highway is found by a jury not to have satisfied the onus, liability attaches to the driver\u2019s master, if the driving occurred in the course of the servant\u2019s employment. In the case at bar, however, even if that be not so, no objection was taken by counsel for the Company to the charge and it was too late to raise the point upon appeal.\nIt was also objected that, judgment having been taken out by the infant against Stinson, and proceedings having been taken by the father in his personal capacity to secure by way of attachment part of the damages awarded him against Stinson, the Company\u2019s liability was ended. In my opinion, the point is not well taken. Whether or not in the case of a tort by a servant in the course of his employment the liability of the master and servant be joint, it is not alternative and the decision in Morel v. Westmoreland[66] has no application. A similar question arose in Bright v. Kerr[67] where it was not necessary for me to deal with it. In the present case, it is necessary and, having given it some consideration, I approve the judgment of the Ontario Divisional Court in Sheppard Publishing Co. Ltd. v. Press Publishing Co. Ltd.[68] This was followed by Chief Justice Rowell in the Court of Appeal in Kerr v. Bright[69], and in that case, \u201cin the special circumstances,\u201d the Chief Justice of this Court agreed with Chief Justice Rowell.\nA question was raised as to the assessment of damages. The infant claimed $5,000 in the statement of claim; the jury awarded $10,000. It does not appear that the jury were told the amount of damages claimed, or that they had the record with them. Chief Justice Rose considered that he had a discretion to allow the amendment; McTague J.A. and Gillanders J.A. were of the same opinion, and in a previous case an amendment had been permitted and allowed by the Court of Appeal, White v. Proctor[70]. I agree that the Chief Justice had a discretion and that it has not been shown that it was improperly exercised.\nThe appeal should be allowed, the judgment at the trial set aside and in lieu thereof there should be judgment (1) for the appellant against the Company for $10,000 and his costs of the action, (2) reserving to the Company its right to apply to the Supreme Court of Ontario for judgment in the third party issue between the Company and Stinson. In order to overcome any difficulty as to interest, that judgment should be dated July 12th, 1939, the date of the judgment of Chief Justice Rose dismissing the action as against the Company. The appellant is entitled as against the Company to his costs of the appeal to the Court of Appeal and of the appeal to this Court.\nCROCKET J.\u2014The principal question in this appeal concerns the liability of the respondent railway for the serious injury of the infant plaintiff by the negligence of its servant Stinson, with whom it was jointly sued, while driving his uninsured automobile from the respondent\u2019s railway workshops at West Toronto to its station at North Toronto some four miles distant, for the purpose of fitting a key he had made for a doorlock in the North Toronto station building.\nThe accident happened on July 18th, 1938, and the action was tried before Rose, C.J.H.C., and a jury, which found that the injury claimed for was entirely caused by Stinson\u2019s negligence, and assessed the damages at $10,000. The learned Chief Justice directed the entry of judgment against Stinson for this amount with costs, and reserved the question of the respondent\u2019s liability. Subsequently he directed the dismissal of the action against the respondent on the ground that the driving of a privately owned and uninsured motor car was not an act falling within the class of acts which Stinson was authorized to perform, and therefore that his negligence in the handling of such a car, even at a time when he was engaged in his master\u2019s business, does not bring his master under liability. On an appeal by the plaintiffs the Court of Appeal affirmed this judgment, McTague, J.A., dissenting.\nThere is no dispute as to the facts upon which the majority in the Court of Appeal obviously proceeded in affirming the trial judgment, so that the question involved, as the learned trial judge himself distinctly held, is purely a question of law.\nStinson had been regularly employed in the respondent\u2019s bridge and building department at its West Toronto workshops as a general repair man for many years and as such was subject to the directions of the foreman of that department. His duties necessarily included his travelling to the respondent\u2019s buildings in the Toronto district in connection with any repair work which should be required and entrusted to him. On the day of the accident, which gave rise to the plaintiff\u2019s action, he had been instructed by the foreman at the West Toronto works to make a key for a doorlock at the North Toronto station, and, having made the key in the shop at West Toronto, told the foreman he would have to take it to the North Toronto station to try it in the doorlock. For this purpose Stinson used his private automobile, which at the time was uninsured, though nothing was said by the foreman that he might do so or as to whether he was to proceed there over the respondent\u2019s railway track by a gasolene track motor or handcar, which employees sometimes used to travel from the workshops to this and other buildings of the respondent along the railway line in the course of their employment, or by a street tramcar, for which it was the practice of the railway to provide tram tickets when that means of transportation was desired. The foreman swore he did not know that Stinson was going in his own car, and thought he was going by the track motor. He admitted that he knew of at least one previous occasion \u201cor probably two,\u201d when Stinson had used his own car on similar jobs, and told the court that when he learned this he told Stinson that he must not use his car on the company\u2019s business in the company\u2019s working hours, to which he added the qualification, \u201cunless it was insured.\u201d At this time he had received a circular letter from the district superintendent, dated December 28th, 1937, prohibiting the use of privately owned automobiles \u201cin connection with the Company\u2019s business unless the owner carries insurance against public liability and property damage risks.\u201d Later he received a second circular letter under date of March 21st, 1938, from the district superintendent, \u201creferring to (his) circular letter of December 28th, 1937, regarding the use of privately owned automobiles not covered by insurance in the execution of Company\u2019s business,\u201d advising him that several instances had since come to notice \u201cwhere employees had used unpro-protected automobiles contrary to the instructions,\u201d stating that \u201call concerned must clearly understand that automobiles not adequately protected by insurance must not be used in the execution of Company\u2019s business,\u201d and requesting him to take \u201cwhatever steps are necessary to see that the instructions in this regard are being adhered to.\u201d The foreman testified that he read these circular letters to Stinson and that they were posted up on the shop door at West Toronto.\nIt is not disputed that at the time of the accident Stinson was using his automobile for the purpose of performing a duty appertaining to his master\u2019s business, viz: going to the North Toronto station for the purpose of trying the key he had made in the doorlock there; nor is it disputed that in using his car for this purpose he was disregarding his master\u2019s instructions and thus exceeding the limits of his authority as his master\u2019s servant. We are, therefore, squarely faced with the problem whether the former or the latter fact determines the question of the respondent\u2019s liability for the injury. The learned trial judge in dismissing the action against the respondent plainly proceeded on the latter consideration, and in this, as stated, he was upheld by the Court of Appeal.\nWith great respect, I am of opinion that both courts were in error in this regard. While they both apparently fully appreciated that the true criterion of the liability of the master for injury or damage sustained by third persons through the negligence of his servant is the scope or sphere of the employment for which the servant is hired, their decisions are clearly based on the ground that the district superintendent\u2019s instructions regarding the use of uninsured cars \u201cin connection with\u201d or, as the second circular letter put it, \u201cin the execution of\u201d the company\u2019s business, placed Stinson beyond the scope of his employment at the time of the negligence claimed for, or, in other words, that this restriction of his authority as to the use of his own or any automobile in the performance of his work necessarily limited the scope of his employment. None of the cases, to which we have been referred, to my mind justify such a conclusion.\nIt is true, as was pointed out by Collins, L.J., in Whitehead v. Reader[71], in the English Court of Appeal, that in some cases it is necessary to get back to the orders emanating from the master to see what is the sphere of employment of the workman, and some of these cases were, no doubt, decided upon the workman\u2019s authority as determined from his master\u2019s instructions, but Whitehead v. Reader71 itself decided that the disobedience of the master\u2019s order did not of itself prevent the act of the workman from being an act done \u201cin the course of his employment,\u201d and was therefore not conclusive upon the question of the sphere or scope of the servant\u2019s employment or the master\u2019s responsibility. Collins, L.J., himself said:\nI agree * * * that it is not every breach of a master\u2019s orders that would have the effect of terminating the servant\u2019s employment so as to excuse the master from the consequences of the breach of his orders.\nA. L. Smith, M.R., put it in this way:\nDoes disobedience to this order cause the man not to have been injured in the course of his employment? I think not. It cannot be said that every disobedience of an order terminates a man\u2019s employment.\nRomer, L.J., used these words:\nAt the time of the accident the workman was employed on his master\u2019s business. He was not idling or doing something which was clearly beyond the scope of his employment.\nThe dictum of Collins, L.J., in this case was adopted by Lord Dunedin as President of the Scottish Court of Sessions in Conway v. Pumpherston Oil Co.[72], and affirmed again by him in delivering his judgment in the House of Lords in Plumb v. Cobden Flour Mills Co.[73], with the concurrence of Viscount Haldane, L.C., and Lords Kinnear and Atkinson. In the last mentioned case Lord Dunedin said:\nThere are prohibitions which limit the sphere of employment and prohibitions which only deal with conduct within the sphere of employment. A transgression of a prohibition of the latter class leaves the sphere of employment where it was, and consequently will not prevent recovery of compensation. A transgression of the former class carries with it the result that the man has gone outside the sphere.\nThese cases accord precisely with the principle enunciated in 1862 by Willes, Byles and Blackburn JJ., in the leading case of Limpus v. London General Omnibus Co.[74], and, in my opinion, show the irrelevancy of a servant\u2019s disobedience of his master\u2019s orders in the prosecution of his master\u2019s business unless the prohibitive orders are of such a character as to place him entirely beyond the scope of his employment.\nAs far back as 1869, Cockburn, C.J., in Storey v. Ashton[75], laid it down that the true rule [for determining the liability of the master for the negligence of his servant] is that the master is only responsible so long as the servant can be said to be doing the act, in the doing of which he is guilty of negligence, in the course of his employment as servant.\nThis is the fundamental principle, which has been consistently recognized by this Court in many cases. See Halparin v. Bulling[76]; Curley v. Latreille[77]; Battistoni v. Thomas[78]; Moreau v. Labette[79]; and Jarry v. Pelletier[80].\nIn Halparin v. Bulling[81], although the court held that the master there was not liable for the negligence of his chauffeur, Davies J. based his judgment on the fact that the chauffeur was using his master\u2019s automobile \u201con his own business and pleasure and not on any business of his master.\u201d Duff J., with whom Anglin J. concurred, expressly adopted the dictum of Cockburn, C.J., in Storey v. Ashton[82], already quoted, and held that the Court of Appeal of Manitoba was right in finding on the evidence in that case that the chauffeur was not \u201cengaged in the doing of anything appertaining to the course of his employment as the respondent\u2019s servant.\u201d The decisive question, he said, was \u201cWas the chauffeur about his master\u2019s business when he ran down the unfortunate victim of his carelessness or was he making use of the respondent\u2019s car in an independent excursion of his own?\u201d Brodeur J. said that the jurisprudence under the English common law is that the master is not liable for the negligence of his servant while the latter is engaged in some act \u201cbeyond the scope of his employment for his own purpose.\u201d\nIn the Latreille case[83] Anglin J. reviewed all the important English and French cases regarding the master\u2019s liability for the negligence of his servant, in the course of which he pointed out that the decisive question in such cases was, not whether the servant\u2019s act was within the authority given by the master, but whether it was within the course of his employment, quoting the dictum of Fletcher-Moulton, L.J., in Smith v. Martin and Kingston-upon-Hull Corporation[84], and citing Smith v. North Metropolitan Tramways Co.[85] In Battistoni v. Thomas[86], Lamont J., who delivered the judgment of the court, said:\nIn cases of this kind the law is well settled. A master is responsible for the consequences of his servant\u2019s negligent act only while the servant is on his master\u2019s business.\nHe quoted the dicta of Jervis, C.J., and Maule J., in Mitchell v. Crassweller[87], as well as the dictum of Lord Atkinson in St. Helen\u2019s Colliery v. Hewitson[88], to that effect, and approved the following statement of the law by Salmond on Torts, 7th ed., p. 115:\nOn the other hand, if the unauthorized and wrongful act of the servant is not so connected with the authorized act as to be a mode of doing it, but is an independent act, the master is not responsible; for in such a case the servant is not acting in the course of his employment, but has gone outside of it. He can no longer be said to be doing, although in a wrong and unauthorized way, what he was authorized to do; he is doing what he was not authorized to do at all.\nIn Moreau v. Labelle[89], Rinfret, J., speaking for the Court, quoted the passage already reproduced from Lord Dunedin\u2019s speech in delivering judgment in the House of Lords in Plumb v. Cobden Flour Mills Co.[90], as laying down the proper test for determining whether a master\u2019s instructions to his servant do or do not limit the sphere of his servant\u2019s employment.\nIn Jarry v. Pelletier[91], Cannon, J., also delivering the unanimous judgment of the court, repeated Lord Dunedin\u2019s dictum as laying down the true test.\nThe result of the cases in this Court, I think, is to make it clear that the recognized criterion of the liability of a master for the negligence of his servant is, not whether the servant\u2019s act was within the authority given by the master, but whether it was within the sphere or scope of his employment as servant.\nThere is another Canadian case, that of Read v. McGivney[92], which, though not cited before us, I think I should mention, inasmuch as it illustrates and actually applies the principle referred to in circumstances which seem to me to more closely resemble in their effect those of the present case than do those in the majority of the numerous cases to which we have been referred. In that case an action had been brought to recover damages for the destruction of a portion of the plaintiff\u2019s woodland lot by the spreading of a fire set by the defendant\u2019s servant to a pile of brush and refuse in connection with land clearing work on the defendant\u2019s land, contrary to the defendant\u2019s express instructions that he must not do so that day. The cases of Limpus v. London General Omnibus Co.[93]; Bayley v. Manchester, etc., Ry. Co.[94]; Dyer v. Munday[95]; Storey v. Ashton[96], and Mitchell v. Crassweller[97], all of which were relied upon in the present appeal, were among the cases cited in the argument before the New Brunswick court. Hannington J., in delivering the judgment of the court (Tuck, C.J., Hannington, Landry, Barker, McLeod and Gregory, JJ.) said:\nI need not refer to the cases cited; but the authorities are perfectly clear that such instructions will not save the employer from responsibility from the careless or illegal act of his servant within the scope of his employment. The principle is well illustrated by the case of Limpus v. London General Omnibus Co.93The principle that governs is this: If a person sends another to do his work, or to work for him, and in pursuance of the work the other, within the scope of his employment, does an act whereby an injury is caused to a third party, then the employer is liable.\nThe Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Goh Choon Seng v. Lee Kim Soo[98], distinctly recognized the principle that the fact of a servant doing an unauthorized act does not excuse the master from responsibility if the unauthorized act be committed in the performance of the master\u2019s business. That was an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal of The Straits Settlements (Singapore), affirming the judgment of the trial judge in an action brought to recover damages caused by the negligence of the defendant\u2019s servants in kindling fires for the purpose of burning branches, jungle trees and other rubbish. The evidence proved that the fires were kindled, not on the defendant\u2019s land, but on adjacent Crown land, from which the flames spread to the plaintiff\u2019s land and destroyed his pottery works, and the trial judge so found and directed a reference for the assessment of damages. Counsel for the appellant, founding on Storey v. Ashton[99], argued that the kindling of the fires beyond the appel- lant\u2019s boundary was an act done by his servants for their own convenience and benefit, and was therefore outside the scope of their employment. Lord Phillimore, in delivering the judgment of the Board, dismissing the appeal, said:\nThe principle is well laid down in some of the cases cited by the Chief Justice, which decide that \u201cwhen a servant does an act which he is authorized by his employment to do under certain circumstances and under certain conditions, and he does them under circumstances or in a manner which are unauthorized and improper, in such cases the employer is liable for the wrongful act.\u201d\nAs the learned Chief Justice says, the manager of the plantation was authorized by his employment to burn the weeds, and that he did it in a manner and at a place which were not authorized by his employer, makes no difference. Time and place are only circumstances or incidents.\nHis Lordship then pointed out that all the cases, which had been brought to the Board\u2019s notice in the course of the argument, fell under one or other of three heads: (1) the servant was using his master\u2019s time or his master\u2019s place or his master\u2019s horses, vehicles, machinery or tools for his own purposes; (2) cases where the servant is employed only to do a particular work or a particular class of work, and he does something out of the scope of his employment; (3) \u201ccases like the present, where the servant is doing some work which he is appointed to do, but does it in a way which his master has not authorized and would not have authorized had he known of it.\u201d In the first two classes of cases, he said, the master is not responsible, but under head (3) he is.\nIn their reasons for judgment in the Appeal Court, Masten, Fisher and Gillanders, JJ.A., all referred to the Goh Choon Seng case[100] and sought to distinguish it from the case at bar. Middleton, J.A., I should state, concurred with Masten, J.A., on this branch of the appeal, though his reasons indicate that he would have dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s appeal on the ground that garnishee proceedings taken by the plaintiff against Stinson after the entry of judgment against him and the recovery thereby of a portion of the damages precluded his right to proceed further against Stinson\u2019s co-defendant. Masten, J.A., simply said that that case seemed to be distinguishable in its facts and that he referred to it only for the purpose of quoting Lord Phillimore\u2019s dictum as to the classification of cases bearing on the responsibility of the master under the three heads above mentioned. He thought the present case fell under head 2, and not under head 3, \u201cbecause when Stinson entered on his journey on the day of the accident in his prohibited uninsured car, he stepped outside the limit which bounded the sphere of his employment.\u201d Fisher, J.A., thought the general law laid down in the Goh Choon Seng case[101] was not applicable because the injury here did not occur \u201cin the actual performance of his particular duties by doing his work in a manner the master had not authorized.\u201d \u201cIt is here,\u201d he said, \u201cthat the facts in the case at bar differ from the facts and the general law laid down in Goh Choon Seng v. Lee Kim Soo101.\u201d Gillanders, J.A., said that the servant in the Goh Choon Seng case101 was, in lighting fires, and burning rubbish, doing what he was authorized to do, and \u201cit was immaterial to the master\u2019s liability that it was done on Crown lands, adjacent to those of the defendant, and at an unauthorized time.\u201d\nWith the utmost deference, I am unable to follow these distinctions. It seems to me that the clear effect of the Privy Council\u2019s decision was that, while the defendant appellant\u2019s servants in that case were authorized to light fires and burn brush on their master\u2019s land in the course of their employment, they were not authorized to light fires and burn brush on the adjacent Crown land, and that the fact of their having made use of the Crown land for the purpose of and in connection with the work they were authorized to do for their master was immaterial to the master\u2019s liability for the reason that it did not place the servants\u2019 unauthorized and improper act beyond the scope of their employment. In other words, the Privy Council decision strikingly reaffirms the fundamental principle laid down in the Limpus case[102] that a master is responsible for his servant\u2019s negligence while engaged in his master\u2019s business, and that the fact that the negligent act of the servant was committed while he was doing something he was not authorized to do as such servant cannot avail to free the master from liability therefor.\nThe Goh Choon Seng case101 bears a striking resemblance to that of Read v. McGivney[103], from which it differs in its material features only in the fact that the fire which destroyed the plaintiff\u2019s property was kindled beyond the boundary of the defendant\u2019s land, and that there was no definite instruction not to set any fire that day in connection with the work the servant was doing. The reasons for the Privy Council decision make it clear that these circumstances would make no difference.\nThe question before the Court of Appeal and before this Court, however, is, as already pointed out, not whether Stinson, in making use of his uninsured car for the purpose of his master\u2019s business, contrary to the instructions of the respondent\u2019s district superintendent, was doing an unauthorized and improper act\u2014that, as I say, is undisputed and plainly implied by the learned trial judge\u2019s finding\u2014but whether the fact of his disobeying those instructions placed Stinson outside the scope of his employment altogether while making use of his car for the purpose mentioned. The very statement of the problem seems to me to embody a manifest contradiction and to furnish its own inevitable answer. For how can it possibly be said, if Stinson was engaged in his master\u2019s business while driving his motor car, as admittedly he was, that his act in doing so contrary to his master\u2019s instructions, was of such a nature as to completely dissociate him during that particular journey from his employment as his respondent master\u2019s servant? He was either engaged in the business of his master or he was not. That is the governing factor. This, of course, does not mean that it is not competent to a master at any time to limit the scope of the particular employment for which the servant was hired, as clearly appears from some of the cases above mentioned, but it does mean that, once it is determined that a servant is doing something for his master in the course of his employment as his master\u2019s servant, the master cannot escape responsibility for the consequences of the servant\u2019s negligence while so acting upon the ground that he has prohibited him from doing any particular act unless the prohibition is such as to sever the relation of master and servant during the critical time.\nIf the question were not concluded by the undisputed and indeed the admitted fact that Stinson was using his car in journeying to the North Toronto station in connection with and in furtherance of his master\u2019s business, I should have thought that the only possible inference from the district superintendent\u2019s circular letters, on which the judgment a quo is entirely based, was that he and all other employees in the Toronto district were thereby authorized to use their own or any other privately owned cars in connection with their master\u2019s business, provided that they were insured against public liability and property damage. It was thus in no sense a definite prohibition against the use of motor cars in connection with the respondent\u2019s business, but a purely conditional or contingent prohibition, apparently made for no other purpose that that of transferring from the master to the automobile insurance companies the obligation of paying for injuries resulting to third persons from the negligence of its servants while engaged in the prosecution of its business, and one which clearly recognized the right of the respondent\u2019s employees to use motor cars so insured for that purpose. I should have had no hesitation in holding that a prohibition of such a character could not, under the law as recognized by this court in accordance with the principles laid down by the House of Lords and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, have the effect of so curtailing the scope of Stinson\u2019s employment, in the capacity of a permanent general repairs man, as to transform his act in using his uninsured car solely for the purpose of his master\u2019s business on the occasion in question into an act undertaken wholly for his own personal gratification (1) the servant was using his master\u2019s time or his master\u2019s servant. As McTague, J.A., concisely put it in his dissenting judgment,\nit seems perfectly clear that in transporting the key from West Toronto to North Toronto Stinson was about his master\u2019s business. Did he, because of the mode of transportation which he used, divest himself of the character of servant and become a stranger to his employer? I do not think so. If in the course of his trip he had gone off on a venture of his own and injured someone, it might well be said that in doing that he had lost his character of servant.\nAs to Mr. Tilley\u2019s objection that the appellants had lost their right to proceed further against the respondent by the garnishee proceedings they had instituted against Stinson, I also agree with McTague, J.A. There is one other objection, viz.: that the statement of claim fixed the damages asked on behalf of the infant plaintiff at $5,000 and that no amendment was applied for till after the jury had returned its verdict, when the learned Chief Justice allowed an amendment to cover the amount awarded. It was contended that he had no right to order the amendment after the jury had announced its verdict. The learned Chief Justice overruled the objection and expressed the opinion that in view of the circumstances disclosed by the evidence, the assessment was not excessive. In the Appeal Court, Gillanders and McTague, JJ.A., were of the opinion that in the circumstances the jury\u2019s assessment of damages should not be disturbed. I am of the same opinion.\nFor these reasons, I would allow the appeal with costs here and in the Court of Appeal and direct that the judgment be entered against both defendants alike for the amount assessed by the jury, in favour of the infant plaintiff, viz.: $10,000; this amount to be paid into court to the latter\u2019s credit and to be paid out to him on attaining the age of twenty-one years and subject to further order meanwhile, as directed in the formal judgment of the trial court against Stinson, with a further order that both defendants pay to the plaintiff in his capacity as next friend of the infant plaintiff, his costs of action in that behalf.\nAppeal of the infant plaintiff allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: David J.

The King, [1941] S.C.R. 317\nDate: 1941-04-22\nCommissioner of Provincial Police (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nHis Majesty The King On the Prosecution of Pascal Dumont (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1941: February 6; 1941: April 22.\nPresent: Duff C.J. and Crocket, Davis, Kerwin and Hudson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nAutomobile\u2014Mandamus\u2014Judgment for costs only against person holding automobile licenses\u2014Power of Commissioner of Provincial Police to suspend licenses on failure to satisfy judgment\u2014Whether such judgment within meaning of section 84 (1) of Motor Vehicle Act\u2014Capacity in which Commissioner acts under said section\u2014Motor Vehicle Act, R.S.B.C, 1936, c. 195, s. 84.\nThe respondent Dumont brought action against one Bollons for damages resulting from an automobile accident, and Bollons counterclaimed for damages in the sum of $59.35. Both claim and counter-claim were dismissed with costs. No damages therefore were recovered by either party. After taxation, the respondent Dumont's costs of the counterclaim being set off against Bollon's costs of the action, the result was that the respondent Dumont became liable under the judgment to pay to Bollons the balance of the costs, i.e., $466.25. This sum not having been paid within 30 days and no appeal having been taken, the Commissioner of Provincial Police suspended the respondent Dumont's driver's and owner's licenses under section 84 of the Motor-Vehicle Act. The respondent Dumont then launched mandamus proceedings directed against the Commissioner to compel him to return the said licenses. The trial judge dismissed the application; but, on appeal to the Court of Appeal, that judgment was reversed and mandamus was granted. After the judgment of the appellate court, the Commissioner of Police complied with the order and delivered up the licenses and number plates to the respondent Dumont.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal (55 B.C.R. 298), that the facts of this case do not bring the appellant's action, suspending the respondent's licenses, within the authority of the Commissioners under the statute. The judgment against the respondent Dumont for costs in an action brought by himself in which no amount was recovered for damages, either in respect of personal injury or in respect of damage to property and in which no claim was made against Dumont for damages in excess of $100, does not bring the power of the Commissioner under section 84 into operation.\nHeld, also, that, the appeal on the question of the construction of the statute being entirely without merit and owing to the acquiescence of the Commissioner in the judgment of the appellate court, this appeal had no practical object; but it may be stated that there is no doubt that the Commissioner's authority is vested in him as the agent of the statute and that mandamus would lie to compel him to perform his statutory duty; but it is unnecessary for the court to decide whether in the circumstances of this case mandamus was the proper procedure.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], reversing the judgment of the trial judge, Morrison C.J.S.C., which judgment had discharged an order nisi for a mandamus to compel the Commissioner of Police to return a driver's and owner's licenses which were alleged to have been wrongly suspended in purported pursuance of section 84 of the Motor-Vehicle Act.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported. H. Castillou for the appellant.\nP. S. Marsden for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2014A brief sketch of the facts leading up to this litigation is necessary. The respondent Dumont is a retail dealer in Vancouver, using in connection with his business a delivery truck, for which he had a British Columbia license. He also held a driver's license. In November, 1937, a motor vehicle driven by Dumont was in collision with a motor vehicle driven by one Bollons. Dumont instituted, subsequently, as plaintiff, an action in the Supreme Court of British Columbia against Bollons as defendant, claiming damages for personal injuries and for injury to his motor vehicle. Bollons defended the action and entered a counterclaim against Dumont for the sum of $59.35 for damages to his automobile. At the trial Dumont's claim was dismissed with costs, which were subsequently taxed at $675.45, and Bollons' counterclaim was dismissed with costs, subsequently taxed at $209.40, Dumont's costs of the counterclaim being set off against Bollons' costs of the action, in the result Dumont became liable under the judgment to pay to Bollons the balance of costs. No damages were recovered by either party.\nOn the first of April, 1940, the judgment for costs not being paid, the Commissioner of Provincial Police, purporting to act under section 84 (1) of the Motor-Vehicle Act, suspended the truck license mentioned above and Dumont's driver's license, and on the 2nd of April, 1940, the licenses were delivered by Dumont to the Commissioner in response to his demand. On or about the 6th day of April, 1940, Dumont consulted his solicitor, who wrote a letter to the Commissioner setting out the facts and requesting the Commissioner to rescind the purported suspension of Dumont's licenses. By letter dated April 9th, 1940, and addressed to Mr. P. S. Marsden, Dumont's solicitor, the Commissioner refused this request. Thereupon, on the 16th day of April, 1940, Dumont, through his solicitor, commenced proceedings by notice of motion for a writ of mandamus, directed to the Commissioner of Provincial Police requiring him to return to Dumont the licenses and number plates.\nThe learned Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of British Columbia dismissed the application for mandamus and on appeal this judgment was reversed and mandamus was granted. The learned judges of the Court of Appeal unanimously held that the Commissioner had no authority under subsection (1) of section 84 of the Motor-Vehicles Act, R.S.B.C., 1936, chap. 135, under which he had purported to act, to suspend the respondent's licenses. I agree with this view. The suspension of a driver's license and the owner's licenses in respect of motor vehicles may be a very serious matter and, while the legislation under consideration was enacted no doubt for cogent reasons as affecting the public interest, it must be assumed that the language which the legislature employed to express its meaning does express it; and a public official, named in such a statute as the official to exercise the authority thereby conferred, is, in exercising that authority, within the \" iron framework\" of the enactment to which he is professing to give effect.\nAs I have said, I have no doubt that the facts of the present case do not bring the Commissioner's action within the authority of the Commissioner under the statute. It is quite plain that the judgment against Dumont for costs in an action brought by himself in which no amount was recovered for damages, either in respect of personal injury or in respect of damage to property and in which no claim was made against Dumont for damages in excess of one hundred dollars, does not bring the power of the Commissioner under section 84 (1) into operation. This is so clear that, in my opinion, there is no room for argument upon it.\nAfter the judgment of the Court of Appeal allowing the appeal, the Commissioner of Police very properly complied with the order and delivered up the licenses and number plates. The argument on behalf of the appellant in support of the Commissioner's authority being, as I have said, quite without substance, I think a reasonable interpretation of what occurred is that the Commissioner acquiesced in the judgment of the Court that the suspension was invalid and that he was not entitled to retain the licenses and number plates. From that point of view the appeal had no practical object. Even if the appellant's technical objection to the proceeding by way of mandamus had been well founded, the licenses and number plates would still remain in the hands of the respondent; the purported suspension would still remain a void act and the only question for discussion on the appeal would be the academic technical question with regard to the propriety of proceeding by mandamus and the question of costs.\nIf an application had been made to quash the appeal at the outset we should have been compelled to say that, the appeal on the question as to the effect of this statute being entirely without merit and the judgment on that point having been acquiesced in, the sub-stratum of the litigation had disappeared and the appellant could not be allowed to prosecute the appeal for the purpose of raising a technical question which had become entirely academic and the question of costs.\nI do not mean to throw any doubt upon the decision of the Court of Appeal touching the technical point of procedure and I have no doubt that the Commissioner's authority is vested in him as the agent of the statute and that mandamus will lie to compel him to perform his duty. It is unnecessary to decide whether in the circumstances of this case mandamus was the proper procedure, but it must be understood that on that point we are not dissenting from the view of the Court of Appeal.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: H. Castillou.\nSolicitor for the respondent: P. S. Marsden.\n[1] (1940) 55 B.C.R. 298; [1940] 3 W.W.R. 39; [1940] 4 D.L.R. 721.\n",

The statute does not profess to prohibit people going beyond the limits of the province for the purpose of getting the benefit of the services of a dentist, or to regulate their conduct in doing so; nor does it prohibit the sending into the province from abroad of newspapers and journals containing the advertising cards of practising dentists; nor does it prohibit any communication with the province from abroad.\nUnion Colliery Company of British Columbia v. Bryden, [1889] A.C. 580 dist.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal (55 B.C.R. 506) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], affirming the judgment of the trial judge, Murphy J.[2] and maintaining an action for an injunction to prevent publication of advertisements in the daily paper of the appellant, the News Publishing Company, Limited, at Nelson, B.C., on behalf of and by the authority of the appellant Cowen, who is not a member of the College of Dental Surgeons, holding him out as a dentist practising in the city of Spokane, in the State of Washington, U.S.A.\nJ. W. de B. Farris K.C. for the appellants.\nR. L. Maitland K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2014This appeal raises the question of the validity of an amendment to the British Columbia Dentistry Act, R.S.B.C., 1936, chap. 72, s. 63, which was enacted in 1939 by chap. 11, s. 3, of the statutes of that year. The section as amended reads as follows:\u2014 No person not registered under this Act shall, within the Province, directly or indirectly offer to practise, or hold himself out as being qualified to practise, the profession of dentistry either within the Province or elsewhere, and no person shall, within the Province, directly or indirectly, hold out or represent any other person not registered under this Act as practising or as qualified or entitled or willing to practise the profession of dentistry in the Province or elsewhere, or circulate or make public anything designed or tending to induce the public to engage or employ as a dentist any person not registered under this Act.\nPrior to the passing of this amendment the Dentistry Act had established certain prohibitions affecting persons not registered under the statute in respect of the practice of dentistry in British Columbia. In effect, it forbade such persons to offer to practise dentistry in British Columbia, and prohibited anybody from holding out any such person as entitled or qualified to practise dentistry in that province.\nThe result of the amendment is to bring under the ban of these prohibitions cases where the offer to practise or the holding out, relates to the practice of dentistry outside the province, and the capacity of a provincial legislature to pass such legislation is challenged by the appeal.\nThe decisive consideration, in my opinion, is that the prohibitions are directed against acts done within the province. Prima facie the legislation is within the provincial legislative sphere. Nor do I think (subject to an observation to be made upon one feature of the amending statute) there is any circumstance present here which has the effect of rebutting this prima facie conclusion. The statute does not profess to prohibit people going beyond the limits of British Columbia for the purpose of getting the benefit of the services of a dentist, or to regulate their conduct in doing so; nor does it prohibit the sending into British Columbia from abroad of newspapers and journals containing the advertising cards of practising dentists; nor does it prohibit any communication with British Columbia from abroad. Such prohibitions would present an entirely different question.\nThere is one feature of the statute to which it is desirable to advert. By section 63 of the principal Act, which is now section 63, subsection (1), there is a definition of \"practising the profession of dentistry within the meaning of this Act.\" By section 2 of the amending Act of 1939, section 63 is amended by bringing within the category of persons who are deemed to be practising dentistry within the meaning of the Act\nany person *** who supplies or offers to supply to the public artificial teeth, dentures or repairs therefor.\nIt would seem to be at least arguable that the statute as amended in 1939 prohibits the publication in British Columbia by persons carrying on business outside the Province of advertisements stating that they are manufacturers of or dealers in dental supplies of the description or descriptions mentioned. It is unnecessary to consider this aspect of the amendments of 1939. It might be argued, not without plausibility, that any prohibition of the publication in British Columbia of such advertisements in respect of articles of commerce is legislation in relation to a matter that is not a local British Columbia matter, within the contemplation of sections 91 and 92 of the British North America Act. Assuming the amending legislation to be pro tanto invalid by reason of this particular feature of it, the offending parts seem to be plainly severable; and no such question is raised by the advertisements before us.\nThe argument of Mr. Farris was largely based upon Bryden's case[3]. There it was held that the statute (having regard to its necessary effect) invaded the legislative field assigned exclusively to the Dominion by section 91(25) \"naturalization and aliens.\" Subject to what has just been said, the principle of the judgment in that case does not apply here.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Farris, Farris, McAlpine, Stultz, Bull & Farris,\nSolicitors for the respondent: Maitland, Maitland, Remnant & Hutcheson.\n[1] (1940) 55 B.C.R. 506; [1941] 1 W.W.R. ; [1941] 1 D.L.R. 565.\n[2] (1940) 55 B.C.R. 370; [1940] 3 W.W.R. 242; [1940] 4 D.L.R. 755.\n[3] [1899] A.C. 580.\n",

It had branch offices in the province of Saskatchewan. It manufactured agricultural implements, the manufacture being wholly outside of Saskatchewan. It sold its products in Saskatchewan and elsewhere. All moneys received in Saskatchewan, for sales or in payment of debts, were deposited in separate bank accounts and remitted in full to the head office in Hamilton. It kept no separate profit and loss account in respect of the business done in Saskatchewan; it kept at its head office in Hamilton a profit and loss account of its entire business.\nBy statute of Saskatchewan, every corporation and joint stock company \"residing or ordinarily resident or carrying on business within the province\" must pay a tax upon its income during the preceding year. \"Income\" was defined (in part) as \"the annual net profit or gain * * * as being profits * * * received by a person * * * from any trade, manufacture or business * * * whether derived from sources within Saskatchewan or elsewhere.\" Profits earned by a corporation or joint stock company (other than a personal corporation) \"in that part of its business carried on at a branch or agency outside of Saskatchewan\" were not liable to taxation. The income liable to taxation of every person (including any body corporate and politic) residing outside of Saskatchewan, who was carrying on business in Saskatchewan, \"shall be the net profit or gain arising from the business of such person in Saskatchewan\" (Income Tax Act, 1932, s. 21 a; Income Tax Act, 1936, s. 23). Where the Minister was unable to determine or to obtain the information required to ascertain the income within the province of any corporation or joint stock company or of any class of corporations or joint stock companies, the Lieutenant-Governor in Council might make regulations for determining such income within the province or might fix or determine the tax to be paid by a corporation or joint stock company liable to taxation. Regulations were issued \"covering such cases where the Minister is unable to determine or obtain information required to ascertain the income within the Province of a corporation or joint stock company carrying on a trade or business within and without the Province.\" A regulation (applied in the present case) provided that the income liable to taxation \"shall be taken to be such percentage of * * * the income as the sales within the Province bear to the total sales \"; the sales being measured by the gross amount received from sales and other sources (certain kinds of receipts being excluded). Provision was made for a taxpayer objecting as to the application of such method to his business and for re-determining the taxable income by some other method of allocation and apportionment as the Commissioner might decide.\nOn August 23, 1938, the Commissioner of Income Tax made assessments upon appellant in respect of its income for each of the years 1934, 1935, and 1936, applying the regulation above quoted. Appellant appealed unsuccessfully from the assessments, first to the Board of Revenue Commissioners and then to Anderson J. ([1939] 3 W.W.R. 129). It then appealed to the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan, which held ([1940] 2 W.W.R. 49) that, on consideration of the relevant statutes, there was no right of appeal to it in respect of the assessment for 1934, and the appeal as to that assessment should be dismissed for want of jurisdiction; but that there was a right of appeal in respect of the assessments for 1935 and 1936; and that the assessments for 1935 and 1936 were defective in that they did not provide for allowance for deduction in respect of a reserve for bad debts, and should be set aside, and in making new assessments the question of such reserve should be reconsidered in the light of the reasons for judgment of the Court of Appeal; but that all other objections to the assessments failed. On appeal and cross-appeal to this Court:\nHeld (per Rinfret, Crocket, Kerwin and Hudson JJ.): (1) There was a right of appeal to the Court of Appeal with respect to the assessments for 1935 and 1936, as held by the Court of Appeal; but there was also a right of appeal to the Court of Appeal with respect to the assessment for 1934. (Provisions of the following Saskatchewan Acts considered: The Income Tax Act, 1932, c. 9, and amending Act, 1934-35, c. 16; An Act to amend The Treasury Department Act, 1934-35,. c. 6; The Income Tax Act, 1936, c. 15; and amending Acts, 1937, c. 8; 1938, c. 91 (s. 2); 1939, c. 9; The Treasury Department Act, 1938, c. 8; and amending Acts, 1940, c. 5, c. 6). (2) The application of the above quoted regulation was validly adopted in the method of assessment. The regulation, and the authorizing statutory enactment, were intra vires. Their purpose was to reach by taxation only the income arising from the business in Saskatchewan, of non-resident companies which carry on business in Saskatchewan, and the purpose of their application in the present case was to reach by taxation only the income arising from appellant's business in Saskatchewan. And the adoption of such method was proper under the circumstances, as being the best available means to ascertain that income. (Bank of Toronto v. Lambe, 12 App. Cas. 575; Attorney-General v. Till, [1910] A.C. 50, at 72, cited).\n(3) The holding of the Court of Appeal that the assessments for 1935 and 1936 were defective as aforesaid and should be set aside, and the direction for reconsideration of the question of a reserve for bad debts, should be affirmed; but the same holding and direction should be applied in respect of the assessment for 1934.\nPer the Chief Justice and Davis and Taschereau JJ. (dissenting): The assessments were invalid because the regulation pursuant to which they purported to be made either did not apply to appellant or was beyond the powers of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council. The essence of appellant's profit making business is a series of operations as a whole (including manufacturing, etc.). Though that part of the proceeds of appellant's sales in Saskatchewan which is profit is received in Saskatchewan, yet it cannot be said that the whole of such profit \"arises from\" that part of its business which is carried on there within the contemplation of s. 21a (above quoted, of the Act of 1932\u2014the same as s. 23 of the Act of 1936). The effect of the words \"net profit or gain arising from the business of such person in Saskatchewan\" in s. 21a is, for the purpose of s. 21a, to delete from the definition of \"income\" above quoted the words \"or elsewhere.\" The policy of the Act, as shown by s. 21a, along with other provisions, is that the profits taxable under s. 21a as \"arising from the business\" of a non-resident \"in Saskatchewan\" are that part of the profits which is earned therein, and to remove from the incidence of income tax profits earned elsewhere, without regard to the place where those profits may have been received. (Commissioners of Taxation v. Kirk, [1900] A.C. 588, referred to as helpful in the elucidation of the Act now in question). In the present case the method of determination adopted, as put in the regulation, was to ascertain the ratio of the sales in Saskatchewan to the total sales and then apply that ratio to the income (profits). As determined by this method, the subject of taxation is a percentage of the sales in Saskatchewan, a percentage which is identical with the ratio between total profits and total sales. Under the regulation applied, the subject of income tax is that part of the sales in Saskatchewan which is profit; that is to say, the whole of the profit received in Saskatchewan. This is a procedure wholly inadmissible under the Act. Nowhere does the Act authorize the Province to tax a manufacturing company, situated as appellant is, in respect of the whole of the profits received by the company in Saskatchewan. It is not the profits received in Saskatchewan that are taxable; it is the profits arising from its business in Saskatchewan; not the profits arising from its manufacturing business in Ontario and from its operations in Saskatchewan taken together, but the profits arising from its operations in Saskatchewan. The enactment authorizing the making of regulations limits the authority to making regulations \"for determining such income within the province\"; \"such income\" being the income contemplated by the taxing provisions of the Act as the subject of income tax; i.e., in the case of non-resident companies, the profits arising out of that part of their business that is carried on in Saskatchewan. Consequently, the regulation in question, if it applied to non-resident companies such as appellant, was not competently made, because its aim was not within the purpose for which the statutory authority was given. The aim of the regulation was to determine the profits received by such companies in Saskatchewan; the authority was to make regulations for determining the net profits as limited and defined by s. 21a.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[1] in so far as it dismissed the present appellant's appeals from the judgment of Anderson J.[2] dismissing its appeals from the decision of the Board of Revenue Commissioners of Saskatchewan dismissing its appeals from three assessments, all bearing date August 23, 1938, for income tax in respect of the years 1934, 1935, and of the period of ten months ending October 31st, 1936, respectively.\nThe formal judgment of the Court of Appeal was in part as follows:\n* * * and this Court having held that there is no appeal from the decision of the said Judge in Chambers in respect of the said assessment for the taxation year 1934, but that the said assessments for the taxation years 1935 and 1936 should be set aside because they are defective in so far as a reserve for bad debts is concerned, and this Court having awarded the appellant two-thirds of its costs incurred in this Court and below, and having held that on all other grounds the said appeals fail;\n1. THIS COURT DOTH HEREBY ORDER AND ADJUDGE that there is no appeal from the decision of the said Judge in Chambers under the Income Tax Act of 1932, and that therefore the said appeal in respect of the said assessment for the taxation year 1934 be and the same is hereby dismissed on the ground that this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain the same.\n2. THIS COURT DOTH FURTHER ORDER AND ADJUDGE that the said assessments for the taxation years 1935 and 1936 respectively are defective in that they do not make provision for the appellant being allowed any deduction in respect of a reserve for bad debts, and that the said assessments for the said years 1935 and 1936 be and the same are hereby set aside.\n3. AND THIS COURT DOTH FURTHER ORDER that the Commissioner in making new assessments for the said years 1935 and 1936 shall reconsider the question of a reserve for bad debts in the light of the reasons for judgment of this Honourable Court delivered this day, and shall exercise the discretion vested in him by section 6 (d) of the Income Tax Act, 1936, upon sound principles.\n4. AND THIS COURT DOTH FURTHER ORDER AND ADJUDGE that the respondents do pay to the appellant two-thirds of the appellant's costs of and incidental to its said appeals to this Court and its said appeals to a Judge of the Court of King's Bench, such costs to be taxed on the King's Bench scale.\nSpecial leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was granted to the appellant by the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan. Appellant's notice of appeal (following in effect the provisions of the order granting special leave) limited its appeal to complaint against\nclause 1 of the formal judgment or order of the Court of Appeal and the judgment or decision of the said Court that on all other grounds, except with respect to the deduction in respect of a reserve for bad debts, as ordered in clauses 2 and 3 of the formal judgment or order of the Court of Appeal, the appellant's appeals fail, and including among the part complained of the disallowance by the said Court (in clause 4 of the formal judgment or order) of one-third of the appellant's costs of its appeals to this Court and to a Judge of the Court of King's Bench.\nThe respondents cross-appealed, contending that the Court of Appeal should have held that there was no appeal from the decision of the Board of Revenue Commissioners with respect to the assessments for the taxation years 1935 and 1936 respectively; or, if it be held that the Court of Appeal had jurisdiction to hear the appeals with respect to said assessments, then it erred in holding that the Commissioner of Income Tax, in making an allowance for bad debts, made a mistake in law in arriving at the amounts to be assessed; and that the Court of Appeal erred in its award as to costs; and asked for variations in the judgment of the Court of Appeal accordingly.\nThe material facts of the case, the statutes involved, and the questions in dispute are sufficiently stated in the reasons for judgment in this Court now reported.\nThe appeal to this Court was allowed in part. The assessment for the taxation year 1934 was set aside and the same directions were given to the Provincial Tax Commissioner in reconsidering the question of a reserve for bad debts as the directions contained in paragraph 3 of the order of the Court of Appeal with respect to the taxation years 1935 and 1936. Appellant was to have one-half of its costs of its appeal. The cross-appeal was dismissed with costs. The Chief Justice and Davis and Taschereau JJ. would allow the appeal and quash the assessments.\nFrank L. Bastedo K.C. for the appellant.\nSamuel Quigg K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Davis and Taschereau JJ. was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice\u2014The appellant company carries on the business of manufacturing and selling agricultural machinery and parts thereof. The Company is incorporated under the Companies Act of Ontario and is registered in Saskatchewan under the Companies Act of that province.\nIts head office is at Hamilton, Ontario. Its manufacturing business is carried on wholly outside Saskatchewan. The Company sells its products in Saskatchewan, as well as in other parts of Canada. It is admitted that the central management and control of the Company are at the head office in Hamilton.\nOn the 23rd of August, 1938, the Commissioner of Income Tax for Saskatchewan made assessments upon the Company in respect of its income for each of the years 1934 to 1936 inclusive. The subject of the tax, the taxable income of the Company for those years, was \"determined\" by the Commissioner in professed exercise of his authority under regulations approved by Order in Council of the 23rd of November, 1933; which regulations purport to derive their authority from sec. 7 (4) of the Income Tax Act of 1932, chap. 9 of the Statutes of that year.\nThese assessments are, in my opinion, invalid for the reason that the regulation pursuant to which they purport to be made either does not apply to the appellant company, or was beyond the powers of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council.\nThe special provision governing the appellant company in respect of income tax is sec. 21a of the Statute of 1932, which is in these words:\u2014\nThe income liable to taxation under this Act of every person residing outside of Saskatchewan, who is carrying on business in Saskatchewan, either directly or through or in the name of any other person, shall be the net profit or gain arising from the business of such person in Saskatchewan. The appellant company is admittedly resident outside of Saskatchewan, within the meaning of this provision; and the business of the Company in Saskatchewan is limited to making contracts of sale by its agents and by them receiving the proceeds of such sales. The profits of the Company are derived from a series of operations, including the purchase of raw material or partly manufactured articles, completely manufacturing its products and transporting and selling them, and receiving the proceeds of such sales. The essence of its profit making business is a series of operations as a whole. That part of the proceeds of sales in Saskatchewan which is profits is received in Saskatchewan, but it does not follow, of course, that the whole of such profit \"arises from\" that part of the Company's business which is carried on there within the contemplation of section 21a; and I think such a conclusion is negatived when the language of this section is contrasted with that of other sections of the Act.\nBy section 3, income is defined; and income of the kind we are considering, profits of a business, is \"profits *. * * received by a person * * * from any trade, manufacture or business * * * whether derived from sources within Saskatchewan or elsewhere.\"\nIt is clear, I think, that the effect of the words \"net profit or gain arising from the business of such person in Saskatchewan\" in section 21a is, for the purpose of that section, to delete from the definition of income in section 3 the words \"or elsewhere.\"\nThis view of section 21a is fortified by the language of other provisions. In section 4 it is enacted:\u2014\nThe following incomes shall not be liable to taxation hereunder:\n***\n(m) profits earned by a corporation or joint stock company * * * in that part of its business carried on at a branch or agency outside of Saskatchewan.\n\"Branch or agency\" seems to point to companies having their principal place of business in Saskatchewan and it is, perhaps, to such companies that the subsection is primarily directed. The word \"agency\" may be comprehensive enough to extend to any establishment of the Company, even at the place of its head office; but it is sufficient to point out that even in the case of companies whose seat of business is in Saskatchewan, the policy of the Statute is to remove from the incidence of income tax profits \"earned\" at \"branches or agencies\" elsewhere, without regard to the place where those profits may have been received.\nThe language of sections 23 and 24 seems also to give support to the view that the profits taxable under section 21a as \"arising from the business\" of a non-resident \"in Saskatchewan\" are that part of such profits as is \"earned\" therein.\nMr. Bastedo relied upon Commissioners of Taxation v. Kirk[3], and I think, with respect, that the judgment of Lord Davey, speaking for the Judicial Committee, is helpful in the elucidation of the Statute before us.\nThe income in question was in part derived from ore extracted from land in New South Wales and from the conversion there of this ore into a merchantable product. The Income Tax Statute of New South Wales charged within income tax income \"derived from lands of the Crown held under lease or licence\" in New South Wales, and income \"arising or accruing\" from \"any other source\" in New South Wales. The Statute provided that \"no tax shall be payable in respect of income earned\" outside New South Wales. The company whose income came into question in that case was a mining company owning and working mines in New South Wales, the crude ore being there converted for the most part into concentrates. Almost the whole of the ore so treated was sold and the contracts for sale were made outside New South Wales. The Supreme Court of New South Wales held, following a previous decision, In re Tindal[4], that the whole of the income included in the proceeds of sales was earned and arose at the place where the sales were made and the proceeds of the sales received, and that, consequently, no part of such proceeds was taxable as income in New South Wales.\nThis judgment was reversed by the Judicial Committee. Their Lordships said at pp. 592 and 593:\u2014\nTheir Lordships attach no special meaning to the word \"derived,\" which they treat as synonymous with arising or accruing. It appears to their Lordships that there are four processes in the earning or production of this income: (1) the extraction of the ore from the soil; (2) the conversion of the crude ore into a merchantable product, which is a manufacturing process; (3) the sale of the merchantable product; (4) the receipt of the moneys arising from the sale. All these processes are necessary stages which terminate in money, and the income is the money resulting less the expenses attendant on all the stages. The first process seems to their Lordships clearly within sub-s. 3, and the second or manufacturing process, if not within the meaning of \"trade\" in sub-s. 1, is certainly included in the words \"any other source whatever\" in sub-s. 4.\nSo far as relates to these two processes, therefore, their Lordships think that the income was earned and arising and accruing in New South Wales. * * * This point was, if possible, more plainly brought out in Tindal's case[5]. * * * The question in that case, as here, should have been what income was arising or accruing to Tindal from the business operations carried on by him in the Colony.\nThe fallacy of the judgment of the Supreme Court in this and in Tindal's case5 is in leaving out of sight the initial stages, and fastening their attention exclusively on the final stage in the production of the income.\nThe distinction under the Statute there in question between \"income received\" and \"income earned\" is signalized by their Lordships in these observations at p. 592:\u2014\nNor is it material whether the income is received in the Colony or not if it is earned outside the Colony. The Supreme Court have thought in Tindal's case5 and in these cases that the income was not earned in New South Wales because the finished products were sold exclusively outside the Colony.\nThe Deputy Attorney-General in his able argument contended that by sec. 21a of the Saskatchewan Act all profits received in Saskatchewan by a company having its residence outside Saskatchewan are taxable as profits \"arising out\" of that part of the company's business carried on in Saskatchewan. Sufficient has been said to indicate the grounds upon which, I think, considerations on which their Lordships in the Judicial Committee proceeded in Kirk's case[6] are pertinent here, and lead to the conclusion that this contention of the Crown ought not to be accepted.\nI now turn to the regulation, the pertinent parts of which are as follows:\u2014\nCovering such cases where the Minister is unable to determine or obtain information required to ascertain the income within the Province of a corporation or joint stock company carrying on a trade or business within and without the Province.\n1. Interest, dividends, rents and royalties less their proportionate share of deductions allowed shall be separately determined or ascertained, and if they are received in connection with the trade or business of the taxpayer in the Province, shall be income liable to taxation. 2. The income referred to in regulation 1 having been separately determined and ascertained, the remainder of the income of the taxpayer liable to taxation shall be taken to be such percentage of the remainder of the income as the sales within the Province bear to the total sales.\nThe income with which we are concerned is that dealt with in paragraph two. The method of determination, as it is put in the regulation, is to ascertain the ratio of the sales within the province to the total sales of the company and then apply that ratio to the income. Income, for our present purpose, of course, means profits. I think, perhaps, I can explain my way of looking at the regulation more clearly by calling attention to the fact that the subject of taxation, as determined by this method, is a percentage of the sales in Saskatchewan, a percentage which is identical with the ratio between total profits and total sales. Assume, for example, that the total sales amount to one hundred units of money and the total profits to twelve units of money and the sales in Saskatchewan to fifteen units of money. Then the subject of taxation is twelve per cent. of fifteen, an expression which, of course, is arithmetically identical with the expression fifteen per cent. of twelve, the form in which it is put in the regulation. In other words, under the regulation the subject of income tax is that part of the sales in Saskatchewan which is profit; that is to say, the whole of the profit received in Saskatchewan. This view of the effect of the regulation was not disputed by Mr. Quigg, who, as above intimated, supported it in argument as a proper application of the statutory provisions. I humbly think that this is a procedure wholly inadmissible under the Statute. Nowhere does the Statute authorize the Province of Saskatchewan to tax a manufacturing company, situated as the appellant company is, in respect of the whole of the profits received by the company in Saskatchewan. It is not the profits received in Saskatchewan that are taxable; it is the profits arising from its business in Saskatchewan, not the profits arising from the company's manufacturing business in Ontario and from the company's operations in Saskatchewan taken together, but the profits arising from the company's operations in Saskatchewan.\nSection 7 (4), which is the enactment under which the Lieutenant-Governor in Council receives his authority to make regulations, limits that authority to making regulations \"for determining such income within the province\"; \"such income\" being (it cannot be anything else) the income contemplated by the taxing provisions of the Statute as the subject of income tax; that is to say, in the case of companies not resident in Saskatchewan, the profits arising out of that part of their business that is carried on in Saskatchewan. The regulation, consequently, if it applies to non-resident companies such as the appellant company, is not competently made, because the aim of it is not within the purpose for which the statutory authority is given to the Lieutenant-Governor in Council. The aim of the regulation is to determine the profits received by such companies in Saskatchewan. The authority is to make regulations for determining the net profits as limited and defined by section 21a.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the assessments set aside. The appellant company should have its costs throughout.\nThe judgment of Rinfret, Crocket and Kerwin JJ. was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014The appellant is a company incorporated under the Companies Act of the Province of Ontario, having its head office in the city of Hamilton, in that province. It is registered under the provisions of the Saskatchewan Companies Act.\nThe business of the appellant is the manufacture and sale of agricultural implements and parts thereof and business incidental thereto. The manufacture of these implements and parts is carried on by the appellant entirely outside the province of Saskatchewan. The sale is carried on partly in the province of Saskatchewan and partly in other provinces of Canada and in other countries.\nAll sales made in Saskatchewan of the appellant's goods are made by the agents of the appellant, at its various branch offices in Saskatchewan; and the sale contracts in respect of such goods are made and executed in Saskatchewan.\nAll moneys received by the appellant in Saskatchewan, whether in respect of sales or as payments on debts owing to the appellant, are deposited in separate bank accounts and remitted in full to the head office of the appellant in Hamilton, Ontario. There are no directors of the appellant resident in Saskatchewan and no meetings of the Board of Directors of the appellant are held in that province. The central management and control of the appellant are held in the province of Ontario.\nThe appellant keeps no separate profit and loss account in respect of the business it carries on in the province of Saskatchewan. It only keeps at its head office a profit and loss account of its entire business carried on in Canada and elsewhere.\nThe province of Saskatchewan levies a tax upon incomes authorized by The Income Tax Act, 1932, which later was followed by a new Act (practically a consolidation of the former Act and its amendments) assented to on April 1st, 1936. This Act of 1936 replaced the Act of 1932 which it repealed, except in certain respects, of which more will have to be said later.\nUnder the Act of 1932, every person liable to taxation shall on or before the thirty-first day of May in each year deliver to the Minister a return in such form as the Minister may prescribe of any total income during the last preceding year.\nThe Minister here means the Provincial Treasurer.\n\"Person\" is defined in the Act, s. 2 (8):\nAn individual, and includes a guardian, trustee, executor, administrator, agent, receiver or any other individual, firm or corporation, acting in a fiduciary capacity, and the heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns of such person.\nFor the purpose of the Act, \"Income\" is defined:\nThe annual net profit or gain or gratuity, whether ascertained and capable of computation as being wages, salary or other fixed amount, or unascertained as being fees or emoluments, or as being profits from a trade or commercial or financial or other business or calling, directly or indirectly received by a person from any office or employment, or from any profession or calling, or from any trade, manufacture or business, as the case may be, whether derived from sources within Saskatchewan or elsewhere; and includes the interest, dividends or profits directly or indirectly received from money at interest upon any security or without security, or from stocks, or from any other investment, and whether such gains or profits are divided or distributed or not, and also the annual profit or gain from any other source [sec. 3].\nIt is stated that \"any other source\" includes:\n(a) the income from, but not the value of, property acquired by gift, bequest, devise or descent; and (b) the income from but not the proceeds of life insurance policies * * *\n(c) the salaries, indemnities or other remuneration of all persons whatsoever, whether the said salaries, indemnities or remuneration are paid out of the revenue of His Majesty in respect of his Government of Canada, or of any province thereof, or by any person, except as herein otherwise provided,\" and\n(d) all other gains or profits of any kind derived from any source within or without the province whether received in money or its equivalent.\nThe Act then provides (sec. 4) for certain exemptions and deductions, of which only subs, (m) need be quoted:\n(m) profits earned by a corporation or joint stock company, other than a personal corporation, in that part of its business carried on at a branch or agency outside of Saskatchewan.\nIt should merely be mentioned that the appellant is not a \"personal corporation\" within the definition of the Act (s. 2, subs. 9).\nThe liability to tax is imposed upon corporations and joint stock companies, no matter how created or organized, carrying on business within the province, at the rate applicable thereto set forth in the first schedule of the Act, upon income during the preceding year exceeding one thousand dollars (s. 7, subs. 3).\nAfter examination of the taxpayer's return, already referred to and provided for by sec. 29, the Minister must send a notice of assessment to the taxpayer verifying or altering the amount of the tax as estimated by him in his return; and any additional tax found due over the amount already paid by the taxpayer in accordance with sec. 44 (which provides for the payment of not less than one-quarter of the amount of the tax at the time when the return of the income is made) must then be paid within one month from the date of the mailing of the notice of assessment (s. 51).\nThe Act then authorizes an appeal to the Minister by any person, corporation or joint stock company who or which objects to the amount at which he or it is assessed, or considers that he or it is not liable to taxation (sec. 53).\nUpon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Minister considers the same and is empowered to affirm or amend the assessment appealed against.\nAn appeal lies from the decision of the Minister to a Judge of the Court of King's Bench (s. 54). At the hearing of the appeal, the Judge hears and considers the cause upon the material filed by the Minister, and upon any further evidence which the appellant or the Crown may produce at the discretion of the Judge. The Judge may affirm, amend or disallow the assessment and it is enacted that \"his decision shall be final in all matters relating to the appeal, and there shall be no appeal therefrom.\"\nBy an Act to amend the Act of 1932 (which came into force on April 7th, 1934) \"person\" was declared to include \"any body corporate and politic and any association or other body, and the heirs, * * *.\" (subs. 2 of s. 2 of ch. 5 of the Statutes of 1934).\nThe administration of the Act and the control and the management of the collection of the taxes imposed thereby was entrusted to the Provincial Treasurer (s. 61); but it was provided that the Minister could authorize the Commissioner of Income Tax, appointed pursuant to the provisions of the Act, to exercise such of the powers conferred by the Act upon the Minister as may, in the opinion of the Minister, be conveniently exercised by the Commissioner (s. 61 (2)).\nIn 1935 (c. 16 of the Statutes of 1934-1935), the Act of 1932 was amended by providing for an appeal to the Board of Revenue Commissioners in lieu of the appeal to the Minister, and by striking out the word \"Minister\" wherever it occurred in matters relating to the appeal and substituting for it the word \"Board.\"\nThen the Income Tax Act, 1936, came into force on April 1st of that year (c. 15 of the Statutes of 1936). The scheme of this new Act is practically the same as that of the Act of 1932, including the amendments already mentioned, but with some differences which will be mentioned shortly.\nOn the 28th May, 1935, the appellant filed with the Commissioner of Income Tax its return of income for the taxation year 1934.\nOn the 2nd day of June, 1936, the appellant filed its return for the year 1935.\nOn the 26th of May, 1937, the appellant filed its return of income for the period of ten months ending the 31st October, 1936. Prior to assessing the appellant's income for the years 1934, 1935 and 1936, the Commissioner of Income Tax asked for certain information from the appellant. The appellant gave the information on the 6th day of June, 1938. The Commissioner asked for further information, which was given on the 8th of July, 1938.\nThe Commissioner did not request any further information, nor did the appellant supply any.\nOn the 23rd August, 1938, the Commissioner made an assessment in the sum of $4,382.07 in respect of the income of the appellant for the taxation year 1934, an assessment in the sum of $11,341.07 in respect of the income of the appellant for the taxation year 1935, and an assessment in the sum of $10,136.60 in respect of the income for the period of ten months ending on the 31st October, 1936.\nThere was an appeal to the Board of Revenue Commissioners in respect of the assessment for each of the years 1934, 1935 and 1936.\nThe Board dismissed the three appeals and affirmed the three assessments.\nAgain there was an appeal from the Board to a King's Bench judge. The latter (Anderson J.) again dismissed the three appeals and confirmed the decision of the Board of Revenue Commissioners.\nThe matter was then carried to the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan, which adjudged that there was no right of appeal from the decision of the judge in chambers in respect of the assessment for the taxation year 1934. The appeal in regard to it was accordingly dismissed on the ground that the Court of Appeal had no jurisdiction to entertain the same.\nThe Court adjudged, however, that it had jurisdiction to entertain the appeals against the assessments for the taxation years 1935 and 1936. It held that they were defective in that they did not make provision for the appellant being allowed any deduction in respect of a reserve for bad debts. It ordered, therefore, that the said assessments be set aside; that the Commissioner, in making new assessments for the years 1935 and 1936, should reconsider the question of a reserve for bad debts in the light of the reasons for judgment of that Court and should exercise the discretion vested in him by s. 6 (d) of the Income Tax Act, 1936, upon sound principles. By special leave of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan, the Company now appeals from the judgment of that Court\nexcept that part of the said judgment or order setting aside the said assessments for the taxation years 1935 and 1936 because they are defective in so far as a reserve for bad debts is concerned, as ordered in clauses 2 and 3 of the formal judgment, the part of the judgment or order of the Court of Appeal appealed from being clause 1 of the formal judgment or order of this Court and the judgment or decision of this Court that on all other grounds, except with respect to the deduction in respect of a reserve for bad debts, the appellant's appeals fail and including the disallowance by this Court of one-third of the appellant's costs of its appeals to this Court and a Judge of the Court of King's Bench.\nThe first point to be considered is whether, as the Court of Appeal has decided, there was a right of appeal to it with respect to the taxation years 1935 and 1936; and the second point is whether there also existed a right of appeal to that Court in respect of the taxation year 1934. As pointed out in the Court of Appeal, these questions of its jurisdiction are not without difficulty. The numerous amendments to the Acts of 1932 and 1936 are not clear and are not made clearer by the introduction of certain other provisions in the successive Treasury Department Acts (c. 6 of the Statutes of 1934-1935; c. 8 of the Statutes of 1938; c. 5 of the Statutes of 1939, and c. 5 and c. 6 of the Statutes of 1940).\nIt has already been mentioned that, under the scheme of the Act of 1932, there was a right of appeal to the Minister from the assessment originally made upon the return of a person liable to taxation under the Act; and a further right of appeal from the decision of the Minister to a Judge of the Court of King's Bench, who could affirm, amend, or disallow the assessment and whose decision was declared to be final in all matters relating to the appeal and from whom it was enacted that \"there shall be no appeal\" (s. 54(5)).\nWe have also seen that in 1935, for purposes of appeal under s. 53 of the 1932 Act, the Board of Revenue Commissioners was substituted to the Minister.\nThis Board had been created by An Act to amend The Treasury Department Act (c. 6 of the Statutes of 1934-35, assented to February 21st, 1935). By sec. 2 of the Act to amend The Treasury Department Act, the Lieutenant-Governor in Council was given the authority to appoint a Board of Revenue Commissioners consisting of three members, with power to hear appeals respecting the payment of taxes or other moneys due to the Crown; and its decisions thereon were declared to be final and not subject to further appeals, unless otherwise provided for in any revenue Act.\nIt is common ground that the taxes respecting which the Board was given power to hear appeals would include taxes levied under the Income Tax Act of 1932 or 1936. It was further conceded that the words \"in any revenue Act\" would include the Income Tax Act.\nAfter the creation in 1935, as above mentioned, of the Board of Revenue Commissioners, there came into force the new Income Tax Act of 1936, which provided for returns to the Commissioner to be made by every person liable to taxation under the Act, for an assessment to be made by the Commissioner after examination of the return made by the taxpayer, and for an appeal to the Board of Revenue Commissioners, apointed under the provisions of The Treasury Department Act, by any person who objected to the amount at which he was assessed or who considered that he was not liable to taxation.\nThe 1936 Income Tax Act empowered the Board to duly consider the appeal and to affirm or amend the assessment appealed against (s. 57). An appeal was provided from the decision of the Board to a Judge of the Court of King's Bench (s. 58); and the Act of 1936, as it stood at first, empowered the Judge to affirm, amend or disallow the assessment; but it enacted that his decision should be final in all matters relating to the appeal and that there should be no appeal therefrom.\nHowever, in 1937, the Income Tax Act, 1936, was amended by c. 8 of the Statutes of 1937, which came into force on April 16th of that year, and therein (s. 6) the Commissioner or any other interested person was given the right of appeal from the decision of the Judge to the Court of Appeal, as if such decision were a judgment in an action between subject and subject, with the proviso that there should be no further or other appeal.\nThen in 1939 (c. 9 of the Statutes of 1939), it was further provided that the appeal from the decision of the Board and any further appeal should be subject to and governed by the provisions of secs. 41 and 42 of the Treasury Department Act, 1938 (s. 16 of c. 9 of the Statutes of 1939).\nAnd if we now turn to sections 41 and 42 of the Treasury Department Act, 1938, referred to in sec. 16 of the statute just mentioned, we find that, under those sections 41 and 42, an appeal shall lie to a Judge of the Court of King's Bench from a decision of the Board on a question of law arising in an appeal to it under clause (a) of subsec. 8 of sec. 40 (N.B.: Clause (a) of subs. 8 of s. 40 empowers the Board to hear appeals respecting the payment of taxes or other moneys due to the Crown). As for s. 42 of the Treasury Department Act, 1938, it enacts that the Provincial Tax Commission, with the consent of the Attorney-General, or any other interested person may appeal from the decision of the Judge to the Court of Appeal as if such decision were a judgment between subject and subject, but that there shall be no further or other appeal.\nAnd again, in 1940, by An Act to amend The Treasury Department Act, 1938 (No. 1), being c. 5 of the Statutes of 1940, it was provided that the appeal from the decision of the Judge may be made\nin the same manner as an appeal may foe taken in any action or cause in the Court of King's Bench to which His Majesty is a party, and the practice and procedure relating to appeals shall apply to such appeal, provided that where an appeal has been taken to the Court of Appeal there shall be no further or other appeal except in cases Where the constitutional validity of any statute of the province or regulations made thereunder is brought into question.\nAnd it was further provided that the right of appeal already given by the Treasury Department Act of 1938 (c. 8 of the Statutes of 1938, secs. 41 and 42) shall not apply\nwhere provision is made by any revenue Act for an appeal from the decision of the Board differing in character from the appeal herein provided for\n(Sec. 3 of c. 5 of (he Statutes of 1940). And it was enacted that, upon an appeal to a judge of the Court of King's Bench, the proceedings would thereupon become a cause in that court, provided that in all cases the facts shall be regarded as having been conclusively established by the findings of the Board except where a question is raised on the appeal that the finding of any particular fact or facts has been made by the Board upon evidence which does not warrant such finding.\nThe same chapter 5 of the Statutes of 1940 (s. 4 (2)) finally enacts that the sections which provide that the proceeding shall become a cause\nshall be applicable to any judgment of the Court of Appeal delivered subsequently to the coming into force of this Act notwithstanding that the appeal to that Court was taken and heard prior hereto.\nA further amendment must be mentioned to the Treasury Department Act, 1938. That amendment was introduced by chapter 6 of the Statutes of 1940, assented to on March 16th of that year. It provides that upon the appeal to a Judge of the Court of King's Bench, the latter may refer the matter of assessment back to the Provincial Tax Commission for further consideration; and likewise the Court of Appeal, upon an appeal to it, may refer the matter of assessment back to the Provincial Tax Commission for further consideration; and the Act \"shall be read and construed as if the foregoing amendments had always been included therein.\"\nOn this extremely complicated legislation the Court of Appeal held they had no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal from the assessment with respect to the income for 1934 but that it was competent to hear and decide the appeals from the assessments with respect to the income for 1935 and 1936. I do not repeat the reasons of the learned Chief Justice of Saskatchewan (concurred in by MacKenzie and Gordon JJ. A.) for maintaining the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal respecting the assessments for 1935 and 1936; they are expressed to my satisfaction and I have nothing to add to them. As for the assessment for 1934, the following observations lead me to the conclusion that an appeal with respect to it could equally be brought before the Court of Appeal.\nWhen the appellant was called upon to deliver his return for the taxation year 1934, the Act of 1932 applied both to the income showed in that return and to the assessment thereafter to be made upon such income. As the law then stood, the Board of Revenue Commissioners, appointed under the provisions of the Treasury Department Act (as amended by c. 6 of the Statutes of 1934-5, assented to February 21st, 1935), had been created a few months before. The right of appeal provided for by s. 53 of the Act of 1932, which had heretofore to be brought before the Provincial Treasurer, had been transferred to the Board empowered to \"hear appeals respecting the\npayment of taxes or other moneys due to the Crown\" (s. 20 (a) of the Treasury Department Act as amended by c. 6 of the Statutes of 1934-1935). Admittedly, that would include taxes upon income. It was, however, enacted in the Treasury Department Act that the decision of the Board \"shall be final and not subject to further appeal unless otherwise provided for in any revenue Act.\" In view of such proviso, the appeal to a Judge of the Court of King's Bench (s. 54 of the Act of 1932) was preserved under the Income Tax Act, 1932, it being a \"revenue Act.\" And as the legislation then stood, the Judge of the Court of King's Bench could affirm, amend or disallow the assessment; and his decision was to be final in all matters relating to the appeal; and there could be no appeal therefrom (subs. 5 of s. 54 of the Act of 1932).\nHowever, the assessment on the return made by the appellant for 1934 was completed and notified to the taxpayer only on the 23rd August, 1938. In the meantime, the legislation relating to appeals in such matters had undergone a very important change. In most instances, the Commissioner of Income Tax had replaced the Provincial Treasurer for the purposes of the administration of the Act, and the Board of Revenue Commissioners had been substituted to the Minister in several other instances, more particularly with regard to appeals.\nBy the Treasury Department Act, 1938 (ch. 8 of the Statutes of 1938, assented to March 23rd, 1938), new provisions with regard to appeals had been introduced in the Saskatchewan legislation \"respecting the payment of taxes or other moneys due to the Crown\" (subs. 8 (a) of s. 40 of the Treasury Department Act, 1938). Under these new provisions, a right of appeal was provided first to \"a Judge of the Court of King's Bench from the decision of the Board on a question of law arising in an appeal to it\" (s. 41 (1)); and a further appeal was authorized \"from the decision of the Judge to the Court of Appeal as if such decision was a judgment in an action between subject and subject, but there shall be no further or other appeal\" (s. 42).\nMoreover, the Income Tax Act, 1936, had come into force and therein was provided a right of appeal from the assessment, 1\u00b0, to \"the Board of Revenue Commissioners appointed under the provisions of The Treasury Department Act\" (s. 57); 2\u00b0, to a Judge of the Court of King's Bench (s. 58); and 3\u00b0, to the Court of Appeal (s. 58a inserted by section 6 of c. 8 of the Statutes of 1937, assented to April 16th, 1937).\nNo doubt, on March 23rd, 1938, by the Statute Law Amendment Act (c. 91 of 1938), sections 58 and 58a of the Income Tax Act, 1936, were repealed; but on the same day the Treasury Department Act, 1938, was assented to and it provided, as we have seen above, for the appeal to a Judge of the Court of King's Bench and from the decision of that Judge to the Court of Appeal. The inference is reasonable and logical, to the point of it being obvious, that the reason for repealing secs. 58 and 58a of the Income Tax Act, 1936, was precisely because similar provisions, on the same day, came into force under sections 41 and 42 of the Treasury Department Act, 1938. This inference is strengthened by the insertion in the Income Tax Act, 1936, of a new sec. 58 reading as follows:\n58. An appeal from a decision of the Board and any further appeal shall be subject to and governed by the provisions of sections 41 and 42 of The Treasury Department Act, 1938. [Sec. 16 of c. 9 of the Statutes of 1939].\nIn my view, it is apparent that, even prior to the date when the return of 1934 was due to be filed by the taxpayer, the legislature had set out a new machinery covering the whole question of appeals from assessments in taxation matters, including the income tax; and, in this case, there was, in fact, an appeal asserted to the Board of Revenue Commissioners which had been substituted to the Minister, without there being any objection forthcoming from either the Provincial Tax Commission or the Commissioner of Income Tax or the Provincial Treasurer, or the Attorney-General for Saskatchewan. Indeed, everybody appears to have taken for granted that the appeal from the assessment of 1934 had to be brought before the Board, instead of before the Minister. That it was so will be still more apparent if we are to take the statement made at bar before this Court that the only revenue Act in Saskatchewan providing for a right of appeal at all was the Income Tax Act.\nUnder those circumstances, it seems to me that from the moment the Board of Revenue Commissioners was created, the intention of the Legislature in the Treasury Department Act was to cover the whole field of appeals in taxation matters. Without it the legislation was incapable of proper operation.\nThe effect of the coming into force of the Treasury Department Act and its subsequent amendments was impliedly to repeal the provisions concerning appeals contained in the Income Tax Act which became inconsistent or repugnant. \"The latest expression of the will of Parliament must always prevail\" (Maxwell on the Interpretation of Statutes, 8th ed., p. 139; Craies on Statute Law, 4th ed., p. 310, and cases cited).\nOf course, the respondent points to sections 73 and 74 of the Income Tax Act, 1936, whereby it is enacted that the Act of 1936\nshall apply to incomes earned or received in the year 1935 and to incomes in respect of fiscal years ending subsequently to the thirty-first day of August, 1935.\nand that\nthe following enactments are hereby repealed:\n22 George V, 1932, c. 9;\n23 George V, 1933, c. 9;\n24 George V, 1934, c. 5;\n25 George V, 1934-35, c. 16.\nwith the following proviso:\n(2) Notwithstanding the repeal of the enactments mentioned in subsection (1), the said enactments shall continue to apply to incomes earned or received in the years 1931, 1932, 1933 and 1934 and to incomes in respect of fiscal years ending prior to the first day of September, 1935, to the same extent as if the said enactments had not been repealed.\nBut the answer to the respondent's objection is that, by the very terms of the proviso, the enactments of the Act of 1932 and its amendments continue to apply to incomes of 1934 only, of course, in so far as they were still in force previous to the repeal of the 1932 Act by the Act of 1936; and, as explained above, in matters of appeal, these enactments were no longer applicable because of the provisions inconsistent thereto contained in the Treasury Department Act. A further answer to the respondent's contention appears to be that, despite the repeal of the 1932 Act and amendments by the 1936 Act, the Act of 1932 continued to apply to incomes earned or received in the year 1934, that is to say, to incomes as such; but, for the purposes of assessment and of appeals therefrom the Act of 1936 would prevail. This is the more likely since, in the meantime, the scheme of assessment and of appeals had been changed and taken away from the Provincial Treasurer to the Commissioner and to the Board of Revenue Commissioners; and it should not be forgotten that, in this case, so far as the 1934 return is concerned, we are dealing with an assessment made only on the 23rd day of August, 1938, and \"under the provisions of The Income Tax Act, 1936.\"\nMy conclusion, therefore, is that the appellant had a right of appeal to the Court of Appeal even from the assessment for the taxation year 1934. To that extent, the appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal should be allowed and that judgment varied accordingly.\nThe other points raised in this appeal concern the alleged errors in law in the judgment of the Court of Appeal with regard to the method of assessment adopted by the Commissioner of Income Tax and approved successively by the Board of Revenue Commissioners, by the Judge of the Court of King's Bench and by the Court of Appeal; and concern the manner in which the Court of Appeal disposed of the question pertaining to the \"reserve for bad debts.\"\nDealing first with the method of assessment, the point comes up in this way. Under the Income Tax Act, 1932, regulations were issued\ncovering such cases where the Minister is unable to determine or obtain information required to ascertain the income within the province of a corporation or joint stock company carrying on a trade or business within and without the province.\nThese regulations provide as follows:\n1. Interest, dividends, rents and royalties less their proportionate share of deduction allowed shall be separately determined or ascertained, and if they are received in connection with the trade or business of the taxpayer in the Province, shall be income liable to taxation.\n2. The income referred to in regulation 1 having been separately determined and ascertained, the remainder of the income of the taxpayer liable to taxation shall be taken to be such percentage of the remainder of the income as the sales within the Province bear to the total sales. The sales of the taxpayer shall be measured by the gross amount which the taxpayer has received during the preceding year from sales and other sources in connection with the said business, excluding, however, receipts from the sale or exchange of capital, assets and property not sold in the regular course of business and also receipts from interest, dividends, rents and royalties the income of which has been separately determined or ascertained under the provisions of regulation 1.\n***\n4. If a taxpayer believes that the method of allocation and apportionment herein prescribed or as determined and as applied to his business, has operated or will so operate as to subject him to taxation on a greater portion of his income than is reasonably attributable to business or sources within the Province, he shall be entitled to file with the Commissioner a statement of his objections and of such alternative method of allocation and apportionment as he believes to be proper under the circumstances, with such details and proof and within such time as the Commissioner may reasonably prescribe, and if the Commissioner shall conclude that the method of allocation and apportionment heretofore employed is in fact not applicable or equitable, he shall re-determine the taxable income by such other method of allocation and apportionment as seems best calculated to assign to the Province for taxation the portion of the income reasonably attributable to business and sources within the Province.\n5. These regulations shall not be applied to determine the income within the Province of a corporation or joint stock company carrying on a trade or business within and without the Province where\n(a) the method or system of accounting used by the taxpayer enables the Commissioner to determine or to obtain the information required to ascertain the income of the taxpayer liable to taxation.\n(b) the income of the taxpayer liable to taxation can be determined or ascertained by allowing the exemption provided by paragraph (m) of section 4 of the Income Tax Act, 1932.\nIt is conceded that, although these regulations were issued under the Act of 1932, they have continued in force and are applicable under the Act of 1936. Paragraph (m) of s. 4, referred to in the regulations, is to the effect that \"profits earned by a corporation or joint stock company, other than a personal corporation, in that part of its business carried on at a branch or agency outside of Saskatchewan,\" shall not be considered as income liable to taxation under the Act.\nThe regulations were made pursuant to subsection 4 of section 7 of the Act of 1932 (a similar provision is contained in the Act of 1936, subsection 4 of section 9). These subsections, both in the Act of 1932 and in the Act of 1936, read as follows:\nWhere the minister is unable to determine or to obtain the information required to ascertain the income within the province of any corporation or joint stock company or of any class of corporations or joint stock companies, the Lieutenant-Governor in Council may, on the recommendation of the minister, make regulations for determining such income within the province or may fix or determine the tax to be paid by a corporation or joint stock company liable to taxation.\nIt was contended by the appellant that the regulations did not apply to the appellant's returns in the present case, because the Act apparently provides for a special regulation for the purpose of determining a special income in each particular case of persons or corporations liable to taxation; but the statute does not seem to be incapable of being construed as authorizing the Lieutenant-Governor in Council to make regulations, such as those we have before us, to apply in all cases \"where the minister is unable to determine or to obtain the information required to ascertain the income.\"\nIndeed it would seem that such construction is more reasonable and equitable because the effect would then be to put on an equal footing all cases where that situation obtains, instead of being limited to empowering the Lieutenant-Governor in Council to make for each case different regulations which might operate in a way to discriminate between the several taxpayers.\nThe regulations as made by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, in the premises, avoid this possible objection and would appear, therefore, to be more within the purpose of the Act.\nA further objection to the application of the regulations in this case was put forward by counsel for the appellant. He says that, both by virtue of the Act and of the regulations themselves, the latter may be applied only \"where the Minister is unable to determine or to obtain the information required to ascertain the income within the province\"; but it should be remembered that the right of appeal to this Court, as well as to the Court of Appeal, is strictly limited to \"a question of law arising in the appeal.\" The question whether the proper method of fixing or determining the tax was adopted by the Commissioner, consistently with the Act and the regulations, is, no doubt, a question of law; but the question whether the condition precedent existed as a result of which resort could be had to the special method of allocation provided for by the Act and by the regulations, i.e., whether the Minister was \"unable to determine or to obtain the information required to ascertain the income within the province,\" while it may be a decision strictly within the Minister's discretion, is, at all events, a pure question of fact with which this Court cannot concern itself.\nIt may be added that there was here almost superfluous evidence in support of the contention that the condition precedent existed. Such was the finding, not only of the Commissioner, but also of the Board of Revenue Commissioners, the Judge of the Court of King's Bench and the Court of Appeal. Had we had authority to entertain the objection, it would have been hopeless for the appellant to expect that this Court would interfere. In fact, in all its returns, the appellant itself resorted to the method of allocation and apportionment; and, in its return of 1935, it admitted that it was \"necessary, therefore, to ascertain its net income in Saskatchewan by an allocation method.\"\nThis objection cannot seriously be envisaged.\nBut the appellant then contends that the effect of the regulations is to go beyond the powers conferred by the statute and that they are ultra vires and unconstitutional, because, first, they are not authorized in their present form by the Acts of 1932 or 1936; and, second, the result is to tax property outside of Saskatchewan and, as a consequence, to encroach upon the powers exclusively reserved to the Dominion Parliament under the B.N.A. Act.\nIn order to decide these two objections of the appellant it becomes necessary to return to a consideration of the statutes and regulations. The Acts specify that\nThe income liable to taxation under this Act of every person residing outside of Saskatchewan, who is carrying on business in Saskatchewan, either directly or through or in the name of any other person, shall be the net profit or gain arising from the business of such person in Saskatchewan.\nThe regulations limit their application to\nInterest, dividends, rents and royalties * * * received in connection with the trade or business of the taxpayer in the Province,\nand they stipulate that\nthe remainder of the income of the taxpayer liable to taxation shall be taken to be such percentage of the remainder of the income as the sales within the Province bear to the total sales,\nthus indicating the intention to tax only the income arising from the business within the province. The same intention appears in Regulation No. 4, where it is stated that the method of allocation and apportionment therein prescribed is for the purpose of determining the income \"reasonably attributable to business and sources within the Province.\"\nRegulation No. 5 expressly states that \"these regulations shall not be applied to determine the income within the Province of a corporation or joint stock company\" where the method or system of accounting enables the Commissioner to obtain the information required to ascertain the income of the taxpayer liable to taxation or where the income of the taxpayer can be determined or ascertained by allowing the exemption provided by paragraph (m) of section 4 of the Act of 1932.\nAs we have already seen, that paragraph (m) exempts from taxation all \"profits earned by a corporation or joint stock company * * * in that part of its business carried on at a branch or agency outside of Saskatchewan.\"\nAccordingly, the aim of the 1932 and 1936 Acts, with respect to non-resident companies which carry on business in Saskatchewan, is to reach by taxation only the income arising from the business in the province. As a consequence, these Acts are well within sub-head 2 of section 92 of the B.N.A. Act (Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[7]).\nBy the Acts, the tax is upon income arising from the business in the province. In my humble opinion, the regulations do exactly the same thing. On this branch of the case, it should be pointed out that the amount to be taxed under the regulations is a percentage of the sales in Saskatchewan, and that percentage is identical with the ratio between the total profits and total sales. With respect, the amount so to be taxed does not necessarily exceed the amount of the net profit or gain arising from the business in Saskatchewan.\nIt was next argued that, even if the Acts are constitutional or the regulations are intra vires, yet in their operation in the present case they have the effect of taxing profits or gains which did not arise from the business of the appellant in Saskatchewan.\nAt the outset, the appellant is met by the difficulty that the question whether profits or gains arose within or without Saskatchewan is really a question of fact already decided against it by the Commissioner of Income Tax, the Board of Revenue Commissioners and the Judge of the Court of King's Bench. In an endeavour to transform that objection into a question of law, appellant's counsel stresses the point to the extent of saying that the application of the regulations necessarily includes in the assessment manufacturing profits said to have arisen exclusively outside Saskatchewan, i.e., at the head office of the appellant in Hamilton, Ontario, where the central management and control of the appellant abide (De Beers Consolidated Mines v. Howe[8]; Commissioners of Taxation v. Kirk[9]).\nSuch, in my view, was not the purpose of the Acts of Saskatchewan or of the regulations made thereunder and applied in the present case. The Commissioner, in making each assessment, intended to tax exclusively the profits and gains arising from the business of the appellant in Saskatchewan. Neither the Commissioner of Income Tax nor the Board of Revenue Commissioners meant to reach anything but the profits or gains arising from the business of the appellant in Saskatchewan; and the method adopted by them to obtain that object\u2014a method which was rendered necessary as a result of the fact that the appellant does not keep separate profit and loss accounts for the business it carries on in the Province of Saskatchewan, but keeps at its head office in Hamilton an account of its entire net profit and loss account for the business it carries on in Saskatchewan and elsewhere\u2014was nothing else than the adoption of the best available means to ascertain the income of the appellant arising from its business in Saskatchewan, and nothing more.\nThe appellant should be reminded of the words of Lord Shaw in the House of Lords in Attorney-General v. Till[10]:\nSuch powers are inserted in the Act simply because, in addition to all kinds of penalties, the Board of Inland Revenue must ingather taxation; and if the taxpayer will not furnish the information himself, some means must be provided of recovering the duty, and these powers are given to enable the Board to proceed with the best available estimate.\nThe appellant referred the Court to a great number of decisions on several statutes which may or may not, upon close examination, be found to contain provisions similar to the Acts of 1932 and 1936. The fallacy of attempting to apply these decisions to the present case is stated by Lord Davey, delivering the judgment of the Privy Council, in Commissioners of Taxation v. Kirk[11], and it is that these other Acts \"in language, and to some extent in aim, differ from the Acts now before\" this Court. As already pointed out, the appellant itself was driven to the admission that its exact and precise income arising from its business in Saskatchewan could not be ascertained, owing to its method of book-keeping and of keeping its profit and loss account. Under the circumstances, it was clearly necessary that the method of allocation and apportionment prescribed by the regulations should be resorted to by the Commissioner of Income Tax. It was the only method available to ascertain the income liable to taxation; and, like the Board of Revenue Commissioners and the other judges who have already passed upon this case, I think the appellant cannot complain.\nThere remains to discuss the point about bad debts.\nIn the order granting special leave to appeal to this Court, leave was granted to the appellant on all grounds decided by the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan,\nexcept that part of the said judgment or order setting aside the said assessments for the taxation years 1935 and 1936 because they are defective in so far as a reserve for bad debts is concerned, as ordered in clauses 2 and 3 of the formal judgment.\nIt follows that, of course, so far as the appellant was concerned, the decision of the Court of Appeal on this question in respect of the taxation years 1935 and 1936 was not open before this Court. Indeed, the appellant had no interest in getting leave to appeal from that part of the decision, since it had been rendered favourably to its contention. The question of the reserve for bad debts in the assessment for the taxation year 1934 (not decided by the Court of Appeal on account of its holding that it had no jurisdiction in respect of that particular year) was properly before this Court under the order granting special leave.\nThe legal points concerning that question are exactly the same as those discussed by the Court of Appeal with regard to the assessments of 1935 and 1936; and, therefore, this Court had to hear argument which, although confined in its effect to the 1934 assessment revenue, embraced exactly the same legal points as applied to the assessments for 1935 and 1936 decided by the Court of Appeal.\nDealing with such reserve for bad debts, the law of Saskatchewan is as follows (s. 6 (d) of the Acts of 1932 and of 1936):\nIn computing the amount of the profits or gains to foe assessed, a deduction shall not foe allowed in respect of:\n***\n(d) amounts transferred or credited to a reserve, contingent account or sinking fund, except such an amount for bad debts as the Commissioner may allow and except as otherwise provided in this Act.\nAs will be seen, the matter is, therefore, left somewhat to the discretion of the Commissioner \"except as otherwise provided in this Act\"; but, of course, the discretion must be exercised within legal grounds.\nIt was not suggested on either side that it was \"otherwise provided in this Act,\" so far, at least, as this case is concerned.\nBy virtue of the second paragraph of regulation No. 2 \"the sales of the taxpayer shall be measured by the gross amount which the taxpayer has received during the preceding year from sales.\" If taken by themselves, these words might be construed to mean \"money received,\" but these regulations cover cases where the Minister is unable to determine or obtain information required to ascertain the income, within the province, of a corporation carrying on business within and without the province; and the income under section 23 is \"the net profit or gain arising from the business * * * in Saskatchewan.\" The appellant company, following the well-established practice, included in its statement not only money received but also receivables such as notes, book debts, etc The Commissioner dealt with the present case upon that basis, and, therefore, what is to be compared under the regulations is the sales within the province with the total sales. They are to be measured by the contract prices in the year of charge, less that part thereof as has been shown to be uncollectable in that year and less an allowance for such other part that might turn out to be bad in the future. The result is that, in estimating the amount to be allowed for bad debts, the Commissioner must, first: allow for debts actually proven to have lost part or all of their original value; second: allow a reserve for losses which may eventually occur; but in the latter case he is bound by the provisions of sec. 6 (d) of the Act.\nThe taxpayer may deduct the amount of any debt found to have been bad in the year in which it is incurred; and, in addition, he may set aside from his profits whatever the Commissioner allows for the reserve.\nIn this instance, the Commissioner has allowed for all debts allegedly bad since the year 1931 and the following years; but he has allowed no provision for the reserve.\nAs pointed out by the Chief Justice of Saskatchewan, the allowance may be reasonable, but it is not warranted by law. In effect, it re-opens assessments for each year since 1931; and it operates practically as a refund, which is not authorized by the Income Tax Acts.\nIt is clear that the Commissioner should have allowed a reserve. He did not do so because of his interpretation of the law that he could provide for debts turning out to be bad in years subsequent to that of their being incurred. The statutes, however, did not allow him to do that.\nFor that reason, the assessments of 1935 and 1936 were found defective by the Court of Appeal and they were returned back to the Commissioner to exercise his discretion for the allowance of a reserve under sec. 6 (d) of the Act, \"upon sound principles.\"\nAlthough, no doubt, the matter was left to the discretion of the Commissioner, in so doing the Commissioner was performing a duty of a quasi-judicial character, and the discretion had to be exercised on proper legal principles. (Pioneer Laundry & Dry Cleaners Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue[12]).\nThe conclusion come to by the Court of Appeal, upon which their decision on that point was reached, and which was fully warranted by the evidence, was that the Commissioner did not apply his mind to this question in conformity with the law applicable thereto.\nNo satisfactory reason was put before this Court by the respondent as to why the grounds upon which this matter was decided by the Court of Appeal for the years 1935 and 1936 should not equally apply to the assessment made for the year 1934.\nAs a consequence, the appeal should be allowed. The assessment for the year 1934 should be set aside and referred back to the Commissioner for the same purpose as the assessments for 1935 and 1936 have already been referred back by the Court of Appeal. I say nothing as to the right of the respondent to cross-appeal because, in any event, that cross-appeal fails.\nThe appellant succeeds to the extent of securing the same order with respect to the assessment for 1934 as it had with respect to the assessments for 1935 and 1936. Under the circumstances and without disturbing the allocation of costs already made in the Court below, the appellant shall have one-half of its costs of the appeal to this Court, and the cross-appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nHudson J.\u2014This appeal concerns assessments of the appellant company in respect of income taxes imposed by the Province of Saskatchewan for the years 1934, 1935 and 1936. The statute applicable to the assessments for 1934 was a statute passed in 1932, and in respect of 1935 and 1936 a new Act passed in 1936, but, as the provisions of these two Acts, to which I wish to refer, are identical, for convenience I shall quote only the sections of the 1936 Act. That statute is chapter 15 of the Statutes of Saskatchewan. The charging section is section 9, of which subsections 3 and 4 must first be considered in this case. They are as follows:\n9. (3) Save as herein otherwise provided, every corporation and joint stock company, no matter how created or organized, residing or ordinarily resident or carrying on business within the province, shall pay a tax, at the rate applicable thereto set forth in the first schedule to this Act, upon its income during the preceding year.\n(4) Where the commissioner is unable to determine or to obtain the information required to ascertain the income within the province of any corporation or joint stock company or of any class of corporations or joint stock companies, the Lieutenant-Governor in Council may, on the recommendation of the commissioner, make regulations for determining such income within the province or may fix or determine the tax to be paid by a corporation or joint stock company liable to taxation. 1932, c. 9, s. 7; 1934-35, c. 16, ss. 6 and 12; amended. These provisions must be read with section 23 of the Act which provides:\nThe income liable to taxation under this Act of every person residing outside of Saskatchewan, who is carrying on business in Saskatchewan, either directly or through or in the name of any other person, shall be the net profit or gain arising from the business of such person in Saskatchewan. 1932, c. 9, s. 21a.\nUnder a provision in the 1932 Act, corresponding to subsection 4 of section 9, the Lieutenant-Governor in Council passed regulations to provide for determining income as prescribed. These regulations continued in force under the Act of 1936 by virtue of section 40 of the Interpretation Act, chapter 1, R.S.S., 1930, which is as follows:\nWhenever an Act is repealed wholly or in part and other provisions are substituted, all by-laws, orders, regulations and rules made under the repealed Act shall continue good and valid in so far as they are not inconsistent with the substituted Act, enactment or provision until they are annulled or others made in their stead.\nThe regulations are as follows:\n1. Interest, dividends, rents and royalties less their proportionate share of deductions allowed shall be separately determined or ascertained, and if they are received in connection with the trade or business of the taxpayer in the Province, shall be income liable to taxation.\n2. The income referred to in regulation 1 having been separately determined and ascertained, the remainder of the income of the taxpayer liable to taxation shall be taken to be such percentage of the remainder of the income as the sales within the Province bear to the total sales.\nThe sales of the taxpayer shall be measured by the gross amount which the taxpayer has received during the preceding year from sales and other sources in connection with the said business, excluding, however, receipts from the sale or exchange of capital, assets and property not sold in the regular course of business and also receipts from interest, dividends, rents and royalties the income of which has been separately determined or ascertained under the provisions of regulation 1.\n3. If for any reason the portion of income attributable to business within the Province cannot be determined under the provisions of regulation 2, the income referred to in regulation 1 shall first be separately ascertained or determined and for the purpose of ascertaining or determining the proportion of the remainder of the income of the taxpayer, such remainder of income shall be specifically allocated or apportioned within and without the Province by the Commissioner.\n4. If a taxpayer believes that the method of allocation and apportionment herein prescribed or as determined land as applied to his business, has operated or will so operate as to subject him to taxation on a greater portion of his income than is reasonably attributable to business or sources within the Province, he shall be entitled to file with the Commissioner a statement of his objections and of such alternative method of allocation and apportionment as he believes to be proper under the circumstances, with such details and proof and within such time as the Commissioner may reasonably prescribe, and if the Commissioner shall conclude that the method of allocation and apportionment heretofore employed is in fact not applicable or equitable, he shall re-determine the taxable income by such other method of allocation and apportionment as seems best calculated to assign to the Province for taxation the portion of the income reasonably attributable to business and sources within the Province.\n5. These regulations shall not be applied to determine the income* within the Province of a corporation or joint stock company carrying on a trade or business within and without the Province where\n(a) the method or system of accounting used by the taxpayer enables the Commissioner to determine or to obtain the information required to ascertain the income of the taxpayer liable to taxation.\n(b) the income of the taxpayer liable to taxation can be determined or ascertained by allowing the exemption provided by paragraph (m) of section 4 of the Income Tax Act, 1932:\nThe Commissioner in making his assessments applied Regulations 1, 2 and 3.\nThe appellant company did not take advantage of the provisions of Regulation No. 4 and, instead, appealed to the Board of Revenue Commissioners, a body created under the authority of the Treasury Department Act, as amended by chapter 6 of 1934-1935. Under this statute the Board was given power to hear appeals respecting the payment of taxes or other moneys due to the Crown and \"its decisions thereon shall be final and not subject to further appeal unless otherwise provided for in any revenue Act.\" The Board had power to adjudicate on facts as well as on law.\nOn the hearing before the Board, the appellants presented an alternative method of allocation of income and in support of their case, evidence was adduced and heard by the Board. In a very fully considered judgment the Board confirmed the assessments made by the Commissioner of Income Tax.\nThere was no claim put forward for deduction on account of payment to another province, as provided for in section 7 of the Act which reads:\n7. (1) A taxpayer shall be entitled to deduct from the amount of tax which would otherwise be payable under this Act, the amount paid to any other province for income tax in respect of the income of the taxpayer derived from sources therein, if such province allows a similar credit to persons in receipt of income derived from sources within Saskatchewan. (2) The deduction shall not at any time exceed the amount of tax which would otherwise be payable under this Act in respect of the said income derived from sources within such other province.\n(3) A deduction shall be allowed only if the taxpayer furnishes evidence, satisfactory to the commissioner, showing the amount of tax paid and the particulars of income derived from sources within that province. 1933, c. 9, s. 4; 1934-35, c. 16, s. 12.\nIt should be said, however, that it does not appear whether in this case such a claim was available.\nOn a further appeal to Mr. Justice Anderson, who had jurisdiction to consider facts as well as law, the appellants' appeal was again dismissed. And on a further appeal to the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan, which court had jurisdiction only in questions of law and not of fact, the appellants' appeal was again dismissed on this question, although allowed in respect of an allowance for bad debts.\nBefore this Court a question was raised as to the power of the Legislature to pass the Income Tax Act, particularly section 9 (4). The contention of counsel for the appellants, as I understood it, was that if subsection 4 was so construed as to authorize the inclusion in the amount assumed to be earnings of a particular sum which might be considered as an external earning, then the subsection was invalid.\nThere can be no doubt about the power of the Legislature to impose a tax on a company found doing business within the Province. That was settled in the case of Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[13], and I think it follows that the Legislature in settling the income tax may adopt any yardstick which they may deem suitable, providing, of course, the tax is being levied \"in order to the raising of a revenue for provincial purposes\" and not done to achieve any ulterior purpose beyond the proper legislative jurisdiction of the Province: see Bank of Toronto v. Lambe13 (supra), and Attorney-General for Alberta v. Attorney-General for Canada[14], referring particularly to the judgment dealing with the taxation of banks.\nNext it was argued that the regulations are ultra vires of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council.\nUnder section 9 (4) the regulations apply only when the Commissioner is unable to determine or obtain the information required to ascertain the income within the Province. Therefore, the amount to be fixed under subsection 4 must normally be an assumed amount, to take the place of a figure which it is impossible to ascertain. For the purpose of fixing this assumed or estimated amount, the Lieutenant-Governor in Council is authorized to make regulations or to themselves fix or determine the tax.\nThe regulations first provide a general formula which would, no doubt, apply without objection to a very large number of cases but, recognizing that it might work hardship in some cases, provision was made in Regulation 4, enabling the taxpayer to present his objections and any alternative method of allocation or apportionment which he believes to be proper under the circumstances. The Commissioner then has the right to determine the taxable income as seems best calculated to assign to the Province for taxation the portion of the income reasonably attributable to business and sources within the Province.\nAfter much consideration, I cannot say that these regulations exceed the power vested in the Lieutenant-Governor in Council under the authority of subsection 4. They seem to me to be generally well calculated to work out equitably the intention of the Legislature. The making of the estimate is not a purely arbitrary act on the part of an official but is open to review by an independent Board and by a Judge of the Court of King's Bench. Procedure somewhat similar to this is found in other jurisdictions, for example, in England: Halsbury's Laws of England, 2nd Edition, vol. 17, page 174:\n360. Where the true profits of a non-resident person chargeable to tax in the name of a resident person cannot be readily ascertained, the Commissioners may charge the non-resident person on a percentage of the turnover of the business done by the non-resident person through or with the resident person.\nThe percentage is determined, having regard to the nature of the business, by the Commissioners by whom the assessment is made, subject, where the assessment is made by the additional Commissioners, to appeal to the General or Special Commissioners, and subject to the right of the resident or non-resident to require the question to be referred to the Board of Referees, whose decision is final.\nIt is further to be noted that the mode of allocation included in the regulations was not new. It had been in force in Saskatchewan for a number of years prior to the assessments in question and prior to the Income Tax Act of 1936. Moreover, it also appears from the statement of the Board of Revenue Commissioners that the appellants themselves in previous years had adopted the mode of allocation prescribed by the regulations.\nThe position of the Board, as I understand it, is this: \"We have investigated the business giving rise to these assessments, we have heard the appellants' evidence, we have considered their own proposed method of allocation and we cannot find that such method would produce a result more reliable than the formula prescribed by the regulations. Under all the circumstances, we doubt if it is possible for anybody to frame a better formula.\"\nOn appeal, Mr. Justice Anderson, who also had jurisdiction to deal with facts, agreed with the Board.\nNow it is claimed that the mode of allocation prescribed in the regulations, in its application to the assessments here, fails to take into account manufacturing profits which may have been earned by the appellants outside of Saskatchewan. This claim was made before the Board and, although it does not seem to have received as much consideration there as it did before us, it was considered by them. Apparently the Board thought that, while it was a factor to be considered, it formed only one of a group of imponderables, incapable of separate evaluation with any degree of certitude.\nThe question then is whether we, a tribunal having jurisdiction only to decide on questions of law, would be justified in setting aside the assessments. I do not think that this should be done unless we can say that no assessment under subsection 4 of section 9 is valid, if it can be shown that in any degree earnings outside of Saskatchewan may have been included in the estimate of the total figure deemed to be earnings within the Province. I am not prepared to go that far.\nIf it could be said that the Commissioner and the Board and Mr. Justice Anderson had misconstrued the statute or the regulations, or failed to direct their minds to the questions involved, then the Court would be justified in sending it back for reconsideration. We have no information as to what was considered by the Commissioner, but the judgment of the Board of Revenue Commissioners indicates that the members of that body gave some consideration to all of the arguments and have not necessarily misconstrued either the statute or the regulations. On the other points involved in this appeal, I agree with the conclusions of my brother Rinfret and also with the disposition of the appeal which is proposed by him.\nAppeal allowed in part, with one-half costs of appeal. Cross-appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Thorn, Bastedo, Ward & McDougall.\nSolicitor for the respondents: Alex.

Question of jurisdiction of trial court ought to have been raised as special plea before arraignment.\nThe appellants, charged with conspiracy to commit the crime of stealing, made the option to be tried by a judge, without the intervention of a jury, under the provisions of section 827 of the Criminal Code. But, as such offence was punishable with imprisonment for a period exceeding five years, the Attorney-General could \"require\" that the charge be tried by a jury, under the provisions of subsection 5 of section 825 of the Criminal Code. After the election made by the appellants for a speedy trial, the Attorney-General preferred a bill of indictment over his own signature for a trial before a jury. Such trial took place and the appellants were found guilty. The ground of appeal was that, under section 825 (5) Cr. C, there must be a definite statement in writing by the Attorney-General that he \" required\" that the charge be tried by a jury and that the mere signature of the Attorney-General on a bill of indictment did not constitute sufficient compliance with that section.\nHeld that the preferment of a bill of indictment by the Attorney-General over his own signature for a trial before a jury was a sufficient compliance with section 825 (5) of the Criminal Code. There are no form or words specified to indicate that the Attorney-General \"requires\" the charge to be tried by a jury. In the present case, it must be assumed that the Attorney-General had knowledge of the facts in respect to the election made by the appellants, which were of public record, and that, when he intervened by preferring an indictment over his own signature for trial before a jury, he did so for the purpose of complying with section 825 (5) Cr. C. and of exercising the right conferred upon him by that section. Moreover, it is no longer open to the appellants to question before this Court the jurisdiction of the trial court; that was a matter for special plea before arraignment and before pleading the general issue. The appellants, by not having raised then the question of jurisdiction, have waived any right to put forward such a contention, even if the preferment under the signature of the Attorney-General had not been otherwise sufficient and effective under section 825 (5) Cr. C.\nMinguy v. The King (61 Can. S.C.R. 263); Collins v. The King (62 Can. S.C.R. 154), and Giroux v. The King (56 Can. S.C.R. 63) discussed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia affirming the conviction of the appellants on a charge of conspiracy to steal, after trial by a jury.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nR. A. Hughes for the appellant.\nW. L. Scott K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRINFRET J.\u2014In this case, the appellants had made the option to be tried by a judge, without the intervention of a jury (s. 827 Cr. C.). But, as the offence charged was punishable with imprisonment for a period exceeding five years, the Attorney-General could require that the charge be tried by a jury, notwithstanding the consent of the appellants to be tried by a judge alone (s. 825, ss. 5 Cr. C.): \"Thereupon,\" so it is enacted, \" the judge shall have no jurisdiction to try or sentence the accused under this Part\" (i.e., under Part XVIII, Speedy trial of indictable offences).\nAfter the election made by the appellants for a speedy trial, the Attorney-General preferred a bill of indictment over his own signature for trial before a jury.\nThe question is whether this was a sufficient compliance with s. 825 (5) of the Criminal Code.\nIn the Court of Appeal, the Chief Justice of British Columbia decided that it was sufficient, and McQuarrie and McDonald JJ.AA. agreed with him, thus forming the majority of the Court. Sloan and O'Halloran JJ.AA. dissented.\nIt was argued before us that the form in which the indictment was signed by the Attorney-General was nothing more than the form adopted under the practice in British Columbia, where the indictment is usually preferred by the Attorney-General; and it was said that the appellants could not be deprived of the benefit of the election they had made, except by a requirement couched by the Attorney-General in terms which unmistakably implied action under subs. 5 of s. 825 Cr. C.\nIt so happens that this Court has not so far given a final decision on the point so raised. In Minguy v. The King[1], the indictment had been signed by the Crown Prosecutors on behalf of the Attorney-General, but in addition to this the indictment carried the following endorsement:\nLe pr\u00e9sent acte d'accusation (indictment) est port\u00e9 devant le grand jury par ordre du soussign\u00e9 procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la province de Qu\u00e9bec.\n(Sign\u00e9) L. A. Taschereau,\nProc. G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la prov. de Qu\u00e9bec.\nSir Louis Davies C.J. and Duff J., as he then was, held that the \"requirement\" signed by the Attorney-General was in compliance with section 825 Cr. C. Of the other members of the Court, Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ. did not find it necessary to decide the point, because they were of opinion that the election for a speedy trial made by the accused before a District Magistrate was not valid. Idington J. dissented on the ground that the election made by the accused was valid and \"any irregularity could not affect the appellant's right.\" There was, therefore, no majority decision on the question whether the endorsement signed by the Attorney-General of Quebec in the form above reproduced could be held to comply with sec. 825 (5) Cr. C., the appeal having been dismissed on a different point in respect to which the majority of the Court was in agreement.\nIn Collins v. The King[2], the accused was held not to have elected for a speedy trial. The indictment was preferred before the Grand Jury by the Crown Attorneys, who had signed it in the following way: L. A. Taschereau, by Aim\u00e9 Marchand, Lucien Cannon, duly authorized.\nAnd the endorsement found upon it was:\nThis indictment is preferred by the undersigned, the Attorney-General for the Province of Quebec.\nL. A. Taschereau,\nAttorney-General for the Province of Quebec\nDuff J., as he then was, and Brodeur J. held that the right of the appellant to elect to be tried summarily had been taken away by the \" requirement\" made by the Attorney-General for a jury trial, the preferment of the indictment by the Attorney-General under s. 873 Cr. C. constituting such requirement within the meaning of sec. 825 (5) Cr. C. But Idington J. was of the opinion that the accused, having previously renounced any desire for a speedy trial and having later pleaded to the indictment without raising any objection, had waived any right he had for a speedy trial. Anglin and Mignault JJ. found that the application made on behalf of the accused for a postponement of the trial to permit him to re-elect was not an election for a speedy trial. In the result, the appeal was dismissed, but as will be seen, again there was no majority decision on the point whether the preferment of the indictment in the form above stated was a sufficient compliance with sec. 825 (5) Cr. C.\nIn the Collins case[3], however, there are to be noted the following statements made by the respective members of the Court:\nBy Idington J.:\nThe accused, having been charged before the magistrate, expressly renounced any desire for speedy trial without jury and later notwithstanding pleaded to the indictment without raising any sort of objection thereto, in my opinion, had waived any legal right he had up to that time to elect for a speedy trial.\nHe further referred to Giroux v. The King[4], another decision of this Court, where Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. observed (p. 67):\nTo sum up. Both courts had jurisdiction to try the offence. Assuming that the prisoner had by his plea to the indictment selected his forum and acquired the right to be tried by a jury, it was open to him to waive that choice and he was free to forego the privilege of a trial by a jury. Consent cannot confer jurisdiction, but a privilege defeating jurisdiction may always be waived if the trial court has jurisdiction over the subjectmatter. I venture to say that to set aside the proceedings below would in the circumstances of this case amount to a travesty of justice.\nReverting to the Collins case[5], the present Chief Justice of this Court said:\nIn Minguy v. The King[6], I concurred in the opinion of the Chief Justice of this Court that where the Attorney-General prefers a bill of indictment under sec. 873 or where the bill of indictment is, by the special direction of the Attorney-General, so preferred, that, in itself, constitutes a requirement that the case should be tried by a jury within the meaning of section 825, ss. 5.\nI am not at all impressed by the argument that the power given by section 873 is a different power from that given by ss. 5 of sec. 825. They are not the same power, no doubt; but it does not follow that each must be exercised by an independent proceeding. A proceeding under sec. 873 may and prima facie does import a determination that the accused shall be tried by jury, a determination negativing his right to be tried without a jury and at all events, in the absence of some qualifying declarations, it is an exercise of the authority given by sec. 825, ss. 5.\nBrodeur J., in the same case, said (p. 163):\nII me semble que la signature du procureur-g\u00e9n\u00e9ral sur l'acte d'accusation constitue cette demande dont parle l'article 825-5 du code criminel. Je serais enclin \u00e2 croire d'un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9 \u00e9galement que du moment que le procureur-g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, sous l'article 873, porte devant le grand jury une accusation, qu'il y ait eu enqu\u00e9te pr\u00e9liminaire ou non, d\u00e8s ce moment l\u00e1 la cour du Banc du Roi est d\u00fbment saisie de la cause et qu'elle peut la juger et en disposer. Nous n'avons pas \u00e0 examiner ce qui s'est pass\u00e9 anterieurement; et si l'accus\u00e9, comme il l'a fait dans le cas actuel, demande un proc\u00e8s exp\u00e9ditif, la cour a parfaitement le droit de lui refuser ce privil\u00e8ge et de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 faire juger la cause par un jury.\nDans le cas actuel, je consid\u00e8re que l'action du procureur-g\u00e9n\u00e9ral en signant lui-m\u00eame l'acte d'accusation d\u00e9montre d'une mani\u00e8re explicite qu'il requ\u00e9rait que la cause f\u00fbt jug\u00e9e par un jury.\nIt is to be further noted that Mr. Justice Brodeur was one of the judges who sat in the Minguy case[7], and it follows that if he had found himself called upon to decide that case on the question whether the requirement there signed by the Attorney-General was in compliance with section 825, he would evidently have come to the same conclusion as that reached by him in the Collins case[8], which would have meant a majority decision on that point in the Minguy case[9].\nIt will, therefore, appear from the several pronouncements made in this Court on the matter under discussion that, so far, three judges: Sir Louis Davies C.J., the present Chief Justice, and Brodeur J., have expressed the opinion that the endorsement signed by the Attorney-General in Minguy[10] and in Collins[11] was a sufficient requirement that the charge be tried by a jury; and no contrary opinion has been, so far, expressed by any judge in this Court; in each instance, the judges who took part in the decisions having proceeded upon different grounds.\nAs stated by the Chief Justice of British Columbia, no form or words are specified to indicate that the Attorney-General requires the charge to be tried by a jury.\nIn the present case, it must be assumed that the Attorney-General had knowledge of the facts in respect to the election made by the appellants, which were of public record, and that, when he intervened by preferring an indictment over his own signature for trial before a jury, he did so for the purpose of complying with sec. 825 (5) Cr. C. and of exercising the right conferred upon him by that section.\nWe can see no distinction in the pertinent sense between the endorsements signed by the Attorney-General in the cases of Minguy[12] and of Collins[13], and the indictment preferred by the Attorney-General in the present case under his own signature.\nMoreover, it is not open to the appellants now to question the jurisdiction of the trial court. That was a matter for special plea before arraignment and before pleading the general issue (The King v. Komiensky No. 1[14]; Rex v. County Judge's Criminal Court, Re Walsh[15]; Rex v. Selock[16], in the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta).\nHere, the trial court had jurisdiction over the subject-matter. The preferment of the indictment under the signature of the Attorney-General was effective for the purpose of requiring that the charge be tried by a jury; and it did, in fact, bring the charge before the jury. At the opening of the trial at the Assize Court, the accused, assisted by counsel, stood mute, pleaded upon the arraignment, went to trial, examined and cross-examined witnesses, called their defence and addressed the jury. They were content to raise no question of jurisdiction, but rather permit the trial to take its course, in the hope that the jury might acquit them; but since the jury did not do so, they now say that the Court had no jurisdiction, and they ask to be sent to another court in order that they may have another opportunity of being acquitted. We are of opinion that, by what they did, they have waived any right to put forward such a contention, even if the preferment under the signature of the Attorney-General had not been otherwise sufficient and effective under sec. 825 Cr. C. This is not a case of a consent conferring jurisdiction upon a court which otherwise has not jurisdiction. In the words of Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. in the Giroux case (1): It is merely the waiver of a privilege which might have defeated the jurisdiction of the trial court which had jurisdiction over the subject-matter. As stated in the judgment of the Privy Council in Nadan v. The King (2),\nThere can be here no possible question of a disregard of the forms of legal process or the violation of any principle of natural justice.\nFor these reasons, the appeals are dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed.\n[1] (1920) 61 Can.

The wife kept the bank book and she alone drew on the account during her lifetime. A short time before her death when leaving for the hospital the wife handed the bank book to her husband saying \"This is yours.\" The Registrar of Probate held that the money standing to the credit of the joint account at the time of the death of the wife intestate was vested in the husband (now appellant) as his own property, but this judgment was reversed by the appellate court on the appeal of the wife's sister (now respondent), where it was held that the husband, who had been duly appointed administrator of the estate, must render account and that the Registrar of Probate must accordingly add the amount to the inventory of the estate.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco (15 M.P.R. 169), Davis and Hudson JJ. dissenting, that, neither the agreement nor the evidence indicated any intention on the part of the wife to create a joint tenancy, in the money deposited, in favour of her husband.\nPer Crocket, Kerwin and Taschereau JJ.\u2014There is a legal presumption that, when the wife opened the deposit account in the names of her husband and herself and signed the agreement with the bank, there was no intention on her part to divest herself of her exclusive ownership and control of the deposit money and make her husband a joint tenant thereof. This presumption is a rebuttable presumption, which may always be overborne by the owner's previous or contemporaneous oral statements or any other relevant facts or circumstances from which his or her real purpose in making the investment or opening the account in that form may reasonably be inferred to have been otherwise. In the absence, however, of any such evidence to the contrary the presumption of law must prevail. In the present case, such evidence cannot be found to have been established from the only two sources available, viz.: the signed bank deposit agreement form and the appellant's own deposition before the Registrar of Probate.\nPer Davis J. dissenting\u2014The document signed by the wife and her husband cannot be treated merely as a direction to the bank to pay but it evidences an agreement between them and must be construed as evidencing the creation of a joint estate in the moneys in her husband. It is quite impossible to hold on the document that the wife merely created a trust in her husband resulting to her own benefit and did not create, or intend to create, a present joint interest in the moneys in him. Therefore, the husband as survivor was entitled in his own right to what remained in the account on the death of his wife.\nPer Hudson J. dissenting\u2014If the agreement were taken by itself and without extrinsic evidence, the deposit of moneys in the bank must be treated as a joint one to which the survivor was entitled; and the evidence does not contradict such interpretation.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco[1], reversing the decision of the Registrar of Probate for the county of Lunenburg, the appeal to the appellate court having been brought direct to that court by consent of parties and special order.\nThe matter in controversy arises in connection with a joint account in the Bank of Nova Scotia at Caledonia, N.S., in the name of the deceased, Hannah Mailman, and her husband, the present appellant, George Mailman. The deceased died intestate and administration was granted by the Court of Probate to her husband. The husband appeared before that court on April 20th, 1939, on the return of a citation for the closing of the estate. The inventory, for which he proposed to account, showed only bills receivable $33.70 and personal property $46. It appeared from the evidence that there was, at the time of the death of Hannah Mailman, the joint account above referred to amounting to approximately $5,000. One Mary Veniot, one of the next of kin, the present respondent, claimed that the amount of this joint account should be added to the inventory and accounted for by the administrator as part of the estate of the deceased. The Registrar of Probate decided against this contention, and his decision was reversed on appeal.\nV. L. Pearson and J. L. Kemp for the appellant.\nC. R. Coughlan for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Crocket, Kerwin and Taschereau JJ. was delivered by\nCrocket J.\u2014The appellant, George B. Mailman, and the deceased, both of whom the appellant's factum states were elderly people at the time, were married on October 27th, 1934. On September 30th, 1935, Mrs. Mailman, accompanied by her husband, opened a joint account in the Caledonia, N.S., branch of the Bank of Nova Scotia, in the name of herself and her husband with a deposit of $5,118.40, which admittedly belonged to her. Upon making this deposit they both signed a printed joint deposit account agreement form, as required by the bank on the opening of such an account. This agreement was as follows:\nAgreement\nJoint Deposit Accounts\nTo the Bank of Nova Scotia,\nCaledonia, Queens Co., N.S.\nThe undersigned, having opened a deposit account with you in their joint names, hereby agree with you and with each other that, except only in the case of some other lawful claim before repayment, all moneys from time to time deposited to the said account and interest, may be withdrawn by any one of the undersigned, or his or her attorney or agent, and each of the undersigned hereby irrevocably authorizes the said bank to accept from time to time as a sufficient acquittance for any amounts withdrawn from said account, any receipt, cheque, or other document signed by any one of the undersigned, his or her agent, without any further signature or consent.\nThe death of one or more of the undersigned shall in no way affect the right of the survivors, or any one of them, to withdraw all moneys deposited in the said account, as aforesaid.\nDated at Caledonia, Queens Co., N.S., this 30th day of September, 1935.\nWitness (es)\nL. G. Irving Hannah Mailman.\nL. G. Irving George B. Mailman.\nIn October, 1936, Mrs. Mailman suffered an illness, which necessitated her removal from her home to an hospital. She died intestate on May 22nd, 1937, leaving surviving her besides her husband as her next of kin one sister and five brothers. At the time of her death, apart from a balance of $4,648.23, which stood to the credit of the joint bank account above mentioned, the only property she owned consisted of some household furniture and personal effects.\nThe appellant made no application for letters of administration until he was cited by the Probate Court of Lunenburg County on the petition of his deceased wife's surviving sister to show cause why an administrator of the estate should not be appointed, when he filed a petition for his own appointment as such, upon the hearing of which he was appointed administrator of the estate on October 15th, 1938. In his petition for appointment as administrator he alleged that the value of the property, of which the deceased died possessed, was under $400. An inventory filed on October 18th after the appointment of appraisers appraised the entire value of her personal property, including household furniture and effects, wearing apparel and a radio at $46. The dependability of this inventory and appraisement may perhaps best be judged by the fact that the radio, for which the deceased had paid $60 two or three years before, according to the appellant's evidence, was listed at $3, and that, when the intestate's goods and chattels were subsequently sold at public auction they realized $124.85. On April 18th, 1939, the appellant petitioned the Probate Court for the passing of accounts and final settlement of the estate, and after due service of the citation upon the next of kin, a hearing took place before the Registrar of Probate thereupon, at which the deceased's sister was represented by counsel. No other evidence than that of the appellant administrator himself was taken on this hearing. From this it appeared that after his wife's death and months before his appointment as administrator he had paid bills for medical attendance upon his deceased wife, and her hospital and funeral expenses amounting to a little over $200 as well as a bill of $40 for a monument with money withdrawn by him from the joint bank account after the intestate's death; that he himself had drawn, no cheques upon the bank account during his wife's lifetime but that his wife herself had drawn upon it from time to time for household expenses; that when the account was opened at the bank the passbook was given to her and that she retained possession of it until October, 1936, when, just before leaving for the hospital she asked a lady friend to bring it to her, and that afterwards she passed it to him with the remark, \"That is yours.\" He gave no evidence of any conversation between himself and his wife in reference to the opening of the joint bank account, other than the following statements which appear in the Registrar's record of his cross-examination by Mr. Coughlin, counsel for the intestate's sister:\nWhen joint account was opened we talked it over between us and she was agreed. I do not know as I did suggest it. I do not think I did. I am swearing she was the one that suggested opening it at that time. I had a bank account. I did not make it a joint account with my wife * * * I was at bank with wife when she entered the joint account. I knew I could draw money. I could draw money any time. This money in joint account was not in inventory because it was mine * * * Wife was in good health when she gave me the passbook (that was according to his previous statement in October, 1936, just before she was leaving for the hospital). I never saw her in the insane asylum. Heard she was there.\nMr. Coughlan contended that the appellant was not entitled to charge the estate with the bills he had paid before his appointment as administrator for medical services, funeral expenses, etc., and that the balance standing to the credit of the joint bank account at the time of the intestate's death formed part of the intestate's estate and should be added to the inventory. The Registrar rejected both these contentions. With respect to the money standing to the credit of the joint account at the time of the intestate's death, he held that it thereupon vested in the appellant as his own property. The deceased wife's sister appealed from this judgment to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc, which allowed the appeal upon the question of the ownership of the balance standing to the credit of the joint bank account, and held (per Doull, Hall and Graham JJ., Sir Joseph Chisholm C.J. and Archibald J. dissenting), that Mailman must account for this as administrator of his deceased wife's estate. The formal judgment accordingly directed the Registrar of Probate to add the amount thereof to the inventory of the estate.\nIt is from this judgment that Mailman now appeals.\nIt appears from the opposing factums and from both the majority and dissenting judgments in the court below that the appellant there sought to support his claim, not only on the ground that his wife had made him a joint tenant with her of the deposit money by depositing it in the names of both and signing the bank's agreement form on September 30th, 1935, but on the alternative grounds that in October, 1936, she had transferred the whole to him, either as a gift inter vivos or donatio mortis causa, by handing over to him the bank passbook with the remark, \"That is yours\" in the circumstances disclosed in his wholly uncorroborated evidence before the Registrar of Probate. The majority judgment, of course, overruled all these grounds, while the learned Chief Justice in his reasons therefor makes it clear that the dissenting judgment is founded solely on the ground that a joint tenancy was created by the opening of the deposit account and the signing of the bank joint deposit account agreement form on September 30th, 1935, in pursuance of some antecedent oral agreement, which he felt in the circumstances he must assume to have taken place between the two signatories. If this be the correct view and Mrs. Mailman had thus effectually renounced her exclusive ownership of the deposit money at that time, it necessarily negatives the alternative claim that her delivery to her husband more than a year afterwards of the bank passbook in the circumstances alleged constituted either an independent gift inter vivos or a donatio mortis causa of the whole. The one proposition is clearly contradictory of the other in the absence of any evidence from which it could reasonably be inferred that the joint tenancy had in the meantime been revoked and the exclusive ownership of the deposit money revested in Mrs. Mailman, as the learned Chief Justice himself points out. The minority judgment, though distinctly dissenting from the majority judgment on the question of the creation of a joint tenancy, clearly concurs, so far as the alternative grounds are concerned, in the conclusion of the majority judgment that they must fail.\nApart from this, however, the appellant's counsel in his oral argument here did not insist, as he had done in his factum, upon any error in the judgment of the court below as to the insufficiency of the evidence to establish the necessary elements of a valid donatio mortis causa or an effective gift other than that of a joint ownership of the joint deposit account fund. He chose to rely upon the one ground which had been accepted by the minority judgment rather than upon the others which had been unanimously rejected by the court en banc and took the position that the appellant's right on his wife's death to treat the money as his own depended entirely on the construction of the signed bank deposit agreement form, in the light, of course, of the facts disclosed by the parol evidence. This, we think, is the only basis on which the appeal can possibly be supported. It clearly recognizes the deposit agreement as the central feature of the case, upon which the appellant must rely to displace the adverse legal presumption that there was no intention on the part of Mrs. Mailman to divest herself of her exclusive ownership and control of the deposit money and make her husband a joint tenant thereof when she opened the deposit account in the names of both.\nThat both law and equity interpose such a presumption against an intention to create a joint tenancy, except where a father makes an investment or bank deposit in the names of himself and a natural or adopted child or a husband does so in the names of himself and his wife, is now too firmly settled to admit of any controversy. This presumption, of course, is a rebuttable presumption, which may always be overborne by the owner's previous or contemporaneous oral statements or any other relevant facts or circumstances from which his or her real purpose in making the investment or opening the account in that form may reasonably be inferred to have been otherwise. In the absence, however, of any such evidence to the contrary the presumption of law must prevail. That is the clear result of such leading English cases as Dyer v. Dyer[2]; Fowkes v. Pascoe[3]; Marshall v. Crutwell[4]; In re Eykyn's Trusts[5]; Bennet v. Bennet[6], and Standing v. Bowring[7]. This principle has been uniformly recognized in Canada wherever the courts have been required to adjudicate upon claims depending upon the creation of a joint tenancy or gift of a joint interest when the owner of the money involved has made investments or bank deposits in his own and another's names. There have been many such cases, particularly in Ontario and New Brunswick. Some of these involved disputes between the executor or administrator of a deceased father and a surviving son or daughter, and others disputes between the executor or administrator of a deceased husband and his surviving widow, where the presumption is in favour of a joint tenancy or a gift of a joint interest for the benefit of the child or of the wife, as the case may be. The decisions of course have varied according to the facts and circumstances of the particular cases, but it will be found on examination of the various judgments that the courts of both provinces alike in reaching their decisions have never failed to keep in mind the legal presumption and to decide the cases upon the basis of the sufficiency or insufficiency of the evidence to displace such presumption, whether it lies on one side or the other. Perhaps I should refer in this connection to two Ontario cases, viz.: those of Re Hodgson[8] and Re Reid[9], in consequence of the special references made by Middleton J. at pp. 533 and 534 to the English cases of Dyer v. Dyer2; Fowkes v. Pascoe3 and Marshall v. Crutwell4, and those of Meredith C.J. at pp. 598 and 599 to the necessity of such presumption being rebutted and his adoption of the opinion of Cotton L.J. in Standing v. Bowring7; and also to two earlier New Brunswick cases\u2014those of DeBury v. DeBury[10] and Vanwart v. The Diocesan Synod of Fredericton[11], because of Barker J.'s statement of the law in this regard at p. 353 of the former case, as founded upon Drew v. Martin[12]; In re Eykyr\u00ecs Trusts[13], Fowkes v. Pascoe[14], and Marshall v. Crutwell[15], and of McLeod J.'s approaching his consideration of the latter case as well upon the doctrine laid down In re Eykyn's Trusts13, as affirmed by DeBury v. DeBury[16], as will be seen at page 11, and of his reference to Marshall v. Crutwell15 at pp. 15 and 16.\nThe deposit money having admittedly been owned by Mrs. Mailman when it was placed in the joint account, and the presumption of law unquestionably being that she did not intend to create a joint tenancy in favour of her husband, the decisive question is: Is there evidence upon which it can reasonably be held that her intention was other than that which the law presumes it to have been?\nIt is obvious that if there is any such evidence there are but two sources in which it can be sought, viz.: the signed bank deposit agreement form and the appellant's own deposition before the Registrar of Probate.\nAs to the agreement itself, it is to be observed in the first place that it is in the form of a letter addressed to the bank on a closely printed form, which apparently was intended for general use without alteration in the various branches of the bank on the opening of any and every joint deposit account, whether in the name of two or three or more persons and regardless of any private agreement which may have taken place between the parties named in any particular deposit account. It contains no reference, express or implied, to the ownership of the money when deposited or to any previous agreement having been entered into between the parties concerning the opening of the account. It begins merely with the statement that\nThe undersigned, having opened a deposit account with you in their joint names, hereby agree with you and with each other that, etc.\nFor my part I cannot see how these words can be taken as necessarily implying that there was or had been any other agreement with the bank or between the signatories than that which is embodied in the document itself. It does not even indicate the relationship of the parties to the account. Its sole purpose and effect, as I read it, is to authorize the bank to accept from time to time as a sufficient acquittance for any amounts withdrawn from the deposit account any receipt, cheque or document signed by either. That it was intended to have no particular reference to any private arrangement or understanding between the two signatories seems to me to be conclusively shown by the last paragraph, viz.:\nThat the death of one or more of the undersigned shall in no way affect the right of the survivors, or any one of them to withdraw all moneys deposited in said account as aforesaid.\nIt is this particular paragraph upon which the appellant's counsel chiefly relied to support his claim that Mrs. Mailman intended to create a joint tenancy in favour of her husband. It will be noticed, however, that the paragraph merely provides that the death of one of the signatories shall not affect the right of the survivors or any one of them to withdraw the moneys deposited in the account, and that it in no way purports to provide that if and when the surviving signatory does withdraw such moneys he or she shall be deemed to do so as sole owner thereof. It merely preserves the right of either party, in the event of the death of the other, to withdraw all moneys deposited in the account in the same way as he or she might have done during the lifetime of both. No doubt had the letter of instructions to the bank not contained this provision, the appellant's right to withdraw any money from the deposit account would have ended with his wife's death. In that event the bank could not safely have accepted any cheque or order made by the appellant against the deposit moneys in its hands without proof that he was entitled to receive the outstanding balance, either as administrator of his intestate wife's estate or in his own right. That seems to me to be the only consistent explanation of the inclusion in the bank's general printed form of joint deposit account agreements of the particular provision relied on by the appellant, i.e., that it is a provision inserted in all its joint deposit agreements for the bank's own protection and convenience, and having no reference to the rights of the parties named as between themselves other than the right of each to draw upon the deposit account in the manner stated. Looking at the whole agreement form, as signed by Mrs. Mailman and her husband, I cannot see how it can well be regarded as other than a mere compliance with the usual requirements of the bank for the opening of any joint deposit account. Even if one were disposed to regard it as an agreement between the parties themselves as to their respective rights concerning the deposit fund, those rights, as already appears, are definitely restricted to the authority of each to withdraw money from the account in the manner stated in the first paragraph. This does not itself necessarily imply the right of the appellant to take the money as his own. Otherwise there could be no joint bank account to which any presumption of law could apply one way or the other, in view of the fact that such authority to withdraw is a necessary incident of the establishment of every joint bank account. We must take it, I think, to start with at least, that the right to withdraw the money as provided in the first paragraph of this supposed agreement between the parties did not per se create a joint tenancy. If it did not, how can the provision of the last paragraph that the death of one of the signatories shall in no way affect the right of the survivor, or as it puts it, \"the survivors or any one of them,\" to withdraw the money as aforesaid, logically be construed as doing so? Clearly to my mind it leaves the implication precisely where the first paragraph does, so far as Mrs. Mailman's intention to create a joint tenancy is concerned. As Graham J. points out in his judgment in the court en banc, if a joint tenancy had been intended, there was no need of a special provision that the survivor could withdraw the outstanding balance of the joint account in the event of the death of one of the two signatories. That would have followed as a necessary consequence of Mrs. Mailman's death vesting the money in her husband as its sole and absolute owner in virtue of the joint tenancy itself, had she in fact on the opening of the deposit account made him a joint tenant with her. The signed joint bank deposit agreement form, therefore, is no more indicative of Mrs. Mailman's intention to make her husband a joint tenant with her of the deposit moneys than the deposit account itself.\nAs to the parol evidence, it consists entirely, as I have said, of the appellant's own deposition before the Registrar of Probate, which the Registrar himself describes as vague and of little use. All he says in connection with the opening of the account is that when the account was opened we talked it over between us and she was agreed. I do not know as I did suggest it. I don't think I did. I am swearing she was the one who suggested it * * * I know I could draw money. I could draw money any time.\nHe gave no details of any conversation with her either before or at the time the money was deposited, from which any inference could be drawn that she intended to renounce her exclusive ownership of the deposit money and give him such a joint ownership thereof as would entitle him upon her death to take the outstanding balance as her survivor. The most that can be said of this evidence is that he understood from what his wife said when they talked it over that he could draw money from the account any time. It adds nothing in this respect to what the formal bank agreement, which they both signed, itself says. It is true that he later alleged in connection with his wife's handing him the passbook more than a year after the opening of the account:\nIt was for me to take care of me. She used it during her lifetime, and when she was gone I would go and get it.\nThis latter statement apparently was intended as an addition or qualification to his wife's remark, \"That is yours,\" which was so strongly relied upon in the court below in support of the contradictory theory of an intended subsequent gift inter vivos or mortis causa. Even if it were taken as applying to the alleged conversation relating to the opening of the deposit account, the statement that when she was gone \"I would go and get it\" obviously adds nothing to the right to withdraw the money in the event of her death, as provided by the bank's printed agreement form. On the other hand, if his later statement is taken as his understanding of what took place in connection with the alleged delivery of the bank passbook in October, 1936, as I think it must be, it plainly shows that, if his wife more than a year before had really intended to put him in the same position as herself with respect to the ownership of the deposit money, she had forgotten all about it. This evidence and the admitted fact that she kept the passbook in her own possession for a period of more than a year after the opening of the account seems to me to point to but one conclusion, viz.: that, if the appellant himself understood that his wife, when she opened the account, intended to make the fund joint property with right of sole ownership and property to the survivor, she herself had no such understanding or intention. And it is, of course, her intention, and not his understanding, which must be regarded as the determining factor.\nHaving regard to the strikingly vague and equivocal character of the appellant's testimony, and to the admitted fact that at the time of the opening of the joint account in question he had a bank account of his own, which he took care to keep in his own name, I have been unable to find, either in the deposit agreement itself, as I construe it, or in the deposition of the appellant himself any evidence, which can reasonably be held to rebut the presumption of law that Mrs. Mailman had no intention of giving the deposit moneys to her husband to the exclusion of her own next of kin.\nI would therefore dismiss the appeal with costs.\nDavis J. (dissenting)\u2014This appeal arises out of a joint: bank account of husband and wife. The wife died intestate leaving as next of kin her husband and several, brothers and a sister; the husband as survivor of the joint depositors drew out the balance that remained in the bank account at the date of his wife's death and claims the money as his own property; the wife's sister seeks in these proceedings, commenced in the Court of Probate for the County of Lunenburg, in the Province of Nova Scotia, to have the moneys treated as part of the deceased's estate.\nGeorge and Hannah Mailman, apparently middle aged; people, were married on October 27th, 1934. The joint deposit of the moneys was made by them on September 30th, 1935. The wife died on May 22nd, 1937. The amount deposited at the opening of the joint bank account was $5,118.40; at the date of the wife's death there was a balance of $4,648.23. It is admitted that the moneys prior to the joint deposit had been separate estate of the wife and had been on deposit in the same bank to the credit of her personal account. Husband and wife went together to the bank; the wife closed out her private account; and together they deposited the proceeds in a new account\u2014a joint account. Apart from the production of the document, to which I shall presently refer more particularly, which both of them signed at the bank when the joint account was opened, there are really no other material facts disclosed. There is no evidence that the account was opened merely for the convenience of the wife and no evidence that it was in an attempt on the part of the wife to make a testamentary disposition. And it is not the case of a mere deposit receipt or a pass-book entry. Both husband and wife were contracting parties with the bank and they signed a document at the time. That document is evidence of an agreement between them and the proper decision in the case turns upon the terms of that document. It is as follows:\u2014\nAgreement\nJoint Deposit Accounts\nTo the Bank of Nova Scotia,\nCaledonia, Queens Co., N.S.\nThe undersigned, having opened a deposit account with you in their joint names, hereby agree with you and with each other that, except only in the case of some other lawful claim before repayment, all moneys from time to time deposited to the said account and interest, may be withdrawn by any one of the undersigned, or his or her attorney or agent, and each of the undersigned hereby irrevocably authorizes the said Bank to accept from time to time as a sufficient acquittance for any amounts withdrawn from said account, any receipt, cheque or other document signed by any one of the undersigned, his or her agent, without any further signature or consent.\nThe death of one or more of the undersigned shall in no way affect the right of the survivors or any one of them, to withdraw all moneys deposited in the said account, as aforesaid.\nDated at Caledonia, Queens Co., N.S., this 30th day of September, 1935.\nWitness(es)\nL. G. Irving Hannah Mailman.\nL. G. Irving George Mailman.\nIt is to be observed that husband and wife state that they, \"the undersigned,\" have opened a deposit account in their joint names and that they \"hereby agree,\" not only with the Bank, but \"with each other that * * *.\" Further, they agree that the death of one \"shall in no way affect the right of\" the survivor to withdraw all moneys deposited in the said account. The document cannot in my opinion be treated merely as a direction to the Bank to pay.\nIt is not a question of some presumption of law; it is a question of the construction of the document. The document clearly evidences an agreement between the wife and her husband and must be construed, in my opinion, as evidencing the creation of a joint estate in the moneys in her husband. In the face of such a document and in the absence of any other material facts, the source of the money becomes immaterial. I find it quite impossible myself to say on the document that the wife merely created a trust in her husband resulting to her own benefit and did not create, or intend to create, a present joint interest in the moneys in him.\nThe husband as survivor was entitled in his own right to what remained in the account on the death of his wife. I would allow the appeal and restore the decision of the Registrar of Probate, with costs throughout.\nHudson J. (dissenting)\u2014This is a very close case. The Registrar of Probate by whom the case was tried decided that the appellant was entitled to the fund in question.\nOn appeal, Chief Justice Chisholm and Mr. Justice Archibald took the same view, but Doull, Hall and Graham, JJ. took the opposite view, holding that the fund in question should be treated as part of the estate of the deceased Hannah Mailman.\nThe agreement signed when the deposit was made recognizes that the deposit was made by both George Mailman and his wife. It was to be in their joint names and they agreed not only with the bank but with each other that all moneys from time to time deposited in the account might be withdrawn by either one of them and, furthermore, provided that the death of one or more should in no way affect the right of the survivor to withdraw money deposited in this account. If this agreement were taken by itself and without extrinsic evidence, I think that there should be little hesitation in treating the deposit as a joint one to which the survivor was entitled. As stated by Chief Justice Chisholm:\nWhen we turn to the agreement we find it stated by the parties that they have agreed to open the account in their joint names, in other words, a joint account, that either of them might make withdrawals and that the death of one of them should not in any way affect the right of the survivor to withdraw all the moneys remaining on deposit in the account. Does not such an agreement express the purpose of creating a joint ownership? Would not such language satisfy both parties that it sufficiently expressed an intention that there should be joint ownership? The signatories were lay people, not versed in the niceties of exact legal expression, and they would naturally believe that the document expressed the oral agreement which we must assume preceded the signing and was effective to enable the survivor to withdraw the money in the account as his or her own by right of survivorship.\nFrom the evidence it appears that before the money was deposited it belonged to Mrs. Mailman, that no moneys of Mailman himself were deposited in the account and none drawn out by him during the life time of Mrs. Mailman. On the other hand, Mrs. Mailman did draw out various sums herself, but it appears that these sums were drawn out for the purpose of assisting in carrying on the home, that is, for the benefit of both husband and wife. The bank book was held by Mrs. Mailman until a few months before her death when it was handed over to her husband.\nMailman himself had an account in some bank or other in his own name. What this amounted to is not in evidence. Beyond this the evidence adds nothing.\nIt appears that the parties were in modest circumstances and, although there is no presumption in favour of gift by a wife to her husband, it seems to me that the circumstances here do not render a gift of the character recognized by the written agreement improbable or unreasonable.\nThe matter is not at all certain but I incline to the conclusion reached by the Registrar and the minority in the Court of Appeal. I would allow the appeal and restore the Registrant's order.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: V. L. Pearson.\nSolicitor for the respondent: C. R.

W.H. was not in the store at the time, it being in charge of his brother and employee, the defendant F.H. The said C.H. (a nephew of the other defendants but not employed in the store) had been exhibiting the pistol to a customer in the store, charging it with air and discharging it, and, after the infant plaintiff had entered to make a purchase, C.H. exhibited the pistol to him, pointing it towards him and discharging it, when the accident occurred. The trial judge, Urquhart J. ([1940] O.R. 461), held all defendants liable, and awarded $10,000 general damages to the infant plaintiff. His judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal for Ontario (ibid), except that said damages were reduced to $5,000. Defendants appealed; and plaintiffs cross-appealed, asking for restoration of the amount of damages awarded at trial.\nHeld: The appeal and cross-appeal should be dismissed.\nThe trial judge\u2019s finding that C.H. was negligent should not be disturbed, there being ample evidence to warrant it. F.H. (who, on the trial judge\u2019s finding, knew that the pistol was a very dangerous weapon), as the person in charge of the store, who negligently allowed C.H. to remain on the premises in possession of the dangerous article and to use it, must also be held liable. W.H. was the occupier of the store, as he was the proprietor of the business being carried on therein. A customer is entitled to the exercise of reasonable care by the occupier to prevent damage from unusual danger of which the occupier knows or ought to know (Indermaur v. Dames, L.R. 1 C.P. 274). W.H. failed in his duty to the infant plaintiff (who had entered the store as a customer) to exercise that care when his employee, F.H., was guilty of negligence; and must also be held liable. Where general damages fixed by a trial judge sitting without a jury have been reduced by the Court of Appeal under circumstances such as those in the present case, this Court, as a general rule, will not interfere. (Ross v. Dunstall, 62 Can. S.C.R. 393; Pratt v. Beamen, [1930] S.C.R. 284). No error in principle was made by the Court of Appeal. (McHugh v. Union Bank of Canada, [1913] A.C. 299, discussed and distinguished; Warren v. Gray Goose Stage Ltd., [1938] S.C.R. 52, at 57, referred to).\nAPPEAL by the defendants from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] dismissing (but with a reduction of the amount of damages awarded) their appeal from the judgment of Urquhart J.1 in favour of the plaintiffs for damages by reason of an injury suffered by the infant plaintiff.\nThe injury occurred in a store. The defendant William Hanes was the proprietor of the business carried on therein. On the occasion in question he was not in the store, his brother and employee, the defendant Frank Hanes, being in charge of it. The defendant Carl Hanes, a boy 16 years old, who was a nephew of the other defendants and lived with them, but was not employed in the store, had, a few weeks before the accident, purchased an air-pistol, and on the occasion in question he was exhibiting it, charging it with air and discharging it, in the store. He had been thus displaying it to a customer, a girl 13 years old, when the infant plaintiff, a boy 12 years old, entered the store to make a purchase. The defendant Carl Hanes, in exhibiting the pistol to the infant plaintiff, pointed it towards him and pressed the trigger, and a bullet struck the infant plaintiff in the eye, destroying it. It was not known how it happened that the bullet was in the pistol.\nThe trial judge found that the air-pistol was a highly dangerous weapon; that in pointing it at the infant plaintiff, the defendant Carl Hanes was guilty of assault and negligence; that the air\u2011pistol in his hands was an unusual danger in the store; that the defendant Frank Hanes, in charge of the store at the time, knew or should have known of such danger, because he knew that the pistol was a very dangerous weapon, and he owed a duty to the infant plaintiff, a customer in the store, to have seen that the danger was removed; and was liable in negligence for the consequences of allowing the danger to remain upon the premises; that the defendant William Hanes was liable for the negligence of his employee, Frank Hanes; and gave judgment against all the defendants for $10,000 general damages in favour of the infant plaintiff, and $406 damages, for expenses incurred or to be incurred, in favour of his father, the adult plaintiff.\nOn appeal by the defendants, the Court of Appeal for Ontario reduced from $10,000 to $5,000 the amount of damages awarded to the infant plaintiff, but in all other respects dismissed the appeals. Fisher J.A., dissenting, would have allowed the appeals and dismissed the action.\nThe defendants appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada (special leave so to appeal from the judgment in favour of the adult plaintiff was granted by the Court of Appeal for Ontario). There was a cross-appeal asking that the damages fixed by the trial judge should be restored. By the judgment of this Court now reported, the appeals and cross-appeal were dismissed with costs.\nT.F. Forestell K.C. for the appellant Carl Hanes.\nR.B. Law K.C. for the appellants Frank Hanes and William Hanes.\nJ.R. Cartwright K.C. and O.M. Walsh K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nKERWIN J.\u2014The appeals should be dismissed with costs. The trial judge has found that Carl Hanes was negligent. There was ample evidence to warrant this finding and we agree with the Court of Appeal that it cannot be disturbed.\nThe trial judge also found Frank Hanes to have been negligent, as appears from the following extract from his judgment:\u2014\nSo it comes down to this as I see it. William Banes is the owner of the store; Frank Hanes, his brother, was his employee in charge of it that day; the infant defendant was in the store armed with a highly dangerous weapon; both the uncles, particularly Frank Hanes, knew its qualities and propensities and that it was a very dangerous weapon; to the knowledge of Frank Hanes the infant defendant was charging it with air and discharging it in the store; Frank Hanes allowed him to do this and did not see that he did not flourish the weapon around in the store in the direction of customers; he allowed him to remain in the store; the infant plaintiff entered the store as an invitee; the infant defendant charged the pistol with air, cocked it (to say the least), took aim at the infant plaintiff and pressed the trigger, causing serious injury. As the person in charge of the store, who negligently allowed Carl Hanes to remain on the premises in possession of the dangerous article and to use it, Frank Hanes must be held responsible.\nWilliam Hanes was the occupier of the store as he was the proprietor of the business being carried on therein. The infant plaintiff had entered the store as a customer. As pointed out by Willes J. in Indermaur v. Dames[2] a customer is entitled to the exercise of reasonable care by the occupier to prevent damage from unusual danger of which the occupier knows or ought to know. William Hanes failed in his duty to the infant plaintiff to exercise that care when his employee, Frank Hanes, was guilty of negligence, and William Hanes must also be held liable in damages.\nThe trial judge awarded the infant plaintiff ten thousand dollars damages. The Court of Appeal, while agreeing with all the considerations which the trial judge stated moved him to fix that amount, thought there were other matters which had not been sufficiently taken into account by him and reduced the damages to five thousand dollars. The plaintiffs cross\u2011appeal.\nWhere general damages fixed by a trial judge sitting without a jury have been reduced by a Court of Appeal under circumstances such as we find here, this Court, as a general rule, will not interfere: Ross v. Dunstall[3]; Pratt v. Beaman[4]. Mr. Cartwright referred to McHugh v. Union Bank of Canada[5]. That, however, was a case where the Court of Appeal of Alberta determined that there was no evidence upon which the trial judge could assess damages but granted the plaintiff the option to have the matter referred to the Clerk of the Court to take an account of what damages, if any, the plaintiff had suffered by the negligence of the defendants but gave directions which would limit such damages. That decision was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada with an alteration in the direction as to the method of assessment. The Judicial Committee, agreeing with the minority opinion that had been expressed in this Court, decided (p. 309) that there was evidence to warrant a determination by the trial judge as to the quantum of damages and that there was nothing to justify a conclusion that his assessment was erroneous. I think there was nothing more involved in that decision on the question of damages, and the judgment delivered on behalf of the majority of this Court in Warren v. Gray Goose Stage Ltd.[6] does not indicate that any wider construction was put by them upon the words of their Lordships in the McHugh case[7].

J. Spector for the appellants.\nHenry Weinfield K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014In the writ of summons, the appellants are described as follows:\nThe International Ladies Workers Union and the Dress Makers Union Local 262 of the said International Ladies Garment Workers Union and The Dress Cutters Union Local 205 of the said International Ladies Garment Workers Union, all of the city and district of Montreal, and being voluntary associations consisting of groups of persons associated for the carrying out in common in the city and district of Montreal, of purposes and advantages of an industrial nature and not possessing in the province of Quebec a collective civil personality recognized by law and not being partnerships within the meaning of the Civil Code but competent to ester en justice in virtue of the Act to facilitate the Exercise of Certain Rights, 2 Geo. VI, statutes of Quebec, chapter 96.\nThe appellants joined with seventy-six individual plaintiffs in an action whereby, praying act of their readiness and willingness to fulfill their obligations and to continue at all times in the employment of the respondent upon the rates of salary and the terms and conditions provided for in four agreements between The Montreal Dress Manufacturing Guild, the International Ladies Garment Union and the Dressmakers Union Local 262, or with the Dress Cutters Union Local 205, and for the term therein stipulated, they prayed that judgment be rendered against the respondent in the sum of $122,360, payable to the individual plaintiffs respectively in divers sums therein mentioned; under reserve of all other rights of the plaintiffs, and especially without prejudice to the plaintiffs' rights to seek an injunction restraining the respondent from further violation of the said agreements, and without prejudice to such other employees of the respondent who have not been joined in the present suit, or without prejudice to their rights to take individual suits, if they so desire; and, further, and, in so far as it may be necessary at law, that the said agreements be declared resiliated and set aside and be annulled \"\u00e0 toutes fins que de droit\" as regards the plaintiffs and the respondent herein; and that the mis-en-cause be summoned \"pour voir dire et d\u00e9clarer,\" in so far as its rights are affected and without prejudice to the rights of the plaintiffs against any other member of the said \"mis-en-cause\" other than the respondent, the whole with costs against the respondent, and without costs for the mis-en-cause, unless it contests.\nThe action, in so far as the appellants were concerned, was met by an exception to the form alleging that the statute of Quebec 2 Geo. VI, c. 96, invoked by the appellants, did not confer on them the right to sue as in the present action, that they were not legal personalities having in law the capacity to institute actions before the courts of the province of Quebec; and that the action should be dismissed with regard to the three appellants.\nThe Superior Court (Fabre Surveyer J.) maintained the exception to the form.\nThe Court of King's Bench (appeal side) unanimously confirmed that judgment.\nThe appellants appealed to this Court and were met by a motion to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction.\nThe motion was adjourned so as to be considered together with the merits of the appeal; and, having heard the appeal, we are of opinion that it should be dismissed, but that the motion to quash should also be dismissed.\nThe jurisdiction of this Court depends upon the nature and the conclusions of the action. These conclusions, amongst other things, pray for the resiliation, the setting aside and the annulment of four agreements one of the effects of which is that the seventy-six plaintiffs ask the payment to them of a sum of $122,360; and they further pray for an injunction restraining the respondent from further violating, so it is alleged, the agreements in question. Under the circumstances, the jurisdiction of this Court is clear; and the motion to quash should be dismissed with costs against the respondent.\nAs for the merits involved in the appeal, our starting point must be the judgment of this Court in Society Brand Clothes Limited v. Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America[2].\nIn that case, the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, having its principal place of business in the city of New York, was described in the proceedings as \"an unincorporated association\"; the other respondents were also described as unincorporated bodies having their head offices and principal place of business in the city of Montreal. They were defendants in the case, had filed an appearance by counsel and had pleaded to the merits of the action. At the trial, counsel for the respondents raised orally for the first time the point that, not being legal entities, they were not suable. It was held that they could not be legally sued. Mr. Justice Cannon, delivering the judgment of the majority of the Court, stated that\nan unincorporated labour union has no legal existence and cannot be considered in law as an entity distinct from its individual members and is not suable in the common name.\nThe Court should proprio motu take notice that an aggregate voluntary body, though having a name, cannot appear in court as a corporation when, in reality, it is not incorporated. A body such as this is not, according to law, a judicial person in the pertinent sense.\nAs a consequence, this Court decided that these bodies could not as such appear before the courts and that their officers had no capacity to represent them before the tribunals of the province of Quebec where \"nul ne plaide au nom d'autrui.\" (C.C.P. art 81.)\nThat judgment was delivered in this Court on December 23rd, 1930; and our inquiry, therefore, may be limited to the question whether, since then, the province of Quebec has legislated to give legal existence to, or recourse against, these unincorporated bodies in such a way that they may be regarded as entities distinct from their individual members, and as having the right to ester en justice.\nIt will be remembered that, in the writ of summons, the appellants claimed to be authorized in that respect in virtue of the Act to facilitate the exercise of certain rights, being chapter 96 of the statute of Quebec, 2 Geo. VI, assented to on April 12th, 1938; and, in their factum, the appellants stated that\nthe issue resolves itself into an interpretation of that statute * * * and to a definition of the capacity of the appellant-Unions in the light of such statute.\nBut they also referred to the\ncollateral and ancillary legislation enacted in connection with industrial and labour matters in the province of Quebec since 1930.\nIt should not be denied that this is a matter of prime importance, affecting as it does the power of organized labour to come into court in order to maintain their rights before the tribunals of the province of Quebec.\nIt was stated in this Court that the pith and substance of the appeal consisted in the decision of the question whether or not the right to sue is co-relative, reciprocal and complementary with the right to be sued, so far as concerns the appellants; and whether these groups of persons, associated for the carrying on of their common purposes, were endowed with sufficient capacity to ester en justice \"en demandant\" as well as \"en d\u00e9fendant.\"\nThe statute 2 Geo. VI, c. 96, is as follows:\n1. Every group of persons associated for the carrying out in common of any purpose or advantage of an industrial, commercial or professional nature in this province, which does not possess therein a collective civil personality recognized by law and is not a partnership within the meaning of the Civil Code, is subjected to the provisions of section 2 of this Act.\n2. The summoning of such group before the courts of this province, in any recourse provided by the laws of the province, may be effected by summoning one of the officers thereof at the ordinary or recognized office of such group or by summoning such group collectively under the name by which it designates itself or is commonly designated or known.\nThe summoning by either method contemplated in the precedent paragraph, shall avail against all the members of such group and the judgments rendered in the cause may be executed against all the moveable or immoveable property of such group.\nThe appellants contended that, since a group may be summoned collectively as defendant under the name by which it designates itself, it may likewise bring suit under that name. We agree with the learned trial judge and with the Court of King's Bench that such interpretation is contrary to the text of the statute. The words are precise and unambiguous, and they must be read in their ordinary and natural sense (Salomon v. Salomon[3]).\nThat statute allows the summoning of groups of the nature of the appellants before the courts of the province of Quebec, either by summoning one of their officers, or by summoning the group collectively under the name by which it is designated; but it does not permit them to bring an action before the courts. The word \"summoning\" is well known in the procedure of the province and it connotes the manner in which an action at law is brought against a defendant. The enactment is couched in express terms and does not admit of any possible doubt.\nIndeed, it may be said that the very wording of the statute implies that, up to its adoption by the Legislature, groups like the appellants could not be summoned or sued before the courts in the province of Quebec, that, henceforth, actions may be instituted against them under the name by which they designate themselves; but the wording excludes the capacity for these groups to enter actions into court in that name on their own behalf (Inclusio unius fit exclusio alterius).\nPrior to the enactment of the statute in question, trade unions, associations, or groups of persons envisaged by this statute were immune from legal proceedings as associations or groups. In order to bring action against them as defendants, it was necessary to implead every member of such association or group.\nIt was evidently to remedy that situation and, no doubt, as a consequence of the decisions of the courts on this point, to enable the practical exercise of legal recourse against the unincorporated bodies, that the statute in question was enacted.\nThe statute does not purport to incorporate the groups or persons therein described, nor does it purport to confer upon them a collective legal personality. It does exclusively what is therein stated: It allows persons who have claims against them to summon them in the name of one of the officers thereof, at the ordinary or recognized office of the group, or collectively under the name by which they are commonly designated or known.\nThe appellants might have acquired the necessary status as an association or professional syndicate under a Quebec statute known as The Professional Syndicate Act, ch. 255, R.S.Q., 1925; or, by registering in accordance with the provisions of the Trade Unions Act of Canada (R.S.C., 1927, c. 202), the members of the appellant trade unions might have acquired certain legal capacity and legal existence, in the name of such unions, within the limits of the last mentioned Act.\nThe appellants have not availed themselves of either enactment. And while they are invoking only the statute 2 Geo. VI, c. 96, they are subject to the provisions of s. 2 of that statute; and the consequence is that they may be sued in their collective name, but they are not authorized to sue as a group and in that name.\nThe appellants have referred the Court to an Act respecting Limiting of Working Hours (Statute of Quebec 23 Geo. V, c. 40), the Collective Labour Agreement Extension Act (24-25 Geo. V, c. 56), replaced by The Collective Labour Agreements Act (1 Geo. VI, c. 49) amended by 2 Geo. VI, c. 52, and replaced by The Collective Agreement Act (4 Geo. VI, c. 38), assented to on June 22nd, 1940.\nThey have also turned our attention to The Fair Wage Act (1 Geo. VI, c. 50), replacing The Women's Minimum Wage Act, and in turn replaced by the Minimum Wage Act (4 Geo. VI, c. 39).\nUnder sec. 7 of the Collective Agreements Extension Act (24 Geo. V, c. 56), it was provided that parties to a collective labour agreement should form a joint committee charged with the supervising and assuring the carrying out of such agreements and this joint committee, through its delegates, was entitled.\nto exercise for the benefit of each of the employees all rights of action arising in their favour from a collective agreement made obligatory, without having to prove an assignment of claim from the person concerned.\nAnd by subs. 4 of s. 7, it was enacted that\nthe joint committee formed under the Act shall constitute a corporation and shall possess the powers of an ordinary corporation for the carrying out of this Act. Similar provisions were carried through the subsequent Acts; but it will be noticed that the juridical personality, in the contemplation of the law, was given, not to the union, association or group of persons, but to the joint committee formed under the Acts. These several statutes are not susceptible of a construction favourable to the appellants' contention. None of them has the effect of qualifying the clear and express meaning of the statute of 1938 (2 Geo. VI, c. 96); and not only can it be said that, in making a union capable of being summoned as defendant in a law suit, the Legislature has not endowed it with all inherent, ancillary and supplementary powers enabling it to initiate an action at law; but the contrary intention of the Legislature evidently appears from the very wording of the enactment.\nThe question whether the appellant unions are proper and necessary parties in the present case has nothing to do with the point now under discussion. On the respondent's exception to the form, we are concerned exclusively with the question whether they could be made plaintiffs in the case in the name by which they are designated or commonly known\u2014and nothing more. The appellants are not denied the right to institute proceedings; still less, as suggested by the appellants, are they denied their day in court. This judgment is not intended to go any further than to say that they could not institute the present proceedings and become plaintiffs in the case merely by designating themselves in the writ of summons under the name which they have adopted in the premises.\nUnder the circumstances, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nWe do not think the Court of King's Bench was in error in granting costs of appeal against the appellants. In the Society Brand case[4], the appeal was dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Bercovitch & Spector.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Weinfield & Rudenko.\n[1] (1940) Q.R. 69 K.B. 154.\n[2] [1931] S.C.H. 321.\n[3] [1897] A.C., at p. 29.\n[4] [1931] S.C.R. 321.\n",

Code.\nBy s. 84 (1) of The Highway Traffic Act, 1936, (c. 2), of Prince Edward Island, the licence (to operate a motor vehicle) of a person who is convicted of driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs, \"shall forthwith upon, and automatically with such conviction, be suspended\" for (a) 12 months forthe first offence; and (s. 84(1) (c)) \"the Provincial Secretary shall not issue a licence to any person during the period for which his licence has been cancelled or suspended under this, section.\"\ns. 285 (7) of the Criminal Code of Canada (as amended by 3 Geo. VI, c. 30, s. 6), where a person is convicted, under s. 285 (4), of driving a motor vehicle while intoxicated, the court or justice may, in addition to any other punishment provided, prohibit him from driving a motor vehicle anywhere in Canada during any iperiod not exceeding three years.\nThe respondent, who had a licence to operate a. motor vehicle, good until February 28, 1940, was, on November 20, 1939, convicted under said s. 285(4) of the Cr. Code. On May 28, 1940, he applied for an operator's licence. His application was refused pursuant to said s. 84 (1) (c) of the Highway Traffic Act, as the period of automatic cancellation, under s. 84 (1) (a) upon said conviction, had not expired. From such refusal, respondent, asserting a right of appeal under s. 8 (7) of said Highway Traffic Act, appealed to a County Court Judge, who allowed the appeal and ordered issuance of a licence. The Provincial Secretary appealed to the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island en bane, which (15 M.P.R. 271) dismissed the appeal, holding that the County Court Judge had jurisdiction to make the order and that there was no appeal there from, and holding further that, by reason of the enactment of said s. 285 (7) of the Cr. Code, s. 84 (1) of said provincial Act had become ultra vires. The Provincial Secretary appealed (leave to do so being granted by said Supreme Court en banc) to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the order of the County Court Judge set aside.\nThere was no right of appeal to the County Court Judge from the refusal of the Provincial Secretary to grant a licence to respondent. Said s. 8 (7) of the Highway Traffic Act did not apply. The right of appeal given by s. 8 (7) is to a person aggrieved by refusal to grant a licence or by revocation of a licence under s. 8. The refusal in question was not a refusal under s. 8; nor was there revocation of licence under s. 8. The law itself, s. 84 (1) of the Act, said that respondent, in the premises, was not entitled to a licence. The Provincial Secretary was merely carrying out the law, and had no discretion. There was no provision authorizing an appeal to the County Court Judge under such circumstances; and his order was made without jurisdiction. The Supreme Court en banc should have so held, and set aside the order. It was not legally seized of the question whether s. 84 (1) of the Highway Traffic Act was ultra vires.\nUpon said constitutional question, this Count expressed opinion as follows: The field of s. 285(7) Cr. Code, and that of s. 84(1) of said provincial Act are not coextensive. The Dominion, in enacting s. 285 (4) (7), has not invaded the whole field in such a way as to exclude all provincial jurisdiction. It cannot have superseded the provincial enactment, which was obviously made from the provincial aspect of defining the right to use the highways in the province and intended to operate in a purely provincial field. The provincial enactment does not impose an additional penalty for a violation of, or interfere with, the criminal law; it provides, in the way of civil regulation of the use of highways and vehicles, for a civil disability arising out of a conviction for a criminal offence; and that does not make it legislation in relation to criminal law. The undisputed authority of the province to issue licences or permits for the right to drive motor vehicles on its highways, carries with it the authority to suspend or cancel them upon the happening of certain conditions. Said s. 84 (1) deals purely with certain civil rights in the province, and is not ultra vires. (Bedard v. Dawson, [1923] S.C.R. 681; Lymburn v. Mayland, [1932] A.C. 318, referred to).\nPer the Chief Justice: Primarily, responsibility for the regulation of highway traffic, including authority to prescribe the conditions and the manner of the use of motor vehicles on highways and the operation of a system of licences for the purpose of securing the observance of regulations respecting these matters in the interest of the public generally, is committed to the local legislatures. S. 84 (1) (a) (c) of said provincial Act is concerned with the subject of licensing, over which it is essential that the Province should primarily have control; and so long as the purpose of the provincial legislation and its immediate effect are exclusively to prescribe the conditions under which licences are granted, forfeited or suspended, it is not, speaking generally, necessarily impeachable as repugnant to s. 285 (7), Cr. Code, in the sense that it is so related to the substance of the Dominion enactment as to be brought within the scope of criminal law in the sense of s. 91 of the BN.A. Act by force of the last paragraph of s. 91. There is no adequate ground for the conclusion that the provincial enactments in question are in their true character attempts to prescribe penalties for the offences dealt with by the Cr. Code, rather than enactments in regulation of licences.\nS. 285 (7) Cr. Code, is intra vires.\nS. 1 of c. 5, Acts of 1940, P.E.I., gives prima facie an appeal to the Supreme Court, PJE.L, from any decree, judgment, order or conviction by a Judge of a County Court who is acting in a judicial capacity, though persona designata and not as the County Court, under the authority of a Provincial Act. The fact that the Judge has acted without jurisdiction does not affect this right of appeal. Questions of jurisdiction are within the scope of the appeal.\nAPPEAL by the Provincial Secretary of the Province of Prince Edward Island, and also by the Attorney-General of that Province as intervenant, from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island en banc ([1]) dismissing the appeal of the Provincial Secretary from the order made by His Honour, C. Gavan Duffy, Judge of the County Court for Queens County in said Province, ordering the Department of the Provincial Secretary, upon application by Michael Egan (the present respondent) in the ordinary way and upon payment of the usual fee and without any certificate of competency (the order recited an admission of competency), to issue to the said Egan a licence to operate motor vehicles in the said province.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions involved are sufficiently stated in the reasons for judgment in this Court now reported, and are indicated in the above head-note.\nSpecial leave to appeal to this Court was granted by an order of the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island en banc; the order reciting an undertaking by appellant to make no application for costs against respondent. The order also gave leave to the Attorney-General of Prince Edward Island to intervene.\nThe Attorney-General of Canada and the Attorney-General for Ontario were granted leave to appear before this Court and argue for or against the judgment appealed from, on the point of the constitutionality of the relevant provisions of the Criminal Code and of the Prince Edward Island Highway Traffic Act. Hon. Thane A. Campbell K.C. for the appellant and for the intervenant.\nHon. Gordon D. Conant K.C. and C. R. Magone K.C. for the Attorney-General for Ontario.\nF. P. Varcoe K.C. for the Attorney-General of Canada.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2014I think the contention of the appellant is well founded that section (1) of chap. 5 of the P.E.I. Statutes of 1940 gives prima facie an appeal to the Supreme Court (P.E.I.) from any decree, judgment, order, or conviction by a Judge of a County Court who is acting in a judicial capacity, though persona designata and not as the County Court, under the authority of a Provincial statute. This is not intended to be an exhaustive description, but in such circumstances I think an appeal lies.\nThe fact that the County Judge has acted without jurisdiction does not, in my opinion, affect this right of appeal. Once the conclusion is reached that the section intends to give an appeal to the Supreme Court, even where the County Court Judge is exercising a special jurisdiction and not as the County Court, I can see no reason for limiting the scope of the appeal in such a way as to exclude questions of jurisdiction. As the Attorney-General observed in the course of his argument, lawyers are more familiar with the practice of dealing with questions of jurisdiction raised by proceedings by way of certiorari and prohibition. A tribunal exercising a limited statutory jurisdiction has no authority to give a binding decision upon its own jurisdiction and where it wrongfully assumes jurisdiction it follows, as a general rule, that, since what he has done is null, there is nothing to appeal from. But here we have a statute and this is only pertinent on the point of the meaning and effect of the statute.\nIt has always seemed to me that the proceeding by way of appeal would be the most convenient way of questioning the judgment of any judicial tribunal whose judgment is alleged to be wrong, whether in point of wrongful assumption of jurisdiction, or otherwise. There is no appeal, of course, except by statute and, I repeat, the question arising upon this point is entirely a question of the scope and effect of this statute. Section 2 of the Statute, moreover, as the Attorney-General points out, imports the procedure under Part XV of the Criminal Code.\nThe point we have to consider is whether, by reason of the enactment of section 285 (7) of the Criminal Code, the jurisdiction prima facie given to the Province to enact the provisions of section 84 (1) (a) and (c) of the Highway Traffic Act of 1936 is suspended. This section of the Criminal Code provides that where a person is convicted of an offence under certain subsections of that section, the court or justice may, in addition to any other punishment provided for such offence, make an order prohibiting such person from driving a motor vehicle or automobile anywhere in Canada during any period not exceeding three years. The attack upon the provincial legislation may, perhaps, be put in this way: the effect of section 285 (7) is to bring the matters with which it deals within the subject of the criminal law, which is explicitly assigned to the Dominion as one of the enumerated subjects under section 91; then it is said that the matters so legislated upon are of such a scope that they extend to and include within their ambit the matters dealt with by section 84 (1) of the Highway Traffic Act of 1936 and that, consequently, the clause at the end of section 91 comes into play, and that these matters are excluded, so long as the Dominion legislation remains in force, from the jurisdiction of the Province.\nAs against this it is argued by the Attorney-General of Prince Edward Island that section 285 (7) is ultra vires; that the legislative prohibition which is there imposed upon convicted persons against driving a motor vehicle or automobile is not within the ambit of section 91 (27).\nI may say at once I cannot agree with this view. I do not think anything is to be gained by discussing the point at large. It appears to me to be quite clear that such prohibitions may be imposed as punishment in exercise of the authority vested in the Dominion to legislate in relation to criminal law and procedure.\nA very different question, however, is raised by the contention that the matters legislated upon by the enactments of the Provincial Highway Traffic Act in question have, by force of section 285 (7) of the Criminal Code, been brought exclusively within the scope of the Dominion authority in relation to criminal law. We are here on rather delicate ground. We have to consider the effect of legislation by the Dominion creating a crime and imposing punishment for it in effecting the suspension of provincial legislative authority in relation to matters prima facie within the provincial jurisdiction. I say we are on delicate ground because the subject of criminal law entrusted to the Parliament of Canada is necessarily an expanding field by reason of the authority of the Parliament to create crimes, impose punishment for such crimes, and to deal with criminal procedure. If there is a conflict between Dominion legislation and Provincial legislation, then nobody doubts that the Dominion legislation prevails. But even where there is no actual conflict, the question often arises as to the effect of Dominion legislation in excluding matters from provincial jurisdiction which would otherwise fall within it. I doubt if any test can be stated with accuracy in general terms for the resolution of such questions. It is important to remember that matters which, from one point of view and for one purpose, fall exclusively within the Dominion authority, may, nevertheless, be proper subjects for legislation by the Province from a different point of view, although this is a principle that must be \"applied only with great caution.\" (Attorney-General for Canada v. Attorney-General for Alberta ([2])).\nBy section 91 of. the British North America Act,\u2014\n* * * it is * * * declared that (notwithstanding anything in this Act) the exclusive Legislative Authority of the Parliament of Canada extends to all Matters coming within the Classes of Subjects next hereinafter enumerated; that is to say,\u2014 * * * 27. The Criminal Law, except the Constitution of Courts of Criminal Jurisdiction, but including the Procedure in Criminal Matters. * * * And any Matter coming within any of the Classes of Subjects enumerated in this Section shall not be deemed to come within the Class of Matters of a local or private Nature comprised in the Enumeration of the Classes of Subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the Legislatures of the Provinces.\nThe effect of the concluding part of section 91 is that the Parliament of Canada may legislate upon matters which are prima facie committed exclusively to the Provincial Legislatures by section 92, where such legislation is necessarily incidental to the exercise of the powers conferred upon Parliament in relation to the specified subject \"The Criminal Law * * * including the Procedure in Criminal Matters.\" To the extent, at least, to which matters prima facie provincial are regulated by Dominion legislation in exercise of this authority, such matters are excepted from those committed to the provincial legislatures by section 92; and, accordingly, the legislative authority of the provinces in relation to these matters is suspended. The subject is discussed in Attorney-General for Ontario v. Attorney-General for the Dominion ([3]).\nIn every case where a dispute arises, the precise question must be whether or not the matter of the provincial legislation that is challenged is so related to the substance of the Dominion criminal legislation as to be brought within the scope of criminal law in the sense of section 91. If there is repugnancy between the provincial enactment and the Dominion enactment, the provincial enactment is, of 'course, inoperative. It would be most unwise, I think, to attempt to lay down any rules for determining repugnancy in this sense. The task of applying the general principles is not made less difficult by reason of the jurisdiction of the provincial legislatures under the fifteenth paragraph of section 92 to create penal offences which may be truly criminal in their essential character. (The King v. Nat. Bell Liquors Ld. ([4]), and Nadan v. The King ([5])).\nI do not find any difficulty in dealing with the present case. Primarily, responsibility for the regulation of highway traffic, including authority to prescribe the conditions and the manner of the use of motor vehicles on highways and the operation of a system of licences for the purpose of securing the observance of regulations respecting these matters in the interest of the public generally, is committed to the local legislatures.\nSections 84 (1) (a) and (c) are enactments dealing with licences. The legislature has thought fit to regard convictions of the classes specified as a proper ground for suspending the licence of the convict. Such legislation, I think, is concerned with the subject of licensing, over which it is essential that the Province should primarily have control. In exercising such control it must, of course, abstain from legislating on matters within the enumerated subjects of section 91. Suspension of a driving licence does involve a prohibition against driving; but so long as the purpose of the provincial legislation and its immediate effect are exclusively to prescribe the conditions under which licences are granted, forfeited, or suspended, I do not think, speaking generally, it is necessarily impeachable as repugnant to section 285 (7) of the Criminal Code in the sense above mentioned.\nIt is, of course, beyond dispute that where an offence is created by competent Dominion legislation in exercise of the authority under section 91 (27), the penalty or penalties attached to that offence, as well as the offence itself, become matters within that paragraph of section 91 which are excluded from provincial jurisdiction.\nThere is, however, no adequate ground for the conclusion that these particular enactments (section 84 (1) (a) and (c)) are in their true character attempts to prescribe penalties for the offences mentioned, rather than enactments in regulation of licences.\nIt remains only to add that what I have said is strictly directed to cases in which the controversy is whether or not a given competent enactment of the Parliament of Canada creating a criminal offence has the effect of excluding a given subject matter from the legislative authority of the province.\nI have only to add that I concur with my brother Rinfret.\nThe judgment of Rinfret, Crocket and Kerwin JJ. was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014On November 20th, 1939, the respondent was convicted by the Stipendiary Magistrate for Queens County, in the Province of Prince Edward Island, for that he \" unlawfully did operate a motor vehicle on the public highway whilst intoxicated, contrary to section 285, subsection 4, paragraph (b), of the Criminal Code of Canada.\"\nAs a result of that conviction, in virtue of section 84 (1) of The Highway Traffic Act of Prince Edward Island, 1936, the respondent's licence to operate a motor vehicle, otherwise valid until February 28th, 1940, was automatically cancelled for a period of twelve months.\nThe relevant part of section 84 reads as follows: 84. (1) The licence of a person who is convicted of driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs, shall ' forthwith upon, and automatically with such conviction, be suspended for a period:\n(a) of twelve months for the first offence; * * *\n(c) The Provincial Secretary shall not issue a licence to any person during the period for which his licence has been cancelled or suspended under this section.\nOn May 28th, 1940, the respondent applied for an operator's licence. The application was in the statutory form and contained the following questions and answers, amongst others:\u2014\nHas your licence ever been cancelled for any cause; if so in what year? On November 20th, 1939.\nAnd for what reason? For conviction under Criminal Code for driving motor car while intoxicated.\nThe Acting Deputy Provincial Secretary, in notifying the respondent that his application was refused, wrote to him:\n* * * the Provincial Secretary has no alternative but to refuse the same, pursuant to paragraph (c) of subsection 84 (1) of the said Highway Traffic Act, owing to the fact that on the 20th day of November, AD. 1939, you were convicted before George J. Tweedy, Esq., K.C., Stipendiary Magistrate for Queens County, on a charge of operating a motor vehicle on the 19th day of November, 1939, while intoxicated, and the period of cancellation fixed by the said section has not yet expired.\nFrom this refusal, the respondent appealed to the Judge of the County Court of Queens County.\nHis appeal professed to be asserted under sec. 8 (7) of the Highway Traffic Act, which reads as follows:\n8. (7) If any person is aggrieved by the refusal of the Department to grant a licence or by the revocation of a licence under this section, he may, after giving to the Department notice of his intention to do so, appeal to the County Court Judge of the County Court of the County in which any office where the business of the Department with respect to the granting of licences is carried on is situate and on such appeal the Judge may make such order as he thinks fit and any order so made shall be binding on the Department for the year in which it was made.\nThe Judge of the County Court of Queens County, after having heard counsel on behalf of the present respondent, as well as for the Provincial Secretary\u2014and counsel for the Provincial Secretary \"having admitted the competency of the [respondent] to operate and drive motor vehicles\"\u2014 allowed the appeal and ordered\nthat the Department of the Provincial Secretary shall, upon his [the respondent's] application in the ordinary way and upon payment of the\n[page 405]\nusual fee and without any certificate of competency, issue to the [said] Michael Egan a licence to operate motor vehicles in the Province of Prince Edward Island.\nFrom this order, the appellant appealed to the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island (sitting en banc), which Court dismissed the appeal, but afterwards granted leave to appeal from such dismissal to the Supreme Court of Canada. Leave to intervene was granted the Attorney-General of Prince Edward Island.\nThe reasons for judgment of the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island were delivered by Mr. Justice Arsenault. He stated that, under the provisions of the Criminal Code, \"the Stipendiary Magistrate could have made a further order prohibiting the accused from driving a motor vehicle for a period not exceeding three years.\" He pointed, however, to the fact that the Magistrate had not done so, but that he certified to the Provincial Secretary that the present respondent had been convicted; that the conviction was made on November 20, 1939, and that, had the licence not been cancelled in pursuance of section 84 of The Highway Traffic Act of 1936, the respondent's operator's licence would have expired on February 28, 1940; that the respondent took no further step to have his licence restored but that, six months afterwards, to wit, on 28th May, 1940, he made application on the regular form for an operator's licence. The learned Judge then mentioned what I have already stated: that the Provincial Secretary refused to issue the licence on account of the conviction, that upon appeal to the Judge of the County Court of Queens County, the Department of the Provincial Secretary had been ordered to issue a licence to the respondent as aforesaid, and that the Provincial Secretary now appealed to the Supreme Court (en banc) chiefly on the following grounds:\n1st. That the County Court Judge had no jurisdiction to make the order;\n2nd. That notwithstanding the provisions of sec. 285, subs. 7 of the Code, the Provincial Secretary had a right to refuse to issue the said licence.\nThe respondent, the judgment appealed from proceeds to say, contended that as the Criminal Code, by sec. 285, subs. 7, has now made due provisions for the punishment of such an offence and has empowered the convicting magistrate to impose a further penalty by suspension of the offending party's licence, section 84 (1) of the Highway Traffic Act, 1936, has ipso facto become ultra vires.\nDealing first with the question of the jurisdiction of the Judge of the County Court to make the order complained of, the judgment states the appellant's contention that section 8 (7) of the Highway Traffic Act, under which the Judge of the County Court purported to act, did not give him jurisdiction to make the order. The judgment notes\nthat the appeal to the Judge of the County Court was not from the order of the Provincial Secretary cancelling the respondent's licence but from the refusal of the Provincial Secretary to issue an operator's licence after the old licence had expired by effluxion of time.\nThe decision is that the appeal was properly taken under section 8 and subsections of the Highway Traffic Act and that the Judge of the County Court had jurisdiction to make the order. It adds that:\nThere are no provisions in the Act for any appeal from the County Court Judge's decision. He is persona designata under the Act and as such his order is final and not appealable. Sec. 8(7) seems [so it is stated] to make this clear when it says\u2014\" The Judge may make such order as he thinks fit and any order so made shall be binding on the Department for the year in which it was made.\"\nIt was accordingly adjudged that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nBut although, in view of the above decision, it was not necessary to consider \" the question of the ultra vires of sec. 84 (1) of the Highway Traffic Act,\" it was thought advisable to deal with it and to say\nthat since the Criminal Code has invaded the field by enacting sec. 285, subsec. 7, amended by 3 George VI, 1939, oh. 30, sec. 6, it follows that the provisions of the Highway Traffic Act as to cancellation of a licence on a conviction for driving a motor car whilst intoxicated, have become ultra vires.\nIt is from the above judgment that the Provincial Secretary of the Province of Prince Edward Island now appeals, with the intervention of the Attorney-General of the same province, by leave of the Supreme Court (en banc). The Attorney-General of Canada and the Attorney-General for Ontario were granted leave to appear before this Court and to argue for or against the judgment appealed from, on the point of the constitutionality of the relevant sections of the Criminal Code and of the Highway Traffic Act of Prince Edward Island.\nThe first question to be examined is whether, as contended by the appellant and the intervenant, the Judge of the County Court of Queens County had no jurisdiction, on appeal from the refusal of the Provincial Secretary of the Province of Prince Edward Island to issue, for the year 1940, a driver's licence to the respondent.\nSubsection 7 of section 8 of the Highway Traffic Act, under which the respondent contended that his appeal was competently asserted, has already been reproduced. That subsection gives a right of appeal to the County Court Judge to \"any person aggrieved by the refusal of the Department to grant a licence or by the revocation of a licence under this section.\"To my mind, the words \"under this section\" qualify both the refusal of the Department to grant a licence and the revocation of a licence. It must have been a refusal or a revocation \"under this section,\" to wit, under section 8 of the Highway Traffic Act.\nSection 8 deals with chauffeurs' and drivers' licences. It enacts that every person shall, before driving a motor vehicle on a highway, in any year, pay a certain fee to the Department and obtain a licence for that year. It states what the licence shall contain, provides for the changes of address and then, in subsections 4, 5 and 6, stipulates that\n(4) Every owner of a registered motor vehicle shall be entitled to receive an Operator's Licence free of charge, and shall produce a certificate of qualification to operate a motor vehicle or such other evidence of qualification as shall be satisfactory to the Secretary.\n(5) If, from the application or otherwise, it appears that the applicant is not competent to drive or is suffering from any disease or disability, the Department shall refuse to grant the license;\nProvided that the applicant, except in the case of diseases and. disabilities as may be prescribed, may claim to be subjected to a test as to his competency or as to his fitness or ability to drive a motor vehicle and if he passes the prescribed test and is not otherwise disqualified the licence shall not be refused by reason only of the provisions of this subsection.\n(6) If it appears to the Department that there is reason to believe that any person who holds a licence granted by it, is not competent to drive or is suffering from a disease or physical disability likely to cause the driving by him of a motor vehicle to be a source of danger to the public and on inquiry into the matter the Department is satisfied that\nhe is not competent to drive or is suffering from such a disease or dis- ability, then whether or not such licensee has previously passed a test under this section, the Department may, after giving him notice of its intention so to do, revoke the licence.\nProvided that the licensee may, except in the case of such diseases and disabilities as may be prescribed, claim to be subjected to a test as to his competency or his fitness or ability to drive a motor vehicle and if he passes the prescribed test the licence shall not be revoked.\nIt is after the above transcribed subsections 4, 5 and 6 that subsection 7 appears in section 8.\nIt is clear, therefore, that the two cases in which a person aggrieved may appeal to the County Court Judge under section 8 are:\n(1) When there has been a refusal of the Department to grant a licence to the owner of a registered motor vehicle, either without being or after he has been subjected to a test as to his competency, his fitness, or his ability to drive such a vehicle;\n(2) When there has been a revocation of the licence under subsection 6, where it appeared to the Department that there was reason to believe that the person holding a licence was not competent to drive, or was suffering from a disease or physical disability likely to cause the driving by him to be a source of danger to the public, etc.\nSection 8 of the Highway Traffic Act. contains fifteen other subsections; but they are not material for the purposes of this appeal and they do not affect the application of subsections 4, 5, 6 and 7.\nIn this case, there was no refusal of the Department to grant a licence, neither was there revocation of a licence, under section 8.\nIt was not the Department, or the Provincial Secretary of the Province, who refused to grant a licence within the meaning of subsections 4 and 5 of section 8. The licence of the respondent was automatically suspended for a period of twelve months under section 84 (subsection (1) (a)) of the Highway Traffic Act, on account of the fact that the respondent had been convicted of driving a vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, and the Act itself prescribes that, in such a case, \" the Provincial Secretary shall not issue a licence to any person during the period for which his licence has been cancelled or suspended under this section,\" i.e., under section 84.\nIt follows that it was not the Provincial Secretary who refused the issue of a licence to the respondent, within the meaning of section 8; but the law itself said that the respondent, in the premises, was not entitled to a licence. The Provincial Secretary was not exercising any discretion in withholding a licence from the respondent; he was merely carrying out the provisions of the law, and he had no discretion to exercise. There is no provision in the Highway Traffic Act authorizing an appeal to a County Court Judge under such circumstances. Subsection 7 of section 8, invoked by the respondent, has no application in such a case.\nThere was, therefore, no such right of appeal by the respondent as the latter professed to assert to the Judge of the County Court of Queens County. The order made by the said Judge to the Department of the Provincial Secretary that it should \" upon his application in the ordinary way and upon payment of the usual fee and without any certificate of competency issue to the [respondent], Michael Egan, a licence to operate motor vehicles in the Province of Prince Edward Island \" was issued without jurisdiction and was absolutely ineffective to compel the Provincial Secretary to issue the licence.\nI am, therefore, of the opinion that the Provincial Secretary was right in contending before the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island that the County Court Judge had no jurisdiction to make the order and that, on that ground, his appeal should have been maintained by the Supreme Court en banc.\nI agree with the Attorney-General of Prince Edward Island that it would be inconceivable that the Legislature would have intended to grant an appeal from a refusal by the Provincial Secretary in cases where the cancellation is automatic and the refusal of a reissue is imperative.\nI must now proceed to state the consequences which flow from the conclusion just reached.\nThere being no jurisdiction in the County Court Judge of Queens County to hear the appeal of the respondent and to make any order as a result of such appeal, there was no right of appeal, if any, to the Supreme Court en banc, except on the question of the jurisdiction of the County Court Judge.\nThe Supreme Court en banc could decide, and in this case should have decided, that the County Court Judge of Queens County was without jurisdiction and that his order was not competently made, but nothing else. The appeal of the Provincial Secretary should have been allowed by the Supreme Court en banc and the order of the County Court Judge should have been set aside. That would have been the end of the matter; and not only do I agree with the Supreme Court that, in view of the decision, \" it was not necessary to consider the question of the ultra vires of section 84 (1) of the Highway Traffic Act\"; but, with respect, my view is that the Supreme Court was not legally seized of that question and it had no jurisdiction to pass upon it in the present case.\nThe above reasons are sufficient to allow the appeal of the appellant, the Provincial Secretary of the Province of Prince Edward Island, and of the intervenant, the Attorney-General of Prince Edward Island. I have no doubt, so far, that the Supreme Court of Canada has jurisdiction to entertain the appeal on the grounds just mentioned, and that is to say: on the question of the respective jurisdiction of the Supreme Court en banc and of the County Court of Queens County.\nThe present situation is somewhat similar to that which obtained in the case of The Grand Council of the Canadian Order of Chosen Friends v. The Local Government Board and the Town of Humboldt, which was submitted to this Court ([6]). In that case, the Grand Council contended that an order of The Local Government Board of Saskatchewan was made by the Board in excess of its powers, and sought to have the order reversed and declared inoperative or set aside. The order had been made by the Local Board pursuant to The Local Government Board (Special Powers) Act, 1922, of Saskatchewan. The Grand Council, being dissatisfied with the order, applied to Embury J., one of the learned judges of the Court of King's Bench, for leave to appeal; and, upon the hearing of the application, it was objected by the respondents, the Local Government Board and the Town of Humboldt, that no appeal lay from any order of the Local Government Board and that, consequently, there was no jurisdiction to grant leave in the case. The objection was overruled and leave to appeal was granted. The Grand Council asserted its appeal in pursuance of the leave so granted; but the Local Government Board and the Town of Humboldt also appealed to the Court of Appeal from the order of Embury J. Before the hearing of these appeals, the Grand Council gave notice to the Attorney-General of Saskatchewan that it would bring into question the constitutional validity of the sections of the Local Government (Special Powers) Act, 1922, upon which was thought to depend the absence of the right of appeal invoked by the Grand Council of the Order. The two appeals came on for hearing at the same time and the appeal of the Town of Humbolt was allowed upon the ground that the statute gave no right of appeal from the order of the Local Board. The Court held, moreover, that the appeal of the Grand Council from the said order should be dismissed. Thus, both appeals were disposed of unfavourably to the Grand Council. The latter then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada by leave of the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan. The conclusion of this Court was in agreement with that reached by the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan; and, seeing that the latter court had no jurisdiction in the premises, the appeal was dismissed with costs.\nIn the Grand Council case ([7]), as will have been noticed, leave to appeal to this Court had been granted by the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan in the same way as, in the present case, leave to appeal has been granted by the Supreme Court en banc of Prince Edward Island. It would seem that, even if there was not a right of appeal to this Court upon the question of the jurisdiction of the two courts below, the granting of special leave to appeal would, in itself, be sufficient to establish jurisdiction in this Court, as was asserted in Grand Council of the Canadian Order of Chosen Friends v. The Local Government Board and the Town of Humboldt ([8]).\nThe reasons already stated are sufficient to dispose of the appeal; and, following a wise and well defined tradition, this Court should, no doubt, refrain from expressing an opinion upon any other point not necessary for the decision of the case.\nThe Supreme Court en banc, however, thought it advisable to deal with the question of the constitutionality of section 84 (1) of the Highway Traffic Act, 1936, since the Criminal Code has enacted sec. 285, subs. 7, amended by sec. 6 of ch. 30 of the Statutes of Canada, 3 Geo. VI (1939). And that Court declared ultra vires the provision of the Highway Traffic Act \"as to cancellation of a licence on a conviction for driving a motor car whilst intoxicated.\"\nIt is because of the declaration on that point that the Attorney-General of Prince Edward Island has carried his appeal to this Court and that the Attorney-General of Canada and the Attorney-General for Ontario have been allowed to intervene. It was represented to us that this declaration has an important and wide consequence and that, while only an obiter dictum, it might affect the jurisprudence not only in Prince Edward Island but also in other provinces. It appears desirable, therefore, that this Court should express its opinion upon the matter.\nThe Criminal Code Amendment Act, 1939, c. 30, s. 6, contains an amendment whereby subs. 7 of sec. 285, as enacted by sec. 16, c. 44, of the Statutes of Canada of 1938, is repealed and the following substituted therefore:\n(7) Where any person is convicted of an offence under the provisions of subsections one, two, four or six of this section the court or justice may, in addition to any other punishment provided for such offence, make an order prohibiting such person from driving a motor vehicle or auto-mobile anywhere in Canada during any period not exceeding three years. In the event of such an order being made the court or justice shall forward a copy thereof to the registrar of motor vehicles for the province wherein a permit or licence to drive a motor vehicle or auto-mobile was issued to such person. Such copy shall be certified under the seal of such court or justice or, if there be no such seal, under the hand of a judge or presiding magistrate of such court or of such justice.\nSubsection 4 of section 285, referred to in subsection 7 above reproduced, contains the enactment of the Criminal Code covering the case of driving while intoxicated.\nIt follows that, under subsection 7 as now amended, a person convicted of driving while intoxicated may be prohibited \" from driving a motor vehicle or automobile anywhere in Canada during any period not exceeding three years\"; while, under section 84(1) of the Highway Traffic Act of Prince Edward Island, the licence of a person so convicted \" shall forthwith upon, and automatically with such conviction, be suspended for a period of twelve months for the first offence \" and \" not less than twelve months and not exceeding two years for the second offence \"; and for the third offence he shall be prohibited from holding a licence.\nThe Supreme Court en banc stated that the Criminal Code had \"invaded the field\" and that section 84 of the Highway Traffic Act had thereby become ultra vires. In this Court, the Attorney-General of Canada submitted that the subsection of the Criminal Code in question was intra vires, as being an enactment in relation to the Criminal Law. He argued that this subsection provided an additional punishment for the various offences in connection with the driving of vehicles under the preceding subsections of section 285; that this was not legislation in relation to civil rights, although it may be legistion affecting civil rights, legislation for the punishment of crime being clearly legislation within the competency of the Parliament of Canada.\nThe Prince Edward Island legislation, it was submitted, was enacted as a punishment measure, rather than to provide for the safety on the highway. Section 84 bans individuals convicted of certain offences from the highways for short periods of time; and it is included in a group of sections under the heading: \"Penalties.\"\nIt was submitted that, although the provincial provision might otherwise have been valid, since it conflicts with the Criminal Code, the latter must now prevail (See Lord Tomlin in Attorney-General for Canada v. Attorney-General for British Columbia ([9])).\nThe Attorney-General for Ontario contended that, even though it be found that section 285(7) of the Criminal Code is intra vires of the Parliament of Canada, it is not in conflict with provincial legislation providing that, upon conviction of a person for driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquors or drugs, his licence, or permit, to drive shall be suspended. He relied upon Grand Trunk Railway Company of Canada v. Attorney-General of Canada ([10]).\nHe submitted that the control of the roads and highways and the regulation of the traffic thereon are matters within s. 92 of the B.N.A. Act assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces: Head 9, \" * * * and other Licences in order to the raising of a Revenue for Provincial, Local, or Municipal Purposes\"; Head 13, \"Property and Civil Rights in the Province\"; Head 16, \"Generally all Matters of a merely local or private Nature in the Province.\"\nThe words \"and other licences \"have been held not ejusdem generis with\" shop, saloon, tavern, auctioneer,\" by which Head 9 is introduced. (Brewers and Maltsters' Association of Ontario v. Attorney-General for Ontario ([11]); Attorney-General of Manitoba v. Manitoba Licence Holders' Association ([12]); Shannon v. Lower Mainland Dairy Products Board ([13])). In the latter case, Lord Atkin said:\nIt cannot, as their Lordships think, be an objection to a licence plus a fee that it is directed both to the regulation of trade and to the provision of revenue.\nThe Attorney-General of Prince Edward Island also contended that both sections of the Criminal Code and of the Highway Traffic Act could validly subsist together and that section 285(7) of the Criminal Code had no effect whatever on the validity of the Provincial section 84.\nI am respectfully of the opinion that the field of the two enactments is not coextensive; and it is not, therefore, necessary to pronounce upon the validity of section 285(7) of the Criminal Code.\nThe Dominion legislation would prevent the offender from operating a motor vehicle throughout Canada \"during any period not exceeding three years.\" It would not prevent him from holding a licence or accompanying a beginner, as provided for by the Prince Edward Island legislation. The Provincial legislation in question in this case is, in pith and substance, within the classes of subjects assigned to the Provincial legislatures; it is licensing legislation confined to the territory of Prince Edward Island. The Criminal Code provides for an order prohibiting a person from driving, irrespective of whether a licence has been issued to him or not. The automatic cancellation of the Prince Edward Island licence would not, of itself, prevent the person affected by it from obtaining a driver's licence in other provinces.\nIt cannot be open to contention for a moment that the imposing of such a penalty for enforcing a law of the competency of Prince Edward Island is an interference with criminal law, under section 91, subs. 27. Regina v. Watson ([14]). It is not an additional penalty imposed for a violation of the criminal law. It provides for a civil disability arising out of a conviction for a criminal offence. The right of building highways and of operating them within a province, whether under direct authority of the Government, or by means of independent companies or municipalities, is wholly within the purview of the province (O'Brien v. Allen ([15])), and so is the right to provide for the safety of circulation and traffic on such highways. The aspect of that field is wholly provincial, from the point of view both of the use of the highway and of the use of the vehicles. It has to do with the civil regulation of the use of highways and personal property, the protection of the persons and property of the citizens, the prevention of nuisances and the suppression of conditions calculated to make circulation and traffic dangerous. Such is, amongst others, the provincial aspect of section 84 of the Highway Traffic Act. It has nothing to do with the Dominion aspect of the creation of a crime and its punishment. And it cannot be said that the Dominion, while constituting the criminal offence of driving while intoxicated and providing for certain penalties therefore, has invaded the whole field in such a way as to exclude all provincial jurisdiction. It cannot have superseded section 84, which was obviously made from the provincial aspect of defining the right to use the highways in Prince Edward Island and intended to operate in a purely provincial field.\nAs to the contention that the Provincial legislation imposes an additional penalty for the punishment of an offence already punished by the Criminal Code, the answer, it seems to me, is simply that the Provincial legislation does not do so.\nThe offender found guilty under the Criminal Code, as already pointed out, may be prohibited from driving a motor vehicle or automobile anywhere in Canada during the period mentioned in the Code. The order, if made by the convicting magistrate, will operate quite independently of any licence granted by the Provincial authority. In that sense, it would be allowed to supersede the Provincial legislation. But section 84 of The Highway Traffic Act of Prince Edward Island, dealing with the case of its own licensees upon the territory of its own province, provides that a person convicted of driving while intoxicated loses his provincial licence, either for a time or forever (in the case of a third offence). It does not create an offence; it does not add to or vary the punishment already declared by the Criminal Code; it does not change or vary the procedure to be followed in the enforcement of any provision of the Criminal Code. It deals purely and simply with certain civil rights in the Province of Prince Edward Island. Such legislation can rely upon the decision, in this Court, of B\u00e9dard v. Dawson and the Attorney-General for Quebec ([16]). As pointed out in that case by the present Chief Justice,\nThe legislation impugned seems to be aimed at suppressing conditions calculated to favour the development of crime rather than at the punishment of crime. This is an aspect of the subject in respect of which the provinces seem to be free to legislate. I think the legislation is not invalid.\nThere may be added what was said by Lord Atkin, in Lymburn v. Mayland ([17]):\nIt was contended on behalf of the Attorney-General for the Dominion that to impose a condition making the bond fall due upon conviction for a criminal offence was to encroach upon the sole right of the Dominion to legislate in respect of the criminal law. It indirectly imposed an additional punishment for a criminal offence. Their Lordships do not consider this objection well founded. If the legislation be otherwise intra vires, the imposition of such an ordinary condition in a bond taken to secure good conduct does not appear to invade In any degree the field of criminal law.\nIt would seem to me beyond doubt that provisions of a provincial statute for the cancellation of licences to carry on certain kinds of business, or creating a disability from holding public offices, or creating any kind of civil disabilities, as a result of a conviction under the Criminal Code, does not make such provisions legislation in relation to criminal law; and, hence, they are not ultra vires of the provincial legislatures. It never occurred to anybody to dispute the power of the provinces to issue licences, or permits, for the right to drive motor vehicles on the highways of their respective territories. Surely the authority to issue such licences, or permits, carries with it the authority to suspend or cancel them, upon the happening of certain conditions. The provision that a person convicted of driving while intoxicated will lose his licence for a time or forever is, in a certain sense, a condition upon which the licence, or permit, is granted by the province.\nI would think, for these reasons, that section 84 of The Highway Traffic Act of Prince Edward Island is not unconstitutional. However, on the ground that the County Court Judge of Queens County had no jurisdiction to make the order in respect of which the appeal has been asserted, I think the appeal should be allowed; but, in view of all the circumstances, there should be no costs to either party in this Court, although the judgment of the Supreme Court en banc, dismissing the appeal of the Provincial Secretary with costs, should be reversed, and the judgment of the Judge of the County Court of Queens County should be set aside, without costs to either party in the courts below.\nHudson J.\u2014The principal question involved here is the constitutional validity of section 84 of the Highway Traffic Act, 1936, of the Province of Prince Edward Island.\nThe Province undoubtedly has the right to regulate highway traffic and, for that purpose, to license persons to use highways. The right to license also involves a right to control and, when necessary, to revoke the licence.\nThe section in question does not create a new offence but makes provision in regard to the licence which has been issued under the provincial authority. I do not think that this can be regarded as an addition to any punishment or penalty provided for in section 285 of the Criminal Code. The situation seems to be analogous to that dealt with by the Judicial Committee in Lymburn v. Mayland ([18]).\nIn my opinion, there is no conflict and the Legislature had a perfect right to pass the section in question. For that reason, I concur in the disposition of this matter proposed by my brother Rinfret.\nTaschereau J.\u2014I believe that the County Court Judge of Queens County had no jurisdiction to hear the appeal, and that no order should have been made by him to grant a licence to the respondent. By an imperative section of the law (s. 84(1)(c) of the Highway Traffic Act), the Provincial Secretary has no discretion to exercise and he cannot issue a licence to any person during the period for which his licence has been cancelled or suspended under the Act.\nIn the present case, the respondent's licence had been cancelled under the authority of section 84 of the High- way Traffic Act, because he had been found guilty of driving an automobile while under the influence of intoxicating liquor. The licence is automatically cancelled by the operation of the law, without the interference of the provincial authorities. In my opinion, the County Court Judge cannot order the Provincial Secretary to do an act which the law imperatively forbids him to do. The jurisdiction of the County Court Judge exists only when the cases mentioned in section 8 of the Act arise, and nowhere do we see that he may do what is complained of in the present case.\nWith respect, I think that the County Court Judge's order was not authorized by the statute, and that the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island should have declared it inoperative, and allowed the appeal.\nThe Supreme Court has also dealt with the question of constitutionality of the section of the Provincial Act with respect to the cancellation of the licence and said:\u2014\nAlthough in view of the above decision, it is not necessary to consider the question of the ultra vires of sec. 84 (1) of the Highway Traffic Act, I think it advisable to deal with it and to say that since the Criminal Code has invaded the field by enacting sec. 285, subsec. 7, amended by 3 George VI (1939), oh. 30, sec. 6, it follows that the provisions of the Highway Traffic Act as to cancellation of a licence on a conviction for driving a motor car whilst intoxicated, have become ultra vires.\nAlthough a conclusion on this appeal can be reached without commenting on this pronouncement, I wish to state that I cannot agree with these views. Section 84 of the Provincial statute, which provides for the cancellation of the licence of any person found guilty of driving an automobile while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, is within the competence of the Provincial Legislature. This section merely provides for a civil disability arising out of a conviction for a criminal offence. The field of criminal law is in no degree invaded by this legislation which is aimed at the suppression of a nuisance on highways. There can be no doubt that the control of the roads and highways and the regulation of traffic there on is assigned by the B.N.A. Act to the Legislatures of the Provinces.\nThis Court and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council have already expressed their views on this matter, and a reference to B\u00e9dard v. Dawson and the Attorney- General of the Province of Quebec ([19]) and Lymburn v. Mayland ([20]) will show that this legislation is intra vires of the Prince Edward Island Legislature.\nI fully agree with what has been said by my brother Rinfret and I believe that the appeal should be allowed but without costs to either party here and in the Courts below.\nAppeal allowed.\nAttorney for the appellant: C.

Under the written terms, upon payment of the consideration therein set out, plaintiffs were to get title to the lands freed from a certain interest therein held by another person, which interest defendant had later acquired. Defendant, claiming that there had been an understanding that plaintiffs would assume the discharging of said interest, insisted, when plaintiffs were making payments, upon additional payments being made to him to cover it. Plaintiffs, who had entered into an agreement requiring for its fulfilment a transfer of the lands to a company, and were concerned to protect their position and secure title, made the additional payments, but, so they alleged, under protest; and sued to recover them back.\nHeld, that defendant had no right to said additional payments; that they were made under protest and under circumstances of practical compulsion; and (even though defendant\u2019s demand was made in the belief that he had a right to them) the plaintiffs were entitled to judgment for repayment of them with interest.

Horner, [1915] 3 K.B. 106, cited.\nAPPEAL by the defendant Knutson from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] allowing, as against said defendant, the appeal of the plaintiffs from the judgment of Greene J. dismissing the action. The action was brought to recover repayment of certain sums which plaintiffs claimed had been unlawfully demanded and received by defendant and had been paid by plaintiffs under protest and without prejudice to their rights under certain agreements. In the Court of Appeal it was adjudged that plaintiffs recover the said sums with interest.\nThe material facts of the case are sufficiently set out in the reasons for judgment in this Court now reported and in the reasons for judgment in the Court of Appeal.\nThe appeal to this Court was dismissed with costs.\nH.F. Parkinson K.C. for the appellant.\nJ.R. Cartwright K.C. for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2014I think the appeal should be dismissed. The law is stated by Willes J. in Great Western Railway Co. v. Sutton[2]:\u2014\nI must say I have always understood that when a man pays more than he is bound to do by law for the performance of a duty which the law says is owed to him for nothing, or for less than he has paid, there is a compulsion or concussion in respect of which he is entitled to recover the excess by condictio indebiti, or action for money had and received. This is every day\u2019s practice as to excess freight.\nI agree that in the circumstances this principle applies.\nI prefer to reserve my opinion in respect of the rights of a person who has paid taxes under an invalid assessment. In such cases there may be special considerations to be taken into account which do not arise here.\nThe judgment of Rinfret, Crocket, Kerwin and Taschereau JJ. was delivered by\nKERWIN J.\u2014This action, brought by all the members, except O.L. Knutson, of Bourkes Syndicate, against Knutson and one Nils Olson, was dismissed by the trial judge. The Court of Appeal for Ontario gave judgment for the plaintiffs against Knutson, who now appeals. The action is to recover certain payments made by the Syndicate to Knutson and claimed to have been made under such circumstances that they were not voluntary. As these payments were made to Knutson alone and Olson received no benefit from them, the action as against the latter stands dismissed, and we are not concerned with his position in the matter except as it is necessary to state it for a proper understanding of the point to be determined.\nAs administrator of an estate, Olson was the registered owner of certain lands recorded in the Office of Land Titles at Haileybury, subject to a caution registered by F.L. Smiley (now His Honour Judge Smiley of the County Court of Carleton), who claimed by the caution to be entitled to a fifteen per cent. interest in the lands. On July 4th, 1936, in consideration of one thousand dollars, Olson granted by an agreement under seal to H. Fred Knutson (a member of the Syndicate and a brother of the defendant O.L. Knutson) an option to purchase these lands free of encumbrance, including the caution. Judge Smiley agreed to this option agreement. H. Fred Knutson was acting on behalf of the members of the Bourkes Syndicate and subsequently executed a declaration of trust to that effect, a syndicate agreement having in the meantime been drawn up and executed.\nOn September 16th, 1936, an agreement under seal was entered into between Olson, H. Fred Knutson and the Syndicate. That document recites the intention of the Syndicate to sell all its right, title and interest under the option agreement to a company to be formed, the registration of the caution, and that Judge Smiley was entitled thereunder to an undivided fifteen per cent. interest in the lands. In it Olson agreed\nas soon as possible to obtain and deliver to the said Company to be formed a properly executed transfer in fee simple under The Land Titles Act (Ontario) of the lands mentioned in the said option agreement, together with a withdrawal of the said caution.\nH. Fred Knutson and the Syndicate agreed to pay Olson, upon the delivery of the transfer, the sum of five thousand dollars and to cause to be issued and delivered to him a specified number of shares of the capital stock of the proposed company. It was agreed that until a proper transfer should be delivered, the five thousand dollars paid, and the shares issued and delivered, the option agreement should remain in full force and effect.\nBy an agreement dated April 13th, 1937, Olson sold and the defendant O.L. Knutson bought the same lands subject to the rights of the other parties to the option agreement of July , 1936, and to the agreement of September 16th, 1936. In this document reference is made to the Smiley caution and it is stated that it was understood and agreed that O.L. Knutson was purchasing Olson\u2019s interest in the lands subject to any claim of Judge Smiley. On April 26th, 1937, O.L. Knutson secured a transfer to himself of Judge Smiley\u2019s interest.\nOne would have no difficulty, on perusing these documents, in concluding that the Syndicate was entitled to a transfer of the interests of Olson, O.L. Knutson and Judge Smiley in the lands, upon payment to O.L. Knutson (who had purchased Olson\u2019s interest) of the sums, and the transfer of the shares, mentioned in the agreement of September 16th, 1936. There is a dispute as to what occurred when that agreement was drawn and executed but there can be no doubt that O.L. Knutson knew that the Syndicate relied upon the written agreement and always took the position that it was entitled to the transfer of the lands from Olson (or O.L. Knutson) without it paying anything to Judge Smiley for his interest.\nNotwithstanding the terms of the agreement of April 13th, 1937, between Olson and O.L. Knutson, the latter relied, as he testifies, upon assurances given him by Olson and H. Fred Knutson that the Syndicate would take care of the Smiley fifteen per cent. interest, and he, having become the owner of that interest, insisted upon being paid an additional fifteen per cent. of the amount that was due under the option agreement of July 4th, 1936, and also upon being paid an additional fifteen per cent. of a further sum when the transaction was finally closed. On the first occasion, the solicitor for the Syndicate made a definite protest, which was written and read at the time of the payment. The position taken by the Syndicate continued unaltered to the knowledge of O.L. Knutson who declined, before the last payment was made, to permit the additional fifteen per cent. to be deposited in trust until the dispute could be settled. In the meantime, again to the knowledge of O.L. Knutson, the Syndicate had agreed to transfer the lands in question to the new company.\nThe trial judge has given O.L. Knutson a certificate of character, and, as he had the advantage of seeing Knutson in the witness box, I accept that finding. In my view, however, both payments were made under protest and under circumstances of practical compulsion,\u2014the first to preserve the Syndicate\u2019s rights under the option agreement, and the second to secure property of which, in equity, the Syndicate had become the owner upon the execution of the agreement of September 16th, 1936, subject only to its carrying out its part of the bargain.\nThe judgment below is based upon a previous decision of the Court of Appeal in Pillsworth v. Town of Cobourg[3]. That type of case raises a problem which does not here exist and I prefer to postpone dealing with it until the occasion arises. The appeal may be disposed of on the principles deducible from the following authorities.\nIn the King\u2019s Bench, in Shaw v. Woodcock[4], Bayley J. states:\u2014\nIf a party has in his possession goods or other property belonging to another, and refuses to deliver such property to that other, unless the latter pays him a sum of money which he has no right to receive, and the latter, in order to obtain possession of his property, pays that sum, the money so paid is a payment made by compulsion and may be recovered back. There is no authority to shew that the two things mentioned in argument are required in order to make the payment compulsory. That being the general rule of law it is quite clear that the sum paid to obtain possession of these policies was not a voluntary payment, and that it may be recovered back, unless the assignees had a right to receive the money.\nThe two things mentioned in argument and referred to by Bayley J. were, first, that the payment must be made in order to get possession of goods for which the owner has an immediate pressing necessity, and the second was that the claim of lien must be clearly void. Holroyd J. states:\u2014\nUpon the question whether a payment be voluntary or not, the law is quite clear. If a party making the payment is obliged to pay, in order to obtain possession of things to which he is entitled, the money so paid is not a voluntary, but a compulsory payment, and may be recovered back; and if the plaintiff below, therefore, was compelled to make the payment in question in order to get the policies of insurance, whether there was a pressing necessity or not, he has a right to recover it back. In Skeate v. Beale[5], the Queen\u2019s Bench determined that duress of goods was not a ground for avoiding an agreement. In Smith v. Sleap[6], the Exchequer decided, on February 5th, 1844, that the defendant, who was holding a document and was paid a certain sum without any right to it, could be compelled to repay. On February 12th, 1844, the Common Pleas in Parker v. The Great Western Railway Company[7], held that certain payments for the carriage of goods, not being voluntary but made in order to induce the railway company to do that which it was bound to do, could be recovered. Then came the decision in the Queen\u2019s Bench in Wakefield v. Newbon[8], which was an action by a mortgagor against the mortgagee\u2019s solicitors to recover a sum of money which the defendants had exacted from the plaintiff by refusing to redeliver his title deeds after a reconveyance to him of the mortgaged property on payment of principal and interest, unless the plaintiff would also pay the amount of the defendants\u2019 bill of costs. Speaking for the Court, Lord Denman referred to \u201cthe principle that money extorted by duress of the plaintiff\u2019s goods, and paid by the plaintiff under protest, may be recovered in an action for money had and received\u201d as having been laid down in the Common Pleas, in the Exchequer, and in the Queen\u2019s Bench, and stated that the principle must be taken as well\u2011established and generally recognized. Referring to the doctrine in Skeate v. Beale[9], Lord Denman remarked that \u201cperhaps it was laid down in terms too general and extensive.\u201d\nOn June 4th, 1844, again in the Common Pleas, judgment was delivered in Close v. Phipps[10], which was a case where the solicitor of a mortgagee, with a power of sale, refused to desist from selling unless the mortgagor would pay expenses with which he was not properly chargeable. Sergeant Talfourd, who was to have supported a rule for a non-suit, admitted that he could not do so after the decision in the Parker case[11], and Chief Justice Tindal, speaking for the Court, said that he thought that the instant case was quite as strong as the Parker case11. This decision was followed in Fraser v. Pendlebury[12], where the action was brought against the mortgagee, and it was held that the payment was not voluntary. \u201cThere is no difference whether the duress be of goods and chattels or of real property or of the person\u201d (per Byles J. at p. 4).\nThe Parker case11 was approved in Great Western Railway Co. v. Sutton[13]. In Maskell v. Horner[14], the Court of Appeal determined that a payment under protest made to avoid a distress threatened by a party who can carry the threat into execution is not a voluntary payment and may be recovered if the circumstances justify it in an action for money had and received, as effectively as if the chattels had been in fact seized.\nHere the evidence is plain that the payments were made under protest and that they were not voluntary in the sense referred to in the cases mentioned. The circumstance that O.L. Knutson thought that he had a right to insist upon the payments cannot alter the fact that under the agreement of September 16th, 1936, it is clear that he had no such right. In order to protect its position under the option agreement and to secure title to the lands which it was under obligation to transfer to the incorporated company, the Syndicate was under a practical compulsion to make the payments in question and is entitled to their repayment. The appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Parkinson, Gardiner & Willis.\nSolicitor for the respondents: A.V. Waters.\n[1] [1940] Ont.

The clauses in question of the will are set out in the reasons for judgment in this Court, now reported. The questions asked on the motion were:\n(i) Who is entitled to the income from the said sum of $7,000?\n(ii) Should the executors have set aside and invested the said sum of $7,000 out of the assets of the estate of the said deceased in securities authorized by law for trust funds for the benefit of the said Thomas Barton?\n(iii) If the said Thomas Barton is entitled to the said income, to what rate of interest is he entitled in the event of it being shown that the executors have failed to establish a satisfactory trust fund and from what date should said interest commence to run?\nThe order of Hogg J., affirmed by the Court of Appeal, declared:\nthat the said Thomas Barton is entitled to receive on his attaining the age of twenty-five years interest upon the bequest to him in the said will contained of $7,000 to be computed at the legal rate of interest and commencing from the date of the death of the testator, the said Willerton Barton, deceased, less such sums, if any, as shall have been paid out in the meantime by the executrices for his maintenance and education.\nC.L. Fraser for the appellant.\nN.N. Wardlaw for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Davis and Taschereau JJ. was delivered by\nDAVIS J.\u2014Willerton Barton, late of the Township of York, in the County of York, gardener, deceased, died on September 30th, 1930. His grandson, Thomas Barton, had been born on June 13th, 1919. By his last will, made April 20th, 1928, Willerton Barton made a bequest to his grandson, Thomas Barton, in the following words:\nI give and bequeath to my grandson, Thomas Barton, the sum of Seven thousand dollars, when he shall attain the age of twenty-five years; Provided that my Executor, Executrices and Trustees may advance to my said grandson such of the income from the said bequest as may be necessary for his maintenance and education prior to his attaining the age of twenty-five years.\nLater in the will occur these provisions:\nProvided that in the event of the death of my said grandson leaving no wife or child or children him surviving, before the period of distribution, then the share of my said grandson shall fall into the residue of my estate.\nProvided that in the event of the death of my said grandson before the period of distribution, leaving a wife or a wife and child or children him surviving, then the share of such grandson so dying shall be divided equally amongst the said wife and child or children, if any. The grandson, Thomas Barton, is living but will not attain the age of 25 years until June, 1944. The question raised on an application for the construction of the will is whether the gift to him vested on the date of the testator\u2019s death, which would involve the accretion of income, or whether the gift is merely a contingent gift, in which case the grandson on attaining 25 years would not be entitled to the intermediate income. I think upon the language of the will itself it is plain that the testator intended the income to go with the legacy. The words providing for maintenance and education out of \u201csuch of the income from the said bequest as may be necessary\u201d prior to the grandson attaining the age of 25 years are not to be construed as a separate and distinct gift of maintenance, having no effect on the question of vesting. See the judgment of Sir George Jessel, M.R., in Fox v. Fox[2].\nThe reasons for the judgment of the Court of Appeal which were written by Mr. Justice Riddell[3], are quite sufficient in themselves, if I may say so with great respect, to justify the dismissal of this appeal from that judgment. But it may be added that, as a matter of construction, the gift over in the event of the grandson not attaining 25 years of age may in itself indicate an early vesting in view of the judgment of Mr. Justice Farwell in In re Heath[4]; see 55 Law Notes (1936), p. 89.\nKERWIN J.\u2014The will of the testator, Willerton Barton, contained the following clauses:\u2014\nI give and bequeath to my grandson, Thomas Barton, the sum of Seven thousand dollars, when he shall attain the age of twenty-five years; Provided that My Executor, Executrices and Trustees may advance to my said grandson such of the income from the said bequest as may be necessary for his maintenance and education prior to his attaining the age of twenty-five years.\n* * *\nProvided that in the event of the death of my said grandson leaving no wife or child or children him surviving, before the period of distribution, then the share of my said grandson shall fall into the residue of my estate.\nProvided that in the event of the death of my said grandson before the period of distribution, leaving a wife or a wife and child or children him surviving, then the share of such grandson so dying shall be divided equally amongst the said wife and child or children, if any. His wife had the use of the residue of the estate, real and personal, for her own use during her life. The question is whether the legacy of $7,000 vested in the grandson at the death of the testator, subject to being divested if he should die before attaining the age of twenty-five, i.e., going to his wife and child or children, or, failing them, falling into the residue of the estate. If this related to real estate, the question is settled by authority, Phipps v. Ackers[5], and the reason for the rule is stated to be that if there is a gift over upon death under the stated age, the gift over shows that the first devisee is to take whatever interest the person claiming under the devise over is not entitled to, that is to say, the immediate interest. Halsbury, 2nd edition, vol. 34, p. 381.\nIn Bickersteth v. Shanu[6], the Judicial Committee saw no reason to doubt\nthat the established rule for the guidance of the court in construing devises of real estate is that they are to be held to be vested unless a condition precedent to the vesting is expressed with reasonable clearness.\nThe same rule, I think, is a proper one to be applied in construing bequests of personal estate.\nThe rule in Phipps v. Ackers5 was held applicable to gifts of both realty and personalty, Whitter v. Bremridge[7], and I agree with Farwell J. in In re Heath[8], that the rule applies to personalty.\nThe order of the Court of first instance, affirmed by the Court of Appeal, declared:\u2014\nthat the said Thomas Barton is entitled to receive on his attaining the age of twenty-five years interest upon the bequest to him in the said Will contained of $7,000 to be computed at the legal rate of interest and commencing from the date of the death of the testator, the said Willerton Barton, deceased, less such sums, if any, as shall have been paid out in the meantime by the executrices for his maintenance and education.\nI am satisfied that this is the correct order, and the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nHUDSON J.\u2014I agree with the decision of the Court of Appeal. The language of the will itself makes it clear that it was the testator\u2019s intention that his grandson should take a vested interest in the bequest to him and should have the income as well as the principal on his attaining the age of twenty-five years. There is severance of the legacy from the rest of the estate, there is a reference in the succeeding three paragraphs to \u201call the residue of my estate,\u201d and there is provision that the executors may advance the grandson such of the income \u201cfrom the said bequest\u201d as may be necessary for his maintenance and education prior to his attaining the age of twenty-five years.\nThe authorities support this construction: see Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England, 2nd edition, vol. 34, page 380; Phipps v. Ackers[9]; and In re Heath[10].\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: C. Lorne Fraser.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Norman N.

Under rule 55 of the rules and regulations of the Law Society of Alberta, the chairman of the discipline committee is authorized to appoint an investigating committee to hear a charge of conduct unbecoming a barrister or solicitor against a member of the Society.\nHarris v. Law Society of Alberta ([1936] S.C.R. 88) dist.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], affirming the judgment of the trial judge, Shepherd J., and dismissing an action by the appellant, a disbarred barrister, for a declaration that he was still a member of the respondent Society.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the judgments now reported.\nR. D. Tighe K.C. for the appellant.\nE. W. S. Kane for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2014The rule ought to be read and construed with a view to giving effect to the plainly declared intention that an Investigating Committee shall be named. The rule should receive an interpretation reasonably calculated to effect its purpose. I think the construction adopted is an admissible construction and that the appeal should be dismissed.\nThe judgment of Crocket, Hudson and Taschereau JJ. was delivered by\nHUDSON J.\u2014In this action the plaintiff alleges that the defendant Society, wrongfully and without legal right, ordered his name to be struck off the rolls of the Society, and he claims a declaration that he is still a member of the Society in good standing and entitled to practise as a solicitor and barrister in Alberta. At the trial before Mr. Justice Shepherd the action was dismissed and this decision was confirmed by the court of appeal, Mr. Justice Lunney dissenting.\nThe material facts are as follows: The plaintiff was practising as a solicitor and barrister in Alberta. On the 9th May, 1928, a complaint was lodged with the secretary of the Society, charging him with unprofessional conduct. In due course the appellant was notified of this complaint and asked for an explanation. He did send in an explanation which the chairman of the Discipline Committee of the Society thought insufficient and thereupon instructed the secretary of the Society that the matter should go to investigation in the usual way. Thereafter the chairman of the Discipline Committee, by letter dated November 25th, 1928, fixed the 10th December following, at the Court House, Edmonton, as the time and place for the hearing of the complaint, and named an Investigating Committee, composed of three benchers, to hear the same.\nThe appellant was duly notified of this hearing and on December 10th appeared personally and by counsel on further adjourned hearings on December 28th, 1928, and January 2nd, 1929. The appellant was duly notified that the report of the Investigating Committee would be presented to Convocation of the Benchers of the respondent Society at Calgary on 3rd January, and was informed that he had a right to be present or to have counsel or agent present to make such representation as he might deem necessary. A report of the Investigating Committee with the evidence and record of proceedings was duly presented to Convocation on the 3rd of January, and thereafter the following motion was passed unanimously:\nThat Convocation having considered the report of the Investigating Committee, the evidence taken before it and the record of proceedings, that the report of the said Committee be received and adopted and that the said James A. McCaffry be found guilty of conduct unbecoming a barrister and solicitor.\nand the following resolution was then passed:\nThat the name of James A. McCaffry be struck off the roll of the Law Society of Alberta.\nThe plaintiff was duly notified of this resolution and appealed therefrom to the court of appeal but such appeal was dismissed, apparently on the ground that the Court had no jurisdiction. There is nothing in the case to indicate that the question now under consideration was raised, but I can see no reason why it should not have been raised. The appellant now claims that he did not know that the members of the Investigating Committee had been appointed by the chairman of the Discipline Committee until long after the appeal; but when he launched his appeal to the court of appeal he must have had the report of the Investigating Committee which, on its face, did show by whom the Committee had been appointed.\nOn several occasions thereafter plaintiff applied for reinstatement but his applications were refused.\nThere is not and, indeed, from the record it does not appear that there could be any charge of unfairness about the mode of procedure or lack of opportunity for the plaintiff to present any defence that he might have before the Investigating Committee or the benchers in Convocation.\nThe Legal Profession Act with amendments to the date of the hearing of the complaint against the appellant provided: 31. The benchers may from time to time make rules and regulations in respect of the following matters, that is to say:\n(a) The government of the said society and other purposes connected therewith, including the determination of or adjudication upon any matter or thing which it is the duty of the benchers or any committee thereof to adjudicate upon or determine.\n* * *\nProvided that all rules and regulations of the Law Society of the North-West Territories in force upon the fifteenth day of March, one thousand nine hundred and seven, shall mutatis mutandis constitute the rules and regulations of the society, until and except in so far as they shall be repealed or amended by the benchers.\n32.(1) Any three benchers thereunto authorized in accordance with the rules and regulations of the society shall constitute an Investigating Committee and such committee may investigate whether any member of the society has been guilty of conduct unbecoming a barrister or solicitor and the said committee may also investigate any other matter or thing that might form the subject matter of a charge or complain against the member of the Law Society whose conduct is being investigated that shall arise in the course of the said investigation, and may report thereon to the benchers, as hereinafter provided.\nRules and regulations were adopted by the benchers, taking effect January 7th, 1927. Rules 54, 55 and 56 dealt with discipline and Rule 55 is the pertinent one in so far as this appeal is concerned. It provides:\nUpon receipt of a complaint against any member of the Society for unprofessional conduct, the Secretary of the Society shall submit the same to the Chairman of the Discipline Committee, and if instructed so to do by such Chairman, shall proceed to formulate a charge in conformity with the facts complained of and shall then forward the charge to the member complained of with a request for his explanation, and shall fix a time for answering. If within the period fixed for answer, none is received, or if received, the answer does not in the opinion of the Chairman of the Discipline Committee suffice to clear the member complained of, a place and time shall be fixed by him for hearing the said charge and an Investigating Committee named, and the matter shall thereupon proceed to a hearing according to the provisions of The Legal Profession Act as in force from time to time.\nApart from, this, there is no evidence of any written rule or regulation of the benchers, but it does appear that from the year 1927 onwards the practice had been for the chairman of the Discipline Committee to name the members of any investigating Committee that became necessary. That this course had been adopted in the present case was shown by the report of the Investigating Committee itself which was adopted by the benchers on the 3rd January. Although Rule 55 is not clear and specific, I think it is fairly open to the interpretations thus adopted by the benchers and, in view of the fact that the benchers themselves constituted the body which had power to make these regulations, I do not think that their action in the matter should now be disturbed.\nThe decision of this Court in the case of Harris v. Law Society of Alberta[2] was relied on by counsel for the appellant and forms the basis of the dissenting judgment of Mr. Justice Lunney in the court below. The relevant statute of Alberta in force then was quite different from that which applies to the present case. Moreover, it appears that the Court was of the opinion that Harris never had an opportunity of putting his case fully before the Discipline Committee or the benchers in convocation. In the present case, the appellant had ample opportunity of doing so before the Committee and the Benchers. Then, the provision for appeal applicable in the Harris case(1) referred to an appeal from the Discipline Committee as well as from the benchers; but under the statute now in force, section 32 (15), the appeal is from the order of the Benchers and not from the Discipline Committee. This, I think, indicates that it was intended by the Legislature that the decision of the Benchers should be the final decision in the matter, subject only to the right of appeal as provided for in section 32 (15). For these reasons, I think the appeal should be dismissed, but with costs if demanded.\nKERWIN J.\u2014The appellant sued for a declaration that he was still a member of the Law Society of Alberta and entitled to exercise and enjoy all the rights and privileges of a barrister and solicitor and a member of the Law Society. The action was dismissed and an appeal to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta was dismissed.\nBy The Legal Profession Act, R.S.A., 1922, chapter 206, the Law Society of Alberta is to be governed by a body composed of members of the Society, to be designated benchers. By section 31:\u2014\nThe benchers may from time to time make rules and regulations in respect of the following matters, that is to say:\n(a) The government of the said society and other purposes connected therewith. A new section 32 was enacted in 1924 and as that section was in force when the benchers made certain rules and regulations, it is important to note subsections 1 and 2:\u2014\n32.(1) Any three benchers meeting together as such shall constitute an investigating committee of the society and may investigate under oath any written charge or complaint that a member of the society has been guilty of conduct unbecoming a barrister or solicitor, or has made default in the payment of moneys received by him as a barrister or solicitor, or has been guilty of such misconduct as in England would have been sufficient to bring a solicitor under the punitive powers of the Supreme Court of Judicature, or has been guilty of any breach of the provisions of this Act or of any rules and regulations of the society made or passed under the authority of this Act.\n(2) At least ten days' notice in writing shall be given by the secretary of the society to such member of the intention of an investigating committee of three benchers as aforesaid to investigate the said charge or complaint and such notice shall specify the charge or complaint to be investigated and the time and place at which such investigation will be held and shall be served upon such member by being enclosed in a sealed prepaid and registered envelope addressed and mailed to such member at his last post office address on the books of the society.\nThe rules and regulations took effect January 7th, 1927. Under rule 20, a standing committee known as the discipline committee is to be selected at the first convocation of benchers following the regular election. By rule 53:\u2014\nthe discipline committee shall be charged with the supervision of the exercise of the disciplinary powers of the Society.\nRules 54 and 55 as so enacted are as follows:\u2014\nRule 54. The Secretary shall from time to time report in writing to the Chairman of the Discipline Committee all complaints against a member of the Society which come to his notice, whether orally or in writing, other than charges ordered by the Benchers to be investigated. Wherever possible, the Secretary shall, before making such report, obtain a complaint in writing.\nRule 55. Upon receipt of a complaint against any member of the Society for unprofessional conduct the Secretary of the Society shall submit the same to the Chairman of the Discipline Committee, and if instructed so to do by such Chairman shall proceed to formulate a charge in conformity with the facts complained of and shall then forward the charge to the member complained of with a request for his explanation, and shall fix a time for answering. If within the period fixed for answer, none is received, or if received, the answer does not in the opinion of the Chairman of the Discipline Committee suffice to clear the member complained of, a place and time shall be fixed by him for hearing the said charge and an Investigating Committee named and the matter shall thereupon proceed to a hearing according to the provisions of The Legal Profession Act as in force from time to time.\nIt is argued that under subsection 1 of section 32 of the Act as enacted in 1924 only the benchers could appoint an investigating committee and that they had no authority to delegate that power to anyone. If that be so, it is then argued that subsection 1 of section 32 as enacted in 1928 (assented to March 21st but by virtue of a general Act not to come into force until July 1st) could not affect the matter even if its terms were sufficiently wide. It is also contended that on its true construction rule 55 does not purport to authorize the Chairman of the Discipline Committee to appoint the three members of the Investigating Committee.\nOn July 4th, 1928, the benchers amended the first part of Rule 55 but the amendment is of no importance. It was after this date that the chairman of the Discipline Committee nominated the members of the Investigating Committee and that the investigation occurred. I have come to the conclusion that the 1924 Act did not require the whole body of benchers to appoint the three members of an investigating committee, nor did it contemplate any three benchers meeting together and constituting themselves such a committee. I am of opinion that under clause (a) of section 31 (which was also amended in 1928 but not so as to affect the present question), and under ss. 1 of s. 32 as enacted in 1924, the benchers had power to direct that the chairman of the Discipline Committee should nominate the members of an Investigating Committee. The construction of rule 55 is not easy but on this point I have come to the conclusion that the rule carries into effect the power which I believe was possessed by the benchers.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs, if demanded.\nAppeal dismissed with costs if demanded.\n[1] [1941] 1 D.L.R. 213.\n[2] [1936] S.C.H. 88.\n",

Dans le mois d'ao\u00fbt de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e, la compagnie appelante soumissionna pour cette construction, mais pour une raison ou pour une autre, les parties n'ont pas donn\u00e9 suite \u00e0 leurs n\u00e9gociations et l'immeuble n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 construit.\nEn juillet 1928, l'intim\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 incorpor\u00e9e par lettres patentes \u00e9mises par le Lieutenant-Gouverneur de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, et M.

La lettre se lit de la fa\u00e7on suivante:\u2014 Hill-Clark-Francis, Limited\nNoranda, Que.\nJuly 14th, 1928.\nR. M. Elliott, Esq.,\nc\/o Northland Grocers,\nNoranda, Que.\nDear Sir:\u2014\nThis will confirm our verbal offer for construction of your Warehouse Building at Noranda on cost plus basis, remuneration to be 10% on cost. Our estimated cost of $12,300.00 to be the outside cost on building as shown on our plan of June 30th, 1928. In accordance with your instructions we are altering the size of this to 50 x 70 and estimate that the addition will bring the cost to about $14,000.00 plus the added cost for extra radiation and electric light. The vault door is included in our estimate, for which we have allowed $130.00 in place. We have not included the elevator in our estimate as we understand you now propose using the electric one.\nIn reference to excavation. We are presuming that we will strike clay or other solid earth for footings at a depth as shown on our plan. Should the black muck extend to a greater depth than this it will be necessary to excavate to solid footing and backfill with stone or other material to bring basement floor and footings to a level where they may be drained to the sewers. This is absolutely necessary in order to ensure a dry cellar. Should we have to go to any great depth in order to get solid earth for footings the backfilling with earth and rock would increase our cost to an extent where we would have to ask for extra money.\nWe trust that the above meets with your approval and would appreciate a written confirmation of your verbal orders, to go ahead with construction along these lines.\nPayments to be made monthly up to 85% of value of material delivered on job, plus labour charges incurred. Balance of 15% will be a holdback until completion of contract.\nYours truly,\nHill-Clark-Francis, Limited,\nPer: W. J.

Cette diff\u00e9rence de niveau alla en s'accentuant jusqu'en 1931, date o\u00f9 l'intim\u00e9e quitta les lieux pour continuer son commerce ailleurs. Depuis ce temps, jusqu'au jour o\u00f9 Gamble-Robinson prit possession des lieux lou\u00e9s, l'immeuble ne f\u00fbt pas occup\u00e9 et les d\u00e9gradations all\u00e8rent en s'accentuant, tellement que durant l'occupation des locataires la diff\u00e9rence de niveau a atteint dix-neuf pouces au printemps de 1933, et vingt-trois pouces au mois de novembre de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e. La ligne perpendiculaire s'\u00e9loignait de quatorze pouces de l'immeuble au niveau du sol. Croyant au d\u00e9but qu'il ne s'agissait que d'un tassement normal, l'intim\u00e9e r\u00e9alisa bient\u00f4t que la perte de l'immeuble devenait imminente, et \u00e9crivit \u00e0 l'appelante le 6 novembre 1933 pour la mettre en demeure, mais celle-ci refusa de reconna\u00eetre sa responsabilit\u00e9. L'intim\u00e9e fit alors faire des r\u00e9parations par un nomm\u00e9 Munro, \u00e9valu\u00e9es \u00e0 $4,877.68, et par son action elle r\u00e9clame cette somme, plus $7,000.00 de dommages pour d\u00e9pr\u00e9ciation \u00e0 l'immeuble. L'intim\u00e9e attribua la ruine partielle de l'entrep\u00f4t \u00e0 des vices du sol et \u00e0 des vices de construction. La Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a accord\u00e9 la somme r\u00e9clam\u00e9e, soit $11,877.68, mais la Cour du Banc du Roi a r\u00e9duit ce montant \u00e0 $4,877.68. Les deux parties en appellent devant cette Cour, l'appelante pour faire rejeter l'action totalement, et l'intim\u00e9e se portant contre-appelante veut faire r\u00e9tablir le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure.\nL'intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend fonder son recours sur les articles 1683 et 1688 du Code Civil. Ces articles se lisent de la fa\u00e7on suivante:\u2014\n1683. Lorsque quelqu'un entreprend la construction d'une b\u00e2tisse ou autre ouvrage par devis et march\u00e9, il peut \u00eatre convenu ou qu'il fournira son travail et son industrie seulement, ou qu'il fournira aussi les mat\u00e9riaux.\n1688. Si l'\u00e9difice p\u00e9rit en tout ou en partie dans les (cinq) ans, par le vice de la construction ou m\u00eame par le vice du sol, l'architecte qui surveille l'ouvrage et l'entrepreneur sont responsables de la perte conjointement et solidairement.\nLa pr\u00e9tention de l'appelante est qu'il ne s'agit pas d'un contrat d'ouvrage par devis et march\u00e9s, mais bien d'un simple louage de services vu que l'intim\u00e9e avait conserv\u00e9 la direction des travaux. Elle all\u00e8gue en outre que les dommages \u00e0 l'immeuble doivent \u00eatre attribu\u00e9s aux conditions et \u00e0 la nature du sol qui, \u00e0 cet endroit, est exceptionnelle et telle, qu'il est impossible de pr\u00e9voir les dommages qui peuvent \u00eatre occasionn\u00e9s aux immeubles nouveaux; que l'intim\u00e9e connaissait la nature du sol; qu'elle a accept\u00e9 le risque d'une construction \u00e0 cet endroit; que le sol a \u00e9t\u00e9 l'objet de perturbations souterraines dues aux op\u00e9rations mini\u00e8res de la Noranda, alors qu'une quantit\u00e9 consid\u00e9rable d'eau a \u00e9t\u00e9 tir\u00e9e du sous-sol et s'est \u00e9coul\u00e9e dans les galeries de cette compagnie mini\u00e8re, faisant ainsi s'effondrer le sol. Elle all\u00e8gue aussi que ce dommage \u00e0 l'immeuble est d\u00fb \u00e0 la conduite de l'intim\u00e9e elle-m\u00eame qui a surcharg\u00e9 son immeuble, ne l'a pas chauff\u00e9 durant une saison d'hiver et que la structure elle-m\u00eame de l'immeuble a \u00e9t\u00e9 affaiblie par des changements ordonn\u00e9s par M. Elliott lui-m\u00eame. Enfin, l'action serait prescrite par cinq ans \u00e0 cause des dispositions de l'article 2259 du Code Civil.\nAfin de bien d\u00e9terminer la nature de la responsabilit\u00e9 dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, il importe de se demander en premier lieu s'il s'agit d'un louage d'ouvrage tel que le pr\u00e9tend l'appelante, ou s'il ne s'agit pas plut\u00f4t d'un contrat d'ouvrage par devis et march\u00e9s, dont l'essence est l'entreprise, entra\u00eenant l'application des articles 1683 et 1688. La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le, et c'est ainsi \u00e9galement que l'ont interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et la Cour du Banc du Roi, que c'est bien l'appelante qui avait la direction des travaux ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s suivant des plans accept\u00e9s au pr\u00e9alable. L'appelante engageait ses propres hommes, exer\u00e7ait sur eux un contr\u00f4le absolu sans intervention de l'intim\u00e9e. Elle fournissait la main-d'\u0153uvre, la machinerie, et devait ex\u00e9cuter tous les travaux suivant les plans pr\u00e9par\u00e9s au pr\u00e9alable, ou subs\u00e9quemment modifi\u00e9s et accept\u00e9s de part et d'autre. Il est vrai que l'intim\u00e9e a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 des changements, mais ceci ne peut avoir aucun effet sur le caract\u00e8re du contrat d'entreprise. Des modifications dans les plans ne changent pas la nature du contrat intervenu. Le contr\u00f4le de l'ex\u00e9cution des travaux \u00e9tait sous la juridiction exclusive de l'appelante, et sa pr\u00e9tention \u00e0 l'effet que Elliott en avait gard\u00e9 le contr\u00f4le, n'est pas fond\u00e9e. Au contraire, il est prouv\u00e9 que Elliott ne se rendait sur les lieux qu'accidentellement, et n'intervenait que pour demander des changements que d\u00e9siraient avoir ses principaux.\nLa distinction entre le contrat de louage de services et le contrat d'ouvrage par devis et march\u00e9s a souvent \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par les auteurs et par nos tribunaux. Signalons en premier lieu Fr\u00e9my-Ligneville\u2014L\u00e9gislation des B\u00e2timents\u2014tome 1:\u2014 Les devis et march\u00e9s en mati\u00e8re de construction sont, dans un sens g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, les conventions qui interviennent entre le propri\u00e9taire qui veut faire construire et les contracteurs, pour r\u00e9gler d'avance et avec pr\u00e9cision le mode suivant lequel la construction voulue sera ex\u00e9cut\u00e9e et pay\u00e9e.\nBaudry-Lacantinerie, 3\u00e8me \u00e9dition, vol. 22, n\u00b0 3865:\u2014\nLe crit\u00e9rium sert \u00e0 distinguer le louage de gens de travail du louage d'entrepreneurs d'ouvrages. Dans le premier, comme le supposent la d\u00e9finition du code et les textes, le ma\u00eetre a la direction du travail; le domestique, l'ouvrier ou l'employ\u00e9 a engag\u00e9 son activit\u00e9 et se trouve vis-\u00e0-vis du ma\u00eetre dans un lien de subordination. Dans le second, au contraire, le ma\u00eetre a simplement command\u00e9 un travail d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que l'entrepreneur fait sans aucune direction et qu'il remet une fois termin\u00e9.\nCette Cour, dans une cause de Qu\u00e9bec Asbestos Corporation vs. G\u00e9d\u00e9on Couture[2], a donn\u00e9 sur cette question des pr\u00e9cisions claires. Parlant au nom de la Cour, M. le juge Rinfret s'est exprim\u00e9 de la fa\u00e7on suivante:\u2014\nOr, nous sommes d'avis que c'est bien l\u00e0 la nature juridique du contrat qu'il avait fait avec la compagnie. On y trouve les principaux caract\u00e8res distinctifs du contrat d'entreprise: le mode adopt\u00e9 pour sa r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration; le droit de choisir les hommes qu'il employait, de fixer leur salaire, de les diriger et de les renvoyer; la responsabilit\u00e9 en dommages comme cons\u00e9quence de son d\u00e9faut d'alimenter l'usine; surtout l'absence d'un lien de subordination entre Couture et la compagnie et son ind\u00e9pendance dans la m\u00e9thode de travail.\nLe contrat de louage d'ouvrage se distingue du contrat d'entreprise surtout par le caract\u00e8re de subordination qu'il attribue \u00e0 l'employ\u00e9. M\u00eame pay\u00e9s \u00e0 la t\u00e2che, les ouvriers peuvent \u00eatre \"des locateurs de services, s'ils sont subordonn\u00e9s \u00e0 un patron; mais au contraire les ouvriers sont des entrepreneurs, s'ils ne sont pas soumis \u00e0 cette subordination.\"\nC'est bien le cas qui se pr\u00e9sente dans la cause actuelle. L'appelante avait le droit de choisir les hommes qu'elle employait, de fixer leur salaire, de les diriger et de les renvoyer. C'est elle qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 responsable en dommages vis-\u00e0-vis ses employ\u00e9s ou pour l'acte de l'un de ses employ\u00e9s, et il n'y avait aucun lien de subordination entre l'appelante et l'intim\u00e9e, et il existait une ind\u00e9pendance compl\u00e8te dans la m\u00e9thode de travail. Il est bon de noter de plus, qu'en vertu des dispositions de l'article 1683 du Code Civil, il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire que le prix soit fix\u00e9 d'avance, et cette absence de prix fixe n'emp\u00eache pas le contrat d'\u00eatre un contrat d'entreprise. Il ne faut pas confondre les dispositions de cet article de notre Code avec les dispositions du Code Napol\u00e9on o\u00f9 un prix doit n\u00e9cessairement \u00eatre fix\u00e9 d'avance, tel que le veut l'article 1792 C.N. qui se lit de la fa\u00e7on suivante:\u2014 Si l'\u00e9difice construit \u00e0 prix fait p\u00e9rit en tout ou en partie par le vice de la construction, m\u00eame par le vice du sol, les architectes et entrepreneurs en sont responsables pendant dix ans.\nC'est d'ailleurs l'enseignement de M. Mignault, Vol. 7, page 400:\u2014\nG\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, le march\u00e9 fixe d'avance la somme pr\u00e9cise que le ma\u00eetre devra payer, et alors ont dit que l'ouvrage est entreprise \u00e0 prix fait, ou \u00e0 forfait. Cependant, cette d\u00e9termination du prix n'est pas de l'essence du louage d'ouvrage par devis et march\u00e9s, car il peut \u00eatre stipul\u00e9 que le propri\u00e9taire paiera le prix des mat\u00e9riaux et de la main-d'\u0153uvre avec une bonification de tant pour cent qui constitue le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de l'entrepreneur.\nL'appelante a soumis \u00e9galement qu'il ne pouvait pas s'agir d'un contrat d'entreprise, entra\u00eenant la responsabilit\u00e9 pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l'article 1688 C.C., parce qu'il n'y avait pas de sp\u00e9cifications attach\u00e9es aux plans. Tr\u00e8s souvent, \u00e9videmment, ces sp\u00e9cifications qui compl\u00e8tent les plans existent, surtout lorsqu'ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9s par un architecte ; elles servent \u00e0 d\u00e9tailler ces m\u00eames plans, et \u00e0 indiquer, d'une fa\u00e7on plus claire, quelle sera la nature et le genre du travail \u00e0 accomplir. Mais, elles ne sont pas toujours n\u00e9cessaires, et un contrat d'entreprise peut \u00eatre complet sans qu'elles se rencontrent, surtout comme dans le cas actuel o\u00f9 l'entrepreneur connaissait le travail \u00e0 accomplir, et o\u00f9 des plans suffisamment pr\u00e9cis n'avaient pas besoin de d\u00e9tails suppl\u00e9mentaires. C'est d'ailleurs la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle en vient l'honorable Juge Bond qui, en Cour du Banc du Roi, a rendu le jugement unanime de la Cour.\nLa pr\u00e9tention de l'appelante, qu'il s'agit d'un contrat de louage de services, ne peut donc pas \u00eatre accept\u00e9e, et il faut en venir \u00e0 la conclusion que le pr\u00e9sent litige doit \u00eatre jug\u00e9 \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des articles 1683. et 1688 C.C. Il n'y a pas de doute que l'\u00e9difice a p\u00e9ri en partie dans les cinq ans de la fin des travaux. Ceux-ci ont \u00e9t\u00e9 termin\u00e9s vers la fin de 1928. Les dommages se sont manifest\u00e9s en 1929, 1930, 1931, 1932, 1933, etc. Le constructeur est responsable des vices de construction et des vices du sol, et il existe contre lui une pr\u00e9somption de faute qui a fait l'objet de commentaires nombreux devant les tribunaux canadiens et du Conseil Priv\u00e9. Sans qu'il soit n\u00e9cessaire de faire l'historique de toute la jurisprudence sur ce point, rappelons cette tr\u00e8s ancienne cause de Brown et Laurie, jug\u00e9e par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure de Montr\u00e9al en 1851 (1). Dans cette cause, jug\u00e9e cependant avant l'entr\u00e9e en vigueur du Code Civil et avant par cons\u00e9quent l'existence de l'article 1688, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que le constructeur est responsable des vices du sol, malgr\u00e9 que les excavations aient \u00e9t\u00e9 faites suivant les plans et devis et sous la direction d'un architecte employ\u00e9 par le propri\u00e9taire. La Cour du Banc de la Reine a confirm\u00e9 cette d\u00e9cision[3], et M. le Juge Panet s'exprime, \u00e0 la page 68, de fa\u00e7on suivante:\u2014\nPour ma part j'irais m\u00eame plus loin que l'honorable pr\u00e9sident de la Cour; son opinion est bas\u00e9e sur le fait que la perte \u00e9tait prouv\u00e9e \u00eatre la cons\u00e9quence du vice du sol; suivant moi cette preuve n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire, et le constructeur est responsable de tous les vices qui peuvent se rencontrer, et qu'il ne prouve pas provenir de force majeure ou du fait m\u00eame du propri\u00e9taire. Ici l'entrepreneur n'a pas pris les pr\u00e9cautions n\u00e9cessaires, et il est cons\u00e9quemment responsable.\nDans la cause de Wardle vs. Bethune, jug\u00e9e par le Conseil Priv\u00e9 en 1872 (3), il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'un contracteur est responsable de l'enfoncement d'un immeuble construit par lui-m\u00eame.\nMalgr\u00e9 que l'immeuble qui faisait l'objet du litige dans Wardle vs. Bethune[4] avait \u00e9t\u00e9 construit en 1862, avant l'existence du Code Civil, on a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l'article 1688 C.C. n'introduisait pas du droit nouveau dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, mais \u00e9tait d\u00e9clamatoire du droit existant et le Conseil Priv\u00e9 a dit:\u2014\nWhen there has been a breach of warranty of the stability of the building, the onus is on the builder to show that he is exempted from liability, by some exception in his favour. It is of primary importance that he should make sure of the sufficiency of the foundation on which he proceeds to build, for, without a sufficient foundation, the warranty could not be kept. It is an inseparable incident, an essential part of the warranty; the warranty of stability of the edifice, includes by necessary implication, the warranty of sufficiency of foundation; and such is the law as explained in Brown vs. Laurie[5]. The architect and builder are therefore bound to provide whatever is essential to the stability warranted.\nThe exemption from responsibility, on the part of the builder, for the breach of warranty, must be made out (if at all) by legaal implication. There is not in the Code any express exception in favour of the builder; and there is none in his contract.\nNous d\u00e9sirons r\u00e9f\u00e9rer \u00e9galement \u00e0 la cause de Protestant Board School Commissioners of the City of Montreal vs. Quintan[6], et Canadian Electric Light Company vs. Pringle[7], o\u00f9 M. le juge Carroll s'exprime ainsi:\u2014 Les auteurs fran\u00e7ais discutent beaucoup sur la preuve que l'architecte et l'ing\u00e9nieur civil doivent produire pour se lib\u00e9rer. Les uns disent que l'onus probandi leur incombe, les autres disent que c'est au propri\u00e9taire \u00e0 prouver la faute, d'apr\u00e8s les r\u00e8gles du droit commun. Il me semble plus rationnel que l'architecte et l'ing\u00e9nieur soient oblig\u00e9s de prouver absence de faute de leur part. Ce sont des hommes de l'art; ils sont plus \u00e0 m\u00eame que le propri\u00e9taire de conna\u00eetre les d\u00e9fectuosit\u00e9s de l'\u00e9difice qu'ils construisent, ils sont en meilleure posture pour prouver que leur plan et leur travail sont parfaits. Comment un propri\u00e9taire, ignorant des connaissances techniques n\u00e9cessaires, peut-il faire la preuve de la faute d'un ing\u00e9nieur civil ou d'un architecte? D'ailleurs, cette question me semble r\u00e9gl\u00e9e d\u00e9finitivement pour nous, par le jugement du Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans la cause de Wardle v. Bethune (3) o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le fardeau de la preuve incombait au constructeur et cons\u00e9quemment \u00e0 l'architecte. Je r\u00e9f\u00e8re les parties \u00e0 cette cause.\nLe m\u00eame principe a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu de nouveau par cette Cour dans Canadian Consolidated Rubber Co. v. Pringle & Son Ltd. and The Foundation Company Ltd.[8].\nIl n'y a donc pas de doute que le propri\u00e9taire de l'immeuble n'a pas besoin de prouver la faute du constructeur lorsqu'il s'agit d'un contrat d'entreprise, mais qu'il appartient \u00e0 celui-ci de se lib\u00e9rer de sa responsabilit\u00e9 en prouvant que le dommage est attribuable soit, \u00e0 la force majeure, \u00e0 un cas fortuit, \u00e0 la faute du propri\u00e9taire, ou \u00e0 l'acte d'un tiers.\nL'appelante n'a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 \u00e9tablir l'existence de l'une ou de plusieurs de ces exceptions qui, seules, pourraient la soustraire \u00e0 l'application rigoureuse de l'article 1688 C.C.\nIl ne peut \u00eatre question de force majeure. Il n'y a pas eu davantage de cas fortuit, dont l'occurrence impr\u00e9vue aurait pu justifier l'appelante. Celle-ci connaissait bien en effet la nature du sol, et si l'on relit le dernier paragraphe de la lettre de juillet 1928, on voit facilement qu'elle r\u00e9alisait pleinement le genre de travail qu'il y avait \u00e0 accomplir, et les difficult\u00e9s probables qu'elle aurait \u00e0 rencontrer. Voici ce qu'elle \u00e9crivait \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e:\u2014\nIn reference to excavation. We are presuming that we will strike clay or other solid earth for footings at a depth as shown on our plan. Should the black muck extend to a greater depth than this it will be necessary to excavate to solid footing and backfill with stone or other material to bring basement floor and footings to a level where they may be drained to the sewers. This is absolutely necessary in order to ensure a dry cellar. Should we have to go to any great depth in order to get solid earth for footings the backfilling with earth and rock would increase our cost to an extent where we would have to ask for extra money. L'intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait pr\u00eate \u00e0 payer ce qu'on lui demandait pour que son immeuble repos\u00e2t sur des bases solides, et ne s'enfon\u00e7\u00e2t pas apr\u00e8s quelques ann\u00e9es dans un sol vaseux.\nIl n'est pas \u00e9tabli non plus que le propri\u00e9taire f\u00fbt en faute. L'all\u00e9gation que l'immeuble aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 surcharg\u00e9, ou n'aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 chauff\u00e9 durant un hiver, ne me para\u00eet pas justifi\u00e9e. Il n'est certes pas \u00e9tabli qu'il y ait eu de surcharge suffisante pour affecter le sol, et la preuve ne r\u00e9v\u00e8le nullement que l'absence de chaleur durant un certain temps ait caus\u00e9 des dommages si consid\u00e9rables, et surtout de la nature de ceux qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 constat\u00e9s. L'intim\u00e9e, enfin, n'a pas perdu son droit de r\u00e9clamer parce qu'elle aurait demand\u00e9 des modifications et des additions \u00e0 l'immeuble. Si l'appelante, comme tel est le cas, a accept\u00e9 de les ex\u00e9cuter, elle doit r\u00e9pondre des vices de construction et des faiblesses du sol.\nQuant \u00e0 cette autre pr\u00e9tention de l'intim\u00e9e que le sol se serait enfonc\u00e9 comme cons\u00e9quence des op\u00e9rations mini\u00e8res de la Noranda Mines, dont les fouilles souterraines auraient provoqu\u00e9 l'\u00e9coulement d'une grande quantit\u00e9 d'eau affaiblissant ainsi le sol o\u00f9 reposait l'immeuble, je crois qu'elle n'est pas suffisamment \u00e9tablie pour nous justifier de conclure que les dommages ont \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9s par la faute de cette compagnie. La preuve apport\u00e9e, malgr\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 l'audience elle m'ait impressionn\u00e9, n'a pas, je pense, la force probante n\u00e9cessaire pour placer l'appelante dans le cadre \u00e9troit de la derni\u00e8re exception que j'ai signal\u00e9e tout \u00e0 l'heure, et qui ferait dispara\u00eetre la responsabilit\u00e9 de l'appelante, soit l'acte d'un tiers. Il importait \u00e0 l'appelante d'\u00e9tablir ce moyen ; elle avait incontestablement le fardeau de cette preuve, et les t\u00e9moins qu'elle a fait entendre, comme d'ailleurs les conjectures de ses experts, sont contredits par la preuve de l'intim\u00e9e. C'est \u00e0 cette conclusion qu'en est arriv\u00e9 le juge de premi\u00e8re instance et je ne pense pas qu'il s'agisse de l'un de ces cas exceptionnels o\u00f9 cette Cour peut intervenir pour changer les conclusions de faits du juge qui a vu et entendu les t\u00e9moins.\nUn mot de la question de prescription invoqu\u00e9e dans les plaidoiries comme dernier moyen de d\u00e9fense. Avec raison, le procureur de l'appelante y a renonc\u00e9 lors de l'audience, car, il semble clair qu'au moment o\u00f9 l'action a \u00e9t\u00e9 institu\u00e9e, l'article 2259 C.C. ne pouvait trouver son application. Je crois donc, pour ces raisons, que le jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi est bien fond\u00e9, et que l'appel principal doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nIl reste la question du contre-appel. Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance, comme nous l'avons vu, a non seulement accord\u00e9 $4,877.68 pour r\u00e9parations \u00e0 l'immeuble, mais aussi la somme de $7,000.00 de dommages, que dans son jugement la Cour du Banc du Roi a retranch\u00e9e. La preuve a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que l'intim\u00e9e et contre-appelante avait lou\u00e9 pour une p\u00e9riode d'une ann\u00e9e et deux mois l'immeuble en question \u00e0 la Cie Gamble-Robinson et que pour la dur\u00e9e du bail, elle lui avait \u00e9galement accord\u00e9 le privil\u00e8ge d'acheter au prix de $20,000.00. Subs\u00e9quemment, la Cie Gamble-Robinson a refus\u00e9 de payer cette somme de $20,000.00 mais s'est d\u00e9clar\u00e9e dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 faire l'acquisition de cet immeuble pour la somme de $13,000.00, c'est-\u00e0-dire $7,000.00 de moins que le montant mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 la promesse de vente. Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a accept\u00e9 ce chiffre comme repr\u00e9sentant la d\u00e9pr\u00e9ciation de l'immeuble, mais la Cour du Banc du Roi en est venue \u00e0 la conclusion que cette preuve n'\u00e9tait pas suffisante. Cette m\u00e9thode, en effet, d'\u00e9tablir le dommage souffert par l'intim\u00e9e n'est pas satisfaisante. Le prix de $20,000.00 ne repr\u00e9sentait pas, au moment o\u00f9 l'option a \u00e9t\u00e9 consentie, la valeur r\u00e9elle de cet immeuble; et le montant de $13,000.00 n'est pas lui non plus une preuve de sa valeur au moment de la vente. Il est certain que l'immeuble a subi des dommages consid\u00e9rables, mais, avec respect, je suis d'opinion que la base adopt\u00e9e par le juge de premi\u00e8re instance \u00e9tait erron\u00e9e. Il y a cependant, dans la d\u00e9claration et dans la preuve, des \u00e9l\u00e9ments suffisants pour d\u00e9terminer des dommages sur une base diff\u00e9rente. L'intim\u00e9e et contre-appelante all\u00e8gue dans son action que les r\u00e9parations affectu\u00e9es, et pour lesquelles elle a pay\u00e9 la somme de $4,877.68, n'\u00e9taient pas compl\u00e8tes. Ce montant d\u00e9bours\u00e9 n'a servi qu'\u00e0 r\u00e9parer les fondations, mais l'immeuble lui-m\u00eame a subi des dommages, et il aurait fallu une somme additionnelle de $3,000.00 pour r\u00e9parer la structure et d'autres parties de l'entrep\u00f4t. Sur ce point, M. le juge Bond en vient \u00e0 la conclusion que la structure elle-m\u00eame a \u00e9t\u00e9 endommag\u00e9e, et dans son jugement il s'exprime de la fa\u00e7on suivante:\u2014\nNo further proof was adduced to support the alleged estimate by the purchaser of the sum of $3,000 to make repairs to the superstructure. While there seems reason to think that the superstructure was damaged, I have been unable to find in the record any evidence which would enable me to place any value on such damage, except upon a purely arbitrary basis, which would not be justified.\nJe partage son opinion quand il affirme qu'il y a eu des dommages. Cependant, en ce qui concerne la valeur de ces dommages, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 la preuve non contredite qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9, je ne puis avec respect concourir dans ses vues. Ce montant de $3,000.00 n'est certainement pas exag\u00e9r\u00e9 et je crois qu'il aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre accord\u00e9. Le contre-appel devrait donc \u00eatre maintenu jusqu'\u00e0 concurrence d'une somme de $3,000.00 avec int\u00e9r\u00eats depuis la signification de l'action et les d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed and cross-appeal maintained, with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Lucien Labette.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Vall\u00e9e, Fortier, L\u00e9tourneau and MacNaughton.\n[1] (1940) Q.R. 69 K.B. 281.\n[2] [1929] S.C.R. 166.\n[3] (1854) 5 L.C.R. 65.\n[4] (1872) 16 L.C.J. 85.\n[5] (1851) 1 L.C.R. 343.\n[6] (1920) Q.R. 30 K.B. 514.\n[7] (1919) Q.R. 29 K.B. 26, at 32.\n[8] [1930] S.C.R. 477.\n",

There had been a written agreement between appellant and each of respondents as to rates, but the agreements had expired prior to the enactment in 1940 of said clause (ii), and since said expiry the parties have not agreed upon the rates to be paid by respondents for the water, which appellant has continued to supply.\nRespondents each applied to the Board, pursuant to said clause (ii), to (vary or fix the rates for water supplied. Appellant applied to the Board for an order dismissing respondents\u2019 applications, on the ground that the Board has no authority or jurisdiction to hear and determine them, by reason of the provisions of the special Acts relating to appellant City and the powers vested in its council under such Acts. The Board dismissed appellant\u2019s application, and the dismissal was affirmed by the Court of Appeal for Ontario ([1940] O.W.N. 524; [1941] 1 D.L.R. 483). Appellant, by special leave from said Court of Appeal, appealed to this Court. Respondents moved to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction, on the ground that the judgment appealed from was not a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d within the meaning of ss. 2(b) and 36 of the Supreme Court Act (R.S.C., 1927, c. 35). The appeal and the motion to quash were heard together.\nHeld: This Court had jurisdiction to hear the appeal. The judgment of the Court of Appeal was an adjudication determining a substantive right of the parties in controversy in that Court, and was therefore a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d within the definition in s. 2 (b) of said Supreme Court Act.\nHeld also: The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Rinfret, Crocket and Taschereau JJ.: (1) Appellant, under the special Acts regulating its water works system (Ont.: 35 Vic., c. 80; 42 Vic., c. 78; 3-4 Geo. V, c. 109; 6 Geo. V, c. 85), has power to supply water to respondents; and each of respondents, under The Public Utilities Act (R.S.O., 1937, c. 286), ss. 2(1), 12, 25(1), has power to purchase water from appellant and to regulate its supply in its municipal area.\n(2) The Board has jurisdiction to fix the price of water supplied by appellant to each respondent from the time when an actual agreement in respect of rates ceased to exist; and for as long as the supply of water continues without the price or rate thereof being agreed upon by the parties themselves. Although, under its said special Acts, appellant has power to fix rates for water supplied to another municipality, yet the authority conferred upon the Board by said clause (ii) is not inconsistent with such powers of appellant; it may be read into the special Acts without repugnancy; and therefore the principle expressed in the maxim, generalia specialibus non derogant (discussed and cases thereon referred to), does not operate in the present case to exclude appellant from the Board\u2019s jurisdiction in the particular matter in question. (It was remarked that it was not contended that there was any power in the Board to compel appellant to supply or continue supplying water to respondents; that whether there is any governmental authority that can compel a municipality to supply water to another municipality was a question not before the Court). Per Davis J.: On the particular facts of the case, said clause (ii) applies, and the Board was right in deciding that it could proceed to hear respondents\u2019 applications. The Board was competent to make such decision, which was plainly something incidental to its administrative functions.\nPer Hudson J.: Appellant has power to supply respondents with water, and the Board has power to fix the rates; but the Board cannot compel appellant to sell or deliver water to respondents and, in so far as the Board is concerned at least, appellant has the right to refuse to deliver water if the rates imposed are not satisfactory to it.\nAPPEAL by the Corporation of the City of Ottawa from that part of the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] which held that the Ontario Municipal Board had authority and jurisdiction, under clause (ii) (enacted in 1940, c. 20, s. 1) of s. 59 of The Ontario Municipal Board Act (R.S.C., 1937, c. 60), to hear the applications of the present respondent municipalities for orders fixing the rates to be charged to said municipalities for water supplied to them by the said City corporation.\nThe material facts and circumstances of the case and the questions in dispute are sufficiently stated in the reasons for judgment in this Court now reported.\nLeave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was granted by the Court of Appeal for Ontario.\nThe respondents moved to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction, on the ground that the judgment appealed from was not a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d within the meaning of ss. 2 (b) and 36 of the Supreme Court Act (R.S.C., 1927, c. 35). The appeal and the motion to quash were heard together.\nF.B. Proctor K.C. and G.C. Medcalf for the appellant.\nH.E. Manning K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of Rinfret, Crocket and Taschereau JJ. was delivered by\nRINFRET J.\u2014The City of Ottawa has been supplying water to the respondent municipalities for some period of time.\nIn April, 1940, the respondents made application to the Ontario Municipal Board for a hearing pursuant to clause (ii) of section 59 of The Ontario Municipal Board Act (c. 60 of R.S.O., 1937), praying the Board to vary or fix the rates for water supplied by the City of Ottawa, and that the contracts or agreements between the City and residents of these municipalities be considered with the same hearing.\nThe Board appointed May 14th, 1940, for the hearing of all parties interested, whereupon the City applied to the Board for an order dismissing all proceedings, on the ground that the Ontario Municipal Board had no authority or jurisdiction to vary or fix the rates charged, or to be charged, in connection with water supplied to the respondent municipalities by the City, by reason of the provisions of the various special Acts of the Legislature relating to the waterworks of the Corporation of the City of Ottawa and the special powers vested in the Council of the City under such Acts.\nOn the other hand, the respondents made an application to the Board for an order for production, for examination on discovery of the Chief Engineer of the City of Ottawa, and for the right to inspect the waterworks system of the City.\nThe Board delivered judgment dismissing the City of Ottawa\u2019s motion and holding that the respondents had the right to apply to the Board under and by virtue of sec. 59 (ii) of The Ontario Municipal Board Act.\nThe appellant City of Ottawa took advantage of sec. 103 of The Ontario Municipal Board Act and, alleging again that the Board had no jurisdiction in the premises and that its decision with regard to the application of sec. 59 (ii) was erroneous in law, it applied to the Court of Appeal of Ontario to have the respondents\u2019 applications and the other proceedings before the Board set aside.\nLeave to appeal having been granted, the Court of Appeal affirmed the jurisdiction of the Board in the matter and dismissed the appeal of the City of Ottawa.\nFrom that judgment, the City was given leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nAs pointed out in the reasons for judgment of the Chief Justice of Ontario, who delivered the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal:\nWe are not concerned on this appeal with any question of the fairness of the rates charged, but only with the question of the Board\u2019s jurisdiction to vary or fix them. The judgment appealed from states that the respondent municipal corporations adjoin the City of Ottawa; and, none of them having any municipal waterworks of its own, the appellant has, for some considerable time, supplied water to them through its waterworks system. The method of supplying water has been similar in each case. Each of the respondents has laid its own water mains within its boundaries; and connection is made with a water main of the appellant\u2019s, at or near the boundary line. A meter, in each case, has been placed at this point; and each of the respondents pays according to fixed rates for the water measured by its meter. The appellant has nothing to do with the individual proprietor, or owner, or occupant supplied within the respondent municipality and deals only with the municipality.\nThe appellant raised the preliminary question that, in fact, it has no power vested in it to supply water to another municipality as such.\nThe appellant then set up the objection that all its rights and powers in respect of its waterworks are given to it by special Acts of the Legislature and that these rights and powers are not affected by the provisions of the general Act as amended in 1940 by the introduction of clause (ii) of sec. 59 of The Ontario Municipal Board Act.\nThe Court of Appeal held that it was not necessary to determine on this appeal the extent of the appellant\u2019s power to supply water to the respondent municipalities. It found that, in fact, it was supplying water and charging them for it; and it held that, so long as the appellant did, in fact, supply water to the respondents at a price, the jurisdiction of the Board, under sec. 59 (ii), to hear and determine an application by the respondents to vary or fix the rates charged by the appellant did not depend upon the establishment of some power in the appellant to supply the respondents with the water for which they pay. \u201cOne is entitled,\u201d said the learned Chief Justice, \u201cto assume against the appellant that what appellant is doing and is being paid for, is done by some lawful authority.\u201d\nDealing then with the appellant\u2019s contention that the general Statute of 1940, extending the powers of the Municipal Board to the varying or fixing of the rates for water supplied by one municipality to another, should not be deemed to apply to the appellant, because the latter is governed by and derives its powers from special Acts, the Court of Appeal proceeded to inquire from what source the appellant obtains its powers to fix the prices at which the water is supplied by it.\nAfter having examined successively the Act of 1872, authorizing the construction of the appellant\u2019s waterworks, and the several Acts modifying this initial statute, the Court of Appeal came to the conclusion that the appellant did not take from the special Acts its power to establish prices to be paid to it for water supplied to the respondents, but that it took it \u201cfrom some Act or under some principle of law of general application,\u201d and that there was no ground for excluding the appellant from the operation of the general provision contained in sec. 59 (ii) of The Ontario Municipal Board Act.\nThe judgment was, therefore, that the application to set aside the proceedings lodged before the Board should be dismissed and that the respondents shall be\nat liberty to proceed with their motion [to the Board] for directions and for an order for production and for the examination for discovery of the Chief Engineer of the [City of Ottawa], and for the right to inspect the waterworks system of the respondent [City of Ottawa] and generally as to the procedure to be followed in respect of the said applications.\nIn this Court, the preliminary question raised by the appellant must first be determined. In the Act of 1872[2], which was the Act whereby the City of Ottawa was authorized to construct waterworks, a body corporate was created under the name of \u201cWater Commissioners for the City of Ottawa.\u201d That body was given the powers necessary to build the works \u201cand to carry out all and every the powers conferred on them by this Act.\u201d\nThe Commissioners were entrusted with the matter of supplying water to the City, and, for that purpose, could build and construct the necessary works and appliances requisite for that object. With the assent and approval of the Corporation of the City, they were empowered to acquire lands and buildings as, in their opinion, may be necessary to enable them to fulfill their duties. The lands, buildings, privileges and waters acquired by the Commissioners were to be vested in the Corporation of the City; and they were said to be for distributing water to the inhabitants of the City of Ottawa, or for the uses of the Corporation of the said City, or of the proprietors or occupiers of the land through or near which [the lines of pipes] may pass.\nThen comes sec. 10 of the Act, whereunder\nthe Board of Commissioners for the time being shall regulate the distribution and use of the water in all places and for all purposes where the same may be required, and from time to time shall fix the prices for the use thereof * * *\nBy sec. 11, the Commissioners were given the power and authority, and it was stated to be \u201ctheir duty\u201d from time to time to fix the price, rate or rent, which any owner or occupant of any house, tenement, lot or part of lot or both, in, through, or past which the water pipes shall run, shall pay as water rate or rent, \u201cwhether such owner or occupant shall use the water or not.\u201d These powers were to include the right to assess vacant lots of land in the City of Ottawa fronting on the streets under which the water pipes were to be placed and to tax them, \u201cdue regard being had to the assessment and to the advantage which the said lot shall derive from water works.\u201d\nBy sec. 13, full power was given the Commissioners to make and enforce all necessary by\u2011laws and regulations for the collection of the water rent and the water rate. And, among the by-laws that it was declared to be lawful for the Commissioners so to make and enforce, they were authorized to prohibit, by fine or imprisonment, any person being occupant, tenant or inmate of any house supplied with water from the said waterworks from vending, selling or disposing of the water thereof (sec. 17).\nThen follow certain provisions here immaterial; and we come to secs. 25, 26 and 27, to which special attention must be given:\n25. The said commissioners shall have the full, entire and exclusive possession, control and management of the said lands and water works, and all things appertaining thereto; and shall and may in the name of the commissioners of waterworks for the City of Ottawa prosecute or defend any action or actions, suit or suits, or process at law or in equity, against any person or persons, for money due for the use of the water, for the breach of any contract, express or implied, touching the execution or management of the works, or the distribution of the water, or of any promise or contract made to or with them, and also for any injury, damage, trespass, spoil, nuisance or other wrongful act done, committed, or suffered to the said lands, works, water courses, sources of water supply, pipes, machinery, or any apparatus belonging to or connected with any part of the works, or for any improper use or waste of the water. 26. The water commissioners are hereby empowered to arrange with the corporation or with individuals for the extension of pipes in suburbs or partially built portions of the city, by allowing a deduction from the price charged for the water to such extent as the commissioners shall see fit on the cost of the said pipes when laid by the parties under the direction of the commissioners and subject to their approval; or the commissioners may lay the pipes, charging the said parties in addition to the usual water rate a yearly interest upon the cost of such extension, which interest, or such portion thereof as shall then be due, shall be paid at the same time and collected in the same manner as the water rates.\n27. The water commissioners shall have power and authority to supply any corporation, person or persons with water although not resident within the City of Ottawa, and may exercise all other powers necessary to the carrying out of their agreements with such persons as well within the townships of Nepean, Gloucester and the incorporated village of New Edinburgh as within the City of Ottawa; and they may also from time to time make and carry out any agreement which they may deem expedient for the supply of water to any railway company or manufactory; provided that no power or authority shall be exercised under this clause without the consent and approbation of the corporation of the City of Ottawa.\nThe other provisions of the Act need not be referred to for the purposes of this appeal.\nIn 1879, by the Statute of Ontario, 42 Vict., ch. 78, the powers of the water works commissioners were transferred to the Corporation of the City of Ottawa to be exercised through its Council. The Council, immediately after the passing of the Act, was to appoint a special committee of aldermen to discharge all the duties heretofore attended to by the Water Commissioners, subject to the approval and according to the directions of the Council.\nIn 1913, by the Statute of Ontario, 3-4 Geo. V, ch. 109, provision was made for the election of a Board of Water Commissioners. This Board was to have the management, maintenance and conduct of the waterworks of the City and of all buildings, material, machinery, land, water and appurtenances thereto belonging.\nBy subsec. 2 of sec. 1 of this Act, the provisions of The Public Utilities Act applicable to municipal waterworks, except in so far as the same may be inconsistent with the provisions of this Act or of any other special Act relating to the waterworks of the City, were to apply to and govern the Board so elected and the members thereof and the waterworks of the City.\nBy that statute, the City was authorized to take from certain lakes in the County of Ottawa, in the Province of Quebec, and to convey to the City, a supply of water for its waterworks, its municipal purposes and the use of the inhabitants of the City.\nSubsec. 2 of sec. 2 of that Act provided as follows:\nThe said Corporation may enter into agreements with any municipal corporation in Ontario or Quebec situate along the line of any supply pipe for supplying water to such corporation, and may supply water under the terms of any such agreement.\nBy the same statute, the City was given power to construct works and to acquire land and other powers for the purposes of its waterworks; and it was also given power to borrow $5,000,000 for this purpose.\nContemporaneously with the statute just mentioned, the City of Ottawa caused two other statutes to be passed respectively by the Legislature of Quebec (c. 81 of 4 Geo. V) and by the Dominion Parliament (c. 166 of 3-4 Geo. V). The former statute gave the City of Ottawa authority to obtain water supply from certain lakes in Quebec and to construct the necessary works therefor, including the right to take and acquire land, to enter into agreements with the City of Hull and with any other municipalities as to terms upon which a supply of water may be provided for such municipal corporations, such terms and conditions to be determined by The Quebec Utilities Commission, if the City of Hull and the City of Ottawa could not agree on them.\nThe Quebec statute contained further provisions regarding expropriation and municipal taxation, which are immaterial here.\nThe Dominion statute also gave power to the City of Ottawa to take water from certain lakes in the Province of Quebec, with the consent and subject to the approval of the Government of the Province of Quebec, to supply water to the City of Hull\nand to any other municipal corporation in the Province of Ontario or in the Province of Quebec, for the municipal purposes of any such municipal corporation, and the use of the inhabitants of such corporation.\nIt contained powers to construct works, to enter upon lands, to acquire (by expropriation or otherwise) lands or rights in Ontario and for compensation thereof, subject to the legislative control of the Legislature of Ontario; with the special provision that the construction, erection and main- tenance of the said works in, upon or over the Ottawa and Gatineau rivers shall be subject to the approval of the Minister of Public Works for Canada.\nIt was stated at bar that, for the purpose of exercising the powers conferred by the Ontario Act of 1913 (c. 109 of 3-4 Geo. V) authorizing the City to take a supply of water from certain lakes, the City passed its by-law No. 3649. This by-law was quashed by Lennox J.[3]\nA subsequent by-law (No. 3678) passed for the same purpose was again quashed[4].\nA joint appeal by the City of Ottawa from the quashing of its by-laws Nos. 3649 and 3678 was dismissed by the Court of Appeal[5].\nIn 1914, by An Act respecting the City of Ottawa (4 Geo. V, c. 82), provision was made for taking a vote of the municipal electors on two alternative water supply systems: that authorized by sec. 2 of the Act of 1913 (c. 109), commonly termed \u201cthe Thirty-One Mile Lake scheme\u201d; and what was termed \u201cthe Ottawa River Mechanical Filtration scheme.\u201d The vote gave a majority in favour of the latter; and, by a further Act of the same year (c. 84), provision was made for carrying this scheme into effect, subject to the approval of the Provincial Board of Health. If this Board refused to approve of the plans and specifications of the Ottawa River scheme, the Thirty-One Mile Lake scheme was to be proceeded with.\nThe Provincial Board of Health refused to approve the plans and specifications of the Ottawa River scheme; but an Order was made directing it to do so; and the Ottawa River Filtration scheme was subsequently carried into effect.\nIn 1916, by the Statute, 6 Geo. V, c. 85, the control, management and maintenance of the waterworks of the City and of all buildings, material, machinery, land, water and appurtenances thereto belonging, was vested in the Board of Control of the City, which was to discharge, subject to the approval and according to the directions of its Council, all the duties required by the Act of 1872, or by any Acts passed in amendment thereof, to be discharged by the Water Commissioners. Whatever doubts may be expressed as to the constitutionality of the Dominion statute of 1913 in respect of the powers therein granted to the City of Ottawa, it is unnecessary to deal with them in this appeal, for the appellant City need not rely on those powers, or the corresponding rights therein conferred, for the purposes of its argument. It was, no doubt, deemed necessary to secure from the Parliament of Canada the authority to construct, erect and maintain the projected works in, upon, or over, the Ottawa and Gatineau rivers, subject to the approval of the Minister of Public Works for Canada. And nothing more need be said about that statute for the present.\nBut the Ontario statute of 1913 contains two important provisions:\nFirst, it makes applicable to the Ottawa waterworks the provisions of The Public Utilities Act, except, of course, in so far as they may be inconsistent with the provisions of the special Acts relating to that City; and it enacts that, saving cases where it may be inconsistent with the special Acts, The Public Utilities Act shall apply to and govern the waterworks in question.\nSecond, it gives the City of Ottawa the power to\nenter into agreements with any municipal corporation in Ontario or Quebec situate along the line of any supply pipe for supplying water to such corporation [i.e., Ottawa], and may supply water under the terms of any such agreement.\nUndoubtedly the Legislature of Ontario was competent to confer such powers on the City of Ottawa, and it is not to the point to argue that these powers were granted in an Act primarily intended to authorize the City to take water from lakes in the County of Ottawa, in the Province of Quebec, and convey to that City a supply of water for its waterworks, its municipal purposes and the uses of the inhabitants of the City, and that the scheme having for object the taking of the necessary water from the lakes in question was not carried out.\nThe scheme may have been abandoned, at least for the time being, but the powers remain and may yet be taken advantage of.\nMoreover, the Statute itself is still in force; and it provides for several other matters, including the application of The Public Utilities Act and the authority to supply water to other municipalities in Ontario and Quebec. It is not to be doubted that all these powers are still in existence and vested in the City of Ottawa.\nIt being so, there can be no doubt that the appellant City has the required power to supply water to the respondent municipalities. It is unnecessary, therefore, to speculate as to the possible meaning of the words \u201cany corporation\u201d in sec. 27 of the Act of 1872. It is possible that those words are sufficient to include a municipal corporation, as decided by the Court of Appeal, to whose attention the particular subsection 2 of sec. 2 of the Act of 1913 apparently was not brought.\nAs for the respondents, they have power, under The Public Utilities Act (c. 286 of R.S.O., 1937), to purchase water from the appellant and to regulate its supply in their respective municipal area. Sections 2 (1), 12 and 25 (1) are sufficient to give them that power.\nWe may now, therefore, discuss the main question arising on the appeal: Whether the special Acts regulating the waterworks system of the City of Ottawa have the effect of excluding the application to the latter of subs. (ii) of sec. 59 of The Ontario Municipal Board Act.\nSection 59 deals with the general jurisdiction and powers of the Board in relation to municipal affairs.\nSubsection (ii), added in 1940, extended the jurisdiction of the Board so as to give it the power to\nhear and determine the application of any municipality to confirm, vary or fix the rates charged or to be charged in connection with water supplied thereto by any other municipality.\nThe subsection obviously presupposes the existence of an already valid and binding contract between the applicant municipality and the municipality which supplies water; otherwise the words \u201cconfirm\u201d and \u201cvary\u201d would be deprived of any meaning whatsoever. The Board is given the competency to confirm or vary rates already charged. This can happen only in cases where the supplying municipality has made a contract or an agreement with the applicant municipality. It must mean, therefore, that the Board is given authority to intervene in contracts or agreements and to modify the rates already agreed upon. The occasion for the Board\u2019s intervention may be a change of conditions or of circumstances; but the Board evidently is to be the judge of the necessity or, it may be, the opportunity of varying the rates, subject to the right of appeal from the Board to the Court of Appeal, upon a question of jurisdiction, or upon any question of law, as provided for by sec. 103 of the Board\u2019s Act. If the Board is not satisfied that circumstances warrant a variation in the rates, it need only confirm the latter.\nIt is not as easy to foresee under what conditions the Board may be called upon to \u201cfix the rates charged or to be charged,\u201d for the Board is not given the power to compel a municipality to supply water to another municipality. As a result, the mere fixing of rates would become quite meaningless and inoperative. Conceivably the Legislature had in contemplation the case where a municipality would be willing to supply water to another municipality willing to take it, and where the two municipalities would find it impossible to agree on the rates. They may then refer the matter to the Board, which, in that case, may exercise the power to fix those rates.\nAnd, of course, there may be a case, such as we have in this appeal, where the City of Ottawa has been supplying water for some time to the respondent municipalities without having previously fixed the rates therefor, and, assuming that the supplying and consuming municipalities would find it impossible to agree on the rate that should be charged for the supply, the Legislature has, by the legislation of 1940, designated the Ontario Municipal Board as the proper forum to go to for the purpose. Until that legislation was passed, presumably the supplying municipality would have had to apply to the ordinary courts for the fixation and recovery of the amount due to it on the basis of quantum meruit.\nIt would seem that such is the situation here, in so far as concerns the amount due to the appellant by the respondents for the water already supplied. If it be true, as we understood it to be, that for some time the water has been supplied to the Town of Eastview and to the Village of Rockcliffe Park without any agreement as to rates, and, as it would appear, the parties cannot come to an understanding as to the proper compensation to be paid for the water so supplied, the application of the respondents to have the rates fixed was properly made to the Ontario Municipal Board under sec. 59 (ii). The above conclusion, however, can hold true only if the appellant was unable to show, as found by the Court of Appeal, that, up to the Statute of 1940, it had the exclusive right to fix its own rates for water supply, and that the Statute of 1940, which is of general application, cannot prevail against the special Acts concerning the waterworks systems of the City of Ottawa.\nSuch is the contention of the City, based on the well known maxim: \u201cGeneralia specialibus non derogant.\u201d The scope of that maxim is well expressed in Halsbury, Laws of England, 2nd Ed., vol. 31, p. 549, par. 732:\n732. Statutory rights are not to be abrogated except by plain enactment, and, therefore, general statutes, whether enacted previously or subsequently, do not, if couched in general terms, operate to control special rights granted by private statutes which, while conferring such special rights, have also imposed special obligations. Rights given by a special statute are not taken away because they cause difficulties in the permissive working of general statutes not directed to the special point. A subsequent general statute may, however, indicate an express intention to control or to abrogate particular rights, especially where those rights are attached to a particular locality, and the subsequent statute brings to it entirely new benefits.\nA private statute can only exclude the application of a general statute to the extent to which the provisions of the general statute are excluded expressly or by necessary implication.\nThe rule laid down by Lord Westbury in the case of Ex parte The Vicar and Churchwardens of St. Sepulchre\u2019s, in re The Westminster Bridge Act, 1859[6] is this:\nIf the particular Act gives in itself a complete rule on the subject, the expression of that rule would undoubtedly amount to an exception of the subject-matter of the rule out of the [general] Act.\nAnd, in Seward v. The Owner of the \u201cVera Cruz\u201d[7], the Earl of Selborne, L.C., in the House of Lords, at p. 68, said:\nNow if anything be certain it is this, that where there are general words in a later Act capable of reasonable and sensible application without extending them to subjects specially dealt with by earlier legislation, you are not to hold that earlier and special legislation indirectly repealed, altered, or derogated from merely by force of such general words, without any indication of a particular intention to do so.\nReference might also be made to the judgment delivered by Sir Alfred Wills, on behalf of the Judicial Committee, in Esquimalt Waterworks Company v. Corporation of the City of Victoria[8].\nBut the manner in which the principle should be applied is illustrated in Toronto Railway Company v. Paget[9], where the present Chief Justice of this Court, at p. 491, says:\nOne possible view is that in such cases the provision in the general Act is to be wholly discarded from consideration; the other is that both provisions are to be read as applicable to the undertaking governed by the special Act so far as they can stand together, and only where there is repugnancy between the two provisions and then only to the extent of such repugnancy the general Act is to be inoperative.\nIn the same case, at p. 499, former Chief Justice Anglin of this Court said:\nIt is not enough to exclude the application of the general Act that it deals somewhat differently with the same subject-matter. It is not \u201cinconsistent,\u201d unless the two provisions cannot stand together.\nThe principle is, therefore, that where there are provisions in a special Act and in a general Act on the same subject which are inconsistent, if the special Act gives a complete rule on the subject, the expression of the rule acts as an exception of the subject-matter of the rule from the general Act (See: Ontario & Sault Ste. Marie Railway Company v. Canadian Pacific Railway Company[10]; Upper Canada College v. City of Toronto[11]).\nIn the words of Lord Halsbury, L.C., and of Lord Herschell, in Tabernacle Permanent Building Society v. Knight[12]:\nWhere is the inconsistency if both may stand together and both operate without either interfering with the other? * * * I think the test is, whether you can read the provisions of the later Act into the earlier without any conflict between the two.\nIf the rule, as expounded in the authorities just referred to, be applied in the present case, the Board of Commissioners was given the power to\nregulate the distribution and use of the water in all places and for all purposes where the same may be required, and from time to time shall fix the prices for the use thereof.\nWe may pass over sec. 25 of the Act of 1872, on the assumption that it deals only with the control and manage- ment of the physical properties appertaining to the waterworks system; but, under sec. 26, the Water Commissioners were\nempowered to arrange with the corporation or with individuals for the extension of pipes in suburbs * * * by allowing a deduction from the price charged for the water to such extent as the commissioners shall see fit * * * charging the said parties in addition to the usual water rate a yearly interest upon the cost of such extension, which interest, or such portion thereof as shall then be due, shall be paid at the same time and collected in the same manner as the water rates.\nAnd, under sec. 27,\nThe water commissioners shall have power and authority to supply any corporation, person or persons with water although not resident within the City of Ottawa, and may exercise all other powers necessary to the carrying out of their agreements with such persons as well within the townships of Nepean, Gloucester and the incorporated village of New Edinburgh as within the City of Ottawa.\nMoreover, we have already pointed out that, under the Act of 1913 (c. 109 of Statutes of Ontario, 3-4 Geo. V), the Corporation of the City of Ottawa\nmay enter into agreements with any municipal corporation in Ontario or Quebec situate along the line of any supply pipe for supplying water to such corporation, and may supply water under the terms of any such agreement.\nAnd the provisions of The Public Utilities Act applicable to municipal waterworks are made to apply to and govern the waterworks of the said City, except in so far as the same may be inconsistent with the provisions of the special Acts relating to the latter. If we refer to The Public Utilities Act then in force (c. 41 of 3-4 Geo. V), it is significant that the wording of sec. 9 of The Public Utilities Act is almost identical with the wording of sec. 10 of the special Act of 1872.\nReading the different sections we have referred to in the special Acts, and quite independently of the additional powers which may have been given to the appellant by the introduction of The Public Utilities Act, it would seem difficult not to conclude that the appellant has been given the authority to fix the prices and rates at which water is to be supplied by it. Indeed, its power to fix the prices and rates, if it were not otherwise expressed as it is, may be said to be incidental to its power to supply and to make agreements for that purpose. It is hardly conceivable that the City of Ottawa would have the authority to make agreements for the supply of water and that such authority would not carry with it the power to fix the price thereof.\nWhere, in sec. 10 of the Act of 1872, power is given to regulate the distribution and use of the water in all places and for all purposes where the same may be required, and from time to time to fix the prices for the use thereof; or in sec. 27, power and authority is given to supply any corporation, person, or persons, with water, although not resident within the City of Ottawa and it is said that the said Commissioners\nmay exercise all other powers necessary to the carrying put of their agreements with such persons as well within the townships of Nepean, Gloucester and the incorporated village of New Edinburgh as within the City of Ottawa,\nit would seem to follow that the power to make the agreement necessarily includes the power to fix the price, and that such power to fix the price is co-extensive with the power to supply the water.\nIn our opinion, therefore, the power to fix the prices and rates for the supply of water outside of Ottawa was granted to the latter by the special Acts concerning its waterworks system.\nBut it need not necessarily follow that the authority conferred upon the Ontario Municipal Board by sec. 59 (ii) is inconsistent with such powers as have been given to the City of Ottawa in its special Acts.\nThe authority of the Ontario Municipal Board under sec. 59 (ii) is for the purpose of supervising and controlling the rates charged or to be charged in connection with water supplied by one municipality to another municipality. As already noted, it presupposes that the prices or rates have already been fixed or agreed upon between the two municipalities; and, for some reasons of public concern present in the mind of the Legislature of Ontario, it enacts that the Board may confirm or vary these prices or rates charged or to be charged.\nThe two powers are not inconsistent. Those given in the general Act may well be read into the special Act without repugnancy. The City of Ottawa, in making its agreement with the other municipalities, will fix the rates; but, for some special reasons such as the happening of fresh circumstances or conditions, the Board may be asked to intervene and to vary those prices and rates and it will be within the competency of the Board to order the variation to be made. The two provisions can stand together within the principle laid down in this Court, and already referred to, in Toronto Railway Company v. Paget[13]; and, as a consequence, the maxim, generalia specialibus non derogant, does not operate in the present case to exclude the City of Ottawa from the jurisdiction of the Ontario Municipal Board in this particular matter.\nThat jurisdiction is to \u201chear and determine the application of any municipality to confirm, vary or fix the rates charged or to be charged,\u201d etc. The words \u201cconfirm, vary\u201d imply that the rates are already in existence, either by having been agreed upon between the two municipalities or through having been fixed by the supplying municipality and accepted by the municipality taking the water. In that case, presumably the reason for the application to the Board for varying the rates might be the happening of fresh facts, changed conditions, or new circumstances of a nature to justify a modified price or consideration for the water supplied.\nBut the language of the legislation necessarily supposes already existing rates in respect of which the applicant municipality moves the Board to order a modification.\nOf course, in the present case, the Court of Appeal, dealing with the applications of the Townships of Gloucester and Nepean (which had joined the present respondents in applying to vary or fix the rates for water supplied by the City of Ottawa), found that, at the time when the amendment of 1940 was enacted, the two townships had a contract still current by which the prices for water to be supplied were fixed for the term of the contract. It was deemed that the new legislation was not intended \u201cto affect rights existing at the time of its enactment\u201d; and, for that reason, the Court of Appeal decided that the appeal should be allowed as to the Townships of Gloucester and Nepean.\nIf, however, the new legislation does not affect contracts or agreements already in existence at the time it came into force, there can be no question that the intention of the Legislature was to vest in the Board the necessary competency to modify, in respect of rates, contracts or agreements entered into at a date subsequent to the coming into force of the legislation.\nIt is also apparent that the Board has been given the power to fix rates for water already supplied, in cases where there has been no agreement as to rates. We apprehend that the right to \u201cdetermine the application of any municipality to * * * fix the rates charged\u201d can have no other meaning, or, at all events, is sufficiently wide to include such a power.\nThe Board accordingly has jurisdiction to fix the price of water supplied by the City of Ottawa to the Town of Eastview and the Village of Rockcliffe Park from the time when an actual agreement in respect of rates ceased to exist between the City and the two other municipalities respectively and for as long as the supply of water continues without the price or rate thereof being agreed upon by the parties themselves.\nIt was not contended that there was any power in the Municipal Board to compel the City of Ottawa to supply or to continue the supply of water to the respondents or either of them. And whether there is any governmental authority that can compel one municipality to supply water to another municipality is a question that is not before us.\nThe applications made to the Board by the respondents are merely \u201cto vary or fix the rates for water supplied by the City of Ottawa.\u201d We find nothing, either in the order issued by the Board on September 27th, 1940, or in the judgment of the Court of Appeal, to indicate that the order of the Board has reference to anything more.\nThe respondents raised a preliminary point that this Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. The appeal was launched after special leave thereto was granted by the Court of Appeal; but the respondents contend that the judgment of the Board was not final within the definition of \u201cfinal judgment\u201d in the Supreme Court Act.\nThe point in controversy in the Court of Appeal, and upon which that Court made an adjudication, was in respect to the jurisdiction of the Ontario Municipal Board and the right of the respondents to bring the appellant before that Board for the object of fixing or varying the rates for the supply of water by the appellant to the respondents. In our view, the judgment of the Court of Appeal determined a substantive right of the parties which was in controversy in that proceeding, and accordingly a matter well within the definition of \u201cfinal judgment\u201d in sec. 2 (b) of the Supreme Court Act. (Quebec Railway, Light & Power Company v. Montcalm Land Company and the City of Quebec[14]).\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDAVIS J.\u2014This is an appeal by the City of Ottawa from the order of the Court of Appeal for Ontario which affirmed the jurisdiction of the Ontario Municipal Board.\nThe City of Ottawa has for many years supplied water to two adjoining municipalities, the Town of Eastview and the Village of Rockcliffe Park, by delivering the same, not to the individual consumers in those municipalities, but to the adjoining municipalities themselves, who take the water at or near the City\u2019s boundary line, carry it through their own waterworks systems, make delivery to their own consumers and apparently charge their consumers with whatever rates they see fit.\nNot only has the City of Ottawa been supplying water to these adjoining municipalities for many years, but it is continuing to do so and makes no threat of cessation of the supply of water by it to these adjoining municipalities. Prior to an amendment to The Ontario Municipal Board Act made in 1940, to which I shall presently refer, the then existing written agreements between the City of Ottawa and these two adjoining municipalities respectively had expired by effluxion of time and the parties have since been unable to agree upon the price or rate to be paid by the adjoining municipalities to the City of Ottawa for the continued supply of water. Some tentative arrangement appears to have been made between the parties until the matter is settled, though the terms of any such arrangement are not disclosed.\nBy ch. 20 of the Statutes of Ontario, 1940, sec. 59 of The Ontario Municipal Board Act, R.S.O. (1937), ch. 60, which defines the general municipal jurisdiction of the Board, was amended by adding thereto the following clause: 59. (ii) hear and determine the application of any municipality to confirm, vary or fix the rates charged or to be charged in connection with water supplied thereto by any other municipality.\nThe adjoining municipalities made application to the Municipal Board, pursuant to this amendment, to have the rates to be charged them by the City of Ottawa fixed by the Board. But the City protested upon several grounds that the Board had no jurisdiction in the matter. The City contended that strictly it has not and never had any power to sell and deliver water to other municipal corporations; that if there is any such power, there is no obligation to do so; that the City, if it has authority to make an agreement for the supply of water, will impose whatever rates it thinks fair and that the Ontario Municipal Board has no right to interfere and fix the rates to be charged.\nThe Board heard argument on this preliminary objection of the City but decided that it had jurisdiction to proceed with the applications. The Court of Appeal, pursuant to sec. 103 of The Ontario Municipal Board Act, gave leave to the City to appeal to that Court. That Court affirmed the jurisdiction of the Municipal Board to deal with the applications of the two adjoining municipalities. The City of Ottawa now further appeals to this Court from that judgment.\nThe respondents, the adjoining municipalities, raised a preliminary point that this Court is without jurisdiction, contending that the order of the Court of Appeal is not a final judgment. But if the appellant, the City of Ottawa, succeeds in its appeal, that is, succeeds in its contention that the Ontario Municipal Board has no jurisdiction to entertain the applications of the adjoining municipalities to fix the rates to be charged, then that is the end of the matter, and I think the order appealed from comes within the definition of \u201cfinal judgment\u201d in the Supreme Court Act.\nThe validity of The Ontario Municipal Board Act was considered recently by the Privy Council in the case of Toronto v. York[15]. In the judgment of the Privy Council the Board as constituted by the statute is primarily an administrative body and as such its constitution and operations are within the legislative competence of the Ontario legislature. The Privy Council did point out several sections in the Act which it thought involved judicial functions and as such beyond the legislative competence of the Ontario legislature, but considered those sections severable.\nThe real point in the appeal is whether or not the Municipal Board had the right to entertain an application to determine its own jurisdiction in the matter. The Board heard argument and decided it had power to proceed. On the particular facts of the case I think the Board was competent to say, as it did, that it could proceed with the applications of the adjoining municipalities to fix the rates to be charged. It was not in dispute that the City of Ottawa has been supplying water to these adjoining municipalities for many years and continues to do so. It is not suggested by the City that it desires or intends to cut off the supply of water to these adjoining municipalities. But the parties cannot agree upon the rate or price. On those facts I think it plain that the case is covered by the 1940 amendment to The Ontario Municipal Board Act and that the Board was right in saying that it could proceed to hear the applications to fix the rates to be charged. Such a decision is plainly something incidental to the administrative functions of the Board.\nI should dismiss the appeal with costs.\nHUDSON J.\u2014It is unnecessary for me to restate the facts and the relevant sections of the Statute. My conclusion is that the City of Ottawa has power to supply the adjacent municipalities with water, but that the Ontario Municipal Board has not the power to compel Ottawa to sell or deliver water to these municipalities. I think that the true construction of the enactments is that the Ontario Municipal Board has power to fix the rates charged or to be charged by Ottawa to these municipalities, but that the City of Ottawa has the right, in so far as the Board is concerned at least, to refuse to deliver water if the rates thus imposed are not satisfactory.\nIt was contended on behalf of Eastview and Rockcliffe that the Provincial Minister of Health has the right to compel delivery of water but no such order has been made, and it is not necessary to the disposition of the present matter that this question should be considered. My view, therefore, is that the opinion of the Court of Appeal is substantially correct and that the appeal should be dismissed, with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Frank B.

The two doctors made their reports, finding appellant to be mentally ill; whereupon the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. Appellant appealed to this Court.\nHeld: Under s. 8 (2) of said Act, the Court of Appeal had the power to proceed as it did; and the present appeal from its order should, upon consideration of said doctors\u2019 reports, be dismissed.\nA point raised in the Court of Appeal and in this Court (and which, it was held, could, in a proceeding of this nature, be so raised, though not raised before the Judge of first instance) was that appellant was improperly detained because he was not a properly certificated patient under s. 20 of The Mental Hospitals Act, R.S.O., 1937, c. 392, in that the certificates upon which he was originally admitted to the hospital did not \u201cshow clearly\u201d that the medical practitioner \u201cafter due inquiry into all the necessary facts relating to the case of the patient, found him to be mentally ill.\u201d No opinion was expressed in the Court of Appeal or in this Court as to the sufficiency of the certificates in question; but this Court pointed out that \u201cit might be difficult successfully to contend that a certificate did \u2018show clearly, that due inquiry was made into all the necessary facts relating to the case of the patient, if a medical practitioner signing a certificate considered that the patient had delusions without any investigation on the doctor\u2019s part as to whether they were in fact delusions.\u201d\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissing the appellant\u2019s appeal from the order of Hogg J.[1] dismissing his application (made following the issue of a writ of habeas corpus) for an order discharging him from custody in the Ontario Hospital at Brockville, where he was detained as being mentally ill.\nS. Berger K.C. and H. Solway for the appellant.\nC. P. Hope K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nKERWIN J.\u2014This is an appeal by Robert Kenneth Carnochan from an order of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirming the dismissal by Hogg J. of the application of the appellant for an order discharging him from custody in the Ontario Hospital at Brockville. The only ground stressed before us was that the appellant never was, and is not now, a proper certificated patient under section 20 of The Mental Hospitals Act, R.S.O., 1937, chapter 392, and that he is, therefore, improperly detained and should be discharged.\nThe certificates upon which the appellant was admitted to the institution were made upon the prescribed forms but it is said that they were not sufficient because each does not, to quote subsection 2 of section 20,\nstate and show clearly that the medical practitioner * * * after due inquiry into all the necessary facts relating to the case of the patient, found him to be mentally ill.\nEmphasis was placed upon the words \u201cshow clearly.\u201d In each certificate appears paragraphs 1 and 2. These, together with the answers made by one doctor, are as follows:\u2014\n1. Facts indicating mental illness observed by myself:\nAppearance.\nNegative.\nConduct.\nQuiet and rational. Seems to have fixed delusions as to the infidelity of his wife and says his mother, brother and sister side with her. Also will not definitely state\nConversation.\nthat his wife may have put poison in his food but that he has some grounds for thinking so.\n2. Other facts, if any, indicating mental illness communicated to me by others:\n(State from whom the information received.)\n[Not answered.]\nIn the other certificate, these paragraphs and the answers read:\u2014\n1. Facts indicating mental illness observed by myself:\nAppearance.\nNervous, suspicious.\nConduct.\nTalkative, agitated.\nConversation.\nPertaining to supposed infidelity of wife and fact which to the patient\u2019s mind confirms his theory of her infidelity and illegitimacy of their child.\n2. Other facts, if any, indicating mental illness communicated to me by others:\u2014\n(State from whom the information received.)\nBrief outline of history for past 2 years obtained from Dr. McKerracher re patient\u2019s belief that his wife has committed adultery with patient\u2019s brother, that child is illegitimate, that he is actually impotent, that wife has fed him saltpetre, etc., causing monthly rectal pains.\nThis point was not dealt with by Mr. Justice Hogg because at that time counsel for appellant admitted \u201cthat all the terms and provisions of section 20 of the said statute were complied with.\u201d The question was raised, however, before the Court of Appeal, and in a proceeding of this nature there is nothing to prevent this being done. We do not understand that the Court of Appeal took any different view. The formal order of that Court states:\u2014 \u201cthis Court expressing no opinion or conclusion thereon.\u201d After reserving judgment, the Court of Appeal directed that the appellant be examined separately by two doctors appointed by the Court, not connected with any Ontario Hospital for persons mentally ill, and then adjourned the appeal sine die. The two doctors made their reports, finding the appellant mentally ill, whereupon the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal.\nA writ of habeas corpus had been issued, following which the motion was made before the judge of first instance, and the appeal from the latter\u2019s order to the Court of Appeal was taken pursuant to section 8 of The Habeas Corpus Act, R.S.O., 1937, chapter 129. Under subsection 2 of this section, that Court had the power to proceed as it did, and consideration of the reports from the two doctors appointed by the Court of Appeal satisfies us that the proper order has been made in the circumstances. We express no opinion as to the sufficiency of the certificates under which the appellant was originally committed to the Ontario Hospital at Brockville, but deem it proper to point out that it might be difficult successfully to contend that a certificate did \u201cshow clearly\u201d that due inquiry was made into all the necessary facts relating to the case of the patient, if a medical practitioner signing a certificate considered that the patient had delusions without any investigation on the doctor\u2019s part as to whether they were in fact delusions.\nThe appeal should be dismissed without costs.\nAppeal dismissed without costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Berger & Greenberg.\nSolicitor for the respondents: C.P.

The jury, to the question: \u201cHave the defendants satisfied you that the damages sustained by the plaintiff were not caused or contributed to by the negligence of [the driver of the car]?\u201d answered \u201cNo\u201d; and to the question: \u201cWas the plaintiff guilty of any negligence which caused or contributed to the accident?\u201d answered \u201cNo\u201d; and assessed plaintiff\u2019s damages at $25,000, for which amount judgment was given. An appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario was dismissed, and defendants appealed to this Court.\nThis Court ordered a new trial. The Chief Justice (dissenting in part) would dismiss the appeal except as to damages, as regards which he would direct a new trial.\nPer Rinfret and Crocket JJ.: Defendants\u2019 defence was not fairly put to the jury by the trial judge, particularly, in view of the circumstances and plaintiff\u2019s actions, with regard to the question as to plaintiff\u2019s negligence and with regard to the doctrine of contributory negligence. On these matters and also as to the degree of onus of proof on defendants under The Highway Traffic Act (R.S.O., 1937, c. 288, s. 48), there were statements or inadequate explanations amounting to misdirection in the trial judge\u2019s charge. The form of the first above quoted question to the jury, as the questions were put in this case, was calculated to mislead a jury. The fact that the Legislature has placed the onus of negativing negligence upon the defendant does not require the use of such a form of question. The amount of damages awarded was unreasonable, and unjustifiable in any conceivable view of the evidence.\nPer Davis and Hudson JJ.: Some features of the trial were so highly unsatisfactory that there should be a new trial.\nPer Taschereau J.: The verdict of the jury on the questions of contributory negligence and assessment of damages was not supported by the evidence, and no jury properly instructed and acting judicially could reasonably have reached it.\nAPPEAL by the defendants from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissing their appeal from the judgment of McFarland J., upon the findings of the jury, at trial. The action was for damages for injury suffered by the plaintiff caused by his being struck by a motor car driven by the defendant Gardner, who was an employee of the defendant Landreville, and was, in the course of his employment, driving a taxi-cab owned by the defendant Landreville.\nThe plaintiff had called to the driver of a bakery sleigh which was proceeding westerly on the north part of Rideau street in the city of Ottawa, and the plaintiff crossed the street to purchase some pies and was in the act of purchasing them at the sleigh when the accident happened, being at about 4.50 p.m. on February 16, 1939. The taxi-cab was being driven westerly. The driver of it testified that he had got off the street car tracks to let a street car behind him pass, that he was driving at about 10 to 12 miles an hour, that the surface of the street was icy, that the sun was shining very brightly right in his eyes, and he did not see the bread sleigh until he was near to it, that he put on his brakes and the car skidded.\nThe plaintiff was badly injured, suffering a severe crushing of the right leg. At the trial, the jury, to the question: \u201cHave the defendants satisfied you that the damages sustained by: the plaintiff were not caused or contributed to by the negligence of the defendant Gardner?\u201d answered \u201cNo\u201d; and to the question: \u201cWas the plaintiff guilty of any negligence which caused or contributed to the accident?\u201d answered \u201cNo.\u201d The jury assessed the damages sustained by the plaintiff at $25,000, for which amount judgment was given for the plaintiff.\nThe defendants appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario and their appeal was dismissed. The defendants appealed to this Court.\nAuguste Lemieux K.C. for the appellants.\nWalter F. Schroeder K.C. and Lionel Choquette for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting in part)\u2014With great respect for my colleagues, who take a different view, I should dismiss this appeal except as to damages, as regards which I should direct a new trial.\nThe judgment of Rinfret and Crocket JJ. was delivered by\nCROCKET J.\u2014I think the record discloses that the appellants\u2019 defence was not fairly put to the jury. The gist of that defence was that the plaintiff\u2019s injury was solely caused by his own negligence, and that he was the author of his own regrettable misfortune. That was the vital issue as raised by the pleadings. It clearly necessitated for its intelligent consideration by a jury, not only a statement of the recognized definition of negligence generally, but a clear, precise and understandable exposition of the much more difficult doctrine of contributory negligence in its application to the facts and circumstances of the case. Yet the presiding judge, after telling the jury that they must accept his directions upon questions of law, and that the crucial question in the case was whether Gardner\u2019s act in driving blind on a street heavy with traffic for at least 100 feet was the act of a prudent man, distinctly told them that that was not the act of a prudent man. And this without directing their attention to any of the undisputed facts and circumstances, upon which the defence relied as an excuse for his doing so. He had already plainly told the jury that all three of the persons involved in the collision (Gardner, the driver of the horse drawn bakery delivery sleigh and the plaintiff) had a right to be where they were (presumably immediately before the collision). And this, notwithstanding the fact, as he later pointed out, that he personally would accept the evidence of the driver of the delivery sleigh, and of the plaintiff himself, as against the testimony of a passing witness, whose evidence was to the contrary, and that the situation was this, as he saw it:\nthe sleigh is there, there is a car parked between it and the curb, so we may take it that the left side of the sleigh (that is the south side) was probably 12 to 14 feet south of the north curb of the street.\nThis close to five o\u2019clock in the afternoon on one of the principal and most congested streets in Ottawa with a double line of electric car tracks and trams constantly running along each line. In my opinion, these statements constituted positive misdirection.\nMoreover, two questions, upon which the appellant\u2019s liability depended, were left to the jury. They were:\u2014\n1. Have the defendants satisfied you that the damages sustained by the plaintiff were not caused or contributed to by the negligence of the defendant Gardner?\n2. Was the plaintiff guilty of any negligence which caused or contributed to the accident?\nIf your answer to that question is \u201cYes,\u201d then state fully the particulars of such negligence.\nAll His Lordship said in leaving these two decisive questions to the jury was:\u2014\nYou, gentlemen, know that in actions of this kind, for damages, and so on, the onus is upon the plaintiff, the man who brings the action; he is under the necessity of satisfying the jury, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant was negligent. But some years ago, on account of the tremendous increase in accidents involving pedestrians and motor-cars, and the tremendous slaughter on the highways, the legislature in its wisdom saw fit to change that, and consequently they enacted a new section, which is in the Highway Traffic Act, which governs these affairs. The effect of that section is that there are issues involved which arise out of the contact of a motor-car with a pedestrian on a highway, the onus is shifted, and the necessity is upon the driver of the car to prove that he was not guilty of negligence; that the vehicle was not operated in a manner which constituted negligence on his part.\nHaving instructed the jury that had it not been for the action of the legislature, \u201con account of the tremendous increase in accidents involving pedestrians and motor-cars, and the tremendous slaughter on the highways,\u201d in shifting the onus which formerly lay upon the plaintiff in an action against the owner or driver of a motor-car of satisfying the jury \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d the jury could not very well be expected to draw any other inference from this language than that the owner or driver of a car, upon whom the onus is now placed, must satisfy the jury that he was not guilty of negligence by the same degree of proof, viz., proof \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt.\u201d No such result, of course, follows the shifting of the onus from the plaintiff to the defendant in any civil action for damages.\nThis to my mind was further misdirection.\nHaving regard to the undisputed fact that it was the plaintiff himself who, from the sidewalk on the opposite side of the street, signalled the bakery delivery to stop in order that he might buy some pies on the street, and that he detained the covered sleigh in the position described by him beside a parked automobile while he inspected the pies the driver was showing him after opening the rear doors of the delivery sleigh, and to the continuous movement of automobiles and electric cars along that side of the street, I cannot think that the presiding judge was warranted in practically withdrawing from the jury, as he did, the question of negligence on the part of the plaintiff himself. The icy condition of the street pavement, and the fact that all automobiles moving westward would have to swerve from the northerly railway track when signalled by approaching electric cars and make room for them to pass, must surely have been as patent to him as to anybody else. By his own evidence he not only made the first move in the creation of the obstruction of the highway, but he caused its continuance for his own private convenience regardless of the inconvenience and danger it might cause to others.\nThe suggestion that the plaintiff could not in law be held either to have caused or to have materially contributed to cause the accident by so unnecessarily stopping a horse drawn baker\u2019s delivery at such a time and place and in such circumstances and detaining it while he leisurely proceeded to make his desired purchase in the middle of the street without regard either to his own safety or the danger he was thereby creating for others, cannot to my mind be entertained.\nThen there is the further objection as to excessive damages. As to this the learned trial judge gave much fuller instructions, going into detail as to the plaintiff\u2019s occupation as a paper\u2011hanger, painter and decorator, and his average earnings for a period before the accident (stated by him as being $100 a month); the loss of the rental value of an apartment; the expenses of medical, surgical and hospital treatment he had undergone, and the estimated cost of future treatment in the event of amputation of his leg becoming necessary, which one of the doctors placed at $1,000, including the cost of an artificial leg, and $1,500 in case it should not have to be amputated. Dealing with the question of the prospective loss of earnings as a painter, His Lordship directed the jury that they must consider the possibility of his securing some other employment. In this connection he pointed out that he was a man of only 33, who had impressed him as of fairly good education, keen and industrious, and suggested the probability of a man of his age and capability getting employment at some task in some other business, which might afford him a greater remuneration than his former business did. The jury, however, made a lump assessment of damages\u2014no less than $25,000. This amount, I have no hesitation in saying I regard as altogether unreasonable and one which it is impossible to justify in any conceivable view of the evidence.\nCounsel for the respondent submitted a statement in his factum to meet the objection regarding the abnormal amount of the assessment. This statement tries to show that approximately $10,000 of this amount was for special damages as estimated, including loss of earnings for two years more ($3,456, at $144 a month) and the $1,500 estimated for possible future hospital, medical and surgical expenses. Apparently counsel had then concluded that the leg would not have to be amputated, so the $1,500 is set down instead of the $1,000, had amputation been found necessary. Anyway it is submitted that the jury really awarded only $15,000 for general damages. The statement only shows, I think, the extreme difficulty the respondent\u2019s counsel have had in their endeavours to find any justification for such an unprecedented award of damages for a comminuted fracture of a leg, or, as the plaintiff\u2019s attending surgeon described it, \u201can explosive fracture\u201d of the leg\u2014\u201cThe kind of fracture,\u201d the plaintiff\u2019s counsel immediately interjected, \u201cthat you would expect from a shell, that sort of blows the bone to pieces?\u201d to which the attending surgeon at once replied \u201cYes, explodes it.\u201d It is, perhaps, not to be wondered at in view, not only of the harrowing nature of the injury, but of the apparently excruciating nature of the treatment the plaintiff was compelled to undergo, as depicted in this and other equally leading questions,\u2014none of which seem to have been objected to,\u2014that the jury should have felt it to be their duty, not only to indemnify the plaintiff, but to punish the defendant and his employer by saddling upon them such an amount of damages as it would be difficult to justify, even upon the basis of exemplary or punitive damages.\nI do not say that there was no evidence, upon which a jury might perhaps find that there was some negligence on the part of the driver of the automobile, which contributed in the legal sense to the accident. For this reason the action could not now well be dismissed. I cannot understand, however, how the jury, had they been properly instructed upon the question of contributory negligence and had the question concerning the defendants\u2019 negligence been put to them in the same form as that which concerned the plaintiff\u2019s negligence, could reasonably find, in the face of the plaintiff\u2019s own testimony, that the plaintiff himself was not guilty of any negligence, which contributed to the accident. I understand that there have been some cases, in which a similar form of question has been used, but it seems to me that the form of question 1 is calculated to mislead a jury, especially when it is not accompanied by any direction, in the event of their answering \u201cYes,\u201d to state fully the particulars of such negligence, as the jury here were directed to do in question 2, and to place any defendant in such a case at a distinct disadvantage as implying that the court expected the answer to that question to be \u201cNo.\u201d The fact that the Legislature has placed the onus of negativing negli- gence upon the defendant does not require the use of such a form of question. Surely any trial judge could leave the question of the defendants\u2019 negligence in the same terms as those in which he leaves the question of the plaintiff\u2019s negligence, and instruct the jury as to the burden of proof, which the Highway Traffic Act has cast upon the driver or owner of a motor vehicle.\nFor all these reasons, my conclusion is that this appeal should be allowed, and the judgment of the Court of Appeal affirming the trial judgment set aside with costs here and in the Court of Appeal, and that the whole case should be sent back for a new trial. The costs of the abortive trial should be in the discretion of the judge at the new trial.\nThe judgment of Davis and Hudson JJ. was delivered by\nDAVIS J.\u2014I regard some features of the trial of this action as so highly unsatisfactory that I should direct a new trial.\nI should therefore allow the appeal, set aside the judgment at the trial and the order of the Court of Appeal affirming that judgment, and direct a new trial. The appellants are entitled to their costs in the Court of Appeal and in this Court. The costs of the abortive trial should be in the discretion of the judge at the new trial.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I believe that this appeal should be allowed and a new trial ordered.\nThe verdict of the jury on the questions of contributory negligence and assessment of damages is not supported by the evidence, and I am satisfied that no jury properly instructed and acting judicially could reasonably have reached it.\nThe appellants should be entitled to their costs in the Court of Appeal and in this Court. The costs of the abortive trial should be in the discretion of the judge at the new trial.\nAppeal allowed with costs; new trial ordered.\nSolicitor for the appellants: Auguste Lemieux.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Lionel Choquette.\n",

The King, [1941] S.C.R. 481\nDate: 1941-06-24\nWilliam Koufis Appellant;\nand\nHis Majesty The King Respondent.\n1941: April 30; 1941: May 1; 1941: June 24.\nPresent: Duff C.J. and Rinfret, Crocket, Kerwin and Taschereau JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA EN BANC\nCriminal law\u2014Evidence\u2014Accused charged with arson\u2014Contention that accused arranged that other persons carry out the crime\u2014Evidence of conversations between such other persons\u2014Admissibility\u2014Questioning of accused, in cross-examination, as to alleged fire at other premises than those in question.\nThe accused appealed from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc, 15 M.P.R. 459, affirming his conviction of having unlawfully and wilfully set fire to a store. The appeal was based on certain objections of law, which were grounds of dissent in the said Court en banc.\n(1) One G. testified that accused hired him to commit the crime and G. arranged with P. to do it. P. testified that he secured the assistance of T. P. and T. gave evidence that they set the premises on fire. It was objected that evidence of P. and T., particularly with reference to their conversations with each other and with G., was improperly admitted.\nHeld, that this ground of appeal failed.\nPer the Chief Justice and Kerwin J.: The evidence of P. and T. did not implicate accused in any way, but was admissible to prove the actual setting of the fire. Accused was not charged with having conspired to commit arson and, as the trial judge explained to the jury, the actions of P. and T. and the conversations between them were relevant to the charge upon which accused was being tried only if the jury were satisfied as to the truth of the evidence given by G. relating to his conversation with accused.\nPer Rinfret, Crocket and Taschereau JJ.: Any acts done or words spoken in furtherance of the common design may be given in evidence against all (Paradis v. The King, [1934] S.C.R. 165). This rule applies to all indictments for crime, and not only when the indictment is for conspiracy, and it also applies even if the conspirator whose words or acts are tendered as evidence has not been indicted (Cloutier v. The King, [1940] S.C.R. 131, at 137). These principles were properly applied to the present case.\n(2) It was objected that the prosecuting officer, in cross-examining accused, had improperly questioned him as to an alleged fire at other premises than those in question, which questioning had greatly prejudiced accused with the jury.\nHeld: Effect should be given to this objection; the appeal should be allowed and a new trial ordered.\nPer the Chief Justice and Kerwin J.: The likely, if not the only, effect upon the jurymen of said questioning would be that accused was a Person who was very apt to commit the crime with which he was charged. A person charged with having committed a crime is not only entitled to have placed before the jury only evidence that is relevant to the issues before the court, but, when testifying on his own behalf, he may not be asked questions that have no possible bearing upon such issues and might only tend to prejudice a fair trial. The questioning complained of could not be justified on the ground that it went to accused's credibility: credibility cannot arise in connection with questions relating to an extraneous matter that has not been opened by the examination in chief of accused or otherwise on his behalf.\nPen Rinfret, Crocket and Taschereau JJ.: An accused has, to answer the specific charge mentioned in the indictment for which he is standing on trial, and the evidence must be limited to matters relating to the transaction which forms the subject of the indictment (Maxwell v. Director of Public Prosecutions, [1935] A.C. 309); otherwise the real issue may be distracted from the jury's minds, and an atmosphere of guilt created, prejudicial to the accused. The accused cannot be cross-examined on other criminal acts supposed to have been committed by him, unless he has been convicted, or unless these acts are connected with the offence charged and tend to prove it (Paradis v. The King, [1934] S.C.R. 165, at 169), or unless they show a system or a particular intention, as decided in Brunei v. The King, 57 Can. S.C.R. 83. The questioning of accused complained of may have influenced the verdict of the jury and caused accused a substantial wrong.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc[1] affirming (Hall and Archibald JJ. dissenting) the conviction of the appellant, at trial before Doull J. and a jury, of having \"unlawfully, without legal justification or excuse, and without colour of right, wilfully set fire\" to a certain store \"and did thereby commit arson.\"\nThe questions before this Court on this appeal, and the nature of the evidence or proceedings from which such questions arose, are sufficiently set out in the reasons for judgment in this Court now reported.\nThe appeal to this Court was allowed and a new trial ordered.\nJ. W. Maddin K.C. and I. G. MacLeod for the appellant.\nHon. J. H. MacQuarrie K.C. and M. A. Patterson for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Kerwin J. was delivered by Kerwin J.\u2014The appellant Koufis was convicted on an indictment charging him with having unlawfully set fire to a store known as Diana Sweets, in Sydney, Nova Scotia, on or about April 18th, 1940. On an appeal to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc, the conviction was affirmed. Mr. Justice Hall and Mr. Justice Archibald dissented and would have ordered a new trial on the ground that the prosecuting officer, in cross-examining the accused, had improperly questioned him as to an alleged fire at premises known as the London Grill, in Sydney, which greatly prejudiced the accused with the jury. Mr. Justice Hall also dissented on the ground that the evidence of two witnesses called by the Crown (Pentecost and Thistle), particularly with reference to their conversations with each other and with one Jerome Gerrior, was improperly admitted in evidence.\nKoufis appealed to this Court against the affirmance of this conviction on these two questions of law. As to the second point, we announced at the hearing that we would not require to hear counsel for the respondent, as we considered the evidence of the two men admissible. As to the first, we have had the advantage of a complete argument and we have determined that the questions referred to were improperly asked.\nAt one time Koufis was a partner in the restaurant and confectionery business known as Diana Sweets and also in a similar business operated under the name of the London Grill. He sold his interest in both and left Sydney. Upon his return to that city, he desired to become a partner in the Diana Sweets business again but that was not acceptable to some, if not all, of the then members of the partnership. Thereupon he, with others, commenced a third business known as the Dome, which was still in operation on April 18th, 1940.\nOn that date the store in which the Diana Sweets business was carried on and which was known by that name was destroyed by fire and it was in connection with that fire that Koufis was charged with arson. The basis for the charge was the evidence of Gerrior. He testified that Koufis had promised to pay him a sum of money to burn Diana Sweets and had said to him: \"If you are scared to do it, get somebody else and give him half the money \"; and that he (Gerrior) accordingly arranged with Pentecost to do the work. The latter testified that he in turn secured the assistance of Thistle. Both Pentecost and Thistle gave evidence that they set the premises on fire, and the learned trial judge, therefore, was quite accurate when he stated in his charge to the jury: \"so, if you give effect to that evidence, it is clear that somebody is guilty of the crime of arson.\"\nThe trial judge put to the jury as the crux of the case: \"Did the accused directly or through Gerrior procure Thistle and Pentecost to set the fire?\" He instructed the jury as to the danger of convicting upon the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice and also told them that there was no corroboration of the stories told by Gerrior, Pentecost and Thistle. The evidence of the last two did not implicate Koufis in any way but was admissible to prove the actual setting of the fire. Koufis was not charged with having conspired to commit arson and, as the trial judge explained, the actions of Pentecost and Thistle and the conversations between themselves were relevant to the charge upon which Koufis was being tried only if the jury were satisfied as to the truth of the evidence given by Gerrior relating to his conversations with the accused. On this point we are satisfied that the appeal could not succeed.\nTurning now to the first point, we find that when John Raptis, one of the partners in Diana Sweets and a witness on behalf of the Crown, was testifying in chief as to the conversation between him and the accused when the latter wanted to again become a partner in that business, the following occurred:\u2014\nQ. Tell us what he said.\nA. Lots of us down on Charlotte street and we get along very well. I never saw him until he got the Dome down to the Capital, and I met him one night before the first Dome was burned and he ask me \"You have to raise the price, no money in the meals\" and I say we are doing all right; and I saw him again after the fire, the first fire in the Dome.\nQ. A year ago?\nA. Two years ago in August.\nQ. It was before that first fire he complained to you about the prices?\nA. Yes, wanted to increase the prices. After he was at this Dome I never see him except in Church, just say \"hello.\"\nQ. You were not talking to him after the fire?\nA. No. This was the first mention in the evidence of any fire other than the one in question.\nThe following appears in the examination in chief of Gerrior when he was asked as to whether he had seen Koufis about two weeks before Christmas of 1939 after an accidental fire had occurred in Diana Sweets:\u2014\nA. Yes, two days after. I told him about it and he said \"Why did you not leave it burn\" and I said \"Why?\" and he said \"If you had leave it burn I would give you $50.\" I let it go at that. Couple of days after I met him and he asked me to go down and see him, and I did go down about twelve at night. He told me if I burn the Diana he would give me $350; he did not like them, they did not come up to his place and they were no good; he wanted them destroyed. He told me how it could foe done. He said \"You could burn it and nobody would suspect you because you are a fireman. When the other Dome burned nobody suspected the fireman and no questions asked to him.\"\nQ. Was he at the other Dome when it burned?\nA. He was running it.\nLater in his testimony in chief, in the course of an answer to a question, he stated: \"After the Dome Grill burned I went to see Koufis.\"\nTestifying on his own behalf, the accused, in answer to his own counsel and with reference to the Dome business, was asked:\u2014\nQ. And you were burned out?\nA. Yes.\nQ. What did you do then?\nA. We have heavy loss in the fire. We lose $5,000 and another $4,000. Either $9,000 or $10,000 altogether.\nIn cross-examination he was asked what he considered the Diana Sweets business was worth at the time he sold his interest in it.\nA. $28,000 or $27,000 besides the good will.\nQ. Was the Diana Sweets worth more then than at the time of your last fire?\nA. I don't know. That is for the time I was there.\nLater in cross-examination he was asked a number of questions as to the amount of insurance that had been carried on the Dome business at the time of a fire there. While we are not concerned with the evidence as to any fire at the Dome restaurant since no dissent is based on the admission of that evidence, I have referred to it in order to show how those fires came to be mentioned. Then followed the evidence with reference to the London Grill, upon which the dissent below has been based and which evidence I transcribe:\u2014\nQ. Did you own the London Grill?\nA. Yes, four partners.\nQ. What four partners?\nA. Roy Woodill, Russell Urquhart, myself and Gus Mandros.\nQ. That place burned too?\nA. Never.\nQ. Never a fire there?\nA. Never a fire there in the London Grill?\nQ. Do you mean the London Grill situated on the corner of Charlotte and Wentworth streets was never on fire at any time?\nA. Never have any claim for fire insurance.\nQ. Was there a fire there?\nA. Inside the store?\nQ. Yes.\nA. The London store never had a fire. The building next to it. There are two places there, the London Grill on one side and groceries on the other.\nQ. The two are under one roof?\nA. Absolutely.\nQ. And this fire was in the partition between the two?\nA. No, started at the end of the building.\nQ. Was it underneath the building the fire started?\nA. I don't know, the other end.\nQ. It was underneath the building, wasn't it?\nA. No, not in our basement.\nQ. Wasn't it underneath the building?\nA. I don't know.\nQ. Anyway, the building that the London Grill was in caught fire?\nA. Yes.\nThis was the only reference to a fire at or near the London Grill and the likely effect, if not the only effect, upon the jurymen of this line of cross-examination, particularly the questions \"Was it underneath the building the fire started\" and \"It was underneath the building, wasn't it\" and \"Wasn't it underneath the building,\" would be that the accused was a person who was very apt to commit the crime with which he was charged. In fact, the trial judge stated to the jury: \"The only reason he would be asked about another fire is to show he was likely to start this.\" Again there is no dissent as to the charge and I mention it merely to indicate that any doubt in the mind of the jury as to the purpose of these questions would be set at rest by this comment.\nBy section 4 of the Canada Evidence Act, every person charged with an offence is a competent witness for the defence, and by section 12, a witness may be questioned as to whether he has been convicted of any offence and upon being so questioned, if he either denies the fact or refuses to answer, the opposite party may prove such conviction. We are not concerned on this appeal with the question as to when the prosecution is entitled to give evidence of the bad character of an accused because it is not suggested that Koufis had been convicted of any crime in connection with the fire at the London Grill, or that he had been even charged with any such crime, or in fact that any crime had been committed by anyone. A person charged with having committed a crime is not only entitled to have placed before the jury only evidence that is relevant to the issues before the Court, but, when testifying on his own behalf, he may not be asked questions that have no possible bearing upon such issues and might only tend to prejudice a fair trial. In the opinion of the majority of the Supreme Court en banc, these questions were justified on the ground that they went to the credibility of the accused, but credibility cannot arise in connection with questions relating to an extraneous matter that has not been opened by the examination in chief of the accused or otherwise on his behalf. The conviction should be set aside and a new trial ordered.\nThe judgment of Rinfret, Crocket and Taschereau JJ. was delivered by\nTaschereau J.\u2014The appellant, William Koufis, has been found guilty of the crime of arson and sentenced to serve five years in Dorchester Penitentiary. The Court of Appeal for Nova Scotia confirmed this conviction (Hall and Archibald JJ. dissenting).\nThere is no suggestion that the accused set fire himself to the building called the Diana Sweets which was burned, but the contention of the Crown is that the accused hired one Jerome Gerrior to commit the crime and that the latter offered Clayton Pentecost one hundred and seventy-five dollars ($175), who shared this sum with Edward Thistle to burn the premises. The grounds of appeal are the following:\u2014\n1. The evidence of Clayton Pentecost and Edward Thistle, particularly with reference to their conversations with each other and Jerome Gerrior, was inadmissible in the trial against William Koufis and was improperly-admitted in evidence.\n2. The accused was greatly prejudiced in his defence by the publication and circulation in the City of Sydney and surrounding districts of a certain newspaper known as The Steelworker and Miner, which charged the accused with having committed the offence hereinbefore recited as well as imputing to him, the said William Koufis, the crime of arson in connection with fires which have occurred at premises known as the Dome Grill at Sydney, as well as with an alleged fire at premises known as the London Grill at Sydney, and an alleged fire in a bowling alley in Sydney.\n3. The learned prosecuting officer for the County of Cape Breton in cross-examining the accused improperly questioned him as to fires in the said Dome Grill and the London Grill, which greatly prejudiced the accused with the jury.\nI believe that the first ground of appeal is unfounded. It is well settled law that any acts done or words spoken in furtherance of the common design may be given in evidence against all (Paradis v. The King[2]). This rule applies to all indictments for crime, and not only when the indictment is for conspiracy, and it also applies even if the conspirator whose words or acts are tendered as evidence has not been indicted (Cloutier v. The King[3]). These principles were properly applied to the present case, and I believe that the conversations between Gerrior, Pentecost and Thistle were rightly admitted in evidence.\nThe appellant further submits that even if such an evidence is legal, there must be some independent evidence of conspiracy before the statements of co-conspirators, become admissible one against the other. Although the pronouncements on this ground have not always been unanimous, the matter has been definitely settled in the case of The King v. Paradis, cited supra, and which was based on a decision rendered by the Supreme Court of British Columbia (The King v. Hutchinson[4]). In the case of Paradis v. The King[5], Mr. Justice Rinfret, giving the judgment of the Court, said:\u2014\nNor would it be error for a trial judge to permit proof of acts of alleged conspiracy to be given in evidence before the agreement to conspire has been established, if the latter is in fact proved during the course of the trial.\nThe second point raised by the appellant is that the accused has been prejudiced by the publication of certain articles in The Steelworker and Miner.\nThe articles complained of were certainly of a serious character, as they clearly stated that the appellant was the party responsible for several fires which occurred in Sydney some time before the trial. These articles, however, were not referred to at the trial and were put in the record only when the case reached the Court of Appeal. An affidavit was filed signed by I. J. MacLeod to the effect that The Steelworker and Miner is widely circulated throughout the County of Cape Breton and the City of Sydney; but there is nothing in the record or the evidence to show that the members of the jury had any knowledge of the contents of these articles nor that they did not give a free unbiased verdict. Under these circumstances, I am of opinion that the appellant cannot succeed on this point.\nThe third ground of appeal is much more serious and is obviously the one on which the appellant practically rests his whole case. It raises the question of the cross-examination of the accused by the solicitor for the respondent on previous fires which occurred at the Dome Grill and at the London Grill at Sydney. The learned judges, however, do not enter a formal dissent as to the cross-examination on the fire which destroyed the Dome Grill, but they dissent on the ground that the accused has been improperly cross-examined as to the alleged fire at the London Grill. The Canada Evidence Act, section 12, says:\u2014\nA witness may be questioned as to whether he has been convicted of any offence, and upon being so questioned, if he either denies the fact or refuses to answer, the opposite party may prove such conviction.\nIf the accused admits having committed the offence, the answer, being a collateral one, is obviously final. If he denies having committed the offence, then the conviction may be proved by legal means provided for in subsection 2, paragraphs (a) and (b), of section 12. The authority given to the Grown is to cross-examine the accused on previous convictions, but this section 12 cannot be interpreted as meaning that the accused may be cross-examined on offences which he is suspected of having committed but for which he has not been convicted.\nWhen an accused is tried before the Criminal Courts, he has to answer the specific charge mentioned in the indictment for which he is standing on trial, \"and the evidence must be limited to matters relating to the transaction which forms the subject of the indictment\" (Maxwell v. Director of Public Prosecutions[6]). Otherwise, \"the real issue may be distracted from the minds of the jury,\" and an atmosphere of guilt may be created which would indeed prejudice the accused.\nIn the present case, the accused was asked in cross-examination if he had owned the London Grill? If that place had burned too? If the fire had started underneath the building? All these questions were obviously asked in order to convey to the jury the impression that the accused had set fire previously to another building, and to establish the possibility that he committed the offence for which he is now charged. The accused cannot be cross-examined on other criminal acts supposed to have been committed by him, unless he has been convicted, or unless these acts are connected with the offence charged and tend to prove it (Paradis v. The King[7]), or unless they show a system or a particular intention as decided in Brunei v. The King[8]. It is clear to my mind that this cross-examination may have influenced the verdict of the jury and caused the accused a substantial wrong.\nI would allow the appeal and direct a new trial.\nAppeal allowed and new trial ordered.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J.

R. Walker, in order to accommodate Walker Press Limited, provided, as collateral security for certain indebtedness of the latter to the respondent bank, a certificate in his name for 150 shares of the South Shore Lumber Company and $10,000 of bonds of the Back River Power Company. On October 31st, 1932, an agreement was entered into between Walker Press Limited, as vendors, E. S. Alger as purchaser, and Walker Paper Company, Kruger Paper Company, The Royal Bank of Canada and Barclays Bank (Canada), as intervenants, by the terms of which Walker Press Limited sold its assets and business as a going concern to E. S. Alger, in consideration of the payment and satisfaction of all the obligations of the latter in respect of the lease of the premises occupied by it and in respect of the debts and liabilities of the vendor mentioned in a certain list attached thereto. Alger further undertook to cause a new company to be incorporated and to transfer to that company all the assets conveyed to him, subject to the above mentioned liabilities, and to invest $2,000 in cash in the new company; he was also to cause the new company to create and issue bonds of the par value of $19,000, secured on all the assets acquired from Walker Press Limited as well as upon all future assets of the new company, these bonds to be delivered to Walker Press Limited within 30 days from the date of the agreement. Walker Press Limited undertook to surrender its charter within a reasonable time after the receipt of the bonds and deliver them to the intervenants pro rata and in proportion to their respective claims, Alger acknowledging that he was already in possession of all the assets of Walker Press Limited. Then the agreement contained the following clause: The intervenants (above mentioned) agreed with the Walker Press Limited, vendors and Alger, purchaser, \"that when the said bonds of the new company, hereinabove mentioned, shall have been issued and delivered to the Walker Press Company or its representative or representatives that they individually will accept a pro rata amount of the said bonds proportionate to their respective claims against the Walker Press in full settlement and satisfaction of any and all claims they may have against the Walker Press and the purchaser directly or indirectly, save that inasmuch as the Royal Bank of Canada and Barclay's Bank (Canada) and the Kruger Paper Co. Limited hold certain securities as collateral security against the amounts due them by the Walker Press, it is understood that the said banks and the Kruger Paper Co. Ltd., shall be entitled to continue to hold and\/or realize upon such security until and unless their said claims are paid in full through the payment of the said bonds or otherwise, it being understood that the present agreement shall not in any way interfere with the rights of the said banks and Kruger Paper Co. Ltd. in respect of said collateral security.\"\nPursuant to the agreement, Alger caused the new company to be incorporated, and the bonds were created and delivered to Walker Press Ltd.; but, before they were issued, S. R. Alger, a brother of the purchaser, submitted to the respondent bank an option to purchase the bonds to which they were entitled as a result of the agreement, for the sum of $2,81154. The option was accepted and carried out. The bank received the sum of $2,811.24 and surrendered to S. R. Alger its rights to the bond of $14,056.20, which it would otherwise have received. Subsequently, by their action, the executors of James R. Walker claimed that the debt for which the collateral security had been given was extinguished and that they were entitled to recover from the respondent bank the 150 shares of the South Shore Lumber & Builders Supplies Ltd and the $10,000 bonds of the Back River Power Company. At the same time, Barclays (Canada) Limited, an assignee of the bank, brought an action to compel the completion of the transfer of the South Shore Company's share certificate in its name. The Superior Court, applying articles 1171, 1173 and 1174 C.C., held \"that the agreement of 1932 (did) not create novation; that the Walker Press was discharged only with the reserve that the Bank would hold or realize upon the collateral security until the claim of the Bank was paid in full * * *, it being understood that the agreement would in no way interfere with the rights of the bank in respect of the said collateral security\u2014a stipulation which amounts to say that the bank renounces to any personal recourse against the Walker Press Limited, but the debt is not extinguished, since the bank has the right to sell the collateral in payment of the debt.\" The judgment of the Superior Court was affirmed by the appellate court, which decided that the respondent bank was entitled to hold the collateral securities: the action of the appellants was therefore dismissed and, consequently, the action of. Barclays (Canada), respondent in the second appeal, to have the transfer completed in its favour, was maintained.\nHeld that the judgment appealed from should be affirmed. The intention of the parties to the agreement above mentioned was not to effect novation: as stated in article 1171 C.C., novation is never presumed and the intention to effect it must be evident. By force of article 1173 C.C., even if the agreement should be interpreted as one by which Walker Press Limited gave to the respondent bank a new debtor who obligated himself towards the bank, such delegation did not effect novation \"unless it is evident that the creditor intends to discharge the debtor who makes the delegation.\" The alleged full and complete discharge to the Walker Press Limited was, in reality, only a qualified discharge. Undoubtedly the intervenants were giving up any right to claim against Walker Press Limited personally and any right to be paid out of the general assets of Walker Press Limited, except in so far as the bonds which they were getting from Alger Printing Company (the new company) were to be secured upon those assets through the trust deed executed in connection with the issue of the bonds. But their rights upon the collateral securities remained untrammelled and, to the extent that the existence of the debt of Walker Press Limited was necessary for the purpose of preserving to the collateral security the character of a legal pledge, that debt was to remain in existence. It could no longer be claimed as a personal debt against the Walker Press Limited, it could not have been realized against the latter's general assets, but it subsisted as a debt which could be realized against the collateral securities. It became a claim propter rem.\nAPPEALS from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming two judgments of the Superior Court, Philippe Demers J., rendered in two actions which were joined at the trial, the trial judge dismissing an action taken by the appellants as executors of the estate of the late J. R. Walker against the respondent bank for the return to them of shares and bonds which had been pledged with the respondent by a company known as the Walker Press Limited as general security for that company's indebtedness to the respondent as its banker, and the trial judge maintaining an action by the respondent, in the second appeal, so that the latter be declared to be the only owner of the shares and ordering the transfer of these shares in the books of that company.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. and H. N. Chauvin K.C. for the appellants.\nLs. St-Laurent K.C. and W. C. Nicholson K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014These are two appeals by the testamentary executors of the late James Robert Walker from judgments rendered against them by the Superior Court of the province of Quebec, sitting in Montreal and the Court of King's Bench (appeal side) of that province.\nThe decision in each of them depends on the solution to be given to identical questions of law, and, in point of fact, on the construction of the same document. They were submitted to this Court on the same argument and may be conveniently disposed of on the same set of reasons.\nThe late James Robert Walker, in order to accommodate Walker Press Limited, provided, as collateral security for certain indebtedness of the latter to the respondent bank, the following:\n(a) a certificate in the name of J. R. Walker for 150 shares of the common stock of the South Shore Lumber Company (now the South Shore Lumber & Builders Supplies Limited);\n(b) $10,000 of the 6% bearer bonds due 1st January, 1941, of the Back River Power Company.\nOn October 31st, 1932, an agreement was entered into between Walker Press Limited, as vendors, E. S. Alger of Oshawa, Ont., as purchaser, and Walker Paper Company, Kruger Paper Company Limited, The Royal Bank of Canada, and Barclays Bank (Canada), as intervenants, by the terms of which Walker Press Limited sold its assets and business as a going concern to E. S. Alger, in consideration, amongst others, of the said Alger providing for the payment of the debts of Walker Press, as will later be more fully explained.\nIn the first action, the appellants prayed for the delivery to them of the 150 shares of the South Shore Lumber & Builders Supplies Limited and of the $10,000 of bonds of the Back River Power Company, or, in the alternative, for the payment to them of the equivalent value of these securities; and further for an order to the mis-en-cause to make the requisite entries in its books to give effect to the judgment to be rendered.\nIn the second action, instituted by Barclays (Canada) Limited, it was stated that, for the purpose of realizing upon its security, the respondent bank sold and transferred the 150 shares of the South Shore Company to Barclays (Canada) Limited; and the conclusion is that Barclays (Canada) Limited be declared the true and only owner of the shares, and that the estate of James R. Walker be condemned to do all things and sign and execute all documents necessary to complete the transfer of the shares on the books of the mis-en-cause, failing which the mis-en-cause be authorized and ordered to register the necessary transfer upon service of a copy of the judgment to be rendered and to issue to Barclays (Canada) Limited a new certificate in its name for the shares in question.\nThe agreement of October 31st, 1932, provided for the sale by Walker Press Limited and the purchase by E. S. Alger of all the business and assets of Walker Press Limited, in consideration of the payment and satisfaction of all the obligations of the latter in respect of the lease of the premises occupied by it and in respect of the debts and liabilities of the vendor mentioned in a certain list attached thereto. Alger further undertook to cause a new company to be incorporated and to transfer to that company all the assets conveyed to him, subject to the above mentioned liabilities; and to invest $2,000 in cash in the new company. He was to cause the new company to create and issue bonds of the par value of $19,000 secured on all the assets acquired from Walker Press Limited, as well as upon all future assets of the new company, as a first floating charge by way of hypothec, mortgage, pledge, cession and transfer. These bonds of $19,000 were to be delivered to Walker Press Limited within thirty days from the date of the agreement.\nWalker Press Limited undertook to surrender its charter within a reasonable time after the receipt of the bonds and to divide the bonds and deliver them to the intervenants pro rata and in proportion to their respective claims.\nAlger acknowledged that he was already in possession of all the assets of Walker Press Limited.\nThen comes the following clause on which the whole litigation turns:\nAnd the said intervenants hereunto intervening, having taken communication of the foregoing provisions of the present agreement, individually acknowledge that the said agreement is made in fulfilment of an agreement between them and the said E. S. Alger set forth in a letter to him dated the 8th of July, 1932, and the said intervenants agree with the parties of the first and second part that when the said bonds of the new company, hereinabove mentioned, shall have been issued and delivered to the Walker Press Company or its representative or representatives that they individually will accept a pro rata amount of the said bonds proportionate to their respective claims against the Walker Press in full settlement and satisfaction of any and all claims they may have against the Walker Press and the purchaser directly or indirectly, save that inasmuch as the Royal Bank of Canada and Barclays Bank (Canada) and the Kruger Paper Co. Limited hold certain securities as collateral security against the amounts due them by the Walker Press, it is understood that the said banks and the Kruger Paper Co. Ltd., shall foe entitled to continue to hold and\/or realize upon such security until and unless their said claims are paid in full through the payment of the said bonds or otherwise, it being understood that the present agreement shall not in any way interfere with the rights of the said banks and Kruger Paper Co. Ltd. in respect of the said collateral security.\nPursuant to the agreement, Alger caused the new company to be incorporated, and the bonds were created and delivered to Walker Press Ltd.; but, before they were issued, S. R. Alger, a brother of the purchaser, submitted to the respondent bank an option to purchase the bonds to which they were entitled as a result of the agreement, for the sum of $2,811.24. The option was accepted and carried out. The bank received the sum of $2,811.24 and surrendered to S. R. Alger its rights to the bond of $14,056.20, which it would otherwise have received.\nAs a consequence, the executors of James R. Walker claimed that the debt for which the collateral security had been given was extinguished and that they were entitled to recover from the bank the 150 shares of the South Shore Lumber & Builders Supplies Ltd. and the $10,000 bonds of the Back River Power Company. At the same time, Barclays (Canada) Limited, as assignee of the bank, brought its action to compel the completion of the transfer of the South Shore Company's share certificate in its name.\nThe Superior Court (Demers J.) and the majority of the Court of King's Bench held that the debt to the bank had not yet been paid, was not extinguished, and that the bank was, therefore, entitled to hold the collateral securities, and the action of the Walker estate was dismissed. Consequently the action of Barclays (Canada) Limited to have the transfer completed in its favour was maintained.\nSt-Germain J., in the Court of King's Bench, dissented. He was of opinion that the agreement of October 31st, 1932, created a novation in respect of the debt to the respondent bank and that, by releasing the bond of the Alger Company, the bank had caused the principal debt to be extinguished and the debtor to disappear, thereby becoming obliged to return the collateral security to the Walker estate.\nIt is now our duty to decide whether both courts below have erred in their interpretation of the agreement to which the intervenants, and amongst them the respondent bank, have given their consent.\nThe Superior Court referred to articles 1171, 1173 and 1174 of the Civil Code. They read as follows:\n1171. Novation is not presumed. The intention to effect it must be evident.\n1173. The delegation by which a debtor gives to his creditor a new debtor who obliges himself toward the creditor does not effect novation, unless it is evident that the creditor intends to discharge the debtor who makes the delegation.\n1174. The simple indication by the debtor of a person who is to pay in his place, or the simple indication by the creditor of a person who is to receive in his place, or the transfer of a debt with or without the acceptance of the debtor, does not effect novation.\nApplying these articles, the Superior Court held\nthat the agreement of 1932 (did) not create novation; that the Walker Press was discharged only with the reserve that the bank would hold or realize upon the collateral security until the claim of the bank was paid in full * * * it being understood that the agreement would in no way interfere with the rights of the bank in respect of the said collateral security\u2014a stipulation which amounts to say that the bank renounces to any personal recourse against the Walker Press Limited, but the debt is not extinguished, since the bank has the right to sell the collateral in payment of the debt.\nThe Court held that such a stipulation was legal. If it were not, by article 1080 C.C., the whole agreement would be null.\nThe Court added that\nby the said agreement, E. S. Alger did not oblige himself to pay said debt to the bank, but promised to give a further guarantee to the bank by issuing bonds, which obligation he has fulfilled to their satisfaction.\nThe Court of King's Bench found no error in that judgment and confirmed it purely and simply, St-Germain J. dissenting, as already stated.\nBy what may be called the intervention clause, the intervenants agreed with Walker Press and with E. S. Alger, that, when the bonds would have been issued and delivered to the Walker Press Company, or its representatives, they individually would accept a pro rata amount of the bonds proportionate to their respective claims against the Walker Press\nin full settlement and satisfaction of any and all claims they may have against the Walker Press and the purchaser (E. S. Alger) directly or indirectly, save that inasmuch as * * * Barclays Bank (Canada) * * * hold certain securities as collateral security against the amounts due them by the Walker Press, it is understood that the said bank * * * shall be entitled to continue to hold and\/or realize upon such security until and unless their said claims are paid in full through the payment of the said bonds or otherwise; it being understood that the present agreement shall not in any way interfere with the rights of the said bank * * * in respect of the said collateral security.\nThe rights which the bank possessed \"in respect of said collateral security\" are evidenced by the hypothecation thereof made on November 29th, 1931, and of which a copy was filed in the record. The collateral securities were stated to be held by the bank as a pledge to secure all advances presently made or which at any time thereafter may be made to Walker Press Limited. It was agreed that, in default being made in repaying any advance or any part thereof, when due, or on failure to comply with any demand for payment, or if any security should, in the opinion of the bank, depreciate in value, the bank could, without notice, without advertisement and without any other formality, all of which are declared waived, sell the collaterals, or any of them on any recognized exchange, or by public or private sale. The bank was not to be responsible for any loss occasioned by any sale of any collateral, or by the retention of or refusal to sell the same. The bank or its manager was made the attorney irrevocable of the Walker Press Limited and could transfer all or any of the collaterals, or fill in all blanks in any transfer of stock, bonds or debentures, or any power of attorney or document delivered to it, and the bank could delegate its powers and its delegate could sub-delegate the same.\nAt the request of the bank, Walker Press Limited was to execute all transfers and documents which may be reasonably required, with all powers of sale and other necessary powers as may be expedient for vesting in the bank, or such person or persons as it may appoint, all or every such collaterals.\nIf any payment on account of the advance be made the bank shall not by reason thereof be required to surrender any of the collateral pledged.\nObviously, the main object of the intervention of the bank in the agreement of 1932 was to give the bank's consent to the sale by the Walker Press Limited of all its assets (bulk sale), under articles 1569 (a) & seq. of the Civil Code, to E. S. Alger\u2014a sale which otherwise could not have been made to the prejudice of the Walker Press' creditors.\nThe intention was not to effect novation. As stated in art. 1171 C.C., novation is never presumed and the intention to effect it must be evident.\nHere, by force of art. 1173 C.C., even if the agreement should be interpreted as one by which Walker Press Limited gave to the bank a new debtor who obliged himself towards the bank, such delegation did not effect novation \"unless it is evident that the creditor intends to discharge the debtor who makes the delegation.\" Otherwise, the simple indication by the Walker Press of a person who was to pay in its place did not effect novation (Art. 1174 C.C.).\nThe words in the intervention clause:\nin full settlement and satisfaction of any and all claims they may have against the Walker Press and the purchaser directly or indirectly,\nif the stipulation stopped there, would of course be decisive of the present case; but these words are qualified by what follows; and what follows is a saving condition, which would have no meaning unless it is understood to mean what the learned trial judge has held to be the true construction of the agreement. The qualification is that, inasmuch as the bank holds certain collateral securities against the amounts due by the Walker Press, it is understood that the bank shall be entitled to continue to hold and to realize upon such securities until and unless their \"said claims are paid in full through the payment of the said bonds or otherwise.\"\nThe words \"said claims\" are evidently the claims against Walker Press Limited. The words \"or otherwise\" mean that the parties contemplated that these \"claims\" might be paid either through the payment of the bonds or in some other way. The bond issued by the new company, delivered to Walker Press Limited and, in turn, remitted to the respondent bank, was not, therefore, to be the only means through which the bank could expect payment of its debt against the Walker Press.\nMoreover, the clause goes on to say:\nit being understood that the present agreement shall not in any way interfere with the rights of the said bank * * * in respect of the said collateral security.\nAnd, as we have seen, the rights of the bank in respect of the collateral security were that the bank could sell them on a recognized exchange, or by public or private sale, in order to satisfy its claim against Walker Press Limited. The bank could realize upon these collaterals or allow them to be sold and was not to be responsible for any loss occasioned by any sale. Further, any substituted collaterals would be held by the bank subject to the same terms and conditions and with the same powers and authorities.\nIt was not E. S. Alger himself, but it was the new company that he was to form, which undertook to issue the bonds; and the bonds were not to be issued in favour of the intervenants, including the respondent bank, but they were to be issued and given to Walker Press Limited purely and simply in payment of the assets and the business purchased by Alger.\nThe true meaning of the intervention by the larger creditors was that they consented to the wholesale transfer of the assets and the business of Walker Press to Alger (which could not have legally been made without such consent); but, although they were, of course, willing to receive the bonds of the new company, and they would, in consideration for receiving same, relieve Walker Press of its personal obligations towards them, they made it quite distinctly understood that their rights in the collateral securities were to be in no way interfered with. And that means that such rights would remain absolutely intact, to guarantee the claim already in existence against Walker Press as well as the additional claim which they would acquire against Alger Printing Company, when they would become the holders of the bonds. This is clearly expressed in the clause by the words \"shall be entitled to continue to hold and\/or realize upon such security until and unless their said claims are paid in full through the payment of the said bonds or otherwise.\" Henceforth the bank and the larger creditors were to have a claim both as a result of holding the bonds \"or otherwise\"; and the agreement was not \"in any way\" to interfere with the rights of these larger creditors \"in respect of the said collateral securities.\" They would have been interfered with in some way if the collateral securities were not to guarantee the full original claim against Walker Press and were afterwards to guarantee only the payment of the bonds. In other words, the intervenants intended to preserve their full rights to be paid out of the proceeds of the collateral securities, until and unless they had been otherwise paid of their debt.\nSo that the alleged full and complete discharge to the Walker Press was, in reality, only a qualified discharge. Undoubtedly the intervenants were giving up any right to claim against Walker Press personally and any right to be paid out of the general assets of Walker Press, except in so far as the bonds which they were getting from Alger Printing Company were to be secured upon those assets through the trust deed executed in connection with the issue of the bonds.\nBut their rights upon the collateral securities remained untrammelled and, to the extent that the existence of the debt of Walker Press was necessary for the purpose of preserving to the collateral security the character of a legal pledge, that debt was to remain in existence. It could no longer be claimed as a personal debt against the Walker Press, it could not have been realized against the latter's general assets, but it subsisted as a debt which could be realized against the collateral securities. It became a claim propter rem.\nTrue it is that the stipulation in the agreement whereby the Walker Press undertook to surrender its charter supplies a difficulty in the interpretation adopted by the trial judge and by the Court of King's Bench; but the construction of the agreement may not depend upon this stipulation taken alone and isolated from the remainder of the document. The agreement must be interpreted as a whole. There is to be found in it the clear intention of preserving all the rights of the creditors against the collateral security, and, of necessity, the intention that the Walker Press' indebtedness should subsist in so far as necessary to keep the pledge alive.\nIt follows that we are in agreement with the conclusions of the judgments appealed from.\nThe consequence is that when Walker Press delivered the bonds to the respondent bank, either physically or constructively, in compliance with the agreement, it was getting relieved of the personal obligation it had incurred towards the respondent bank in so far as that obligation may have authorized the bank to realize against the general assets of. Walker Press; but it was not otherwise relieved of its obligation in so far as it could be realized against the collateral security. There was no intention to effect novation in that respect; and, at all events, such intention was far from being evident, or such as to meet the requirements of the Civil Code. The respondent bank sold the bond of the Alger Printing Company for an amount less than the total indebtedness of Walker Press Limited. In view of what we have already said, this bond could well be considered, as it has been by the two courts below, as a further guarantee or security to the bank. Under the terms of the hypothecation of the collateral securities, this additional security was held by the bank \"subject to the same terms and conditions and with the same powers and authorities\" as had been conferred in respect of the original collaterals. The bank could sell these collaterals, or any of them, by private sale. And it was not to be responsible towards Walker Press \"for any loss occasioned by any sale of any collateral.\" Both the trial court and the appellate court came to the conclusion that\nIl semble bien, d'apr\u00e8s la preuve, qu'il n'aurait gu\u00e8re \u00e9t\u00e9 possible de trouver acheteur \u00e0 un prix plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 pour ces bons.\nThese findings are fully warranted by the evidence. At all events, the burden of proving the contrary fell upon the appellants, and they have failed to discharge that burden.\nWe have given every consideration to the very able argument of counsel for the appellants and we find ourselves unable to come to a conclusion different from that reached by the judgments appealed from, which should, therefore, be confirmed with costs.\nAppeals dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Chauvin, Walker, Stewart & Martineau.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Magee, Nicholson & O'Donnell.\n",

(ibid) dismissing her action, which was brought for relief for alleged breach of trust.\nUnder the will of her father, who died on October 18, 1929, appellant was entitled, during a certain period after her father\u2019s decease, to part, and after expiration of said period, to the whole, of the revenue from a trust fund to be set apart by the trustees and executors of the will; should appellant become a widow, she was to receive the corpus of the fund, but if she died without having become a widow, the fund was to go to her brothers.\nThe trust fund was partially set up in December, 1929, and was completed in 1936. In the action, commenced in March, 1937, against the executors and trustees of the will, appellant alleged that a certain mortgage, included in the partial set up of the fund in December, 1929, was not a proper security to have been included therein. There was no allegation of fraud or fraudulent breach of trust.\nHeld (per Rinfret, Kerwin, Hudson and Taschereau JJ.): As the action was commenced more than six years after the alleged breach of trust occurred, it was barred by s. 46 (2) of The Limitations Act (R.S.O., 1937, c. 118). Appellant did not come within the proviso in s. 46 (2) (b) that the statute of limitations \u201cshall not begin to run against any beneficiary unless and until the interest of such beneficiary becomes an interest in possession.\u201d So far as the revenue from the trust fund was concerned, appellant\u2019s interest was one in possession; and, that being so, it could not be said that, because she had only a contingent interest in the corpus of the fund, she came within said proviso. The proviso is not intended to protect an interest in rem but a beneficiary. Appellant\u2019s cause of action, if it existed, arose when her interest as the person entitled to the income or part of it was an interest in possession, and the lapse of time had barred her claim for the alleged breach of trust, even though she might be entitled to a further interest in the property in the future. (Hudson J. held also that, on the evidence, appellant must fail on the ground that her action was barred by a certain agreement of August 7, 1931, made for the purpose of settling matters in dispute between her and the defendants).\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] dismissing her appeal from the judgment of Hogg J.1\nThe plaintiff was a beneficiary under the will of her father who died on October 18, 1929. The defendants were executors and trustees of the will; and two of them were brothers of the plaintiff and were the residuary legatees under the will. The action, commenced on March 19, 1937, was for relief for alleged breach of trust. (The defendant Harry Alcroft Thompson died on May 16, 1939, since the trial of the action; and the defendant Stanley Alexander Thompson was appointed administrator ad litem of his estate).\nBy the will the testator gave all his estate to his executors and trustees upon certain trusts, one of which was to set apart for the benefit of the plaintiff the sum of $100,000 and to keep the same invested in good legal securities and to pay to her the sum of $2,500 per year out of the net revenue thereof, for a period of the first ten years after the testator\u2019s decease, and after the expiration of said period of ten years she was to receive the full revenue from said $100,000, together with any increase that there might be to the same owing to her receiving only a portion of the net revenue therefrom for the said period of ten years. The full net revenue was to be paid to her for the balance of her life only. Should she become a widow then she should receive the corpus. After her death without having become a widow, the said bequest so set apart for her benefit should revert and become part of the residue of the estate and be divided equally between the testator\u2019s two sons.\nIn December, 1929, assets representing the sum of $60,000 were set apart as part of the plaintiff\u2019s trust fund. In the action the plaintiff alleged that a certain mortgage for $30,000, included in these assets so set apart, was not a proper security to have been included therein, and that defendants failed in their duty as trustees in allocating this mortgage to the plaintiff\u2019s trust fund.\nThe defendants completed the whole of the trust fund in 1936.\nThere was an agreement dated August 7, 1931, for the purpose of settling matters in dispute between the plaintiff and the defendants. In the action the plaintiff asked that this agreement be set aside for the reason that she did not have independent advice and was not aware, when she executed the agreement, of the state or condition of the property covered by said mortgage for $30,000 allocated to her trust fund and approved by her under the terms of the agreement as part of the fund. The trial judge, Hogg J., dismissed the action[2]. He held that the facts and circumstances present in the case were such that the defendants, as trustees, were protected from liability by s. 46 of The Limitations Act (now R.S.O., 1937, c. 118), there having elapsed over seven years from the time when, according to the plaintiff\u2019s claim, the defendants acted in violation of the trust, until the issue of the writ in the action. He dealt also, however, with other questions which were raised in the action and decided them in favour of the defendants. As to the said agreement of August 7, 1931, he held that the plaintiff\u2019s actions subsequent to the date of her execution of that agreement, and the length of time which had elapsed since she acquired knowledge of the matters with respect to which she now complained, were sufficient to show conclusively that she acquiesced in the agreement and its terms and that she elected to abide by it.\nIn the Court of Appeal2, McTague J.A., with whom Robertson C.J.O. agreed, based his judgment, dismissing the appeal, upon s. 46 of The Limitations Act (R.S.O., 1937, c. 118), which, he held, applied and was an answer to the plaintiff\u2019s claim. Fisher J.A. agreed with McTague J.A. as to the action being barred by the statute; and he also held that the agreement of August 7, 1931, was a bar; that plaintiff had approved the agreement, received and accepted benefits thereunder, acquiesced in its terms and elected to be bound by it.\nThe plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nR.L. Kellock K.C. and J.E. Tansey for the appellant.\nD.L. McCarthy K.C. and K.G. Morden for the respondent Chartered Trust and Executor Company.\nJ.L.G. Keogh for the respondent Thompson.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2014I concur with the judgment dismissing the appeal with costs.\nThe judgment of Rinfret, Kerwin and Taschereau JJ. was delivered by\nKERWIN J.\u2014Under the terms of the will of her father the appellant was entitled, during the first ten years after his decease, to part of the revenue from a trust fund which he directed his executors and trustees to set apart. After the expiration of the ten years, the appellant was entitled to the entire revenue. Should she become a widow, she was entitled to the corpus of the fund but, if she died prior to becoming a widow, the fund was to be divided equally between her brothers. The latter and a trust company were named executors and trustees of the will and are the respondents in the present appeal. These executors and trustees set aside certain securities to constitute part of the fund, among them being a mortgage which the appellant as plaintiff in this action claimed was not a proper trust security and sued the respondents for breach of trust.\nThe trust fund was partially set up on December 12th, 1929, and the claim is that the breach of trust occurred at that time. As the respondents subsequently completed the fund and have retained nothing from it, I agree with Mr. Justice McTague when he observes: \u201cIt may be a case of improperly constituting the fund, but it is not a case of retention.\u201d Hence the action is not one to recover trust property or the proceeds thereof retained by the trustees or previously received by them and converted to their use, as mentioned in subsection 2 of section 46 of The Limitations Act, R.S.O., 1937, c. 118; nor is there any allegation of fraud or fraudulent breach of trust.\nThe action having been commenced more than six years after December 12th, 1929, it is barred by virtue of clause (b) of subsection 2 unless the appellant is brought within the following words of that clause:\u2014\nbut so nevertheless that the statute * * * shall not begin to run against any beneficiary unless and until the interest of such beneficiary becomes an interest in possession.\nSo far as the revenue from the trust fund is concerned, the appellant\u2019s interest was one in possession, and it was admitted by Mr. Kellock that her claim with respect to such revenue was barred, but he argued that that bar does not extend to the appellant\u2019s contingent interest in the corpus of the fund. For that contention he relied upon the remarks of North J. in Mara v. Browne[3], at pages 95 and 97. The decision in that case was reversed on another ground[4], and the Court of Appeal, therefore, did not deal with this point. It is a difficult one but, upon consideration, I am of opinion that the proviso in clause (b) is not intended to protect an interest in rem but a beneficiary. The appellant\u2019s cause of action, if it existed, arose when her interest as the person entitled to the income or part of it was an interest in possession, and the lapse of time has barred her claim for the alleged breach of trust, even though she may be entitled to a further interest in the property in the future.\nThis is sufficient to dispose of the appeal, which should be dismissed with costs. I say nothing one way or the other as to the other questions argued before us.\nHUDSON J.\u2014I agree that the plaintiff must fail in this action on the grounds stated by Mr. Justice McTague in the Court of Appeal. I am also of the opinion that the plaintiff must fail on the ground that her action is barred by the agreement of 7th August, 1931. It appears from the evidence that this agreement was in the nature of a family settlement; its terms were settled after protracted negotiations between her brothers, herself and the Trust Company. It also appears from the evidence that she is an intelligent and competent business woman and I quite agree with the learned trial judge and Mr. Justice Fisher in the Court of Appeal that she understood the agreement, and her subsequent conduct confirms this. She accepted benefits under the agreement which she would not otherwise have been entitled to, and this action was not commenced until more than five years after the agreement was made and until after the death of Mr. W.S. Morden, the official of the Trust Company who had the active management of the estate and who was the only official with whom the appellant had any interviews before negotiations leading up to the agreement. If the plaintiff ever had any right to complain, she acquiesced in what was done and should not now receive the aid of a court of equity.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Lamport, Ferguson & Co.\nSolicitors for the respondent Thompson: Hughes, Agar & Thompson.\nSolicitors for the respondent Chartered Trust and Executor Company: Armstrong & Sinclair.\n[1] [1940] O.R. 201; [1940] 2 D.L.R. 619.\n[2] [1940] O.R. 201; [1940] 2 D.L.R. 619.\n[3] [1895] 2 Ch. 69.\n[4] [1896] 1 Ch. 199.\n",

The deceased suffered from diabetes and took insulin therefor. One morning he took (as found by inference from the evidence) the usual dose, later in the day became very ill, from, according to evidence given, an \"insulin reaction,\" and died three days later. The policy by its terms insured against (inter alia) death resulting from \"bodily injuries, effected directly and independently of all other causes, through external, violent and accidental means.\" Sec. 5 (in force at the time of deceased's death) of the New Brunswick Accident Insurance Act provided that \"in every contract of accident insurance, the event insured against shall include any bodily injury occasioned by external force or agency, and happening without the direct intent of the person injured, or as the indirect result of his intentional act * * *\"\nHeld: Plaintiff was entitled to recover. Though deceased's diabetic condition co-acted with the insulin, yet, on the true construction of the policy and said s. 5 of the Act, there was only one cause of death (Fidelity and Casualty Company of New York v. Mitchell, [1917] A.C. 592, at 597), viz., the bodily injury, sustained as a result of the taking of the insulin. The bodily injury (the event insured against) was occasioned by external agency and happened without deceased's direct intent, within the meaning of said s. 5.\nJudgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division, 15 M.P.R. 418, reversed. (Crocket J. dissenting).\nPer Crocket J. (dissenting): The effect of the judgment of this Court on the former appeal in this action ([1938] S.C.R. 234, which ordered a new trial) was that, upon the proper construction of s. 5 of the Act, the external force or agency (in this case the injection of the insulin by the insured) which occasions the bodily injury, must be the proximate cause of the insured's death. Under the policy and the Act alike, the \"means\" or \"external force or agency\" must be at least accidental as well as external. The suggestion that s. 5 of the Act was intended to include as accidents, circumstances where the means is not accidental but intentional and an unintentional result follows, is contrary to the clear effect of said former judgment of this Court; and s. 5 cannot now foe regarded as doing away with the fundamental and universally recognized principle of accident insurance, viz., that the accident must be found in the \"means\" or (as expressed in said s. 5) in the \"external force or agency\" from which the bodily injury insured against has naturally and directly resulted.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division[1], which, reversing the, judgment of Richards J.[2], dismissed the action (Harrison J. dissenting).\nThe plaintiff's claim in the action was as beneficiary under a policy of insurance issued by the defendant insuring the plaintiff's husband against (inter alia) death resulting from \"bodily injuries, effected directly and independently of all other causes, through external, violent and accidental means.\"\nThe insured suffered from diabetes and took insulin therefor. As found by inference from the evidence (there being no direct evidence of the fact), he took insulin on the morning of February 26, 1933. Later on that day he became very ill, and he died on March 1, 1933. Plaintiff's statement of claim alleged that deceased \"accidentally and by mistake took a dose [amended to read \"an overdose\"] of insulin as a result whereof and not otherwise\" the deceased came to his death. The trial judge, Richards J., found that there was no evidence that deceased took an overdose, or from which an inference could be drawn that he took an overdose, of insulin; that the only possible inference was that the normal dose or quantity was taken (and was taken intentionally); and this finding was agreed with in the Appeal Division and in this Court. There was evidence given to the effect that deceased, after taking the insulin, suffered an \"insulin reaction,\" which caused conditions resulting in his death.\nOn the question of defendant's liability, there were involved questions with regard to the construction, application and effect of s. 5 of the Accident Insurance Act, R.S.N.B., 1927, c. 85; which section was in force at the time of deceased's death, but has since been repealed. It is set out in the reasons for judgment in this Court now reported. By a previous judgment of this Court in the same action[3] a new trial was ordered. The new trial took place before Richards J., who held that the plaintiff was entitled to judgment[4]. His judgment was reversed by the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division[5], which (Harrison J. dissenting) dismissed the action. It is from the latter judgment that the present appeal was taken. The appeal to this Court was allowed and the judgment of the trial judge restored, with costs throughout; Crocket J. dissenting.\nO. M. Biggar K.C. and J. F. H. Teed K.C. for the appellant.\nT. N. Phelan K.C. and J. E. Friel for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the Court (The Chief Justice and Kerwin, Hudson and Taschereau JJ.) was delivered by\nKerwin J.\u2014Pursuant to the judgment of this Court[6], a new trial was had between the parties before Mr. Justice Richards without the intervention of a jury. The plaintiff succeeded in her claim[7] but the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick (Mr. Justice Harrison dissenting) set aside the judgment and dismissed the action[8]. The plaintiff again appeals.\nBy the policy issued by the respondent, the deceased was insured against bodily injuries, effected directly and independently of all other causes, through external, violent and accidental means, and\nif any one of the disabilities enumerated below shall result from such injuries alone within, ninety days from the date of accident, the Company will pay the sum specified opposite such disability.\nUnder the schedule of indemnities for loss of life, ten thousand dollars was payable in a certain manner.\nIt was conceded that the appellant could not succeed under the terms of the policy alone, but she relies on section 5 of the New Brunswick Accident Insurance Act, which was in force at all relevant times and which reads as follows:\u2014 5. In every contract of accident insurance, the event insured against shall include any bodily injury occasioned by external force or agency, and happening without the direct intent of the person injured, or as the indirect result of his intentional act, and no term, condition, stipulation, warranty or proviso of the contract, varying the obligation or liability of the insurer shall, as against the insured, have any force or validity, but the contract may provide for the exclusion from the risks insured against of accidents arising from any hazard or class of hazard expressly stated in the policy.\nWithout detailing the evidence, I am satisfied that the deceased suffered a bodily injury occasioned by external agency and that the injury, which was the event insured against, happened without his direct intent. He suffered from diabetes and it was his custom to take eight units of insulin morning and afternoon. There can be really no dispute that on the morning in question he took insulin, and while there is no direct evidence as to the quantity, the proper inference is that he took the usual dose. This finding, coupled with the testimony that he suffered an insulin reaction, means that while he intentionally took the eight units, the bodily injury occasioned thereby happened without his intending it.\nWhat was the proximate cause of death? It is true that the deceased's diabetic condition co-acted with the insulin but, while they were both ingredients, there was, on the true construction of the policy and section, only one cause of death. Fidelity and Casualty Company of New York v. Mitchell[9]. That was the bodily injury sustained as a result of the taking of the insulin.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the judgment at the trial restored. The appellant is entitled to her costs of the appeals to the Appeal Division and to this Court.\nCrocket J. (dissenting)\u2014This action, which was brought by the appellant as the beneficiary under a policy of accident insurance to recover the indemnity provided for thereby for the death of her husband through alleged accidental injury, was originally tried before Barry, Chief Justice of the King's Bench Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, and a jury.\nThe statement of claim, as originally framed, alleged that the insured, prior to March 1st, 1933, received bodily injuries effected directly and independently of all other causes, through external, violent and accidental means, within the meaning of the said policy of insurance, in that he \"accidentally and by mistake took a dose of insulin, as a result whereof and not otherwise [he] came to his death,\" on March 1st, 1933. During the trial the words \"an over-dose of insulin\" were substituted for the words \"a dose of insulin\", and the Chief Justice left two principal questions to the jury directed to that particular issue, viz.: \"Did the insured accidentally, and by mistake, take an over-dose of insulin?\" and, \"Was the insured's death caused solely by taking, accidentally and by mistake, an over-dose of insulin?\" To the first of these questions the jury answered \"Yes,\" and to the second \"Yes, indirectly.\" Notwithstanding these two answers and further findings by the jury, in answer to other questions, that the insured's death was caused or contributed to by diabetes indirectly through insulin reaction, His Lordship, upon consideration of a motion for the entry of judgment, dismissed the action on the ground that there was no evidence whatever to justify the finding that the insured accidentally and by mistake took an over-dose of insulin, and that the answer to the second question should have been \"No\" instead of \"Yes, indirectly.\"\nThe plaintiff appealed from that judgment to the Appeal Division, with the result that the trial judgment was sustained by Baxter C.J., and Grimmer J.; Harrison J. dissenting[10].\nThe appellant then appealed to this Court from that decision, with the result that a new trial of the action, except on the incidental issues of non-disclosure and of age, was ordered in March, 1938[11]. The second trial came on before Richards J., sitting without a jury, in December, 1938. That learned judge, putting to himself the same question which Chief Justice Barry had put to the jury on the former trial, viz.: \"Did Dr. Price take an over-dose of insulin accidentally and by mistake?\", found that there was only one possible answer to be made thereto, which was \"No,\" and that the only logical finding is that Dr. Price took the normal quantity of eight units intentionally. Later, in addressing himself to the question as to whether the death of Dr. Price was an accident within the terms of the policy itself, His Lordship said:\nThere was no mistake about the taking of the insulin, there was no overdose, there was no accident within the ordinary meaning of the term. It seems unnecessary to discuss this feature further.\nHe decided however that the appellant was entitled to recover for the indemnity provided by the policy on the ground that the case was one which fell under the express terms of s. 5 of the New Brunswick Accident Insurance Act, c. 85, R.S.N.B., 1927, as he construed it. That section, though it has since been repealed, was in force at the time of the insured's death. It read:\u2014\nIn every contract of accident insurance, the event insured against shall include any bodily injury occasioned by external force or agency, and happening without the direct intent of the person injured, or as the indirect result of his intentional act, and no term, condition, stipulation, warranty or proviso of the contract, varying the obligation or liability of the insurer shall, as against the insured, have any force or validity, but the contract may provide for the exclusion from the risks insured against of accidents arising from any hazard or class of hazard expressly stated in the policy.\nHis Lordship said that it seemed abundantly clear to him that the section was intended to provide and did provide for cases where the external force or agency is intentional and something unexpected happens as a result\u2014either (a) without the direct intention of the person injured, or (b) as the indirect result of his intentional act, and held that the first alternative (a) exactly applied to the present case. In support of this view he quoted a dictum of Chief Justice Rose of Ontario, which, he pointed out, was obiter, in Battle v. Fidelity & Casualty Company of New York[12], and dicta of Riddell and Middleton JJ. A., of the Ontario Court of Appeal, in Lang Shirt Co.'s Trustee v. London Life Ins, Co.[13], as well as dicta from the majority judgment of this Court, written by Mignault J., on appeal in that case[14], dealing with an identical Ontario enactment. From this judgment the present respondent appealed to the Appeal Division, where the appeal was allowed and the action dismissed per Baxter C.J. and Grimmer J.; Harrison J. dissenting, so that the case comes to us now a second time by way of appeal on the part of the plaintiff.\nThe majority judgment suggested, as the Appeal Division had done on the plaintiff's first appeal, that the object of s. 5 of the New Brunswick Accident Insurance Act was to prevent advantage being taken of exceptions in policies like those considered in Cole v. Accident Ins. Co.[15], and in United London & Scottish Ins. Co.; In re Brown's Claim[16], and held that it did not define the term \"accident,\" as suggested by Rose J. and Middleton J.A., in the dicta quoted by the trial judge, but simply declared that the \"event insured against,\" which must necessarily be the result of an accident, shall include certain things. It quotes s. 2 (a) of the Act, which declares that in that chapter \"accident insurance\" means \"insurance against loss arising from accident to the person of the insured,\" points out that the policy insured the deceased against \"bodily injuries, effected directly and independently of all other causes, through external, violent and accidental means,\" and takes the ground that the whole subject falls within s. 2 (a). The learned Chief Justice quotes the dictum of Lord Adam of the Scottish Court of Sessions in Clidero v. Scottish Accident Ins. Co.[17] that:\nA person may do certain acts, the result of which acts may produce unforeseen cons\u00e9quences, and may produce what is commonly called accidental death, but the means are exactly what the man intended to use, and did use, and was prepared to use. The means were not accidental, but the result might be accidental.\nHe also quotes a passage from the judgment of Bray J., in Scarr v. General Accident Assce. Corpn.[18], to the same effect: that the fact of an intentional physical act producing an unforeseen or unexpected result does not render the act, which induces the result, accidental; and also the dictum of Lord Lindley in the well known Workmen's Compensation case of Fenton v. Thorley[19], that in an action on a policy the causa proxima is alone considered in ascertaining the cause of loss. He says that it was to ascertain the causa proxima that the case had been sent back for a new trial, and held that the intentional insertion of the hypodermic needle could not be considered the proximate cause of the insured's death within the meaning of the section. That enactment only declared what \"bodily injuries\" shall include, and in his opinion was \"directed to the result of an accident; not to the accident itself.\"\nHarrison J. in his dissenting judgment said that the clear implication of the judgment of this Court in the former appeal was that, if the taking of insulin on the morning in question was the proximate cause of the death of the insured, the plaintiff was entitled to succeed in her claim upon the accident policy under the provisions of the New Brunswick Accident Insurance Act or that otherwise the action would have been dismissed in accordance with the judgment of the dissenting judge; and that death by insulin shock due to the taking of a dose of insulin could be an accident within the meaning of the Accident Insurance Act and there was sufficient evidence of such an accident if death was in fact caused by the taking of insulin and that the question was, therefore, res judicata. With all respect, I think the judgment of this Court carried no such implication as the learned judge sugggests.\nMr. Justice Davis, who delivered the majority judgment, said that the real question in issue, broadly speaking, was whether or not the insured's death was caused by accident, and that the basis of the claim under the policy was that his death was caused by his having taken insulin for his diabetic condition on the morning in question in too large a dose. \"There is no direct evidence,\" he continued,\nthat he took any insulin the morning in question, but it is a fair inference, and really not in dispute, that he had taken insulin that morning, as he had been accustomed to do for several months each morning and each evening. Whether on the particular occasion the quantity he took was in excess of the quantity that had been prescribed for him and which he had been taking regularly for some months or whether he took the usual quantity that morning but it was too much for his system at that particular time is not made plain because, of course, no one knows the exact amount he did take.\nThen he went on to discuss s. 5 of the New Brunswick Accident Insurance Act. He said the section was obviously intended to put an end to defences by accident insurance companies which had raised technical and confusing issues, and the statute, therefore, created liability in the companies whether the event insured against (i.e., the accident) happened \"without the direct intent of the person injured\" or \"as the indirect result of his intentional act.\" In applying the section to the circumstances of this case the essential point is that in law the external force or agency which occasions the bodily injury must be the proximate cause of the death.\nAfter a lengthy quotation from the judgment of Scrutton J., as he then was, in Coxe v. Employers' Liability Assce. Corpn. Ltd.[20], which turned on the construction of a condition in an insurance policy excepting death \"directly or indirectly caused by, arising from, or traceable to * * * war,\" and in which it was held that it was impossible to reconcile the last italicized words with the maxim causa proxima non remota spectatur, which must be applied to all policies of insurance, whether marine or accident, unless it be excluded by express words or necessary implication, Davis J. said:\nIn the section of the statute which governs the case before us, the words are \"any bodily injury occasioned by external force or agency\"\u2014not, occasioned \"directly or indirectly\" by external force or agency. That being so, upon the proper construction of the section the external force or agency must be the proximate cause of the bodily injury.\nThen, having pointed out so clearly the basis of the action, viz., the taking of an over-dose of insulin, and that the question whether he had taken an overdose or had taken the prescribed and normal dose but which was too much for his system at that particular time, had not been made plain, and construed the critical section of the Accident Insurance Act in the language I have reproduced, he immediately proceeded to consider the effect of the jury's answers to the questions submitted by Barry C.J.\nAs to this feature of the case, he said in introducing the subject that \"the real question for the jury was whether or not the taking of the insulin on the morning in question directly resulted in the death of the insured,\" and added that \"their answers present a good deal of difficulty to us in ascertaining what their conclusion really was on the vital fact whether or not the insulin was the proximate cause of death.\" He then set out the answers to questions 1, 2, 8 and 11, and added these words: \"It is plain that the jury have not determined the vital issue as to whether or not the taking of the insulin on the morning in question was the proximate cause of death,\" and for that reason held that the case would have to go back for a new trial. It is these three last quoted statements of the judgment, and the fact that the Court ordered a new trial as stated, which have been seized on by the appellant's counsel to support the proposition that the judgment on the former appeal necessarily means that if a diabetic patient, who has for months been regularly taking insulin in the quantity prescribed for him, dies as the direct result of his voluntary and intentional injection into his own body of any insulin\u2014whether it be an over-dose taken accidentally and by mistake or not\u2014and such a patient has an accident insurance policy on his life, the beneficiary named therein is entitled to recover for his death as having been solely occasioned by external force or agency under the provisions of the New Brunswick Accident Insurance Act in force at the time of the death of the insured.\nI should have thought that the words \"the taking of the insulin\" themselves manifestly imply a reference to the taking of an over-dose of insulin accidentally and by mistake, as alleged by the plaintiff in her statement of claim, and as specifically found by the jury in answer to the first and fundamental question, which the Court was considering, and which the judgment had previously so clearly pointed out was the sole basis of the plaintiff's claim in the action. Otherwise we should have to regard this portion of the Court's judgment as a direct and immediate disaffirmance of what the Court had just laid down as to the proper construction of s. 5 of the Accident Insurance Act.\nSo far as my own judgment in the former appeal is concerned, I may say that before writing it I had the advantage of reading and carefully considering a copy of my brother Davis's proposed judgment. I stated in my judgment, as may be seen at pages 242 and 243 of the official reports, that I agreed with him that the section did not exclude the maxim causa proxima and that it followed that there could be no recovery under any contract of accident insurance, whether for a bodily injury or for death resulting directly from a bodily injury, unless such bodily injury was directly caused by external force or agency, or, in other words, unless external force or agency was the proximate cause of such bodily injury. That, as I said, was precisely the construction which the learned Chief Justice of New Brunswick and Grimmer J. placed on the section in their majority judgment, and upon which their decision affirming the dismissal of the action by the trial judge was manifestly based.\nSo far, then, as the effect of s. 5 of the New Brunswick Accident Insurance Act is concerned, as it applies to this case, it is clear that this Court on the former appeal definitely laid it down that upon the proper construction of that enactment the external force or agency, which occasions the bodily injury, must be the proximate cause of the insured's death. That surely cannot mean that the section may be interpreted as providing that the essential external force or agency may be merely a contributory cause or one of several causes, whose combined operation brought about the insured's death. Obviously it can only mean that the injection of the insulin by means of the hypodermic needle in the hand of the insured himself, which is the only thing that could conceivably be described as \"external force or agency,\" must be the sole and exclusive cause of the death, or, in other words, that the death must have occurred as the direct and natural consequence of the alleged external force or agency without the intervention of any other cause. Indeed, as already pointed out, that was the entire basis of the appellant's claim, as alleged in para. 8 of her statement of claim, viz., if I may repeat: that the insured \"received bodily injuries effected directly and independently of all other causes, through external, violent and accidental means * * * in that he \"accidentally and by mistake took an overdose of insulin [substituted for \"a dose of insulin\"], as a result whereof and not otherwise\" he came to his death. This was the fundamental issue on which the case was first tried, when everybody clearly took it for granted that; under the policy and the New Brunswick Accident Insurance Act alike the \"external force or agency\" or \"means\"\u2014as both the policy and the statement of claim express it\u2014must be at least \"accidental,\" as well as external. Richards J., on the second trial, however, in view of the explicit findings he had made on that basic issue, distinctly held that the death of the insured was not an accident within the terms of the policy alone, but was an accident within the terms of s. 5 of the Accident Insurance Act. Founding himself upon the dicta in the Lang (1), Battle (2), and other cases, to which he referred, His Lordship suggested that that section of the statute was intended to include as accidents circumstances where the means is not accidental but intentional and an unintentional result follows. While, no doubt, some of these dicta appear to strongly support the view of the learned trial judge, I am of opinion, with the greatest possible respect, that the clear effect of the unanimous judgment of this Court on the appellant's first appeal, upon that question, is quite to the contrary; and that the section cannot now be regarded as doing away with the fundamental and universally recognized principle of accident insurance, viz.: that the accident must be found in \"the means,\" or, as the section itself expresses it, in the \"external force or agency,\" from which the bodily injury insured against has naturally and directly resulted.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed, and with costs, if asked.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: E.

Pigott and Pigott Construction Company Limited (Plaintiffs) Respondents.\n1941: March 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12; 1941: October 7.\nPresent: Duff C.J. and Rinfret, Crocket, Kerwin and Taschereau JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nContract\u2014Rescission\u2014Alleged fraudulent misrepresentations in a selling circular inducing purchase of shares in company\u2014Construction of representations\u2014Right to rescission of contract of purchase\u2014Principles applicable\u2014Status to sue\u2014Shares bought and held by purchaser for benefit of a company which later surrendered its charter after assigning its assets to a successor company\u2014Limitation of actions\u2014Time from which statute of limitation begins to run.\nThis Court dismissed the defendant\u2019s appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, [1939] O.R. 66, dismissing its appeal from the judgment of Greene J., [1937] O.R. 888, rescinding a contract for purchase from the defendant of shares of stock in a company on the ground that the purchase was induced by false and fraudulent representations in a prospectus or selling circular issued by the defendant.\nPer Rinfret, Crocket and Taschereau JJ.: The mere fact that statements in a prospectus issued by a defendant are false does not necessarily render him liable in damages; the false representation has to be made knowingly, or without belief in its truth, or with reckless disregard of whether it is true or false. If the defendant was indifferent as to whether the statements were false or true, this frame of mind is sufficient, when the facts are proven to be false, to create civil liability (Derry v. Peek, 14 App. Cas. 337).\nThe shares in question had been purchased by P. who purchased and held them as trustee for P.-H. Co., the beneficial owner. That company later surrendered its charter, after having assigned its assets to its successor, P. Co., which therefore became the beneficial owner of the shares, P. holding them as trustee for it. The plaintiffs in the action were P. and P. Co. Held: The action was maintainable. Per Rinfret, Crocket and Taschereau JJ. (agreeing with Masten and Fisher JJ.A. in the Court of Appeal): (1) P. had by himself a status to maintain the action; P. Co., though not a necessary party, was yet a proper party plaintiff. (2) The rule that a right incidental and subsidiary to the ownership of property is assignable and does not savour of champerty or maintenance, applies to the facts of this case. Per Kerwin J.: The contract was made between defendant and P., and the right of action for rescission vested in P. as trustee and there it remains.\nA contention that the action was barred by The Limitations Act, Ont., over six years having elapsed between the purchase of the shares and the commencement of the action, was rejected. The judgment of Masten and Fisher JJ.A. in the Court of Appeal, refusing to interfere with the trial judge\u2019s findings that plaintiffs had not been guilty of laches and did not suspect any fraud until a time much less than six years before commencement of the action, and holding that the statute began to run only at that time, was (per Rinfret, Crocket and Taschereau JJ.) approved.\nAPPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] dismissing (Henderson J.A. dissenting) the defendant\u2019s appeal from the judgment of the trial judge, Greene J.[2], holding that the plaintiffs were entitled to rescission of a certain contract for purchase of shares of stock in the Montreal Island Power Company and to repayment of the purchase price with interest, upon the plaintiffs returning to the defendant the shares. With respect to said shares, the formal judgment at trial declared that the plaintiff Joseph M. Pigott was induced to purchase them by means of false and fraudulent representations in a prospectus or selling circular issued by the defendant, and that the contract for the purchase was not binding upon the plaintiffs; and rescinded and set aside the said contract; and provided for delivery by the plaintiffs of the share certificates, recovery against the defendant of the price paid for the shares and interest, and delivery to the defendant of the share certificates upon payment of the sum recovered against the defendant and costs.\nBesides the disputes with regard to the alleged misrepresentations, certain other questions were raised.\nThe shares had been purchased by the plaintiff Joseph M. Pigott, and were purchased and held by him as trustee for the beneficial owner, Pigott-Healy Construction Co. Ltd. (the name of which was later changed). That company later surrendered its charter, after having assigned all its assets to its successor, Pigott Construction Co. Ltd., which therefore became the beneficial owner of the shares, Mr. Pigott holding them as trustee for it. The latter company was made a co-plaintiff in the action. The defendant contended that the plaintiffs had no right to maintain the action.\nDealing with this question in the Court of Appeal, Masten and Fisher JJ.A., with whose reasons on this question Rinfret, Crocket and Taschereau JJ. in this Court agreed, said\nHere, the contract for purchase of these shares was between the appellants and Pigott as an individual, and the misrepresentations complained of were made to him. The shares were transferred to him and he became and has remained at all times a shareholder of the Power Company. As the contract was his, and the representations were made to him, he has the right to claim personally its rescission for such a right is incidental to his personal contract with appellants, and the fact that third parties are entitled to look to Pigott as a trustee for them cannot affect, much less annul, his right to claim rescission. Indeed, as a trustee, that was his duty. As between the successive cestui que trustent the transfer of interest from one to the other cannot operate to annul and defeat Pigott\u2019s right of action. The appellant contracted with Pigott personally and cannot set up in his defence the outstanding rights of third parties for whom Pigott is trustee.\nand, after referring to certain cases and authorities, they concluded:\n(1) That Pigott had by himself a status to maintain this action, and that the Pigott Construction Company, Limited, though not a necessary party, is yet a proper party plaintiff.\n(2) That the rule that a right incidental and subsidiary to the ownership of property is assignable and does not savour of champerty or maintenance applies to the facts of this case.\nThe defendant claimed that the plaintiffs\u2019 alleged cause of action was barred by The Limitations Act (R.S.O., 1927, c. 106, s. 48). The purchase of the shares in question was made in 1927 and the action was commenced in 1935. On this question the trial judge said:\n* * * The plaintiffs made no enquiries until 1932 and according to the evidence of Mr. Pigott did not suspect any fraud until Mr. Acres, an engineer employed by the plaintiffs, made his report late in 1934. In my opinion, the statute began to run then. It was argued for the defendant that there must be concealment by the defendant to prevent the statute running, but Bulli Coal Mining Company v. Osborne[3] is authority for the statement that so long as there has been no laches by the party defrauded, it is immaterial whether or not there have been on the part of the wrongdoer active measures to prevent detection. See also Kerr on Fraud and Mistake, 6th ed. at p. 447, and at pp. 16 and 17.\nThe plaintiffs were not guilty of laches. Dividends were not expected on the preference shares for a few years, so that the plaintiff in commencing his definite enquiries in 1932 acted with reasonable promptness.\nIn the Court of Appeal, Masten and Fisher JJ.A., with whose reasons on this question Rinfret, Crocket and Taschereau JJ. in this Court agreed, said:\nWe have carefully read and considered all the cases that are referred to by counsel on either side, and it seems to us that they are completely and accurately summarized in the 9th edition of Salmond on Torts, at page 180, in the following words:\u2014\n\u201cWhen the defendant has been guilty of fraud or other wilful wrongdoing, the period of limitation does not begin to run until the existence of a cause of action has become known to the plaintiff. This is commonly spoken of as the rule of concealed fraud, but the term fraud is here used in its widest sense as meaning any act of wilful and conscious wrongdoing\u2014for example, a wilful underground trespass and abstraction of minerals. The term concealed, moreover, does not imply any active suppression of the facts by the defendant, but means merely that the wrong is unknown to the person injured at the time of its commission.\u201d\nWhether the circumstances imposed a duty on the plaintiffs of making an earlier investigation, and whether they were thus guilty of laches is a question of fact upon which the trial Judge gives effect to the evidence of Mr. Pigott that he did not suspect any fraud until late in 1934. The fact that no dividends were to be expected on this stock for some years after its purchase, lends support to this finding of fact by the trial Judge; and for the reasons which have appeared earlier in this judgment we think that this Court ought not to interfere with the finding of fact of the trial Judge.\nW.N. Tilley K.C. and B.V. McCrimmon for the appellant.\nGlyn Osler K.C. and H.A.F. Boyde K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2014I agree that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Rinfret, Crocket and Taschereau JJ. was delivered by\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014The claim of the respondents is based on alleged misrepresentations made to them by the appellant and which induced them to purchase a number of 6% preference shares of an issue of $1,000,000 of the Montreal Island Power Company (dividends to be cumulative from January 1st, 1928).\nThe circular which was issued by the appellant on the 15th of June, 1927, contained, inter alia, the following statements which are the target for the attacks of the respondents, and which are qualified as being misleading, untrue and false representations:\u2014\nBUSINESS AND PROPERTY: The Montreal Island Power Company, incorporated under the laws of the Province of Quebec, has been formed for the purpose of developing a water power located on the Rivi\u00e8re des Prairies (Back River) about seven miles from the heart of the city of Montreal, Que. It is estimated that this site, under a head of 26 feet, is capable of developing 65,000 h.p. twenty-four hour power. Construction will start immediately and will be so carried out that 40,000 h.p. should be available for delivery by the end of 1929, provision being made for increasing the capacity to 65,000 h.p. at minimum cost, as required.\nPOWER MARKET: The Company has entered into a contract with the Montreal Light, Heat & Power Consolidated, whereby that Company will purchase all the power from this development for a period of thirty years, with provision for extension of the contract for a further like period. The power will be taken in specified annual instalments, until the entire capacity is absorbed.\nMontreal Light, Heat & Power Consolidated operates one of the largest public utility systems in Canada. Directly, through subsidiaries or associated Companies, it does all the gas business and practically all the electric power and lighting distribution for domestic, industrial, municipal and tramway purposes in Greater Montreal, serving a rapidly growing community with a present population in excess of 1,000,000. The growth and strength of the contracting company are indicated by its net revenue, which has been as follows:\u2014\n1922\u2014$6,483,473. 1924-$7,670,190. 1926\u2014$8,693,688. The average annual increase in demand for power for the past five years amounted to 16,000 h.p. At the same rate of increase the entire capacity of Montreal Island Power Company would be utilized and sold within four years.\nEARNINGS: Under the above mentioned contract at ultimate capacity, it is estimated that net earnings of the Company will amount to approximately $900,000 per annum, or over seven and one-half times dividend requirements after payment of bond interest.\nENGINEERING AND CONSTRUCTION: Under arrangements agreed upon the technical work and supervision of construction of this development will be carried out by the Engineers of Power Corporation of Canada Limited.\nThis development has been favourably reported upon by the Engineers of Power Corporation of Canada Limited, and by Messrs. J.M. Robertson, R.S. and W.S. Lea and T. Pringle & Son Limited.\nThe plaintiffs allege that on the strength of these representations they purchased, on the 22nd day of June, 1927, 100 preferred shares of this issue and 40 shares of common stock at the aggregate price of $9,800, and on the 27th of April, 1929, 50 additional common shares at the price of $2,000. They claim rescission of these contracts and the return to the plaintiffs of the sum of $11,800 with interest.\nTheir contention is that the alleged misrepresentations were false and untrue and related to (1) the estimated output of power; (2) the contract under which the power was sold; (3) the estimated future increase in power demand; (4) the estimated net earnings, and (5) the reports made by the engineers. The trial Judge maintained partially the action, ordered the defendant to pay $9,800, but dismissed the claim for rescission of the contract for the purchase of 50 shares made on the 27th of April, 1929. The Court of Appeal (Mr. Justice Henderson dissenting) affirmed this judgment.\nThere is no doubt, as it has been pointed out by the learned counsel for the appellant, that whether or not there were fraudulent misrepresentations on the part of the appellant, must be determined not by the examination of subsequent evidence, but by an examination of circumstances at the time the circular was issued. It is also settled law that the appellant may be found liable only if the statements of which the respondents complain were false and were made knowing them to be false, or with reckless disregard as to whether they were true or false. It is what the appellant thought the result of the enterprise would be that must be considered, and not what it turned out to be.\nAfter a careful study of the various reports prepared by very reputable firms of engineers, I have come to the conclusion that they do not justify the appellant to say in its circular letter that \u201cit is estimated that this site, under a head of 26 feet, is capable of developing 65,000 h.p. 24 hour power.\u201d\nIn 1922, Pringle & Son Limited estimated an output of 45,000 h.p. In 1923, J.M. Robertson, of Montreal, reached identical conclusions, and in 1924, R.S. and W.S. Lea said in their report:\u2014\nWe believe 20,000 c.f.s. or more a fair estimate for the average year, but not likely to be maintained every year, assuming of course that past records are correct.\nThey also expressed the view that in a few years, the flow would be over 20,000 c.f.s. and eventually nearer 30,000 than 20,000 c.f.s., but this possibility, however, was on the basis of further storage developments. The highest headrace figured by R.S. and W.S. Lea is 56 feet, giving a maximum head of 26 feet, with therefore an output of approximately 50,000 h.p., but this is assuming that the head would always be 26 feet, which under the conditions prevailing at Des Prairies River is an impossibility. R.S. and W.S. Lea also warned that they were not sufficiently familiar with ice conditions to offer an opinion on the head which would be available during the winter months.\nIn September, 1926, a further report was obtained from the Power Corporation of Canada, Limited, and the engineers of that Company came to the conclusion that at the date on which the report was written, 20,000 c.f.s. may be accepted as a dependable flow for commercial purposes. They add that storage works are under construction in the water shed tributary to the Back River, and that they are expected to raise the dependable flow to 23,000 c.f.s. before the proposed development could reasonably be in operation. It is their opinion that a normal gross head of 26\u00bd feet will be available but they add that during certain seasons it may be reduced to 18 feet. If we use the formula adopted, and multiply the head by the flow and divide by 10.23, it will be seen that 23,000 c.f.s. with a head of 26\u00bd feet will give approximately 59,000 h.p., but this is assuming that the head is always 26\u00bd feet and that it will never be reduced to 18 feet as pointed out in the report of the engineers. As to power available, the Power Corporation state that they provide for machinery installation to deliver 65,000 h.p. continuously, but they do not say that the development is capable of an output of 65,000 h.p. This ultimate output is based on contingencies which may never happen. None of these engineers venture to state that the proposed development is capable of furnishing 65,000 h.p. 24 hour power and I fail to see how their reports can be interpreted as having such a meaning.\nWhen heard as a witness, Mr. Wurtele of the Power Corporation, who had prepared the report for this Company, repeated that the dependable flow would be raised to 23,000 c.f.s. at the time the plant is ready for operation, and that, within ten or fifteen years it might be ultimately up to 27,000 c.f.s. if storage facilities not yet decided upon, but the result of his self-made studies were available. It is only in the event of the happening of these contingencies that a firm power of 65,000 h.p. would be the output of the plant. This corroborates his report, and in the meantime for ten or fifteen years, the power developed would be approximately 59,000 h.p. non-continuous power, on account of the frequent head reduction to 18 feet. This is far from the promised 65,000 h.p. twenty-four hour power, and at $19 per h.p., it makes a substantial difference in returns available for dividends.\nIt has been argued on behalf of the appellant that the elevation of the headrace has been determined in the three earlier reports without any definite knowledge as to what level the municipal authorities would permit, having regard to sewers discharging into the river. This point, they say, was apparently cleared up in 1926 when the Power Corporation in its report of September 28th of that year fixed the headrace level at 56.5 which was higher than the headrace level taken in any of the earlier reports. It is true that the reports prepared by Pringle, Robertson and Lea give a lower head on account of a lower headrace, but even with a higher headrace the output of power would not have been 65,000 h.p. twenty-four hour power. And the best evidence of this, is that with a headrace of 56\u00bd feet the engineers of the Power Corporation do not foresee with the actual flow a 65,000 h.p. twenty\u2011four hour power. It seems that this 65,000 h.p. continuous power is not available because the flow of the river is not sufficient.\nAnother of the appellant\u2019s contentions is that the Board of the Montreal Island, after the construction of the plant, was under the control of the Montreal Light, Heat, and that this Company which had purchased 125,000 h.p. from the Beauharnois, refused to permit the installation of additional units, which would have given additional power. This has been dealt with by the learned trial Judge, and the Court of Appeal, who came to the conclusion that if no additional units were installed, it is because there was not a sufficient dependable flow to justify such units, and no convincing reasons have been submitted to us why this finding should be set aside.\nThe circular further states that the construction is to start immediately and that 40,000 h.p. should be available for delivery by the end of 1929, and that the Montreal Light, Heat & Power Consolidated Company will purchase all the power from this development for a period of 30 years with provision for extension of the contract for a further like period. The power is to be taken in specified annual instalments until the entire capacity is absorbed. The facts are that the contract with the Montreal Light, Heat & Power provides for the purchase of 60,000 h.p., an initial block of 20,000 h.p. to be delivered by October 15th, 1930, and then a block of 10,000 h.p. annually during the four succeeding years. This means that by October, 1930, under the contract the Montreal Light, Heat & Power is to take delivery of only 20,000 h.p. and not 40,000 h.p. by the end of 1929 as stated in the prospectus. The Montreal Light, Heat & Power was not bound to take delivery and pay for 40,000 h.p. before the 15th of October, 1932. It is true that the Montreal Light, Heat & Power advanced its purchases one year, taking 20,000 h.p. on October 15th, 1929, but it is still false that by the end of 1929, 40,000 h.p. were available for delivery, and a revenue from 40,000 h.p. was not paid to the Montreal Island Company until two years after the time mentioned in the prospectus.\nAs to the estimated future increase in power demand and which is referred to as follows in the circular letter: The average annual increase in demand for power for the past five years amounted to 16,000 h.p. At the same rate of increase the entire capacity of Montreal Island Power Company would be utilized and sold within four years.\nI believe that the statement is misleading. It conveys the idea that within four years, that is in 1933, the plant would have an output of 65,000 h.p. all sold to the Montreal Light, Heat & Power Company, when the truth is that under the terms of the contract it was only in October, 1934, that the last 10,000 h.p. should be delivered to the purchasing Company, and making a total of 60,000 h.p.\nIn view of what I have said in reference to the total capacity of the development, it follows that the statement as to the net earnings of the Montreal Island Company estimated in the prospectus at \u201c$900,000 per annum, or over seven and one-half times dividend requirements after payment of bond interest,\u201d is not according to facts, and cannot by any stretch of the imagination be termed as a true picture of the situation.\nThe last paragraph of the circular letter reads as follows:\u2014\nThis development has been favourably reported upon by the Engineers of Power Corporation of Canada Limited, and by Messrs. J.M. Robertson, R.S. and W.S. Lea and T. Pringle & Son Limited.\nI cannot agree with the suggestion of the learned counsel for the appellant as to the interpretation that should be given to this statement. The true meaning of this paragraph, and the only way it could have been read by a prospective purchaser, is obviously that all these competent and very widely known engineers had given their approval to this development. It conveys the idea that they all concurred in the statement \u201cthat under a head of 26 feet it was capable of developing 65,000 h.p. 24 hour power.\u201d In fact, none of the reports of these engineers substantiate this statement, and the inaccuracy of this representation certainly must have had a bearing in the minds of the investors, and developed an optimism which the disclosure of the real facts would surely not have justified.\nOn the whole, I come to the conclusion that the judgment of the courts below should not be disturbed, and I am satisfied that if the respondents had been furnished with the real facts, they would not have invested their money in this development, the possibilities of which have been unduly magnified.\nAs I have said already, the mere fact that statements in a prospectus are false does not necessarily render the defendant liable in damages. The false representation has to be made knowingly, or without belief in its truth, or with reckless disregard of whether it is true or false. It seems to me that the draftsman of this circular letter was at least indifferent as to whether the statements were false or true. And this frame of mind is sufficient, when the facts are proven to be false, to create civil liability. (Derry v. Peek[4]).\nAs to the technical objection raised by the appellant in respect of the plaintiffs\u2019 right to sue, and the defence raised on the statute of limitation, I agree with what has been said by Masten and Fisher JJ.A. of the Court of Appeal for Ontario.\nI would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nKERWIN J.\u2014Having read the evidence in the light of the various submissions made by counsel for the appellant, I am satisfied that I would have arrived at the same conclusion as the trial judge. As to the right of the plaintiffs, or either of them, to sue,\u2014the contract was made between the defendants and Joseph M. Pigott, and even though he had been a trustee for a corporation since dissolved and is now trustee for his co-plaintiff, the right of action for rescission vested in him as trustee and there it remains. The appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Tilley, Thomson & Parmenter.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Bruce & Boyde.\n[1] [1939] O.R. 66; [1938] 4 D.L.R. 593.\n[2] [1937] O.R. 888; [1937] 4 D.L.R. 598.\n[3] [1899] A.C. 351.\n[4] (1889) 14 App. Cas. 337.\n",

Frind, [1941] S.C.R. 531\nDate: 1941-10-07\nRoss Sheppard (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nMax Arno Frind (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1941: May 26; 1941: October 7.\nPresent: Duff C.J. and Rinfret, Davis, Hudson and Taschereau JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nMaintenance\u2014Suit for damages for alleged intermeddling and stirring up litigation\u2014Requisites for recovery\u2014Absence of proof of special damage.\nRespondent sued to recover damages against appellant for maliciously instigating and stirring up respondent\u2019s wife to commence and prosecute an action for alimony. Appellant had had nothing to do with the alimony action itself, but had merely put into the wife\u2019s head the idea of bringing it. During the course of the trial of the alimony action, respondent entered into a settlement by which he agreed to pay his wife $500 per annum for life and to deposit securities as security for payment and to pay her costs; and judgment was given declaring the settlement binding.\nHeld (reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, [1940] O.R. 448, and restoring the judgment of Roach J., [1940] O.R. 292): Respondent\u2019s claim against appellant should be dismissed.\nPer the Chief Justice: In the circumstances of the case, the action could only succeed on proof of the absence of reasonable and probable cause for the alimony action. Also special damage was not proved. On both these grounds respondent\u2019s claim should be dismissed.\nPer Rinfret, Davis and Hudson JJ.: In the case of civil proceedings, while there cannot be \u201cmaintenance\u201d in the strict sense of the term until the action is commenced, a person who, without reasonable and probable cause, instigates another to bring an action incurs a civil liability to the defendant similar to that incurred by a maintainer. But the action against the instigator is only maintainable in respect of legal damage actually sustained. In the present action it cannot be said that the settlement in the alimony action was not the recognition by respondent of a legal obligation on him towards his wife or that appellant, who stirred up the litigation, was the cause of respondent having to make the payments under the judgment. At least it can scarcely be said that the wife had no right to bring that action.\nPer Taschereau J.: Appellant intermeddled and stirred up litigation; but no special damage to respondent had been proved; and without proof of special damage a civil action for damages by reason of said facts cannot succeed. Such an action at common law is not one for the invasion of a right; it is one in respect of an offence which causes damage to the plaintiff. The annual payments ordered in the alimony action were clearly the discharge of a legal obligation; and they do not, nor do the costs adjudged against respondent (or incurred by him) in that action, constitute special damages for which the present action can be maintained. APPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] which (reversing, on the question now in issue, the judgment of Roach J. [2]) gave judgment to the plaintiff against the defendant for damages in the sum of $4,000 upon the plaintiff\u2019s claim that the defendant had \u201cby officious intermeddling, improperly and maliciously, and for the purpose of stirring up litigation and strife and without having any interest in the suit, instigated, stirred up, encouraged and advised\u201d the plaintiff\u2019s wife \u201cto commence and prosecute an action\u201d against him for alimony and other claims. The material facts with regard to the question in issue in this appeal are sufficiently stated in the reasons for judgment in this Court now reported. The appeal to this Court was allowed and the judgment of the trial Judge restored. No costs were awarded of the appeal to this Court or to the Court of Appeal.\nT.N. Phelan K.C. for the appellant.\nA.C. Heighington K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2014I agree with my brother Davis that in the circumstances of this case the action could only succeed on proof of the absence of reasonable and probable cause.\nI agree also with my brother Davis and my brother Taschereau that special damage was not proved.\nOn both these grounds the appeal should, I think, be allowed, but without costs in this Court or in the Court of Appeal.\nThe judgment of Rinfret, Davis and Hudson JJ. was delivered by\nDAVIS J.\u2014The action out of which this appeal arises had two branches but we are only concerned in the appeal with one branch, what has been referred to as a claim for damages for maintenance. The respondent alleged that the appellant, who is a solicitor practising in Toronto, \u201cby officious intermeddling, improperly and maliciously, and for the purpose of stirring up litigation and strife and without having any interest in the suit, instigated, stirred up, encouraged and advised\u201d the respondent\u2019s wife \u201cto commence and prosecute an action\u201d against him in which she claimed alimony amongst other relief.\nThe facts as found by the trial judge are not in dispute. The respondent was married in Montreal on December 11th, 1930. Husband and wife immediately went to Toronto. Four days after the marriage they separated and the wife returned to her father\u2019s home in Grand\u2019M\u00e8re, Quebec, and has apparently remained there ever since. The husband continued to reside in Toronto. In the spring of 1931 and subsequently, the trial judge found, the wife attempted to bring about a reconciliation between herself and the respondent and offered to return and live with him as his wife, but the respondent spurned her offers. It was not until June 1st, 1938, however, that the wife took any action against her husband, at which time she commenced an action in Ontario against him and claimed alimony. That action went down to trial at Toronto before Chief Justice Rose in February, 1939, and after some evidence was given the parties agreed to a settlement. By the settlement the husband agreed to pay his wife $500 per annum for life and to deposit securities with a trustee as security for the said payments. He also agreed to pay his wife\u2019s costs fixed at $700. Judgment was given in the action declaring the settlement binding upon the parties. The respondent has complied with all the terms of the settlement.\nThe respondent in the present action seeks to recover damages against the appellant for instigating and stirring up his wife to commence and prosecute the action for alimony. What is said in effect is that the wife had been living in Quebec province for over seven years separate and apart from her husband and making no claim against him; that the appellant then maliciously put the idea into her head of bringing an action in Ontario against her husband for alimony. The appellant appears to have known and been a friend of both husband and wife, though the trial judge finds that he had not seen or heard from her from 1931 till November, 1937, during which time he had acted as the husband\u2019s solicitor and during which time the wife apparently had never contemplated any legal proceedings against her husband. The appellant then became annoyed with the respondent over a legal account and began a corre- spondence with the wife in Quebec, stirring her up to commence an action in Ontario against her husband.\nIt is plain that in the strict sense of the term there was no \u201cmaintenance\u201d of the alimony action by the appellant. What he did was merely to put the idea of bringing the action into her head. She consulted another solicitor in Toronto, who advised the action and who subsequently brought the action on her behalf. The appellant had nothing whatever to do with the action itself. In the case of civil proceedings, however, while there cannot be \u201cmaintenance\u201d in the strict sense of the term until the action is commenced (Flight v. Leman[3]), a person who, without reasonable and probable cause, instigates another to bring an action incurs a civil liability to the defendant similar to that incurred by a maintainer. See the judgment of Lord Alverstone, C.J., in Greig v. The National Amalgamated Union[4], Halsbury, 2nd ed., Vol. I, p. 71, para. 87 (s) and (t). But the action is only maintainable in respect of legal damage actually sustained. Cotterell v. Jones[5]; and the decision of the House of Lords in the Neville case[6].\nThe learned trial judge dismissed the respondent\u2019s action, but the Court of Appeal reversed the judgment and gave damages for the respondent in the sum of $4,000, and from that judgment this appeal has been brought to this Court. The judgment of the Court of Appeal obviously went on the basis that the respondent\u2019s wife had really no valid claim against her husband and that it could not say that in the settlement of the action the husband was only discharging his just debts. But that action went to trial and during the course of the hearing the respondent, who was represented by experienced counsel, made the settlement of the action above referred to, and I do not see how it can be said in this action that that was not the recognition by the husband of a legal obligation on him towards his wife or that the apellant, who stirred up the litigation, was the cause of the respondent having to make the payments under the judgment. The husband has to make the payments under the judgment because he is the husband and entered into an agreement with his wife which became crystallized in the judgment. At least it can scarcely be said that the wife had no right to bring the action. While I think it plain that the appellant instigated the bringing of the action, the appellant could only be made liable to the respondent in respect of legal damage actually sustained by him.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the judgment at the trial restored, but in view of the conduct of the appellant I think he should not be awarded any costs, either in this Court or in the Court of Appeal.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I believe that the appellant intermeddled in a matter in which he had no concern. He interfered in such a way that Marcelle Collin conceived the idea of instituting against her husband, Max Arno Frind, an action for alimony, and enforced rights which she did not seem disposed to enforce. (Goodman v. The King) [7].\nThe appellant for many years had been the respondent\u2019s solicitor, and a quarrel relative to a bill of costs brought about a rupture of their friendly relations. It was then, as revealed by the evidence, that the appellant by his letters to the wife incited her and improperly encouraged her to prosecute an action in which he had no legal interest, thus stirring up a litigation against the respondent.\nIt is plain that the appellant technically incurred a civil liability, but it is claimed on his behalf that even if he did instigate a law suit, the judgment of the Court of Appeal ordering him to pay $4,000 and costs should be reversed, because no special damage has been occasioned to the plaintiff. The rule as laid down by the House of Lords in Neville v. London \u201cExpress\u201d Newspaper, Ltd. [8], is that the action for maintenance at common law is not an action for the invasion of a right; it is an action in respect of an offence which causes damage to the plaintiff. As Lord Finlay says: \u201cThe criminal law prohibits and may punish the act, but in the absence of damage the remedy is not by civil action.\u201d Even nominal or exemplary damages may not be recovered. The plaintiff must have sustained special damage. In the present case, the respondent\u2019s wife enforced her rights to claim an alimony, and after an agreement had been reached by the parties, Chief Justice Rose ordered her husband, Frind, to pay to his wife $500 annually, and costs, and, to guarantee the payment of the alimony, he had to deposit with a Trust Company securities to the value of $10,000. This payment was clearly the discharge of a legal obligation. The amount paid by a debtor as the result of the exercise of a creditor\u2019s rights, even if the latter has been improperly induced to prosecute the action, may not be recovered as damages by the debtor against the maintainer. These payments in capital and costs do not constitute the special damages which are recoverable before the courts. The same thing may be said respecting costs paid by a defendant to his solicitor and incurred in a vain attempt to oppose the claim.\nIn the Neville case cited supra, Lord Finlay in his speech expressed as follows the views of the majority:\u2014\nIn the present case, there is no damage. The plaintiff, it is true, has had to repay money which he had obtained by fraud and to pay costs in respect of his having resisted payment. It cannot be regarded as damage sufficient to maintain an action that the plaintiff has had to discharge his legal obligations or that he has incurred expenses in endeavouring to evade them.\nThese principles should be applied to this case where no special damage has been proven. The appeal should be allowed, but in view of the circumstances of the case, I would not award the appellant any costs, here and in the Court of Appeal.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Phelan, Richardson, O\u2019Brien & Phelan.\nSolicitors for the respondent: A. and E.F.

VI, c. 49, s 20.\nThe respondent, a joint-committee constituted as a corporation under the Quebec Workmen's Wages Act, claimed from the appellant, under the provisions of section 20 (k) of the Act, on behalf and for the benefit of over 200 workers and apprentices, a sum of $4,790.93, amount alleged to be due for wages under a collective agreement; and also claimed under other provisions of the Act further sums, payable to the respondent itself, of $753.97 as liquidated damages and $27.40 as penalty. Nearly all the individual claims were under $100 and none of them exceeded $200. The respondent's action was maintained by the trial judge, which judgment was affirmed by the appellate court. The respondent moved to quash an appeal to this Court for want of jurisdiction.\nHeld that no appeal lies to this Court from the judgment appealed from. Cousins v. Harding, ([1940] S.C.R. 442) followed.\nMOTION on behalf of the respondent for an order quashing the appeal to this Court, which was brought from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming the judgment of the trial judge, White J., and maintaining the respondent's action.\nThe material facts of the case and the question at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nJean Genest K.C. for the motion.\nE. Veilleux contra.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by Rinfret J.\u2014Motion to quash for want of jurisdiction.\nThe respondent is a committee which, by the Quebec Workmen's Wages Act (c. 49 of the statute I Geo. VI, 1937), is constituted a corporation and has the powers, rights and privileges appertaining to ordinary civil corporations (s. 20).\nIt may\ndemand from any employer and any employee violating the provisions of a decree respecting wages an amount equal to 20% of the difference between the wage made obligatory and that actually paid;\nand such amount is \"accorded as liquidated damages.\"\nThen the statute (s. 20k) provides that the committee may\nNotwithstanding any law to the contrary, institute, for the benefit of the employee who has not taken action and caused same to be served within one month from the due date of his salary or wages or who having taken action does not proceed with all possible diligence, any action in his favour arising out of the decree, without having to establish an assignment of claim from the person concerned and in spite of any express or implied renunciation by the latter.\nThe claims of several employees against the same employer may be joined in the same suit.\nNo employer sued by the committee may set up any grounds by way of cross demand.\nThe amount claimed as liquidated damages may be added to the amount of the claim.\nThe claim shall be deemed a summary matter and be prosecuted as such.\nIn this case, Le Comit\u00e9 Paritaire demanded $4,790.93\npour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice et avantage des ouvriers, apprentis et ouvri\u00e8res ci-dessus mentionn\u00e9s, chacun des dits employes devant b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier du jugement rendu, en faveur du demandeur, pour le montant lui revenant, \u00e0 titre de solde de salaire, tel que sus-mentionn\u00e9; conclut en outre le demandeur \u00e0 ce que la d\u00e9fenderesse soit condamn\u00e9e \u00e0 lui payer, \u00e0 lui-m\u00eame, \u00e0 titre de d\u00f3mmages liquid\u00e9s, une somme de $753.97, repr\u00e9sentant 20% des r\u00e9clamations des ouvriers et une autre somme de $37.67 repr\u00e9sentant un pr\u00e9l\u00e8vement de 1% conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions de la loi I Geo. VI, ch. 49 et de ses amendements.\nThe parties later admitted\nthat, if the Defendant Company was liable on the action instituted, the amount for which the Company was responsible was $3,568.40, plus one per cent. i.e., $27.40, and also an indemnity of 20% making in all $4,309.48.\nThe appellant lost both in the Superior Court and in the Court of King's Bench (appeal side). It then launched a further appeal to this Court; and the respondent moves to quash this appeal on the ground that the Court has no jurisdiction to hear it.\nIn our opinion, no material distinction can be made between this case and the case of Cousins v. Harding[1], where it was held that\nthe mere fact that several plaintiffs have joined their claims in a single action does not affect our jurisdiction * * * Each claim by itself must be considered as separate for purposes of jurisdiction.\nIn that case, the claims of several employees against the same employer were cumulated in a single action, as authorized under sec. 22 of the Fair Wages Act. Under that Act, the employees brought their action in their own name, but several of them had joined in the action. It is true that, as pointed out by the appellant, by the procedure under the Quebec Workmen's Wages Act, which governs the present case, instead of the employees joining together and cumulating their claims in a single action, the action is brought in the name of the Committee. This is an exception to article 81 of the Code of Civil Procedure, whereby \"a person cannot use the name of another to plead.\" But that exception does not go any further than to authorize the bringing of an action for the several claims of the employees in the name of the committee; otherwise it is made clear by the wording of the statute that the committee itself has no monetary interest in the wages sued for. The action is brought \"for the benefit of the employee.\" There is no \"assignment of claim\" from the employee concerned; and the conclusions of the declaration in the case now under discussion are strictly along those lines, since the committee prayed for judgment\npour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice et avantage des ouvriers, etc., chacun des dits employ\u00e9s devant b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier du jugement rendu en faveur du demandeur pour le montant lui revenant \u00e0 titre de solde de salaire.\nIn the declaration, a list of the employees concerned is given with the amount or \"solde de salaire\" claimed on behalf of each of them. We do not doubt that the appellant could have filed\u2014and, as a matter of fact, it did file\u2014 a defence alleging facts peculiar to each individual claim and having nothing to do whatever with the claim of another employee in the list.\nThe \"solde de salaire\" demanded on behalf of the employee in no case exceeds two hundred dollars. In the great majority of them, the sum claimed is below one hundred dollars. Indeed, were it not for the amount claimed as liquidated damages representing \"20% of the difference between the wage made obligatory and that actually paid\" ($753.97), none of the amounts mentioned would be within the competency of the Court of King's Bench (appeal side), and a fortiori within the jurisdiction of this Court. Moreover, as pointed out in Cousins v. Harding[2], the statute is only permissive and not compulsory.\nWe think the motion ought to be granted and the appeal quashed.\nBut the security on appeal to this Court was given and approved on the 24th day of January, 1941. The respondent might have made its motion to quash and brought it for hearing either at the February sittings or at the April sittings. Notice of motion was given only on the 26th day of September, 1941, with the result that, in the meantime, the appellant had caused the case to be printed and the appeal is set down for hearing at the present sittings of the Court. If the motion had been made promptly, as it should have been, all these costs and expenses would have been avoided. They may not be recovered from the respondent by the appellant, in view of the fact that the appellant itself should have realized that the Court was without jurisdiction to hear the appeal; but, under the circumstances, the respondent is also responsible for the delay and he should, on that account, be awarded no costs on its motion.\nThe motion will be granted without costs.\nMotion granted without costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Gaston Desmarais.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Beaulieu, Gouin, Bourdon, Beaulieu & Montpetit.\n[1] [1940] S.C.R. 442.\n[2] [1940] S.C.R. 442.\n",

He died on August 26th, 1934. His will appointed his wife, Jane, executrix and devised all his real and personal estate to her. The will was admitted to probate on August 13th, 1935. At the time of John McE.'s death, the whole of the mortgage debt was owing to the respondent, as well as a large sum for accumulated interest. The respondent, acting under the powers contained in its mortgage, leased the land to Robert J. McE. for terms from November, 1934, to November, 1936, and the widow continued to live on the farm until her death in 1940. In July, 1936, a proposal under the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, 1934, was filed by the latter, in her personal capacity and not as executrix, with the Official Receiver, the only debts disclosed being the amount due to the respondent under its mortgage and a sum of $170 for taxes. Actually, Jane McE. had never assumed payment of the mortgage debt or interest, nor had she in any way obligated herself to the respondent. At the time of filing her proposal, the certificate of title to the land was held by the widow, not as owner but only as executrix. In October, 1936, she, as personal representative, purported to transfer the land to herself personally for an expressed consideration of $1, and a certificate of title was issued to her; but the estate had not yet been fully administered. Immediately upon receipt of notice of the proposal and again in November, 1936, the respondent advised the Official Receiver that it had no claim against Jane McE. and that she was not entitled to the benefit of the Act; and later, in March, 1937, the respondent's solicitors wrote to the Registrar of the Board of Review asserting lack of jurisdiction on the part of the Board. The Board of Review, in October, 1937, formulated its proposal, reducing the amount of the respondent's mortgage, and confirmed it in October, 1938. The respondent, in October, 1939, on its behalf as well as on behalf of all the creditors of the deceased, brought an action against the widow, both as executrix and in her own right, to have her required to administer the estate, to have the transfer of the land to herself as owner set aside and to have the land sold to discharge the respondent's debt. The Board's proposal was pleaded as a bar to the action, such proposal having allegedly operated to extinguish the liability of the estate. Jane McE. died in March, 1940, and probate of her will was granted to the appellants, Robert J. McE. and Edith McE. who obtained registration of the land in their names as personal representatives. On June 19th, 1940, they transferred the land to themselves in their personal capacities, and, on the same day, they both joined in a transfer to Robert J. McE. who became the registered owner. The respondent, in September, 1940, launched before the Court of Appeal for Manitoba an application for certiorari in order to bring the proposal before that Court and have it quashed. The Court of Appeal ordered the issue of the writ and later on made an order declaring the proposal to be beyond the powers of the Board of Review and directing that it be quashed.\nHeld, Davis J. dissenting, that the judgment of the Court of Appeal ([1941] 1 W.W.R. 129) should be affirmed.\nPer the Chief Justice: Upon the admitted facts of this case, the land in question, before the transfer of it to herself in October, 1936, was not the property of Jane McE. in the sense of the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act. Being beneficially entitled to the residue of her husband's estate, she was entitled to have the land, subject to the rights of the mortgagee, applied in payment of the debts of the estate; and as legal personal representative, it was her duty to see that this was done. As the estate was admittedly insolvent, she had no interest in the land which could lawfully be made available to satisfy her personal debts if she had any. Under such circumstances she could not properly transfer the land to herself. The purpose of such transfer was evidently prompted by the supposition that it might enable her to bring the land and the mortgage debt within reach of the machinery of the Act. With such facts before them, the Board of Review ought to have declined to act on the proposal made by Jane McE. on the ground that they were confronted by a manifest abuse of the statutory procedure; and, if the question had been raised by an application to the Court, it must inevitably have been held that by such devices the creditors of the estate could not be deprived of their rights.\u2014Moreover, even assuming that, the title to the farm being vested in Jane McE. in virtue of the certificate of title or of the transfer to her in October, 1936, it was her property in the sense of the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, 1934, and that the mortgage debt could be deemed to be her debt for the purposes of the Act, the amendments of 1938 to that Act which, it was contended, brought her into privity of contract with the mortgagee, had no application, for the reason that section 19 of that Act, added thereto by statute of 1935, c. 20, provides that the \"Act shall not, without the concurrence of the creditor, apply in the case of any debt incurred after May 1, 1935\": the essential condition being that the property affected by the security shall have been the property of the debtor in the sense of the amending statute, consequently, the mortgage debt in this case never became (constructively) the debt of Jane McE. until long after that date.\u2014A \"debt\" (if it be a mortgage debt) cannot be \"incurred\" in the sense of section 19 before the property or interest on which it is charged has become the \"property\" of the debtor within the contemplation of section 2 (d) of the statute.\nPer Rinfret, Crocket and Hudson JJ.\u2014Under the circumstances of the case, Jane McE. was not entitled to file a proposal under The Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, for the reasons that she was not the owner of the land and that there was no privity of contract between her and the respondent company. She was in no way the \"debtor\" of the respondent within the requirements of the Act, even after the introduction of the amendment of 1938 to section 2(d). The only debt appearing in the proposal formulated by the Board of Review was the respondent's mortgage account; that was not her debt, so much so that the respondent could not have sued her for it; it was not a \"debt provable in bankruptcy\" against her, or against her estate in bankruptcy: the sole object of the procedure being to obtain a reduction on the debt owing to the respondent by the estate. Therefore, under the circumstances of this case, the Board of Review had no jurisdiction to deal with the respondent's mortgage debt and more particularly to reduce the rate of interest on that mortgage; and the Board could not, consistently with the provisions of the Act, deal with Jane McE.'s request, or formulate a proposal, in complete disregard of the position and interest of the respondent.\u2014Also, the provisions of section 2 (d) of the Act, as amended by c. 47 of 1938, defining the word \"creditor\" did not confer any greater jurisdiction upon the Board in the present case; the object of the amended definition has apparently enlarged the class of \"creditors\", but did not alter the status of the \"debtor\".\u2014Moreover, section 19 of the Act, above referred to, finds application in this case: \"the debt incurred,\" referred to in that section, is necessarily a debt personally incurred by an applicant and does not concern a debt which, though at present owing by the applicant farmer towards the creditor, had been incurred by a previous debtor (who may not have been a farmer) and at a date prior to the first day of May, 1935, as it is in the present case.\u2014Therefore the proposals formulated by the Board of Review were made without authority and jurisdiction and were invalid. It should also be held that the Court of Appeal had power to deal with the matter in controversy in this case on an application for certiorari by the respondent; that the preliminary questions raised by the respondent were of such a nature that, in an ordinary case, they would properly give rise to an inquiry on certiorari by a superior court and that, for the purposes of that inquiry, the facts bearing on the question of jurisdiction could be put before that Court by means of affidavits.\nPer Davis J. dissenting\u2014In view of all the facts and circumstances of this case, on one hand, the conduct of the respondent throughout has been such as to disentitle it to relief in certiorari proceedings and, on the other hand, allowance of the appeal would put the appellants the Board of Review, the Registrar, the executors of Mrs. Jane McE. and her son R. J. McE. to the burden of excessive and unnecessary costs of litigation.\u2014The effect of the lodging by Mrs. Jane McE. with the Official Receiver of a composition, extension or scheme of arrangement, on July 31st, 1936, was to put the subject-matter of the proposal into the exclusive jurisdiction, subject to appeal, of the County Court of Dauphin, which was the judicial district where Mrs. McE. resided and the farm was located; such district being designated by section 5 (1) of The Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act. And the Act moreover gave to the Board of Review a right to work out a proposal which might involve secured creditors, even in the absence of their concurrence. Although the respondent had the right at its own risk to deliberately ignore the proceedings under the Act, on the alleged grounds that Mrs. Jane McE. was not its debtor and that it was not a secured creditor, a very convenient and speedy remedy was available to the respondent when it got notice of Mrs. Jane McE.'s application with the Official Receiver, by moving at once in the County Court to have the proposal set aside upon any of the grounds alleged by the respondent in its present proceeding by way of certiorari. The county judge would have certainly entertained any such application and would have dealt with the matter at the time in a speedy and inexpensive manner; and, moreover, a statutory right to appeal from any decision so rendered would have been available to the respondent.\nAPPEAL, by leave of appeal granted by the Court of Appeal for Manitoba from the judgment of that Court[1], allowing a motion in certiorari proceedings to quash an order by the Board of Review for Manitoba under The Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, 1934, confirming a proposal thereunder.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nH. A. Bergman K.C. for the appellants, the Board of Review and the Registrar.\nA. T. Warnock for the appellants R. J. and I. E. McEwen.\nW. C. Hamilton K.C. for the respondent.\nH. A. Bergman K.C. and D. W. Mundell for the Attorney-General of Canada. The Chief Justice.\u2014Jane McEwen's right to avail herself of the enactments of The Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act as amended in 1938 necessarily rested upon two propositions:\nfirst, that the farm which she as the legal personal representative of her husband had transferred to herself and for which she had procured a certificate of title to be issued to herself personally was her \"property\" within the meaning of sec. 2 (d) of the statute as amended in 1938;\nand second, that the respondent company was a \"secured creditor\" within the meaning of the amending enactments of 1938.\nOn the admitted facts it is not open to dispute that before the transfer of it to herself in October, 1936, the land was not her property in the sense of the statute. Being beneficially entitled to the residue of her husband's estate, she was of course entitled to have the land, subject to the rights of the mortgagees, applied in payment of the debts of the estate; and as legal personal representative it was her plain duty to see that this was done. As the estate was admittedly insolvent, the assets being insufficient to meet the mortgage debt, she had, of course, no interest in the land which could lawfully be made available to satisfy her personal debts if she had any. She ought to have been advised that in the circumstances she could not properly transfer the land to herself. The purpose of this transfer is plain; it was prompted by the supposition that it might enable her to bring the land and the mortgage debt within reach of the machinery of the Act. With the facts before them, the Board of Review ought to have declined to act on Mrs. McEwen's proposal (of the 31st July, 1936) on the ground that they were confronted by a manifest abuse of the statutory procedure. Had the question been raised by an application to the Court, it must inevitably have been held that by such devices the creditors of the estate could not be deprived of their rights.\nThis alone would be a sufficient ground for dismissing the appeal; because the Court of Appeal having held that the remedy by certiorari is properly applicable, I think with the greatest respect that we are not required, in such a palpable case of abuse of statutory procedure, to hold that their exercise of discretion is vitiated by reason of the grounds relied upon by Mr. Bergman. This appeal, however, may be considered on the assumption that the title to the farm being vested in Mrs. McEwen in virtue of the certificate of title of the 20th October, 1936, or of the transfer to her of the 14th October, 1936, it was her property in the sense of The Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, and that it was (from this point of view) sufficient that it should be so at the date when the Board of Review formulated their proposal, in order to give the Board jurisdiction in that behalf. Under the provisions of the amending statute of 1938 the respondent company is to be deemed by construction of law to have been at the date when the proposal was formulated by the Board of Review a secured creditor of Mrs. McEwen and the mortgage debt is deemed to be her debt, for the purposes of the Act.\nAs Mr. Bergman said in argument, the mortgage debt was, by force of the Act, her debt for the purposes of the Act. It would appear that the amending Statute of 1938 takes effect retrospectively at the date of the formulation of the proposal by the Board (if a proposal has been formulated) otherwise at the filing of the proposal of the debtor. But the essential condition is that the property affected by the security shall have been the property of the debtor in the sense of the amending statute; and consequently the mortgage debt in question here never became (constructively) the debt of Mrs. McEwen until long after the 1st of May, 1935.\nWithin the intendment of sec. 19 the debt is \"incurred\" when it is \"incurred\" by the debtor; the mortgage debt in question was \"incurred\" in that sense, constructively, by force of the amending Statute (the only sense in which it was ever \"incurred\"), when that Statute came into force in 1938, and, by relation, at a date not earlier than the date of the certificate of title of the 20th October, 1936, or than that of the transfer of October 14th, 1936.\nDebts so constructively \"incurred\" (in virtue of the amending statute) are in my opinion within the intendment of sec. 19; and, I repeat, such a \"debt\" (if it be a mortgage debt) cannot be \"incurred\" in the sense of that section before the property or interest on which it is charged has become the \"property\" of the debtor within the contemplation of sec. 2 (d) of the statute. On this point, as to the application of sec. 19, I respectfully concur with Mr. Justice Trueman.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs. The judgment of Rinfret, Crocket and Hudson JJ. was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014The facts of this case are complicated.\nIn September, 1919, one John McEwen, then of Dauphin, Manitoba, now deceased, borrowed four thousand dollars ($4,000) from the respondent and executed a mortgage upon his land in favour of the latter. The mortgage provided for repayment instalments of $250 on November 1st in each of the years 1921 to 1923 inclusive, and of the balance on November 1st, 1924, with interest at seven per cent per annum, payable annually.\nJohn McEwen died on August 26th, 1934. Probate of his will was granted to his widow, Jane McEwen, on August 13th, 1935. By the will, the deceased after directing payment of his debts, devised and bequeathed all his real and personal estate to his widow.\nAt the time of John McEwen's death, the whole of the mortgage debt was owing to the respondent, as well as a large sum for accumulated interest thereon.\nThe respondent, acting under the powers contained in its mortgage, leased the land to Robert James McEwen for a term from November 7th, 1934, to November 1st, 1935, and for a further term from February 3rd to November 1st, 1936.\nOn or about July 31st, 1936, Jane McEwen, in her personal capacity, and not as executrix, filed with the Official Receiver of the Dauphin Judicial District a proposal purporting to be made under The Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, 1934. The only debts disclosed by the proposal were the amount owing to the respondent under its mortgage, there placed at $6,000, and the further sum of $170 payable to the Rural Municipality of Dauphin in respect of taxes.\nActually, Jane McEwen had never assumed payment of the mortgage debt or interest, nor had she in any way obligated herself to the respondent.\nAt the time of filing her proposal, Jane McEwen was not the owner of the land, although afterwards, on October 20th, 1936, she, as personal representative, purported to transfer the land to herself in her personal capacity for an expressed consideration of $1. By the proposal, Jane McEwen asked that the respondent's debt be reduced to $2,500, with interest at 6 per cent. spread over a period of fifteen years, and that other accounts be not affected. Outside of the sum due to the municipality of Dauphin for taxes, Jane McEwen apparently was not indebted to any person whomsoever.\nBy the proposal, she valued the land at $2,500. When applying for probate, she had valued it at $3,000. Afterwards, on August 17th, 1937, she insured the buildings for $4,050.\nImmediately upon receipt of notice of the proposal, the respondent advised the Official Receiver that it had no claim against Jane McEwen and that it was not affected by the proposal. On November 28th, 1936, the respondent again wrote the Official Receiver that Jane McEwen was not a debtor and not entitled to the benefit of the Act.\nLater, on March 29th, 1937, the respondent's solicitors wrote to the Registrar of the Board of Review, setting forth fully the objections of the respondent and asserting lack of jurisdiction on the part of the Board.\nThe Board heard the application on March 31st, 1937, and, on October 29th, 1937, purported to formulate a proposal. The respondent's mortgage account was the only obligation attempted to be dealt with. The proposal states that the amount of that debt as of November 1st, 1936, stood at $6,336.65. At the date of the proposal, another year's interest had accrued, so that the actual amount owing at that time would be $6,678.15.\nThe Board proceeded to direct a reduction to $2,800, with future interest at 6 per cent. The respondent dissented, as appears from a letter from its solicitors to the Registrar, dated November 9th, 1937.\nThe Board gave no effect to the various protests and objections of the respondent and confirmed the proposal on October 5th, 1938.\nThe respondent further, on several occasions, advised both Jane McEwen and Robert James McEwen, as well as Mr. A. T. Warnock, the Official Receiver, who was also apparently acting as their solicitor, that it would not be bound by or recognize the proposal. The respondent's attitude was definite and consistent throughout.\nOn October 10th, 1939, the respondent commenced an administration action in the Court of King's Bench against Jane McEwen, both as executrix of her husband's estate and also in her personal capacity. The action was brought on behalf of the respondent itself, as well as on behalf of all the creditors of the deceased. By its statement of claim, the respondent took the position that the debt of the deceased to the respondent was unaffected by the proposal, that the full amount was still owing and that the conveyance of the land to Jane McEwen as a devisee before satisfying the debts of the deceased constituted a breach of her duties as executrix. The respondent asked that the estate be administered, the conveyance set aside and the land sold to discharge the respondent's debt.\nThe statement of defence delivered by Jane McEwen as executrix urged that the proposal had operated to extinguish the liability of the estate. The respondent, by its reply, after setting up that the estate was not a party to the proceedings before the Board of Review, contended that the Board was without authority to deal with the matter.\nIt is stated that, at the request of defendant's solicitor, made because of the illness of his client, the litigation was not pressed for the time being.\nJane McEwen died on March 27th, 1940; and, on May 9th, 1940, probate of her will was granted to the appellants, Robert James McEwen and Isabella Edith McEwen. On April 28th, 1940, the respondent's solicitors wrote the solicitor for the appellant estate asking to be advised of the issue of the grant of probate. The necessary information was given by a letter dated June 29th, 1940.\nIt then appeared that, following the grant of probate of the will of Jane McEwen, the appellants Robert James McEwen and Isabella Edith McEwen had obtained registration of the land in their names, as personal representatives.\nOn June 19th, 1940, they transferred the land to themselves in their personal capacities; and, on the same day, they both joined in a transfer to Robert James McEwen, who became the registered owner. The respondent then felt compelled to take some step to have the proposal made by the Board of Review declared to be of no effect. For that purpose, on September 17th, 1940, the respondent issued a notice of motion to be made to the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, in order that the proposal be brought before that Court by way of a writ of certiorari, and so that an application to have it quashed might be proceeded with.\nThe Court of Appeal ordered the issue of the writ, to which a return was made by the appellants, the Chief Commissioner, the Commissioners and the Registrar of the Board of Review for the province of Manitoba.\nFollowing the return, an order declaring the proposal to be beyond the powers of the Board, and directing that it be quashed, was made by the Court of Appeal. That order is now appealed from, leave to appeal having been granted by the Court of Appeal of Manitoba.\nBefore this Court, the appellant Board of Review and the appellants Robert James McEwen and Isabella Edith McEwen appeared separately; but their grounds of appeal are substantially the same. They contend that the court a quo should have refused the motion for a writ of certiorari because it had no power to deal with such a matter under the Act and the rules as well as under the procedure set up by the King's Bench Act; that the proposal returned into court pursuant to the writ of certiorari constituted the only and entire record before the court on the motion to quash and it was not open to the court to go behind the return and to consider extraneous material; that the majority of the court, in effect, dealt with the case as if it were an appeal from the decision of the Board of Review and failed to keep within the limits of its jurisdiction on certiorari; that the application for certiorari was, in any event, barred by delay, prejudice and estoppel; that the court erred in holding that Jane McEwen did not properly administer the estate and, therefore, improperly conveyed title to herself, or in holding that, at the date of the filing of the proposal (July 31st, 1936), she was not the owner of the land; and finally that there was error in the holding of the court that the proposal of the Board of Review was a nullity, owing to absence of privity of contract between Jane McEwen and the company, as a consequence of the wrong interpretation of The Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act as amended in 1938. The grounds of appeal may, in reality, be grouped under two heads:\n(1) The Court of Appeal erred in deciding that Jane McEwen was not entitled to file a proposal under the Act, because she was not the owner of the land, and because there was no privity of contract between her and the respondent company;\n(2) The Court of Appeal had no jurisdiction to deal with these matters through a writ of certiorari; and it could not, pursuant to that writ, go behind the proposal of the Board of Review, whose jurisdiction, on the only record before the Court, was on its face conclusive.\nDealing first with head no. 1: In order that the Board of Review may have power and jurisdiction to formulate or confirm the proposal it did, on the application of Jane McEwen, it was necessary that she should be a farmer unable to meet her liabilities as they became due, and also that she should be the debtor of the respondent company which, in effect, in the premises, was her only alleged creditor. Otherwise, it stands to reason that the respondent could not be brought in the scheme of arrangement under the Act; and the Board of Review, in formulating its proposal, and subsequently in confirming it, exceeded its powers, authority and jurisdiction.\nI think the recent decision in Diewold v. Diewold[2] is conclusive on that point, so far at least as this Court is concerned.\nThe mortgage debt owing to the respondent, and which the proposal purported to reduce, was incurred by the deceased John McEwen. No other person ever assumed or personally became responsible for it before any application was made for a proposal. Following the death of John McEwen, the respondent had the right to look to his estate for payment of its debt.\nThe application which resulted in the proposal now under consideration was an application made by Jane McEwen in her personal capacity.\nAt that time (July 31st, 1936), Jane McEwen was not the debtor of the respondent and, moreover, was not insolvent. She was not, therefore, entitled to invoke the benefits of the Act, not to speak of the disputed question whether she could be classed as a farmer.\nHad she come within that class, the only proposal which she could file with the Official Receiver was a proposal in respect of her actual personal obligations.\nOn the face of the proposal formulated by the Board, the only debt disclosed, for which she was liable, was the sum of $91 owing to The International Harvester Company of Canada, Limited, incurred in 1936 and which could not be the subject of a personal proposal.\nThe only other debt appearing in the proposal is the respondent's mortgage account. That was not her debt. The respondent could not have sued her for it. It was not a \"debt provable in bankruptcy\" against her, or against her estate in bankruptcy.\nAs it turned out, it seemed pretty clear that the sole object of the proceeding was to obtain a reduction in the debt owing to the respondent by the John McEwen Estate. Jane McEwen herself apparently was not indebted to any person whomsoever.\nIn order to bring the debt of the estate first before the Official Receiver, and then before the Board, the Act, at that time, contained no provision under which its benefits could be invoked. It was only in 1938, by the amendment adding sec. 6 (A) to the Act (sec. 4 of C. 47 of the statutes of Canada, 1938), that provision was made for proposals by legal representatives of farmers who died after the 3rd day of July, 1934, upon satisfying certain conditions there mentioned and obtaining leave of the court. This procedure was never resorted to in the present case.\nUp to that amendment, it had been consistently held that an executor could only proceed as such, and not as a farmer; and, as a Board of Review could only deal with debts of farmers in order to keep them on the land, the necessary jurisdiction was lacking.\nThe form of the proposal herein and of everything connected therewith was, throughout, essentially a proceeding on behalf and for the benefit of the John McEwen estate ; and the only personal interest of Jane McEwen shewn therein was that her name appeared in it and purported to be signed, not by her, but \"per Robert J. McEwen, her agent\". It was the latter who verified the statement of affairs and who signed the statutory declaration before the Official Receiver.\nThe first duty of Jane McEwen as executrix of the estate of her deceased husband was to administer properly the estate and to apply the assets in reduction of the debts before any conveyance to a beneficiary. I need not here discuss the point whether, when attempting to transfer the land to herself, she committed a breach of trust, and, notwithstanding such transfer, she should be treated as a trustee for the creditors of the John McEwen's estate. It is sufficient to state that the security given by John McEwen for the respondent's loan could not be released, reduced or affected, so long as the liability of the estate existed, by means of a proposal made and filed by Jane McEwen personally.\nUnder the circumstances, the Board of Review had no jurisdiction to deal with the respondent's mortgage debt. More particularly, it had no authority to reduce the rate of interest on that mortgage; and the Board of Review could not, consistently with the provisions of The Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, deal with her request, or formulate a proposal, in complete disregard of the position and interest of the respondent.\nIt need not be said that, so that the Act may be validly invoked, it is not sufficient that there should be a debt; it is necessary that the applicant farmer should be the debtor of such a debt. Here, there was undoubtedly a debt, but the applicant for relief was not the debtor. The debtor was the John McEwen estate, which refrained from making an application, although it might have done so after the amending legislation of 1938.\nOn behalf of the appellants, it was argued that another amendment introduced by that legislation (1938), and to which reference has not yet been made, has had the effect of doing away with the necessity of some privity of contract between the applicant for a proposal and the creditor.\nUp till then, the Court of Appeal for Ontario, in Gofton v. Shantz[3] and in Nesbitt v. Hogg[4] had held that the Act did not apply where the relation of debtor and creditor did not exist, as here. It was claimed, however, by the appellants that sec. 2(d) of the Act, as amended by ch. 47 of the statutes of 1938, conferred jurisdiction upon the Board in this instance.\nThe subsection just referred to provides:\n(d) \"Creditor\" includes a secured creditor and, notwithstanding the absence of privity of contract between the debtor and any of the persons hereinafter mentioned, a person holding a mortgage, hypothec, pledge, charge, lien or privilege on or against the property of the debtor or any part thereof and, in case the debtor holds real property under an agreement of sale or under an assignment of an agreement of sale, the vendor of such property or any person entitled under an assignment by such vendor.\nI do not think this new section helps the appellants.\nThe object of the amended definition appears to have been to enlarge the class of \"creditors\"; but it does not alter the status of the \"debtor\". This was pointed out by Masten, J. A., in Swaffield v. Baycroft[5]. In that case, neither the holder of the mortgage, nor the owner of the land, was an original party to the mortgage; but the owner of the land had by an extension agreement specifically covenanted to pay the debt. Having become a \"debtor\", he would have come within the purview of the Act but for the fact that the extension agreement was entered into after May 1st, 1935, and that, by force of sec. 19, the Act \"does not, without the consent of the creditor, apply in the case of any debt incurred after\" that date.\nMasten J.A., in my view, properly set forth the limits of the new definition:\nBut there is nothing in the Act of 1938 which brings the situation within the principal Act if the farmer who is in possession does not owe the debt secured by the mortgage. By the statute of 1938 a limitation on this right additional to that created by the original Act is imposed on the holder for the time being of a security against the farm of the debtor; that is all. The rights and liabilities of the debtor are not referred to in the Act of 1938, and, in my view, are not affected.\n***\nAnd I should only add that, in my view, it is impossible to conceive that the statutory alteration in the definition of \"creditor\" carries with it by implication a corresponding alteration in the common law meaning of \"debtor\". That would, in my view, be legislation by the Court.\nIndependently of the language of section 2(d), which does not purport to enlarge the class of \"debtors,\" it should be noticed that the new definition therein contained still requires, notwithstanding the absence of privity of contract between the applicant and the \"person holding a mortgage, hypothec, pledge, charge, lien or privilege,\" that the mortgage or hypothec, etc., must be a mortgage or hypothec \"on or against the property of the debtor or any part thereof.\" This requirement would make it impossible to include Jane McEwen within the meaning of the definition, as, at the time of the proposal, she was not the owner of the property mortgaged.\nThe reasoning of Masten J.A. is further strengthened by reference to the other sections of the Act, which assume throughout that the applicant must also be the debtor. An example of this may be found in sec. 11 (1), whereby\non the filing with the Official Receiver of a proposal, no creditor * * * shall have any remedy against the property or person of the debtor, or shall commence or continue any proceeding under the Bankruptcy Act, or any action, execution, or other proceeding for the recovery of a debt provable in bankruptcy * * * unless with leave of the court and on such terms as the court may impose.\nThere can be no debt \"provable in bankruptcy\" unless the applicant for the proposal is the debtor of the \"creditor, whether secured or unsecured.\"\nI fail to see how the respondent could validly be brought in a scheme of arrangement with Jane McEwen, who was not its personal debtor and who did not own the land upon which it held its mortgage. Jane McEwen was in no way the \"debtor\" of the respondent within the requirements of the Act, even after the introduction of the amendment of 1938 to section 2 (d).\nAnd section 19 of the Act does not improve the appellants' situation. It has already been referred to. It enacts that the\nAct shall not, without the concurrence of the creditor, apply in the case of any debt incurred after the first day of May, 1935.\nThe appellants rely on that section and claim that, as the mortgage debt was incurred by John McEwen on September 29th, 1919, and as John McEwen died August 26th, 1924, the Act applies to the debt so incurred.\nI do not overlook the respondent's contention that it cannot be so, since the will of John McEwen was probated only on August 13th, 1935, the transfer of the land to Jane McEwen made by her as personal representative to herself in personal capacity took place only on October 20th, 1936, and that, moreover, such a transfer was, in effect, a breach of trust which must be held ineffective, in so far as it may affect the interests and rights of the respondent. But it is sufficient to say that sec. 19 can have no other meaning than that the first day of May, 1935, therein mentioned, is referable and can be referable only to the date when the debt was incurred by the applicant farmer himself. The whole Act deals with the liabilities of the farmer who files a proposal with the Official Receiver and his \"present and prospective capability * * * to perform the obligations prescribed\", as well as \"the productive value of his farm.\" The \"composition, extension of time, or scheme of arrangement\" for which he is authorized to file a proposal, or the Board of Review may formulate a proposal, concern only the applicant farmer, whom the Dominion Parliament has declared essential, in the interest of the country, to retain on the land as an efficient producer (See preamble of the Act). It follows that \"the debt incurred\", referred to in sec. 19, is necessarily the debt personally incurred by the applicant and does not concern a debt which, though at present owing by the applicant farmer, towards the creditor, was incurred by a previous debtor (who may not have been a farmer) and at a date prior to the first day of May, 1935, as is the case here.\nAs a consequence of the foregoing, the point raised by the respondent that if the Act, and more particularly sec. 2 (d), should be construed otherwise than was contended by it, the Act would be unconstitutional, need not be considered.\nOn that point, we have heard argument on behalf of the Attorney-General of Canada; and it is sufficient to say that as, in my view, the Act and the amendments of 1938 ought to be construed as submitted by the respondent, the latter has no interest to raise the question of constitutionality and it need not be gone into in the present case.\nBut the fact remains that the respondent has succeeded to establish that the Act did not apply to Jane McEwen at the time when she filed her proposal, or at the time when the Board of Review pretended to formulate or to confirm a proposal in respect of her liabilities; and that, accordingly these proposals were made without authority and jurisdiction and they were invalid, as held by the majority of the Court of Appeal of Manitoba. There remains to discuss whether, as contended by the appellants, that Court had no power to deal with this matter on an application for certiorari, and it should have refused the motion for the issue of the writ.\nI do not think this Court ought to concern itself with the procedure set up by the King's Bench Act and the rules thereunder. This is essentially a matter of practice which, at least in the present case, should properly be left as settled by the Court of Appeal of Manitoba.\nThe same thing may be said of the point raised by the appellants that the respondent's application for certiorari was, in any event, barred by delay, prejudice and estoppel. This, to my mind, was a matter to be determined according to the discretion of the Court of Appeal. Moreover, where the subject of the discussion raises not only the question of the competency of the Official Receiver and of the Board of Review, but might involve as well the constitutional jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada, I do not think that, generally speaking, an objection based on delay, latches, or estoppel, could be held to deprive the courts of the power to inquire into the substantial points which are discussed in this appeal.\nThe fallacy of the appellants' contention is that the Official Receiver or the Board of Review were given the authority to pass upon these substantial questions. Starting from that erroneous premise, they asked the Court to hold that the Board of Review had made findings on these substantial questions, and, there being no appeal from the decisions of the Board, the findings so made must be held as conclusive and as thereby withdrawn from the supervisory authority of the provincial Supreme Court.\nBut, of course, a mere perusal of the Act shows that the Board of Review has been given no such authority. The Official Receiver or the Board, naturally, must proceed generally upon a prima facie case of jurisdiction being established, but that is vastly different from the suggestion that, in the exercise of their jurisdiction, the Official Receiver or the Board may determine the questions of law, as distinguished from the questions of pure fact (Reference concerning the Tariff Board of Canada)[6]. Of course, the status of a farmer, and whether he is able to meet his liabilities as they become due, and whether there exists between the interested parties the relation of debtor and creditor, are largely questions of fact; but whether these facts are covered by the Act, and whether they bring the matter within the meaning of the Act and under the jurisdiction of the Receiver and the Board are questions of law. The whole subject is one of mixed law and fact. Neither the Receiver, nor the Board, has been given by the Act the power to determine these questions in their legal aspect. The courts designated by the Act for that purpose are, in Quebec, the Superior Court and, in the other provinces, the County or District Court. The jurisdiction conferred on these courts by section 5 of the Act is stated to be \"a jurisdiction in bankruptcy\" and that wording implies a qualified jurisdiction. But such jurisdiction is sufficient to give to these courts the power to determine the status as a farmer of the applicant to the Official Receiver, as well as the other questions: Whether the farmer is unable to meet his liabilities as they become due and whether, for the purposes of the application of the Act, the relation of creditor and debtor exists between the interested parties.\nNowhere in the Act are the Official Receiver or the Board of Review given any such jurisdiction. And the existence of the status of farmer, or of his insolvency, or of the relation of debtor and creditor, is a condition precedent to the validity of the proceedings before the Official Receiver or before the Board; it is a prerequisite of their competency in the premises. Unless these conditions exist, the Official Receiver and the Board cannot enter into the matter at all. Further, the Receiver, or the Board, have not been given by the Act the power to decide these matters, they are specifically declared to be within the exclusive jurisdiction in bankruptcy of the courts named in section 5.\nIn this case, it was stated at bar, and it is apparent from the record, that these preliminary questions, which it was essential to have decided before the Receiver or the Board could acquire jurisdiction, were never brought before the County or District Court having territorial jurisdiction in Manitoba.\nUpon the return to the writ of certiorari, the Board of Review certified to the Court of Appeal the proposal it made as of October 29th, 1937, confirmed as originally formulated and declared to be binding upon all creditors of the so-called farmer debtor on October 5th, 1938, and filed in the County Court of Dauphin on October 8th, 1938. This was the only document returned by the Registrar of the Board.\nIt is true that, as shown by that proposal, the Board therein found \"the farmer entitled to the benefit of the Act,\" although it is not clear whether this may be taken as a finding that Jane McEwen was a farmer, or as assuming that she was a farmer and holding that she was otherwise entitled to the benefit of the Act. But, be that as it may, for the reasons above given, the exact meaning of the finding is immaterial. It is sufficient that it shows that the Board was treating Jane McEwen as a farmer entitled to invoke the Act and was proceeding to formulate a proposal as if the Act applied to her, notwithstanding the objections of the respondent clearly put before that body prior to the formulation of the proposal.\nThe document returned upon the writ and certified to by the Registrar of the Board of Review as being the proposal confirmed by the Board and intended to be binding upon the respondent discloses:\nThat the farmer's son, Robert McEwen, who is at present living and working on the farm, intends to remain there and finds that the farm is being efficiently operated.\nThis statement is strongly suggestive of the fact that Jane McEwen herself was not farming the land, but that her son was the farmer who, in accordance with the preamble of the Act, was to be retained on the land as efficient producer. The statement so made, together with the facts otherwise established and related in the early part of this judgment (not forgetting that the farm was leased to the son by the mortgagee) sufficiently show that the status of Jane McEwen as a farmer was disputable and of such a doubtful character as should have required a decision by the court competent to pass upon it.\nThe proposal further states:\n\"There appeared to be no unsecured creditors\"; and it mentions that\nthe taxes levied against the said land by the rural municipality of Dauphin have been paid to the 31st December, 1935; and that\nthe claim of International Harvester Company of Canada, Limited, having been incurred since the first day of May, 1935, shall not be affected by this proposal.\nThe only liability apparent on the face of the document is the respondent's mortgage there stated to have been \"given by John McEwen, now deceased, the farmer's late husband\". Nowhere is it stated that this mortgage has become the debt of Jane McEwen either through will, through transfer or in any other way. As there shewn, it is a debt of the estate of John McEwen.\nThe result is that the document itself does not show the existence of any debt owing by Jane McEwen. If that be so, there was no evidence before the Board of the alleged insolvency of Jane McEwen and, accordingly, nothing to indicate or even to suggest that she was unable to meet her liabilities, since there were none. Nor was there even a scintilla of evidence that the relation of debtor and creditor existed between Jane McEwen and the respondent.\nIt is clear, therefore, on the proposal itself, that none of the conditions essential and prerequisite to the existence of the jurisdiction of the Board were present in the case. These facts were still made clearer, if necessary, by the evidence put before the Court of Appeal of Manitoba in the affidavits filed by the parties.\nIt was objected by the appellants that the proposal, returned into court pursuant to the writ of certiorari, constituted the only and entire record before the court on the motion to quash, and that it was not open to the court to go behind the return and to consider extraneous material. It was argued before us that, by taking the affidavits into account, the Court of Appeal was, in point of fact, exercising an appellate jurisdiction which it could not do in certiorari proceedings.\nAlthough, in my view, the proposal itself is sufficient evidence of the lack of jurisdiction of the Board, more particularly if it is coupled with the admission at bar that the respondent's objections were never submitted to the County Court, it may be in order to mention that it is not strictly correct to say that a court, acting on certiorari in the exercise of its supervisory authority, should not be allowed to inquire into the actual facts, in order to determine the question of the jurisdiction of an inferior tribunal (9 Halsbury, p. 898, sec. 1514, notes (p) and (q); Regina v. Bolton[7]).\nThe subject was fully considered in Rex v. Nat Bell Liquors Limited[8]. In that case, Lord Sumner, delivering the judgment of their Lordships of the Privy Council, said (p. 153):\nIn Reg. v. Bolton7, Lord Denman, in a well-known passage, says: \"The case to be supposed is one * * * in which the Legislature has trusted the original, it may be (as here) the final, jurisdiction on the merits to the magistrates below; in which this Court has no jurisdiction as to the merits either originally or on appeal. All that we can then do * * * is to see that the case was one within their jurisdiction, and that their proceedings on the face of them are regular and according to law * * * where the charge laid before the magistrate, as stated in the information, does not amount in law to the offence over which the statute gives him jurisdiction, his finding the party guilty by his conviction in the very terms of the statute would not avail to give him jurisdiction; the conviction would be bad on the face of the proceedings, all being returned before us. Or if, the charge being really insufficient, he had mis-stated it in drawing up the proceedings, so that they would appear to be regular, it would be clearly competent to the defendant to show to us by affidavits what the real charge was, and, that appearing to have been insufficient, we would quash the conviction; * * * But, as in this latest case, we cannot get at the want of jurisdiction but by affidavits, of necessity we must receive them. It will be observed, however, that here we receive them, not to show that the magistrate has come to a wrong conclusion, but that he never ought to have begun the inquiry * * *\nAt page 154:\nThe law laid down in Reg. v. Bolton7 has never since been seriously disputed in England.\nAt page 160:\nWhen it is contended that there are grounds for holding that a decision has been given without jurisdiction, this can only be made apparent on new evidence brought ad hoc before the Superior Court. How is it ever to appear within the four corners of the record that the members of the inferior court were unqualified, or were biased, or were interested in the subject-matter?\nThe hearing of the Board as a result of which the proposal was formulated was held ex parte, for the respondent did not appear, and there were no creditors present. The consequence was that the Board assumed the reality of the preliminary questions relating to its jurisdiction and, in the result, it established its jurisdiction, or took it for granted, by proceeding upon assumed facts. But, in the words of Lord Summer, \"the reality of that assumption having been inquired into (in the Court of Appeal) on affidavit as to the facts, since questions going to the jurisdiction of the (Board) must, in case of need, be inquired into, and it having been found that in fact (Jane McEwen was not a farmer, was not insolvent and was not the debtor of the respondent), the order was rightly quashed\" (Nat Bell case[9])., Further to quote Lord Sumner (p. 158):\nWhile the decision (of the Board) is final, if jurisdiction is established, the decision that its jurisdiction is established is open to examination on certiorari by a superior court.\nColeridge, J., delivering the judgment of the Court in Bunbury v. Fuller[10], stated the rule thus:\nNo court of limited jurisdiction can give itself jurisdiction by a wrong decision on a point collateral to the merits of the case upon which the limit to its jurisdiction depends; and however its decision may be final on all particulars making up together that subject-matter which, if true, is within its jurisdiction, and however necessary in many cases it may be for it to make a preliminary inquiry whether some collateral matter be or be not within the limits, yet upon this preliminary question, its decision must always be open to inquiry in the superior court.\nUpon the authority of those cases, I think it must be decided that the preliminary questions raised by the respondent were of such a nature that, in an ordinary case, they would properly give rise to an inquiry on certiorari by a superior court and that, for the purposes of that inquiry, the facts bearing on the question of jurisdiction could be put before that court by means of affidavits (The Security Export Company v. Hetherington[11]).\nThe judgment of this Court in the Hetherington case11 was reversed on the ground that the proceeding there in question was not judicial, but merely administrative; but the learned Law Lords fully endorsed the exposition, there made by my Lord the present Chief Justice, of the law pertaining to certiorari[12].\nSince the enactment of The Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, procedure by way of certiorari in respect of proposals under the Act has been held to be available in many cases: Re Ratz (Manitoba Court of Appeal[13], Re Hawkins (Manitoba Court of Appeal)[14], Re Hudson's Bay (Alberta)[15], Cr\u00e9dit Fonder v. Board of Review (Saskatchewan Court of Appeal)[16], Re Drewry (Saskatchewan Court of Appeal)[17]. See also The Queen v. Justice of Surrey[18] and The King v. Stafford Justices[19]. Short & Mellor, 2nd Ed., p. 48.\nBut there was a special reason in this case why the writ of certiorari should be resorted to. It appears by the document certified by the Registrar of the Board of Review upon the return to the writ, that the proposal, as formulated by the Board, was confirmed by the latter and declared to be binding upon all creditors of the so-called farmer debtor on October 5th, 1938, and that it was \"filed in the County Court of Dauphin, on the 8th day of Oct. 1938.\" This filing in the court concluded the whole matter, so far as the operation of the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act was concerned. Nothing remained to be done under it. The respondent Board of Review became functus officio as soon as it had confirmed the proposal formulated by it and such proposal was transmitted to the Official Receiver, to be filed by him in the court under Rule 23 of the Rules and Regulations made under the Act. The Official Receiver did file the proposal in court on October 8th, 1938, as appears on the face of the document returned upon the certiorari. There is no longer, under the Act, any provision that the proposal so filed should be approved by the court. Upon it being filed, it became immediately \"binding upon all the creditors and the debtor\" (subs. 6 of s. 12), and, in particular, upon the respondent, unless it elected to contest the validity of the same, so as to be relieved of the arrangement made by the Board.\nAs a consequence, the jurisdiction in bankruptcy given by s. 5 of the Act to the County Court was exhausted; and, assuming that jurisdiction was exclusive while the Act was operating, clearly it could no longer stand in the way of the supervisory authority of the Court of Appeal after the Act had accomplished its purpose and its effect (Prudential Ins. Co. v. Berg.[20]. In the circumstances of this case, certiorari was a remedy open to the respondent.\nThe latter might also have continued its proceedings in the Court of King's Bench in respect of its mortgage account claim which, as we were told, is still pending, although the statement of defence in that action pleaded The Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act and alleged that the confirmation and filing in court of the proposal was a bar to the respondent's action.\nThe respondent has refused consistently to recognize the jurisdiction of the Board of Review, it has never acquiesced in it, and it could validly invoke the authority of a superior court (in this case, the Court of Appeal of Manitoba) to question the jurisdiction of the Board and to have the Court inquire whether the conditions precedent and prerequisite to the Board's competency existed in this matter.\nI have, therefore, come to the conclusion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs. There should be no costs to the Attorney-General of Canada.\nDavis, J. (dissenting):\u2014The Board of Review for the province of Manitoba under The Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, 1934, and amendments, assumed to reduce the amount of the respondent company's mortgage on, what may for convenience be called, the McEwen farm in Manitoba. The mortgage had been on the property since October, 1919; nothing has been paid on the principal amount of $4,000; and arrears of interest on the 1st of November, 1936, amounted to $2,332.15, which indicates that the interest on the mortgage could not have been paid for many years. No proceedings appear to have been taken at any time by the respondent either to recover the money debt or to enforce the security. John McEwen, who had made the mortgage in 1919, remained the owner of the farm until his death on the 26th of August, 1934. By his will he devised and bequeathed all his property, real and personal, to his wife, Jane McEwen, and appointed her the sole executrix of the will. The widow and a son appear to have continued to reside on and work the farm following upon the death of the husband and father. Then, on July 31st, 1936, Mrs. McEwen sought relief under the provisions of The Farmers' Creditors Arrangement, Act, 1934, by lodging with the Official Receiver for Dauphin Judicial District a proposal under the statute for a composition, extension or scheme of arrangement. With the proposal was the required statement of affairs in which Mrs. McEwen said that her principal occupation was farming; that she was unable to meet her liabilities as they became due; and she gave as the amounts of claims of creditors the respondent's mortgage at $6,000 and arrears of taxes on the farm of $170. She was then, the statement said, 76 years old; had 170 acres under cultivation; the causes of her financial difficulties were, \"Debt too heavy. Failure of crops and low prices.\"\nThe proceedings in connection with this proposal moved rather slowly. It was not until March 31st, 1937, that the Board of Review for Manitoba constituted under The Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act heard the matter, and it was not until October 29th, 1937, that the Board formulated, what is called under the statute, its proposal wherein it reduced the amount owing on the respondent's mortgage to $2,800 as at the 1st of January, 1937, including principal and interest, and the rate of interest (which had originally been 7 per cent per annum) from the said date was reduced to 6 per cent per annum; and special terms were imposed for the repayment of the reduced principal amount in instalments.\nI interject in the narrative here the statement that the proceedings out of which this appeal comes to this Court were certiorari proceedings that were not commenced until September 17th, 1940, on which date the respondent served notice of motion upon the Registrar of the Board of Review and upon the executors of Jane McEwen (she having died in the meantime on the 27th of March, 1940) and upon the son, Robert James McEwen, to whom his mother had devised the property by her will and who was at the time in occupation of the farm. The notice of motion was made direct to the Court of Appeal for Manitoba (in accordance with the practice in that province)\nfor an order that a writ of certiorari do issue out of this Honourable Court for the return into this Court of the proposal made by the Board of Review under \"The Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act,\" and dated the 29th day of October, 1937, which said proposal purports to have been made binding by the filing of the same in the County Court of Dauphin, in order that the said proposal, or those portions contained in paragraphs numbered 1, 2, 3 and 4 thereof, may be quashed, and for such further or other order as to this Honourable Court may seem proper.\nThe grounds set forth in the notice of motion were that the Board of Review in making the said proposal acted without jurisdiction or in excess of jurisdiction; that Jane McEwen was not a farmer within the meaning of the statute and that she was not at the time of her application the owner of the property; and that she was not indebted to the respondent in respect of the said mortgage, never having assumed or undertaken to pay the debt secured by the said mortgage or to perform any of the covenants therein contained.\nThe Court of Appeal reviewed the matter at large, granted the writ and quashed the proposal made by the Board of Review, Dennistoun, J.A. dissenting, which meant that the reduction of the amount of the mortgage and the new terms of repayment were nullified. From that judgment the proceedings have come to this Court by way of special leave granted by the Court of Appeal. All phases of the matter were discussed at considerable length before us. Counsel for the respondent raised many objections to the whole course of proceedings under The Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, including an attack upon the constitutional validity of certain amendments to the Act that were made by Parliament in 1938. Some of the objections raised are undoubtedly formidable objections. But I am satisfied that the respondent misconceived its proper remedy and that in the special circumstances of this case the application for the issue of a writ of certiorari should have been refused. It may be fortunate for the respondent that an action it commenced in the courts of Manitoba many months prior to its commencement of these certiorari proceedings (to which action I shall later refer) is still pending. In that action the respondent itself put in issue the alleged invalidity of the proposal under The Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act and the alleged lack of jurisdiction in the Board of Review to deal with the matter under the statute.\nI return now to the first step that was taken by Mrs. McEwen under the statute, i.e., the lodging with the Official Receiver (having jurisdiction in the county or district in which Mrs. McEwen resided) of a composition, extension or scheme of arrangement. That was, as I said before, July 31st, 1936. The effect of that first step was to put the subject matter of the proposal into the exclusive jurisdiction, subject to appeal, of the County Court of Dauphin, which is admitted to be the judicial district where Mrs. McEwen resided and the farm was located. The exclusive jurisdiction of the County Court of Dauphin in the matter, subject to the right of appeal provided by the statute, is to me the fundamental and most important fact in considering the certiorari proceedings which have come before us. The Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act is part of the bankruptcy and insolvency legislation of the Parliament of Canada and the Act was made to be read and construed as one with The Bankruptcy Act. Sec. 2 (2). For the purposes of The Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, Parliament saw fit to designate the local courts, the County or District Courts (except in the province of Quebec), to have jurisdiction in respect of the statutory means provided whereby compromises or rearrangements might be effected of debts of farmers who were unable to pay (the recital in the Act). The following is the provision of the statute which gave the County Court of Dauphin exclusive jurisdiction, subject to appeal:\nSec. 5. (1) In the case of an assignment, petition or proposal, in the province of Quebec, the Superior Court of the judicial district where the farmer resides, and in other provinces, the county or district court, shall have exclusive jurisdiction in bankruptcy subject to appeal as provided in section one hundred and seventy-four of the Bankruptcy Act.\nSection 7 enacts that a proposal may provide for a compromise or an extension of time or a scheme of arrangement in relation to a debt owing to a secured creditor, or in relation to a debt owing to a person who has acquired movable or immovable property subject to a right of redemption, but in that event the concurrence of the secured creditor or such person, shall be required, except in the case of a proposal formulated and confirmed by the Board of Review. I am not forgetting that one of the strongest points made by counsel for the respondent is that the respondent was not a secured creditor of Mrs. McEwen because she was not its debtor. But leaving that question aside for the moment, it is important, I think, to observe that Parliament gave to the Board of Review a right to work out a proposal which might involve secured creditors, even in the absence of their concurrence.\nThe Board of Review is under the statute essentially an administrative body. A proposal first goes to the Official Receiver having jurisdiction in the locality and if at a meeting of creditors called by him the proposal or some modification of it is not approved by the creditors, the Official Receiver reports this fact to the Board of Review, and the Board then shall, at the written request of a creditor or of the debtor, endeavour to formulate an acceptable proposal to be submitted to the creditors and the debtor, and the Board shall consider representations on the part of those interested. Sec. 12 (4). If any such proposal formulated by the Board is approved by the creditors and the debtor, it shall be filed in the court and shall be binding on the debtor and all the creditors. Sec. 12 (5). But if the creditors or the debtor decline to approve the proposal so formulated, the Board may nevertheless confirm such proposal, either as formulated or as amended by the Board, in which case it shall be filed in the court (i.e., again the County Court) and shall be binding upon all the creditors and the debtor as in the case of a proposal duly accepted by the creditors and approved by the Court. Sec. 12 (6).\nThe proposal formulated and confirmed by the Board of Review was filed in the County Court of Dauphin October 8th, 1938. I think it obvious that the Board must have withheld the filing of the document, which was dated October 29th, 1937, because of its own doubt as to whether or not the Act applied to the case of a mortgage security which, while it lay as a charge against the farmer's lands, was not a debt which the farmer himself had incurred or had undertaken to assume and pay, until the 1938 amendments to the statute, which became effective July 1st, 1938, attempted at least to bring this sort of claim within the ambit of the statute.\nIn considering whether or not certiorari proceedings against the Board became available on the notice of motion that was not made until September 17th, 1940, it is important to observe that as early as August 5th, 1936, when the respondent was notified by the Official Receiver of the proposal he had received from Mrs. McEwen, the respondent took the position in a letter to the Official Receiver of that date, and has adhered to the position consistently throughout, that it was not in any way affected by the proposal. But the respondent at no time appeared or took any proceedings, either before the Official Receiver or before the Board of Review or in the County Court of Dauphin. Holding consistently to its position that Mrs. McEwen was not its debtor and that it was not a secured creditor, the respondent deliberately ignored, as it had a perfect right to do at its own risk, the proceedings under The Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, A very convenient and speedy remedy was available to the respondent when it got notice in August, 1936, that Mrs. McEwen had filed an application with the Official Receiver. It could have moved at once in the County Court of Dauphin, which in my view had exclusive jurisdiction, subject to appeal, to have the proposal set aside upon any of the grounds alleged by the respondent, that is, that Mrs. McEwen was not a farmer within the meaning of the statute, that she was not the owner of the lands and that she was not entitled to the benefit of the Act, or to stay proceedings or to have it determined that in any event the respondent was not a creditor of the applicant and was not affected by the proposal or proceedings under the statute. I have not the slightest doubt that the County judge would have entertained any such application and would have dealt with the matter at the time in a speedy and inexpensive manner. A statutory right to appeal from any decision that he might give was available. It may be that a declaratory action might have been brought in the Court of King's Bench to determine the rights of the parties and to grant relief by injunction or otherwise, though I do not find it necessary to pass upon that as an available remedy. The respondent did, however, commence an action in the Court of King's Bench on December 9th, 1939, (more than three years after Mrs. McEwen sought relief under the statute and more than a year after the Board of Review's proposal had been filed in the County Court of Dauphin), against Mrs. McEwen as executrix under the will of her deceased husband and against herself personally, for the administration of the estate of John McEwen and to have the lands ordered to be sold, subject to the mortgage, to satisfy the debts. In the statement of claim the respondent alleged that there was then owing to it under the mortgage the sum of $7,102 and that it had security for a portion of the said debt, namely, the sum of $2,612:15, but had no security for the balance, being the sum of $4,489.85. The important point is that in that action, in reply to a demand for particulars, the respondent as plaintiff in the action stated that the figure it had given for the security on the loan was the amount fixed by the Board of Review under The Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, and in reply to the statement of defence, set up that the Board of Review\nwas without power or jurisdiction to compromise, reduce or in any way deal with the debt of the deceased or his estate\nunder the mortgage, and, in the alternative, that\nif the said proposal does purport to compromise, reduce or deal with the said debt, such proposal was made without power or jurisdiction and is void and of no effect.\nThat reply was delivered January 16th, 1940. No further step appears to have been taken by the respondent in that action and it was admitted that the action is still pending in the Court of King's Bench for Manitoba. Eight months after the respondent put in issue in that action the alleged invalidity of the proposal and the alleged want of jurisdiction of the Board of Review, it commenced these certiorari proceedings in the Court of Appeal for Manitoba against the Board, seeking an order that the proposal of the Board be quashed. The Board had become functus so far as this matter was concerned when it filed its proposal in the County Court of Dauphin in October, 1938. The proposal rested thereafter in the said County Court, which had exclusive jurisdiction in the matter, subject to the right of appeal.\nFurther, it is to be observed that sec. 11 (3) of the statute provides that no proposal shall be received in the province of Manitoba later than the 30th day of June, 1939. That means in this case that if the proposal is quashed, no new proposal can now be made by the owner of the farm to gain the advantage of the provisions of the statute. Notwithstanding that the original proposal was brought to the notice of the respondent by the Official Receiver as early as August, 1936, the respondent did not institute these proceedings by way of certiorari until September, 1940.\nThe Court of Appeal reviewed the evidence submitted to it as if the proceedings were by way of an appeal from the Board of Review, examining the merits of the case to the extent of even admitting particulars of fire insurance policies on the buildings and contents in an effort on the part of the respondent to show that the valuation of the applicant to the Board had been an undervaluation. Further, the confirmation and filing of the Board's proposal in the County Court made that proposal, by force of the statute (sec. 12 (6)), \"binding upon all the creditors and the debtor\" and had the effect of a judgment of that Court. There appears to be no reported decision in which certiorari has been granted to quash the judgments of inferior courts of civil jurisdiction. Halsbury, 2nd ed., Vol. IX, page 844, para. 1431, note (q).\nIn view of all the facts and circumstances of the matter, I am of the opinion that the conduct of the respondent throughout has been such as to disentitle it to relief in certiorari proceedings. To dismiss this appeal with costs is in my opinion, with great respect to those with whom I differ, to put the appellants the Board of Review, the Registrar, the executors of Mrs. McEwen and her son, Robert James McEwen, to the burden of what appear to me to be excessive and unnecessary costs of litigation.\nThe application for the writ ought, in my opinion, to have been dismissed and I should therefore allow the appeal and direct that the order be refused, with costs to the appellants throughout.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants\u2014The Board of Review and the Registrar: Johnson & Bergman.\nSolicitors for the appellants: R.

Act\u2014Order in council\u2014\"Scheme \" to regulate marketing of milk\u2014Constitution of Lower Mainland Dairy Products Board\u2014Milk Clearing House Limited incorporated as a company to act as sole \" agency\"\u2014Orders of Board\u2014Providing for equalization of return to milk producers\u2014Validity of orders\u2014Obnoxious or exceeding delegated powers\u2014Indirect taxation\u2014Extrinsic evidence to prove intent or effect of orders\u2014Admissibility\u2014Natural Products Marketing (B.C.) Act, R.S.B.C., 1936, c. 165.\nUnder the provisions of the Natural Products Marketing (B.C.) Act, R.S.B.C., 1936, c. 165 the Lieutenant-Governor in Council passed an order in council creating a \" scheme \" to regulate the dairy business within a specified territory in British Columbia and constituted the appellant Board to administer the scheme, the appellants Williams and Barrow and the defendant Kilby being appointed as its members. The appellant The Milk Clearing House Limited was incorporated and an order of the Board designated that company as the sole \"agency\" through which the milk produced in that area was to be marketed. The appellant Board also passed other orders for the purpose of carrying out the scheme. Milk producers were prohibited from selling their milk otherwise than to this agency and the latter was given the exclusive right to sell milk to dairies and manufacturers. The Milk Clearing House was receiving the total receipts from the sale of the milk, and these receipts, less expenses, were divided amongst the producers at a certain period, called the settlement period: the amounts thus paid being based on a system of \"quotas.\" A certain fixed percentage of the milk purchased by the Milk Clearing House from each producer was treated as having been sold in the \"fluid-milk market\" and the remainder was treated as having been sold in the lower-priced \"manufactured-milk market,\" quite irrespective of where each producer's milk had actually been sold and without regard to the quantity of milk sold by each individual producer on the \"fluid-milk\" market: the amount being thus paid to the producers on the basis of an equalized price. The trial judge held that the orders were ultra vires and his judgment was affirmed by the appellate court.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from (56 B.C.R. 103), that the impugned orders of the appellant Board cannot stand, as they go beyond the limits of the powers granted to the Board by the Act.\nPer the Chief Justice and Davis and Hudson JJ.:\u2014There was sufficient evidence, (and it was so found by the trial judge whose findings were approved by a majority of the Court of Appeal) to support the view that the purpose and effect of the impugned orders was to enable the appellant Board, in co-operation with its agent the Milk Clearing House, to equalize prices as between producers who have a market for their milk in the more advantageous fluid milk market and producers whose milk is not sold in the fluid milk market but must be sold in the manufacturers market at a lower price; and to accomplish this by abstracting from the proceeds of the sales of the former class in the fluid milk market a sufficient part of the returns from the sale of their milk to enable the Board, by handing that part over to the other producers, to bring the several rates of return for the two classes into a state of equality. Such an administrative body as the appellant Board in exercising its statutory powers\u2014powers powers affecting the rights and interests of private individuals\u2014is under an obligation not only to observe the limits of its powers and to act conformably to the procedure laid down; it is under a strict duty to use its powers in good faith for the purposes for which they are given. (The Municipal Council of Sydney v. Campbell ([1925] A.C. 338) and Campbell v. Village of Lanark (20 O.A.R. 372)). The impugned orders are obnoxious to this principle in the purpose disclosed by the orders themselves and the evidence adduced to accomplish indirectly what the King in Council has adjudged they cannot lawfully do directly, namely, by exacting monetary contributions from milk producers by a method constituting indirect taxation. Lower Mainland Dairy Products Sales Adjustment Committee v. Crystal Dairy Limited ([1933] A.C. 168, at 176).\nPer Rinfret, Crocket and Taschereau JJ.\u2014The orders formulated by the appellant Board go beyond the authority granted by the Act, and the appeal could be dismissed on the ground that the Board has exceeded its delegated powers. But these orders could also be declared illegal on the further ground that the Board has attempted to do something upon which the legislature itself could not legislate and this is to impose indirect taxation. There is no substantial difference between the consequences that flow from the impugned orders and the results obtained under the Dairy Products Sales Adjustment Act of 1929, which had been declared ultra vires the province. Lower Mainland Dairy Products Sales Adjustment Committee v. Crystal Dairy Limited ([1933] A.C. 168).\nHeld, also, that the extrinsic evidence given at the trial to show the intent and effect of the orders was admissible. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia [1], affirming the judgment of the trial judge, D. A. McDonald J. [2] and maintaining the respondent's action.\nThe action was for a declaration that certain orders of the appellant Board were ultra vires and not binding on the respondents, who are milk producers, for an injunction restraining the Board from taking steps to compel the respondents to comply with the provisions of these orders; for an injunction restraining the appellant Milk Clearing House Limited from acting as the designated agency pursuant to these orders; for a declaration that the milk marketing scheme of the Lower Mainland of British Columbia, established by order in council, was ultra vires and for an injunction restraining the appellant Board from exercising any of the powers purporting to have been invested in it by that scheme. By the Natural Products Marketing (B.C.) Act, the Lieutenant-Governor in Council was empowered to establish marketing boards and to inaugurate schemes for the regulation of marketing of natural products in the province. The appellant Board was so constituted with extensive powers as set out in the scheme. Under the powers so conferred, the Board enacted the orders attacked in this action in August, 1939. On the trial, it was held that the orders complained of were ultra vires the appellant Board and the respondents were granted the relief sought. This judgment was affirmed by a majority of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia.\nC. H. Locke K.C. for the appellants.\nJ. W. deB. Farris K.C. and John Farris for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and of Davis and Hudson JJ. was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice\u2014The learned trial judge in his reasons for judgment says:\u2014\nThe gravamen of the plaintiffs' complaint in the present action is that in order to escape the results of the decision in the Crystal Dairy case [3] the defendant Board adopted a colourable scheme whereby to make it appear that milk was actually being sold by the producers to the defendant Milk Clearing House Limited and resold by the Clearing House to the distributors at prices fixed by the Board whereas there was in fact intended to be no sale at all. The contention is that the Clearing House was intended to operate as a mere conduit pipe, an instrument whereby the price to be paid to producers of milk should be equalized so that in effect the proceeds of milk produced by producer A should in certain proportions be taken from him and handed over to producer B, as had been in effect the practice under the earlier scheme.\nThe plaintiffs are met in limine with the objection that, admitting that the statute is intra vires and the scheme set up by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council under the statute is intra vires and the orders issued by the Board are plain on their face, it is not open to the courts to make any enquiry as to the motives which actuated the members of the Board in passing the orders which are now attacked.\n***\nThe members of the Board who passed these orders knew that the agency theretofore existing would be attacked as being merely an agency formed for the purpose of equalizing prices and, hence, subject to being impugned under the decision in the Crystal Dairy case [4]. With a view to escaping from that attack the Board was instrumental in having the defendant Milk Clearing House Limited incorporated under the Companies Act. It is pretended that it was so incorporated as an ordinary commercial concern whose object is to buy in the cheapest market and sell in the dearest market and in the ordinary course of trade to make a profit for its shareholders. I think the more one examines the evidence the more he must become convinced that this is a mere sham. I do not believe it was ever intended that the Clearing House should make any profit and if there were any doubt on this one needs only to examine the evidence of Mr. Sherwood, one of the directors of the company.\nIf, as I think the real purpose and effect of the impugned orders are, as alleged in paragraph 25 of the statement of claim, \"to take from the producer supplying the fluid market a portion of his real returns and to contribute the same to other producers for the purpose of equalization (and that) the so-called sales and resales to and by the agency so-called are colourable,\" then I am satisfied the orders cannot stand.\nThe learned trial judge's findings were approved by the majority of the Court of Appeal.\nThere was sufficient evidence to support the view that the purpose and effect of the impugned orders was to enable the Board, in co-operation with its agent the Clearing House, to equalize prices as between producers who have a market for their milk in the more advantageous fluid milk market and producers whose milk is not sold in the fluid milk market but must be sold in the manufacturers market at a lower price; and to accomplish this by abstracting from the proceeds of the sales of the former class in the fluid milk market a sufficient part of the returns from the sale of their milk to enable the Board, by handing that part over to the other producers, to bring the several rates of return for the two classes into a state of equality.\nMr. Locke, in his able argument, did not succeed in convincing me that the Board is entitled to employ its powers respecting marketing and the regulation of prices to do what it has attempted.\nSuch an administrative body as the Board in exercising its statutory powers\u2014powers affecting the rights and interests of private individuals\u2014is under an obligation not only to observe the limits of its powers and to act conformably to the procedure laid down; it is under a strict duty to use its powers in good faith for the purposes for which they are given. The application of this principle is illustrated in the judgments in the House of Lords in The Municipal Council of Sydney v. Campbell [5], and in Campbell v. Village of Lanark [6]. The impugned orders are obnoxious to this principle in the purpose disclosed by the orders themselves and the evidence adduced to accomplish indirectly what the King in Council has adjudged they cannot lawfully do directly, namely, by xacting monetary contributions from milk producers by a method constituting indirect taxation. Lower Mainland Dairy Products Sales Adjustment Committee v. Crystal Dairy Limited [7].\nIn view of some of the arguments advanced in the factums and elsewhere I think it is wise perhaps to call attention to the wide difference between a provincial legislature which exercises powers of legislation in the strict sense, the Crown being a party to its enactments, and an administrative body exercising powers of administration under statutory authority, such as the appellant Board.\nThe appeal will be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Rinfret, Crocket and Taschereau JJ. was delivered by\nTaschereau J.\u2014In their statement of claim, the plaintiffs-respondents attack the validity of Orders nos. 10, 12, 13, 14 and 15 formulated by the Lower Mainland Dairy Products Board, which has been established under the authority of the Natural Products Marketing Act (Ch. 165, R.S.B.C., 1936), and submit that they are ultra vires of the Board. They also ask that the scheme created by Order in Council be declared illegal, and pray for an injunction restraining all the defendants from exercising any of the powers purported to have been invested in them.\nMr. Justice D. A. McDonald of the Supreme Court of British Columbia declared that Orders 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 were ultra vires, ordered that the defendant Milk Clearing House Limited be restrained from acting as the agency pursuant to these Orders, and that the Board, and its members Williams and Barrow be also restrained from taking any steps to compel the plaintiffs to comply with the provisions of the Orders. The court further held that the action against the defendant Kilby, one of the members of the Board, and the claim of the plaintiffs for a declaration that the Milk Marketing scheme is ultra vires, should be dismissed. The defendants appealed from this judgment, and the plaintiffs cross-appealed claiming that the judgment should be varied by declaring that the Milk Marketing scheme is ultra vires. The Court of Appeal for British Columbia (Chief Justice MacDonald dissenting) dismissed the main appeal and the cross-appeal with costs. As there has been no cross-appeal here, this Court is concerned only with the validity of the Orders, and the injunction restraining the Board, the Milk Clearing House and the defendants Williams and Barrow, from taking any steps or proceedings to compel the plaintiffs to comply with the Orders.\nThe plaintiffs, except W. A. Hayward and Charles Hawthorne who produce milk for sale, are engaged in distributing milk and cream, and in carrying on a general dairy business in the cities of Vancouver and of New Westminster. In that region of the province of British Columbia there are two different markets for milk. One is called the Fluid Milk Market, where the milk is used in fluid form, and the second is known as the Manufacturers Market, where the milk is used for the manufacture of ice-cream, butter, condensed milk, etc. There is an excess of milk produced in that area over the requirements of the Fluid Milk Market, and some dairy farmers, therefore, in order to avoid a congestion of the Fluid Milk Market, are necessarily obliged to market a portion of their milk in the form of manufactured products at world market prices, which are lower than the price obtained for milk in fluid form. A group of farmers called the Independent Farmers have sold in the past much more of their milk proportionally on the Fluid Market than another group of farmers of the Fraser Valley Milk Producers Association. This situation has existed for many years, and in order to meet the demand of the farmers the Legislature passed in 1929 the Dairy Products Sales Adjustment Act, which required all dairy farmers and distributors to make returns to the Committee of Adjustments of all milk sold and bought and the prices paid. This Committee has power to ascertain the price during each month of milk sold on both markets, and had also the power to spread the difference between the two sums, so that each dairy farmer would receive a uniform price for his milk per pound butterfat, regardless of the market in which the commodity was sold. The farmer receiving more than the ascertained equalized price was required to pay to the Committee an amount sufficient to reduce his return to the equalized price, and the Committee would then pay from the sum so received an amount sufficient to bring up to the same level the prices received by the vendors in the Manufacturers' Market.\nThis legislation was submitted to the Supreme Court of British Columbia[8], and Mr. Justice Murphy before whom the case was tried, found that this adjustment by the Committee constituted a tax on one farmer and a bonus to the other. He also came to the conclusion that this tax, and the levy collected to pay certain expenses was indirect taxation, not within the legislative competence of the Province. This judgment was upheld by the Court of Appeal of British Columbia [9] and also by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (Lower Mainland Dairy Products Sales Adjustment Committee v. Crystal Dairy Limited [10].\nIn view of this decision of the Privy Council declaring the Act of 1929 ultra vires, the Legislature of British Columbia enacted in 1934 (amended in 1936) the Natural Products Marketing British Columbia Act. This law purported to provide for the control and regulation in any or all respects of the transportation, packing, storage and marketing of natural products within the province; and marketing was defined as buying and selling, for sale or storage; and natural products included any product of agriculture, or of the forest, sea, lake, or river and any article of food or drink wholly or partly manufactured or derived from any such product. This definition clearly included milk.\nUnder paragraph 2 of section 4 of the Act, the Lieutenant-Governor in Council was empowered to establish, amend and revoke schemes for the control and regulation within the province of any natural products, and was also authorized to constitute marketing boards to administer such schemes. The validity of this legislation was again contested before the courts, and in 1938 the Judicial Committee[11] held that this legislation was intra vires and, consequently, the impugned statute was held to be within the legislative powers of the province of British Columbia.\nOn the 31st of March, 1939, an Order in Council was passed providing a scheme to regulate the transportation and marketing of milk and certain milk products in the Lower Mainland of the province of British Columbia. As a consequence of this Order in Council, the Lower Mainland Dairy Products Board was established and the three defendants Messrs. Williams, Barrow and Kilby were appointed members of that Board. The defendant the Lower Mainland Dairy Products Board passed certain Orders nos. 1 to 9. Later, Orders 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 were repealed, and Orders nos. 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 were passed and, in one of these Orders, one of the defendants the Milk Clearing House Limited, a company incorporated under the laws of British Columbia, was appointed sole agency through which all the milk produced in the Lower Mainland area is to be marketed. Although a certain price to be paid to the farmers per pound butterfat has been determined by the Board, the payment is to be made only after going through quite complicated proceedings. All dairy farmers in the area are prohibited from selling their milk to any one but a single agency which is the appellant, the Milk Clearing House Limited, and which is also given sole power to sell to dairies and manufacturers. The Milk Clearing House Limited receives the total receipts from the sale of the milk, and at a certain period, which is called the settlement period, divides amongst the producers these receipts less expenses. This payment to the producers, however, is not made in the usual way, but each farmer has a base, which is the quantity of butterfat determined from the average daily weight and butterfat test of eligible milk marketed in cans by a producer, during the first three and last three calendar months of the previous calendar year, and during which period the producer has been a consistent marketer of eligible milk in cans. The dairy farmer then receives an amount for his fluid milk determined by his base in proportion to the total bases. This is called his quota. Quota in other words is\nthe percentage of a producer's base as all milk marketed by the Clearing House for the Fluid Milk Market in cans during such settlement period is of the total of all bases for milk marketed in cans.\nIf a farmer has a base of 1,000 pounds and if the total bases are 100,000 pounds, and if the total sales by the agent amount only to 50,000 pounds butterfat of fluid milk, which is 50 per cent of the milk available, then this farmer will be paid only for 50 per cent of what he sold, which is 500 pounds. This 50 per cent or 500 pounds is the quota of this farmer. Assuming now that, only 400 pounds of another producer's milk, who has also a base of 1,000 pounds, has been sold on the Fluid Market, he would nevertheless on account of his base and quota be paid for 500 pounds. For the amount of milk sold in excess to the Clearing House, these dairy farmers receive the manufacturers' price which is substantially lower. Under the Act of 1929 which was declared ultra vires of the British Columbia Legislature in the Crystal case[12], equalization was obtained by allowing the farmer to receive the full amount of the price of his commodity, and compelling him to pay to the Board such portion as would reduce his balance to the equalized price. The amount paid by the farmer was declared to be an indirect tax, and, therefore, ultra vires.\nUnder the new scheme the proceeds of the sale are kept by the agent but the amount that the farmer vendor is to receive is determined only at the end of the month when the returns of the dairies are in. From that total amount which the agent receives, each month the expenses incurred are deducted and the balance is paid to the farmers on the basis of an equalized price, and without regard to the quantity of milk sold by each individual farmer on the Fluid Market.\nIt seems plain that the orders go beyond the authority granted by the Act and that the appeal could be dismissed on the ground that the Board has exceeded its delegated powers. But, it has gone a step further in the field of illegality, and has attempted to do something upon which the legislature itself could not legislate, and this is to impose indirect taxation. For I fail to see any substantial difference between the results obtained under the Act of 1929, and the consequences that flow from the impugned orders.\nIn the Crystal case [13] the farmer had to reimburse a portion of what he had received for the benefit of another one, and under the new scheme, a part of the money to which he is entitled is intercepted and paid to one of his less fortunate competitors. Both schemes have indeed the same object which is to effect equalization by two different methods in form, but similar in substance. As in the Crystal case [14], the amount of which the farmer is deprived is a tax. These adjustments are compulsorily imposed by a statutory committee which is a public authority, are enforceable by law and imposed for public purposes. I do not think that this Clearing House which has been created alters the situation which arose under the Act of 1929, in any substantial manner. It came to life for the sole purpose of evading the legal consequences of the judgment of the Judicial Committee in the Crystal case [15], and of doing indirectly all that has been declared ultra vires. As Lord Thankerton said in the Crystal Dairy case [16]:\u2014\nThe substantive provision of the Act is to transfer compulsorily a portion of the returns obtained by the traders in the Fluid Milk Market to the traders in the Manufactured Products Market *** In the opinion of their Lordships the adjustment levies are taxes *** it seems to follow that the expense levies in the present case, which are ancillary to the adjustment levies, must also be characterized as taxes. The orders of the Board are also levies imposed on the farmers to obtain revenues, and to equalize the returns of the farmers by giving to some of them out of the receipts more than they should get, and to some others less than what they are entitled to, and for the reasons given by Mr. Justice O'Halloran of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia, and with whom I agree, I believe that this tax is indirect, and, therefore, invalid. Under the orders, the farmers for the fluid milk receive from the Clearing House 56 cents per pound butterfat, and the dealers pay 60 cents to the same Clearing House. These prices are substantially higher than the prices paid before, and it seems clear that the tendency will be to pass that increase on to the ultimate consumer, thus bringing the tax within the well known principles that make it indirect, and therefore invalid.\nThe appellants have also submitted that some evidence given to show the intent and effect of the orders was improperly admitted. I agree with the majority of the Court of Appeal, that the evidence was admissible and that the objection cannot stand. In certain cases, in order to avoid confusion extraneous evidence is required to facilitate the analysis of legislative enactments, and thus disclose their aims which otherwise would remain obscure or even completely concealed. The true purposes and effect of legislation, when revealed to the courts, are indeed very precious elements which must be considered in order to discover its real substance. If it were held that such evidence may not be allowed and that only the form of an Act may be considered, then colourable devices could be used by legislative bodies to deal with matters beyond their powers. The Privy Council took similar views in Attorney-General for Alberta v. Attorney-General for Canada [17], and Lord Maugham delivering judgment for the Judicial Committee said:\u2014\n(Re Object or Intent.)\nA closely similar matter may also call for consideration, namely, the object or purpose of the act in question. It is not competent either for the Dominion or a province under the guise or the pretence or in the form of an exercise of its own powers to carry out an object which is beyond its powers and a trespass on the exclusive powers of the other. Here again matters of which the Court would take judicial notice must be borne in mind and other evidence in a case which calls for it. (Re Effect.)\nThe next step in a case of difficulty will be to examine the effect of the legislation. For that purpose the Court must take into account any public general knowledge of which the Court would take judicial notice and may in a proper case require to be informed by evidence as to what the effect of the legislation will be.\nI believe that this is the law that should govern this case. It applies to the interpretation of federal and provincial statutes, and I cannot see why the courts should withhold its application to orders of a board which is an emanation of a body subject to this rule.\nThe appeal should be dismissed, but with a slight variation in the formal judgment. In their statement of claim the respondents asked that Orders 10, 12, 13, 14 and 15 be declared ultra vires. The Supreme Court of British Columbia and the Court of Appeal declared ultra vires Orders nos. 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15. Order no. 10 which is the order repealing previous orders should stand as decided by the courts below, but Order no. 11 has obviously been set aside by mistake. It provides for the licensing of producers, dairies, producer vendors, etc., and the Act authorizes the fixing and collection of licence fees which are within the powers of the Legislature.\nThe respondents will be entitled to their costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Williams, Manson & Rae.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Farris, Farris, McAlpine, Stultz, Bull & Farris.\n[1] 56 B.C.R. 103 ; [1941] W.W.R. 342 ; [1941] 2 D.L.R.279\n[2] [1940] 3 W.W.R. 42 ; [1941] 2 D.L.R.279, at 280.\n[3] 56 B.C.R. 103 ; [1941] W.W.R. 342 ; [1941] 2 D.L.R. 279\n[4] [1933] A.C. 168.\n[5] [1925] A.C. 338.\n[6] (1893) O..A.R. 372.\n[7] [1933] A.C. 168, at 176.\n[8] (1931) 44 B.C.R. 508.\n[9] (1932) 45 B.C.R. 191.\n[10] [1933] A.C. 168.\n[11] Shannon v.

From time to time, to enable defendant to do, or by reason of its doing, certain works\u2014construction of sewers, pavements, sidewalks, street gradings, street diversions, street widenings, drainage systems, retaining walls, etc.\u2014plaintiff made removals, replacements and repairs of portions of its mains and pipes; and for the cost thereof it claimed payment from defendant.\nSec. 2 of The Public Service Works on Highways Act (now R.S.O., 1937, c. 57) provides: \u201cSubject to the provisions of section 3, where in the course of constructing, reconstructing, changing, altering or improving any highway it becomes necessary to take up, remove or change the location of appliances or works [which, by the Act, include pipes and pipe lines] placed on or under the highway by an operating corporation [which, by the Act, includes a company distributing gas], the road authority [which, by the Act,. includes a municipal corporation] and the operating corporation may agree upon the apportionment of the cost of labour employed in such work and in default of agreement the cost of such work shall be apportioned equally between the road authority and the operating corporation, but such costs shall not include the replacement or renewal of the appliances or works nor the cost of any materials or supplies, nor any other expense or loss occasioned to the operating corporation.\u201d (Plaintiff contended, inter alia, that said provisions did not affect its rights, in view of provisions of its incorporating Act (11 Vict., (Canada), c. 14) and of Acts relating to it).\nPlaintiff also claimed payment from defendant of plaintiff\u2019s cost of making alterations in its mains and pipes ordered by the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada and made necessary by reason of construction, ordered by said Board, of subways at certain places on streets of the city where railway tracks crossed them.\nHeld (affirming judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, [1941] O.R. 175):\n(1) The term \u201chighway\u201d in said Act includes the public streets of a city.\n(2) Said Act governed plaintiff\u2019s right to compensation when defendant\u2019s operations, in exercise of its powers, were of the character described in said s. 2; and in such cases plaintiff was entitled to recover no more than 50% of the labour cost only of its removals, replacements and repairs.\n(3) The construction of certain sewers in question, whether for sanitary purposes or for surface drainage (storm water sewers), could not be regarded as works of defendant which came within the description in said s. 2 (though a storm water sewer might, on a particular set of facts, be properly regarded as \u201can improvement to a highway\u201d within the meaning of said Act); and for relocations of gas mains by reason of such construction the plaintiff was entitled to payment in full. (Kerwin J. dissented as to the storm water sewers, holding that, generally speaking, storm water sewers are constructed by municipalities in the course of improving a highway and that, on the evidence, highways were improved by the storm water sewers in question; a drain may improve a highway under which a gas company has its mains and also other highways from which surface water is drained, but, so long as the first condition exists, said s. 2 applies).\n(4) Plaintiff was not entitled to recover for its cost of the alterations made necessary by reason of said construction of subways.\nAPPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] in so far as it varied the judgment of Hogg J.[2]; and CROSS-APPEAL by the plaintiff from the said judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in so far as it denied to the plaintiff payment in full of its claims.\nThe plaintiff is a Gas Company incorporated in 1848 by an Act of the late Province of Canada, 11 Vict., Cap. XIV (Canada), for the purpose amongst others of supplying the inhabitants of the City of Toronto with gas and it is a Company distributing artificial gas for light, heat and power in the City of Toronto and surrounding municipalities and it has the right under its Act of Incorporation and amending Acts to lay and maintain its mains and pipes in the streets, squares and public places of the said City. The defendant is the Corporation of the City of Toronto.\nFrom time to time, for the purpose of enabling the defendant to do certain works\u2014construction of sewers, pavements, sidewalks., street gradings, street diversions, street widenings, drainage systems, retaining walls, etc.\u2014the plaintiff removed to other locations portions of its mains and pipes, and replaced other portions destroyed and repaired other portions damaged by reason of the defendant\u2019s works. The removals, replacements and repairs now in question were made between March 28, 1929 (the date of the amendment hereinafter mentioned to The Public Service Works on Highways Act) and November 20, 1935. For the cost of these the plaintiff claimed payment from the defendant in full. The defendant contended that it was not liable to pay more than 50% of the labour cost thereof only, by reason of The Public Service Works on Highways Act, as amended on March 28, 1929, (the Act is now c. 57 of R.S.O. 1937). Sec. 2 of that Act provides:\nSubject to the provisions of section 3, where in the course of constructing, reconstructing, changing, altering or improving any highway it becomes necessary to take up, remove or change the location of appliances or works placed on or under the highway by an operating corporation, the road authority and the operating corporation may agree upon the apportionment of the cost of labour employed in such work and in default of agreement the cost of such work shall be apportioned equally between the road authority and the operating corporation, but such costs shall not include the replacement or renewal of the appliances or works nor the cost of any materials or supplies, nor any other expense or loss occasioned to the operating corporation.\nBy said amendment of March 23, 1929 (19 Geo. V, c. 19), the words \u201cappliances and works\u201d in the Act were made to include \u201cpipes and pipe lines,\u201d and the words \u201coperating corporation\u201d in the Act were made to include \u201ca company or individual * * * distributing or supplying * * * artificial or natural gas for light, heat or power.\u201d (The plaintiff contended, inter alia, that, in view of provisions of its incorporating Act and of Acts relating to it, its rights could not be held to be affected by the provisions of The Public Service Works on Highways Act).\nIn the formal judgment at trial (Hogg J.) it was declared that the plaintiff was entitled to be paid 50% of the cost of labour employed for the said removals, replacements and repairs \u201cexcept the relocations of gas mains by reason of the construction of certain sanitary sewers, certain water-mains and the repairing of a leak in a gas main on Dover-court Road\u201d for which excepted items the plaintiff was entitled to payment in full.\nThat part of the judgment at trial was varied by the Court of Appeal by substituting for the words in the judgment at trial \u201cby reason of the construction of certain sanitary sewers\u201d in the said excepted items for which the plaintiff was to be paid in full, the words \u201cby reason of the construction of sewers,\u201d thus including within the excepted items for which the plaintiff was to be paid in full the relocations by reason of the construction of \u201cstorm\u201d or \u201csurface drainage\u201d sewers, as well as sanitary sewers.\nThe Court of Appeal agreed with the trial judge in holding that the term \u201chighway\u201d in said Act included the public streets of a city, and that said Act governed the plaintiff\u2019s right to compensation when the defendant City\u2019s operations were of the character described in said s. 2. But it held that the statute could be applied only in cases where, in undertaking the work that had made it necessary to take up, remove or change plaintiff\u2019s mains or pipes, the defendant City had proceeded in the exercise of its powers to \u201cconstruct, reconstruct, change, alter or improve\u201d a highway; and that the construction of a sewer, whether for sanitary purposes or for surface drainage, does not come within that description, even if incidentally it does effect some improvement in the highway. The Court stated that it is common knowledge that when intended to carry surface water only, a sewer usually has connections for surface drainage with the private properties that front on the street, and in many cases carries as well the surface water from other streets than that upon which it is laid.\nThe plaintiff also claimed payment from the defendant of the plaintiff\u2019s cost of making alterations in its mains and service pipes ordered by the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada and made necessary by reason of construction, ordered by the said Board, of subways on streets of the defendant City at certain places where tracks of railway companies crossed streets of the defendant. On this claim the defendant denied liability. This claim was dismissed by the trial judge and the dismissal was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.\nBy the judgment at trial, costs were given to defendant. This was changed by the Court of Appeal, which ordered that there be no costs to either of the parties. The Court of Appeal (by express statement) made no order as to costs of the appeal.\nThe defendant appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada from that part of the judgment of the Court of Appeal which varied the judgment of Hogg J. The plaintiff cross-appealed, asking that the judgment of the Court of Appeal should be varied in so far as it allowed the plaintiff only 50% of the cost of labour employed for certain removals, replacements and repairs as aforesaid, and in so far as it dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s claim for the cost of the alterations made necessary by reason of the construction of subways as aforesaid; and asked that the plaintiff\u2019s claim in the action be allowed in full. By the judgment of this Court, now reported, the appeal and cross-appeal were dismissed with costs; Kerwin J. dissenting in respect of the appeal.\nF.A.A. Campbell K.C. and John Johnston for the appellant.\nW.N. Tilley K.C. and J.L. Wilson K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Rinfret, Davis and Hudson JJ. was delivered by\nDAVIS J.\u2014I should dismiss both the appeal and the cross-appeal with costs.\nThere is nothing that I can usefully add to the careful reasons for the judgment of the Court of Appeal[3], which were written by the Chief Justice of Ontario, except to say (and I do not think the Chief Justice would disagree with this) that a storm water relief sewer might, on a particular set of facts, be properly regarded as \u201can improvement to a highway\u201d within the meaning of The Public Service Works on Highways Act. But where, as in the present case, you have a storm sewer built from Yonge street at Hayden street southerly to and along Wellesley street and southeasterly into the Don river, serving such a large central district of the city (the evidence puts it: \u201calmost the entire district north of Wellesley street and east of Yonge, south of Bloor street\u201d), I quite agree with the judgment in appeal that it cannot be treated as the improvement of a particular highway within the meaning of the statute so as to require the gas company to remove or change the location of its appliances or works placed on or under the highway, on the statutory basis of being compensated only to the extent of one-half its cost of labour, without any compensation for the cost of materials or supplies necessitated by the replacement or renewal of the appliances or works or for any other expense or loss thereby occasioned to the company.\nKERWIN J. (dissenting in part)\u2014I agree with what the trial judge and the Court of Appeal have said with reference to the matters involved in the cross-appeal, and have nothing further to add. The appeal itself is concerned with three storm water sewers, constructed by the appellant and in connection with which it became necessary for the respondent to change the location of its gas pipes. The trial judge found that each of the sewers fell within the terms of section 2 of The Public Service Works on Highways Act, but the Court of Appeal considered that the statute could be applied only \u201cin cases where, in undertaking the work that has made it necessary to take up, remove or change [the Gas Company\u2019s] mains or pipes, [the City] has proceeded in the exercise of its powers to construct, reconstruct, change, alter or improve a highway,\u201d and that the construction of a sewer for surface drainage did not come within that description, even if it incidentally effected some improvement in the highway.\nWith deference, I am of opinion that, generally speaking, storm water sewers are constructed by municipalities in the course of improving a highway, and that the evidence in this case makes it clear that highways were improved by the particular storm water sewers. By section 455 of the Municipal Act, the council of every municipality has jurisdiction over all highways within the municipality, and by section 480 they are to be kept in repair by such municipality. This power and duty are irrespective of any other authority, such, for instance, as that conferred by subsection 7 of section 404, to construct and maintain drains, sewers or water-courses. A drain may improve a highway under which the Gas Company has its mains and also other highways from which surface water is drained, but, so long as the first condition exists, section 2 of The Public Service Works on Highways Act applies. I understand no difficulty arises in connection with the work at the Eastern Avenue bridge over the Don river, in the sense referred to in the reasons for judgment in the Court of Appeal. The appeal should be allowed and the judgment at the trial restored.\nThe appellant pleaded tender of the total amount found to be due the respondent, with the exception of $443.79. The trial judge, ordered the respondent to pay the costs of the action, but the Court of Appeal, after pointing out that there was no proper plea of tender before action and that no money was paid into Court by the appellant, directed that there should be no costs of the action or of the appeal. This direction might stand, but the appellant is entitled to its costs of the appeal and cross-appeal to this Court.\nAppeal and cross-appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: C.M. Colquhoun.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Mulock, Milliken, Clark & Redman.\n[1] [1941] O.R. 175; [1940] 4 D.L.R. 670.\n[2] [1941] O.R. 175; [1940] 2 D.L.R. 367.\n[3] [1941] O.R. 175; [1940] 4 D.L.R. 670.\n",

The trial judge found that there was no contract between plaintiff and defendant but, when delivering judgment, gave leave to plaintiff to amend its statement of claim by adding an allegation that the goods were damaged by the negligence of defendant, and gave judgment for plaintiff. Said allowance of amendment and judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal for Ontario ([1940] O.W.N. 452; [1940] 4 D.L.R. 629) subject to giving to defendant an opportunity (not exercised) of denying negligence (it was held that the onus was on defendant to disprove negligence) and having a new trial on the questions raised by the amendment. Defendant appealed to this Court.\nDefendant claimed that its carriage of the goods was subject to conditions in a standard form of bill of lading approved by the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada, one of which conditions provided that, unless a certain notice of loss was given, the carrier should not be liable, and another gave to the carrier (on reimbursing to the insured the premiums paid) the full benefit of any insurance that might have been effected upon the goods, \u201cso far as this shall not avoid the policies or contracts of insurance.\u201d There was insurance, and after the loss the insurers advanced a sum to plaintiff under terms set up in a loan receipt, by which the sum was received \u201cas a loan, not a payment of any claim,\u201d and plaintiff agreed \u201cto repay this loan to the extent of any net recovery made from\u201d any carrier responsible for the loss, and authorized the insurers to sue the carrier in plaintiff\u2019s name. The policy was subject to the provisions of the (Imperial) Marine Insurance Act, 1906 (c. 41, s. 79), providing specifically for subrogation.\nHeld: Defendant\u2019s appeal should be dismissed. The affirmance (in terms as aforesaid) by the Court of Appeal of allowance of said amendment and of judgment for plaintiff on the ground of negligence was right.\nEven if the conditions in said standard form of bill of lading were available to defendant (as to which, quaere), the conditions relied on did not afford a defence. As to the condition as to notice (non-observance of which was not pleaded but was claimed at trial): Per the Chief Justice: Defendant was bound to plead non-observance, and no amendment should in the circumstances be allowed. Per Rinfret, Kerwin, Hudson and Taschereau JJ.: In view of the evidence as to actual notice of the damage and of intention to make claim, and subsequent conduct of the parties, a defence based on this condition was not maintainable. As to the condition as to insurance: Per curiam: Any contract made by plaintiff which would impair the insurers\u2019 right of subrogation would relieve the latter from liability. Under the terms of the loan receipt the insurers would be entitled to return of the money advanced if it were found that they had been deprived of the fruit of subrogation because of some action by the insured. There was no suggestion, and it was entirely improbable, that the insurers knew anything about the condition now set up. Under the circumstances, the condition was not operative.\nAPPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] dismissing the defendant\u2019s appeal from the judgment of Rose C.J.H.C.[2] adjudging that the plaintiff recover the sum of $2,765.26 for loss suffered by the plaintiff by reason of damage to its goods by derailment and fire at Bagot station, while being carried on defendant\u2019s railway en route to Schumacher, Ontario. The goods had been purchased by plaintiff from manufacturers in England and on their arrival at Saint John, New Brunswick, the shipping line, pursuant to instruction in the bill of lading, delivered them to defendant for carriage to Schumacher. In its statement of claim, as originally framed, plaintiff alleged that defendant undertook to transport the goods from Saint John, N.B., and deliver them at Schumacher, Ont.; that defendant did not deliver the goods as undertaken, the goods having been damaged as a result of a train derailment on defendant\u2019s railway line at Bagot station; that plaintiff lost the sum for which it claimed by reason of the default of defendant to deliver the goods in pursuance of its duty and\/or undertaking. A question arose as to whether or not there was any contractual relationship between plaintiff and defendant on which plaintiff could make a claim based on contract. The trial judge, Rose, C.J.H.C., was of opinion that there was no contract between plaintiff and defendant, but, when delivering judgment, gave leave to plaintiff to amend its statement of claim by adding an allegation that the goods were damaged by the negligence of the defendant; and gave judgment for the plaintiff. The Court of Appeal upheld the trial judge in allowing the amendment to plead negligence, but gave an opportunity to defendant to deny negligence and have a new trial on the questions raised by the amendment. (The Court was of opinion that the onus was upon the defendant to disprove negligence.) The formal judgment in the Court of Appeal, reciting \u201cthat the defendant has elected not to file an affidavit denying negligence pursuant to leave granted by the court,\u201d ordered that the appeal be dismissed with costs.\nIn its statement of defence the defendant pleaded (inter alia) that the shipment delivered to it and transportation thereof by it \u201cwas subject to the tariffs and classifications in effect on the date the said shipment was received by\u201d defendant \u201cand to all terms, conditions and exceptions of the Carriers carrying the said shipment beyond the port of discharge, and in particular but without limitation to the conditions set forth in the form of Straight Bill of Lading approved by the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada by Order No. 7562 dated the 15th day of July, 1909.\u201d\nThe conditions relied upon by defendant were in respect to notice and insurance and are set out in the reasons for judgment in this Court now reported. Non-observance of the condition as to notice was not pleaded but was claimed at trial. As to the condition as to insurance, defendant (after pleading that it was not liable in law for any loss or damage by reason of the fire) pleaded in the alternative that if it was liable on account of loss of or damage to any of the goods, it was ready and willing to reimburse to the insured the premiums paid in respect thereof and was entitled to the full benefit of any insurance that might have been effective on account of the said goods.\nThe appeal to this Court was dismissed with costs.\nR.E. Laidlaw K.C. and A.D. McDonald for the appellant.\nT.N. Phelan K.C. and B. O\u2019Brien for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2014I agree that the amendment directed by the Chief Justice of the High Court, Rose, C.J., was a competent and proper amendment. Mr. Justice Middleton in his judgment has given convincing reasons for this, with which I agree, and I will add nothing to them.\nIt is unnecessary to decide whether or not the statement of claim without the amendment contained a sufficient allegation of negligence. Failure to deliver by reason of damage to the goods \u201cas a result of a train derailment\u201d is alleged. Derailment of the train would be evidence of negligence sufficient to constitute a prima facie case. Whether there is a presumption of law that the goods were damaged by reason of the carrier\u2019s negligence, within the meaning of the rules of pleading, is a question on which it is unnecessary to express any opinion.\nNegligence being established, it is not disputed that the appellants are responsible unless relieved by the conditions in the bill of lading. Here again it is unnecessary, in my view, to decide whether or not the rights of the respondents are regulated by these conditions, and I should prefer to reserve for another occasion the decision of the question whether, in circumstances such as those presented by this case, the railway company is not protected by the stipulations of the bill of lading.\nThe two conditions upon which the appellants rely are that relating to notice and that relating to insurance. As regards the first, the appellants were, in my opinion, bound to plead non\u2011observance of the condition and no amend- ment ought, in the circumstances, to be allowed. As regards the second, the appellant\u2019s contention, in my opinion, fails.\nFor the reasons given by my brother Hudson, I think the carrier cannot be given the benefit of the policy of insurance without avoiding the policy and, consequently, the condition is not operative.\nThe question does not arise, I may add, whether, assuming the appellants are not entitled to the benefit of the conditions of the bill of lading, their liability in respect of the goods would necessarily rest upon the negligence of their servants. Lord Dunedin\u2019s judgment in London & North Western Railway Company v. Richard Hudson & Sons, Ltd.[3] seems to show that, according to the view of that great judge, the appellants would be responsible as insurers, unless, of course, as regards Dominion railway companies the common law obligation is in some way affected by the provisions of the Railway Act.\nI should dismiss the appeal with costs.\nThe judgment of Rinfret, Kerwin, Hudson and Taschereau JJ. was delivered by\nHUDSON J.\u2014A quantity of sodium cyanide belonging to the plaintiffs, while being conveyed by the defendants on their railway, was badly damaged, and this action was brought to recover for the loss sustained.\nAt the trial, Chief Justice Rose held that the goods had been damaged under circumstances justifying a finding of negligence and gave judgment for the plaintiffs.\nOn appeal to the Court of Appeal, the learned judges there thought that the defendants should be given the option of giving evidence on the question of negligence, if they so desired, but, defendants failing to take advantage of this option, the appeal was dismissed.\nThe writ, as endorsed, was quite wide enough to enable the plaintiffs to plead either in tort or in contract, but the statement of claim did not in terms allege negligence and, in the opinion of the learned trial judge, was not wide enough to cover a claim in tort. However, at the time of delivering his judgment, he gave leave to amend by adding an allegation of negligence, and this was done. The propriety of granting leave to amend was a major subject of controversy in the Court of Appeal, but the only concession made to the defendants was the option to give evidence rebutting negligence. I agree with the decision of the Court of Appeal on this point for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Middleton.\nOn the merits, the material evidence is very fully set forth in the judgment of Chief Justice Rose. Briefly, the plaintiffs had bought a quantity of sodium cyanide in England, which was shipped by a through bill of lading from Newcastle-on-Tyne in England to Schumacher in Ontario. On arrival at the Port of Saint John the goods were transferred to the defendant company, for carriage by rail. No bill of lading was issued by the railway company and there is no evidence of a contract of carriage, except what can be extracted from a way-bill apparently prepared by the Shipping Company\u2019s agent, stating the freight rate to be charged on the shipment from Saint John to Schumacher, such rate being at a figure which would indicate that the goods were being shipped on what is known as a standard bill of lading, the form of which had been approved by the Board of Railway Commissioners.\nAt the trial, the defendants contended that there was no contractual relationship between the plaintiffs and themselves and that their only contract was with the shipowners, for whom they acted as agents. In the alternative, they claimed that they received the goods on the conditions and limitations of the standard bill of lading approved by the Board of Railway Commissioners, and were entitled to the benefit of certain conditions therein respecting insurance and notice of claim.\nThe plaintiffs claimed under a contract of carriage and in the alternative for negligence.\nThe learned trial judge held that the contract made with the shipowners was an entire contract for the carriage of the goods from Newcastle to Schumacher, and that the shipowners had no authority on behalf of the plaintiffs to enter into a contract with the defendants for the carriage of the goods for a portion of the distance. He held that, in the absence of contract, the case was in principle the same as Allen v. Canadian Pacific Ry. Co.[4], which was binding on him, and that under the circumstances here the defendants were not entitled to rely upon the terms of a standard bill of lading. Having come to this conclusion, and that defendant had been negligent, he did not find it necessary to deal with the effect of the conditions of the bill of lading, if applicable.\nAs I have said before, the main question argued before the Court of Appeal was the propriety of allowing the amendment setting up negligence. That question having been disposed of, the Court of Appeal had no difficulty in dismissing the appeal.\nThe defendants, having caused the loss through their negligence, are liable unless there is some limitation on their liability beyond what is given them by the common law. It has been held by Chief Justice Rose, and indeed it was contended on behalf of the defendants, that there was no privity of contract between the defendants and plaintiffs, and the limitation on liability, if any, must arise in some other way.\nThe defendants say that they received the goods on the conditions and limitations of the standard bill of lading approved by the Board of Railway Commissioners, and were entitled to the benefit of certain conditions therein respecting insurance and notice of claim. It will be convenient here to state the terms and conditions on which the defendants rely. The first is:\nNotice of loss, damage or delay must be made in writing to the Carrier at the point of delivery, or to the Carrier at the point of origin, within four months after delivery of the goods, or in case of failure to make delivery, then within four months after a reasonable time for delivery has elapsed. Unless notice is so given the Carrier shall not be liable.\nThe defendants did not plead the absence of such notice but claimed in the course of the trial that there was noncompliance with this condition. It appears from the evidence that the defendants were properly notified of the damage and that in due course a claim would be made for the loss, when the amount had been ascertained. Thereafter, the officers of the plaintiffs and defendants actively co-operated in an endeavour to minimize the loss as much as possible. The circumstances are more fully set forth in the judgment of Mr. Justice Middleton in the Court below. The defence on this point is purely technical and without merit and should not be upheld.\nThe second condition relied upon is:\nAny Carrier or party liable on account of loss or damage to any of said goods, on reimbursing to the insured the premiums paid in respect thereof, shall have the full benefit of any insurance that may have been effected upon or on account of said goods, so far as this shall not avoid the policies or contracts of insurance.\nThe defendants plead alternatively that\nif the defendant is liable on account of loss of or damage to any of the said goods, it is ready and willing to reimburse to the insured the premiums paid in respect thereof and is entitled to the full benefit of any insurance that may have been effective on account of the said goods.\nThe facts are, that the goods were insured by the consignors at the time they were loaded on the ship at Newcastle. The policy was a marine policy but covered the goods not only by sea but also by rail to Schumacher. After the loss occurred, the insurance company made an advance on the condition set up in a loan receipt reading as follows:\nReceived from IMPERIAL CHEMICALS INSURANCE LIMITED and THE MARITIME INSURANCE COMPANY LIMITED the sum of \u00a31,439.9.2, as a loan, not a payment of any claim, pending the ascertainment whether the loss is a loss for which any Carrier, Bailee or other person is responsible; and I\/we hereby agree to repay this loan to the extent of any net recovery made from, or from any insurance effected by, any such Carrier, Bailee or other person, and as security for such repayment I\/we hereby pledge to said Insurance Company all such claims and any recovery thereon. I\/we hereby appoint the Officers of said Insurance Company and their Successors, severally, my\/our Agents and Attorneys in fact, with irrevocable power to collect any such claim and to begin, prosecute, compromise or withdraw in my\/our name, or in the name of the Insurance Company, but at the expense of the Insurance Company, any and all legal proceedings deemed necessary to the Insurance Company to enforce such claim or claims, and to execute in my\/our name any documents, including receipts and releases, which may be necessary or convenient to carry into effect the purposes of this Agreement.\nCANADIAN INDUSTRIES LIMITED\nF.T. PARKER.\nCANADIAN INDUSTRIES LIMITED\nP.R. BARRY.\nMONTREAL, June 30\/38.\nThe policy was subject to the provisions of the (Imperial) Marine Insurance Act, 1906, chapter 41, section 79, providing specifically for subrogation. If the plaintiffs or their successors entered into any contract which would impair this right of subrogation, the insurance company would be relieved from liability: see Arnould on Marine Insurance, 12th Edition, Vol. 2, pages 1639 et seq.; and also Porter on Insurance, 8th Edition, page 238, and the case of Inman v. South Carolina Ry. Co.[5]\nUnder the terms of the loan receipt the insurance company would, I think, be entitled to a return of the money advanced if it were found that they had been deprived of the fruit of subrogation because of some action by the insured. There is no suggestion here that the insurance company had been advised of any condition such as that set up; in fact, it is entirely improbable that they knew anything about it. Under these circumstances, it would seem clear that the condition relied upon could not in any way cover the circumstances here.\nTherefore, even if the conditions in a standard bill of lading could be invoked, they do not afford the defendants any defence.\nThe question of whether or not the defendants had the right to set up the conditions of the standard bill of lading against the plaintiffs is more difficult. It is now common ground that there was no privity of contract between the parties. The plaintiffs could not set up the terms of the contract against the defendants. How, then, could the defendants set up the terms of the contract against the plaintiffs?\nIn Pollock on Torts, 14th Edition, page 436, it is stated:\nWherever the parties have come into such a relation that a duty to take proper care can be established without reference to any contract, there the violation of that duty by negligence is a tort, whether it consist in commission or in omission, and whether there be in fact a contract or not.\nThis is illustrated in the case of Meux v. Great Eastern Railway Company[6]. In this case a servant of the plaintiff took a ticket for a journey on the defendants\u2019 railway, and a portmanteau of his was accepted as his personal luggage. The portmanteau contained property belonging to the plaintiff, his mistress. This property was destroyed through the misconduct of defendants\u2019 servant. It was held in the Court of Appeal that the defendants were liable. Lord Esher, at page 390: There being no contract in this case with the plaintiff, she gets no right to sue for a breach of the contract which was made, and there is no duty towards her arising on contract. There is nothing in such a state of things that deprives the plaintiff of a right which she has independently of contract, and which she would have even if there were no contract. * * * They cannot say that it was done without their authority; and, therefore, for such a wrongful act the person injured has a right of action against them, although as between him and them there was no contract, and although there was a contract between them and some one else with regard to the luggage.\nSee also Foulkes v. Metropolitan District Ry. Co.[7], particularly the remarks of Lord Bramwell at pages 158-159.\nHowever, some modification of this principle is suggested in more recent cases, the principal one of which is Elder, Dempster & Co. Ltd. v. Paterson, Zochonis & Co. Ltd.[8] This case is fully discussed in the judgment of Chief Justice Rose at the trial, and I will here do no more than quote the concluding words of the judgment of Lord Sumner, at page 564, which was concurred in by a majority of the other members of the Court:\nIt may be, that in the circumstances of this case the obligations to be inferred from the reception of the cargo for carriage to the United Kingdom amount to a bailment upon terms, which include the exceptions and limitations of liability stipulated in the known and contemplated form of bill of lading. It may be, that the vessel being placed in the Elder, Dempster & Co.\u2019s line, the captain signs the bills of lading and takes possession of the cargo only as agent for the charterers, though the time charter recognizes the ship\u2019s possessory lien for hire. The former I regard as the preferable view, but, be this as it may, I cannot find here any such bald bailment with unrestricted liability, or such tortious handling entirely independent of contract, as would be necessary to support the contention.\nThe matter is discussed in a learned note in 50 Law Quarterly Review, at page 8, dealing with some statements made by Mr. Justice Langton in The Kite[9].\nFrom these discussions it does not appear as yet that any defined principle of general application has been evolved.\nI am inclined to agree with the conclusion arrived at by Chief Justice Rose, that the conditions of the standard bill of lading are not available as a defence to this action under all of the circumstances here. However, it is not necessary to give any conclusive opinion on this point and I prefer to base my judgment on the other point, that the particular conditions of this case do not afford a defence. I would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: R.E.

In May and July, 1938, by orders of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, a Receiver (an authorized trustee in bankruptcy) was appointed and immediately entered upon his duties. This action is still pending and the Receiver is still executing his duties In June, 1929, the Community purported to file a proposal under the Farmers Creditors Arrangement Act. In the same month, by County Court orders, \"upon the application of\" the Official Receiver, under said Act, \" for directions,\" \" and upon reading the statement of affairs herein and the proposal and the resolution of the Directors\" of the Community, the latter was \"hereby permitted to make appli- cation under and (was) entitled to take advantage of the provisions of \" said Act, and the Official Receiver was \" hereby permitted to accept the said proposal\" of the Community under said Act. On September 14, 1939, the respondent Board of Review gave notice to the Receiver that a written request by a creditor of the Community had been made to the Board of Review to formulate an acceptable proposal for a composition, extension of time or scheme of arrangements of the affairs of the Community and gave notice of hearing. The appellant immediately on the 16th of September, 1939, brought the present action, claiming, inter alia, a declaration that the respondent Community was not a farmer within the meaning of the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act and was not entitled to the benefit of that Act, that the respondent Board of Review was without jurisdiction and that it had no jurisdiction over the appellant and the other creditors of the Community. The trial judge held that he was invested with jurisdiction to render a decision in the action, and his decision was that the respondent Community was not a farmer within the meaning of the above Act. The appellate court, reversing that judgment, held that the Supreme Court of British Columbia had no jurisdiction in the matter and that, by force of the provisions of the Act, such jurisdiction resided exclusively in the County Court, and it further held that the respondent Community was a farmer.\nHeld, that the respondent Community was not a farmer within the meaning of the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, and, as such, entitled to a proposal for a composition of its liabilities under the provisions of that Act; and, also, that, under the circumstances of this case, the Supreme Court of British Columbia had jurisdiction to determine the questions raised by the appellant's action. Barickman Hutterian Mutual Corporation v. Nault ( [1939] S.C.R. 223) disc, and dist.\nHeld, also, per The Chief Justice and Davis and Hudson JJ., that, under the circumstances of this case, the Supreme Court of British Columbia had jurisdiction to entertain the appellant's action\u2014It is not necessary, for the purpose of this appeal, to determine generally the jurisdiction of the County Court and of the Supreme Court, respectively, in relation to the statutory validity of a proposal filed by a debtor who is invoking the provisions of the statute.\u2014In the present case, property of the respondent Community affected by the debentures was in the hands of a Receiver appointed by the Supreme Court. Whatever may be the effect of the general language of the enactment which purports to give to the County Court exclusive jurisdiction in bankruptcy, such general language cannot be read as giving to the County Court any control over the assets of the respondent Community, in the hands of the Receiver, which could be exercised without the consent of the Supreme Court; and it seems necessarily to follow that it would be within the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to ascertain by an examination of the facts (if such a claim were made) whether or not the purported proceedings under the statute were competent proceedings,\u2014whether or not, in other words, the County Court had acquired exclusive jurisdiction in relation to the debtors' assets by force of the statute. The Board of Review was about to consider a proposal to be formulated under s. 12 (4) (5) of the Act, and, in the case of a proposal being formulated and confirmed by the Board, questions might very well arise as to the position of the Receiver. S. 11, read literally and giving effect to it according to the full scope of its terms, without any qualification, would appear directly to affect the Receiver in any proceedings by him to realize property within the receivership (e.g., in an action to collect a book debt charged by the debentures in suit). Only the very clearest language would justify the conclusion that Parliament intended in these circumstances to deprive the Supreme Court of the authority to decide for itself whether the filing of the Community's proposal had any statutory warrant. The words employed in the first paragraph of section 5 of the Act ought not to be read as excluding the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to decide whether, in such circumstances as those in this case, its jurisdiction in respect of property in its possession, and in respect of proceedings in relation to that property pending before it, has been ousted. The trial judge had all the circumstances before him and, having regard to those circumstances, felt it his duty to pronounce upon the issue. The trial judge was right in exercising the jurisdiction he did exercise. He was not deciding upon any abstract question. It was important that the issue should be decided speedily, to avoid conflict of jurisdiction with resulting confusion and expense. As to the County Court orders (The recital shows that they were made on application for directions before the Community's proposal was filed\u2014and quaere whether, until such filing, the Official Receiver has any status, or the Court any jurisdiction, on such an application): The farmer's right to file a proposal arises from provisions of the Act, not from any leave of the Court; the Act does not contemplate an application for such leave. The purpose of the procedure under Rule 42 is to enable the Official Receiver to obtain directions as to his own acts in the course of administration where the application of the Act, which is the foundation of the authority both of the judge and the Official Receiver, is assumed\u2014it is not its purpose to empower the Court to make binding orders affecting the rights of third persons who are not parties to the proceeding. It does not follow that on an application for directions questions of right and jurisdiction may never be determined. The County Court has jurisdiction, speaking generally, to determine such questions in a summary way, and the hearing of an application for directions in a particular case may be a convenient and unobjectionable occasion for dealing with such questions, when proper care is taken to see that everybody concerned is fully represented and has full opportunity of bringing out the facts and presenting his case. The County Court orders in question should be treated as directions to receive and file proposals, and the statement therein that the Community is permitted to make application under, and is entitled to take advantage of, the provisions of the Act, must be regarded simply as introductory, expressing the judge's opinion quantum valeat with regard to matters upon which he had no authority to make a binding pronouncement.\nPer Rinfret J.\u2014The principal powers of the Board of Review are enumerated in section 12 of the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act and its subsections; but, nowhere is there to be found vested in the Board of Review the power to determine as a question of law the applicability of that Act to a person whose quality and status as a \"farmer\" is disputed, or where it is objected, by some party having an interest in the matter, that the applicant for a proposal does not come within the definition of the Act: the courts of justice are the proper forum where the matter must be debated and determined.- As to the question whether, in a province other than the province of Quebec, an interested party, who decides of his own initiative to contest the status of an applicant as farmer, must necessarily have to institute his proceedings in the county or district court or whether he is deprived of the right of invoking the general jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the province, it should be held, as far as the interpretation of the statute is concerned, that, as the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act may be regarded as a chapter of the Bankruptcy Act, the status of a farmer and the question whether he is entitled to invoke the benefit of the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act are included within the words \" jurisdiction in bankruptcy \" mentioned in the first paragraph of section 5 of the Act and that, therefore, these matters, under the Act, are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the county and district courts of all the provinces except in the province of Quebec.\u2014It does not necessarily follow that the Supreme Courts of these provinces are divested by the Act of their supervisory authority over an official such as the Official Receiver or a board such as the respondent Board of Review, which jurisdiction is exercised through the writs of prohibition, mandamus or certiorari, or possibly by declaration and injunction as contended by the appellant; but this latter question may be left for wider examination in a case where the point may come up squarely for decision\u2014In the present case, however, there is a special situation. The appellant's Debentures Holders' action was instituted prior to the respondent Community's application to the Official Receiver under the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act and before the county court orders were issued. That action is still pending and the Receiver appointed in that action of the Supreme Court of British Columbia is still carrying on his duties. The effect of the Receiver's appointment by the Supreme Court was to put all the property and assets of the Community under the authority of that Court. In such circumstances, its jurisdiction in respect of the assets of the respondent Community and with regard to the proceedings then pending before it could not be interfered with by the mere application of the Official Receiver to the county courts under the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act.\nPer Crocket J.\u2014Upon a consideration of the record and of the relevant provisions of the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act and its regulations the trial judge had full jurisdiction to make the declaration which he did and his judgment was fully warranted by the evidence. If the respondent Community was not a farmer, neither the Official Receiver nor the Board of Review nor any County Court judge had any authority whatsoever to bring the respondent Community within the operation of that Act, and any orders or reports purporting to recognize such respondent as a farmer must be held under the explicit provisions of the Act to have been wholly void and of no effect. If the respondent Community was not a farmer within the meaning of the Act, the fact that a County Court judge had without authority and erroneously found that the respondent Community was a farmer cannot possibly have the effect of ousting the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to pronounce upon the validity of these proceedings and of removing from the custody and control of a special receiver appointed by the Supreme Court for the administration of the British Columbia assets and business of the respondent Community for the realization of the moneys secured by the respondent's deed of trust and mortgage, and placing them in the exclusive control of the county court. Moreover, the whole tenor of the statute negatives the suggestion that the Parliament of Canada intended to interfere with the inherent jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the various provinces to declare the nullity of wholly unauthorized proceedings and orders of all inferior statutory functionaries or tribunals at the suit of those whose property and civil rights such proceedings and orders purport to affect.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal (55 B.C. Rep. 516) reversed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], reversing the judgment of the Supreme Court, Robertson J.[2] which had maintained an action by the appellant in which the latter sought a declaration that the respondent Community was not a farmer within the meaning of the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act.\nA. E. Hoskin K.C. and D. N. Hossie K.C. for the appellant.\nC. L. McAlpine K.C. for the respondent Community.\nF. P. Varcoe K.C. for the respondent Board of Review.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and of Davis and Hudson JJ. was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2014I shall refer to the respondent, The Christian Community of Universal Brotherhood, Limited (which is a company incorporated under the Dominion Companies Act) as the respondent company.\nThe respondent company is not, I am satisfied, on the facts disclosed in the evidence before us, a farmer within the contemplation of the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act of 1934, and for this and other reasons the proceedings of the Official Receiver and the respondent, the Board of Review, were without statutory warrant. Had it not been for the decision of this Court in Barickman v. Nault[3], it would never have occurred to anybody, I think, that the respondent company was a farmer within the intendment of that statute. The only point of law decided in that case was that a corporation may be a farmer and entitled as such to avail itself of the provisions of the statute. In the very special circumstances of that case we held that the corporation was a farmer within the definition\na person whose principal occupation consists in farming or the tillage of the soil.\nThere is little pertinent resemblance between the corporation whose status was there in question and the respondent company, and that decision is really of no assistance in the decision of the question before us. I think it is very clear that, although the members of the Community for the most part are farmers, the incorporated company itself is not a farmer in the ordinary sense of the term, or in the sense of the statute. My brother Rinfret has given conclusive reasons for this.\nAn important question, however, which was very fully argued, arises. That question is whether it is competent to this Court to give practical effect on this appeal to its conclusion that the respondent company has the right to avail itself of the benefit of the enactments of the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, and that question again depends upon the answer to the question whether or not the Supreme Court of British Columbia was competent to adjudicate upon the respondent company's rights in that respect.\nThe Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act provides in section 6 (1) and (2) as follows:\u2014\n6.(1) A farmer who is unable to meet his liabilities as they become due may make a proposal for a composition, extension of time or scheme of arrangement either before or after an assignment has been made.\n(2) Such proposal shall be filed with the Official Receiver who shall forthwith convene a meeting of the creditors and perform the duties and functions required by the Bankruptcy Act to be performed by a trustee in the case of a proposal for a composition, extension of time or scheme of arrangement.\nBy section 7:\u2014\n7. A proposal may provide for a compromise or an extension of time or scheme of arrangement in relation to a debt owing to a secured creditor, or in relation to a debt owing to a person who has acquired movable or immovable property subject to a right of redemption, but in that event the concurrence of the secured creditor or such person, shall be required, except in the case of a proposal formulated and confirmed by the Board of Review as hereinafter provided.\nBy section 11 (1) and (2):\u2014\n11. (1) On the filing with the Official Receiver of a proposal, no creditor whether secured or unsecured, shall have any remedy against the property or person of the debtor, or shall commence or continue any proceedings under the Bankruptcy Act, or any action, execution or other proceedings for the recovery of a debt provable in bankruptcy, or the realization of any security unless with leave of the court and on such terms as the court may impose; Provided, however, that the stay of proceedings herein provided shall only be effective until the date of the final disposition of the proposal. 1938, Ch. 47 Am.\n(2) On a proposal being filed the property of the debtor shall be deemed to be under the authority of the court pending the final disposition of any proceedings in connection with the proposal and the court may make such order as it deems necessary for the preservation of such property.\nBy section 5, subsection (1):\u2014\n5, (1) In the case of an assignment, petition or proposal in the province of Quebec, the Superior Court of the judicial district where the farmer resides, and in other provinces, the county or district court, shall have exclusive jurisdiction in bankruptcy subject to appeal as provided in section one hundred and seventy-four of the Bankruptcy Act.\nThe statute also provides for a Board of Review consisting of a Chief Commissioner and two Commissioners, and that where the Official Receiver reports that a farmer has made a proposal, but that no proposal has been approved by the creditors, the Board shall, on the written request of a creditor or of the debtor, endeavour to formulate an acceptable proposal, and the Board shall consider representations. If the proposal so formulated is accepted by the debtor and the creditors it is to be filed in Court and then, by force of section 12, subsection (5), it becomes binding on the debtor and all the creditors. Even where a debtor and the creditors refuse to approve a proposal so formulated the Board may, nevertheless, confirm the proposal with or without amendments, and on being filed in Court it becomes binding on all the creditors and the debtor as if it had been accepted by the creditors and approved by the Court.\nIn May, 1938, the appellants instituted in the Supreme Court of British Columbia a Debenture Holders action against the respondent company, praying foreclosure or sale of certain properties and assets mortgaged to the appellant to secure the payment of debentures. In May and July, 1938, by orders of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, one G. L. Salter was appointed Receiver and immediately entered upon his duties. This action is still pending and the Receiver is still executing his duties.\nIn June, 1939, the respondent company purported to file a proposal under the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act and on the 14th of September, 1939, the Board of Review sent to the Receiver a notice stating that a written request by a creditor of the respondent company had been addressed to the Board of Review, requesting the Board to formulate an acceptable proposal for a composition, extension of time or scheme of arrangements of the affairs of the said company, and that this request would be dealt with at Nelson, in the county of Kootenay, on the 26th of September, 1939. The appellants immediately commenced an action in the Supreme Court of British Columbia, claiming, among other things, a declaration that the respondent company is not a farmer entitled to take advantage of the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act.\nThe issue of substance which the appellants sought to raise in their action in the Supreme Court of British Columbia was, of course, the question whether the respondent company was entitled to take advantage of the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act. The appellants, being the holders of debentures in the amount of three hundred and fifty thousand dollars ($350,000) and having, as already observed, in a Debenture Holders action had a Receiver appointed of property affected by their security in British Columbia, had, of course, an immediate and practical concern in the proceedings taken by the respondent company, purporting it to be under the authority of the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act.\nThe statute, as appears from the enactments already set out, where a proposal, which is a proper proposal within the contemplation of the statute, is filed by a person who is entitled to the benefit of the provisions of the statute, effects (inter alia) a stay of all proceedings taken by the holder of the security to realize his security pending at the time the proposal is filed; and also brings the property of the debtor filing the proposal under the authority of the Court, which is the County Court of the county in which the debtor resides, and gives the County Court authority to make orders for the preservation of the property.\nFurthermore (it cannot be too plainly kept in view), authority is given to the Board of Review to formulate a proposal providing for a compromise and extension of time or scheme of arrangement in relation (inter alia) to a debt owing to a secured creditor, and such proposal so formulated by the Board may be confirmed by the Board and filed in the County Court and thereupon (even without the consent of the secured creditor) it becomes binding upon all the creditors and the debtor.\nThe appellants, I repeat, were naturally and properly concerned with these proceedings, and when they received notice from the Board that the Board intended to consider the framing of a proposal they instituted their action in the Supreme Court of British Columbia, as already mentioned.\nOn behalf of the respondent company and the Board of Review it was argued that the statute invests the County Court with exclusive jurisdiction in bankruptcy and that this includes any proceeding to determine the question raised by the action; and so precludes the exercise of jurisdiction therein by the Supreme Court. I do not think it is necessary for the purpose of this appeal to determine generally the jurisdiction of the County Court and of the Supreme Court, respectively, in relation to the statutory validity of a proposal filed by a debtor who is invoking the provisions of the statute. Prima facie it would seem that an application made to the County Court judge to set aside such a proposal as incompetent would fall within the \"jurisdiction of bankruptcy\" within the meaning of the statute, and that the County Court judge would have jurisdiction to pass upon such an application.\nIn the present case property of the respondent company affected by the debentures is in the hands of a Receiver appointed by the Supreme Court of British Columbia. On general principles any attempt to interfere with the possession of the Receiver would constitute contempt of court. In the absence of some statute to the contrary effect, the Supreme Court would not permit even an action to be brought against the Receiver in respect of his receivership, unless leave of the Court were first obtained. Blair v. Maidstone [4]; Russell v. East Anglia Rly. Co.[5]; Coleman v. Grenville [6], per Strong, V.C. This, of course, is well-known law. Whatever may be the effect of the general language of the enactment which purports to give to the County Court exclusive jurisdiction in bankruptcy, such general language cannot, in my opinion, be read as giving to the County Court any control over the assets of the respondent company, in the hands of the Receiver, which could be exercised without the consent of the Supreme Court. Only the most precise language would justify one in ascribing such an intention to the legislature; and it seems necessarily to follow that it would be within the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to ascertain by an examination of the facts (if such a claim were made) whether or not the purported proceedings under the statute were competent proceedings,\u2014whether or not, in other words, the County Court had acquired exclusive jurisdiction in relation to the debtors' assets by force of the statute.\nIn the present case the Board of Review was about to proceed to consider a proposal to be formulated under section 12, subsections (4) and (5) and, in the case of a proposal being formulated and confirmed by the Board of Review, questions might very well arise as to the position of the Receiver. It is to be noticed that section 11 read literally, when effect is given to it according to the full scope of its terms, without any qualification, would appear directly to affect the Receiver in any proceedings by him to realize property within the receivership\u2014in an action, for example, to collect a book debt charged by the debentures in suit. Only the very clearest language would, I repeat, justify the conclusion that the legislature intended in these circumstances to deprive the Supreme Court of the authority to decide for itself whether the filing of the proposal had any statutory warrant.\nThe principle of Stradling v. Morgan [7] must, I think, be applied. The words employed ought not, I think, to be read as excluding the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to decide whether, in such circumstances as those before us, its jurisdiction in respect of property in its possession, and in respect of proceedings in relation to that property pending before it, has been ousted. The learned trial judge had all the circumstances before him and, having regard to those circumstances, felt it his duty to pronounce upon the issue. He held that the respondent company is not a farmer within the contemplation of the statute, a conclusion with which, as I have mentioned, we are in entire agreement.\nAs already observed, the only point remaining to be considered is whether or not the trial judge was also right in exercising the jurisdiction he did exercise, or whether, on the contrary, the County Court was solely competent to pass upon the issue presented to him. If the learned trial judge was wrong in holding that he was invested with jurisdiction, the only course open to us would be to dismiss the appeal, with the result that the question must go back to the County Court for determination, and the time and energy spent in trying the issue before the Supreme Court judge and in arguing it before the Court of Appeal and before this Court thrown away. Happily, in my opinion, this course is not forced upon us because I think the trial judge's decision on the question of jurisdiction, as well as his decision on the question of substance, is right. He was not deciding upon any abstract question. It was important that the issue should be decided speedily in order to avoid conflict of jurisdiction, with resulting confusion and expense.\nWith the deepest respect for the learning and the judgment of the able and experienced Chief Justice of British Columbia, I am, for the reasons I have indicated, unable to accept his conclusion. I may add, also, that I have read the valuable judgment of Mr. Justice O'Halloran with care, but, with respect, it does not meet the point upon which I think the appeal must be decided.\nI think perhaps some observations ought to be made upon certain orders by the judges of the County Court of Yale and the County Court of West Kootenay, respectively.\nOn the 26th of June an order was made by Judge Kelly, of the County Court of Yale, and on the 28th of the same month an order in the same terms was made by Judge Nisbet, of the County Court of West Kootenay. These orders are in the following terms:\u2014 June 1939.\nIn the County Court of\nholden at\nIn the matter of \"The Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, 1934,\" and Amendments thereto, and\nIn the matter of a proposal for composition, extension or scheme of arrangement of The Christian Community of Universal Brotherhood,\nLimited, Farmer.\nBefore His Honour Judge in Court\n, the\nday of June, 1939.\nUpon the application of Walter Gordon Wilkins, an Official Receiver under the said Farmers' Creditors Arrangements Act, 1934, and amendments thereto for directions.\nAnd upon reading the statement of affairs herein and the proposal and the resolution of the Directors of the said Christian Community of Universal Brotherhood Limited and the affidavit of Nicholas M. Plotnikoff attached thereto.\nIt is ordered that the said Christian Community of Universal Brotherhood Limited is hereby permitted to make application under and is entitled to take advantage of the Provisions of the said Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, 1934, and amendments thereto.\nAnd it is further ordered that the said Official Receiver, Walter Gordon Wilkins, is hereby permitted to accept the said proposal of the Christian Community of Universal Brotherhood Limited under the said Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, 1934, and amendments thereto.\nJudge, County Court of\n(SEAL)\nC. C. of\nEntered this\n1939\nday of June,\nRegistrar,\nCounty Court.\nThe recital shows that the order was made on an application by the Official Receiver to the County Court for directions before the proposal was filed. It may be open to question whether until the proposal is filed the Official Receiver has any status, or the Court any jurisdiction, under Rule 42. It is not necessary, however, to decide that point.\nSection 6 of the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act does not contemplate a proposal filed by leave of the County Court; it does not contemplate an application for such leave by a person seeking to avail himself of the provisions of the statute. The right of the farmer is a statutory right arising from the provisions of the statute and not from any leave of the Court. Rule 42 does not empower the County Court to give any direction contrary to the Act, or, on an ex parte application in the absence of the parties known to be principally concerned, to adjudicate upon any controversy touching the right of any person to file a proposal as an insolvent farmer under the authority of section 6 of the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act. The purpose of the procedure under rule 42 is to enable the Official Receiver to obtain the advice of the Court in matters of administration where the application of the Act, which is the foundation of the authority of the judge as well as the Official Receiver, is assumed. The purpose of the procedure is to enable the Official Receiver to obtain directions as to his own acts in the course of administration for his own protection and for the orderly conduct of the administration; it is not its purpose to empower the Court to make binding orders affecting the rights of third persons who are not parties to the proceeding.\nIt does not follow, of course, that on an application for directions, when all parties are present, questions of right and jurisdiction may never be determined. The County Court has jurisdiction, speaking generally, to determine such questions in a summary way and the hearing of an application for directions in a particular case may be a convenient occasion for dealing with such questions, and there can be no objection to such a course when proper care is taken to see that everybody concerned is fully represented and has a full opportunity of bringing out the facts and presenting his case.\nThe proper way to read the orders is to treat them as directions to the Official Receiver to receive and file proposals and the earlier paragraph must be regarded simply as introductory, expressing the judge's opinion quantum valeat with regard to matters upon which he had no authority to make a binding pronouncement.\nI think the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the learned trial judge restored with costs throughout.\nRINFRET J.\u2014Prior to the commencement of the action in respect of which the present appeal is asserted, the appellant had, on May 18th, 1938, commenced in the Supreme Court of British Columbia a Debentures Holders' action against the respondent Community, asking for the foreclosure, or sale, of certain properties and assets of the Community mortgaged to the appellant by the Community to secure the payment of certain bonds of the Community which are still outstanding and unpaid. In that first action, one Mr. G. L. Salter, a chartered accountant and authorized trustee in bankruptcy, was appointed Receiver by Orders of the said Supreme Court of British Columbia, dated May 18th and July 15th, 1938.\nThe Receiver immediately entered upon his duties as such and he has ever since and still is carrying on the same; and the Debentures Holders' action is still pending in the Supreme Court.\nThe Receiver is and at all material times was an Officer of the Supreme Court of British Columbia.\nAbout the end of the month of June, 1939, the Community purported to file a proposal under the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, 1934; and, on or about August 1st, 1939, it purported to make a request under that Act to the respondent Board of Review.\nOn September 14th, 1939, the Board sent out a notice of hearing, whereupon the appellant brought the present action on September 16th, 1939.\nAt all material times, the Debentures Holders' action was proceeding in the Supreme Court of British Columbia and the Receiver appointed by that Court was in charge and acting.\nIn the present action, the appellant alleged, among other things, that the Community was not a farmer within the meaning of the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act and was not entitled to the benefit of that Act; that the Community had not made a proposal for a composition, extension of time or scheme of arrangement pursuant to the Act; and that accordingly the Act had no application to the Community, and the Board of Review for the province of British Columbia was without jurisdiction, that it had no jurisdiction over the appellant and the other creditors of the Community.\nThe appellant asked and claimed:\n(a) A declaration that the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act of 1934 does not apply to the respondent Community;\n(b) A declaration that the Community is not entitled to make a proposal for a composition of its liabilities under the provisions of the Act; (c) A declaration that the respondent Board is not authorized or empowered and has no jurisdiction to hold a hearing, or formulate a proposal for such a composition;\n(d) A declaration that all proceedings of the Board pursuant to the application of the Community are null and void;\n(e) An injunction restraining the respondents, and each of them, from taking any further steps under the Act with respect to the application of the Community, or with respect to its liabilities;\n(f) The costs of this action;\n(g) Such further or other relief as to this Honourable Court may seem meet.\nThe formal judgment of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, at the trial before Robertson J. [8], was a declaration that the Community was not a farmer within the meaning of the Act; and it gave liberty to apply for an injunction as against the Board, in the event of its deciding to proceed with the \"Request for Review.\" The judgment gave costs to the appellant against the Community.\nHaving decided that the Community was not a farmer within the meaning of the Act, the learned judge stated that, under the circumstances, it was not necessary to consider the appellant's alternative submissions.\nBoth the Community and the Board appealed from this judgment to the Court of Appeal of British Columbia, where the appeal was allowed and the judgment was set aside with costs against the present appellant [9].\nThe Court of Appeal decided that the Supreme Court of British Columbia had no jurisdiction in the matter and that, by force of the provisions of the Act, such jurisdiction resided exclusively in the County Court. It decided further that, on the authority of Barickman Hutterian Mutual Corporation v. Nault [10], the Community was a farmer.\nThe other questions raised in the action have not been dealt with by the appeal court.\nThe substantial question that stands to be decided in the present appeal is whether the Community is a farmer within the meaning of the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act and, as such, entitled to a proposal for a composition of its liabilities under the provisions of that Act.\nWhen once this point is settled, there will have to be examined the further question whether the respondent Board established under the Act is authorized and empowered and has jurisdiction to hold a hearing, or to formulate a proposal for a composition of the liabilities of the respondent Community.\nIf these two questions be disposed of in accordance with the contentions of the appellant, there will remain to be decided whether the County Court is vested with the exclusive jurisdiction to pass upon these questions, subject to appeal as provided in sec. 174 of the Bankruptcy Act, or if the appellant's action was competently brought before the Supreme Court of British Columbia; and, in such a case, whether the jurisdiction of that Court should have been exercised in a declaratory action such as was instituted here, or whether the intervention of the Supreme Court could be asked for only by petition for a writ of certiorari.\nI will deal first with the question whether, on the evidence before the Court, the respondent Community can be held to be a farmer within the meaning of the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act.\nThe Christian Community of Universal Brotherhood is a limited company incorporated by letters patent under the Dominion Companies Act on April 25th, 1917, with a capital stock of $1,000,000 divided into 10,000 shares of $100 each.\nIts powers and objects are those usually granted to an ordinary commercial corporation. The Charter contains no reference to any religious beliefs, practices, or observances.\nSome of the objects and powers of the Company are as follows:\n(a) To carry on agricultural pursuits, and to manufacture the products of the farm, the mine, the soil and the forest; to manufacture, purchase or otherwise acquire, to hold, own, sell, assign and transfer or otherwise dispose of, to invest, trade, deal in and deal with, either at retail or wholesale, goods, wares and merchandise, and real and personal property, corporeal and incorporeal, of every class and description whatsoever and whatsoever required; to grow, produce, manufacture, buy, sell, trade, deal in and deal with raw materials, live stock, grains, fruits, agricultural products and all other products and by-products of the soil, the forest, the mine, the lakes and rivers; including among others the raising, buying, selling, trading in and dealing with cattle, sheep, horses and live stock of every kind, and to manufacture any and all materials, goods, products and merchandise of any and every kind from any of the foregoing;\n(e) To distribute any of the property of the company in specie among the members;\n(f) To promote freedom of contract, and to resist, insure against, counteract and discourage interference therewith, and to subscribe to any association or fund for any such purposes;\n(g) To distribute any of the assets for the time being of the company among the members in kind, and to stipulate for and obtain for the members, or any of them any property, rights, privileges or options;\n(h) To carry on any other business (whether manufacturing or otherwise) which may seem to the company capable of being conveniently carried on in connection with the above or calculated directly or indirectly to enhance the value of or render profitable any of the company's property or rights;\n(k) To enter into partnership or into any arrangement for sharing of profits, union of interests, co-operation, joint adventure, reciprocal concessions or otherwise, with any person or company carrying on or engaged in or about to carry on or engage in any business or transaction which the company is authorized to carry on or engage in, or any business or transaction capable of being conducted so as directly or indirectly to benefit the company; and to lend money to, guarantee the contracts of, or otherwise assist any such person or company, and to take or otherwise acquire shares and securities of any such company, and to sell, hold, re-issue, with or without guarantee, or otherwise deal with the same;\n(t) To procure the company to be registered and recognized in any foreign country and to designate persons therein according to the laws of such foreign country to represent this company and to accept service for and on behalf of the company of any process or suit;\n(w) To sell, improve, manage, develop, exchange, lease, enfranchise, dispose of, turn to account or otherwise deal with all or any part of the property and rights of the company;\n(x) To do all or any of the above things in any part of the world and as principals, agents, contractors or otherwise, and by and through agents or otherwise, and either alone or in conjunction with others;\nThe incorporators of the Company were nine individuals: Two farmers, a clerk, a carpenter, an accountant, a fruit dealer, a housekeeper, a gardener and a contractor. These nine individuals were among those subsequently appointed permanent directors of the Company.\nAfter its incorporation, the Community purchased from Peter Verigin, one of its directors, certain city, town and farm lands and certain property in the provinces of British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Alberta for $600,000, paid for by the allotment to each of the twelve directors of the Company of 500 fully paid up shares. Prior to the purchase of these properties, the same were occupied by members of an unincorporated association commonly called The Doukhobors, for whom Peter Verigin held the same in trust.\nThe lands acquired from Verigin were registered in the name of the incorporated company (the respondent Community).\nThe lands so owned by the Community represented over 60,000 acres of land in British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Alberta, although in Alberta the lands there owned were registered in the name of a wholly subsidiary company: The Christian Community of Universal Brotherhood of Alberta Limited.\nWhile a large part was farm land, the respondent Community also owned city and town property and industrial sites, from the rental of which revenues were derived.\nThe business of the Community in British Columbia, with which we are more directly concerned, included logging, milling of various products, the operation of a flour mill, the manufacture and selling of jam, the operation of a brick yard and the operation of several general stores.\nThe relative importance of these separate operations appears from an examination of the balance sheets of the Community. For example, the Community balance sheet as of December 31st, 1928, shows, under the heading of \"Received Assessment from Members of Community\" rents in British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan totalling $333,948.50. The profit and loss account headed \"British Columbia Industry\u2014Commercial Branch\" shows a total of over $1,000,000, and the statement of profit and loss headed \"Saskatchewan Industry\u2014Commercial Branch\" shows a total of over $230,000.\nThe balance sheet as of December 31st, 1938, shows assets in excess of $5,300,000 and liabilities of a little over $860,000. Among the latter liabilities are shown $340,000 owing to individual Doukhobors or Community Groups of Doukhobors.\nWhile the respondent Community owned farm lands, it did not operate the farms itself, but rented the land to individual or to groups of Doukhobors. The rent was paid to the Community in the form of assessments, which were made \"according to the quality of the land.\"These assessments were paid, whether the farms rented were or were not under cultivation, and without consideration to the value of the products. At all events, the products belonged to the individuals or the groups who were working the farm and did not belong to the Community.\nThe Debentures Holders' action was for the recovery of the amount outstanding on a bond issue of $350,000 secured by a deed of trust and mortgage in favour of the appellant, executed on December 3rd, 1925; and, at the time of the purported proceedings under the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, the deed of trust and mortgage to the appellant covered all the property and assets of the Community of whatsoever kind and wheresoever situate.\nThe mortgage and claim of the appellant had and has priority over the claims of all other creditors of the Community and is a direct charge upon all its properties and assets.\nUnder the above circumstances, can it be said that the Community is a farmer within the definition of the Act (c. 53 of the Statutes of Canada, 1934, s. 2f)?\nUnder that definition, a farmer is \"a person whose principal occupation consists in farming or the tillage of the soil.\"\nWhether a person comes under that definition is almost exclusively a question of fact; and the learned trial judge has held that the Community was not a farmer, at least within the meaning so defined.\nIt seems clear that, so far as lands were concerned, the Community was in the position of a landlord or vendor. The \"farming or the tillage of the soil\" was done by the individuals or the groups who paid the assessments to the Community.\nIt need not be repeated here that a limited company is an entity separate from its component members (Salomon v. Salomon [11]; Macaura v. Northern Assurance Company[12] ; Pioneer Laundry v. Minister of National Revenue[13] ). The Community never worked the farm lands itself. It rented them out to the members of the unincorporated Christian Community of Universal Brotherhood and received from their members who leased the lands an annual assessment which, to all intents and purposes, was a rental. On this point, the evidence, both documentary and verbal, is conclusive and fully warrants the holding of the trial judge. Indeed, the Community itself did not contend at the trial that the farming was being carried on by it. Particularly after the year 1926, the Community confined its endeavour in British Columbia to logging, milling forest products, manufacturing and selling jams and operating stores. Neither was it doing any farming in Alberta or Saskatchewan. Farm lands in Saskatchewan were all sold in 1928.\nIt is apparent from the \"statement of affairs\" accompanying the proposal made by the Community and filed with the Official Receiver that the Community itself hired no labour. All the work was done by families on the land. No record of the crop raised on the lands was kept by the Community; it was \"kept by each individual on land to whom the Corporation made assessments annually.\" In fact, the Community had no knowledge of what the crop record was, since the crops belonged to the individuals.\nIn view of these facts, it does not seem possible to reverse the finding of fact of the trial judge that the respondent Community was not a farmer, and, more particularly, that it was not \" a person whose principal occupation consisted in farming or the tillage of the soil,\" as defined in s. 2f of the Act.\nThe decision of this Court in the Barickman case [14] is, of course, authority for the principle that the definition of \"farmer\" in the Act may include a body corporate and politic and a corporation of such a nature as that of the Barickman Hutterian Mutual Corporation. In that case, such inclusion was said to be justified by the definitions of the words \" person \" and \" corporation \" in the Bankruptcy Act (s. 2cc and s. 2k ) which are brought into the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act by s. 2 (2) of the latter Act, and also by the fact that, on consideration of the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act such inclusion is consistent with and not obnoxious to the provisions and objects of that Act.\nBut an examination of the nature and the methods of operation of the respondent Community with those under consideration in the Barickman case[15] shows that there was no comparison between the two, in so far as the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act may be made to apply to each of them. There is no similarity between the two corporations.\nThe member of the Hutterian corporation can own nothing and does not own anything. He is, at best, an employee of the Hutterian corporation working for his board and lodging, not even in the ordinary position of a hired man on a farm who, in addition to board and lodging, would receive wages as his own. The farming operations are the operations of the Hutterian corporation and the crops are theirs.\nThe position of the Hutterian is very fully described by the Chief Justice of Canada in the Barickman case[16].\nThe respondent Community is an entirely different organization. In so far as lands are concerned, it is, in fact, like an ordinary land or real estate company leasing or selling its lands to others; and, so far as its other activities are concerned, it is like any other commercial corporation carrying on certain commercial undertakings and industries, such as stores, jam factories, saw mills, planing mills, brickyards, etc. In this case, as already stated, the individual or the group is the farmer. He is not a hired man; but he works for himself and he pays rent to the Community. If he happens to work in a store, factory, or saw mill belonging to the Community, he is paid wages. When he sells his fruit to the jam factory, he is paid for it. He is an independent tenant or owner; and when he harvests his crops the proceeds are his.\nHe can, and apparently does, accumulate large sums of money for, among the creditors of the Community, as appears by the \" Statement of Affairs\" filed with the proposal, there are a large number of Doukhobors with claims amounting to two\u2014thirds of the total indebtedness of the Community, or over $342,000.\nThe Doukhobor, therefore, is the owner of wealth; he accumulates money and property and lends it to the Community, while the Hutterian can and does own nothing. The latter works without wages and entirely for the Corporation. It need not be said that the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act does not concern itself with the landlord or the vendor, but only with the actual farmer\u2014the man on the land. The farmers are those whom \"it is important to retain on the land as efficient producers\" or, in this case, the individual Doukhobors, the men who farm, and not their landlord or vendor, the respondent Community. If the foreclosure action of the appellant be proceeded with and maintained, the farmer on the land in the present case will not be put off, he will merely change his landlord.\nIt seems that, for the purpose of ascertaining whether the respondent Community can be classed as a farmer within the meaning of the Act, the facts, in the premises, clearly distinguish this case from the Barickman case [17].\nThe learned trial judge held that, in view of all the circumstances, the Community was not a farmer; and I am unable to think of any reason why his finding should be disturbed.\nWe now come to the point whether, in the circumstances, the respondent Board established under the Act is authorized and empowered and has jurisdiction to hold a hearing or to formulate a proposal for the composition of the liabilities of the respondent Community.\nIn discussing this point, it is necessary to bear in mind that the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, envisaged as the exercise of the jurisdiction ot the Parliament of Canada, finds its justification, so far as legislative competency is concerned, on the ground that it is legislation dealing with insolvency and bankruptcy (Reference re Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act [18]; Attorney-General for British Columbia v. Attorney-General for Canada [19]). It follows that the jurisdiction conferred by that Act upon the Official Receiver and the Board of Review must be strictly confined within the sphere of the Act for the dual reason that, unless so confined, and if the case under discussion fails to come within it, the result would be not only that the Receiver or the Board do not establish a foundation for their jurisdiction, but the matter itself would have to be regarded as beyond the competency of the Dominion Parliament and ipso facto would cease to have any effective operation. We must, therefore, start from the point that, before the Act can be entered into at all, the applicant of a proposal for a composition or scheme of arrangement must be \"a farmer who is unable to meet his liabilities as they become due\" (s. 6 of the Act). Unless these conditions exist, not only is the Act not applicable, but it could not have been competently enacted by the Dominion Parliament.\nAssuming, however, that we have a farmer who is unable to meet his liabilities as they become due, the latter is entitled, under the Act, to make a proposal which shall be filed with an Official Receiver. It is then the duty of such Official Receiver forthwith to convene a meeting of the creditors and perform the duties and functions required by the Bankruptcy Act to be performed by a trustee in the case of a proposal for a composition, extension of time, or scheme of arrangement.\nOn the filing of a proposal with the Official Receiver, no creditor shall have any remedy against the property or the person of the debtor, or shall commence, or continue, any proceedings under the Bankruptcy Act, or any action, execution or other proceedings for the recovery of a debt provable in bankruptcy, or the realization of any security, unless with leave of the court and on such terms as the court may impose (s. 11-1).\nOn a proposal being filed, the property of the debtor is deemed to be under the authority of the court, pending the final disposition of any proceedings in connection with the proposal (sec. 11-2).\nIf the proposal filed with the Official Receiver fails to receive the approbation of the creditors, and the Official Receiver so reports, it is then that, on the written request of a creditor or of the debtor, the Board endeavours to formulate an acceptable proposal to be submitted to the creditors and the debtor, and the Board shall consider representations on the part of those interested (sec. 12-4). If the proposal formulated by the Board is approved by the creditors and the debtor, it is filed in the court and becomes binding on all the creditors and on the debtor. If the creditors or the debtor decline to approve the proposal, the Board may nevertheless confirm the proposal, either as formulated or as amended by the Board. In that case, it is filed in the court and becomes binding on all the creditors and on the debtor as in the case of the proposal accepted by the creditors and approved by the court (ss. 12-5 and 12-6).\nCertain rules, regulations and forms under the Act were made by the Governor General in Council pursuant to sec. 15 of the Act, and became effective on June 1st, 1935.\nUnder them, a farmer who is unable to meet his liabilities as they become due and who intends to make a proposal must, at the time when he asks for a convening of the meeting of his creditors, lodge with the Official Receiver a true statement of his affairs in the prescribed form, verified by statutory declaration. That statement must include a list of his creditors, with their addresses and the amount due to each of them; it must state for what purpose the debt was incurred; and it must contain a list of the assets of the farmer, an estimate of their productive value and of the present and prospective capacity of the farmer to meet his obligations, together with any corroborative evidence of the value which the farmer may furnish. The proposal must be in writing and signed by the farmer or his duly authorized agent.\nCertain rules are prescribed for convening the meetings of creditors, the procedure at those meetings and the proportion of the number of creditors which are to form the majority required to carry a proposition or a decision at such meetings.\nCertain other rules are prescribed to regulate the procedure if the proposal filed with the Official Receiver fails to receive the required approval of the creditors; and an application is made to him by the farmer, or any creditor, requesting the review by the Board.\nThe only other regulation to which it is necessary to refer is rule no. 42, whereby\nThe Official Receiver may, in the case either of a proposal, assignment, or receiving order, apply to the court for directions.\nThe perusal of the material sections of the Act and of the rules and regulations made thereunder fails, therefore, to disclose any jurisdiction vested in the Board of Review, except to formulate a fresh proposal upon the written request of a creditor or of the debtor, where the Official Receiver has reported \"that a farmer has made a proposal, but that no proposal has been approved by the creditors.\"\nThe Board may formulate the new proposal; it may amend it; and, if approved by the creditors and the debtor, it is then filed in court and becomes binding on the debtor and all the creditors; or if the creditors or the debtor decline to approve the same, the Board may nevertheless confirm it, in which case it is filed in court and becomes binding upon all the creditors and the debtor.\nThe Board may, upon receiving a request to formulate a proposal, direct any one or more of its members on its behalf to investigate any or all circumstances and report to the Board. The Board must base its proposal upon the present and prospective capacity of the debtor to perform the obligations prescribed and the prospective value of the farm; and, for the purposes of the performance of its duties and functions, the Board has the powers of a commissioner appointed under the Inquiries Act.\nFinally, the Board may decline to formulate a proposal in any case where it considers it cannot do so in fairness and justice to the debtor or the creditors.\nThe powers above mentioned are all enumerated in s. 12 of the Act and its subsections. It will be seen that they have to do with the inspection and investigation of all the circumstances surrounding the solvency of the farmer, his present and prospective capability to meet his liabilities and to perform his obligations, the productive value of his farm, and the formulation of a proposal based upon these several considerations which can be made consistently with all fairness and justice to the debtor or the creditors.\nBut nowhere is there to be found vested in the Board of Review the power to determine as a question of law the applicability of the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act to a person whose quality and status as a \"farmer\" is disputed, or where it is objected, by some party having an interest in the matter, that the applicant for a proposal does not come within the definition of the Act.\nThat the applicant should be a farmer to whom the Act applies is a condition precedent to the validity of a request that the Board should endeavour to formulate a proposal and is a prerequisite of its competency in the matter. The consequence must be that, if such a request is made to a Board of Review and if the status of the farmer in respect to whom a proposal is requested from the Board, either by one of the creditors, or by the debtor, be disputed, it is not within the province of the Board to decide that dispute; and the courts of justice are the proper forum where the matter must be debated and determined.\nBy force of subs. 4 of s. 12 of the Act, it is only upon the report of the Official Receiver \" that a farmer has made a proposal\" and the proposal has not been approved by the creditors, that the jurisdiction of the Board begins, at the written request of a creditor or of the debtor, and that jurisdiction is confined to the matters stated in the Act and analysed above.\nIt should only be added that, of course, the Official Receiver himself has no authority to decide whether the person filing the proposal is a \" farmer who is unable to meet his liabilities\" within the meaning of the legislation, if that point be disputed by the interested parties; and, in that case, the Receiver should avail himself of the provision contained in rule 42, whereby he may \"apply to the court for directions.\"\nNow, the Court referred to in the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act and upon whom jurisdiction is conferred by the Act, in the case of an assignment, petition, or proposal of the nature contemplated by the Act is, by s. 5,\nin the province of Quebec, the Superior Court of the judicial district where the farmer resides, and, in the other provinces, the county or district court.\nSection 5, however, enacts that the courts so designated\nshall have exclusive jurisdiction in bankruptcy subject to appeal, as provided in section 174 of the Bankruptcy Act.\nThis provision means that an order or decision of the court competently made under s. 5 may, under certain conditions, be appealed to the appeal court, and therefrom to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nSection 5 further provides that the Superior, County, or District Court judge, acting under it,\nshall exercise the powers vested in the Registrar by s. 159 of the Bankruptcy Act.\nIf we refer to s. 159, we find that the Registrars of the Superior Courts exercising bankruptcy jurisdiction have power and jurisdiction, subject to the General Rules limiting the power conferred by that section, (a) to hear bankruptcy petitions and to make receiving orders and adjudications thereon, where they are not opposed;\n(b) to hold examinations of debtors;\n(c) to grant orders of discharge, where the application is not opposed;\n(d) to approve compositions, extensions, or schemes of arrangement, where they are not opposed;\n(e) to make interim orders in case of urgency;\n(f) to make any order, or exercise any jurisdiction which by any rule in that behalf is prescribed as proper to be made or exercised in chambers;\n(g) to hear and determine any unopposed or ex parte application;\n(h) to summon and examine any person known or suspected to have in his possession effects of the debtor, or to be indebted to him, or capable of giving information respecting the debtor, his dealings or property;\n(i) to hear and determine appeals from the decision of the trustee allowing or disallowing a creditor's claim, where such claim does not exceed five hundred dollars.\nThere are, therefore, two important points to be borne in mind with regard to s. 5, and they are:\n1. That the exclusive jurisdiction conferred upon the court therein designated is a \"jurisdiction in bankruptcy\"; and\n2. That the powers vested in the court as a result of the inclusion of s. 159 of the Bankruptcy Act are, generally speaking, powers limited to matters and applications ex parte, or \"not opposed.\"\nIt follows that the court specified in s. 5 cannot rely on its powers under s. 159 of the Bankruptcy Act to found jurisdiction upon the questions we are now discussing, for the appellant clearly denies the status of \" farmer\" to the respondent Community and opposes its right to make a proposal under the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act; and, indeed, it urges that the Act is not in any way applicable to this particular Community.\nIf, therefore, it is contended that, in the province of British Columbia, a county or district court alone and exclusively has jurisdiction in respect to the questions of status raised in the present case, such contention must rely on the first paragraph of s. 5, whereby a wider jurisdiction is conferred upon these courts, subject to appeal as therein stated.\nBut, in s. 5, the enactment is that the courts there mentioned \" shall have exclusive jurisdiction in bankruptcy.\" The insertion of the words \" in bankruptcy\" cannot be taken to have been made without object. According to the interpretation section of the Act (s. 2), for the purposes of this legislation, the word \" 'court' means the court having jurisdiction under the Act\"; and it would follow that wherever in the successive sections of the Act, reference is in terms made to \" the Court,\" it means that jurisdiction on the particular matter mentioned in those sections is specifically vested either in the Superior Court, if the matter be in Quebec, or, if it be in the other provinces, it is vested in the county or district court. With regard to any matter specially dealt with in those sections, there can be no doubt as to where jurisdiction lies.\nBut, because of the qualifications implied in the addition of the word \"in bankruptcy,\" it is not as easy to define the jurisdiction conferred upon these courts by the first paragraph of s. 5.\nIt is clear that the \" court\" mentioned in ss. 6a, 8, 10, 10a, 11, 12, and such other sections where a similar reference is made, and equally the \" court\" mentioned in the rules and regulations and, in particular, in regulation no. 42, or in form C and, for that, generally speaking, in the other forms in the appendix to the rules and regulations, is intended to designate the Superior Court in Quebec and the county or district court in the other provinces. It is not as evident that the latter courts are given exclusive jurisdiction on all other matters having relation to the application and the administration of the Act.\nIf the status as such of an alleged farmer making a proposal for a composition, extension of time, or scheme of arrangement and filing it with the Official Receiver is put in question by an interested party, the Official Receiver deeming it necessary or opportune to \" apply to the court for directions \" will, of course, by force of rule 42, apply in British Columbia to the County or District Court of the judicial district where the farmer resides; but the question in the present case is whether, assuming the interested party himself of his own initiative decides to contest the status of the applicant as farmer and to dispute the latter's right to make a proposal under the Act, he will necessarily have to institute his proceedings in the County or District Court; and whether he is deprived of the right- which he would otherwise have in ordinary cases\u2014of invoking the general jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the province.\nThe words \"jurisdiction in bankruptcy\" are, of course, well known to Canadian bankruptcy law. They can be found throughout the interpretation clause and the several sections of the Bankruptcy Act. It would seem that the court which is invested with original jurisdiction in bankruptcy under the latter Act is given the competency to decide such questions, amongst others, as the following: whether a debtor has committed an act of bankruptcy; whether the person presenting a bankruptcy petition to the court is a creditor within the meaning of the Act, whether the debtor is able to pay his debts, whether an insolvent debtor may make an assignment of all his property for the general benefit of his creditors instead of being subject to a receiving order, whether a proposal made by an insolvent debtor should be approved or refused and upon what terms, whether an order already made should be reviewed, rescinded or varied.\nAs the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act may be regarded as a chapter of the Bankruptcy Act, as that Act\nshall be read and construed as one with the Bankruptcy Act *** and the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act and Bankruptcy Rules shall, except as in that Act provided, apply mutatis mutandis in the cases hereunder, including meetings of the creditors\n(sec. 2, subs. 2), I think I may conclude that the status of a farmer and the question whether he is entitled to invoke the benefit of the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act are included within the words \"jurisdiction in bankruptcy\" and that, therefore, these matters, under the Act, are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Superior Court in Quebec and of the County and District Court in the other provinces.\nIt does not necessarily follow, however, that the Supreme Courts of these provinces are divested by the Act of their supervisory authority over an official such as the Official Receiver or a board such as the Board of Review with which we are now dealing.\nIt may be a question whether the Parliament of Canada may oust the Supreme Court of a province of that well recognized jurisdiction; but that jurisdiction is exercised through the writs of prohibition, mandamus, or certiorari and that question does not arise in this case as none of those writs were resorted to here.\nThe appellant contends that it may also be exercised by declaration and injunction.\nIt need only be mentioned that the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act does not purport to exclude the jurisdiction of a provincial Supreme Court through one of these proceedings, except in so far as it may be implied from the use in sec. 5 (1) of the words \"exclusive jurisdiction.\" The extent of that implication may be left for wider examination in a case where the point comes up squarely for decision.\nIn the premises, the situation as it presents itself, is that, as a matter of fact, two county courts in British Columbia, the county court of Yale, holden at Penticton, June 26th, 1929, and the county court of West Kootenay, holden at Nelson, June 28th, 1929, have issued orders\nthat the said Christian Community of Universal Brotherhood Limited is hereby permitted to make application and is entitled to take advantage of the said Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, 1934, and amendments thereto (and) that the said Official Receiver, Walter Gordon Wilkins, is hereby permitted to accept the said proposal of the Christian Community of Universal Brotherhood Limited under the said Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, 1934, and amendments thereto.\nIt was explained that the Official Receiver deemed it more prudent to apply to two courts on account of the doubt which existed as to within which judicial district the respondent Community could be said to have its \"residence.\"\nThe Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, in the case of Kettenbach Farms' Ltd v. Henke[20], relying on the decision of the Privy Council in Board v. Board [21], and quoting from it the statement:\nNothing shall be intended to be out of the jurisdiction of a Superior Court, but that which specially appears to be so,\nheld that a Superior Court has always a supervisory authority over inferior courts and over tribunals which are not judicial, for the purpose of seeing that they do not go beyond their jurisdiction, unless such authority is taken away by competent legal authority.\nChief Justice Harvey, delivering the judgment of the Alberta Court, added: There is no suggestion in the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, 1934, or any other Act to which our attention has been directed, that the Board of Review is not to be subject to such supervisory authority; and, in view of the multitude of cases that come before it, it naturally must proceed generally upon a simple prima facie case of jurisdiction being established; and no special provision is made in the Act for the disposition of a contest on the point.\nWith due respect, it would appear that section 5 of the Act was there overlooked, as it can hardly be contended that the courts named in that section are not given the required authority to dispose of a contest of the character contemplated.\nSuch was the decision of the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan in the case of Great West Assurance Company v. Beck[22]. It was held there that the district judge has jurisdiction to determine whether a debtor who has made a proposal to the Official Receiver under the Act is a \"farmer\" within the meaning of that Act; and that a creditor, in applying under sec. 11 (1) of the Act for leave to proceed, may properly and conveniently do so on the ground that the debtor who has filed the proposal is not a \"farmer.\"\nIn that case, the language of section 12 (4) of the Act was pointed to; and it was said that that\nlanguage implies that the question of whether or not a debtor who has made a proposal is a farmer should be determined before the Official Receiver reports to the Board of Review.\nThe same court, in Lefebvre v. Lefebvre[23], held that the discretion given by sec 11 to the district court judge to grant leave to a creditor to commence or continue proceedings against a debtor, after the latter has filed a proposal under the Act, is unfettered; and, although it was stated that such discretion should be exercised with the greatest of care, it was added however, that, when it has been exercised, it should not lightly be interfered with on appeal.\nI have already said that, in my view, the status of the applicant as a farmer must be determined, or accepted, at some point before the Official Receiver has become functus and before the jurisdiction of the Board can arise, because the Official Receiver has no authority to make a report to the Board unless that status exists (Samijama v. The King [24]), and it is undoubtedly within the spirit of the Act that the question of status should be decided by one of the courts named in sec. 5. It is a familiar principle that where a specific remedy is given, it excludes, generally speaking, a remedy of any other form than that given by the statute (See: Earl of Halsbury, L.C., in Pasmore v. Oswaldtwistle Urban Council [25])\nIn the Barickman case [26], the appeal was from a decision of a county court, on the question whether the applicant corporation could be considered as a \"farmer\" within the meaning of the Act, and it is significant that no, one questioned the jurisdiction of the county court judge to decide the point.\nIn Prudential Insurance Company of America v. Liboiron[27], the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan, in an ordinary action otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Court of King's Bench of that province, where the defendant moved to set aside the action on the ground that he had filed a proposal under the Act and the action was brought without the leave provided for by sec. 11 (1) of the Act having been obtained, held that the court had jurisdiction to inquire into and determine objections to the validity of the proposal, including the objections that the defendant was not a person authorized by the Act to make a proposal. There, it was decided that the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal was not excluded by sec. 5 (1) of the Act in the circumstances of that case, and that the onus was then on the defendant to show, not only that he had filed a proposal, but that he was a person authorized to do so, i.e., a farmer unable to meet his liabilities as they become due. The Court referred to National Trust Company v. Powers [28] and disagreed with Gaul v. Charbonneau [29] on the question of jurisdiction, though agreeing with the latter judgment on the question of onus.\nIn the Liboiron case[30],, the Court of Appeal held that, assuming the defendant to be a farmer, she had failed to discharge the onus of showing that she was entitled to file a proposal, viz.: one who was insolvent.\nIn the course of his judgment, Chief Justice Turgeon stated that there may be various reasons why a plaintiff may wish to proceed against a person who has filed a proposal. If his contention was, as it was there, that the defendant was not authorized by the Act to file such a proposal and that the proposal was, therefore, a nullity, two courses were open to him:\nHe may commence his action, as these plaintiffs have done, or take a further step in an action already commenced, leaving it to the defendant to move to set the proceeding aside. If the question of the defendant's status under the Act is determined in favour of the defendant, the action or other proceeding will, of course, be set aside. If the question is determined in favour of the plaintiff, he will be allowed to continue his action. This was the procedure followed in Ontario in National Trust Company v. Powers [31]and in Fofton v. Shantz [32].\nIncidentally, it may be pointed out that such was also the course followed in Diewold v. Diewold, decided by this Court[33].\nChief Justice Turgeon continued:\nBut the other course, the course of applying to the district court judge under s. 11 (1) before taking his action, or commencing his further proceeding, is also open to the plaintiff.\n***\nWhere, however, the right of the defendant to file a proposal is not questioned, and consequently the validity of the proposal is assumed, but the plaintiff believes that, for some reason, he ought to have leave to proceed against the respondent without waiting for the final disposition of the proposal, he must apply for such leave to the district court judge who, alone, has power to grant it. In such a case, an action commenced without such leave would of necessity be set aside.\nIf the above reasoning be applied to the appellant in the present case, it should be said that the appellant had two courses open to it: Either it should have applied to the county court for permission to continue its Debentures Holders' action already commenced, or it should have further proceeded with that action until the Community had applied to have it set aside on the ground that it had filed a proposal.\nBut there was not in the Liboiron case[34], as there is here, the feature that a county court had already given permission to the applicant and to the Official Receiver to proceed under the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act.\nI do not overlook the appellant's argument that, unless the applicant is a farmer, the Act has no application to him whatsoever, and anything which he purports to do under it, and any proposal made or filed by him is a nullity, and the jurisdiction of the Superior Courts is in no way interfered with.\nThe appellant's contention is that, until a proposal within the meaning of the Act is filed with the Official Receiver, the statute has not been taken advantage of and there is no foundation for any proceedings under it, and anything purported to be done under the Act is a nullity. It further says that the county courts' orders show on their face that no proposal had been filed with the Official Receiver at the time when they were made, as by these orders the respondent Community is permitted to make application under the Act and the Official Receiver permitted to accept the proposal.\nBut the point is that the scheme of the Act is to submit these questions to the decision of the courts named in sec. 5; and the legislature entrusted these courts with a jurisdiction which includes the jurisdiction to determine whether this preliminary set of facts existed, as well as the jurisdiction, on finding that it does exist, to allow the Receiver or the Board to proceed further or to do something more.\nIn the present case, however, there is a special situation. As already stated, the appellant's Debentures Holders' action was instituted before the respondent Community applied to the Official Receiver under the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act and before the county court orders were issued.\nThe Debentures Holders' action is still pending; and the Receiver appointed in that action by the Supreme Court of British Columbia is still carrying on his duties. The effect of the Receiver's appointment by the Supreme Court was to put all the property and assets of the Community under the authority of that court. In such circumstances, its jurisdiction in respect of the assets of the respondent Community and with regard to the proceedings then pending before it could not be interfered with by the mere application of the Official Receiver to the county courts under the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act.\nOn the face of the orders issued by those courts, they were simply ex parte orders, without any of the material and pertinent facts being put before the county court judges and in the absence of all the other parties interested in the matter. Having regard to the particular situation, I entirely agree on this point with the reasoning and with the conclusion of my Lord the Chief Justice. It cannot be that the intention of Parliament was to give to the county court the competency to interfere with the possession of the Receiver appointed by the Supreme Court, which, in effect, would amount to an interference with the possession of the Supreme Court itself.\nIn the result, the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the trial judge should be restored with costs throughout.\nCROCKET J.\u2014This appeal arises out of an alleged proposal for a composition, extension of time or scheme of arrangement under the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, made by the respondent, the Christian Community of Universal Brotherhood, Limited, on June 23rd, 1939, and a later request, purporting to be made under the provisions of the said Act on August 1st, 1939, by one, Joseph Peter Shukin, \"the vice-president of the above mentioned farmer,\" to the Board of Review under the said Act to\nendeavour to formulate an acceptable proposal for a composition, extension of time or scheme of arrangement herein.\nThe appellant had commenced in the Supreme Court of British Columbia in May, 1938, a debenture holders' action against the respondent Community for a foreclosure or sale of certain property and assets of the Community mortgaged to the appellant on December 3rd, 1925, to secure a bond issue of $350,000 in respect of which the Community was then in default to the extent of $170,000. The writ in that action was issued on May 18th, 1938, in pursuance of leave granted by Manson J., and on the same day the Supreme Court by order of the same judge appointed a receiver of all the undertaking and property and assets of the defendant comprised in and subject to the said deed of trust and mortgage, to whom the same was ordered to be forthwith delivered, subject to permission to the defendant to carry on under the supervision of such Receiver the ordinary businesses of its general stores, flour mills, jam factory, brickyard and sawmills and planing mills in British Columbia, with liberty to the defendant and the Receiver to apply to that court for directions from time to time. That action was pending and the Receiver, one G. L. Salter, a chartered accountant and authorized trustee in bankruptcy, was acting as an officer of the Supreme Court of British Columbia therein for the purpose of enforcing the security created by the respondent corporation's deed of trust and mortgage, when the latter filed its alleged proposal on June 23rd, 1939, with the Official Receiver under the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act for the judicial district in which presumably the Community had its residence and which, it may be inferred, included the counties of Yale and West Kootenay, as the judges of both these County Courts purported to have made analogous orders, one on June 26th, 1939, and the other on June 28th, 1939, upon the application of one Walter Gordon Wilkins, who is described therein simply as an Official Receiver under the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, purporting to permit the Community to make application under the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act and the said Official Receiver \"to accept the said proposal.\" Mr. Wilkins was asked by counsel for the respondent before the trial judge (Mr. Justice Robertson) if he could tell him\nWere these applications and orders made by Their Honours Judge Kelly and Judge Nesbitt at the time you had the application?\nto which he replied,\nWell, in answer to that I would say I received a tentative application to start with and during the course of a few weeks the order was built up and then I applied to Judge Kelly,\nand in cross-examination said that he could not tell whether he had given any notice of his application to either of the two County Court judges. I suppose from the record, as it comes to us, it must be taken that the Community's alleged proposal had been actually filed on June 23rd, notwithstanding that the orders of both County Court judges purported to permit the Community \"to make application under and is entitled to take advantage of the provisions of the said F.C.A. Act, 1934,\" and the said Official Receiver \"to accept the said proposal.\"\nIn any event, the Community filed its request to the Board of Review on August 1st, 1939, from which it must be assumed, if we are to have any regard for the provisions of the Act, that the Official Receiver had called a meeting of the interested creditors and submitted the proposal with the required statement of its affairs for their consideration, and that the proposal had not been approved, for there is in the record an exhibit, which purports to be a notice to Mr. Salter, the Receiver for the appellant Trust Company, that the Board would deal with the Community's written request for the formulation of \"an acceptable proposal for a composition, extension of time or scheme of arrangement of the affairs of the said farmer\" at the court house at Nelson, B.C., on September 26th, 1935, (which presumably is an error for 1939)\u2014which they could only do under the provisions of s. 12 in the event of the original proposal not having been approved by the creditors.\nThe appellant on September 16th, ten days before the time fixed for the hearing before the Board of Review, commenced this action in the Supreme Court of British Columbia against the Community and the Board, claiming a declaration that the Community was not a farmer within the meaning of the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act and that the Board of Review had no jurisdiction to take any proceedings or consider the request for the formulation of an acceptable proposal under that Act, and on the same date an interim injunction was granted restraining the defendants and each of them until the trial of the action or until further order from taking any further steps under the Act with respect to the applications or liabilities of the Community. This injunction was dissolved on October 20th, 1939, by Mr. Justice Fisher on the ground that it was premature, and on December 15th, 1939, Mr. Justice Robertson, who tried the action, gave judgment declaring that the respondent, the Christian Community of Universal Brotherhood, Limited, is not a farmer within the meaning of the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, statutes of Canada, 1934, ch. 53, as amended by statutes of Canada, 1935, ch. 20, and statutes of Canada, 1938, ch. 47, and giving liberty to apply for an injunction as against the Board of Review in the event of its deciding to proceed with the request for review. From this judgment both defendants appealed to the Court of Appeal, with the result that the appeal was allowed and the trial judgment set aside with costs.\nIt had been argued in behalf of the Community before the learned trial judge that the decision of this Court in Barickman Hutterian Mutual Corp. v. Nault[35] was conclusive upon the question of the Community being a farmer within the meaning of the Act. His Lordship, however, carefully compared the facts of that case with those of the present and pointed out that while the corporation in the Barickman case [36], as the owner of the farm lands, managed and directed the farming and owned all the produce of the farms, and that no one else had or could have any legal interest therein, in the present case it was the tenants of the Community, whose principal occupation was farming or the tillage of the soil, and not the corporation itself, and thus distinguished it from the case relied upon by the Community, and held that the decision of this Court in the former case could not be relied upon by the respondent corporation as an authority for its contention in the present action, and made the declaration prayed for that the Community was not a farmer within the meaning of the Act.\nMacdonald, C.J., in his reasons for judgment in the Court of Appeal, with which McQuarrie, J., agreed, adopted a dictum of Martin, J., in Great West Life Assurance Co. v. Beck [37], that whether or not a debtor, who has made a proposal, is a farmer should be determined before the Official Receiver reports to the Board of Review, and that if the Official Receiver was in doubt as to the status of the debtor, he might apply to the County Court judge for direction under rule 42 of the rules and regulations made by the Governor in Council under s. 15 of the Act, and he held that the County Court judge had jurisdiction to decide that question and that the above mentioned orders made by the two County Court judges were\nnot things of naught, whatever might be said of the right to vacate them by appropriate proceedings.\nIf he was wrong in this view, he added,\nand an action for a declaration as to whether or not the appellant Christian Community is a \"farmer\" may be maintained in the Supreme Court, I would say, with the greatest respect for any contrary views, on the authority of Barickman Hutterian Mutual Corp. v. Nault[38], that it is a \"farmer.\" This, of course, is the substantial question to be decided. O'Halloran, J., held that the order of the judge of the proper County Court was an order of a court of competent jurisdiction under the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, and that the Supreme Court of the province had no jurisdiction to ignore it or set it aside in a declaratory action.\nWith every respect, upon a consideration of the record and of the relevant provisions of the statute and regulations, I am of opinion that the learned trial judge had full jurisdiction to make the declaration which he did, and that his judgment was fully warranted by the evidence; and that the Court of Appeal therefore was not justified in setting it aside.\nAs its title, preamble and all its provisions and the rules and regulations thereunder clearly connote, the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act was designed by Parliament for the sole and exclusive benefit of farmers, who were unable to meet their liabilities as they became due. It is not questioned that no one, who was not a farmer within the definition prescribed by the Act (\"a person whose principal occupation consists in farming or the tillage of the soil\"), had any right to avail himself of its provisions to make a proposal either for a composition in satisfaction of his debts or an extension of time for payment thereof or a scheme of arrangement of his affairs, either by the Official Receiver or by the Board of Review. It seems to me, therefore, that if the respondent corporation was not a farmer, neither the Official Receiver nor the Board of Review nor either of the County Court judges had any authority whatsoever to bring the respondent corporation within the operation of that Act, and that any orders or reports purporting to recognize the respondent as a farmer must be held under the explicit provisions of the Act to have been wholly void and of no effect. The learned Chief Justice of British Columbia, pointing out that the two analogous orders of the County Court judges of the Counties of Yale and West Kootenay permitting the applicant to take advantage of the Act involves a decision that the applicant was a \"farmer,\" himself states that that is the only basis upon which the orders could be made; and, as I have already stated, that the question of whether the Community was a farmer, was the substantial question to be decided on the appeal to the Appeal Court. I cannot, therefore, upon my part, comprehend how, if the Community was not a farmer within the meaning of the Act, the fact that a County Court judge had without authority and erroneously found that the respondent corporation was a farmer can possibly have the effect of ousting the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to pronounce upon the validity of these proceedings and of removing from the custody and control of a special receiver appointed by the Supreme Court for the administration of the British Columbia assets and business of the respondent corporation for the realization of the moneys secured by the respondent's deed of trust and mortgage, and placing them in the exclusive control of either of the County Courts mentioned. The only possible construction of s. 6 of the Act, it seems to me, is that the right to make a proposal for a composition, extension of time or scheme of arrangement, is limited to a farmer, as above defined, and that the filing of a proposal by such a person with the Official Receiver is an essential pre-requisite of the jurisdiction of that official to act at all in any particular case in the same way that the filing of such a proposal is another essential pre-requisite under s. 11 (2) of the authority of any County Court in respect of the property of the appellant debtor.\nIn Toronto Railway Co. v. Corporation of the City of Toronto [39], an action had been brought by the railway company in the Supreme Court of Ontario for a declaration that the appellant's cars were personal property and as such were not liable for $8,775, sought to be levied as taxes thereon by the respondent. The trial court found that the plaintiff's cars were real estate and dismissed the action, and this judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. On appeal to the Privy Council the Board held that the cars formed no part of the railway and were not fixed in any way to anything which was real estate and were, therefore, not assessable under the Ontario Assessment Act. It was argued that the decision of the Court of Appeal was res judicata, the question having been decided by the Revision Court appointed under the provincial Assessment Act, and the County Court judge on appeal from that decision. The Judicial Committee rejected this contention on the ground that the jurisdiction of the County Court is confined to the amount of assess- ment and does not extend to validate an assessment unauthorized by the statute. Lord Davey in delivering the judgment of the Board said that the jurisdiction of the Court of Revision and of the courts exercising the statutory jurisdiction of appeal from the Court of Revision is confined to the question whether the assessment was too high or too low and that those courts had no jurisdiction to determine the question whether the assessment commissioner had exceeded his powers in assessing property which was not by law assessable.\nIn other words,\n(His Lordship continued)\nwhere the assessment was ab initio a nullity they had no jurisdiction to confirm it or give it validity.\nThe Board therefore advised His Majesty that the order of the Court of Appeal should be reversed and instead thereof a declaration should be made and an injunction granted as claimed by the statement of claim.\nIn Donohue v. The Parish of St. Etienne [40], which was an action before a Superior Court in the province of Quebec, under Article 50 C.C.P., to have the defendant's assessment roll declared null and void on the ground that it included the assessment of machinery as immovable property, this Court held that the plaintiff having been assessed for property, which was non-assessable under the Assessment Act, the valuation roll was void ab initio and that the case fell within the principle of the decision of the Privy Council in Toronto Railway Co. v. City of Toronto [41]. The appeal from the Court of King's Bench, reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, dismissing the plaintiff's action, was consequently allowed. In that case, Duff, J., as he then was, said that he could see no reason why the principle of the Toronto case was[42] not applicable and that there should be a declaration in accordance with the view above expressed, viz: that the machinery in question was not assessable as immovable property. Anglin and Mignault JJ., held that the decision of the Privy Council in Shannon Realties Ltd. v. Ville St. Michel [43] was not in point and that the failure of the appellants to proceed under articles 430 and 662 of the Municipal Code did not preclude their maintaining an action under article 50 C.C.P., in order to have the valuation roll declared null.\nIn the City of London v. Watt & Sons [44], this Court held that s. 65 of the Ontario Assessment Act (R.S.O., 1887, c. 193) does not enable the Court of Revision to make valid an assessment which the statute does not authorize. Taschereau C.J., in delivering the judgment of the Court, held that that section of the Ontario Assessment Act does not make the roll as finally passed by the Court of Revision conclusive as regards a question of jurisdiction.\nIf there is no power,\n(he said),\nconferred by the statute to make the assessment, it must be wholly illegal and void ab initio, and confirmation by the Court of Revision cannot validate it.\nIt is true that these three cases concern the exercise of statutory rights and powers provided for by provincial Assessments Acts, but if, as they all affirm, the unauthorized assumption of powers on the part of tribunals designated by such statutes makes their exercise null and void, and entitled the Supreme Courts of the provinces to try declaratory actions brought by those against whom it is sought to exercise such powers, why should the principles thus affirmed in these cases not apply similarly to the exercise of the explicitly limited rights and powers provided for by the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act? I can conceive of no reason why they should not. The whole tenor of the statute, it seems to me with all respect, negatives the suggestion that the Parliament of Canada intended to interfere with the inherent jurisdiction of the Supreme Courts of the various provinces to declare the nullity of wholly unauthorized proceedings and orders of all inferior statutory functionaries or tribunals at the suit of those whose property and civil rights such proceedings and orders purport to affect. I would, therefore, allow the appeal and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge with costs throughout against the respondent corporation.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Davis and Company.\nSolicitor for the respondent The Christian Community of Universal Brotherhood Limited: C.

Hazel Clow and Lucy Ada McKay (Defendants) Respondents.\n1941: May 16; 1941: October 7.\nPRESENT:\u2014Rinfret, Crocket, Davis, Hudson and Taschereau JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL IN EQUITY OF PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND.\nContract\u2014Suit to have conveyance and agreement set aside\u2014Alleged improvident transaction\u2014Relationship of parties\u2014Condition of health of grantor\u2014Circumstances prior to and at time of execution of documents\u2014Evidence\u2014Findings by trial judge\u2014Onus of proof as to full comprehension by grantor of what he was doing and as to pressure or undue influence\u2014Whether grantor's execution was spontaneous act with free and independent exercise of will.\nComplainant sued to have a deed of conveyance and an agreement, executed by him, set aside. The deed conveyed his farm to his daughter and her husband, reserving a life estate, without impeachment of waste, to complainant and his wife. By the agreement (of the same date as the deed), made by complainant and his wife of the first part and their daughter and her husband of the second part, complainant assigned to his daughter and her husband a one-half share of complainant's farm stock, implements, crops, furniture and other movables on the farm; the parties were to live together on the farm, as they had done theretofore, were to carry on farming operations jointly, to share equally expenses and profits; said daughter and her husband were to care for complainant and his wife during their lives, their support and maintenance to be from their share of profits and to be in a manner in keeping with the farm's earnings; and on the death of complainant and his wife or the survivor of them, all their interest in said farm stock, etc., were to belong to the daughter and her husband. Complainant alleged that the documents were executed by him in advanced age, at a time when he was infirm and of weak understanding and unable to resist the threats and importunities of defendants (complainant's wife, his daughter and her husband) or some or one of them; that they were executed without independent legal or other disinterested advice at a time when complainant was under defendants' influence; that they were executed improvidently, and without any power of revocation; that the consideration was grossly inadequate; and that the contents thereof did not express complainant's wishes. The trial judge made findings against complainant's contentions and dismissed the suit. 'His judgment was affirmed on appeal (on equal division of the court) and complainant appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Davis and Hudson JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed, and the deed and agreement cancelled.\nPer Rinfret, Crocket and Taschereau JJ.: Having regard to the evidence as to complainant's condition of health, the relationship of the parties, their feelings towards each other as shown by their conduct, and all the facts and circumstances leading up to and in connection with the execution of the documents, the documents, in their contents and effect, were such as to create doubt and suspicion as to their genuineness, so as to make it the duty of those who practically took the whole benefit there under to satisfy a court of equity that complainant not only fully comprehended what he was doing when he executed them but that he was not subjected to anypressure or undue influence in connection therewith; and the documents, read in the light of the evidence concerning the relations and feelings between the parties and the complainant's condition of health, did not show a fair and just and reasonable transaction on an equal footing, nor that complainant's execution of them was (as found by the trial judge) his \"spontaneous act with a free and independent exercise of his will,\" but pointed quite to the contrary conclusion.\nThe established rule of equity is that, whenever it appears that any party to a transaction, from which he or she derives some large or immoderate benefit, occupies such a position in relation to his or her supposed benefactor as to give the recipient a dominating influence over him, that benefit is presumed to have been obtained by the exercise of some undue influence on the part of the recipient. In all such cases, whatever be the nature of the transaction, whether a gift inter vivos or a contract alleged to have been made for a good and sufficient consideration, the onus of proof lies on the party who seeks to support it, to show that the transaction by which the benefit is granted was the free, independent and unfettered expression of the grantor's mind.\nPer Davis and Hudson JJ. (dissenting): It is unnecessary to decide whether the deed, in view of the collateral agreement, can strictly be said to be a voluntary conveyance to which the rule that the onus rests on the grantees to justify the transaction applies, because in both courts below the deed has been.treated as a voluntary conveyance and complainant has had whatever advantage there was in that interpretation. The case was essentially one of fact for the trial judge, who had the advantage, so important in a case of this sort, of seeing and hearing all the parties to the impeached transaction. To reverse his findings in such a case this Court should have to be convinced that he was wrong; and the evidence as a whole was far from convincing that there was any solid ground upon which this Court should interfere.\nAPPEAL by the complainant from the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Equity of Prince Edward Island affirming (on equal division of the Court) the judgment of the trial judge, Saunders J., Master of the Rolls, dismissing the complainant's suit, in which the complainant asked that a certain deed of conveyance of the complainant's farm to the defendants Clow (husband and wife, the latter being a daughter of complainant) (reserving a life estate without impeachment of waste to complainant and his wife), and also a certain agreement (of the same date as the deed) between the complainant and his wife (who was a defendant in the action) of the first part and the said defendants Clow of the second part, be set aside and cancelled; or in the alternative that said documents be reformed and rectified.\nThe formal judgment at trial adjudged and declared that the said deed of conveyance and agreement were established and were to stand as valid and subsisting (except that an amendment was directed in the habendum of the deed of conveyance, by striking out the words \" as joint tenants and not\" before the words \" as tenants in common,\" so that the defendants Clow be tenants in common and not joint tenants).\nThe facts in dispute sufficiently appear, and the documents in question are sufficiently described, in the reasons for judgment in this Court now reported. The appeal to this Court was allowed with costs, Davis and Hudson JJ. dissenting.\nJ. J. Johnston K.C. for the appellant.\nW. L. Scott K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the majority of the Court (Rinfret, Crocket and Taschereau JJ.) was delivered by\nCrocket J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Equity of Prince Edward Island, in a suit brought by the appellant, Willam N. McKay, by a bill of complaint in the Court of Chancery, praying that a deed of conveyance dated February 26th, 1936, from the complainant to the respondents, and an agreement of the same date between the same parties be set aside and cancelled, or in the alternative that the said deed and agreement be reformed and rectified, so as to express the true agreement between the parties concerned, and that the true intention of the appellant might be carried into effect.\nThe deed in question, which was executed by the complainant and his wife, of the first part, R. Reginald Bell, Barrister, of Charlottetown, of the second part, and J. Cameron Clow and G. Hazel Clow, his wife, of the third part, purported, in consideration of the sum of one dollar paid by the grantees to the grantor, William N. McKay, to grant unto the said Bell, his heirs and assigns, all the complainant's farm land situate at Murray Harbour North, on Lot 63, in King's County, containing 177 acres more or less, with all the rights, privileges, appurtenances, etc., belonging thereunto, to have and to hold the same unto the said Bell and his heirs, to the use of the said complainant and his wife\nfor and during the term of their and each of their natural lives without impeachment of waste, and from and after the decease of the said William N. McKay and Lucy Ada McKay or the survivor of them to the use of the said J. Cameron Clow and G. Hazel Clow, their heirs and assigns forever as joint tenants and not as tenants in common.\nThe complainant was the exclusive owner of the land described, his wife having no interest therein other than her right of dower, the barring of which was the apparent reason for her joining in the execution of the deed. J. Cameron Clow and G. Hazel Clow, upon whom the deed purports to bestow the remainder in fee simple as joint tenants, are husband and wife, the latter \"being the daughter of the complainant and his wife, to whose use for the term of their or each of their natural lives Mr. Bell and his heirs were to hold the granted land.\nThe agreement in question purported to assign and transfer to Clow and his wife a one-half share in all the farm stock and implements\nnow owned by the parties of the first part, including all horses, cattle, hogs, sheep, poultry, carts, wagons, sleighs, harness; agricultural, farming and dairy implements and machinery, and all crops now on said premises, and a one-half interest in all household furniture and other movables in, on and about said farm premises. The parties named therein as parties of the first part are the complainant and his wife, though admittedly all the property described in the agreement was also exclusively owned by the complainant himself, and his wife had no legal title thereto.\nThis agreement, which seems to have been executed immediately after the deed, recites that the said parties of the first part (the complainant and his wife) had\nin consideration of natural love and affection and for services rendered the said parties of the first part by deed of even date herewith granted their farm of one hundred and seventy-seven acres to the said parties of the second part, subject to a life interest in favour of the parties of the first part;\nthat the said parties had\nagreed to carrying on farming operations jointly on the said farm with equal rights and liabilities as to profits to be made and expenditures to be received [?];\nand that\nthe said parties of the first part have agreed to give to the parties of the second part a one-half interest in all the stock, crop, farming implements, household furniture and all other movables and equipment about and on the said premises.\nIt then proceeds to assign the one-half interest to Clow and his wife, as already stated, and to provide that\nthe parties hereto agree to carry on farming operations jointly so that all expenses incurred and expenditures made and all profits derived henceforth in connection with the carrying on of said farming operations shall be divided equally, share and share alike;\nthat\nall the parties hereto are to take part in the working and operation of the farm and to give all their time thereto and to work to the best of their ability for the successful operation of the farm and the mutual benefit of all concerned;\nthat Clow and his wife\nare to have a home in the dwelling on said premises and all the parties are to live together as heretofore;\nthat Clow and his wife\nare to care for the said parties of the first part during their lives and the life of the survivor, their support and maintenance to be from their share of profits of the farming operations and to be in a manner in keeping with the earnings of the farm;\nand that\non the death of the parties of the first part or the survivor of them, all the interest of the said parties of the first part in the stock, crop, implements, furniture and other movables shall thenceforth belong to the parties of the second part. The bill of complaint alleged, interalia, that for many years previous to the execution of the deed and agreement the complainant resided with his wife and daughter on the said farm; that for some years previous to the execution of the said documents the complainant was physically and mentally ill and compelled to undergo treatment at the hospital for his physical and mental ailments and continued under these disabilities for a long period of time; that during this period of illness Clow married his daughter, Hazel, and came to live with his wife on the said farm; that at the time of the execution of these documents and for a considerable period preceding same the complainant was very ill and greatly deranged in his mind and altogether unable to transact business; that the defendants, taking advantage of his helpless physical and mental condition, kept importuning him to make over his property to them so that they would have the ownership, management and control of the same; that the complainant finally agreed with the defendants that he and Clow should carry on the operations of the farm jointly, and that there should be an equal division of the net profits of the farm between himself on the one part and the defendants on the other, and that the complainant would pay half the expenses and the defendants the other half of the expenses of running the farm and household, but that he never agreed to give any of the defendants any interest or ownership, present or future, in the farm or the stock, crop, farming implements, furniture or other personal property in and about the farm. The bill of complaint further alleged that the deed and agreement were executed by the complainant in advanced age at a time when he was infirm and of weak understanding and unable to resist the threats and importunities of the three defendants or some or one of them; that they were executed without independent legal or other disinterested advice at a time when the complainant was under the influence of the defendants; also that they were executed improvidently and without any power of revocation; that the consideration was grossly inadequate; and that the documents were prepared by solicitors selected and paid by the defendants, who gave the instructions for same without any consent on the part of. the complainant, and the contents of which did not express the wishes or desires of the complainant. The appellant at the time of the execution of the documents was in his seventieth year and his wife a few months older. They had been married upwards of fifty years and had three daughters, of whom Hazel was the youngest. The other two were married and were living in the United States with their husbands and children. Clow married Hazel in September, 1930, when, it seems, he was 34 and she 28, after a courtship of about four years, and went at once to live with her parents on the farm at Murray Harbour North, which had been the home of the appellant through his whole married life, though originally it was a farm of but 77 acres, on which his father and grandfather had lived before him. He and Hazel continued to make their home there until the execution of the deed and agreement referred to, and have since done so, as have, also both Mr. and Mrs. McKay, except for a visit of a few weeks, which Mr. McKay himself made to his oldest daughter, Mrs. French, at Medford, Mass., in 1936.\nThe suit came on for trial before Mr. Justice Saunders, Master of the Rolls, in December, 1938. The trial judgment, delivered October 2nd, 1939, directed an amendment of the deed of conveyance by striking out the words \" as joint tenants and not\" in the habendum thereof, and adjudged and declared that in all other respects the said deed should stand as a valid and subsisting conveyance to the uses and purposes therein mentioned, and also that the agreement made between the complainant and his wife, of the first part, and the defendants, J. Cameron Clow and G. Hazel Clow, his wife, of the second part, on the same date, stand as a valid and subsisting agreement between the parties thereto.\nThe complainant thereupon appealed to the Court of Appeal in Equity, consisting of Chief Justice Mathieson and the Vice-Chancellor, Mr. Justice Arsenault. The Chief Justice gave judgment in favour of dismissing the appeal, simply stating in doing so that he agreed with the reasons of the Master of the Rolls, as set forth in his judgment. The Vice-Chancellor, on the contrary, was of the opinion that the appeal should be allowed and that there should be a decree that the deed be declared void and delivered up to be cancelled. The two judges in appeal having thus differed in opinion, the judgment of the Master of the Rolls was confirmed without costs. It is from this judgment that the complainant now appeals to this Court.\nIt is best, I think, first to deal with the construction and legal effect of the two impeached documents, the actual execution of which by all the parties thereto is not questioned.\nAs to the deed, which is under the Short Form Act (P.E.I. Statutes, 1894, Cap. XI), there can be no doubt that it evidences an intention on the part of the complainant\u2014provided he understood it and comprehended what he was doing when he executed it\u2014to irrevocably renounce his exclusive ownership and control of the described land and to make his wife a joint tenant thereof with him so long as both should live, and that, in the event of his death, his wife should continue to hold and enjoy the exclusive possession and control of the property until her own death, whereupon it should pass to the use of J. Cameron Clow and G. Hazel Clow, their heirs and assigns, forever, as joint tenants with right of survivorship. If valid, the deed conveys a present vested estate to the Clows, as well as to Mrs. McKay.\nHaving regard to the relationship of the parties and to the purpose for which and the consideration upon which it is now claimed the deed was executed, it is singular, to say the least, that it should state the consideration at one dollar paid by the grantees to the grantor, William N. McKay, and set out as well the usual covenants, warranting title, quiet possession, etc., and guaranteeing the execution of such further assurances of the said lands as may be necessary, as being entered into between \" the said grantor \" and \" the said grantees,\" (presumably the beneficial grantees), one of whom was \"the said grantor\" himself.\nAs for the collateral agreement, it is one which must be examined with the closest attention in the light of the relationship existing between the parties concerned and all the facts and circumstances leading up to and in connection with its execution, if its true import and effect as respects those who signed it is to be fully realized.\nThe agreement, if valid, at once vested in Clow and his wife the absolute ownership of an undivided one-half share in all the live stock, farming and dairy implements and machinery, as well as all crops then on the farm premises, and in \"all household furniture and other movables in, on and about said farm premises\" with a covenant that on the death of the complainant and his wife, or the survivor of them, that the other one-half share in all the personal property specified shall \"thenceforth belong to \" them also. In addition to this, it provides that all four (the donors and the donees alike) shall \"carry on farming operations jointly,\" and that all expenses incurred and all profits derived henceforth in connection with such joint operation shall be divided equally, share and share alike, and also that all four shall \" take part in the working and operation of the farm,\" and \"give all their time thereto,\" and \" work to the best of their ability for the successful operation of the farm and the mutual benefit of all concerned.\" Furthermore, the agreement secures for Mr. and Mrs. Clow \" a home in the dwelling on said premises,\" in which \"all the parties are to live together as heretofore.\" It is difficult to discover in any of these provisions any benefit or advantage for the complainant (the owner of the property) as against Mr. and Mrs. Clow, which he had not enjoyed during the nearly five and one-half years he had provided a home and subsistence for them after their marriage, while both were supposed to be taking their proper part in the working of the farm with himself and his wife, unless it is to be inferred that during that period they had not in fact been doing so. And Clow himself admits that in the year 1935 it became his regular habit, after assisting in the morning milking, to leave the place for the day and not return until night, usually taking with him the automobile which Mrs. McKay gave his wife as a wedding gift. Apart from this the only obligation towards the complainant the agreement places on Clow and his wife is that which is expressed in its penultimate paragraph, viz.: that they \"are to care for the said parties of the first part during their lives and the life of the survivor,\"\u2014and this with the significantly drastic qualification that \"their support and maintenance [is] to be from their share of profits of the farming operations and to be in a manner in keeping with the earnings of the farm.\" Yet it has been suggested that this one-sided agreement constitutes in equity a good and sufficient maintenance agreement. With all due respect, it seems to me that the two instruments themselves betray such incongruities and inconsistencies as cannot fail to raise doubt and suspicion of their genuineness, and, having regard to the relationship of the parties, to make it the duty of those, who practically take the whole benefit thereunder, to satisfy a Court of Equity that the grantor or donor (or donors if the complainant's wife was in truth a donor as well as her husband), not only fully comprehended what he was doing when he executed the deed and agreement, but that he was not subjected to any pressure or undue influence at their hands in connection therewith.\nOne rather remarkable feature of the agreement is the joining of Mrs. McKay as a joint owner with the complainant of all the personal property, the one-half share of which it purports to assign, notwithstanding the undeniable fact, already pointed out, that she had no legal title, so far as the evidence discloses, to any part of it, unless her husband's joining with her in the execution of the agreement ipso facto made her a joint owner with him. Although she was obviously concerned in the other terms of the agreement regarding the joint operation of the farm by all four, and might, therefore, naturally be. expected to join in its execution, it can hardly be said, I think, that the fact of her being joined with her husband as parties of the first part itself, either made her a joint owner with her husband of all the stock, crop, farming implements, house-hold furniture and other personal property on or about the farm premises, or vested in her a distinct but undivided one-half share therein. It may be that, if the complainant at all comprehended the effect of what he was doing when he joined his wife in the execution of such a document, he would, as his counsel suggested, in strictness of law be estopped from afterwards claiming that his wife was not part owner of the personal estate, which she purported with him to assign, but that would not give her the right to represent herself, as she did, as part owner of all the personal estate, one-half of which she purported with her husband to assign to the parties of the second part (her son-in-law and daughter).\nAnother thing of marked significance about the agreement is that its first recital regarding the conveyance to Clow and his wife of the farm land and the consideration for that conveyance does not accord with the statement in the deed itself. The deed says that that conveyance was made in consideration of the sum of one dollar then paid by the grantees to the grantor, while the first recital of the agreement declares that it was \"in consideration of natural love and affection and for services rendered.\" This recital also alleges that the deed granted their farm (that is, Mr. and Mrs. McKay's farm) \"to the said parties of the second part,\" which is also a contradiction of the deed itself, and of the undisputed fact that the complainant was the exclusive and absolute owner thereof. Furthermore, the principal paragraph of the agreement, which purports to assign and transfer to the parties of the second part a one-half share in all the personal property therein specified, distinctly states that all this personality is \" now owned by the parties of the first part,\" and that the assignment is made \" in consideration of the premises [the three recitals already mentioned] and of the natural love and affection of the said parties of the first part for the parties of the second part.\"\nThe whole tenor of the agreement, when read with the deed and in the light of the entire testimony concerning the then existing relations between the parties and the complainant's physical and mental condition, far from showing a fair and just and reasonable transaction between the parties on an equal footing, and that the complainant's execution of the deed and agreement was his \"spontaneous act with a free and independent exercise of his will,\" as the learned trial judge has found, points, in my respectful opinion, quite to the contrary conclusion.\nManifestly the relations existing between the respective parties before and at the time of the critical transaction and their motives and feelings towards each other cannot be satisfactorily determined in a case of this kind solely by the impressions which they have succeeded or failed to make upon the mind of the trial judge as to their comparative cleverness, competence or credibility by their demeanour upon the witness stand more than two years after the consummation of the transaction. A witness's true feeling and intention towards another at any particular time can surely more safely be inferred from his proven or admitted acts and conduct towards that person before, at the time of and after the transaction under investigation. While in many cases such an issue may be said to be a pure question of fact dependent entirely upon the credibility of witnesses and in such cases the trial judge's finding would ordinarily be held to be conclusive in the absence of any misdirection or misapprehension on his part, the trial finding, upon which the respondents so much rely, is, in my humble opinion, one which must be carefully reviewed in the present appeal, if well known principles of law and equity are not to be ignored.\nThat finding involves not only the relations and feelings of the parties to and towards each other, but it involves the two written instruments and the righteousness and reasonableness of their terms in the light of those relations and feelings.\nBefore dealing with the relations and feelings of parties to and towards each other, it may be stated it was proven conclusively by the hospital records and by medical testimony, and not denied by anybody, that prior to November, 1929, the complainant had suffered very severely from varicose ulcers and veins and eczema of lower legs, for which he was treated in the Prince Island hospital for nearly a month; that, though he was discharged from the hospital with the ulcers temporarily healed, he was readmitted in August, 1930, when he was found by the hospital physicians in consultation to be suffering from a condition of acute mental depression, diagnosed as melancholia, and that, though he was discharged and returned to his home on September 6th\u2014four days before Clow married his daughter\u2014his condition was entered as unimproved. Mrs. McKay admitted that she knew before he went into the hospital the second time that he was not all right in his head, and that he was sick in his mind in 1930, so much so that on one occasion, when she spoke of his carrying a rope about with him, she thought he might do away with himself, and that she kept watching him. She did, however, say that he looked better on his return from the hospital, and that from that time on he was in good health except that his legs at times were in bad shape. Clow in his evidence took the same position, though in the course of his cross examination as to an assault that he made upon the complainant in 1934, he admitted he was a crippled old man at the time.\nMrs. McKay's aggressive and dominating influence over her husband and daughter, as well as her lack of affection and respect for the complainant, is apparent throughout her own entire testimony. Notwithstanding that for more than 20 years she had been investing and reinvesting moneys, which her husband had given her out of the profits of his farm and of the store, which years before he had established in connection with the farmhouse, but of which she had taken full charge, and had thus established quite a substantial independent estate of her own, out of which she was able herself to give her daughter, Hazel, an automobile as a wedding present, and that the latter had also invested and reinvested moneys derived from her father's property in a number of other mortgages, she described her husband not only as inconsiderate and stingy, throughout their whole married life, but as one who \"would put his child on the road,\" and whose presence would \"pretty near put a fear in you any time,\"\u2014\" a terrible boss,\" who \" made his own feel it,\" and of whom \" we were in a dread all the time.\"\nAt the risk of prolonging what is, perhaps, already too lengthy a judgment, I quote the following extract from her cross-examination, as it appears on p. 218 of the appeal book, regarding Clow's coming to live on the place:\u2014\nQ. No arrangement was made, you say? A. No.\nQ. You told Mr. Bell no arrangement made at the time, Hazel didn't want to leave so you invited him to stay, didn't you? A. I asked him to stay, yes.\nQ. You asked him to stay; were you running the business at that time? A. Well, when I was doing the most of the work I wanted some help.\nQ. You wanted some help? A. Hazel and I had the most to do, we wanted some help.\nQ. It was you asked him to stay? A. Yes, I asked him to stay.\nQ. You didn't want your daughter to live\u2014you didn't want her to go down and live at this other place with his people? A. \/ didn't want us to be separated and we will not be only by death.\nQ. So it was you insisted upon him staying there? A. Yes.\nQ. All right. Now, your husband didn't want him to stay there you told us? A. He wanted his work.\nQ. Did he want him there? A. He wanted his work.\nQ. Did he want him living there? A. Well, I don't know that he objected only at times when they would disagree. Q. At times when they would disagree he told him he didn't want him, is that right? A. Well, I never heard the disagreement very much.\nQ. Well, did you hear that your husband had told him, did you hear. from him or from your daughter or from anybody that at times your husband didn't want him there? A. I don't know.\nQ. You knew he was not wanted there? A. I knew he was not wanted there\u2014\nQ. By your husband, he was wanted by you? A. Yes.\nQ. But he was not wanted by your husband? A. I suppose not.\nQ. And of course then there was trouble, wasn't there? A. Sure.\nQ. Sure there was trouble, oh, you bet! A. But there was trouble long before he came there.\nQ. There was trouble? A. Yes.\nQ. But the trouble got intensified because he didn't want him there and you did? A. Our lives were not safe there without a man.\nQ. Your lives were not safe there without a man? A. No, they were not.\nHaving thus completely subordinated his own wishes to his wife's in a matter upon which she was so firmly set, one would have thought that this would have softened her feeling towards her aging and enfeebled husband, but unfortunately such was not the case. Her own evidence, far from exhibiting any disposition on her part to avoid further disagreement with him regarding the conduct of the farm, and to make things as comfortable as possible for him in the circumstances in the home, of which he was still supposed to be the head, indicates only constantly increasing animosity towards him. Of course she blamed this entirely upon his irritable and disagreeable nature. \"You could live,\" she said, \"but he would not agree to anything we wanted to do.\" She gave no particulars as to what these things were, which they wanted to do, but did mention two instances, where Clow and her daughter did things in open defiance of her husband's wishes and positive instructions. These were the sinking of the water pump in a location chosen by Clow and Mrs. McKay, and the use of a particular mare for the spreading of fertilizer. Both these instances appear to have occurred in the year 1934.\nWithout going into the unpleasant details of the last mentioned, as related by Mr. and Mrs. Clow, suffice it to say that it culminated in Clow assaulting the complainant in the stable doorway, clinching him and throwing him down on the stable floor on his back. His excuse was that the old man (who was then admittedly lame and unable to fight) was standing in the stable doorway shaking his fists at him, after he (Clow) had taken out in Hazel's presence the mare he had just forbidden the latter to use for that purpose, and that he did not intend to hurt him, but only \" to give him a fright,\" that he \" thought a fright would do him good.\"\nAnd here I should point out\u2014and I do so with much regret\u2014that the daughter's own evidence discloses that she herself on another occasion, before the execution of the documents, also assaulted her father and knocked him down. Her explanation is that he tried to stop her from taking another horse out of the stable, and that she pushed him and he fell down. Whether he tripped and fell on his face she said she could not remember. \"Do you think,\" she was asked, \"it was right to do that to your own father?\" to which she answered, \" Well, I Was looking after the horse, so I think I had as much to do with the horse as he had.\" She said she reported that incident to her mother but could not remember what the latter said. Later she said she was taking the horse out to put it in a sleigh, but could not remember whether her husband was going with her or not.\nAll three respondents admitted that the relations between themselves on the one side and the complainant on the other were all the time getting worse and worse. It is not surprising, therefore, to read in Mrs. McKay's examination-in-chief that when four hired men came to the place to assist in haying operations in the season of 1935, that she refused to get dinner for any of them, as had been her custom in the past, and that they had either to return to their own homes for dinner or be fed at neighbouring houses; and that when the complainant brought one of these men to the house and particularly ordered her to get dinner for him that the complainant became irritated at her refusal.\nThis, of course, precipitated another altercation and Mrs. McKay declares that after they had their own dinner he caught her by the back of the neck and shoved her in the corner. \"So I thought then, \"she declared, \"it was time to do something and I went to a magistrate and had him bound over to the peace.\" This she said she did after haymaking. McKay in his evidence admitted that he had given his wife a shake on the occasion mentioned, and swore that he heard her call Clow to come to her assistance and that he heard Clow say she had \" a chance now to pull him and why not do it.\" It is not denied that he was summoned before a magistrate at Montague, charged with assaulting his wife, or that the three respondents appeared in the magistrate's court against him, of that he was fined $5 and costs, or $15 or $16 in all, including their witness fees, and bound over to keep the peace for one year.\nNotwithstanding the humiliation to which he had thus been subjected by his wife and daughter and son-in-law, and the advantage which they had thereby gained over him, the appellant was still the exclusive owner of the 177-acre farm and all the live stock, farming implements and other personal property upon it, and, unless he was prepared to abandon it entirely to the respondents, had no other recourse than to make his home in the farm house along with them during the approaching winter at least. One has only to read his wife's testimony together with his as to their attitude towards each other during that fall and winter, to see which of them was now the dominating spirit in the management, not only of the household, but of the entire farm. The ownership of the property had yet to be transferred. That was accomplished by the execution of the deed and agreement of February 26th.\nSeventeen or eighteen days before the execution of these documents, on February 8th or 9th, around the noon hour, there was a fire in the dining room, which seems to have originated from a defective flue. According to Clow, there were three or four places where the fire came out between the bricks, and the plaster had to be removed from the wall and some of the floor boards taken up to extinguish the blaze. He himself was away, as he usually was during the day, at the time, but on his return he learned what had happened, and says that he stayed home that night and watched the flue, and that it was in such condition that he did not feel like sleeping in the house, and that he and Hazel didn't sleep \" or at least there was always one of us awake that night in case the house should catch and we would be burned in it.\" He couldn't afford, he said, to lose his clothes should the house catch fire again, so the next morning he got all his clothes he didn't need in his trunk\u2014\" all my best clothes \"\u2014as he later put it, and Hazel and he brought the trunk downstairs and put it outside. Mr. McKay was in the kitchen when they came down, and Clow's story is that when he and Hazel came back in, McKay wanted to know why he was taking this out. His answer was, \"the house is not safe.\" Without any discussion whatever as to the safety of the house, according to Clow, McKay wanted to know then, \"What did I want and stay,\" to which Clow answered he \"would not ask him for anything.\"\nQ. You told him you would not ask him for anything? A. The next thing he said to me, \"You want it all.\"\nQ. \"You want all.\" Yes. A. Well, my answer to that was there was a long ways between it all and nothing. That was my answer.\nQ. A long ways between it all\u2014\u2014? A. And nothing, which I had been\ngetting up till that time; so he still wanted to know what I would take, I said \" I would not ask you for anything and I am not going to ask you for anything but if you will make me an offer, I will tell you whether I will accept it or not.\n* * *\nQ. What was his offer? A. Mr. McKay's offer was that he would give us one-half of everything on the place and at his death and Mrs. McKay's death we were to have the place, everything in connection with the farm, and the farm.\nQ, Whose offer was that? A. Mr. McKay's. Now, I had not asked him for one thing.\nQ. You had not asked him for one thing? A. And I told him that we would accept that offer.\nQ. Right there that day? A. Yes, and we talked it over. And Mr. McKay thought that I would go right to work that day and I told him no, that we had to have this on paper, this offer, all fixed up in a legal way.\nQ. Yes. Had to have this on paper, all fixed up in a legal way? A. He wanted to put it off till the next spring.\nQ. Till the spring? A. I told him that would suit me. He wanted to have the thing postponed then till the next spring and I told him that would suit me but I would not do one day's work until the papers were signed.\nQ. The papers were signed? A. So he spoke about,\u2014I would not work until this agreement and all those things were signed. Well, he said it was too cold for him to go away for a lawyer and in the state his legs was in he could not get around very good. So Mrs. McKay, she suggested Will McLure.\nQ. So Mrs. McKay\u2014she suggested Will McLure\u2014who was Will McLure? A. Our Magistrate in Murray Harbour North.\nQ. Your Magistrate in Murray Harbour North? A. Now, we talked this over in the house there, I just can't give the exact words of what went on but after she suggested Will McLure, now I asked Mr. McKay\u2014\u2014\nQ. You asked Mr. McKay? A. Would he have William McLure.\nQ. Would he have William McLure\u2014? A. Come to the house. And he said he would. And I asked him would I go in that day when I was going to my mother's and ask Mr. McLure to come down, that he wanted him. And he said yes, to tell Will McLure to come down. From Mrs. McKay's evidence we learn, not only that she had told her husband the night before that Clow and Hazel were going to leave, but that she herself had made up her mind to leave with them, and that in the conversation that took place between Clow and her husband and herself in the kitchen when Clow brought his trunk down next morning, she made that clear to her husband. Also that, when Clow accepted Will's offer and he told him to go to work, she (Mrs. McKay) herself said \"Not till that goes on paper.\"\nNotwithstanding that Clow must have understood that the enfeebled old man wanted to postpone the putting of the alleged verbal agreement in proper legal form until the spring (when he could go and consult his lawyer), till Mrs. McKay \"suggested Will McLure\" (as Clow put it), or \" that William McLure could do that as good as anyone,\" (as Mrs. McKay herself stated it), Clow obligingly stopped at McLure's on his way to his mother's home that very morning, and told McLure \"that Will McKay wanted him.\" McLure went down to McKay's that day, as Clow says he found out when he returned from his mother's that night. \"They told me,\" he said,\" what they had told Mr. McLure to do.\" By \"they\" he explained he meant Mr. and Mrs. McKay and Hazel. Asked if they said what had gone on, he replied: \" Well, they told me that they had told Mr. McLure the offer that Mr. McKay had made and that he was to draw up\u2014to write this out to the best of his ability on a paper and to come back in a few days.\" Mr. McKay, he had explained, did not do \"all the talking\"\u2014the three were there\u2014\"and Mr. McKay done some of the talking.\" In the meantime all fear that they might be burned up if they remained in the house any longer seems to have completely vanished from both Mr. and Mrs. Clow's minds. They all waited for McLure to come back with his \"writing.\" He did come back in a few days. On this, his second visit, Clow was there, as well as Hazel and Mr. and Mrs. McKay, and, according to Clow, \"Mr. McLure had a paper drawn up with things in it that they wanted in the business we were getting done,\"\u2014or, as he later described it, \"about three sheets of paper wrote out\"\u2014and it was Mr. McLure and Mr. McKay \" that done all the talking.\" He (Clow) had nothing to say, \"any more than when they would say anything he would agree with it.\" He did say that when Mr. and Mrs. McKay were describing the boundaries of the farm and talking it over, they both wanted something in the agreement, when it was drawn up, which would prevent any of his (Clow's) people, if anything should happen to him, from claiming during the life of Hazel anything that he would have there. If such an instruction were given it is quite evident that McLure paid no attention to it, for neither the deed nor the agreement contains any safeguard whatever against either the land or the personal property going outside the McKay family. As a matter of fact, McLure expressly denied that Mr. McKay told him it was not to go outside the McKay family. Moreover, McLure's statement to the defendant's counsel in his examination-in-chief regarding his instructions in connection with the proposed transfer was that Mr. and Mrs. McKay were going to give the half of the place to the son-in-law and daughter and the remainder at their death, and that they were to live together and work together on the halves. Having said this, he added, he went home and drew out the memorandum to the best of his ability. But before that he had told the parties that he would not have anything to do with the preparation of the necessary papers, that he was going to take what he had written as a memorandum to some lawyer to have it legally done, as he didn't consider himself capable. However, he did prepare a written memorandum, took it back to the McKay house and said he read it over and that they were all agreed.\nAccording to Clow, Mr. McKay wanted to know how Mr. McLure was going to get to a lawyer, and Mr. McLure said he could have him (Clow) take him to Murray River and the two agreed on a time to go either one or two days after the memorandum had been read and agreed to. Clow called for McLure and took him to Murray River and thence by train to Charlottetown. On their arrival at Charlottetown Clow says McLure wanted to go to Mr. Lowther but as the latter was not in his office they went along the street and saw Bell & Mathieson's sign so they went in there. Clow says Mr. McLure had the memorandum of instructions with him, but he does not say whether or not he gave it to Mr. Bell, with whom he says McLure did the talking. Clow admitted that he paid McLure's expenses as well as Bell & Mathieson's bill out of his own pocket. The two returned to Murray Harbour North that night and Clow says he never saw McLure again until the latter came to McKay's to have the documents executed, when he and Hazel and Mr. and Mrs. McKay were all present. According to Clow, McLure read over the documents and explained anything that Mr. McKay asked him, to the best of his ability, and he says that after this Mr. McKay asked his wife if she was satisfied and would sign it, and that she said she would sign it after he did. At any rate, the documents were signed by all four. McLure took the deed away and gave Clow one duplicate of the agreement and left the other on the table for Mr. and Mrs. McKay. The deed was registered within a few days.\nA most unfortunate circumstance regarding the written instructions, upon which the documents were supposed to be based, and one which would seem to throw added suspicion upon the whole transaction, is the complete failure of the record to explain the disappearance of the memorandum of instructions. McLure says he never saw it after he left Bell & Mathieson's office. Mr. Bell says that he remembered a sheet of paper with some memorandum on it concerning an agreement of settlement between Mr. and Mrs. McKay and Mr. and Mrs. Clow, and that he had no record of having that memorandum or whether it was left with him that day or not, and that since the commencement of the suit he had made a careful search through all the files and records at their office but had not been able to find it anywhere. As Mr. Justice Arsenault says in his reasons, there is no reflection whatever to be cast on Mr. Bell, who prepared the documents, but we are not told what was in the memorandum or what instructions were given by either McLure or Clow, or whether the documents correspond or were in conformity with what was contained in the memorandum, and Mr. McLure, who prepared it, could not recall what was in it.\nThe appellant's counsel in the course of his argument before us stated, and it was not denied, that Mr. McLure was one of the magistrates, who had in the previous autumn or fall convicted the appellant of the assault on his wife, and bound him over to keep the peace. Then, having procured the execution of the deed and agreement in the manner and under the conditions and circumstances described by Mr. McLure, Clow and Mrs. McKay, the two last mentioned immediately proceeded to take complete charge of the farm, as their own evidence plainly shows, without accounting in any way to the complainant for any of the receipts or expenditures. They both said no profit had been made out of the so called joint operation of the farm in the nearly three years that had elapsed, to the time of the trial, on account of their having turned all their receipts into the improvement of the place through replacement of farm machinery, acquiring more live stock, repairing the barns, painting the house, etc., which they admitted doing themselves without consulting Mr. McKay. He was away, she said, most of the time with his stallion, earning $30 a day. She was asked, however, if he went home from court and this case stopped, would she permit him to take charge of everything? She answered that none of them could live with him.\nWhen one recalls the representations of the executed agreement about the natural love and affection of the parties for each other and the undertaking of all four \" to work to the best of their ability for the successful operation of the farm and the mutual benefit of all concerned,\" and considers the confusing character of the two impugned documents when read together, all this evidence of Mrs. McKay and Clow seems to me itself to demonstrate, not only the onesidedness and improvidence, but the falsity and sinister underlying purpose of the whole transaction.\nNotwithstanding this testimony of the defendants themselves, the learned trial judge found that no evidence had been submitted to establish that any undue influence was used by the defendants or any of them to procure the execution of the two documents. Apparently he did so upon the assumption that the relationship of the parties and the circumstances leading up to the execution of the documents were not such as to create any doubt or suspicion as to their genuineness, and that the burden consequently rested upon the plaintiff to affirmatively prove that some undue influence was in fact exercised. He attached no importance to the fact that the defendants had the complainant bound over to keep the peace, to the latter's expressed desire to consult his own lawyer before signing any formal agreement, to the threat of all three to leave him in his helpless condition, if the agreement should not be put in legal form and signed, to the fact that Clow accompanied McLure to the solicitor's office when the instructions for the preparation of the required papers were given, and himself paid all the expenses in that connection, to the mysterious disappearance of the written memorandum of instructions, which McLure carried with him to the lawyer's office, or to the fact that neither the deed of conveyance nor the collateral agreement under seal contained any power of revocation. \"The complainant,\" His Lordship said,\ntrusted his friend [McLure] and was satisfied he would have things completed as he had instructed without any independent advisor. Why then the necessity of independent legal advice? Surely any sensible man has a right to have a well considered business transaction such as the one under consideration completed without the necessity of engaging the services of any independent legal advisor.\nThe question, however, was not, whether the complainant had trusted a friend, but whether his execution of the deed and collateral agreement was the result of the domination of the mind of someone else, rather than the free, independent and unfettered expression of his own. Or, as Lord Chancellor Eldon expressed it in Huguenin v. Baseley ([1]):\nThe question is, not, whether she knew what she was doing, had done, or proposed to do, but how the intention was produced: whether all that care and providence was placed round her, as against those, who advised her, which, from their situation and relation with respect to her, they were bound to exert on her behalf.\nAs regards that vital question, the established rule of equity is that, whenever it appears that any party to a transaction, from which he or she derives some large or immoderate benefit, occupies such a position in relation to his or her supposed benefactor as to give the recipient a dominating influence over the latter, that benefit is presumed to have been obtained by the exercise of some undue influence on the part of the recipient. In all such cases, whatever be the nature of the transaction, whether a gift inter vivos or a contract alleged to have been made for a good and sufficient consideration, the onus of proof lies on the party who seeks to support it The passages quoted in the appellant's factum from pages 103, 110 and 119 of vol. 29, Am. & Eng. Enc. of Law [2nd ed.], very accurately, I think, sum up the law as now recognized by the courts of law and equity alike in this country and of England upon this point.\nAnglin J., as he then was, reviewed the leading authorities on this important question in 1908 in his trial judgment in Smith v. Alexander ([2]), and clearly pointed out that it is not merely where such well defined confidential relations as those of trustee and cestui que trust, guardian. and ward, solicitor and client, or physician and patient exist between the beneficiary and the grantor that courts of equity cast upon the beneficiary the burden, not only of establishing clearly that the grantor fully understood and intended the transaction, but that he voluntarily and deliberately performed the act, knowing its nature and effect. He held that the contents and effect of the deed there in question themselves threw upon the defendants the burden of proving its validity, \" that is to say, that it emanated from the pure, uninfluenced will of the plaintiff, after having the extent and effect of it fully explained to her,\" and that that burden the defendants had not discharged.\nIn Beeman v. Knapp ([3]), Mowat V.C. refused to uphold the validity of a deed made by an old man to his son, who had managed his father's farm for years, in consideration of a bond to maintain the grantor and his wife, because it was not shown to have been made freely and voluntarily after competent independent advice. \"Considering the relation of the parties,\" he said ([4]),\nthe transaction in question could only be sustained on evidence of the fullest information to the grantor as to these possible consequences of what he was doing; and evidence of his having had competent independent advice,\n(citing Sharp v. Leach ([5])). He pointed out that the son had alarmed his father in his old age by the threat of a law suit, and also that the son \"had on his side the active and zealous influence of his mother.\" He further said:\nPrima facie, a conveyance of all a man's property in his old age, without any power of revocation, in consideration of a mere promise of maintenance, whether under seal or not, is extremely improvident. In Hopkins v. Hopkins ([6]), the Divisional Court of Ontario, presided over by Chancellor Boyd, overruled a trial judgment and set aside a transfer of 300 shares of bank stock, which had been obtained from an elderly husband, who had suffered from heart disease and other infirmities and some weakening of mental faculties, by a younger wife, on the ground that upon the authorities there appeared to be \" quite insufficient care taken to see that the donor understood what he was doing, and to guard him from acting improvidently and from surrendering weakly to the clamour of his wife.\" And this notwithstanding that a Mr. C, a Registrar of Deeds, who had been a solicitor, and had sometimes acted as such for the husband, testified that the latter made up his mind to assign the shares to his wife for the reason he had willed it to her, and it would be for only two or three months before he died and she might as well take the deed of it now. \" The intervention of Mr. C,\" said the Chancellor, \" gave no assistance to the alleged donor; he did no more than give the matter legal form, and was not there as the adviser of the person who needed advice.\"\nSee also the judgment of Chancellor Spragge in Lavin v. Lavin ([7]), in which he carefully reviewed the leading authorities.\nFor my part, I can conceive of no case where independent and indeed highly competent legal advice would be more necessary than in the consideration and carrying out of such an involved and perplexing transaction as that which is the subject of this appeal.\nThe learned trial judge himself found that the deed, as executed, omitted a most important provision which, on the strength of Clow's own evidence, he found that McKay desired, viz.: that the deed and agreement should contain a proviso that the property was not to go outside the McKay family, though McLure denied there was any such instruction. What Clow had really sworn to was that it was only in the event of anything happening to him that both Mr. and Mrs. McKay wanted to be protected against any claim from the Clow family during the life of Hazel against anything that he would have there, or, as he attempted to put it in other words to his own counsel, that, should he die before Hazel, the Clows were not to step in. Accepting, therefore, the statement of Clow, and rejecting the denial of McLure, His Lordship said his impression was that the insertion of a joint tenancy to Mr. and Mrs. Clow after the death of both Mr. and Mrs. McKay was an inadvertent mistake on the part of the lawyer, who had no definite knowledge of the wish and desire of the complainant and his wife in regard to this particular point. For this reason the trial court decreed that the words \" as joint tenants and not\" in the habendum of the deed should be expunged, so as to make them both tenants in common. Just how the proposed amendment would make the deed conform to the wishes and instructions of the grantor and his wife in so essential a particular I confess I am unable to understand. While a joint tenancy would, of course, mean that Clow's death before Hazel's would end his interest in the property, it would give him the whole absolutely in the event of Hazel's predeceasing him. On the other hand, a tenancy in common would vest in each a distinct, though undivided, half share, which would go to Clow absolutely, whether his wife predeceased him or not.\nI would allow the appeal and direct that both the deed and the agreement be delivered up to be cancelled and that the appellant have his costs in the appeal to this Court.\nThe judgment of Davis and Hudson JJ. (dissenting) was delivered by\nDAVIS J.\u2014The action out of which this appeal came to this Court was commenced by the appellant by bill of complaint, dated July 8th, 1938, in the Court of Chancery of Prince Edward Island, against his wife and his daughter and his son-in-law, praying that a deed of conveyance dated February 26th, 1936, of his farm in Prince Edward Island and an agreement of the same date between the parties, be set aside, rescinded and cancelled.\nBy the said deed of conveyance the appellant conveyed his farm (his wife joining to bar her right to dower) to his married daughter and her husband, who were living with him on the farm, but reserving a life estate, without impeachment for waste, in favour of himself and his wife and the survivor of them. By a collateral agreement of the same date, which his counsel agreed must be read with the deed of conveyance, the appellant and his wife and his daughter and his son-in-law agreed \" to carrying on farming operations jointly on the said farm with equal rights and liabilities\" as to profits and expenditures, and \"all the parties hereto are to take part in the working and operation of the farm and to give all their time thereto and to work to the best of their ability for the successful operation of the farm and the mutual benefit of all concerned.\" The daughter and her husband, it was agreed, were to have a home in the dwelling on the farm \"and all the parties are to live together as heretofore.\" The daughter and her husband agreed \"to care for\" the mother and father during their lives and the life of the survivor, \"their support and maintenance to be from their share of profits of the farming operations and to be in a manner in keeping with the earnings of the farm.\"\nThe appellant, who was about seventy years of age at the time of the transaction, by his bill of complaint alleged that both documents, the deed of conveyance and the agreement between the parties,\nwere executed by him in advanced age, at a time when he was infirm and of weak understanding, and unable to resist the threats and importunities of the defendants, or some or one of them; they were executed without independent legal or other disinterested advice, at a time when the complainant was under the influence of the defendants; the same were executed improvidently, and without any power of revocation; the consideration was grossly inadequate; the documents were prepared by solicitors selected and paid by the defendants, who gave the instructions for same without any consent on the part of the complainant, and the contents of which did not express the wishes or desires of the complainant.\nThe action went to trial before Saunders J., Master of the Rolls, and a great deal of evidence was taken. The husband (appellant) and his wife and their daughter and son-in-law were all present and gave evidence. The learned trial judge, in such a conflict of testimony as there was in the unfortunate family dispute, had the advantage, so important in a case of this sort, of seeing and hearing all the parties to the impeached transaction. The case was one of fact essentially for the trial judge to determine and he found on the facts in most definite language that the transaction was a fair and reasonable one. The trial judge said that the complainant gave his evidence in as rational a manner as a man could possibly do, and that he regarded him as a man of more than ordinary intelligence and quite capable of transacting his business affairs, without any one being able to take advantage of him. Further, the trial judge said the complainant realized he was no longer able to do very much farm work and wished to make some proper provision for his wife and himself in their advancing years and took this method of consummating his wishes and desires; it was the spontaneous act of the complainant with a free and independent exercise of his will. \"The evidence indicates conclusively,\" said the trial judge,\nthat no advantage was taken of the complainant and that everything was dome and completed as the complainant had requested. There was no duress or fraud practised on the complainant by any one. He knew full well what he wanted to do and what he did was his own offer, his own voluntary and deliberate act and no undue influence whatever was used.\nThe learned trial judge held that the deed of conveyance (with an amendment striking out the words \"as joint tenants\" and leaving the words \"as tenants in common\") and the agreement between the parties were valid and subsisting. No costs were allowed to any of the parties to the suit.\nThe appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal in Equity of Prince Edward Island. Only two judges sat in that Court on this appeal and they were divided in their opinions. Chief Justice Mathieson agreed with the reasons of the Master of the Rolls and would dismiss the appeal with-out costs. Arsenault J., Vice-Chancellor, in his judgment examined the evidence in great detail and concluded that the transaction was \"so fraught with the elements of compulsion, if not with fraud and deceit,\" that the deed \"executed under such suspicious circumstances\" ought not to be allowed to stand. He would therefore have declared the deed void and have ordered it to be delivered up to be cancelled, but would have given no costs. The formal judgment of the Court of Appeal merely dismissed the appeal and confirmed the judgment of the Master of the Rolls (Saunders J.) without costs. From that judgment the appellant then appealed to this Court.\nIt is unnecessary to decide whether the deed of conveyance, in view of the collateral agreement, can strictly be said to be a voluntary conveyance to which the rule that the onus rests on the grantees to justify the transaction applies, because in both courts below the deed has been treated as a voluntary conveyance and the appellant has had whatever advantage there was in that interpretation of the deed.\nThis sort of case, in our opinion, is essentially one of fact for the trial judge who sees and hears the several members of the family who unfortunately find themselves in a bitter family controversy. It is very difficult, if not impossible, on a paper record of the evidence to form any conclusion as to the rights and wrongs of the various contentions advanced by the parties. To reverse the findings of a trial judge in such a case we should have to be convinced that he was wrong. Notwithstanding the very forcible argument of appellant's counsel, we are far from being convinced that there is any sound ground upon which this Court should interfere.\nIn our opinion, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J.

The Tobacco Tax Act, 1940 (N.B.), c. 44, provides, inter alia, that \"every consumer of tobacco purchased at a retail sale in the province shall pay to\" the province \"for the raising of a revenue, at the time of making his purchase, a tax in respect of the consumption of such tobacco\" (section 4); and the Act also provides that \"every person residing or ordinarily resident or carrying on business in\" the province \"who brings into the province or who receives delivery in the province of tobacco for his own consumption or for the consumption of other persons at his expense or on behalf of or as agent for a principal who desires to acquire such tobacco for consumption by such principal or other persons at his expense * * * shall pay the same tax in respect of the consumption of such tobacco\" (section 5). Section 10 provides that \"a consumer shall be and remain liable for the tax imposed by the Act until the same has been collected.\" Under section 2 (a) \"consumer\" means not only any person who within the Province purchases tobacco for his own consumption, but also any other person who purchases tobacco in the Province as agent for his principal who desires to acquire such tobacco for consumption by such principal. It was also enacted (section 3 (2)) that only retail vendors licensed under the Act may sell tobacco at a retail sale in the province. Regulations made under the Act by Orders in Council were declared to have the force of statute (section 20 (2)). Regulation 6 provides that \"every application for a (retail) vendor's license * * * shall contain an undertaking by the applicant to collect and remit the tax * * * and shall be in Form 2\"; and when signing that Form, the applicant undertakes \"to act as the agent of the Minister for the collection of the tax * * * and to account to the province * * * for all moneys so collected.\"\nHeld, by a majority of the Court, that the Act is within the constitutional powers of the province, except as to the provisions making the agent, who buys tobacco for his principal personally liable for the tax, which provisions are severable.\nThe Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Davis were of the opinion that the entire Act was ultra vires the province.\nMr Justice Rinfret and Mr. Justice Crocket were of the opinion that the entire Act was intra vires the province.\nMr. Justice Kerwin was of the opinion that section 5 and also the provisions making the agent personally liable for the tax were ultra vires the province.\nMr. Justice Hudson and Mr. Justice Taschereau were of the opinion that the Act was intra vires the province, except as to the personal liability of the agent for the tax.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, appeal division[1], which held that the Tobacco Tax Act, (N.B.) was intra vires the province.\nThe question in issue in this case is the constitutionality of \"An Act to provide for imposing a tax on the consumption of tobacco\" (1940, (N.B.) 4 Geo. VI, c. 44), hereinafter referred to as The Tobacco Tax Act. The appellant caused a writ to issue in the Chancery-Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick claiming an injunction restraining the respondents Conlon and McDonough, and each of them, from entering upon the store premises of the appellant, in the city of Saint John, or from accosting, questioning, or otherwise interfering with customers of the appellant while on those premises, or on the streets adjacent thereto, with reference to any purchase of tobacco, or the payment of any tobacco tax under the authority of the Act above mentioned, or the regulations under it.\nThe parties agreed upon the following statement of facts:\nThat the plaintiff, Atlantic Smoke Shops Limited, is a corporation duly incorporated by letters patent issued under the Companies Act of the Dominion of Canada and having its head office at the city of Saint John in the province of New Brunswick.\nThat on the eleventh day of May, A.D. 1940, the legislature of the province of New Brunswick purported to enact a statute, being chapter 44, 4 George VI, cited as The Tobacco Tax Act. The said Act came into force on the 1st day of October, A.D. 1940, by proclamation of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council.\nThat under the authority of the said Act the Lieutenant-Governor in Council purported to make regulations styled \"Regulations Under Tobacco Tax Act\"\nThat on the fifteenth day of October, A.D. 1940, the said Atlantic Smoke Shops Limited opened a store on the northeast corner of Waterloo and Peters streets in the said city of Saint John, and thereafter carried on and now carries on therein the business of selling tobacco, including cigars and cigarettes.\nThat the said plaintiff carried on and now carries on its said business without having obtained any license so to do under the Tobacco Tax Act or the said regulations.\nThat in its said store the said plaintiff has since the fifteenth day of October, A.D. 1940, sold and is now selling at retail sale tobacco, including cigars and cigarettes, manufactured in provinces of Canada other than the province of New Brunswick, to persons defined by section 2 (a) of the said Tobacco Tax Act as \"Consumers\" or \"Consumers of Tobacco,\" without collecting the tax imposed by the said Act.\nThat the defendant, James H. Conlon, was on the coming into force of said Tobacco Tax Act appointed to the office of Tobacco Tax Commissioner, being the office, created under the regulations hereinbefore referred to and has since occupied and now occupies said office.\nThat on the second day of November, A.D. 1940, and from time to time thereafter, the defendant John McDonough, an inspector appointed under the said Act, and others, all acting under the instructions of the other defendants, entered upon the plaintiff's said premises and proceeded to question customers of the plaintiff as to whether they had paid the provincial tax on the tobacco purchased by them from the plaintiff, to ask them to produce their tobacco tax receipts and to demand their names and addresses. The said defendant John McDonough and other persons so entering the said premises as aforesaid refused to leave the same when requested so to do by the plaintiff, and claimed that they were entitled to remain therein and to question the said customers of the plaintiff by virtue of certain provisions of the said Tobacco Tax Act and the regulations made thereunder.\nThat by reason of the said actions of the defendants the said business of the plaintiff has been and is now being injuriously affected.\nThe question for the opinion of the Court was expressed in these terms:\nThe question for the opinion of the Court is whether the Tobacco Tax Act, or any of the provisions thereof, and\/or the regulations made thereunder or any of them, and in what particular or particulars or to what extent are ultra vires of the legislature of the province of New Brunswick.\nIf the Court shall be of opinion that the said Act and Regulations are wholly intra vires this action shall be dismissed.\nIf the Court shall be of opinion that the said Act and Regulations are wholly ultra vires, judgment shall be entered in favour of the plaintiff and against the defendants for an injunction order in the terms of the claim endorsed on the writ of summons herein.\nIf the Court shall be of the opinion that the said Act and Regulations, or any of them are intra vires in part and ultra vires in part, the Court shall make such order, by way of declaration and\/or by way of substantive relief to the plaintiff, as it shall deem right and proper.\nThe stated case was submitted to the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, appeal division, which held unanimously[2] that the Act was within the constitutional powers of the province.\nFrom that judgment, the Atlantic Smoke Shops Limited appealed to this Court by special leave granted by the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick.\nThe legislature of the province of Quebec has adopted in 1940 a statute, 4 Geo. VI, c. 15, entitled the Tobacco Tax Act, which is somewhat similar in its provisions to the New Brunswick statute. The Quebec Act has been held intra vires the province by the Superior Court, Trahan J.[3], which judgment was affirmed by the Court of King's Bench, appeal side[4]. In view of that fact, the Attorney-General for the province of Quebec was allowed to intervene, on this appeal by order of this Court, in order to support the constitutionality of the New Brunswick Act.\nThe material provisions of the Tobacco Tax Act of New Brunswick are the following:\n2. (a) \"Consumer\" or \"Consumer of Tobacco\" means any person who within the Province, purchases from a vendor tobacco at a retail sale in the Province for his own consumption or for the consumption of other persons at his expense or who, within the Province, purchases from a vendor tobacco at a retail sale in the Province on behalf of or as agent for a principal who desires to acquire such tobacco for consumption by such principal or other persons at the expense of such principal.\n***\n(d) \"Purchaser\" means any person who, within the Province, purchases from a retail vendor tobacco at a retail sale in the Province.\n(e) \"Retail Sale\" means a sale to a consumer for purposes of consumption and not for resale.\n(f) \"Retail Vendor\" means any person who, within the Province, sells tobacco to a consumer.\n***\n3. (2) No persons shall sell any tobacco in the Province at a retail sale unless he holds a retail vendor's license issued to him under authority of this Act and such license is in force at the time of sale.\n(3) No wholesale vendor shall sell any tobacco in the Province for resale in the Province to a person who is not a vendor duly licensed\nunder this Act.\n***\n4. Every consumer of tobacco purchased at a retail sale in the Province shall pay to His Majesty the King in the right of the Province for the raising of a revenue, at the time of making his purchase, a tax in respect of the consumption of such, tobacco, and such tax shall be computed at the rate of ten per centum of the retail price of the tobacco purchased.\n5. Every person residing or ordinarily resident or carrying on business in New Brunswick, who brings into the Province or who receives delivery in the Province of tobacco for his own consumption or for the consumption of other persons at his expense or on behalf of or as agent for a principal who desires to acquire such tobacco for consumption by such principal or other persons at his expense shall immediately report the matter to the Minister and forward or produce to him the invoice, if any, in respect of such tobacco and any other information required by the Minister with respect to the tobacco and shall pay the same tax in respect of the consumption of such tobacco as would have been payable if the tobacco had been purchased at a retail sale in the Province at the same price.\n***\n7. No retail vendor shall advertise or hold out or state to the public or to any consumer, directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof imposed by this Act will be assumed or absorbed by the retail vendor or that it will not be considered as an element in the price to the consumer or, if added, that it or any part thereof will be refunded.\n8. The tax shall be collected, accounted for and paid to the Minister by such persons, at such times and in such manner as the regulations may prescribe.\n***\n10. A consumer shall be and remain liable for the tax imposed by this Act until the same has been collected.\n*** 20. (1) For the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of this Act according to their true intent or of supplying any deficiency therein the Lieutenant-Governor in Council may make such regulations, not inconsistent with the spirit of this Act, as are considered necessary or advisable, and without limiting the generality of the aforegoing the Lieutenant-Governor in Council may make regulations:\n***\n(2) Such regulations may from time to time be repealed, amended or varied and, if repealed, may be re-enacted, and such regulations shall have the same force and effect as if enacted by this Act and shall be published in the Royal Gazette.\nThe material Regulations made under the Act are the following:\n6. Every application for a vendor's license, other than a wholesale vendor's license, shall contain an undertaking by the applicant to collect and remit the tax in accordance with the provisions of the Act and these Regulations and shall be in Form 2 of the Schedule to these Regulations, as near as may be. The applicant shall state in his application for a license an estimated amount of his normal monthly Tobacco Sales.\nForm 2 contains the following:\nI\/We, upon acceptance of License to Retail Tobacco, agree and undertake to act as the Agent of the Minister for the collection of the Tax imposed by said Act and to account to the Province of New Brunswick for all moneys so collected as provided by the Act and regulations.\nThe other material Regulations are:\n9. No person, other than the holder of an itinerant salesman's license issued under the provisions of Regulation 11, shall, either as principal or agent, sell tobacco at retail at any place other than a place of business designated in a valid, subsisting license, issued to such person; Provided that nothing in this or the next preceding Regulation shall be construed to prohibit or restrict the solicitation of orders for or the sale of tobacco by a licensed wholesale vendor to a licensed retail vendor at any place.\n***\n12. No person shall sell tobacco at retail elsewhere than a named place of business, either as principal or as agent, without having obtained an itinerant salesman's license. No person shall sell tobacco at retail elsewhere than a named place of business through an agent or salesman unless such agent or salesman is the holder of a valid subsisting itinerant salesman's license.\n***\n19. Every licensed retail vendor is hereby constituted an agent of the Minister for the collection of the tax and shall collect the tax from the consumer at the time of purchase of tobacco by the consumer.\n***\n22. The retail vendor or his agent shall deliver to every purchaser, at the time of the sale, a receipt for the tax collected and no sale shall be made unless such receipt is given.\n*** 30. No person shall purchase tobacco at retail without paying the tax or accept delivery of same without receiving from the retail vendor a receipt for such tax in accordance with the provisions of the Act and these Regulations.\nThe grounds of appeal raised by the appellant before this Court were as follows:\n1. The Act is not legislation upon the matters assigned to the legislative jurisdiction of the province by sec. 92 of the British North America Act, but is in fact legislation upon matters within the exclusive legislative jurisdiction of the Dominion of Canada by virtue of sec. 91 of the British North America Act.\n2. The Act purports to impose a tax for the raising of a revenue for provincial purposes, but such tax is neither,\n(a) a direct tax, nor\n(b) a tax within the province\nas authorized by subsection 2 of sec. 92 of the British North America Act.\n3. The tax is not confined in its effect to the province of New Brunswick nor to the persons upon whom it is levied.\n4. The Act infringes upon the exclusive legislative jurisdiction of the Dominion of Canada to impose customs and excise duties.\n5. The Act purports, in violation of the provisions of sec. 121 of the British North America Act, to impose a tax upon articles grown, produced or manufactured in another province of Canada when introduced into New Brunswick for purposes of consumption.\n6. The licences provided for in the Act in question are not within the category of shop, saloon, tavern, auctioneer or other licenses in order to the raising of a revenue for provincial, local or municipal purposes under sec. 92 subsection 9 of the British North America Act.\n7. The Regulations are invalid because the statute which authorizes them is wholly ultra vires.\nW. F. Chipman K.C. and J. F. H. Teed K.C. for the appellant.\nPeter J. Hughes K.C. for the respondents.\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. and R. Genest K.C. for the Attorney-General for Quebec.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Davis J. was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice\u2014It is necessary first to ascertain the characteristics of the tax, the validity of which is in question. The charging sections are sections 4 and 5 which must be read in light of the meanings attached to the phrases therein employed by the interpretation section. Sections 4 and 5 are as follows:\u2014\n4. Every consumer of tobacco purchased at a retail sale in the Province shall pay to His Majesty the King in the right of the Province for the raising of a revenue, at the time of making his purchase, a tax in respect of the consumption of such tobacco, and such tax shall be computed at the rate of ten per centum of the retail price of the tobacco purchased.\n5. Every person residing or ordinarily resident or carrying on business in New Brunswick, who brings into the Province or who receives delivery in the Province of tobacco for his own consumption or for the consumption of other persons at his expense or on behalf of or as agent for a principal who desires to acquire such tobacco for consumption by such principal or other person at his expense shall immediately report the matter to the Minister and forward or produce to him the invoice, if any, in respect of such tobacco and any other information required by the Minister with respect to the tobacco and shall pay the same tax in respect of the consumption of such tobacco as would have been payable if the tobacco had been purchased at a retail sale in the Province at the same price.\nThe material provisions of the interpretation section are 2 (a), (d) and (e), which are in the following words:\u2014\n2. (a) \"Consumer\" or \"Consumer of Tobacco\" means any person who within the Province, purchases from a vendor tobacco at a retail sale in the Province for his own consumption or for the consumption of other persons at his expense or who, within the Province, purchases from a vendor tobacco at a retail sale in the Province on behalf of or as agent for a principal who desires to acquire such tobacco for consumption by such principal or other persons at the expense of such principal.\n(d) \"Purchaser\" means any person who, within the Province, purchases from a retail vendor tobacco at a retail sale in the Province.\n(e) \"Retail Sale\" means a sale to a consumer for purposes of consumption and not for resale.\nSection 8 provides that the tax shall be collected, accounted for and paid to the Minister by such persons, at such times and in such manner as the regulations may prescribe. The statute provides for the licensing of vendors and inter alia by section 3, subsection (2) that no person shall sell tobacco at a retail sale unless he holds a retail vendor's license.\nThe regulations, which have the force of statute (section 20, subsection 2)) provide (Regulations 5 and 6, Form II) that every application for a retail vendor's license shall contain an undertaking by the applicant to collect and remit the tax. The undertaking, in the Form, is that the applicant undertakes to act as agent for the Minister for the collection of the tax and to account to the province for all moneys so collected. On the license is printed a notice that failure on the part of a vendor to collect and remit the tax renders him liable to a fine and to imprisonment in default of payment. There are two forms of licenses, an itinerant salesman's license and a license to carry on the business of a retail vendor at a named place of business. The effect of Regulations 9 and 12 is that no person shall, either as principal or agent, sell tobacco at retail, other than a person having a license in one or other of these forms.\nThe regulations contain important provisions touching the payment of the tax. By Regulation 19 the licensed retail vendor is\nhereby constituted an agent of the Minister for the collection of the tax,\nand the Regulation also provides that the retail vendor\nshall collect the tax from the consumer at the time of purchase of tobacco by the consumer.\nBy Regulation 22 the retail vendor, or his agent, shall deliver to every purchaser at the time of the sale a receipt for the tax collected, and it also provides that no sale shall be made unless such receipt is given. By Regulation 30 it is enacted that\nno person shall purchase tobacco at retail without paying the tax,\nand it is further provided that no person shall \"accept delivery\" of tobacco\nwithout receiving from the retail vendor a receipt for such tax.\nThe condition of the obligation to pay under section 4 is that the tobacco in respect of which the liability arises has been purchased at a retail sale. It is true the section describes the purchaser as \"consumer,\" but consumer means, as we have seen, a person purchasing tobacco at a retail sale for his own consumption, or for the consumption of other persons at his expense. It is a condition of a legal purchase at a retail sale that the tax be paid and of a lawful delivery of the tobacco to a purchaser that a receipt of the tax be also delivered to him by the seller. There can be no legal purchase without the payment of the tax; there can be no legal sale without the delivery of a receipt for the tax. In the ordinary case, sales will be cash sales. The price demanded will be the \"price to the consumer,\" to use the words of section 7; that is to say, the price to the purchaser, which includes the amount of the tax, a sum which is earmarked as such, of course, by the delivery of the receipt. In a practical sense, as far as the purchaser is concerned, it is part of the price he pays for his tobacco. As regards the vendor, it is the sum for which he is accountable to the government and, in fact, it comes out of the \"price to the consumer\"\u2014the price to the purchaser.\nIn other words, the payment of the tax is not only a condition of legal purchase; it is an integral element in the transaction of sale and purchase passing from the purchaser to the vendor as part of the price to the purchaser.\nMoreover, the real security to the government for the payment of the tax is the vendor's responsibility. True enough, the statute declares that the consumer continues to be liable until the tax is collected, but the real sanction for the obligation of the purchaser lies in the fact that he cannot lawfully, or in practice, get his tobacco without paying the tax. There is no provision for keeping account of consumption. On the other hand, the vendor is obliged, as licensee, to keep account of his purchases, of his sales, of the tobacco he has on hand from time to time. Not only is his default in performing his duty to collect the tax a punishable offence, he must account for his stamps and as agent, under a contractual duty to collect the tax, he is directly responsible if he has made a sale of tobacco without performing that duty. The character of the tax, I think, can best be determined by considering the ordinary case and in the ordinary case, that is to say, in all but exceedingly few cases, the sale of tobacco by a licensed retail vendor will be carried out in the manner contemplated by the Act and the tax will be simply a predetermined fraction of the price to the purchaser which is paid to the vendor and by him remitted to the government. It seems to me to be proper to describe such a tax as a tax on tobacco in respect of the commercial dealing between the retail vendor and the purchaser.\nAs regards section 5, the tax is imposed upon the importer of tobacco who imports it for his own consumption, or the consumption of others at his expense and that, I think, is a tax on tobacco in respect of the import of it for consumption.\nTo turn now to the legal questions involved. Section 5 imposes an import duty applying to imports from other parts of Canada, as well as from places outside of Canada. Although not collected in a manner in which customs duties are collected by the Dominion Government in this country, it is of the nature of a duty of customs. In the Attorney-General for British Columbia v. McDonald Murphy Lumber Co.[5], Lord Macmillan, speaking for the Lords of the Judicial Committee, said:\u2014\nIn Wharton's Law Lexicon \"Customs\" are defined as \"duties charged upon commodities on their importation into or exportation out of a country,\" and a similar definition is given in Murray's New English Dictionary.\nI shall revert to section 5 after discussing the tax imposed by section 4.\nThe enactment in section 4 and the ancillary enactments in the statute and regulations are justified on the ground that they constitute legislation in relation to direct taxation within the province within the meaning of section 92 (2). The question whether the tax is an excise duty of the class falling within the exclusive authority of the Parliament of Canada to impose can be considered more conveniently with section 5.\nIf I may say so without presumption, the subject of direct and indirect taxation as it affects the application of section 92 (2) has been put in a very clear light in the judgment delivered by Lord Thankerton on behalf of the Lords of the Judicial Committee in the Attorney-General for British Columbia v. Kingcome Navigation Co. Ltd.[6]. At p. 55 it is said, after a review of some of the previous decisions of the Judicial Committee, these decisions, in their Lordships' opinion, make clear that if the tax is demanded from the\nvery person who it is intended or desired should pay it, the taxation is direct.\nHis Lordship proceeds to point out that in the case of typical direct taxes, the taxation on property and income, for example, mentioned by Lord Cave in the City of Halifax v. Fairbanks Estate[7], such taxes\nare imposed in respect of the particular taxpayer's interest in property or the taxpayer's own income, and they are a peculiar contribution upon him, and it is intended and desired that he shall pay it, though it is possible for him, by making his own arrangements to that end, to pass the burden on in the sense of the political economists.\nSuch taxes are contrasted with those as regards which the taxing authorities are indifferent as to who ultimately bears the burden, such as taxes in respect of transactions and taxes in respect of some dealing in commodities, such as their import or sale. The words of the judgment are these:\n* * * where the tax is imposed in respect of a transaction, the taxing authority is indifferent as to which of the parties to the transaction ultimately bears the burden, and, as Mill expresses it, it is not intended as a peculiar contribution upon the particular party selected to pay the tax. Similarly, where the tax is imposed in respect of some dealing with commodities, such as their import or sale, or production for sale, the tax is not a peculiar contribution upon the one of the parties to the trading in the particular commodity who is selected as the taxpayer.\nI have said sufficient to show why, in my opinon, the tax imposed by section 4 is a tax in respect of a dealing with tobacco, the sale and purchase of it, and this dealing falls, I think, within the class of dealings with commodities envisaged by such passages in their Lordships' judgment.\nOn behalf of the respondent it is said that this is a tax in respect of consumption and that it stands in the same category as that in question in the Attorney-General for British Columbia v. Kingcome Navigation Co. Ltd.[8]. The tax in question there was payable by every person who consumes fuel oil in the province in respect of the fuel oil consumed and at the rate of one-half cent a gallon. Every person consuming fuel oil was obliged to keep such books and records and furnish such returns as might be prescribed by the regulations, the failure to do so being a punishable offence. The amount of the tax was recoverable by action and in every such action the burden of proving the quantity consumed by the defendant was upon him. There are no such provisions in the statute before us. The tax is not payable by the consumer as such. It is payable by the purchaser, or the agent of the purchaser, and the statute itself contemplates that neither of them may be the consumer. No liability attaches to the consumer as such. To repeat, in the practical administration of the Act there can be no manner of doubt that the payment of the tax and the delivery of the receipt take place as acts in the transaction of sale and purchase. The matter of consumption never comes into question.\nOn behalf of the respondent it is argued that the purchase from the retail vendor is a purchase for consumption because the tobacco cannot lawfully be sold by the purchaser unless he takes out a vendor's license which insures that he can never sell except at a loss. There is no limit, however, as to the quantity which may be purchased from a retail vendor and any purchaser is entitled to obtain a license as a retail vendor and the license fee is only fifty cents. However, as a rule, tobacco sold at retail, in the ordinary sense, is purchased with the intention that it will be consumed by the purchaser, or his friends or associates, and the vast majority of the purchases of tobacco at retail will be purchased for immediate consumption.\nIt does not at all follow from this that the tax is a tax in respect of consumption, especially when it is so obviously a tax in respect of the sale and purchase. There is nothing in the statute, truly, which can fairly be said to give to the tax the character of a tax in respect of consumption, except the declaration of the legislature to that effect and some collateral provisions which are relied upon as supporting the contention that such is its character.\nI do not think too much importance can be attached to the declaration of the legislature that the tax is payable in respect of consumption. The British North America Act \"must have contemplated some tangible dividing line referable to and ascertainable by the general tendencies of the tax and the common understanding of men as to those tendencies\" (Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[9], City of Halifax v. Fairbanks' Estate[10]. Nor was it probably contemplated that the \"tangible dividing line\" between direct and indirect taxation could be shifted at will by the declarations of the legislature as to its expectations, or intentions, in respect of the ultimate incidence of a tax. It is especially important, I think, in the application of Mill's test not to be led away by legislative declarations, or collateral legislative provisions, imparting to the legislation a form calculated to give a colour of legality to the legislative effort.\nI return now to section 5. As I have said it imposes a duty in respect of import. Such a duty is one of those mentioned in the passage quoted from Lord Thankerton's judgment[11] as being not imposed as a peculiar contribution upon one of the parties and as being, consequently, an indirect tax. It seems clear, moreover, to be a tax within section 122. There were customs duties levied on manufactured tobacco by the provinces at the time of Confederation. The Dominion has always imposed customs duties in respect of imports of tobacco and it would seem an extraordinary thing if each one of the provinces could impose such duties upon persons who import for their own consumption and who should be obliged to pay this duty after paying the duty imposed by the Dominion; and equally extraordinary in the case of raw tobacco imported by an importer in Montreal, who has paid the customs duty upon it and manufactured it there, that it should, on shipment into New Brunswick to a consumer, be subjected to a further import duty in that province. The importation which brings section 5 into operation seems clearly to be a dealing in tobacco within the meaning of the judgment quoted above. So also, I think, the tax imposed by section 4 is an excise duty within the contemplation of that judgment. At pp. 58, 59, Lord Thankerton says:\u2014\nIn their Lordships' opinion the customs or excise duties on commodities ordinarily regarded as indirect taxation, referred to in the judgments in Fairbanks' case[12] and the McDonald Murphy Lumber Co.'s case[13], are duties which are imposed in respect of commercial dealings in commodities, and they would necessarily fall within Mill's definition of indirect taxes. They do not extend, for instance, to a dog tax, which is clearly direct taxation, though the machinery of the excise law might be applied to its collection, or to a license duty, such as was considered in Lambe's case[14]. Customs and excise duties are, in their essence, trading taxes, and may be said to be more concerned with the commodity in respect of which the taxation is imposed than with the particular person from whom the tax is exacted.\nThe tax imposed by section 4 fulfils the conditions of this \"definition of customs and excise duties,\" as the judgment describes this passage. The distinction between the New Brunswick statute and the provisions of the British Columbia Fuel-Oil Act, with which the judgment is concerned, is brought out very clearly in the part of the judgment I now quote at p. 59:\u2014\nTurning then to the provisions of the Fuel-Oil Act here in question, it is clear that the Act purports to exact the tax from a person who has consumed fuel-oil, the amount of the tax being computed broadly according to the amount consumed. The Act does not relate to any commercial transaction in the commodity between the taxpayer and some one else. Their Lordships are unable to find, on examination of the Act, any justification for the suggestion that the tax is truly imposed in respect of the transaction by which the taxpayer acquires the property in the fuel-oil nor in respect of any contract or arrangement under which the oil is consumed, though it is, of course, possible that individual taxpayers may recoup themselves by such a contract or arrangement; but this cannot effect the nature of the tax. Accordingly their Lordships are of opinion that the tax is direct taxation within the meaning of s. 92, head 2, of the British North America Act.\nI should add that section 5, in my opinion, comes within the ban of section 121. I do not think either the decision in the Gold Seal case[15], or the observations in the judgments, are in any way in conflict with this.\nThe duty imposed by section 5, as I have already observed, being a duty imposed by a provincial legislature, is, of course, not collected through the machinery of the customs, but levied in New Brunswick prior to Confederation it would have been levied as a customs duty; and considered even from the point of view of its application to goods imported from other provinces, it is of the nature of a customs duty, if the expression is properly applicable in such circumstances. Section 5 is moreover, in my opinion, an enactment in regulation of trade and commerce within the ambit of the exclusive authority in relation to that subject vested in the Dominion by section 91.\nI should add that the tax under section 4 is payable by the purchaser's agent where the purchase is made by an agent. On the principle of the Manitoba Grain case[16], this provision appears to be invalid.\nFor these reasons, I think the appeal should be allowed.\nRinfret J.\u2014The question in this case is about the constitutionality of \"An Act to provide for imposing a tax on the consumption of tobacco\" (c. 44 of the Acts of New Brunswick, 1940), hereinafter referred to as The Tobacco Tax Act.\nThe appellant caused a writ to issue in the Chancery Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick claiming an injunction restraining the defendants, and each of them, from entering upon the store premises of the appellant, in the city of Saint John, or from accosting, questioning, or otherwise interfering with customers of the appellant while on those premises, or on the streets adjacent thereto, with reference to any purchase of tobacco, or the payment of any tobacco tax under the authority of the Act above mentioned, or the regulations under it.\nThe parties concurred in stating the questions arising for the opinion of the Court as follows:\nThe appellant is a Dominion company having its head office in the city of Saint John, in the province of New Brunswick.\nOn May 11, 1940, the legislature of the province of New Brunswick enacted The Tobacco Tax Act, which came into force on October 1st, 1940, by proclamation of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council.\nCertain regulations were made under the authority of the Act.\nOn October 15, 1940, the appellant opened a store, in the city of Saint John, and thereafter carried on, and now carries on, therein the business of selling tobacco, including cigars and cigarettes, without having obtained any license so to do under The Tobacco Tax Act, or the regulations.\nIn its store, the appellant sells at retail sale tobacco, including cigars and cigarettes, manufactured in provinces of Canada other than the province of New Brunswick, to persons defined, by section 2 (a) of the said Tobacco Tax Act, as \"consumers\" or \"consumers of tobacco,\" without collecting the tax imposed by the said Act.\nThe respondent James H. Conlon was, on the coming into force of the said Tobacco Tax Act, appointed to the office of Tobacco Tax Commissioner, it being an office created under the regulations.\nOn November 2, 1940, and from time to time thereafter, the respondent John McDonough, an inspector appointed under the Act, and others, while acting under the instructions of the other respondents, entered upon the appellant's premises and proceeded to question customers of the appellant as to whether they had paid the tax on the tobacco purchased by them, to ask them to produce their tobacco tax receipt and to demand their names and addresses. They refused to leave the premises when requested so to do by the appellant, and claimed that they were entitled to remain therein and to question customers by virtue of the said Tobacco Act and the regulations made thereunder. By reason of these actions of the respondents, the business of the appellant has been and is now injuriously affected.\nThe question for the opinion of the Court is whether the Tobacco Tax Act, or any of the provisions thereof, and the regulations made thereunder, or any of them, are ultra vires of the legislature of New Brunswick; and, if so, in what particular, or particulars.\nIt was agreed that, if the Court should be of the opinion that the Act and the regulations were wholly intra vires, the appellant's action should be dismissed. If the Court should be of opinion that the Act and the regulations are wholly ultra vires, judgment should be entered in favour of the appellant and against the respondents for an injunction order in the terms of the writ of summons herein. If the Court should be of opinion that the Act or regulations, or any of them, are intra vires in part and ultra vires in part, the Court should make such Order by way of declaration or of substantive relief to the appellant, as shall be deemed right and proper.\nThe special case was submitted to the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court; and, after argument heard, the judgment of that Court was delivered by the Chief Justice of the province of New Brunswick, in which Grimmer and Richards JJ. concurred.\nThe Court unanimously held that the Act was within the constitutional powers of the Province.\nAfter having quoted the material sections of the Act, the learned Chief Justice stated that the regulations had not been attacked, except upon the ground that, the Act being ultra vires, they fell with it.\nHe proceeded to enumerate the grounds of objection to the validity of the Act:\n(1) That the transaction was not within the Province;\n(2) That it was an attempt to impose a tax upon inter-provincial or international transactions;\n(3) That dealers in tobacco could not without their consent be constituted agents for the Crown for the collection of a tax, as it would constitute them public officers;\n(4) That the tax was indirect as falling upon transactions in commodities especially; (5) That it was an indirect tax as being in essence a sales tax;\n(6) That the taxation of an agent was vital to the scheme of the Act and that taxation so imposed upon an agent gave him a right to be indemnified by his principal, thus indirectly imposing the tax upon the principal.\nDealing first with grounds of objection 1 and 2, the judgment failed to see that the legislature had attempted to impose a customs duty upon the importation of tobacco into the Province, contrary to the contention of counsel for the appellant. In the opinion of the Appeal Division, the legislation did not purport to affect any person who was outside of the Province, nor the commodity when it was not within the Province. In fact, it did not affect the commodity at all.\nAs to objection no. 3, the Court thought that it also failed and that it must be competent for the legislature to provide for collectors of revenue, if that revenue derives from a direct tax.\nObjections 4 and 5 were taken together. In the Court's opinion, they raised the only real point in the case, viz.: Whether the statute imposes direct or indirect taxation.\nThe attempt made to treat the Act as imposing a stamp tax and thus bringing it within Attorney-General for Quebec v. Queen Insurance Company[17], and Attorney-General for Quebec v. Read[18], was disregarded. It was said by the Court that what was called a \"stamp\" in argument is not a stamp at all. It was not regarded as such nor intended to be affixed to anything. It was simply a receipt for payment; and Regulation 20 was referred to.\nAs to the attempt of counsel for the appellant to assimilate the tax to a sales tax, and, therefore, to an indirect tax, the Court thought that transmissibility is the proper test for the present case. On this ground, reference was made to Attorney-General for Manitoba v. Attorney-General for Canada[19], where the tax was on persons selling grain for future delivery; and to Attorney-General for British Columbia v. Canadian Pacific Railway[20], where the Privy Council stated that fuel-oil, being a marketable commodity, those who purchased it, even for their own use, acquired a right to take it into the market; and that, therefore, a tax levied on the first purchasers of fuel-oil came within the general principle which determines that the tax is an indirect one.\nReference was also made by the learned Chief Justice to Rex. v. Caledonian Collieries Ltd.[21], which dealt with a percentage tax imposed on mine owners on the gross revenue of coal mines, and where it was held that the general tendency of the tax upon the sums received from the sale of the commodity which the mine owners produced was that they would seek to recover it in the price charged to the purchaser, and that, although, under the particular circumstances, the recovery of the tax be economically undesirable or practically impossible, nevertheless the general tendency of the tax remained. The effect of the Privy Council decision in Lower Mainland Dairy v. Crystal Dairy[22], and of the decision of this Court in Lawson v. Interior Tree Fruit and Vegetable Committee of Direction[23], was also examined; and the Court found that the cases were not in the same category as the present case.\nThe Court then discussed the judgment of Lord Thankerton in Attorney-General for British Columbia v. Kingcome Navigation Company[24], where the noble Lord reviewed previous judgments of the Board and said that:\nThese decisions made clear that if the tax is demanded from the very persons who it is intended or desired should pay it, the taxation is direct, and that it is none the less direct, even if it might be described as an excise tax, for instance, or is collected as an excise tax.\n***\nThe ultimate incidence of the tax, in the sense of the political economist\/is to be disregarded, but where the tax is imposed in respect of a transaction, the taxing authority is indifferent as to which of the parties in the transaction ultimately bears the burden, and, as Mill expresses it, it is not intended as a peculiar contribution upon the particular party selected to pay the tax. Similarly, where the tax is imposed in respect of some dealing with commodities, such as their import or sale, or production for sale, the tax is not a peculiar contribution upon that one of the parties to the trading in the particular commodity who is selected as the taxpayer.\nOf the Fuel Oil Tax Act of British Columbia, Lord Thankerton said that it was clear that the Act purported to exact the tax from a person who had consumed fuel-oil, the amount of the tax being computed broadly according to the amount consumed, and the Act did not relate to any commercial transaction in the commodity between the taxpayer and someone else. Although it was, of course, possible that individual taxpayers may recoup themselves by the contract or arrangements under which the oil was acquired, this could not, in their Lordships' opinion, affect the nature of the tax.\nThe Appeal Division, in the present case, then pointed out that the differences between the Act considered by the Privy Council in the Kingcome case[25] and the case at present under review were two:\nFirstly, the British Columbia tax was imposed upon the person \"who has consumed fuel-oil\"; the New Brunswick Act imposed the duty \"before consumption of the commodity.\" It was shown that by actual consumption, under the British Columbia Act, the purchaser became the ultimate consumer. The Appeal Division thought that the same result was attained by the express provisions of sec. 3 (2) of the New Brunswick Act, which took away the right of resale from the purchaser from a retail dealer. The statute thereby made him the ultimate consumer. As a result of that action, it seemed impossible to conceive that the purchaser attempting to resell could have a market, unless he was prepared to sell the commodity at a definite loss.\nSecondly, there was no definition of the word \"consumer\" in the British Columbia Act, and obviously there could be none, while section 2 (a) of the New Brunswick Act contained a definition and by it the consumer could purchase from a vendor by \"means of an agent.\" The principal must be one who desires to acquire the tobacco for consumption by himself, or by other persons at his expense. The appellant contended that the tax necessarily paid by the agent would be \"passed on\" to the principal, which would bring the transaction within the trading cases to which reference has already been made. To this argument, the Court thought the answer was: \"That there is not, and cannot be, a sale by the agent to his principal.\" True, the agent, if he had not the required money in advance, would be entitled to be indemnified by his principal; but indemnity is not sale. \"Qui facit per alium facit per se\" applies. This is only part of the machinery of the Act. Forbes v. Attorney-General of Manitoba[26]. Summing up, the learned Chief Justice came to the conclusion that the tax was not imposed upon the vendor, it was not imposed upon the goods; it was imposed upon the consumer, and measured and valued by the extent of his purchases. The consumer paid the tax at the time of the sale to him. The vendor paid no tax; and the tax could not by any possibility enter as a factor into the price charged by him. That there was a perception of the tax at the moment that the commodity passed from the vendor to the buyer did not make it a sales tax. It seemed to fall within the class of excise taxes which may be levied by a provincial legislature. But it was immaterial how it was described; the incidence of the tax fell upon and was borne by the ultimate consumer and could not be passed on.\nFor these reasons, the Court held that the Act was within the constitutional power of the Province.\nFrom that judgment, Atlantic Smoke Shops now appeals to this Court by special leave granted therefor by the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick; and the Attorney-General of the province of Quebec intervenes to support the constitutionality of the New Brunswick Act, in view of the fact that the legislature of Quebec has adopted a similar statute.\nThe Tobacco Tax Act now in question enacts, in sec. 3, that\n(2) No person shall sell any tobacco in the Province at a retail sale unless he holds a retail vendor's license issued to him under the authority of this Act and such license is in force at the time of sale;\n(3) No wholesale vendor shall sell any tobacco in the Province to a person who is not a vendor duly licensed under this Act.\nBy section 4, it is enacted that\n4. Every consumer of tobacco purchased at a retail sale in the Province shall pay to His Majesty the King in the right of the Province for the raising of a revenue, at the time of making his purchase, a tax in respect of the consumption of such tobacco, and such tax shall be computed at the rate of ten per centum of the retail price of the tobacco purchases.\nBy section 5:\n5. Every person residing or ordinarily resident or carrying on business in New Brunswick, who brings into the Province or who receives delivery in the Province of tobacco for his own consumption or for the consumption of other persons at his expense or on behalf of or as agent for a principal who desires to acquire such tobacco for consumption by such principal or other persons at his expense shall immediately report the matter to the Minister and forward or produce to him the invoice, if any, in respect of such tobacco and any other information required by the Minister with respect to the tobacco and shall pay the same tax in respect of the consumption of such tobacco as would have been payable if the tobacco had been purchased at a retail sale in the Province at the same price.\nIn the Act, \"Consumer\" or \"Consumer of tobacco\"\nmeans any person who, within the Province, purchases from a vendor tobacco at a retail sale in the Province for his own consumption or for the consumption of other persons at his expense or who, within the Province, purchases from a vendor tobacco at a retail sale in the Province, on behalf of or as agent for a principal who desires to acquire such tobacco for consumption by such principal or other persons at the expense of such principal. (Section 2a).\n\"Purchaser\" means any person who, within the Province, purchases from a retail vendor tobacco at a retail sale in the Province (Section 2d).\n\"Retail sale\" means a sale to a consumer for purposes of consumption and not for resale (Section 2e).\n\"Retail vendor\" means any person who, within the Province sells tobacco to a consumer (Section 2f).\nBy section 7:\n7. No retail vendor shall advertise or hold out or state to the public or to any consumer, directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof imposed by this Act will be assumed or absorbed by the retail vendor or that it will not be considered as an element in the price to the consumer or, if added, that it or any part thereof will be refunded.\nBy section 9:\n9. The Minister may make such allowance as the Lieutenant-Governor in Council may determine to vendors for their services in collecting the tax.\nAnd finally, by section 10:\n10. A consumer shall be and remain liable for the tax imposed by this Act until the same has been collected.\nFor the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of the Act, the Lieutenant-Governor in Council was authorized to make such regulations, not inconsistent with the spirit of the Act, as were considered necessary, or advisable (section 20); and, amongst other things, for\n(a) providing for the affixing of stamps on tobacco or on the packages in which it was sold, before or at the time it is sold to the consumer, as evidence of the tax having been paid;\nand it is enacted that such regulations shall have the same force and effect as if enacted by the Act and that they shall be published in the Royal Gazette (section 20-2). Of the regulations so made, only the following should be quoted:\n19. Every licensed retail vendor is hereby constituted an agent of the Minister for the collection of the tax and shall collect the tax from the consumer, etc.\n23. The retail vendor shall account for and remit the amount of tax collected to the Tobacco Tax Commissioner within ten days immediately following the calendar month during which any sale has taken place and shall with his remittance forward to the Tobacco Tax Commissioner a statement containing the information required by Form 4 in the Schedule of these regulations.\nRetail vendors are required to make an application for the license to sell at retail. That application is signed by them and the form so signed contains the following undertaking:\nI\/we hereby make application for a license as indicated above under the provisions of The Tobacco Tax Act, 1940.\nI\/we, upon acceptance of license to retail tobacco, agree and undertake to act as the agent of the Minister for the collection of the tax imposed by said Act and to account to the Province of New Brunswick for all moneys so collected, as provided by the Act and Regulations.\nThe form of license itself contains the following prescriptions:\nPenalty as prescribed by the Act.\nFailure on the part of a vendor to collect the tax renders him liable to a fine of not less than ten or more than five hundred dollars, and costs; and, in default of payment, to imprisonment to a term not exceeding three months.\nThe form of tobacco tax return provides for the deduction of a commission of 3%, being the allowance to the vendor for his services in collecting the tax; and it contains the following:\nEnclosed find the sum of $***which is the amount of Tobacco Tax collected by me during the month of after deductions being made as described above.\nAnd attached to the return is a declaration which has to be signed by the vendor to the effect that the remittance is a true return of all taxable sales made during the last preceding months, and that the return herein truly represents all tax imposable by law accruing upon such sales or transactions as are chargeable under the Tobacco Tax Act.\nThe attack made upon that Act by the appellant and the grounds of appeal from the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, which upheld the Act, are: (1) The Act is not legislation upon the matters assigned to the legislative jurisdiction of the provinces by sec. 92 of the British North America Act;\n(2) The Act purports to impose a tax for the raising of a revenue for provincial purposes, but it is neither\n(a) a direct tax, or\n(b) a tax within the Province,\nas authorized by subsection 2 of section 92;\n(3) The tax is not confined in its effect to the province of New Brunswick, nor to the persons upon whom it is levied;\n(4) The Act infringes upon the exclusive legislative jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament to impose customs or excise duties;\n(5) The Act purports, in violation of the provisions of section 121 of the British North America Act, to impose a tax upon articles grown, produced or manufactured in other provinces of Canada when introduced into New Brunswick for purposes of consumption;\n(6) The licenses provided for in the Act in question are not within the category of shop, saloon, tavern, auctioneer or other licenses in order to the raising of a revenue for provincial, local or municipal purposes under section 92, subsection 9, of the British North America Act.\n(7) The Regulations are invalid because the statute which authorizes them is wholly ultra vires.\nIt is to be observed, as already pointed out in the reasons for judgment of the Appeal Division, that the regulations are not brought into question except in so far as they are authorized by the statute and that they will have to be found ultra vires only if the statute itself is held unconstitutional. They may, therefore, be disregarded for the purpose of the present discussion; and that disposes of ground of appeal no. 7.\nGround no. 1 is only a general statement of the objections of the appellant, the details of which are enumerated in grounds 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. Those, therefore, are the grounds which have to be examined in order to decide the present appeal. It is alleged in ground of appeal no. 2 that the tax imposed is not a direct tax, contrary to the powers of a provincial legislature under head 2 of sec. 92.\n\"Direct taxation\" alone may be imposed by a Province, and it must be \"taxation within the Province\".\nIt was said by this Court, in City of Charlottetown v. Foundation Maritime Limited[27]:\nIt is no longer open to discussion, on account of the successive decisions of the Privy Council, that the formula of John Stuart Mill (Political Economy ed., 1886, vol. II, p. 415) has been judicially adopted as affording a guide to the application of section 92, head 2 (Fairbanks case[28]). Mill's definition was held to embody \"the most obvious indicia of direct and indirect taxation\" and was accepted as providing a logical basis for the distinction to be made between the two (Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[29]). The expression \"indirect taxation\" connotes the idea of a tax imposed on a person who is not supposed to bear it himself but who will seek to recover it in the price charged to another. And Mill's canon is founded on the theory of the ultimate incidence of the tax, not the ultimate incidence depending upon the special circumstances of individual cases, but the incidence of the tax in its ordinary and normal operation. It may be possible in particular cases to shift the burden of a direct tax, or it may happen, in particular circumstances, that it might be economically undesirable or practically impossible to pass it on (The King v. Caledonian Collieries[30]). It is the normal or general tendency of the tax that will determine, and the expectation or the intention that the person from whom the tax is demanded shall indemnify himself at the expense of another might be inferred from the form in which the tax is imposed or from the results which in the ordinary course of business transactions must be held to have been contemplated.\nThe definition of John Stuart Mill, above referred to, states:\nTaxes are direct or indirect. A direct tax is one which is demanded from the very persons who it is intended or desired should pay it. Indirect taxes are those which are demanded from one person in the expectation and intention that he shall indemnify himself at the expense of another; such as the excise or customs.\nNow the appellant contends that the tax we are now examining comes under the definition of an indirect tax because it is imposed upon the taxpayer with respect to, and by reason of, his entering into a commercial transaction or trade in commodities; also because it taxes all agents who purchase tobacco on behalf of their principals or who bring tobacco into the province of New Brunswick on behalf of their principals. Of course, the question of the nature of the tax is one of substance. It does not turn only on the language used by the legislature which imposed it; and in testing the validity of the statute, the first requisite is to ascertain the real nature of the tax imposed.\nIt may be admitted as a principle, which generally proves to be true, that a tax upon a person with respect to his consumption of some commodity within the Province is direct taxation and intra vires, even although, in some instances and circuituously, he is enabled to pass the burden on to someone else.\nIt may be assumed that, generally speaking, a tax upon a person with respect to a commercial transaction, such as a sale or purchase, based upon and with respect to the price of the commodity, is indirect taxation and ultra vires of a province, even although, in some instances, the party taxed may not pass the burden to anyone else.\nIn the Kingcome case[31], the tax was imposed on the consumer of fuel oil according to the quantity which he consumed within the province. It was held that this was direct taxation and intra vires. The British Columbia Act, in their Lordships' view, did not relate to any transaction in the commodity between the taxpayer and some one else.\nHere, the appellant argues that the tax is upon the purchaser of commodities, imposed at the time of the purchase, and with respect to the commodity purchased; and that it is accordingly an indirect tax and ultra vires. He relies on a long line of decisions of the Privy Council upholding this principle.\nIf we turn to the New Brunswick statute, we find that the charging section (sec. 4) imposes the tax only on the consumer of tobacco, in respect of the consumption of such tobacco, and computed at the rate of ten per centum of the retail price of the tobacco purchased.\nThe statute makes it clear that the only person who it is intended or desired should be taxed is the consumer. It is just as much a consumption tax as was the British Columbia tax in the Kingcome case31.\nFor the purpose of deciding whether such a tax is a direct or an indirect tax, it does not matter that the tax is imposed before or after consumption of the commodity. The point is that the tax is imposed in respect of the actual consumption, that the legislature intends that it should be a tax with respect to consumption and that the language of the statute is so guarded that, except in extremely exceptional and almost inconceivable cases, it makes it impossible for the consumer to pass it on to someone else, or, in the words of Mill, to \"indemnify himself at the expense of another.\"\nIn fact, the statute is framed in such a way that the legislature has indicated its intention that the person on whom the tax is imposed will bear it himself; and it has taken every precaution to prevent the consumer from indemnifying himself at the expense of another. This must be inferred both from the form in which the tax is imposed and from the results which, in the ordinary course of business transactions must be held to have been contemplated. Indeed, it may not only be inferred from the statute itself, but it is there expressly so stated.\nThe consumer who is taxed is a person who, within the province, purchases tobacco at a retail sale, in the province, for consumption of himself, or of other persons at his expense. By definition, \"purchaser\" means a person within the Province purchasing from a retail vendor at a retail sale in the Province. A \"retail vendor\" means a person, within the Province, selling tobacco to a consumer, and that is to say: a person who holds a retail vendor's licence, issued to him under the authority of the Act, and whose licence is in force at the time of the sale. And, also by definition, a \"retail sale\" means a sale to a consumer for purposes of consumption and not for resale.\nThe right of the consumer to resell is taken away by the provisions of the Act, thus meeting the possibility suggested by Viscount Haldane, in Attorney-General for British Columbia v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[32]. It was stated in that case that\nit may be true that, having regard to the practice of the respondents, the oil they purchase is used by themselves alone and is not at present resold. But the respondents might develop their business so as to resell the oil they have bought. The principle of construction as established is satisfied if this is practicable and does not for its application depend on the special circumstances of individual cases. In the present case, this possibility has been provided against; and no legal resale by the consumer may take place within the province. Not only that; but the fact that the tax is imposed upon a consumer purchasing at a retail sale, in view of the definition of the words \"retail sale\" in the Act, means that the tax is imposed only in respect of a \"sale to a consumer for purposes of consumption and not for resale\"; and it follows that if some alleged consumer purchased tobacco with the concealed intention of reselling it, he might, as a consequence, become open to a penalty for violating the Act; but he would not, within the precise terms of the Act, come under the provisions of the charging section (sec. 4), and conceivably he might not render himself liable to the tax.\nHere, on account of the prescriptions of the Act, the possibility of a resale cannot be said to be according to the common understanding of men; and the legislature, by its statute, has taken every means to provide against that possibility. The King v. Nat Bells Liquors Ltd.[33].\nIt is the general tendency of the legislation that must be considered, and exceptional cases must be ignored. The suggestion made by the appellant that the purchaser may go outside the province and resell there can hardly be entertained. Section 4, read with sections 2 (a) and 2 (e), imposes the tax on one who purchases in the Province for consumption there. The purchaser may exceptionally go outside and consume the tobacco sold in the province; but this would be an exceptional case resulting from the free act of the purchaser once he has become the absolute owner of the tobacco; and this isolated case cannot make of the statute one imposing a tax outside the province.\nThe effect of the tax is intended to be confined to the province of New Brunswick. It is imposed upon the consumers of tobacco in New Brunswick; and it does not pretend to have any effect at all outside the province.\nBut it is argued that the tax is indirect because the Act taxes the agent with respect to his transaction on behalf of his principal; and the Privy Council's decisions in Cotton v. The King[34], and in Attorney-General for Manitoba v. Attorney-General for Canada[35], and in Provincial Treasurer of Alberta v. Kerr[36], are relied on. The Act taxes the \"consumer\"; and, by definition, \"Consumer\" includes a person who\nwithin the Province, purchases from a vendor tobacco at a retail sale in the Province for his own consumption or for the consumption of other persons at his expense or who, within the Province purchases * * * on behalf of or as agent for a principal who desires to acquire such tobacco for consumption by such principal or other persons at the expense of such principal.\nAnd the Act further says that a consumer, and therefore an agent, in the circumstances within the definition,\nshall be and remain liable for the tax imposed by this Act until the sale has been collected.\nFrom a practical point of view, it may be said that this feature of the Act, so far as it is made a point against its constitutionality, is almost negligible.\nUnder the Act, the\ntax shall be computed at the rate of ten per centum of the retail price of the tobacco purchased.\n(section 4). The circumstance no doubt contemplated by the Act, when a person would purchase tobacco \"on behalf of or as agent for a principal,\" would be where the purchaser sends a messenger to a tobacco store, with the object of buying for him the tobacco which he intends to consume. The purchasers meant to be so covered are purchasers of tobacco \"at a retail sale,\" and \"for consumption\" by the principal. In ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, the tax, in such cases, would amount to something between ten to fifty cents, the latter being an extreme suggestion. It is to be assumed that, in almost every case, the messenger would have received his principal's money to pay both for the tobacco and for the tax. The amount of the tax, at all events, would be but a trifle; and the instances where it may happen that the messenger would advance the money would be extremely scarce. I would be very loath to declare a provincial statute unconstitutional on such a slim objection.\nMoreover, it is very doubtful whether the occurrence in such a case could really be described as \"passing on.\" This, to my mind, is not the kind of \"passing on\" deemed to be, in the decided cases, the characteristic of an indirect tax. The \"agent,\" in this instance, would not be paying for himself, but for and on behalf of the principal. There would be, as a consequence, no enhancement of the actual cost as between the agent and his principal.\nMoreover, should this feature of the Act be found unconstitutional\u2014which, in my view, it should not\u2014it is severable, and it may not be allowed to defeat either the whole Act or its principle. The objection would be met by deleting the provision concerning agents in the definition of \"consumer.\" As the tax must be paid immediately \"at the time of making the purchase,\" no valid retail sale may be made without the tax being paid at once, and there is no perceivable object in enacting that the agent will remain responsible for it.\nI have now discussed the grounds of appeal nos. 1, 2 and 3. The others do not require elaborate consideration.\nAs to ground no. 4, I cannot agree that the Act infringes upon the exclusive legislative jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada to impose customs and excise duties. Section 5 of the Act is relied on for the appellant's argument on this point. It provides that a\nperson residing or ordinarily resident or carrying on business in New Brunswick, who brings into the province or who receives delivery in the province of tobacco for his own consumption or for a principal who desires to acquire such tobacco for consumption by such principal or other persons at his expense, shall immediately report the matter to the Minister and forward or produce to him the invoice in respect of such tobacco, etc. * * * and shall pay the same tax in respect of the consumption of such tobacco as would have been payable if the tobacco had been purchased at a retail sale in the province at the same price.\nIn regard to this, it should be observed that it affects only persons residing, or ordinarily resident, or carrying on business in New Brunswick. But it is argued that, since it covers such a person\nwho brings into the province, or who receives delivery in the province\nof tobacco from outside, the tax is an attempt to impose customs duties, which are of the exclusive competency of the Dominion Parliament.\nI do not think that it is a customs duty within the meaning of those words as they are generally understood.\nUnder section 5, the tax is not collected at the border of New Brunswick, or before the tobacco is allowed to enter the territory of the Province. That section covers the case of a resident of New Brunswick, or of a person carrying on business therein, who brings into the Province tobacco\nfor his own consumption, or for the consumption of other persons at his own expense.\nThe consumer of tobacco is not called upon to pay the tax before the tobacco comes into the province, or before he receives possession of the tobacco. He pays after delivery, or after he has come into possession. Surely there must be a moment when property entering a province becomes property in the province subject to be taxed by the province.\nTo my mind, section 5 has no other purpose than to equalize between purchasers in the Province and purchasers residing in New Brunswick who happen to have purchased tobacco outside of it. It may be styled legislation incidental to the scheme of The Tobacco Tax Act; it cannot be regarded as imposing a customs duty.\nThen, as ground of appeal no. 5, the appellant urges that the Act purports, in violation of the provisions of section 121 of the British North America Act, to impose a tax upon articles grown, produced or manufactured in any one of the provinces, when introduced into the province of New Brunswick for purposes of consumption.\nUnder the provisions of the Act, tobacco enters perfectly free into the Province; but the consumer is taxed in connection with the consumption of a commodity which is in the consumer's possession in the Province. The legislature has assumed that one who acquires for the purpose of consumption will consume. The exceptional cases where he might change his mind after introducing into the province the tobacco he has purchased for consumption are legitimately ignored by the legislature.\nIt would seem further that section 121 of the British North America Act only aims at the prohibition of customs duties when the articles of the growth, produce or manufacture of any one of the provinces are carried into any other province (Gold Seal Ltd. v. Dominion Express Company & The Attorney-General of the province of Alberta[37]. On the occasion of their importation from other provinces, the admission into the province must be free and that is to say that no tax or duty can be imposed as a condition of such admission (The King v. Nat Bell Liquors Ltd.[38]).\nIncidentally, it need hardly be said that the invalidity of section 5 could not affect the rest of the statute (Toronto Corporation v. York Corporation[39]).\nThe last ground of appeal is that the license required from the vendors is not one authorized by Head 9 of sec. 92 of the British North America Act.\nIt has been repeatedly held that the licenses specifically enumerated in Head 9 of section 92 are not the only licenses which provincial legislatures may provide for. It has been held also that the words \"other licenses\" in sub-head 9 are not limited to licenses ejusdem generis (Brewers & Malsters Association v. Attorney-General for Ontario[40]; Attorney-General for Manitoba v. Manitoba License Holders Association[41]; Shannon v. Lower Mainland Dairy Products Board[42]). Provincial legislatures can provide for licenses not only for the purpose of revenue, but also for the purpose of regulating matters within their powers. For example, they have the power of requiring licenses as an incident of any of their other powers, apart from the power to require licenses merely for the purpose of raising a revenue.\nA license can, therefore, be required by a Province as a means of collecting a tax which is valid, or as a means of compelling those who are entrusted with the duty of collecting a tax to comply with that duty. Such is the case here. It may be said, as a matter of fact, that the license required under The Tobacco Tax Act is a means of enabling the Province to possess a list of the names of the agents who are entrusted with the collection of the tax.\nIn the Kingcome Navigation case[43], the statute there considered also provided for a license.\nUnder all the circumstances, I think that the judgment appealed from was right and The Tobacco Tax Act was competently enacted by the legislature of the province of New Brunswick. The appeal should, therefore, be dismissed with costs, except that there will be no costs to the Intervenant, the Attorney-General of the province of Quebec.\nCrocket J.\u2014I agree with my brother Rinfret and the judgment of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick that The Tobacco Tax Act, as enacted by the Legislature of that Province, is wholly intra vires.\nMy brother Rinfret has so methodically and exhaustively dealt with the various points involved in the appeal as argued before us that, agreeing with him, as I do, in all his conclusions thereon, I find it difficult to state my own reasons for arriving at the same conclusion without reiterating much of what he has so pointedly said. However, in the circumstances, I feel, even at that risk, I should do so.\nApart from the objection that the vendors' licenses provided for by the statute are not licenses within the meaning of s. 92 (9) of the B.N.A. Act, all the grounds upon which its constitutional validity was challenged here, as in the court below, centre around the question as to whether the tax thereby imposed is a direct tax within the meaning of s. 92 (2) of that Act.\nAs to the nature or form of the tax imposed, the appellant of course contends that it is an \"indirect,\" rather than a \"direct\" tax, for the reason that it arises out of a commercial or trading transaction, to which the intended taxpayer is a party, and that it therefore falls within the meaning of the so-called trading cases, which were so strongly relied upon to support the appeal, as well as for the reason that upon the true construction of s. 2 (a) the tax is imposed, not only upon the purchasing prospective consumer, but alternatively upon his agent in making the purchase for him. As to the cases thus relied upon, it will be found on examination that they all proceed upon the ground that, although a tax purports to be imposed upon one party to a commercial or trading transaction, its real nature is determinable by the practicability of its being passed on to other persons by means of a resale and thus absorbed in the purchase price obtained on its resale. The pronouncement of Viscount Haldane in Attorney-General for British Columbia v. Canadian Pacific Railway Company[44] was especially relied upon in this regard, as stated by my brother Rinfret.\nIn the present case, as Baxter C.J., in the court below distinctly held, and as clearly appears from the very careful analysis my learned brother here has made of the relevant provisions of the New Brunswick Act, this possibility has been definitely eliminated by the statute itself.\nNot only does s. 3(2) expressly enact that\nno person shall sell any tobacco in the province at a retail sale unless he holds a vendor's license issued to him under authority of this Act and such license is in force at the time of sale,\nbut clause (e) of s. 2 declares that \"retail sale\" means a sale to a consumer for the purposes of consumption and not for resale. Furthermore, s. 4 in the most explicit terms imposes the tax on the consumer in respect of the consumption of the tobacco purchased, and makes it payable at the time the purchaser makes his purchase. It is true that the word \"consumer,\" as defined in s. 2(a), includes, not only a person, who purchases tobacco at a retail sale in the Province for his own consumption or for the consumption of other persons at his expense, but one who purchases the tobacco\non behalf of or as the agent for a principal, who desires to acquire such tobacco for consumption by such principal or other persons at the expense of such principal,\nand that s. 10 provides\nthat a consumer shall be and remain liable for the tax imposed by this Act until the same has been collected.\nSo far, however, as purchases made in the Province are concerned, it is plain that the tax must be paid at the time of the purchase, and that if the tax is not then paid no purchase can lawfully be made, so that s. 10 cannot very well be intended to apply to the purchase of any tobacco within the Province. It is obviously intended to apply to the provisions of s. 5 in any case where a person residing or ordinarily resident or carrying on business in the Province may be found to have brought into the Province or have received delivery in the Province of tobacco purchased outside the Province for his consumption, when he is required to report the fact to the Minister and then to pay the same tax in respect of the consumption of such tobacco as would have been payable if the tobacco had been purchased at a retail sale in the Province at the same price.\nIn any event, as I read the relevant provisions, the tax is imposed upon the consumer in respect of his own consumption of it or the consumption of it by other persons at his expense, whether the tobacco be purchased by him personally or by someone whom he has requested to make the purchase for him, either within or without the Province. It cannot reasonably, in my opinion, be held to be a tax imposed upon any other person than upon the consumer himself in respect of tobacco purchased for his own consumption or consumption by other persons at his expense. It was surely never intended to make a servant or a messenger, who might be sent by his employer to buy a package of tobacco or cigarettes for consumption by his employer or his employer's friends at his employer's expense, liable for the tax so explicitly imposed by the statute in respect of the consumption of the tobacco thus purchased. The fact that the purchase is made for the master and intending consumer by a servant or messenger does not make the purchase any less the purchase of the master, either at law or according to the common understanding of men, than if the master\u2014the intending consumer\u2014went to the retail store to make it personally. No purchase being possible without payment of the tax, there could in the ordinary course of events be but few instances where a master would send a servant or messenger to a retail vendor's shop to buy tobacco for him without giving him the money to pay both the tax and the price of the tobacco. It would only be in a case where the intending consumer at the moment found himself without the necessary money that there would be any likelihood of the messenger himself paying either the tax or the purchase price with any other than the consumer's own money. In such a contingency the master might borrow the necessary money from someone else, or possibly the servant might himself for the time being lend the money to his master, if he had the change in his own pocket. Constructively at least the money paid to the vendor would none the less be the master's. The tax itself would not amount at the most in such a case to more than five or ten cents, for the statute provides for the computation of the tax to the nearest cent (one-half cent being considered as one cent) at the rate of ten per centum of the retail price of the tobacco purchased.\nFor my part I would, like my brother Rinfret, be very loathe to hold that the mere fact of the purchase being made by a servant or by a special messenger under such exceptional circumstances could have the effect of converting what is otherwise so plainly a direct tax upon a consumer in respect of his own consumption of tobacco, and thus within the constitutional power of a Provincial Legislature, into an indirect tax entirely beyond the legislative power of any of the Provinces.\nThe statute intends the payment of but one tax in respect of each separate purchase of tobacco in the Province. This, as I have said, it definitely requires to be paid at the time the purchase is made by or in behalf of the prospective consumer. If the servant or messenger in the circumstances I have indicated, either for his own or for his master's convenience, voluntarily makes the payment for his master with his own money or with money borrowed by him for the purpose, it surely cannot well be said that he thereby becomes the \"consumer\" within the meaning of the charging section of the statute, and that the statute imposes the tax upon him and not upon his master as the prospective consumer. The statute certainly does not compel the servant or agent to pay the tax if the master or employer does not provide him with the money for the purpose, It would in such circumstances be purely a voluntary payment upon his part wholly incompatible with the legal conception of a tax. It seems to me that there would be quite as much reason for saying that if the prospective consumer, not having the money in his pocket at the moment, borrowed it from a servant or from anybody else, went to the vendor's shop himself, made the purchase and paid the tax with the borrowed money, the lender, and not the purchaser, would thereby become the consumer and the taxpayer.\nEven if the alternative provision contained in s. 2 (a) concerning the purchase within the province from a retail vendor by an agent for his principal for consumption by the latter or by other persons at his expense must be construed as constituting the servant or agent, and not the principal, for whom the purchase is made, the intended taxpayer in such circumstances as above suggested, the servant or agent would not surely find it any less practicable or possible to pass on the tax to his master by means of a resale to him, than the master would to pass it on by the same means to anybody else\u2014in the face of the express statutory prohibition against any resale in any manner whatsoever. Perhaps I should in this connection mention s. 7 in addition to the other sections I have referred to. This section, so far as all retail vendors are concerned, precludes as effectually as any statutory provisions can the absorption of the tax in the retail price or its recoupment in whole or in part to the purchaser.\nReading all the material sections together, it is impossible, I think, to conceive how the Legislature could more effectually have indicated its intention that this tax should be demanded from the very persons, who it intended or desired should pay it. This is the essential characteristic of \"direct,\" as distingushed from \"indirect\" taxation, and constitutes the true criterion for determining whether a particular tax falls under the former or the latter category, as expounded by John Stuart Mill in his well known treatise on Political Economy, and adopted by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[45] and in Cotton v. Rex[46], and other cases, and so distinctly reaffirmed by Lord Thankerton in the recent case of Attorney-General for British Columbia v. Kingcome Navigation Co.[47], as to the meaning of the term \"direct taxation\" in s. 92 (2) of the British North America Act. In the face of the various provisions of the statute itself, how can it logically be said that the tax imposed by the impugned statute is a tax which the Legislature intended should be borne by any other person than the prospective consumer himself, or that it is a tax, the general tendency of which is to enhance or in any way affect the retail price of tobacco either within or without the Province? The definite provisions of the statute itself in my judgment make the question as to the general tendency of the tax quite irrelevant, unless indeed one is disposed to question the good faith of the Legislature and regard the whole scheme of the statute as a mere pretence or colourable arrangement in order to disguise what is claimed to be \"indirect taxation,\" which is not within its legislative powers, as \"direct taxation,\" which is. For my part I am not disposed to do so.\nWith all respect, the only ground to my mind upon which any argument could possibly be based in support of the contention that the tax imposed by the Act is not a direct tax within the competency of the Provinces under the provisions of s. 92 (2) of the British North America Act is that of the inclusion of the alternative provision regarding purchases by agents in the definition of \"consumer\" in s. 2 (2) of the impugned statute. The most that can be said as to this is that the language of the alternative clause may be confusing. Seeing that no retail purchase could lawfully be made within the Province without the tax being immediately paid, this clause would appear to have no perceivable object and to be quite unnecessary to the levying of the intended tax. For this reason the draftsman would have been well advised, in my opinion, to omit it. It could be deleted at any time without affecting the vital object of the Act.\nAs to s. 5, it is directed only against persons ordinarily resident or carrying on business in New Brunswick, who might otherwise seek to avail themselves of favourable opportunities to buy their tobacco outside the Province and thereby easily evade the tax, which s. 4 so plainly intends to apply to all consumers alike in the Province. Its only and perfectly obvious purpose is to close such an inviting opening to such persons as might be inclined to dodge the intended tax by such convenient means. The section merely places such persons on the same footing in respect of their consumption of tobacco purchased by or for them outside the Province as all \"consumers,\" who buy their tobacco within the Province. It does not purport in any sense to prohibit any one from buying tobacco outside the Province, but makes it clear that when one does so and brings it into the Province or receives delivery of it in the Province for his own consumption he does not thereby free himself of liability to pay the same tax in respect of its consumption as if he had bought it at a retail store within the Province at the same price. Surely if the charging section of the statute is itself within the legislative competency of the Province, such a purely subsidiary section\u2014having no other perceivable object than the prevention or the evasion or defeat of the intended tax\u2014cannot well be held to be beyond it.\nAs to the contention that the intended tax is in reality a customs or excise duty and consequently an \"indirect tax,\" and that its attempted imposition therefore infringes the exclusive legislative jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament in relation to the creation or alteration of such duties, as expressly conferred by s. 122 of the B.N.A. Act, precisely the same objection was made in the Kingcome case[48] regarding the imposition of the fuel oil tax by the British Columbia Fuel Oil Tax Act, 1930, c. 71, as amended by the statute of 1932, c. 51, upon every consumer of fuel oil according to the quantity which he has consumed. The Judicial Committee overruled the objection as inconsistent with its own decisions, \"which,\"\u2014to quote the language of Lord Thankerton\u2014\ngo back to the year 1878, and settled that the test to foe applied in determining what is \"direct taxation,\" within the meaning of s. 92, head 2, of the Act of 1867 is to be found in Mill's definition of direct and indirect taxes.\nThat is surely conclusive as to this ground of appeal.\nIt is argued as well that s. 5 of the New Brunswick statute contravenes s. 121 of the B.N.A. Act, as interposing an obstacle to the free admission of tobacco as an article\nof the growth, produce or manufacture of any one of the Provinces into each of the other Provinces,\nwithin the meaning of that enactment.\nThis section came before this Court for interpretation for the first time in 1921, in the case of Gold Seal Ltd. v. Attorney-General for Alberta[49], on the question of the constitutional validity of an enactment of the Parliament of Canada contained in ch. 8, 10 Geo. V, 1919, prohibiting the importation of intoxicating liquor into those Provinces, where its sale for beverage purposes is forbidden by provincial law. The case was heard by Sir Louis Davies, C.J., and Idington, Duff, Anglin and Mignault, JJ. Duff, J., dealing with the construction of s. 181, held that the phraseology adopted, when the context is considered in which the section is found, shows that the real object of the clause is to prohibit the establishment of customs duties affecting interprovincial trade in the products of any Province of the Union.\nAnglin, J., expressed the view that the impugned legislation was not obnoxious to s. 121 of the B.N.A. Act.\nThe purpose,\nhe said,\nof that section is to insure that articles of the growth, produce or manufacture of any Province shall not be subjected to any customs duty when carried into any other Province. Prohibition of import in aid of temperance legislation is not within the purview of the section.\nMignault, J., thought that\nthe object of s. 121 was not to decree that all articles of the growth, produce or manufacture of any of the Provinces should be admitted into the others, bnt merely to secure that they should be admitted \"free,\" that is to say, without any tax or duty imposed as a condition of their admission.\nThe essential word here,\nhe continued,\nis \"free,\" and what is prohibited is the levying of customs duties or other charges of a like nature in matters of interprovincial trade.\nThe clear effect of these three several pronouncements as read together, it seems to me, is that the words \"admitted free,\" as used in s. 121, mean admitted free of customs duties, and for that reason, and that reason only, even an express prohibition of the import of intoxicating liquor from one province to another in aid of provincial temperance legislation is not within the purview of the section. That is precisely how the head-note of the case states the decision of the court on the construction of the section relied on as invalidating the legislation there in question. Whether or not that decision means that the section only applies to Dominion legislation, it plainly implies, I most respectfully think, that the Parliament of Canada may validly go so far as to expressly prohibit the admission from one Province to another of any article of the growth, produce or manufacture of another Province, so long as the prohibition does not involve the imposition of a customs duty. If that be so in respect of the application of the section to Dominion legislation, how can this Court now consistently hold that a provincial enactment, which neither prohibits nor in any sense obstructs nor restrains, as between vendor and purchaser, the passage of any such article from one Province to another, does fall within the purview of the intended ban? No one contends or could well contend that intoxicating liquor is not quite as much an article of the growth, produce or manufacture of one or more of the Provinces of Oanada as tobacco. Surely s. 121 of our Constitutional Act was never intended to have one meaning in its application to Dominion legislation and quite another meaning in its application to provincial legislation. And for my part I cannot see how the fact that in the Gold Seal case[50] the court was considering an enactment of the Parliament of Canada in relation to the importation of intoxicating liquor from one Province to another can justify us in completely discarding the construction so explicitly placed on s. 121 of the B.N.A. Act in that case, and now construing the words \"admitted free,\" as used therein, in such a sweeping sense as that contended for in support of this appeal.\nIf we were being called upon to interpret the section for the first time, and if I may say so with all respect, I should be disposed to regard it in precisely the same light as Mignault, J., so clearly expounded it in the passage I have quoted, and to hold that it was inserted in the Imperial Act\nmerely to secure that they (articles of the growth, produce or manufacture of any of the Provinces) should be admitted \"free\" (in each of the other Provinces), that is to say, without any tax or duty imposed as a condition of their admission,\nand that\nwhat is prohibited is the levying of customs duties or other charges of a like nature in matters of interprovincial trade.\nThis treats the section as applicable to Dominion and provincial legislation alike, and in no way concerns the distributon of legislative powers as between the Dominion and the Provinces. It recognizes on the one hand the exclusive power of the Dominion to create and impose both customs and excise duties, and on the other the exclusive right of the Provinces to impose direct taxation within the Province for the purpose of raising revenue for provincial purposes, so long as the imposition of such duties or taxes by either authority does not constitute an obstacle to the admission of articles grown, produced or manufactured in any one or more of the Provinces into any other Province in the sense of imposing any condition to such admission. For the reasons already stated, I cannot see how the New Brunswick Tobacco Tax Act imposes any condition whatever to the importation or admission into that Province of tobacco, whether it be the produce of any other Province of Canada or of any foreign country.\nThe tax or charge contemplated by s. 5 is a tax or charge which, I repeat, is not payable until after the tobacco has been brought into the Province by the prospective consumer or received by him within the Province for consumption by himself or others at his expense. Indeed the tax is neither leviable nor in any manner recoverable until after the intending consumer has reported to the Provincial Secretary-Treasurer the fact that he has brought the tobacco into the Province or received delivery of it within the Province for that purpose, and the price paid for it to the outside vendor.\nThe objection that the statute's requirements regarding vendors' licenses are ultra vires of the Legislature as not falling within the purview of s. 92 (9) of the B.N.A. Act, is equally untenable for the reasons so convincingly stated by my brother Rinfret.\nI agree with him that the appeal should be dismissed with costs against the appellant, but with no costs to the intervenant, the Attorney-General of the Province of Quebec.\nKerwin J.\u2014Speaking generally, the tax in question is, in my opinion, a direct tax for the raising of a revenue for provincial purposes within the meaning of head 2 of section 92 of the British North America Act. The mere insertion, by the legislature, of the phrase in section 4 of the Act \"a tax in respect of the consumption of such tobacco\" is not conclusive but upon consideration it appears to me that the tax is imposed upon the very person it is intended should bear it and who, in the ordinary course, will not be able to pass it on. The \"consumer\" of tobacco purchasing it at a retail sale in the Province is ordered to pay the tax at the time of purchase, and the vendor is made the collecting agency for the Province. In my view the tax is not imposed on one of the parties to a sale of tobacco in respect of that transaction, and the fact that it is imposed before consumption (instead of after consumption as in the Kingcome case[51]) is not of importance if my conclusion as to the true nature and tendency of the tax is correct.\nIn two respects the statute is partially ultra vires. The attempt by that part of the definition of \"consumer\" or \"consumer of tobacco\" to impose the tax on an agent must, I think, fail as being indirect taxation. However, the principal is liable for the tax and the part relating to the agent is clearly severable.\nSection 5, which is also severable, is ultra vires because it infringes the provisions of section 121 of the British North America Act. The statute before this Court in the Gold Seal case[52] was a Dominion enactment and there is nothing in any of the judgments inconsistent with this conclusion. It is true that the person who brings into New Brunswick tobacco for his own consumption reports the matter to the Minister but the fact that the entry into the Province may, or always will, precede the reporting and payment of the tax, makes it none the less an impost upon the production or manufacture of another province if the tobacco in question falls within that class. If, of course, the tobacco is brought from a foreign country, the tax directed to be paid by section 5 is a customs duty and beyond the powers of a provincial legislature. The main purpose of the statute is to impose direct taxation within the Province but it is not ancillary to that purpose to attempt to regulate external trade in a particular commodity or to impose a customs duty thereon. A provincial legislature is not authorized thus to seize a power that was expressly withheld from it.\nWith the two exceptions mentioned, the statute is intra vires and as the repugnant provisions are severable, the plaintiff appellant, which carries on the business of selling tobacco in New Brunswick, is unable to succeed in its action which by the judgment a quo stands dismissed. The appeal should be dismissed but there should be no costs. Hudson J.\u2014I have had an opportunity of reading the judgment prepared by my brother Rinfret and agree with the conclusions at which he has arrived, except on one point, that is, the personal liability imposed on an agent. This, I think, oversteps the limits of Provincial legislative jurisdiction but, with this qualification, I would dismiss the appeal.\nTaschereau J.\u2014The Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division, held that the Tobacco Tax Act and regulations thereunder are constitutional. The Atlantic Smoke Shops Limited now appeals to this Court, and the Attorney-General for the province of Quebec (where a law substantially similar has been enacted) having been allowed to intervene, joins with the Attorney-General for New Brunswick, and submits that the Act is intra vires of the province.\nThe Act which was enacted on the 11th of May, 1940, came into force on the first day of October of the same year by Proclamation of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council.\nThe appellant has a retail store in the city of Saint John and carries on the business of selling tobacco, including cigars and cigarettes, and has refused to obtain the license required by the Act. It has also neglected to collect the tax imposed upon every purchaser.\nThe appellant submits that this tax is not a direct tax, nor a tax within the province; that the Act infringes upon the executive legislative jurisdiction of the Dominion to impose customs and excise duties, and that the license provided for is not within the category of licenses for which, under section 92, subsection 9, of the British North America Act, the provinces have legislative powers.\nThe principal sections of the Act which have to be considered are the following:\u2014\nSection 4, which is the taxing section, reads:\u2014\nEvery consumer of tobacco purchased at a retail sale in the province shall pay to His Majesty the King in the right of the province for the raising of a revenue, at the time of making his purchase, a tax in respect of the consumption of such tobacco, and such tax shall be computed at the rate of ten per centum of the retail price of the tobacco purchased. The word \"consumer\" is defined as follows:\u2014\n2. In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires (a) \"Consumer\" or \"Consumer of Tobacco\" means any person who within the Province, purchases from a vendor tobacco at a retail sale in the Province for his own consumption or for the consumption of other persons at his expense or who, within the Province, purchases from a vendor tobacco at a retail sale in the Province on behalf of or as agent for a principal who desires to acquire such tobacco for consumption by such principal or other persons at the expense of such principal.\nThe Act further provides that the purchaser must purchase from a retail vendor who must obtain a license issued from the proper authorities; and a retail sale is defined as being a \"sale to a consumer for purposes of consumption and not for sale.\" Every licensed retail vendor is constituted an agent of the Minister for the collection of the tax, and he must collect it from the purchaser upon whom the tax is imposed, at the time the purchase is made within the Province.\nThe provinces draw their powers to impose direct taxation from section 92, subsection 2 of the Brush North America Act, and in order to determine whether this particular tax is direct or indirect, the rule many times adopted by this Court and by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council has once more to be applied.\nIn City of Charlottetown v. Foundation Maritime Limited[53] Mr. Justice Rinfret, delivering the judgment of the Court, analyzed the various pronouncements on this matter and said:\u2014\nAt the time of the passing of the Act,\u2014and before,\u2014the classification of the then existing species of taxes into these two separate and distinct categories was familiar to statesmen. Certain taxes were then universally recognized as falling within one or the other category. The framers of the Act should not be taken to have intended to disturb \"the established classification of the old and well known species of taxation.\" (City of Halifax v. Fairbanks' Estate[54]).\nCustoms or excise duties were the classical type of indirect taxes. Taxes on property or income were commonly regarded as direct taxes.\nThese taxes had come to be placed respectively in the category of direct or indirect taxes according to some tangible dividing line referable to and ascertainable by their general tendencies. (Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[55]).\nAs to the taxes outside these classifications\nthe meaning of the words \"direct taxation\" as used in the Act, is to be gathered from the common understanding of these words which pre- vailed among the economists who had treated such subjects before the Act was passed.\nIt is now settled that the tax is direct, if it is demanded from the very person who it is intended or desired shall pay it, and it is indirect, if it is demanded from one person in the expectation and intention that he shall indemnify himself at the expense of another.\nIt is also the general tendency of the legislation that has to be considered, although in exceptional cases the person made liable by the law to pay the tax may succeed in passing it on, and indemnify himself upon a resale of the commodity. (Attorney-General for British Columbia v. Canadian Pacific Railway[56]; Rex. v. Caledonian Collieries Limited[57]). When the ultimate incidence of the tax, in its ordinary and normal operation, is uncertain, then the tax is indirect, because the question whether the tax is direct or not cannot depend upon those special events which may vary at the time of payment. (Attorney-General for Quebec v. Read[58]; Attorney-General for British Columbia v. Kingcome[59]).\nIn the case submitted to this Court, (I will deal later with the clause making the agent personally liable) the tax is clearly imposed upon the purchaser of tobacco, who is the last purchaser. It is a purchasing tax, not imposed on the transaction of the commodity, but upon every purchaser at the time of making his purchase at a retail sale in the Province. This purchaser is the person intended by the Legislature to pay the tax, and he does pay it at the time of the purchase. Under section 10 of the Act, he is made liable for the tax imposed until it has been collected. There is no expectation or intention that this purchaser from whom the tax is demanded shall pass it on and indemnify himself, and that someone else than the person primarily taxed will pay it eventually.\nThe appellant has cited the case of the Attorney-General for British Columbia v. Canadian Pacific Railway56, where it was decided that a tax imposed upon every person purchasing fuel oil within the Province for the first time after its manufacture, was an indirect tax, and therefore ultra vires. The Judicial Committee came to the conclusion that fuel oil is a marketable commodity, and that those who purchase it for the first time after its manufacture, even for their own use, acquire the right to take it into the market and indemnify themselves at the expense of others. This, therefore, brought the tax within the principles which made it an indirect tax.\nIn the present case, it is the last purchaser who is taxed and it is, therefore, quite impossible that the tax can be passed on. In the case already cited of the Attorney-General for British Columbia v. Kingcome[60], the Judicial Committee upheld the validity of the second fuel oil tax enacted by the province of British Columbia. The Legislature imposed a tax upon every consumer of fuel oil according to the quantity consumed. It was held that the tax was direct taxation, because it was demanded from the very person who it is intended or desired should pay it. As the tax does not relate to any commercial dealing with the commodity, it does not fall within the category of customs and excise duties which are within the legislative powers of the Dominion.\nIn that case, Lord Thankerton expresses himself as follows:\u2014\nIt is clear that the Act (fuel act) purports to exact the tax from a person who has consumed fuel oil, the amount of the tax being computed broadly according to the amount consumed. The Act does not relate to any commercial transaction in the commodity between the taxpayer and someone else. Their Lordships are unable to find, on examination of the Act, any justification for the suggestion that the tax is truly imposed in respect of the transaction by which the taxpayer acquires the property in the fuel oil nor in respect of any contract or arrangements under which the oil is consumed, though it is of course possible that individual taxpayers may recoup themselves by such a contract or arrangement; but this cannot affect the nature of the tax. Accordingly, their Lordships are of opinion that the tax is direct taxation within the meaning of section 92, head 2, of the British North America Act.\nI have no doubt that this tax is a direct one, and, therefore, within the powers of the Legislature of New Brunswick.\nThe next point raised is that the tax is not a tax within the Province. The argument is that the Legislature is attempting to tax a non-resident of the province of New Brunswick with respect to his consumption of tobacco outside the Province. The Act provides that the tax is levied only when the purchaser purchases in the Province. It is undoubted that it is within the powers of the Legislature to tax any person found in the Province, whether that person is therein domiciled or not, if taxed directly. Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[61]; Forbes v. Attorney-General for Manitoba[62]).\nThe purchaser pays the tax at the time and place he purchases the commodity. Although this tax has been called a consumption tax, it is more a purchasing tax which is paid by the last purchaser who is deemed to be the consumer. As section 2 (a) of the Act says, \"consumer\" means any person who within the Province purchases * * * for his own consumption. As the purchase is made within the Province, it seems clear that the taxation is imposed within the Province, even if by exception the tobacco purchased is consumed in a different Province. It is only in exceptional cases resulting from the act of the purchaser that the tobacco may be consumed outside the Province.\nThe appellant has also raised the contention that this tax is ultra vires because it violates the disposition of section 121 of the B.N.A. Act, which says:\u2014\n121. All articles of the growth, produce, or manufacture of any one of the provinces shall, from and after the Union, be admitted free into each of the other provinces.\nThe argument of the appellant is that the Act purports to impose a tax upon articles produced or manufactured in another province of Canada when introduced into New Brunswick. In the submission of the appellant the objectionable clause of the Act is section 5, which reads as follows:\u2014\n5. Every person residing or ordinarily resident or carrying on business in New Brunswick, who brings into the Province or who receives delivery in the Province of tobacco for his own consumption or for the consumption of other persons at his expense or on behalf of or as agent for a principal who desires to acquire such tobacco for consumption by such principal or other persons at his expense shall immediately report the matter to the Minister and forward or produce to him the invoice, if any, in respect of such tobacco and any other information required by the Minister with respect to the tobacco and shall pay the same tax in respect of the consumption of such tobacco as would have been payable if the tobacco had been purchased at a retail sale in the Province at the same price.\nThis tax, in my opinion, is not a customs duty nor an excise tax. In Attorney-General for British Columbia v. Kingcome[63], Lord Thankerton said:\u2014 Customs and Excise duties are in their essence, trading taxes and may be said to be more concerned with the commodity in respect of which the taxation is imposed than with the particular person from whom the tax is exacted.\nIn the case of Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[64], Lord Hobhouse expressed himself in the following manner:\u2014\nIt is not like a customs duty which enters into the price of the taxed commodity.\nThese customs duties impose a condition on the admission of the commodity before reaching the consumer, and as Mr. Justice Mignault says in Gold Seal Limited v. Dominion Express Company[65]:\u2014\nI think that, like the enactment I have just quoted, the object of section 121 was not to decree that all articles of the growth, produce or manufacture of any of the provinces should be admitted into the others, but merely to secure that they should be admitted \"free,\" that is to say without any tax or duty imposed as a condition of their admission. The essential word here is \"free\" and what is prohibited is the levying of customs duties or other charges of a like nature in matters of inter-provincial trade.\nThe tax contemplated by the Tobacco Act is imposed only once the importation is made, and such importation in the province of New Brunswick does not depend upon the payment of the tax. If we were to adopt the construction suggested by the appellant, no purchaser of a commodity coming from a different province could ever be taxed. When the commodity has entered into the Province, I see no valid reason why the purchaser could not be compelled to pay a tax to the provincial authorities.\nIt has also been submitted that the retail vendors are subject to the payment of a licence and that the licensing provisions found in the Act are not authorized by the Brush North America Act. I fail to see how the appellant can succeed on this ground. The licenses provided for in section 92, subsection 9, of the British North America Act are not the only licenses in relation to which the various provinces may enact laws. They may provide for licenses not only for the purpose of raising a revenue, but they have also the right to require licenses as an incident to any one of their other powers.\nThe appellant has submitted also that the Tobacco Act purports to tax not only the principal but also the agent who, on behalf of his principal, purchases tobacco.

Booker (41 Can. S.C.R. 331; Q.R. 17 K.B. 193) foll.\nAPPEALS from two judgments of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, reversing the judgments of the Superior Court, Boulanger J. and maintaining the respondents' seizures in revendication of moveable property sold at a bailiff's sale.\nThe material facts of the cases and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nGustave Monette K.C., L. Dussault K.C. and D. Goulet for the appellants.\nLouis Morin K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014These two cases were heard together, on the same evidence, both in the Superior Court and in the Court of King's Bench (appeal side). They were submitted to this Court on the same argument; and the reasons for judgment apply to both.\nThe question is whether the owner of moveable property may revendicate it against the adjudicataire at a bailiff's sale, when the seizure has taken place super non domino et non possidente. In the Superior Court, it was held that the seizure in revendication was not open to the owner; but, in the Court of King's Bench, the majority of the judges held otherwise and maintained the seizure in revendication.\nThe plaintiffs-respondents, Nicholson and Cates, lumber merchants of Toronto, alleged that they were owners of lumber at Kanasuta, in Northern Quebec, and that their lumber was sold in execution of a judgment obtained by the Quebec Workmen's Compensation Commission against James Charron and H. M. Charron, who had neither the property nor the possession of the lumber; that the sale was fraudulent; that all its proceedings were irregular, illegal and entirely null and void; and they asked that the sale be annulled and set aside; that they be declared the owners of the lumber and that the seizure in revendication thereof, which accompanied the action, be maintained.\nUnder the same circumstances and for the same reasons The Royal Bank of Canada claimed possession against the adjudicataires of certain machinery seized in the mill at Kanasuta in execution of the same judgment obtained by the Quebec Workmen's Compensation Commission.\nThe writ of execution de bonis, on the authority of which the moveable property in question was seized, issued from the Superior Court, in the city of Quebec, in favour of the Quebec Workmen's Compensation Commission against James Charron and H. M. Charron, who are described in the writ as\nformerly doing business under the name and style of North Western Lumber Company and having a place of business at Kanasuta, Temiskaming, logging and shipping operations, Kanasuta, Temiskaming, P.Q.\nThe command contained in the writ was\nde pr\u00e9lever des biens mobiliers des dits employeurs (i.e., James Charron and H. M. Charron) dans votre district la somme de $527.35 courant, \u00e9tant le montant de la dite dette, p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s et des d\u00e9pens pour lesquels la requ\u00e9rante est autoris\u00e9e a ex\u00e9cuter comme susdit.\nIn 1937, the Charrons organized a limited company under the name of The North Western Timber Company Limited. This new organization, on the 26th of April, 1938, leased a mill from the respondent, The Royal Bank of Canada. The machinery now revendicated by the bank was included in that lease.\nIn 1939, the new company entered into a contract to sell to the respondents, Nicholson and Gates, 500,000 feet of sawn wood. The lumber was sawn and put in piles. The respondents Nicholson & Cates fulfilled all their obligations to the letter; and, in April, 1939, the operations under the contract were completed and the lumber was ready for shipment. The Court of King's Bench, found that it was clearly established that the bank was the owner of the mill equipment; and the lease, already referred to, was made by the bank to the North Western Timber Company Limited.\nThe Court of King's Bench also found it to have been clearly established that the lumber seized in this case was cut by the North Western Timber Company, from logs belonging to it, for the respondents Nicholson and Cates, under a contract dating back to the 13th January, 1939, and that it had been delivered to the latter and paid for by them to the North Western Timber Company Limited prior to the bailiff's sale, which took place on the 25th of April, 1939.\nAs a matter of fact, it appears to us that the Court could have gone further and found, on the evidence, that the delivery had taken place prior to the seizure itself made by the plaintiff.\nThere can be no doubt that, at the time of the seizure, both respondents were respectively the owners of the moveable property which they revendicate and that such moveable property was in the legal possession of the respondents, while in the physical possession of the North Western Timber Company Limited.\nThe trial revealed that, after 1937, the Charrons, or their partnership, known under the name and style of the North Western Lumber Company, had not done any business at that place and, moreover, that they never had a mill in the province of Quebec.\nThe writ of execution itself, as already pointed out, described them as\nformerly doing business together under the name and style of North Western Lumber Company.\nIn 1939, and more particularly at the time of the seizure, the North Western Timber Company Limited was alone doing business. It had rented the mill from the bank, and it was that company which had entered into the contract with the respondents Nicholson and Cates, the Charron partnership firm having no interest therein.\nIt would appear that these facts were well known to the local people, and, in particular to the bailiff, M. St-Germain, and to the appellant H\u00e9roux, who was the postmaster in the locality. At the bailiff's sale, the mill equipment belonging to the bank, the value of which approximately was $5,000, was adjudicated to the respondent H\u00e9roux for the insignificant sum of $70; and the lumber belonging to Nicholson and Cates, the value of which was approximately $9,000, was adjudicated to the appellant St.-Germain (brother of the bailiff) for the likewise insignificant sum of $200.\nThe judgment of the Superior Court, after having found that the essential formalities necessary for the validity of the seizure and sale appeared to have been complied with, and that there was no evidence of any collusion between the adjudicataires and the bailiff, and that there was equally no evidence of fraud, bad faith, or irregular dealings on their part, held that, the adjudicataires having paid the price in the regular way and having thereby become full and complete owners of the moveable property adjudged to them at the judicial sale, and the proceeds of the sale having been regularly remitted by the bailiff to the parties entitled to them, the adjudicataires were protected by article 668 of the Code of Civil Procedure by force of which\nWithout prejudice to the recourse of the party aggrieved against the seizing creditor and those acting on his behalf, no demand to annul or rescind a sale of moveable property under execution can be received against a purchaser who has paid the price, saving the case of fraud or collusion.\nThe Superior Court admitted that the judicial sale could have been set aside if it had been established that no valid and regular seizure and sale had taken place; but it found that these conditions had not been established in the present case.\nThe majority of the Court of King's Bench, on appeal, accepted the proposition of law that\nthe provisions of article 668, C.P., are predicated upon the assumption that the seizure itself was valid;\nbut it held that, in the premises, the seizure was absolutely null, because\nin virtue of article 613 C.C.P. a creditor may seize in execution the moveable property of his debtor in such debtor's possession and, therefore, the mandate of a bailiff in charge of a writ of execution does not extend to the seizure of any moveables of which the debtor is neither the owner nor in possession.\nThe Court further stated that the jurisprudence of the province of Quebec has repeatedly confirmed the rule that the seizure and the sale of property made super non domino et non possidente are absolutely null; and it referred to its own decision in Brook v. Booker[1].\nIt may be well to note at the outset that this is a case of the judicial seizure and sale of moveable property and that anything said in connection therewith may not be taken as necessarily applying to a judicial seizure and sale of immoveable property.\nArticle 613 C.C.P. on which the judgment appealed from is based reads as follows:\n613. A creditor may seize in execution the moveable or the immoveable property of his debtor, in such debtor's possession, as well as any corporeal moveables in the possession of the creditors or of third parties who consent thereto.\nFor the purpose of this case, it is sufficient to note that, under that article of the Code, the creditor may seize in execution the moveable property of his debtor which is \"in such debtor's possession.\" The remainder of the article may be disregarded here.\nThus the moveable property which may be seized in execution by a creditor must be the property of his debtor, and it must be in his debtor's possession. Such is the requirement of the Code; and the writ of seizure issued by the court in favour of the Quebec Workmen's Compensation Commission against the Charrons specifically orders \"de pr\u00e9lever des biens mobiliers des dits employeurs\" (that is to say: of the Charrons) the charges and the costs mentioned in the writ.\nHowever, it is not to be denied, notwithstanding the clear wording of article 613 C.C.P., that it must be read in conjunction with other articles of the same Code and also with the articles of the Civil Code which may be found to have a bearing upon the subject. Of course, counsel for the appellants relied on this obvious argument and pointed to article 668 C.C.P., above reproduced, and also to article 665 C.C.P.:\n665. The adjudication of moveable property under execution transfers by law the ownership of the things thus adjudged.\nand then to article 2268 C.C. reading in part as follows:\nIf the thing has been sold under the authority of law, it cannot, in any case, be revendicated. It is contended that, by force of these several articles, the moveable things, though belonging to the respondents, may no longer be revendicated, because they were purchased by the appellants at a sale made \"under the authority of law\" and that\nno demand to annul or rescind a sale of moveable property under execution can be received against a purchaser who has paid the price, saving the case of fraud or collusion;\nand they point to the fact that no fraud or collusion has here been found.\nThe respondents, however, argue that, in order to allow articles 665 and 668 of the Code of Civil Procedure and article 2268 of the Civil Code to have their full play, there must have been a lawful seizure and judicial sale of moveable property, and that such is the only proper meaning to be attributed to these articles. That interpretation is clearly in accordance with ordinary principles of construction.\nIndeed, in Brook v. Booker[2], as late as 1907, a sale by a bailiff pretending to act under a writ of execution of moveable things of which no lawful seizure had been made was held not to be \"a sale of moveable property under execution,\" within the meaning of art. 668 C.C.P.; and an action to annul or rescind it was held, therefore, to lie against the adjudicataire who had paid the price. That judgment was confirmed in this Court[3] and Sir Charles Fitzpatrick, the then Chief Justice, delivering the judgment (with which all the other judges concurred), referred to the several articles of the Code above mentioned and said:\nI appreciate the importance of giving effect to the maxim \"En fait de meubles, possession vaut titre\" (article 2268 C.C.) and of maintaining the validity of a judicial sale; and I freely concede that irregularities of procedure should not invalidate the title of a purchaser in good faith of moveables at a judicial sale (art. 668 C.C.P.). But there is another principle of at least equal importance which is a necessary part of the judicial system of every British country, to this effect, that no man shall be deprived of his property except by consequence of the law of the land. The general principle of law is (art. 1487 C.C.) that the sale of a thing which does not belong to the seller is null. By way of exception to this general rule arts. 1490 and 2268 C.C. provide, in effect, that corporeal moveables sold under authority of law cannot be reclaimed. The commentators on the articles in the Code Napoleon, which correspond with the articles of the Quebec Civil Code\u2014there being no article in the French Code which corresponds with art. 668 C.C.P.\u2014say that this exception to the general rule is based upon the maxim en fait de meubles, possession vaut titre.\nAnd the learned Chief Justice referred to Planiol, vol. I, nos 1119 and 1124; and, pointing to the fact that, in the Brook case (1), there was no legal seizure, he added:\nConsequently no \"sale under execution\" (art. 668 C.C.P.) or \"under authority of law\" (arts. 1490 and 2268 C.C.) ever took place.\nThis Court held, accordingly, that there having been no valid seizure under the writ of execution, the adjudicataire had acquired no title to the property and the sale to him should be rescinded.\nBrook v. Booker[4] is, therefore, an authority binding on this Court to the effect that, in order to justify the application of arts. 665 and 668 of the Code of Civil Procedure and of art. 2268 of the Civil Code, there must have been a lawful seizure and sale, in which case only can it be said that \"the thing has been sold under the authority of law.\"\nIn our view, this point does not require to be further elaborated. Interpreting the law in the light of Brook v. Booker4 and of the jurisprudence in the province of Quebec, it must be held that the adjudicataire cannot hold moveable property, even if acquired through execution by a bailiff, if such moveable property was seized super non possidente.\nIt may be that art. 668 C.C.P. goes the length of declaring that moveable property seized in the possession of the judgment debtor, although he be not the owner, may not be revendicated by the true owner, after the judicial sale has taken place, against a purchaser who has paid the price (always saving the case of fraud or collusion). Such a consequence may result from the fact that the judgment debtor was found in possession of the moveable property at the time of the seizure and that, by force of art. 2268 C.C., \"en fait de meubles possession vaut titre\"; that is to say, in the wording of the article:\nActual possession of a corporeal moveable, by a person as proprietor, creates a presumption of lawful title.\nThis may be left for decision when a case of such a nature is before the Court. But we can find nowhere, either in the doctrine or the jurisprudence, that judicial seizure and sale of moveable property not in the possession of a judgment debtor will deprive the true owner of his title and will confer on the adjudicataire a title which cannot be defeated and which he may oppose to the revendication of the true owner.\nIn this case, the true owners, The Royal Bank of Canada (of the machinery) and Nicholson and Cates (of the lumber seized and sold), were entitled to revendicate their property which was not found in the possession of the Charrons, of whom the bailiff was warned by the writ of execution itself that they formerly were doing business in partnership under the name of North Western Lumber Company. There was no lawful execution and adjudication of that moveable property within the meaning of arts. 665 and 668 C.C.P., because the property was not seized in the judgment debtor's possession; but, on the contrary, it was in the physical possession of the North Western Timber Company Limited and, in fact, in the legal possession of the respondents themselves. There was no sale \"under the authority of law\" such as to give effect to art. 668 C.C.P. and to art, 2268 C.C., and the appellant adjudicataires cannot, for those reasons, prevent the revendication of the true owners, the respondents.\nWe do not find it necessary to discuss any of the other points of irregularity, for the fact that the seizure was executed super non possidente is sufficient to declare the judicial sale, in the premises, absolutely null and void, in accordance with the pronouncement of the judgment a quo.\nThe appeal in each case should, therefore, be dismissed with costs.\nAppeals dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Donat Goulet and L\u00e9on Dussault.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Morin & Morin.\n[1] (1907) Q.R. 17 K.B. 193.\n[2] (1907) Q.R. 17 K.B. 193.\n[3] (1908) 41 Can.

Plans and specifications, prepared by the engineers of the Department of Public Works, were furnished to the tenderers; and a specific clause therein provided that the contractor would \"be required to sign a contract similar to the form exhibited at the same time as the plans and specifications.\" The respondent's tender for $365,750.18, being the lowest, was accepted by Order in Council passed on the 10th of February, 1937; and, on the 23rd day following, a contract was entered between the Crown and the respondent embodying the terms and conditions under which the works would be performed. The major item of the contract was the furnishing and driving into the soil of a number of steel piles of interlocking type. The respondent performed the entire work. In May, 1938, the respondent claimed by petition of right from the appellant a further sum of $160,000 for damages and additional compensation. The claim was based on the ground that the unit price tendered by the respondent would have been sufficient to cover the work, leaving a reasonable profit, if the soil into which the piles had to be driven had been as described in the plans and specifications, which were declared to be part of the contract; but the respondent alleged that it encountered a certain material called \"hard pan\" and many large boulders therein embedded, thus necessitating extra work and putting the respondent to very large additional expenses. The respondent's claim was, as alleged, for compensation for work not foreseen in the agreement and performed \"hors du contrat,\" under an implied contract, i.e., for works accepted by the Crown for which no compensation has been paid, on a \"quantum meruit\" basis. The Exchequer Court of Canada maintained the respondent's petition of right, holding that the latter was entitled to a sum of $119,597.22; but deducted one-third of that amount owing to loss of time, delay and incompetence attributable to the respondent. Both parties appealed to this Court, the Crown to have the claim dismissed and the respondent to have the amount awarded in the Court below increased.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, that, in view of the terms of the contract, which is the law of the parties and by which this Court is bound, the respondent's petition of right should be dismissed. The respondent tendered to furnish and drive the piles in a soil the nature of which it agreed to investigate, and which the appellant did not guarantee, but merely indicated with some reserves as being of a certain kind or nature. The works to be performed by the respondent were fully covered by the contract and the obligation of the respondent was not to drive piles in a specified soil, but in a specified place. The risk was upon the respondent, and having assumed it, it must necessarily bear all the consequences, financial and others, if it misjudged the works to be performed and miscalculated the cost of the enterprise. Expenses incurred for unforeseen difficulties must be considered as being included in the amount of the tender, and the respondent had the legal obligation to execute the contract for the price agreed upon, in the same way as would have been its undisputable right to benefit, if the soil had been more favourable and easier than foreseen.\nHeld, further, that the: contentions of the Crown could also be upheld upon statutory law: the Exchequer Court of Canada, under section 18 of the Exchequer Court Act, has exclusive original jurisdiction in all cases in which the claim arises out of a contract entered into by or on behalf of the Crown; and section 48 of that Act limits the jurisdiction of that Court and does not allow it to grant any additional compensation.\nHeld, further, that, assuming that the claim of the respondent was not covered by the contract, it would still fail; for then it would have to be founded on an implied contract; and the agreement itself contains a clear declaration of the parties that \"no implied contract of any kind whatsoever, by or on behalf of His Majesty, shall arise or be implied from anything in this contract contained.\"\nDecision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in The King v. Vancouver Lumber Co. (50 D.L.R. 6) has no application to this case, inasmuch as a form of contract, similar to the one subsequently signed by the respondent, had been annexed to the plans and specifications.\nAPPEAL and CROSS-APPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, maintaining the respondent's petition of right and awarding a sum of $79,731.48.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nLs. St-Laurent K.C., Valmore Bienvenue K.C. and Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Car on K.C. for the appellant.\nThomas Vien K.C. and L\u00e9on Faribault K.C. for the respondent. The judgment of the Court was delivered by\nTaschereau J.\u2014In 1936, the Minister of Public Works acting on behalf of His Majesty the King, asked for tenders for the construction of a wharf at Rimouski, in the province of Quebec. Plans and specifications prepared by the engineers of the Department were furnished to the tenderers, and by Order in Council passed on the 10th of February, 1937, the respondent's tender for $365,750.18 was accepted as being the lowest. On the 23rd of February of the same year, a contract was entered into between the appellant and the respondent, embodying the terms and conditions under which the works would be performed.\nIn May, 1938, the contractor Paradis & Farley Inc., respondent in the present case, claimed by petition of right from His Majesty the King the sum of $160,000 for damages and for additional compensation. The Exchequer Court of Canada accepted the argument submitted by the respondent, that the plans and specifications were misleading, that the soil, in which a certain number of piles were to be driven, was of a different nature and harder than indicated in the boring sheets prepared by the Department, and that a certain portion of the works performed was not covered by the contract. The learned trial judge reached the conclusion that, for these additional works, not included in the amount of the tender, the contractor was entitled to $119,597.22. Of this amount, however, he deducted one-third, because he thought there had been loss of time, delay and incompetence attributable to the suppliant. As a result of this deduction, judgment was given for $79,731.48 with interest and costs. Both parties now appeal to this Court, His Majesty the King to have the claim dismissed, and the respondent to have the amount awarded in the Court below increased.\nThe major item of the contract was the furnishing and driving into the soil, at an average depth of 42\u00bd feet below the river bed, of a number of steel piles of interlocking type, on a double parallel row of 700 feet long and 100 feet wide. The unit price for this specific work, tendered by the suppliant, was $1.95 per sq. ft., and it is submitted that this price was based upon the assumption that the soil into which the piles were to be driven, was of \"sand, gravel, few stones, loose clay, stiff and sticky clay, tough clay,\" as revealed by the boring plans and specifications which were declared to be part of the contract. The driving of these piles into a relatively soft material, as described in the boring indications, did not, it is claimed by the respondent, involve work of a very difficult nature and the unit price of $1.95 was sufficient to cover the furnishing and the driving of the piles, leaving a reasonable profit.\nBut the respondent submits that instead of encountering the material it had been led to expect, it encountered what is called \"hard-pan,\" a substance dry in its natural state, devoid of lubricating properties, and plentifully interspersed with large boulders therein embedded, requiring continuous driving for very long periods, and in certain occasions drilling and blasting. And it follows that having done the work after protesting, the respondent was put to very large additional expenses. The claim is not for compensation for works contemplated by the parties and covered by the contract, but is for compensation for other works not foreseen in the agreement, performed \"hors du contrat,\" under an implied contract; it is for works accepted by the Crown for which no compensation has been paid on a \"quantum meruit\" basis.\nI think I should dispose now of the contention that this claim could be based on \"tort\" arising out of the fact that the information given was erroneous and misleading. Although the learned counsel for the respondent did not particularly press this point, he nevertheless stated that he did not abandon it. It is settled, I believe, that there cannot be an action in \"tort\" against the Crown unless it be founded on a statute, and none has been cited to us that could substantiate this claim. On this point the case of Bishop v. MacLaren[1], decided by the Judicial Committee, has no application; and although there is some similarity between that case and the one at bar, there is also the essential difference, that their Lordships had to deal with claims arising between subject and subject, and that we have now to consider a petition against His Majesty.\nIt is particularly on the ground of \"quantum meruit\" for works unforeseen in the agreement that the respondent submits its case, and it is on that ground also that the learned trial judge allowed an additional compensation. The specifications contained the following clauses which are the most important and most relevant to the present issue:\u2014\n2. (b) Steel sheet piling.\u2014Driving interlocking steel sheet piling, where and as shown on plan and as shall be directed by the Engineer.\n4. Soundings and borings.\u2014Soundings, levels and borings have been carefully taken but intending contractors are required to take, before they tender, the soundings, levels and borings they may deem necessary to satisfy themselves as to the accuracy of the information conveyed by plans and specifications.\nShould the contractors find, on the site of the proposed work, any obstruction not shown on the plan, they shall remove such obstruction at their own cost.\nThe Contractors are warned that they shall be held entirely responsible and liable for any increase in the cost of the proposed work, if obstructions have to be removed to permit the driving of the steel sheet piles in correct alignment where and as shown on the plan.\nTenderers are hereby given notice that it shall be taken for granted that the above has been given due consideration in the preparation of their tender.\n6. (3) The unit price tendered shall include the cost of purchasing, transporting, painting, driving and boring the piles, and the cost of the removal of obstructions impeding the driving of the piles, if any.\n35. As it is known that driving will be unusually severe, before the Engineer gives authority for the use of any type of steel piling for this work he will require to be provided with satisfactory evidence as to the driving qualities of the section suggested derived from actual experience in practice.\n37. Notwithstanding this, the contractor shall be entirely responsible for the correctness and accuracy to the satisfaction of the Engineer, in spite of all difficulties including risk of piles meeting obstructions of any kind in the course of the pile driving.\nTenders and general conditions\n(for unit prices)\n4. Contract.\u2014The contractor would be required to sign a contract similar to the form exhibited at the same time as the plans and specifications.\n7. No claim for extra work or materials of any nature will at any time be recognized or entertained by the department unless the contractor has first obtained a written order therefor from the Engineer.\n10. Parties intending to tender for these works are especially requested to visit the place and site of the proposed, work, and make their own estimates of the facilities and difficulties attending the execution of the work, including the uncertainty of weather and all other contingencies.\n37. No claim for extras will be entertained by the department on account of unforeseen difficulties in the carrying out of the work herein specified.\nAs already stated, an Order-in-Council was passed on the 10th of February, 1937, accepting the tender of Paradis & Farley Inc., and on the 23rd day of February, 1938, a contract was signed between the suppliant and His Majesty the King. In the contract there are the following clauses:\u2014\n4. The works shall be constructed by the contractor, and under his personal supervision, of the best materials of their several kinds and finished in the best and most workmanlike manner and in the manner required by and in strict conformity with this contract, the said specifications and special specifications and the plans and drawings relating thereto, and the working or detailed drawings which may from time to time be furnished (which said specifications and special specifications, plans and drawings are hereby declared to be part of this contract), and to the complete satisfaction of the Engineer.\n45. It is distinctly declared that no implied contract of any kind whatsoever by or on behalf of His Majesty shall arise or be implied from anything in this contract contained-, or from any position or situation of the parties at any time, it being clearly understood and agreed that the express contracts, covenants and agreements herein contained and made by His Majesty are and shall be the only contracts, covenants and agreements upon which any rights against His Majesty are to be founded.\nAnd the last two clauses of the contract read as follows:\u2014\n56. This contract is made and entered into by the contractor and His Majesty on the distinct understanding that the contractor has, before execution, investigated and satisfied himself of everything and of every condition affecting the works to be executed and the labour and material to be provided, and that the execution of this contract by the contractor is founded and based upon his own examination, knowledge, information and judgment, and not upon any statement, representation, or information made or given, or upon any information derived from any quantities, dimensions, teste, specifications, plans, maps or profiles made, given or furnished by His Majesty or any of His officers, employees or agents; and that any such statement, representation or information, if so made, given or furnished, was made, given or furnished merely for the general information of bidden; and is not in anywise warranted or guaranteed by or on behalf of His Majesty; and that no extra allowance will be made to the contractor by His Majesty and the contractor will make no claim against His Majesty for any loss or damage sustained in consequence of or by reason of any such statement, representation or information being incorrect or inaccurate, or on account of unforeseen difficulties of any kind.\n57. In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of this contract and the provisions of the specifications forming part hereof the provisions of the specifications shall prevail.\nThe stand taken by the Crown is that the borings and plans were only indicative of the works which were to be performed, and that the tenderer, under the terms of the specifications, was required to take the necessary soundings, levels and borings to satisfy itself as to the accuracy of the information conveyed by the appellant. It is further alleged that there cannot be any additional compensation on a basis of \"quantum meruit,\" the works executed having been contemplated by the parties and covered by the contract. The obligation assumed by the contractor was not to drive the piles in a specified soil, but to drive them in a specified place, \"where, and as shown on the plan,\" whatever the unforeseen difficulties might be.\nI accept the view that the works performed by the respondent were fully covered by the contract, and that the obligation of the suppliant was not to drive piles in a specified soil, but to drive them in a specified place. The words in the specifications \"where and as shown on the plan\" mean clearly that the respondent is obligated to drive these piles in a certain area determined in the plans for the price of $1.95 per sq. ft. It was understood that tenderers were required to take the soundings, levels and borings\nthey may deem necessary to satisfy themselves as to the accuracy of the information conveyed by plans and specifications.\nIn another clause, it is stated:\nThe unit price tendered shall include the cost of purchasing, transporting, painting, driving and boring the piles, and the cost of the removal of obstructions impeding the driving of the piles, if any.\nAnd, further, there is a warning that the driving will be \"unusually severe\" and another clause in which we find that\nthe unit rate to include all charges for supplying, handling, placing, driving, drilling, and tarring the piling used;\nand that the work will have to be done\nin spite of all difficulties including risk of piles meeting obstructions of any kind in the course of the pile driving.\nIt was agreed, that the prices would be held rigidly inclusive, and would cover all contingencies that may happen, and it is obviously for that purpose that clause 37 of the specifications stipulated that\nno claim for extras would be entertained by the department on account of unforeseen difficulties in the carrying out of the works herein specified.\nAs I have already pointed out, it is true that the borings indicate the soil as being \"sand, gravel, few stones, loose clay, stiff and sticky clay, tough clay,\" but, the tenderers were requested to visit the place and make their own estimates of the facilities and difficulties attending the execution of the works, including all contingencies whatever. It is also said in the specifications, that if the suppliant did find any obstructions not shown on the plans, it is its obligation to remove them at its own cost. And in order to facilitate its task, additional information was made available as to the conditions of the soil, but one of the officers of the suppliant refused this information, stating that he had a perfect knowledge of the soil at that particular place. Then, comes clause 56 of the contract in which it is stated that the information given in the plans and the boring sheet is not \"guaranteed or warranted by or on behalf of His Majesty,\" and a further stipulation that the contractor will make no claim against His Majesty \"for loss or damage sustained or on account of unforeseen difficulties of any kind.\"\nIt has been suggested that the contract contains clauses that should be considered as inexistent, because they go beyond the authority given by the Order in Council. This particularly applies to clause 45 which declares that no implied contract\nshall arise from any position or situation of the parties at any time,\nand also to that part of clause 56 which says\nthat any statement, representation or information, if so made, given or furnished, was * * * merely for the general information of bidders, and not in anywise warranted or guaranteed by or on behalf of His Majesty.\nThis would leave the respondent free to rely on an implied contract to claim on a \"quantum meruit\" basis, and would considerably reduce: the devastating effect of clause 56, which in a milder form is also found in the specifications.\nIt seems quite useless to examine if all that has been said on this matter by the Judicial Committee in The King v. Vancouver Lumber Co.[2] finds any application here, because the tender duly signed by the respondent contains a specific clause which precisely covers the point and defeats the objection:\u2014\nContract.\u2014The contractor will be required to sign a contract similar to the form exhibited at the same time as the plans and specifications. The signing of a contract exhibited with the plans and specifications, was a condition of the tender and, therefore, all its clauses were duly authorized by the Order in Council of February the 10th and are binding upon the parties, who had a complete knowledge of its contents.\nThe suppliant tendered to furnish and drive these piles in a soil the nature of which it agreed to investigate, and which the appellant did not guarantee, but merely indicated with the reserves above mentioned, as being of \"sand, gravel, few stones, loose clay, stiff and sticky clay, tough clay.\" The risk was upon the suppliant, and having assumed it, it must necessarily bear all the consequences, financial and others, if it misjudged the works to be performed and miscalculated the cost of the enterprise. Expenses incurred for unforeseen difficulties must be considered as being included in the amount of the tender, and the respondent has the legal obligation to execute the contract for the price agreed upon, in the same way as would have been its undisputable right to benefit, if the soil had been more favourable and easier than foreseen.\nThe Court is bound by the terms of the contract, which is the law of the parties. And there is also the statutory law which supports the stand taken by the Crown, and which to my mind has the effect of thoroughly destroying the suppliant's submission. The Exchequer Court of Canada, under section 18 of the Exchequer Court Act, has exclusive original jurisdiction in all cases in which the claim arises out of a contract entered into by or on behalf of the Crown. And section 48 of the same Act limits the jurisdiction of the Court, and does not allow it to grant any additional compensation. This section reads as follows:\u2014\n48. In adjudicating upon any claim arising out of any contract in writing, the Court shall decide in accordance with the stipulations in such contract, and shall not allow\n(a) compensation to any claimant on the ground that he expended a larger sum of money in the performance of his Gontract than the amount stipulated for therein;\nHaving come to the conclusion that the works performed are covered by the contract, it seems impossible to allow any additional compensation, without doing violence to the unequivocal terms of this section. For these reasons, the respondent cannot succeed; but even if the claim of the respondent were not covered by the contract, it would still fail, for it would have to be founded on an implied contract; and, on this point it is unnecessary to discuss the case of Nova Scotia Construction v. The Quebec Streams Commission (1) in view of the clear declaration of the parties in the agreement,\nthat no implied contract of any kind whatsoever, by or on behalf of His Majesty, shall arise or be implied from anything in this contract contained.\nIt follows that the appeal should be allowed, the petition of right dismissed as well as the cross-appeal, with costs throughout in both issues.\nAppeal allowed and cross-appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Valmore Bienvenue.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Vien. Faribault & Trudeau.\n[1] [1937] 2 D.L.R. 625.\n[2] (1919) 50 D.L.R. 6.\n",

The action was instituted for an accounting of all commissions received directly or indirectly by or on behalf of the above-mentioned company in connection with orders for merchandise sent by or on behalf of persons, firms or corporations in Canada or in the United States, in pursuance of an agreement herein described; in default of which the appellant asked that each defendant be condemned to pay him the sum of $225,000 as reliquat de compte. The respondent and the other defendants moved, by way of declinatory exception, that the action be dismissed on the ground that the Superior Court of the district of Montreal was not competent to hear the issue with regard to them. An agreement had originally been entered into between a certain partnership, carrying on business as wine and spirit merchants in the city of London, England, under the style of Trower and Sons, called \"the Firm\", and the appellant Ripstein and the defendant Gillespie, both of the city of Montreal. The Firm was to open, at their own expense, for the sale of their goods', an office in Montreal, called \"Canadian office\" and to appoint the defendant Redpath as its manager, Gillespie and Ripstein undertaking to use their best endeavours to introduce customers in Canada and the United States. The commission on all orders obtained by the Firm from these customers, whether obtained direct by the Firm or through Gillespie and Ripstein, were to be credited to the Canadian office. The Firm was to send credit notes from the London office to the Canadian office, showing the amount of commission to be allowed to the Canadian office, such commission being the difference between the cost price of the goods shipped by the Firm to Canada and the price at which such goods were invoiced to customers in Canada or the United States. Payment was to be made by customers direct to the Firm's London office, and the Firm was to remit to the Canadian office monthly the commission due to the latter on all sales in respect of which payment had been received. The \"net commission\" of the Canadian office, after deduction of the expenses of carrying on the same, was to be divided, one-third each, between the Firm, Gillespie and the appellant Ripstein. Later on, the respondent company purchased the business of the Firm and undertook to carry on under the agreement. The respondent company's motion, by way of declinatory exception, was maintained and the action, as against the respondent, was dismissed by the Superior Court, whose judgment was affirmed by the appellate court.\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed from (Q.R. 69 K.B. 424), Davis and Hudson JJ. dissenting, that, under the circumstances of the case, all the essential facts, which together ought to give rise to the action brought by the appellant, i.e., the whole cause of his action, as constituted, had arisen in the city and district of Montreal, before the courts of which appellant was entitled to institute his action, under article 94 (3) C.C.P., and the declinatory exception should have been dismissed.\u2014The whole business covered by the agreement, whatever be its nature, was, in the intention of the parties, to be, and was, carried on in and from the Canadian office; and the appellant's action was for an accounting of the \"net commission\", i.e. for an accounting of the business carried on in and through the Canadian office, in the city and district of Montreal, where the seat of the business was located.\nPer Rinfret, Crocket and Taschereau JJ.\u2014The provisions of article 94 C.C.P. are broad enough to include within their ambit any defendant, be he a foreigner, a stranger or not; and it was the evident intention of the legislature of Quebec, as expressed in that article, to grant to the Quebec courts jurisdiction over aliens or parties outside the province, if the whole cause of action arose therein.\nPer Rinfret, Crocket and Taschereau JJ.\u2014No opinion is expressed as to whether the agreement should be styled a partnership, or an agency agreement, or a contract of lease and hire of service, nor as to whether the declinatory exception was also wrong on any of the other grounds raised by it and decided by the judgments appealed from.\nPer Davis J. (dissenting)\u2014The making or assuming of the contract by the respondent company in the city of London, England, the receipt of payments by that company there from Canadian and American sales, the failure of the company \"to remit\" from London to Montreal certain commissions on these sales, and probably other facts necessary to establish the alleged cause of action, did not arise within the jurisdiction of the Quebec court.\nPer Hudson J. (dissenting).\u2014The agreement itself was made in London, England, the moneys were collected by the defendants there and not in Canada, contracts were made with a number of distillers and liquor dealers in London and in New York and moreover the appellant asked for an accounting in respect of all transactions had and done, whether in Canada, in the United States or in England, and, therefore, it cannot be said that the whole cause of action arose within the district of Montreal. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, D\u00e9cary J., and maintaining the company respondent's motion, by way of declinatory exception, that the appellant's action for an accounting be dismissed on the ground that the Superior Court had no jurisdiction to hear the issue in the case.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nH. Weinfield K.C. for the appellant.\nR. C. Holden K.C. and G. B. Puddicombe for the respondent.\nThe Judgment of Rinfret, Crocket and Taschereau JJ. was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014The appellant brought this action in the district of Montreal, province of Quebec, against the respondent, described in the writ of summons as being\na body politic and corporate duly incorporated and having its head-office and principal place of business in the city of London, in that part of Great Britain called England;\nand also against Thomas S. Gillespie and Thomas Redpath, both of the district of Montreal, summoned as co-defendants with the respondent.\nThe action is to the effect\nthat the defendants and each of them be ordered and condemned to render * * * a true and accurate accounting to plaintiff, accompanied by vouchers (pi\u00e8ces justificatives), showing all transactions had and done by the defendants, or either of them * * * not only in the name of and on behalf of the Canadian partnership, but also under the name of Redpath & Company and under the name of the defendant Redpath and in the name of or through the defendant Gillespie and under the name of or through the defendant Trower & Sons Limited, and this whether in Canada or in the United States of America, or in England, for account of the Canadian partnership, in connection with the products of the defendant Trower & Sons Limited, or in connection with the firms, or either of them mentioned in (the declaration); and also showing in detail all assets of every nature and kind whatsoever belonging to the Canadian partnership, or to which it is legally entitled, including * * * all profits, salaries, bonuses, commissions or other remuneration, directly or indirectly, received by the defendants, or either of them * * * in connection with the business of the Canadian partnership and in connection with the products of the firm mentioned (in the declaration); and also showing in detail the surplus and good-will of the said Canadian partnership. A similar action had previously been instituted in London, England, between the same parties; but, as stated at bar, it has since been discontinued.\nThe Canadian action was served upon the defendants Gillespie and Redpath in the district of Montreal, where they have their domicile, and upon the defendant Trower & Sons Limited (respondent) through a notice published in newspapers in the district of Montreal, pursuant to art. 136 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\nThe respondents moved, by way of declinatory exception, that the action be dismissed in so far as they were concerned, on the ground that the appellant could not institute the action against them in the district of Montreal and that the Superior Court of that district was not competent to hear the issue with regard to them.\nThe declinatory exception of the respondent was maintained and the action as against the respondent was dismissed by the Superior Court, whose judgment was confirmed by the Court of King's Bench, appeal side[2].\nThe appellant justified the course followed by him on several grounds in respect of which he contended that the courts of the district of Montreal had jurisdiction over the respondent: that the contracts were made in Montreal; that the other defendants resided in Montreal, were served there and that accordingly all defendants could be brought before the court of the district in which one of them was validly summoned; that the relationship between the appellant and the respondent, as well as the other defendants, constituted a partnership and the action for accounting and partition in a partnership may be instituted where the accounting is due and where the partition is to be made; that the respondent had properties in the district of Montreal; that the courts of the district of Montreal could assert jurisdiction over the respondent by force of the general rule concerning jurisdiction of the courts of Quebec resulting from article 27 of the Civil Code, whereby\naliens, although not resident in Lower Canada, may be sued in its courts for the fulfilment of obligations contracted by them in foreign countries.\nIn the courts of the province of Quebec the appellant failed, and he now submits on appeal to this Court the several grounds upon which he based his contestation of the respondent's declinatory exception. In my view of the matter, it is immaterial whether the agreement between the parties was made verbally in London, England, or made in writing and signed, first in England by the respondent, and subsequently in Montreal by the other defendants and by the appellant (where, therefore, it was actually completed as a binding contract).\nThe material point is that the written document, alleged and invoked by the appellant, contains the full terms and expresses the true effect of the agreement entered into by the parties.\nNor do I find it necessary to decide whether the agreement should be styled a partnership, or an agency agreement, or a contract of lease and hire of service. This point may well be left to be decided on the merits of the case, after the parties have had the opportunity of adducing fuller and more complete evidence than it was possible for them to put forward on the issue restricted to the question of jurisdiction.\nFor the purposes of the present appeal, and whether the appellant is right or not in calling the agreement a partnership, the courts must look at the allegations of the declaration and its conclusions considered in the light of the true substance of the contract itself. Thus will be ascertained the cause of the appellant's action and the place where it has arisen, conformably to paragraph 3 of art. 94 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\nIf the whole cause of action arose in the district of Montreal, this is sufficient, under art. 94 (3), to allow the appellant to institute his action in that district, independently of any other ground upon which he may have justified his course.\nThe original agreement was entered into between Agnes Marian Bence Trower, Richard Alexander Bence Trower and Henry Arthur Bence Trower, of the city of London, carrying on business in co-partnership under the style of Trower and Sons as wine and spirit merchants, of the first part, and Thomas Stevenson Gillespie and Hyman Mendel Ripstein (the appellant), both of Montreal, respectively of the second and the third part.\nIn the agreement, the partnership of Trower and Sons is called \"the Firm\".\nIt was agreed that the Firm would open, at their own expense, an office at Drummond Building, or elsewhere in Montreal, in the province of Quebec, Canada, for the sale of their goods, and that they would appoint Thomas Redpath (one of the defendants) as the manager of such office, which, in the agreement, is referred to as the \"Canadian Office\".\nGillespie and Ripstein undertook to use their best endeavours to introduce customers in Canada and the United States to the Firm.\nThe commission on all orders obtained by the Firm from customers in Canada and the United States, whether obtained direct by the Firm or through Gillespie or Ripstein, was to be credited to the Canadian office. The firm was to send credit notes from their London office to the Canadian office, showing the amount of commission to be allowed to the Canadian office in respect of sales of goods comprised in each shipment.\nIt is stated that, for the purposes of the agreement, \"commission\" shall mean the difference between the cost price of the goods shipped by the Firm to Canada (including duty, freight and insurance) and the price at which such goods are invoiced to customers in Canada or the United States.\nPayment is to be made by customers direct to the Firm's London office, and the Firm is to remit to the Canadian office monthly the commission due to the Canadian office on all sales in respect of which payment has been received.\nThe expense of establishing the Canadian office and all expenses of carrying on the same, including the salary, commissions or other remunerations of Redpath (the manager), and of all necessary clerks, servants and travellers employed by the Firm in Canada and the United States are to be debited to the Canadian office.\nThe \"net commission\" of the Canadian office, after deduction of the expenses above mentioned, is to belong as to one-third to the Firm, as to one-third to Gillespie and as to one-third to Ripstein, and to be divided accordingly at the Canadian office on the thirty-first day of December in every year or oftener, if the parties shall so agree.\nThe agreement is to take effect as of the 27th day of March, 1927; and any party thereto shall be entitled to terminate the agreement by giving to the others six calendar months' notice in that behalf. By a supplementary memorandum, it was understood that the agreement was for a period of five years, with the option of a renewal of a further five years at the end of that period.\nThe respondent Trower & Sons Limited later took over the operations of Trower and Sons, and, among others, the business of the Canadian office in Montreal. Accordingly they became responsible for the operations under the agreement; and that is why they were made defendants, instead of the \"Firm\", whose business they had purchased and undertook to carry on.\nThe analysis which has just been made of the contract between the parties shows that, whatever may be the exact nature of the relationship thus created between the appellant, the other defendants and the respondent, the object of the agreement between them was the carrying on of the business there described, in the city and the district of Montreal. The seat of that business called the \"Canadian Office\" was opened and maintained\nat Drummond Building or elsewhere in Montreal, in the province of Quebec, Canada.\nThe manager of such office was the defendant Redpath, in the district of Montreal.\nThe business to be carried on under the agreement, the transactions contemplated by the agreement, \"the cash, monies received and monies paid out\" were carried \"through the books of Gillespie & Company, in Montreal\"; and so was the banking done in connection with the Canadian business. This was established by the evidence of Redpath, the manager, without any contradiction.\nIt is also proven that the books and records and the accounts of the concern were kept in Montreal.\nIt was so far intended by the parties that the business carried on under the agreement was to be a Canadian business with situs in Montreal, that in connection with the signature of the contract between the respondent, the appellant and the other defendants, the partnership of Trower & Sons caused to be registered in Montreal a declaration signed by the several Trower partners certifying that they\ncarry on and intend to carry on business as wine and spirit merchants, at Drummond Building, St. Catherine street west, in the city of Montreal, under the name and firm of Trower & Sons. It follows from what precedes that the relationship, resulting from the agreement of the parties, centred upon the \"net commission\" of the Canadian office in Montreal, in respect of which alone the signatories of the document had joint interests and in the division of which exclusively the appellant was to participate.\nWhatever be the nature of the agreement, it is apparent that, in the intention of the parties, the whole business covered by it was to be, and was, carried on in and from the Canadian office, in the city and district of Montreal, where the seat of the business was stated to have been established.\nNow, on the face of the record and of the allegations and conclusions of the declaration, the appellant's action is for an accounting of the \"net commission\", and that is to say: for an accounting of the business carried on in and through the Canadian office in the city and district of Montreal.\nIt is not to the point to say that such business had ramifications outside of the district of Montreal, throughout the province of Quebec, Canada and the United States. The business itself was located in the city and district of Montreal and none the less so because certain of its transactions spread throughout Canada and the United States. The business and the transactions originated in the Canadian office in Montreal, whence the goods were shipped and invoiced to customers and where books, records and accounts were kept.\nAn accounting of that business and of those transactions was what the appellant prayed for in his action against the respondent; and all the essential facts which together gave rise to the action brought by the appellant, or, in other words: the whole cause of his action as constituted has arisen in the city and district of Montreal, before the courts of which the appellant was entitled to institute his action under paragraph 3 of art. 94 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\nThere may be some doubt whether the respondent Trower & Sons Limited may, for the purposes of the declinatory exception which they made, be looked upon as being domiciled outside the province of Quebec, in view of the fact that, in this case, they merely represent the interests of Trower & Sons (the partnership or \"the Firm\") and that the said firm of Trower and Sons had caused to be registered, in the district of Montreal, a declaration that it was carrying on \"business as wine and spirit merchants at Drummond Building, St. Catherine street west, in the city of Montreal, under the name and firm of Trower and Sons\". It may be a debatable question whether the limited company representing the Firm as it does here, and brought into the case as defendants in lieu of Trower and Sons (the partnership) so registered, should not, for the purposes of this case, be considered as carrying on business in Montreal. But the fact remains that, whether the domicile of the Firm was in London, England, or in Montreal, Canada,\u2014with regard to the business about which we are concerned, and, for jurisdiction purposes in this case, it may well be argued that such domicile and residence should be held to be at the seat of the Canadian office, in Montreal.\nBe that as it may, the whole cause of action having arisen in the city and district of Montreal, there can be no doubt that the respondent in the premises could be brought before the courts of the city of Montreal upon an action to account for the business and transactions carried on in the \"Canadian Office\" situated in Montreal.\nIt has never been disputed that the provisions of art. 94 C.C.P. are broad enough to include within their ambit any defendant, be he a foreigner, a stranger or not; and it was the evident intention of the legislature of Quebec, as expressed in that article, to grant to the Quebec courts jurisdiction over aliens or parties outside the province, if the whole cause of action arose therein (Fraser v. Beyers-Allen Lumber Company[3]; Gosset v. Robin[4]; \u00c1rchambault v. Bolduc[5].)\nAccordingly, upon that ground, the appellant was right in bringing the respondent before the Superior Court of the district of Montreal, in the province of Quebec; and the declinatory exception should have been dismissed with costs.\nAs it becomes unnecessary to discuss whether the declinatory exception was also wrong on any of the other grounds raised by it, it should be understood that we refrain to approve or disapprove of the reasons given for the judgments appealed from in respect thereof. The appeal should be allowed with costs throughout and the record should be returned to the Superior Court there to be proceeded with on the merits of the action.\nDavis J. (dissenting).\u2014This appeal arises out of the trial of a preliminary issue in the action to determine whether or not the Superior Court of the province of Quebec in and for the district of Montreal has jurisdiction to entertain this action against one of the defendants, Trower & Sons, Limited (for convenience hereinafter referred to as the company). Mr. Justice D\u00e9cary, who tried the issue in the Superior Court, dismissed the action as against the company on the ground that the Superior Court did not have jurisdiction. That judgment was unanimously affirmed on appeal by the Court of King's Bench (appeal side) of the province of Quebec. The plaintiff appealed further to this Court.\nThe company is an English corporation having its domicil in London, England, where its head office and principal place of business are situate. It was incorporated in 1929 and shortly after its incorporation acquired the assets of an English partnership known as \"Trower & Sons\", which firm had in 1927 entered into an agreement with the appellant and one Gillespie, both of the city of Montreal, for the furtherance of the sale of the firm's liquors in Canada and the United States. Payment was to be made by customers direct to the firm's London office and the agreement provided that certain commissions in respect of payments on sales obtained by the firm from customers in Canada and the United States, whether obtained directly by the firm or through the appellant or Gillespie, were to be \"remitted\" to a Canadian office and (after payment thereout of certain local expenses referred to in the agreement) were to be divided at the Canadian office at the end of each year, one-third to the firm, one-third to the appellant and one-third to Gillespie. There was a good deal of argument before us as to whether or not this agreement, which was not made under seal, was made in London or in Montreal. In the English action to which I shall presently refer the appellant pleaded that the agreement was made in England. In the Quebec action it was only by an amendment made to his original declaration that the appellant pleaded it was made in Montreal. Both courts below have examined into the facts and have concluded that the agreement was made in England. This, of course, is the agreement with the partnership; not an agreement with the company.\nThis action was brought by the appellant in the province of Quebec against Gillespie and one Redpath (both residents of the province of Quebec) and the company, for an accounting of all commissions received directly or indirectly by or on behalf of the company in connection with orders for merchandise sent by or on behalf of persons, firms or corporations in Canada or in the United States; in default of which the plaintiff asks that each defendant be condemned to pay him the sum of $225,000 as reliquat de compte.\nAt the date of the institution of this action there was pending for trial in London an action instituted there by the appellant, as plaintiff, against the same parties\u2014the company, Gillespie and Redpath\u2014alleging the same cause of action and seeking the same accounting and payment on the footing of the accounts to be taken. That action had been commenced by writ issued July 22nd, 1935. The Quebec action was not commenced until June 22nd, 1938. The only material difference between the English and the Quebec actions was that the appellant in his Quebec action (not originally but by amendment) set up a partnership among the parties to the action, obviously for the purpose of endeavouring to create a jurisdiction in the Quebec court on the basis that the company was a partner of the other parties defendant to the action and on the appellant's contention could therefore, under the Quebec practice and procedure, be added as a party defendant in the action. There is as a matter of fact no proof that the company ever entered into any agreement with the appellant; reliance was had entirely upon the agreement made with the English partnership prior to the incorporation of the company. I am satisfied, as were all the judges in the courts below, that on the proper construction of the document there was no partnership between the parties defendant to the action.\nWe were informed by counsel during the argument, though it is not part of the record, that since the commencement of the Quebec action the English action has been dismissed with costs, the appellant having failed to comply with an order made in the English action for security for costs. But the English action was pending for trial at the time of the commencement of this similar action in Quebec, and I should think that in itself may have made the Quebec action a vexatious one sufficient to have entitled the company to have it dismissed. But the courts below have dismissed the action as against the company upon the ground of want of jurisdiction in the Court. The company was not served personally (it was summoned merely by publication in Montreal newspapers) though it appeared to contest the jurisdiction of the court over it. Further, when the action was instituted, the company had no known office or place of business in the province of Quebec and no officer, agent or representative there. Neither had the company any assets in the province of Quebec. Upon those facts the courts below have held there was no jurisdiction over the company in this action in the courts of the province of Quebec.\nIt cannot be said, in my opinion, that the Quebec court is \"the court of the place where the whole cause of action has arisen\", within the meaning of article 94 (3) of the Quebec Code of Civil Procedure. The Quebec authorities to which we were referred as to the meaning of \"the whole cause of action\" are in agreement with the Ontario authorities on similar words, i.e., all the material facts which must be proved in order to entitle the plaintiff to recover must have arisen within the jurisdiction of the Court. The English decisions, to like effect, are collected in Hals. 2nd ed., vol. 1, p. 8. In this case, the making or assuming of a contract by the company, the receipt of payments by the company in London from Canadian and American sales, the failure of the company \"to remit\" from London to Montreal certain commissions on these sales, and probably other facts necessary to establish the alleged cause of action, did not arise within the jurisdiction of the Quebec court.\nIt was contended for the appellant that article 103 of the Quebec Code of Civil Procedure entitled the appellant to bring the company before the Quebec court. The relevant part of the article reads as follows:\n103. In matters purely personal, if there are several defendants in the same action residing in different districts, they may all be brought before the court of the district in which one of them has been summoned, provided that such summons be not made with the intention of withdrawing the real parties from the courts which would otherwise have jurisdiction. It was argued by counsel for the appellant that that article entitled the appellant to bring the English company before the Quebec court as one of \"several defendants in the same action residing in different districts.\" But the word \"districts\" in the article plainly means judicial districts within the province of Quebec. The article has no application to a person resident outside the province of Quebec. Mr. Justice Barclay in the Court of King's Bench has carefully canvassed that point. It was urged that such an interpretation of the article leaves no provision in the Code, in an action purely personal where there are several defendants residing in different places, to bring before the court a person residing outside the province of Quebec. There may be a casus omissus (I have not felt it necessary to consider that) but that would not entitle the Court to construe the article in any other way than its plain language requires.\nI should dismiss the appeal with costs.\nHudson J. (dissenting).\u2014The questions involved in this appeal are largely matters of practice and procedure governed by the Quebec Code of Civil Procedure and, in view of the unanimous opinion of the judges in the court below, I would be disposed to dismiss this appeal without further comment. But my brother Rinfret has taken a point which, while mentioned in the court below, was apparently not seriously discussed, that is, whether or not the whole cause of action arose in Montreal, so as to bring the plaintiff's claim within the provisions of article 94 (3) of the Code of Civil Procedure, which reads as follows:\n94. In matters purely personal, other than those mentioned in articles 96, 97, 98, 103 and 104, the defendant may always, notwithstanding any stipulation, agreement or undertaking to the contrary, be summoned:\n***\n3. Before the court of the place where the whole cause of action has arisen * * *\nIt seems to me that the whole cause of action referred to in this article must signify all of the facts, causes, moyens and motifs alleged in the declaration, which, if traversed, must be proven. This interpretation has been placed on the article by many decisions in the courts of Quebec.\nIn the present action, as stated by my brother Rinfret, the place from where the services rendered by the plaintiffs radiated was Montreal; there was the office where the accounts were kept and where the eventual division of profits was to be made. On the other hand, the contract itself was made in London, England. Moneys collected as a consequence of plaintiffs' work were collected by the defendants in London, not in Canada, and although the plaintiffs ask for an accounting in respect of business done at or through Montreal, yet they also say that the defendants made a contract with a number of distillers and liquor dealers in London and in New York, in the profits of which they were entitled to participate, and in their prayer they ask for an accounting by the defendants, Trower and Sons, Limited, in respect of all transactions had and done * * * by or under the name of or through the defendants, Trower and Sons, Limited, and this whether in Canada or in the United States of America or in England.\nIn view of these claims, with respect I cannot see how it can be said that the whole cause of action here arose within the district of Montreal and, for that reason, I would dismiss the appeal.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Weinfield & Rudenko.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Meredith, Holden, Heward & Holden.\n[1] (1940) Q.R. 69 K.B. 424.\n[2] (1940) Q.R., 69 K.B., 424.\n[3] 1913) Q.R. 45 S.C. 42, at 53.\n[4] (1876) 2 Q.L.R. 91, at 107, 108.\n[5] (1881) 2 Decisions de la Cour d'Appel, 110.\n",

The ship New York News, owned by the Quebec and Ontario Transportation Company, Limited, and the ship Fort Willdoc, owned by Paterson Steamships Limited, collided in Lake Superior, during a dense fog, the visibility being limited to between two and three hundred feet, while proceeding in opposite directions on or about the courses usually followed by ships bound from Port Arthur or Fort William down the Great Lakes, or vice versa. The collision happened at 5.30 a.m., nine miles west of Passage Island. That point was passed by the Fort Willdoc at 4.34 a.m., this distance of nine miles being therefore made by her in 56 minutes, at an average speed of more than nine miles an hour. At 5.15 a.m. a fog signal ahead, given by the New York News, was heard by the Fort Willdoc, whose engines were ordered to slow speed ahead; and, almost simultaneously, the Fort Willdoc blew one blast signal, thus indicating that she was directing her course to starboard. At about the same moment, the New York News gave a double blast signal, thus making known her intention to direct her course to port. If each had proceeded according to these signals, a collision would have been inevitable. After a period of between one-half and three-quarters of a minute following the double blast signal of the New York News, the Fort Willdoc gave herself a two-blast signal, thus signifying her compliance with the course declared by the New York News. Witnesses for the appellant testified that the master of the Fort Willdoc altered her course twenty-two degrees to port and proceeded at a reduced speed to meet the New York News starboard to starboard. During the above-mentioned interval of one half to three-quarters of a minute, the New York News went full astern on her engines, in order to avoid an inevitable collision, and her master testified that, when he heard the two-blast signal of the Fort Willdoc, it was then too late for him to conform to the course thus indicated. Subsequently both ships gave fog signals. Then, the Fort Willdoc, suddenly hearing a danger signal, reversed immediately her engines full speed astern, about one minute preceding the moment of the collision, but could not avoid coming into contact with the New York News, which was crossing her bow. Both ships came into collision, the stem of the Fort Willdoc hitting the port side of the New York News with the result that both suffered severe damages. The local judge in Admiralty for the province of Quebec, L. Cannon J., holding that the New York News was responsible for the collision, maintained the action brought by the Fort Willdoc against the respondent here and dismissed the counter-claim. The Exchequer Court of Canada, Maclean J., reversed that judgment and held that both vessels were equally at fault in bringing about the collision.\nHeld, Duff C.J. and Crocket J. dissenting, that the New York News was the only party to blame and therefore responsible for the collision and that the judgment of the local judge in Admiralty should be restored.\nHeld, also, as to the ground raised by the respondent that before the accident the Fort Willdoc was proceeding at an excessive rate of speed and thus contributed to the accident, that, assuming it to be so, this would have happened before 5.15 a.m. when the first blasts of the whistles were heard; and, in view of what occurred afterwards, that there is no possible relation between this previous speed and the collision and that such speed could not have any bearing whatever upon the issue of liability in the present case. The Pemaquid (255 Federal Rep. 709) foll.\u2014Duff C.J. and Crocket J. dissenting.\nPer Rinfret, Hudson and Taschereau JJ.\u2014The duties of each steamer approaching each other head to head or on the starboard of each other are indicated in rules 22 and 25 of the \"Rules of the Road for the Great Lakes.\" In this case, both ships were not coming head to head, but were slightly on the starboard side of each other. The one-blast signal of the Fort Willdoc and the two-blast signal of the New York News were not cross-signals, as they were given almost simultaneously, and the captain of the latter so understood them. If at that moment, there has been any confusion, it was for a very short time, because immediately after the two-blast signal of the Fort Willdoc, her captain ordered her twenty-two degrees to port in order to meet starboard to starboard. The captain of the New York News admitted having heard this last signal; if it had been otherwise, it was his duty to give immediately the danger signal, which he did not give. There was perfect understanding by both ships as to how they would meet and if such understanding had been followed, there would have been no collision. The sole and determining cause of the accident was the failure of the New York News to follow the course agreed upon, and to proceed, without giving the necessary signals, in a direction unknown to the Fort Willdoc and which she had no reason to foresee.\nPer Duff C.J. and Crocket J. (dissenting)\u2014Both ships were to blame in proceeding at full speed in a dense fog contrary to rule 19 and both violated the same rule in not immediately reducing speed to bare steerage way on hearing; fog signals, and not navigating with caution until they had passed each other; it is no defence for one ship to say that the fog signals of the other appeared to be far away.\u2014Upon the facts, the Fort Willdoc was greatly in fault and such fault was a contributing factor in bringing about the collision\u2014The average speed of the Fort Willdoc, more than nine miles an hour, in a dense fog, the visibility being; limited to between two and three hundred feet, did not come within the category of \"moderate speed\", as explicitly required by rule 19 and as every consideration of good seamanship would dictate: the speed of a vessel shall not be so great as to render it impossible to stop within the \"limits of observation.\"\u2014Both ships in the circumstances here erred in not giving a danger signal promptly under rules 21 and 22.\u2014Prompt action from both ships, i.e., instant action, was demanded under the circumstances. If the Fort Willdoc had instantly signified her compliance with the course declared by the New York News, the disaster might have been avoided.\u2014A delay of over half a minute before giving a signal, in the conditions of the moment, was not a prompt answer within the meaning of the rules.\u2014The evidence does not show anything in the nature of an agreement between the two ships, resulting from the exchange of signals, that they were to follow a course starboard to starboard; and the final manoeuvre of the New York News was justified under rule 37.\nJudgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada ([1941] Ex. C.R. 145) reversed, Duff C.J. and Crocket J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, Maclean J.[1], reversing the judgment of the local judge in Admiralty for the province of Quebec, Lucien Cannon J. The trial judge held that the New York News was solely responsible for the collision and he maintained the action brought by the Fort Willdoc against the respondent and dismissed the latter's counter-claim. The President of the Exchequer Court of Canada allowed the appeal to that Court to the extent of declaring that both vessels were equally at fault in bringing about the collision and referred the matter to the Registrar of the Quebec Admiralty District to assess the damages. The owners of the Fort Willdoc appealed to this Court in order to have the judgment of the trial judge restored.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nC. R. McKenzie K.C. and Geo. Montgomery Jr. for the appellants.\nLucien Beauregard K.C. for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice (dissenting)\u2014At the close of the argument of this appeal I had reached a provisional opinion that the judgment of the learned trial judge ought to be restored. I have since had an opportunity, however, of reading more critically the reasons of the learned President of the Exchequer Court in light of a more minute examination of the evidence and my conclusion is that the learned President of the Exchequer Court has given convincing reasons for holding, as he does, that the Fort Willdoc was gravely in fault and that this fault was a contributing factor in bringing about the collision.\nThe collision occurred on the morning of the 11th of September, 1938, and the ships concerned were the New York News, a steel ship of 2,310 gross tons of the canal type, having a length of 256 feet over all, which was on a voyage from Port Arthur to Montreal laden with grain; and the Fort Willdoc, a single screw steamship of 4,542 gross tons, having a keel length of 416 feet, which was proceeding light in the opposite direction from Port Col-borne to Fort William. The maximum speed of the New York News loaded was seven knots and that of the Fort Willdoc was approximately eleven and one-half knots. There was a dense fog, the visibility being limited to between two and three hundred feet, about one-half of the keel length of the Fort Willdoc.\nThe owners of the Fort Willdoc appeal and the only issue with which we are concerned is whether the judgment of the learned trial judge absolving the Fort Willdoc from all blame and putting the responsibility for the entire loss upon the New York News ought to be restored, and we are concerned, therefore, primarily with the navigation of the Fort Willdoc.\nIt appears from the evidence adduced on both sides that the collision happened at nine miles west of Passage Island, and, from an entry in the log of the Fort Willdoc, Passage Island was passed by her at 4.34 a.m., and from another entry in the same log the collision happened at 5.30 a.m. This distance of nine miles was therefore made in 56 minutes; or at an average speed of more than nine miles an hour. Obviously such a speed in a dense fog, the visibility being as I have mentioned, does not come within the category of moderate speed, as explicitly required by Rule 19 and as every consideration of good seamanship would dictate.\nAdmittedly the Fort Willdoc proceeded at full speed from 4.34 a.m. to 5.15 a.m., when it is said that the fog signal of the New York News was heard and the engines of the Fort Willdoc were ordered slow. In this interval the Fort Willdoc would have made 7\u00b785 miles, there being no wind that could affect her speed, and, consequently, in the interval between 5.15 and 5.30, fifteen minutes, she made a distance of 1\u00b715 miles. There is agreement among the witnesses called on behalf of the appellants that the engines of the Fort Willdoc were reversed for one minute preceding the moment of collision, and it seems a fair inference, therefore, that during this interval the average speed of the ship was five miles per hour. The learned trial judge found that at the moment of impact, after her engines had been reversed for one minute, as I have said, her speed did not exceed two or three miles per hour. As the learned President of the Exchequer Court of Canada says, both ships were proceeding on or about the courses usually frequented by ships in Lake Superior, bound from Port Arthur or Fort William to eastern Canadian ports on the Great Lakes, and vice versa. The duties resting upon navigators in respect of the navigation of a ship, circumstanced as the Fort Willdoc was on the morning in question, are known by every seaman. Rule 19 explicitly provides that the vessel shall go \"at a moderate speed\". In the application of the rule it has been treated as imposing a limitation by which the speed of the vessel shall not be so great as to render it impossible to stop within the \"limits of observation\". In the case of the Fort Willdoc that would mean, in the conditions prevailing on the occasion in question, roughly within the limits of half her length. The reason for the rule is well known. Sounds are notoriously deceptive in a fog and the vessel is, therefore, without any reliable clue of the position of other vessels in proximity to her. The Fort Willdoc, as we have seen, proceeded at full speed for 56 minutes\u2014in other words, in reckless disregard of the obligations imposed upon her master by the existing conditions. At 5.15 the Fort Willdoc first heard a fog signal ahead and upon hearing this signal her engines were ordered from full speed to slow speed ahead. At about the same time the Fort Willdoc blew one blast and this, of course, would indicate that she was directing her course to starboard. The impression of the captain and mate seems to have been that the vessel approaching from ahead was on the starboard bow of the Fort Willdoc and it is admitted by the mate that, having regard to the true positions of the ships, the proper action would have been to blow two whistles and to direct her course to starboard. This, the mate said, would have been done, if they had known the true positions. They surmised, however, that the New York News was far off and, that it was quite safe to give the single blast signal. As the learned President says, the signal was not one that was seriously considered, because of this mistaken surmise.\nAt the same moment that the Fort Willdoc gave her single blast signal the New York News gave a double blast signal. These two inconsistent signals obviously disclosed a situation of danger\u2014one ship declared she was directing her course to starboard, the other declared she was directing her course to port. If each proceeded according to the signal given by her a collision would be inevitable. I entirely agree with the learned President of the Exchequer Court of Canada that prompt action from both sides, that is to say, instant action, was demanded. If the Fort Willdoc had instantly signified her compliance with the course declared by the New York News, it is possible that disaster might have been avoided. One thing was quite clear, that delay would add to the danger; yet this is precisely the fault into which the Fort Willdoc fell. She waited for a period which was between one-half a minute and three-quarters of a minute before apprising the New York News of her intentions. That which happened in the interval was what might have been expected, what the master of the Fort Willdoc might have realized would likely happen; the New York News, interpreting the signal from the Fort Willdoc as manifesting an intention to cross her bow, immediately went full astern on her engines. That was a natural and proper course, (if not the only course open to the New York News) as the learned President of the Exchequer Court of Canada, on the advice of his assessor, finds. When the master of the New York News heard the two-blast signal of the Fort Willdoc it was too late for him to conform to the course declared by this signal from the Fort Willdoc, as the learned President of the Exchequer Court of Canada, again on the advice of his assessor, finds.\nI am unable to agree with the contention of the appellants that there was anything in the nature of an agreement between the Fort Willdoc and the New York News resulting from the exchange of signals that they were to follow a course starboard to starboard. The learned trial judge finds there was and bases it upon an admission which he derives from the evidence of the captain and crew of the New York News. The evidence of the captain describes the course of events as I have given them. When he heard the two-blast signal of the Fort Willdoc it is true he understood it to be an answer to his own two-blast signal and he understood, he says, the meaning of it according to the rules, but that is a very different thing from an admission that he was a party to an agreement that he would conform to the course indicated by that signal. Apparently he was not. During the delay between the first inconsistent signals and the two-blast signal of the Fort Willdoc conditions had so altered that it was impossible for the captain of the New York News to conform to the course suggested by the Fort Willdoc's signal, if he had desired to do so. All this would follow in the natural and ordinary course from the Fort Willdoc's one-blast signal and her delay in giving her two-blast signal, as the master of the Fort Willdoc might have realized. The learned President of the Exchequer Court of Canada says:\u2014\nThe one blast of the Fort Willdoc meant to the New York News that the Fort Willdoc was starboarding and would likely cross the bow of the New York News, and the delay of forty seconds, nearly three-quarters of a minute, in assenting to the passing signal of the New York News was obviously calculated to confuse and embarrass the New York News, because in the meanwhile it would be natural for her to assume that the Fort Willdoc was crossing to starboard. Even the first mate of the Fort Willdoc appears to have thought that the pause of forty seconds was excessive.\n****\nOn hearing the one blast of the Fort Willdoc the New York News went full speed astern on her engines for a time, and her stem would therefore have a tendency to back to port thus throwing her bow to starboard, while stopping her headway. Up to this time the New York News could not have been proceeding at more than about three knots. The New York News had assumed for forty seconds that the Fort Willdoc intended to cross her port bow and she went astern at full speed, to stop her headway and to swing her head to starboard, and my assessor advises me this was good seamanship, and, I think, that must be so. Then, after a delay of more than half a minute, the New York News heard her own two-blast signal answered but it was then too late for her to get her head back to port sufficiently to clear the bow of the Fort Willdoc. It may be granted that the New York News had heard and understood the Fort Willdoc's two-blast signal but it must be remembered that by this time the New York News was going full speed astern on her engines and her bow would be beginning to swing to starboard. My assessor tells me that it would take a little time for a loaded ship to steady by her head and recover herself from a natural swing to starboard caused by her engines going full speed astern\u201d, and before this recovery to port could happen the Fort Willdoc appeared close to the port bow of the New York News, and to me that seems just what happened.\nI agree with the learned President of the Exchequer Court of Canada that the New York News was in fault in not giving the danger signal instantly on hearing the single-blast signal from the Fort Willdoc. But on the other hand, it was the duty of the captain of the Fort Willdoc, as the learned President of the Exchequer Court of Canada has pointed out, under Rules 21 and 22, to give the danger signal and go astern on his engines, as the New York News did. I agree with the learned President of the Exchequer Court of Canada that the delay of a period of between one-half a minute and three-quarters of a minute was a considerable delay in the conditions of the moment; and that it is impossible to say that this signal was given \"immediately\" after the signal of the New York News, or \"promptly\", within the meaning of Rule 25.\nI find myself in some difficulty in accepting the evidence on behalf of the Fort Willdoc that she ran about three minutes hard aport after her two-blast signal. During that period she altered her course to port not more, at all events, than twenty-two degrees, as the learned trial judge found. The assessor of the learned President advised him that this is hardly believable and I do not think the evidence of the Fort Willdoc on this point is satisfactory. I agree, moreover, with the conclusions expressed in the following passage:\u2014\nThe conclusions I have reached are the following: Both ships were violating Rule 19 in proceeding at full speed in a dense fog. Both ships also violated Rule 19 in not immediately reducing speed to bare steerage way on hearing the fog signal of another vessel less than four points from right ahead, and navigating with caution until they had passed each other; in such a state of facts it is no defence for one ship to say that the fog signals of the other appeared to be far away.\n***\nThere came a time when the New York News considered that the ships were not approaching each other head and head, or nearly so, but were sufficiently on the starboard of each other that she decided to give two blasts of her whistle, which meant a signal to pass starboard to starboard, and to this the Fort Willdoc expressed assent and signified her willingness and intention to direct her course to port, but the Fort Willdoc was at fault, as I have already stated, in not having promptly responded with her answered signal. Rule 21 requires every vessel receiving a signal from another to respond promptly with the same signal, or to sound the danger signal as provided in Rule 22. Rule 22 states that when ships are approaching each other and there is a failure on the part of either ship to understand the course or intention of the other, the one in doubt shall immediately signify the same by the prescribed danger signal, and both ships shall be immediately slowed to bare steerage way, and, if necessary, stopped and reversed until the proper signals are given, answered, and understood, or until the ships shall have passed each other.\nI agree with the learned President of the Exchequer Court of Canada that the final manoeuvre of the New York News was justified under Rule 37.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Rinfret, Hudson and Taschereau, JJ. was delivered by\nTaschereau, J.: The plaintiff-appellant, the Paterson Steamships Limited, is the owner of the ship Fort Willdoc, and the defendant-respondent owns the New York News. On the 11th of September, 1938, at 5.30 a.m., both ships were following their usual courses, nine miles west of Passage Island, near the head of Lake Superior, and came into collision, the stem of the Fort Willdoc hitting the port side of the New York News opposite her no. 1 hatch, with the result that both suffered severe damage.\nThe New York News which is a full canal type steel vessel with a gross tonnage of 2,310, was on a voyage from Port Arthur to Port Colborne and Montreal, loaded with a cargo of 122,000 bushels of wheat. The Fort Willdoc, a grain carrier, is a ship of 4,542 gross tonnage and was proceeding light to Port Arthur.\nThe local judge in Admiralty for the province of Quebec, Mr. Justice Lucien Cannon, sitting in Montreal and assisted by Victor Chartier, assessor, held that the New York News was responsible for the collision, maintained the action, brought by the Fort Willdoc, against the respondent, and dismissed the counter-claim. In the Exchequer Court of Canada[2], the learned President allowed the appeal to the extent of declaring that both vessels were equally at fault in bringing about the collision in question, and referred the matter to the Registrar of the Quebec Admiralty District to assess the damages. The owners of the Fort Willdoc now appeal to this Court and submit that the judgment of the learned trial judge should be restored.\nThe evidence reveals that at about 5.15 a.m., fifteen minutes before the collision, while the two ships were proceeding in a dense fog, both gave simultaneously passing signals, the New York News a two-blast signal, and the Fort Willdoc a one-blast signal. From forty to forty-five seconds \"after the sound had died down\", and the \"echo had gone\", Captain Baker, the master of the Fort Willdoc blew a two-blast signal, altered the course of his ship twenty-two degrees to port, and proceeded at a reduced speed to meet the on-coming New York News starboard to starboard.\nThe New York News had also slowed down to a speed barely sufficient for steerage way, and while both ships were giving fog signals, the Fort Willdoc suddenly heard a danger signal coming from the New York News. She immediately reversed her engine full speed astern, but could not avoid coming into contact with the New York News which was crossing her bow, and which now had her engine full speed ahead in order, as her Captain says in his evidence, \"to try and clear the other\".\nUnder the \"Rules of the Road for the Great Lakes\" (no. 25) it is the duty of each steamer approaching each other head and head to pass on the port side, and the pilot of either steamer may be first in determining to pursue this course and shall give as a signal of his intention one short and distinct blast of his whistle, which the pilot of the other steamer shall answer promptly by a similar blast of his whistle. But if the courses of the steamers are not head and head, but on the starboard of each other, the pilot so first deciding must immediately give two short and distinct blasts of his whistle, which the pilot of the other steamer must answer promptly by two blasts of his whistle, and then the two ships must pass on the starboard side of each other. If there is any misunderstanding, then, under Rule 22, the pilot in doubt must immediately signify his doubt by giving the danger signal of five or more short and rapid blasts of the whistle, and if both vessels have approached within half a mile of each other, they must immediately be slowed down to a speed barely sufficient for steerageway.\nBoth ships were not coming head and head, but were slightly on the starboard side of each other. The one-blast signal of the Fort Willdoc and the two-blast signal of the New York News were not cross signals, as they were given simultaneously and it is thus that Captain Ferguson of the New York News understood them. In his evidence, he says:\u2014\nA. No, there were no cross signals. They were both at the same time.\nIf at the moment of these simultaneous signals there has been any confusion, it was surely for a very short time, because immediately after the two-blast signal of the Fort Willdoc, her Captain ordered her twenty-two degrees to port in order to meet starboard to starboard. The Captain of the New York News heard this last signal and understood it as meaning that the ships would meet starboard to starboard according to Rule 25. He says in his evidence:\u2014 Q. Then, when the two-blast signal was given by the Fort Willdoc that was in answer to your first two-blast signal?\nA. I heard that.\nQ. And that was an answer, was it not?\nA. I presume it was.\nQ. Therefore, when he answered your two-blast signal with a two-blast signal, that would mean to you, under the rules, would it not, starboard to starboard?\nA. Starboard to starboard.\nQ. To pass starboard to starboard?\nA. Yes.\nIf it has been otherwise, it was his duty to give immediately the danger signal which he did not give. To my mind, there was a perfect understanding by both ships as to how they would meet, and I am in complete agreement with the learned trial judge when he says, and finds as a fact:\u2014\nThis second two-blast signal from the Fort Willdoc was clearly heard and well understood by the New York News; there was no cross signal or any misunderstanding between the two ships at the time. The Captain of the New York News and the members of the crew definitely admitted this fact.\nIt is true that later a danger signal was given by the New York News three or four minutes after the last signal had been given by the Fort Willdoc, but it was then too late, and at a moment when the collision was unavoidable.\nIt seems clear that if the understanding which has been proven and admitted by the Captain of the New York News had been followed, there would have been no collision, both ships meeting starboard to starboard. The sole and determining cause of the accident was the failure of the New York News to follow the course agreed upon, and to proceed, without giving the necessary signals, in a direction unknown to the Fort Willdoc and which she had no reason to foresee.\nAs pointed out by the trial judge, the New York News did not follow the \"Rules of the Road of the Great Lakes\" nor did she steer the course agreed upon with the Fort Willdoc. There was ample evidence to justify the findings of the learned trial judge, who did not act on any wrong ground of law or conclusion of fact.\nThe respondent contends that before the accident the Fort Willdoc was proceeding at an excessive rate of speed, and thus contributed to the accident. If so, this would be before 5.15 a.m. when the first blasts of the whistles were heard. I can see no possible relation between this previous speed and the collision, and I believe that it can have no bearing whatever upon the issue of liability in the present case. As it was said in the case of The Pemaquid[3],\nA steamer which before she came on sight, in a fog, of a meeting vessel, which she knew was approaching, had stopped and reversed, and was actually going astern at the time of collision, cannot be held in fault because of her previous speed.\nI come to the conclusion that the New York News is the only party to blame and that she is responsible for this accident. I would allow the appeal, maintain the action of the Fort Willdoc, dismiss the counter-claim and restore the judgment of the local judge in Admiralty with costs throughout.\nCrocket J. (dissenting).\u2014I agree with the learned President of the Exchequer Court of Canada and would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Montgomery, McMichael, Common & Howard.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Beauregard, Laurence & Brisset.\n[1] [1941] Ex.

Act, ss. 91, 92.\nThe Debt Adjustment Act, 1937, Statutes of Alberta, 1937, c. 9 (as amended in 1937 (3rd session), c. 2; 1938, c. 27; 1938 (2nd session), c. 5; 1939, c. 81; and 1941, c. 42), is ultra vires in whole. Its effect is to take away from all creditors who are the owners of debts or liquidated demands that, apart from the Act, would be presently enforceable by law, their rights in respect of their enforceability by action or suit, and to substitute for such rights the chance of obtaining, by the arbitrary determination of a public authority, the Debt Adjustment Board (the appeal given therefrom is merely one from the arbitrary determination of one authority to the arbitrary determination of another), permission to enforce them. Such an enactment is something more than one relating to procedure; it strikes at the substance of the creditor's rights. The Act is repugnant to the provisions of Dominion statutes (instances mentioned) relating to matters within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament, provisions creating or directly giving rise to or recognizing obligations in the nature of debts or liquidated demands. To establish any such authority, with its powers of selection, involving a considerable power of regulation of classes of business and undertakings over which the B.N.A. Act gives to the Parliament of Canada exclusive control, is incompetent to the provincial legislature.\nThe prohibitory provisions of the Act in question against proceedings by way of execution, etc., without the Board's permit, is ultra vires by reason of considerations of much the same character as those aforesaid. The Board is authorized to refuse a permit in any particular case. The pith and substance of the legislation is to establish, a provincial authority empowered to exercise a discriminatory control. While in form it is legislation in relation to remedy and procedure, yet, in attempting to regulate the remedial incidents of the right in manner aforesaid, it must, when read in light of its context in the Act, in substance be regarded as a step in a design to regulate the right itself.\nAs to companies incorporated by the Dominion, companies with objects other than provincial objects, in relation to the incorporation, status and powers of which companies the Dominion Parliament has, under s. 91 of the B.N.A. Act, exclusive power to legislate:\u2014It is true that, where the business of the company is subject to provincial legislative regulation, the provincial legislature may legislate in such a manner as to affect the business of the company by laws of general application in relation to the kind of business in which the company engages in the province\u2014but the enactments now in question, authorizing interference with the affairs of creditors in manner aforesaid, are not a general law in this sense.\nThe matters dealt with by s. 26 of the Act are so related to the subject-matter of The Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act as to be withdrawn from provincial jurisdiction by force of the last paragraph of s. 91 of the B.N.A. Act.\nAlso the Act constitutes an attempt to invade the field reserved to the Dominion under Bankruptcy and Insolvency.\nAssuming that, by apt legislation strictly limited to enactments relating exclusively to matters within the legislative jurisdiction of a province, a Board might lawfully be constituted having some of the powers which the Debt Adjustment Board receives under the Act, yet, in any view of that question, it is impossible in the Act to disentangle what a provincial legislature might competently enact from the principal enactments of the Act constituting the Board with authority to exercise powers that the legislature is incompetent to confer upon it; and indeed, if this were possible and the Act could be re-written excluding what is ultra vires from what (on said assumption) might be intra vires, there can be no probability that the legislature would have enacted the Act in this truncated form. The competent elements of the legislation, if such there be, not being severable from the incompetent enactments constituting the Board with the powers conferred upon it, the Act is, as a whole, ultra vires.\nCrocket J. dissented, holding: The Act (as amended as aforesaid) is not ultra vires, in whole or in part, except in so far as its provisions may be found to conflict with any existing Dominion legislation strictly relating to any of the classes of subjects specially enumerated in s. 91 of the B.N.A. Act or as being necessarily incidental to the particular subject-matter upon which the Parliament of Canada has undertaken to legislate as falling within one or other of the said enumerated heads. The whole purpose of the Act in question is to regulate and control the enforcement of contractual obligations for the payment of money so as to safeguard during a period of financial stress the interests of unfortunate resident debtors who, owing entirely to general depreciation of values through abnormal economic conditions, find themselves in such a position that the stringent enforcement of creditors' claims might entail irreparable loss upon them. Its provisions are predominantly directed to procedure in civil matters in provincial courts. The right to sue in provincial courts is a civil right in the province, whether the claim sought to be enforced arose in the province or not. The Act is one of general application in the province, within the meaning of the authorities. None of its provisions are directed to insolvency legislation nor to banks or banking legislation, nor to the contracts of Dominion companies, carrying on business either within or without the province, though they may affect these subjects and these rights collaterally as a necessary incident to the attainment of the objects of the Act. While it was held in Attorney-General for Alberta and Winstanley v. Atlas Lumber Co. Ltd., [1941] S.C.R. 87, that s. 8 of the Act conflicted with certain Dominion legislation strictly and necessarily relating to head 18 of s. 91 of the B.N.A. Act (Bills of Exchange and Promissory Notes) and that the latter must prevail, it does not follow that the Act in question must be held to be wholly ultra vires merely because it affects or may affect Bankruptcy or Insolvency, Banks and Banking, Interest or any other subject enumerated in s. 91 upon which the Dominion Parliament has purported to legislate as falling within one or more of those classes of subjects. \"Bills of Exchange and Promissory Notes\" is the only class of contracts specifically mentioned in s. 91 of the B.N.A. Act, and this specific enumeration may well be said to expressly withdraw that class of contracts from the exclusive jurisdiction of the province in relation to s. 92 (13), \"Property and Civil Rights in the Province.\" (Citizens Insurance Co. v. Parsons, 7 App. Cas. 96; Attorney-General of Ontario v. Attorney-General for Canada, [1894] A.C. 189; Ladore v. Bennett, [1939] A.C. 468, and other cases, cited).\nREFERENCE by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, pursuant to the authority of s. 55 of the Supreme Court Act (R.S.C., 1927, c. 35), to the Supreme Court of Canada, of the following questions for hearing and consideration, namely: (1) Is The Debt Adjustment Act, 1937, being chapter 9 of the Statutes of Alberta, 1937, as amended by chapter 2 of the Statutes of Alberta, 1937 (3rd session), chapter 27. of the Statutes of Alberta, 1938, chapter 5 of the Statutes of Alberta, 1938 (2nd session), chapter 81 of the Statutes of Alberta, 1939, and chapter 42 of the Statutes of Alberta, 1941, ultra vires of the Legislature of Alberta, either in whole or in part, and if so, in what particular or particulars or to what extent?\n(2) Is the said Act as amended operative in respect of any action or suit for the recovery of moneys alleged to be owing under or in respect of any bill of exchange or promissory note?\n(3) Is the said Act as amended operative in respect of any proceedings taken to enforce any judgment obtained in any action or suit for the recovery of moneys owing under or in respect of any bill of exchange or promissory note?\n(4) Is the said Act as amended operative in respect of any action or suit for the recovery of money or interest thereon, or both, not being money or interest alleged to be owing under or in respect of any bill of exchange or promissory note, whether or not such money or interest is secured upon land situated in the said province, in the following cases, namely, where such action or suit is for the recovery of,\u2014\n(a) the principal amount of such money and interest, if any, where the same are payable in the said province;\n(b) the principal amount of such money and interest, if any, where the same are payable outside the said province;\n(c) the interest only upon such money.\n(5) If the answer to any of the parts (a), (b) and (c) of question 4 is in the negative, is the said Act as amended operative in respect of any proceedings taken to enforce any judgment obtained in any action or suit in respect of which such answer is given?\nThe respective Attorneys-General of the Provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec and Saskatchewan, and the Mortgage Loans Association of Alberta and the Canadian Bankers' Association were, pursuant to order of the Chief Justice of Canada, notified of the hearing of the Reference.\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. and F. P. Varcoe K.C. for the Attorney-General of Canada.\nW. N. Tilley K.C., T. D'Arcy Leonard K.C., and R. D. Tighe K.C. for The Mortgage Loans Association of Alberta.\nW.N. Tilley K.C., R. C. McMichael K.C. and W. H. McLaws K.C., for The Canadian Bankers' Association.\nJ. W. deB. Farris K.C., W. S. Gray K.C. and J. J. Frawley K.C., for the Attorney-General of Alberta. J. M. Stevenson K.C. for the Attorney-General of Saskatchewan.\nL. St-Laurent K.C. for the Attorney-General of Quebec.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Rinfret, Davis, Kerwin, Hudson and Taschereau JJ. was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice\u2014By section 8, subsection 1 (a), of the Debt Adjustment Act, a legal right which the owner of it is entitled to enforce is converted into a conditional right, enforceable only by grace of a permit from the Board granting to the owner of it a dispensation from the incidence of the general rule.\nThis authority of the Board may be considered with reference to debts arising by virtue of statutes, or legal rules, that the legislature is powerless to repeal or vary, as well as with reference to creditors whose powers and status it is incompetent to impair, or whose undertakings, or business, the legislature is incompetent to regulate.\nIt is most important, I think, not to lose sight of the arbitrary nature of the Board's authority. The powers of the Board, it will be noticed, may be exercised by any single member of the Board, or by any person designated by the Board, with the approval of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council. Ex hypothesi the debt or liquidated demand, which the Board has to consider on any application for a permit, may be one which, but for the statute, would admittedly be enforceable by law; and in discussing the operation of the enactment I shall assume that we are dealing with a debt, or demand, admittedly so enforceable.\nThe statute prescribes no rule, or principle, by which the Board, or its designated agent, is to be guided in granting, or refusing, a permit; nor does it give any clue to the considerations upon which the Board is to act. I do not think that any Court can, with any confidence, form a judgment as to the reasons by which the Board will be guided, except that the Board may be assumed to act in accordance with its own conception of its duty in each particular case. It is the duty of the Board, under section 10 of the Act, to make such enquiries as it may deem proper into the circumstances, but that section makes it clear. I think, that it is for the Board exclusively to decide what are the considerations by which it ought to be influenced in granting, or refusing, an application for a permit, or adjourning the application for such period as it \"may deem advisable under the circumstances.\" In effect the Board is empowered to exercise in each particular case an arbitrary determination. The appeal to a jury, given by the amending statute, on which it is to decide as a question of fact whether the determination of the Board is to stand, or is to be changed, merely gives an appeal from the arbitrary determination of one authority to the arbitrary determination of another. The consequence of all this is that all creditors who are the owners of debts, or liquidated demands, that, apart from the statute, would be presently enforceable by law, have their rights in respect of their enforceability by action, or suit, taken away, and for them they have substituted the possibility of obtaining from this authority permission to enforce them.\nThe distinction between right and remedy is often a useful distinction, but an enactment which takes away the remedy by action, which the law otherwise would give to the creditor in respect of his debt, and substitutes therefor the chance of obtaining, by the arbitrary act of a public authority, permission to enforce a remedy is, I think, something more than an enactment relating to procedure. It strikes, I think, at the substance of the creditor's rights. The enactment is repugnant to the provisions of Dominion statutes relating to matters within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament, provisions creating or directly giving rise to, or recognizing, obligations in the nature of debts and liquidated demands: for example, certain provisions of the Bills of Exchange Act, section 125 of the Bank Act, and provisions in respect of calls made by a Dominion company upon the holders of unpaid shares (see section 44, Companies Act). Such instances could be multiplied.\nThere is another class of cases that I have just alluded to, the consideration of which leaves it, I think, very clear that in attempting to establish an authority of this character a provincial legislature is exceeding its authority. Section 91 of the British North America Act gives to the Parliament of Canada exclusive control over certain types of business and undertakings. I particularly refer to two classes of business only. The first of these, that of banks, perhaps illustrates the point most strikingly. The lending of money is a principal part of the business of any bank. A debt arising from a loan by a bank to a customer will, speaking generally, fall within section 8.(1) (a), and the bank's right to enforce repayment is by the enactment conditioned upon the existence of a permit. It is in the power of the Board to refuse a permit in all such cases, or in the case of any particular debt. This power of selection seems to involve a considerable power of regulation of the business of the banks. It is, I think, incompetent to the legislature to establish any such authority. I think the case of banking is, perhaps, from this point of view, the most striking case, although the application of the authority of the Board to companies engaged in operating Dominion undertakings, such as Dominion railway companies and companies engaged in operating lines of ocean shipping, might well exceed the ambit of provincial authority.\nWhat I have said is sufficient, in my opinion, to show that subsection (1) (a) of section 8 is ultra vires. I assume that debts and liquidated demands falling entirely (that is to say, exclusively) under the regulative authority of the province, as being \"civil rights within the province\", could be dealt with by a province by an enactment having the characteristics of section 8(1) (a), but limited to such debts and demands. It is not necessary to decide it, but I assume that to be so. I do not think that section 8(1) (a) can properly be construed as limited in its application to such debts and demands and it is, therefore, I think, entirely destitute of effect.\nSubsection 1 (b) of section 8 presents a different question, but it is, in my opinion, ultra vires by reason of considerations of much the same character. It is no answer to say that the authority extends to all judgments; because the Board can arbitrarily refuse to grant a permit in any particular case. The Board is authorized to refuse a permit for a writ of execution where the debt sued upon is one which it has no power to regulate and to do so for any reason which to it may appear sufficient; and, of course, to discriminate in this respect between debts which it has power to regulate and debts in respect of which it has no such power.\nWe are not required to consider the authority of a provincial legislature to restrict the jurisdiction of the provincial Courts to giving declaratory judgments and to deprive them of the power to grant any consequential relief. This legislation affects the jurisdiction of the provincial Courts, but the pith and substance of it is to establish a provincial authority which is empowered to exercise the discriminatory control just mentioned. While in form this is legislation in relation to remedy and procedure, in substance this provision which attempts to regulate the remedial incidents of the right in this manner must, when it is read in light of the context in which it stands in this section 8 (1), be regarded as a step in a design to regulate the right itself.\nThere is a class of creditors occupying a special position which must be considered. I refer to companies incorporated by the Dominion. It is settled that in the case of companies with objects other than provincial objects, the exclusive power to legislate in relation to incorporation is vested in Parliament, and that by the joint operation of the residuary power under section 91 of the Confederation Act and the powers conferred upon Parliament in relation to the enumerated subject, the regulation of trade and commerce, this power extends to the status and powers of the company. True, where the business of the company is subject to provincial legislative regulation, the provincial legislature may legislate in such a manner as to affect the business of the company by laws of general application in relation to the kind of business in which the company engages in the province; but the provisions of this statute giving to the Board the authority to interfere with the affairs of creditors in the manner set forth in section 8 would not appear to be a general law in this sense.\nA company, for example, incorporated by the Dominion with authority to carry on the business of lending money upon various kinds of security in the province, may find itself in a position, under the operation of subsections 1 (a) and (b) of section 8, in which it and other Dominion companies are precluded from enforcing their securities in the usual way. In my view, such legislation is not competent and, accordingly, paragraphs (c), (d), (e) and (f) would appear to be incompetent, as well as paragraphs (a) and (b).\nAs regards interest, subsection (1) of section 8 is plainly repugnant to section 2 of the Interest Act. In truth, the scope of subsection (1) of section 8 is indicated by paragraph (g) thereof and by section 41 which withdraws from the operation of the Act debts owing to The Canadian Farm Loan Board or to The Soldiers' Settlement Board and proceedings for enforcing the payment of any such debts. I think we must conclude that subsection (1) must be treated as a whole, that is to say, that it is valid or invalid as a whole, and for the reasons I have given it is, I think, invalid. The provisions of subsection (3) limiting the application of section 8 in the manner there mentioned do not, it appears to me, affect the force of what has been said. The whole of section 8 is ultra vires.\nAs to section 26, the matters dealt with by this enactment, in my opinion, are so related to the subject-matter of The Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act as to be withdrawn from provincial jurisdiction by force of the last paragraph of section 91.\nThere remains the contention of the Attorney-General of Canada that the statute as a whole constitutes an attempt to legislate in relation to bankruptcy and insolvency. I have very carefully considered this contention and the first thing that strikes one is that the effect of section 8 (1) is, as regards debts where the creditor and debtor reside in the province and the contract has been made in the province and the debt is payable in the province, that the creditor is deprived of his right to present a bankruptcy petition. As appears from what has already been said, section 8 (1) does not merely suspend the remedy\u2014it takes away the remedy given by law and substitutes therefor a remedy dependent upon the arbitrary consent of the Board, or the arbitrary determination of a jury. As I have already said, this, in my opinion, strikes at the debt itself and I do not think that in any Court governed by this legislation it could be successfully contended that in respect of an obligation to which the statute applies there is a \"debt owing\" to the creditor, within the meaning of section 4 of the Bankruptcy Act. Moreover, I find it impossible to escape the conclusion that Part III contemplates the use of the Board's powers under section 8(1) to enable it to secure compulsorily the consent of the parties to arrangements proposed by it for composition and settlement. Bankruptcy is not mentioned, but normally the powers and duties of the Board under Part III will come into operation when a state of insolvency exists. It is not too much to say that it is for the purpose of dealing with the affairs of debtors who are pressed and unable to pay their debts as they fall due that these powers and duties are created. Indeed the whole statute is conceived as a means of protecting embarrassed debtors who are residents of Alberta. Most people would agree that in this point of view the motives prompting the legislation may be laudable ones. But the legislature, in seeking to attain its object, seems to have entered upon a field not open to it. The statute, if valid, enables the Board (invested with exclusive possession of the key to the Courts) to employ its position and powers coercively in compelling the creditors of an insolvent debtor and the debtor himself to consent to a disposition of the resources of the debtor prescribed by the Board. In this way the statute seeks to empower the Board to impose upon the insolvent debtor and his creditors a settlement of his affairs, which the creditors must accept in satisfaction of their claims. I cannot escape the conclusion that the statute contemplates the use of the powers of the Board in this way. I think this is an attempt to invade the field reserved to the Dominion under Bankruptcy and Insolvency.\nIt may be that by apt legislation strictly limited to enactments relating exclusively to matters within the legislative jurisdiction of a province, a Board might lawfully be constituted having some of the powers which the Debt Adjustment Board receives under this legislation. As already intimated, it is unnecessary to express any opinion upon that. In any view of that question, it is impossible in this legislation to disentangle what a provincial legislature might competently enact from the principal enactments of the statute constituting this Board with authority to exercise powers that the legislature is incompetent to confer upon it; and indeed, if this were possible and the Debt Adjustment Act could be re-written excluding what is ultra vires from what I assume might be intra vires, there can be no probability that the legislature would have enacted the statute in this truncated form. The competent elements of the legislation, if such there be, not being severable from the incompetent enactments constituting the Board with the powers conferred upon it, the statute is, as a whole, ultra vires.\nIt follows that the first interrogatory should be answered by stating that the enactment in question is ultra vires in whole. As regards the second, third, fourth and fifth interrogatories, it follows from the answer to the first that \"the said Act as amended\" is not operative in respect of any of the matters mentioned in those interrogatories.\nCrocket J. (dissenting)\u2014This reference raises the question of the authority of the Legislature of Alberta to enact legislation dealing with the matters to which the provisions of the Alberta Debt Adjustment Act are directed. The answers to the general question (1) and the other four subordinate questions submitted manifestly depend upon the scope and extent of the legislative powers committed to the Legislatures of the Provinces of Canada by s. 92 of the British North America Act, as read in the light of s. 91 and the intendment of the whole Act regarding the distribution of legislative authority between the Parliament of Canada on the one hand and the Provinces on the other.\nWe must, I think, take it as settled that provincial legislation upon matters, which prima facie fall within one or more of the 16 classes of subjects enumerated in s. 92 of the B.N.A. Act, cannot be validly superseded by any Dominion legislation of the Parliament of Canada unless the latter is necessarily incidental to the exercise of the powers conferred upon it by one or other of the 29 specially enumerated heads of s. 91, that is to say, as Lord Tomlin expressed it in Attorney-General for Canada v. Attorney-General for British Columbia[1], in his summing up of the effect of the decisions of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council regarding the interpretation and application of ss. 91 and 92, unless such legislation \"strictly relates to subjects of legislation expressly enumerated in s. 91\" or is \"necessarily incidental to effective legislation by the Parliament of the Dominion upon a subject of legislation expressly enumerated in s. 91\". See also Citizens Ins. Co. v. Parsons[2]; Cushing v. Dupuy[3]; Tennant v. Union Bank of Canada[4]; Attorney-General of Ontario v. Attorney-General for the Dominion of Canada[5], and City of Montreal v. Montreal Street Railway[6].\nAnother principle, which bears particularly on the construction of the words \"Property and Civil Rights in the Province\", as used in s. 92(13), was also distinctly laid down by the Judicial Committee in the Parsons case (1) at p. 109, viz., that the words \"Property and Civil Rights\" are there used in their largest sense, and are not limited to such rights only as flow from the law, e.g., the status of persons. There is \"no sufficient reason in the language itself\", said Sir Montague Smith in the judgment of the Board, \"nor in the other parts of the Act, for giving so narrow an interpretation to the words 'civil rights'.\" This, of course, as my Lord the Chief Justice pointed out in delivering the unanimous judgment of this Court on the Reference re the Natural Products Marketing Act[7], is subject to the limitations expressly arising from the exception of the enumerated heads of s. 91 and impliedly from the specification of subjects in s. 92. Sir Montague himself went on to say regarding the enumerated heads of s. 91:\nIn looking at s. 91, it will be found, not only that there is no class including, generally, contracts and the rights arising from them, but that one class of contracts is mentioned and enumerated, viz., \"18. Bills of Exchange and Promissory Notes\", which it would have been unnecessary to specify if authority over all contracts and the rights arising from them had belonged to the Dominion Parliament.\nPractically the same thing was said of the phrase \"Administration of Justice\", as used in 92 (14), by Street J., in delivering the judgment of himself and Falconbridge J., in Reg. v. Bush[8]. The words of paragraph 14 of s. 92, he said, confer upon the Provincial Legislatures the right to regulate and provide for the whole machinery connected with the administration of justice in the Provinces, including the appointment of all Judges and officers requisite for the proper administration of justice in its widest sense, reserving only the procedure in criminal matters,\nas reserved by 91 (27) and subject to the provisions of ss. 96-100 relating to the appointment and payment of judges of Superior, District and County Courts and the constitution of a General Court of Appeal for Canada under s. 101. This pronouncement was distinctly and unanimously approved by this Court in a judgment delivered by the learned Chief Justice. See [1938] S.C.R., at p. 406, on the Reference regarding the validity of the provisions of the Ontario Adoption, the Children's Protection and the Deserted Wives' and Children's Maintenance Acts vesting certain functions in County Court and District Court Judges, and in Police Magistrates and Juvenile Court Judges[9].\nThe case of Attorney-General of Ontario v. Attorney-General for the Dominion of Canada[10] seems to me to have a very special bearing upon the present case. It was cited along with Attorney-General for Ontario v. Attorney-General for the Dominion[11] by Lord Tomlin in delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Attorney-General for Canada v. Attorney-General for British Columbia[12], in support of the Board's statement that\nIt is within the competence of the Dominion Parliament to provide for matters which, though otherwise within the legislative competence of the Provincial Legislature, are necessarily incidental to effective legislation by the Parliament of the Dominion upon a subject of legislation expressly enumerated in s. 91.\nThe 1894 case[13] involved the validity of an enactment of the Ontario Legislature relating to voluntary assignments, which the Board stated postponed judgments and executions not completely executed by payment to an assignment for the benefit of creditors under the Act. \"Now there can be no doubt\", the Board said,\nthat the effect to be given to judgments and executions and the manner and extent to which they may be made available for the recovery of debts are prim\u00e2 facie within the legislative powers of the provincial parliament. Executions are a part of the machinery by which debts are recovered, and are subject to regulation by that parliament. A creditor has no inherent right to have his debt satisfied by means of a levy by the sheriff, or to any priority in respect of such levy. The execution is a mere creature of the law which may determine and regulate the rights' to which it gives rise.\nTheir Lordships held that the provisions in question, relating as they did to assignments purely voluntary, did not infringe on the exclusive legislative power conferred upon the Dominion Parliament. \"They would observe\", the Lord Chancellor (Herschell), who delivered the judgment, continued,\nthat a system of bankruptcy legislation may frequently require various ancillary provisions for the purpose of preventing the scheme of the Act from being defeated. It may be necessary for this purpose to deal with the effect of executions and other matters which would otherwise be within the legislative competence of the Provincial Legislature. Their Lordships do not doubt that it would be open to the Dominion Parliament to deal with such matters as part of a bankruptcy law, and the Provincial Legislature would doubtless be then precluded from interfering with this legislation inasmuch as such interference would affect the bankruptcy law of the Dominion Parliament. But it does not follow that such subjects, as might properly be treated as ancillary to such a law and therefore within the powers of the Dominion Parliament, are excluded from the legislative authority of the Provincial Legislature when there is no bankruptcy or insolvency legislation of the Dominion Parliament in existence.\nThe clear effect of this judgment, I think, is that legislation dealing with the effect of judgments and executions and the manner and extent to which they may be made available for the recovery of debts are prim\u00e2 facie within the exclusive legislative powers of the Provinces as coming within 92 (13) and 92 (14) and that such provincial legislation must be held valid unless it is found to be inconsistent with the provisions of some existing Dominion legislation enacted in relation to one or other of the classes of subjects specially enumerated in s. 91, and necessary for the purpose of effecting the object to which such legislation is directed.\nAt the time of this decision there was no Dominion bankruptcy or insolvency legislation in force, the Dominion Insolvent Act of 1875 having been previously wholly repealed.\nI should like to refer to another case, which the Judicial Committee considered in 1898, that of Attorney-General for the Dominion of Canada v. Attorneys-General for the Provinces of Ontario, Quebec and Nova Scotia[14], in which the Board heard an appeal from the judgment of this Court on a reference involving, inter alia, the validity of s. 4, Revised Statutes of Canada, c. 95, purporting to empower the grant of an exclusive right to fish in property belonging to the Provinces. It was held, affirming the judgment of this Court[15], that that enactment, so far as it purported to empower the grant of exclusive fishing rights over provincial property, was ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada. The clear ground of the decision was that the provision did not fall within the exclusive legislative jurisdiction of the Dominion under s. 91 (12). I quote the following passage from that judgment at p. 716:\nBut whilst in their Lordships' opinion all restrictions or limitations by which public rights of fishing are sought to be limited or controlled can be the subject of Dominion legislation only, it does not follow that the legislation of Provincial Legislatures is incompetent merely because it may have relation to fisheries. For example, provisions prescribing the mode in which a private fishery is to be conveyed or otherwise disposed of, and the rights of succession in respect of it, would be properly treated as falling under the heading \"Property and Civil Rights\" within s. 92, and not as in the class \"Fisheries\" within the meaning of s. 91. So, too, the terms and conditions upon which the fisheries which are the property of the province may be granted, leased, or otherwise disposed of, and the rights which consistently with any general regulations respecting fisheries enacted by the Dominion Parliament may be conferred therein, appear proper subjects for provincial legislation, either under class 5 of s. 92, \"The Management and Sale of Public Lands\" or under the class \"Property and Civil Rights\". Such legislation deals directly with property, its disposal, and the rights to be enjoyed in respect of it, and was not in their Lordships' opinion intended to be within the scope of the class \"Fisheries\" as that word is used in s. 91.\nAs late as 1939 another case came before the Judicial Committee, which clearly involved the application of the same principles, and in which the Board in a judgment delivered by Lord Atkin affirmed a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, holding that certain parts of the Ontario Municipal Board Act, 1932, and the Department of Municipal Affairs Act, 1935, were intra vires of the Provincial Legislature. This was the case of Ladore v. Bennett[16], which arose out of the financial difficulties of four adjoining municipalities in the Province of Ontario and their amalgamation under the provisions of c. 74 of the Provincial Act of 1935 into one municipality under the name of the Corporation of the City of Windsor. Under the provisions of this Act the existing municipal corporations were dissolved and a special body called the Windsor Finance Commission was constituted with the same rights, powers and duties as by the provisions of Part III of the Department of Municipal Affairs Act, 1935, were conferred upon that Department, and the provisions of Part III of the latter Act were to apply to the new city. By the provisions of Part III the Ontario Municipal Board, if satisfied inter alia that a municipality had failed to meet its debentures or interest when due owing to financial difficulties, was given power inter alia to order postponement of or variation in the terms, time and places for payment of the whole or any portion of the debenture debt and outstanding debentures and other indebtedness and interest thereon, and variation in the rates of interest. A scheme having been formulated by the Windsor Commission pursuant to its powers and approved by the Ontario Municipal Board for funding and refunding the debts of the amalgamated municipalities, under which former creditors of the old independent municipalities received debentures of the new city of equal nominal amount to those formerly held, but with the interest scaled down in various classes of debentures, the Windsor Finance Commission was abolished by an amending Act of 1936, and its duties transferred to the Department of Municipal Affairs for Ontario. The plaintiff's action prayed inter alia for a declaration that the provisions of the Ontario Municipal Board Act, 1932, and the Department of Municipal Affairs Act, 1935, and amendments thereto, under which the funding and refunding debt scheme was effected, were ultra vires of the Provincial Legislature. It was contended that they invaded the legislative jurisdiction of the Dominion as to (1) bankruptcy and insolvency; (2) interest; and (3) because they affected private rights outside the Province.\nOn account of their peculiar applicability to the attack which is made against the validity of the Alberta Debt Adjustment Act in the present case, I quote the following passages from Lord Atkin's reasons:\nIt appears to their Lordships that the Provincial legislation cannot be attacked on the ground that it encroaches on the exclusive legislative power of the Dominion in relation to this class of subject. Their Lordships cannot agree with the opinion of Henderson, J.A., that there is no evidence that these municipalities are insolvent. Insolvency is the inability to pay debts in the ordinary course as they become due; and there appears to be no doubt that this was the condition of these corporations. But it does not follow that because a municipality is insolvent the Provincial Legislature may not legislate to provide remedies for that condition of affairs. The Province has exclusive legislative power in relation to municipal institutions in the Province: s. 92 (8) of the British North America Act, 1867. Sovereign within its constitutional powers, the Province is charged with the local government of its inhabitants by means of municipal institutions.\n***\nEfficient local government could not be provided in similar circumstances unless the Province were armed with these very powers, and if for strictly Provincial purposes debts may be destroyed and new debts created, it is inevitable that debtors should be affected, whether the original creditors reside within or without the Province. They took for their debtor a corporation which at the will of the Province could lawfully be dissolved, and of its destruction they took the risk.\n***\nIt was suggested in argument that the impugned provisions should be declared invalid because they sought to do indirectly what could not be done directly\u2014namely, to facilitate repudiation by Provincial municipalities of obligations incurred outside the Province. It is unnecessary to repeat what has been said many times by the Courts in Canada and by the Board, that the Courts will be careful to detect and invalidate any actual violation of constitutional restrictions under pretence of keeping within the statutory field. A colourable device will not avail. But in the present case nothing has emerged even to suggest that the Legislature of Ontario at the respective dates had any purpose in view other than to legislate in times of difficulty in relation to the class of subject which was its special care\u2014namely, municipal institutions. For the reasons given the attack upon the Acts and scheme on the ground either that they infringe the Dominion's exclusive power relating to bankruptcy and insolvency, or that they deal with civil rights outside the Province, breaks down. The statutes are not directed to insolvency legislation; they pick out insolvency as one reason for dealing in a particuler way with unsuccessful institutions; and though they affect rights outside the Province they only so affect them collaterally, as a necessary incident to their lawful powers of good government within the Province.\nThe question of interest does not present difficulties. The above reasoning sufficiently disposes of the objection. If the Provincial Legislature can dissolve a municipal corporation and create a new one to take its place, it can invest the new corporation with such powers of incurring obligations as it pleases, and incidentally may define the amount of interest which such obligations may bear. Such legislation, if directed bona fide to the effective creation and control of municipal institutions, is in no way an encroachment upon the general exclusive power of the Dominion Legislature over interest.\nI should not have felt it necessary to deal with the foregoing cases at such length had it not been for the contention that the recent decision of this Court in Attorney-General for Alberta and Winstanley v. Atlas Lumber Co. Ltd.[17] is necessarily conclusive of the invalidity of the impugned enactment, not only with regard to actions on bills of exchange and promissory notes, but with regard to all matters which affect or may affect bankruptcy or insolvency, banks and banking, interest and all other subjects specially enumerated in s. 91. For my part, I cannot accept this contention. The Court there dealt only with an action on a promissory note and held in effect that the plaintiff was entitled to bring his action for the recovery of the moneys due thereon in consequence of the provisions of ss. 74, 134, 135 and 136 of the Bills of Exchange Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 16, without the necessity of obtaining a permit enabling it to do so under the provisions of s. 8 of the provincial Debt Adjustment Act. The provisions of the impugned section of the provincial statute were held to conflict with these sections of the Dominion enactment as the Court construed the latter. While it was clearly enough laid down in the reasons for judgment that the impugned enactment of the provincial statute conflicted with existing Dominion legislation strictly and necessarily relating to enumerated head 18 of s. 91 and that the latter must for that reason prevail, it does not follow, I most respectfully think, that the provincial Debt Adjustment Act must be held to be wholly ultra vires of the Provincial Legislature merely because it affects or may affect bankruptcy or insolvency, banks and banking, interest or any other subject enumerated in s. 91, upon which the Dominion Parliament has purported to legislate as falling within one or more of those classes of subjects. As pointed out by Sir Montague Smith in the extract I have above quoted from his judgment in the Parsons case[18], \"Bills of Exchange and Promissory Notes\" is the only class of contracts which is specifically mentioned in s. 91, and there is no class (of subject) which includes \"generally contracts and the rights arising from them\". It would seem, therefore, that this specific enumeration of Bills of Exchange and Promissory Notes may well be said to expressly withdraw that class of contracts from the exclusive jurisdiction of the Province in relation to 92 (13), Property and Civil Rights.\nHaving regard, therefore, to the decisions and pronouncements of the Judicial Committee in the cases above referred to, which,\u2014to borrow the language of my Lord the Chief Justice, in delivering the unanimous judgment of this Court in the Natural Products case[19], had their basis\nis the consideration mentioned in Parsons case[20] arising from the specification of particular subjects in section 91 and from the necessity to limit the natural scope of the words \"in order to preserve from serious curtailment, if not from virtual extinction, the degree of autonomy, which, as appears from the scheme of the Act as a whole, the provinces were intended to enjoy\",\n\u2014as he put it in the Lawson case[21],\u2014I am constrained to differ from my brethren in the view that the provincial Debt Adjustment Act is wholly ultra vires for the reasons now given.\nThe whole purpose of the statute, as it plainly appears to me from an examination of all its provisions, is to regulate and control the enforcement of contractual obligations for the payment of money so as to safeguard during a period of financial stress the interests of unfortunate resident debtors, who, through no fault of their own, but entirely owing to the general depreciation of values brought about by abnormal economic conditions, find themselves in such a position that the stringent enforcement of their creditors' claims might entail irreparable loss upon them. Its provisions are predominantly directed to procedure in civil matters in provincial courts, in relation to the constitution and organization of which courts the provinces, within the limits already indicated, unquestionably possess sovereign legislative power, as each province does, in relation to property and civil rights within its territorial jurisdiction. It is not doubted that the right to sue in provincial courts is a civil right in the province, whether the claim sought to be enforced arose in the province or not. None of the provisions of the provincial statute are directed to insolvency legislation nor to banks or banking legislation, nor to the contracts of Dominion companies, carrying on business either within or without the province, though they may affect these subjects and these rights collaterally as a necessary incident to the attainment of the obvious object of the statute, viz., the granting of relief to hard pressed resident debtors. How, then, can it be said that the impugned statute is entirely beyond the constitutional competency of the province because it provides that no action for the recovery of money in respect of a liquidated demand or debt shall be commenced or continued, and no proceedings by way of execution, attachment, etc., taken, and no warrant of distress, chattel mortgage, conditional sale agreement or power of sale contained in a mortgage on land enforced against a resident debtor unless the Debt Adjustment Board issues a permit giving consent thereto?\nThis Court has quite recently applied the principle that Dominion and foreign corporations doing business in a province are subject to laws of general application in the province in matters falling within the classes of subjects enumerated in s. 92, notwithstanding these corporations may incidentally be affected in their business by some of the provisions of such provincial legislation. See Royal Bank of Canada v. Workman's Compensation Board of Nova Scotia[22]; and Home Oil Distributors Ltd. v. Attorney-General of British Columbia[23]. That this had previously been taken for granted would appear from the following passage, which I reproduce from the judgment of Duff, J., as our present Chief Justice then was, in Lukey v. Ruthenian Farmers' Elevator Co. Ltd.[24], cited by counsel for the Mortgage Loans Association of Alberta and the Canadian Bankers' Association, at pp. 71 and 72 as to the legislative power in relation to rights of Dominion corporations, the constitution of which is, of course, outside the purview of s. 92:\nAuthority of the Dominion under the residuary clause fortified by that under 91 (2) embraces authority to provide for the constitution of companies falling within the class of joint stock companies * * * possessing independently of provincial legislation in each of the provinces the status of a juridical person, having the right to contract, and having the right to invoke the jurisdiction of the courts, subject always, of course, to the measures passed by provincial legislatures of general application in relation to such civil rights. It is contended, however, that the impugned statute, by authorizing the Debt Adjustment Board to grant or refuse permits, gives it the unreasonable and arbitrary power to deny a creditor all access to the established courts of the Province. Whether the Board is given power arbitrarily and without investigation of the conditions and circumstances in any particular case or not does not, in my opinion, affect the constitutionality of the enactment. That has been laid down in so many cases as to admit of no doubt. It is emphasized particularly by Lord Herschell in his judgment in the 1898 case[25] at p. 713, and is strikingly illustrated by some of the passages I have quoted from Lord Atkin's judgment in Ladore v. Bennett[26]. That consideration may possibly bear on the question as to whether the provincial enactment is a mere colourable device or mere pretence, by which the Legislature has sought to do indirectly what it could not do directly. Many attacks have been made against Dominion as well as Provincial legislation on this ground, and some of them have succeeded. Once, however, it becomes clear from an examination of the provisions of an enactment that it is within the constitutional competency of the enacting Legislature, the courts have no concern as to the reasonableness or injustice of those provisions. If an enactment is of such a palpably unfair character as to offend the public conscience, the remedy lies, not with the courts of the country, but with the people to whom the Legislature is responsible, or in the power of disallowance, the responsibility for the exercise of which the B.N.A. Act has placed in the hands of the Governor in Council. I may add that a study of the whole Act has convinced me that it was not the intention of the Legislature that the Debt Adjustment Board should exercise the powers committed to it without any investigation or consideration of the facts and circumstances in any case coming before it, and that I cannot agree with the suggestion that the appeal for which the Act provides was intended to be an appeal merely to a jury of laymen. The appeal is in point of fact to a judge of the Supreme Court sitting with a jury, which can only determine the issue under proper instructions from the judge. See ss. 3 (d) and ss. 6, 9, 10, 21, 23, 33 and 36 (1), (3), (4), (5), (7), (8) and (10).\nAs to the suggestion that the Act was a colourable device to reach out at something which was beyond the competence of the Legislature, I need only refer, I think, to s. 39, which distinctly provides that the Act \"shall not be so construed as to authorize the doing of any act or thing which is not within the legislative competence of the Legislative Assembly\".\nI differ also from my brethren in their conclusion that the Debt Adjustment Act is not an Act of general application in the Province of Alberta within the meaning of the authorities.\nThe impossibility of answering the first question in the terms in which it is framed with any degree of definiteness or assurance must, I think, be apparent when the settled principles as to the scope and extent of the legislative power of the provinces under the B.N.A. Act are borne in mind.\nThis question, in the form in which it is put, manifestly involves, not only the construction of every one of the numerous provisions of the Debt Adjustment Act itself, but a search for any Dominion enactments which may possibly be affected thereby, as well as the consideration in connection with each one of these latter enactments whether they strictly relate to the particular matters upon which the Dominion has purported to legislate, or are merely ancillary thereto. To adapt the language of Lord Watson in delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Attorney-General for Ontario v. Attorney-General for the Dominion[27], if I may presume to do so, the question, being in its nature academic rather than judicial, is \"better fitted for the consideration of the officers of the Crown than of a court of law\".\nFor these reasons, I can only answer question 1 as follows: No, except in so far as its provisions may be found to conflict with any existing Dominion legislation strictly relating to any of the classes of subjects specially enumerated in s. 91 of the B.N.A. Act or as being necessarily incidental to the particular subject matter, upon which the Parliament of Canada has undertaken to legislate as falling within one or other of the said enumerated heads. As the other four questions involve the same considerations as have prompted me to incorporate in my answer to question 1 the exception there indicated, I am unable to answer the other four questions without a similar qualification.\nI therefore certify the foregoing as my opinion upon the questions submitted.\nThe opinions in respect of the questions referred to the Court were certified to His Excellency the Governor General in Council as follows:\u2014\nBy the Court:\u2014\nIn answer to the interrogatory numbered 1: The said Act as amended is ultra vires of the legislature of Alberta in whole.\nIn answer to the interrogatory numbered 2: The said Act as amended is not operative in respect of any of the matters mentioned.\nIn answer to the interrogatory numbered 3: The said Act as amended is not operative in respect of any of the matters mentioned.\nIn answer to the interrogatory numbered 4: The said Act as amended is not operative in respect of any of the matters mentioned.\nIn answer to the interrogatory numbered 5: The said Act as amended is not operative in respect of any of the matters mentioned.\nBy Mr. Justice Crocket:\u2014\nIn answer to question 1: No, except in so far as its provisions may be found to conflict with any existing Dominion legislation strictly relating to any of the classes of subjects specially enumerated in s. 91 of the B.N.A. Act or as being necessarily incidental to the particular subject matter, upon which the Parliament of Canada has undertaken to legislate as falling within one or other of the said enumerated heads.\nIn answer to the other four questions: As the other four questions involve the same considerations as have prompted me to incorporate in my answer to question 1 the exception there indicated, I am unable to answer the other four questions without a similar qualification.\n[1] [1930] A.C. 111.\n[2] (1881) 7 App. Cas. 96.\n[3] (1880) 5 App. Cas. 409, at 415.\n[4] [1894] A.C. 31.\n[5] [1894] A.C. 189.\n[6] [1912] A.C. 333.\n[7] [1936] S.C.R. 398, at 416.\n[8] (1888) 15 Ont.

His will made bequests of specific sums, directed a certain fund to be set aside for certain life interests and afterwards to revert to his estate, and bequeathed the whole of the residue to a university in the province of New Brunswick. The will provided that no bequests (except income from said fund) be paid for three years after deceased's death, the expressed purpose being to allow the executors time to dispose of securities to the best advantage and not in a depressed market. The will contained no express instructions with regard to payment of succession duties.\nShortly after the executors entered upon their duties and before they had realized any portion of the estate the stock market took an unprecedented and severe slump and the value of securities constituting the estate fell very much below the inventory values, with the result that the estate has ever since been insufficient to pay the legacies in full; all the general legacies had to abate and there was no residue. Between 1930 and 1936 the executors paid (from time to time as funds were available or were rendered available by sale of assets or by borrowings) to the Provinces of Nova Scotia, Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia the succession duties claimed to foe payable in respect of all property passing under deceased's will. The payments were made on the footing that the amounts thereof constituted a charge upon the assets of the estate and that the executors were legally bound to pay them. The duties were paid on the basis of the net value of the estate as at the time of deceased's death and at the rates appropriate to the different classes of beneficiaries, including the residuary legatee, as named in the will.\nThe Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco held (15 M.P.R. 477) that the executors were not entitled to pay succession duties as so claimed; that they were entitled to pay succession duties based upon the rates applicable to the persons who receive property or beneficial interest in property from the estate and not at rates applicable to persons by whom no property or beneficial interest in property is received although such latter persons may have been named in the will.\nThe sole surviving executor appealed to this Court.\nHeld (per the Chief Justice and Hudson and Taschereau JJ.; Crocket and Kerwin JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed. The executors were justified in having paid out of the assets of the estate the claims as made for succession duties.\nThe material statutory provisions considered were in the Nova Scotia Succession Duty Act (R.S.N.S., 1923, c. 18), the material statutory provisions in other provinces to whom duty was paid being substantially the same.\nPer Hudson and Taschereau JJ.: The tax is primarily a property tax and is intended to be a direct burden on that property, varying in amount according to the relationship of the successor to the testator. The tax is intended to be determined by the state of things existing at the date of the deceased's death. Agreement expressed with the following holding by Hall J., dissenting, in the Court below: It is the purpose and intention of the Act that the two factors necessary to determine the duty\u2014valuation and rates\u2014shall be constant. Irrespective of market fluctuations, duty shall be levied upon the fair market value (less deductions) at the date of death. The rate is determined by the relationship or nature of the person for whose benefit property passed on the death. Computation is made by applying the appropriate rate to property passing to each person beneficially on the testator's death. The duty is paid on the basis of the distribution intended by the testator. The executor deducts the amount which was payable on each legacy under s. 10 (1) of the Act. He must do this in order to carry on the administration of the estate. He cannot discharge his functions as executor until he has freed the assets of the estates from the lien imposed for succession duties.\nPer Crocket J. (dissenting): Property which \"passes on the death of any person\", within the meaning of the Act, means property which changes hands at the death; it vests in the executor, though he has no beneficial interest in it; it only actually \"passes\" to the beneficiary when it reaches him. It would be unreasonable and unjust to levy duty in respect of property that the beneficiary never received; and it should only be levied if the Act in the clearest terms directed it. S. 10 (1) of the Act cannot possibly be construed as imposing any liability upon the beneficiary for succession duties upon any property which he has not received. In view of the facts of this case, the executors were not justified in paying out of the assets of the estate the succession duties they did, and which included an amount in respect of the residuary gift, which they fully realized, at the time of payment of duties, was of no value.\nPer Kerwin J. (dissenting): The tax is imposed in respect of property \"passing on the death.\" The executor is not liable for the payment of it, though he is required (and is under penalty for failure) to deduct the duty before transferring to a legatee, etc., any property to which such person is entitled. Apart from this, the only one liable is the person to or for whose benefit any property passes, under s. 10(1). It must be borne in mind that the Court is here dealing with general legacies of specific amounts, except, of course, the residuary bequest. The residuary legatee actually received nothing. It cannot be held that any legatee who actually received nothing, though the will mentioned a bequest of a large sum to him, should pay a tax. In the present case the executors acted unreasonably, particularly as they knew when they paid a great portion of the duties that the assets would not be nearly sufficient to pay all the legacies.\nAPPEAL by the sole surviving executor and trustee under the last will and testament of Henry Marshall Jost, late of Guysboro in the province of Nova Scotia, deceased, from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco[1] dismissing (subject to a certain proviso) the appeal of the executors and trustees under said will from part of the judgment of Carroll J.[2].\nThe question on the present appeal was whether the executors, who had paid amounts claimed by certain Provinces of Canada for succession duties, were justified in having paid those amounts, or whether the duties had been paid upon a wrong basis of computation under the circumstances and consequently there had been overpayment for which the executors were chargeable.\nFor the purposes only of the appeal asserted from the judgment of Carroll J., the following facts were agreed upon:\u2014\n1. Henry Marshall Jost, the Testator, died August 25th, 1929, leaving a gross estate valued as at the date of death at $904,297.12 less known liabilities of $112,007.38, leaving a net value of $792,289.74. This estate consisted almost entirely of listed stocks and shares.\n2. Probate of the: Will was granted in due course to the Executors named therein, viz., The Eastern Trust Company, J. A. Fulton and George R. Hart (now deceased).\n3. The Testator by his Will made bequests of specific amounts aggregating $482,150., In addition he directed that $150,000 be set aside in Government Bonds and the income therefrom paid to John J. Gaetz for life and that on the death of Gaetz the fund of $150,000 should fall into and become part of the residue of his estate: provided however, that if Gaetz's wife should survive him (which she did) she was to be paid $1,200 yearly for life.\nBy the Will the whole of the residue was bequeathed to the Regents of Mount Allison University.\n4. Clause 79 of the Will reads as follows:\n\"It is my Will that no bequests be paid for three years after my demise except the half yearly income to my nephew John J. Gaetz or to his wife in the event of her surviving him. This provision is to allow the Executors time to dispose of my securities to the best advantage and not in a depressed market\".\n5. Shortly after the Executors entered upon their duties and before they had realized any portion of the estate, the stock market took an unprecedented and severe slump and the value of the securities constituting the estate fell very much below the inventory values with the Tesult that the estate has ever since been insufficient to pay the legacies in full. All the general legacies will have to abate and there will be no residue to go to the Regents of Mount Allison.\n6. Between the years 1930 and 1936 the Executors paid the following amounts in succession duties, which amounts included interest, viz:\u2014\nTo the Province of Ontario\n$ 77,031.50\nTo the Province of Quebec\n22,928.86\nTo the Province of British Columbia\n2,293.31\nTo the Province of Nova Scotia\n62,798.73\n$165,052.40\n7. The payment of these duties was made from time to time as funds were available or were rendered available by the sale of assets or by borrowings.\n8. The succession duties thus paid are all the succession duties in the four named Provinces claimed to be payable in respect of all property passing under the Will of the Testator. No attempt was made prior to or at the time of payment to break down these duties and allocate them to the various legatees, nor were the legatees ever called upon to pay to the Executors the amount of succession duties claimed to be payable in respect of their respective legacies, but the amounts claimed as duties were paid by the Executors on the footing that they constituted a charge upon the assets of the estate and that they were legally bound to pay them.\nIncluded in the bulk sums paid are succession duties claimed in respect of the residuary legacy which would have passed to Mount Allison University had it been possible to realize the assets at inventory price as at the death of the Testator.\n9. On a rough break-down it is estimated that had the assets proved sufficient to pay all the legacies in full including the residuary gift to Mount Allison, the amount of succession duty in all four Provinces attributable to the property thus passing to Mount Allison would be approximately $79,271.17.\n10. Succession Duty Returns were filed by the Executors with the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec in November, 1929, with the Province of Nova Scotia in September, 1931, and with the Province of British Columbia late in 1932 or early in 1933, and Statements of duty claimed were received by the Executors from the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec prior to the expiration of one year from the date of Testator's death.\n11. The succession duties claimed by the Province of Ontario were paid in March, 1931, as to the amount of $74,876.49; and the balance, being payments in respect of the Gaetz legacy, was paid out of general income in the years 1932 and 1933.\n12. The succession duties claimed by the Province of Quebec were paid as to $1,000 in 1930, and as to the balance in 1933.\n13. The succession duties claimed by the Province of Nova Scotia were paid in the years 1935 and 1936.\n14. The succession duties claimed by the Province of British Columbia were paid in the year 1934.\n15. The Will of the Deceased contained no express instructions with regard to the payment of succession duties.\n16. On March 11th, 1932, the Executors took out an Originating Summons for the determination of certain matters arising in connection with the Estate, and on August 3rd, 1932, His Lordship Mr. Justice Carroll by whom the motion had been heard granted an Order determining certain questions and directing that the determination of the remaining questions be deferred. Copies of the said Originating Summons and Order will be printed as part of the Case on Appeal.\n17. By Order dated April 26th, 1938, and made by His Lordship Mr. Justice Carroll the hearing of the undetermined matters raised by the said Originating Summons was set for May 20th, 1938; and on July 29th, 1938, it was ordered that a Reference be held before Charles F. Tremaine, Esq., K.C., Special Referee. Copy of the Order for Reference will be printed as part of the Case on Appeal.\n18. The hearing of the said Reference was proceeded with before Charles F. Tremaine, Esq., K.C., Special Referee, who on April 11th, 1939, filed an Interim Report, a copy of which will be printed as part of the Case on Appeal.\n19. A hearing of the matters raised by the Interim Report was had before Mr. Justice Carroll in the presence of Counsel for all parties interested, and on or about the 13th day of March, 1940, he delivered his Decision on the various points at issue.\n20. An Order for Judgment based on this Decision was granted on the 1st day of April, 1940.\n21. The present appeal is from a portion of the said Decision and portion of the said Order for Judgment. The said Decision, Order for Judgment and Notice of Appeal therefrom will be printed as part of the Case on Appeal.\n22. On the hearing before the said Referee, as well as upon the hearing before Mr. Justice Carroll it was agreed that it would not be necessary to prove the law of the Provinces of Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia as matters of fact, but that the said Referee and the said learned Judge might have resort to the Statutes of the said Provinces for the purpose of determining the law of such Provinces respectively with regard to succession duties.\nThe appeal from the judgment of Carroll J. was in respect of his decision upon the question of payment of succession duties. In the formal order for judgment of Carroll J. the question was stated and answered as follows:\n(4) Q. Were the Executors entitled to pay out of the assets of the estate to the Provinces of Nova Scotia, Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia the succession duties claimed by the said Provinces respectively in respect of property passing to the various legatees named in the Will or chargeable to such legatees respectively? A. No.\n(A copy of the order was to be served on the referee aforesaid and it was ordered that he complete his enquiry into the accounts and report.)\nIn their notice of appeal from the judgment of Carroll J., the executors stated:\nPart only of the said Decision and Order for Judgment are hereby appealed from, namely, such part or parts of the said Decision and Order for Judgment as hold or determine:\n(a) That the Executors were not entitled to pay out of the assets of the Estate to the Provinces of Nova Scotia, Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia the succession duties claimed by the said Provinces respectively in respect of property passing to the various legatees named in the Will or chargeable to such legatees respectively; and\/or\n(b) That there has been overpayment of succession duties by the Executors or any breach of trust or other improper conduct by the Executors in connection with the payment of succession duties; and\/or\n(c) That the Executors are in any way responsible for any overpayment of succession duties.\nThe appeal to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco was dismissed (subject to a proviso) per Graham, Doull and Archibald JJ.; Hall J. dissenting. The formal order dismissing the appeal ordered:\nThat the appeal in regard to (a), (b) and (c) set out in the notice of appeal be dismissed subject to this proviso that the answer of the trial judge to question 4 as set out in the order for judgment be varied to read as follows:\n\"No. The executors are entitled to pay succession duties based upon the rates applicable to the persons who receive property or beneficial interest in property from the estate of the deceased and not at rates applicable to persons by whom no property or beneficial interest in property is received although such latter persons may have been named in the will\".\nand further ordered that a copy of the order, of the judgments delivered on the appeal, and of the order appealed from, be served on the Referee aforesaid, and that he complete his inquiry into the accounts and report; and that the Referee\nin reporting upon the amount of succession duties payable in respect of property passing to the various legatees named in the Will or chargeable to such legatees respectively, shall make his finding thereon upon the basis of the judgments of the Honourable Mr. Justice Graham and the Honourable Mr. Justice Doull (as concurred in by the Honourable Mr. Justice Archibald) delivered herein on this appeal.\nThe present appeal was then brought to this Court. The appellant in its factum submitted\n1. That the majority in the Court in banco erred in holding that the rate at which succession duties were calculated depended upon the relationship to the Testator of the persons who actually received the proceeds of the Estate on distribution rather than on the relationship of those who would have received such proceeds had the Estate realized inventory value and been distributed according to the directions contained in the Will.\n2. That the majority in the Court in banco erred in holding that any change in value of the assets constituting the Estate taking place between the date of the death of the Testator and the date of distribution would change the amount of the succession duties payable.\n3. That the majority in the Court in banco erred in holding in effect that there had been overpayment of succession duties by the Executors and that the Executors were liable to reimburse the Estate for any such overpayment.\n4. That the majority in the Court in banco erred in not holding that the Executors were entitled to pay out of the assets of the Estate to the Provinces of Nova Scotia, Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia the succession duties claimed by the said Provinces respectively in respect of property passing to the various legatees named in the Will or chargeable to such legatees respectively.\nC. B. Smith K.C. for the appellant.\nNo one for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice\u2014I have had an opportunity of considering the judgment of my brother Hudson and I concur with his conclusion.\nCrocket J. (dissenting).\u2014I think this appeal should be dismissed. The question involved in the appeal to the Nova Scotia Supreme Court en banc from the decision of Carroll J., on an originating summons, concerned the propriety of the payment by the appellants as executors and trustees of and under the will of one, H. M. Jost, of succession duties in respect of the various bequests thereof. The testator died on August 25th, 1929. His estate consisted almost entirely of listed stocks and shares, the market value of which, after making the statutory deductions, was placed at $792,289.74. The will directed the setting aside as a trust fund of $150,000, the income of which was to be paid for life to his nephew, J. J. Gaetz, and that on his death the fund should fall into and become part of the residue of the testator's estate with the proviso that, if Gaetz's wife should survive him (which she did), she was to be paid $1,200 yearly for life. It also made a number of specific bequests to other beneficiaries. These bequests, including the trust fund, aggregated $482,150. The whole of the residue was bequeathed to the Regents of Mount Allison Universe\nClause 79 of the will read as follows:\nIt is my Will that no bequests be paid for three years after my demise except the half yearly income to my nephew John J. Gaetz or to his wife in the event of her surviving him. This provision is to allow the Executors time to dispose of my securities to the best advantage and not in a depressed market.\nThe will contained no express instructions about payment of succession duties.\nThe executors filed succession duty returns for the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec with the proper officers in November, 1929. The returns for Nova Scotia, however, were not filed until September, 1931, while those for British Columbia were not filed until late in 1932 or early in 1933\u2014after the expiration of a period of three years from the testator's death. Succession duties claimed by the Province of Ontario to the amount of $74,876.49 were paid in March, 1931, and further sums, it appears, amounting to $2,155.01, were paid to the Government of the Province of Ontario in respect of the Gaetz legacy in the years 1932 and 1933. As for the Quebec succession duties, it is simply stated in the case, as it comes before us, that the executors paid $1,000 in 1930 and the balance ($21,928.86) in 1933. The succession duties claimed by the Province of British Columbia ($2,293.31), were paid in the year 1934, and those claimed by the Province of Nova Scotia ($62,798.73), in the years 1935 and 1936. The total amount of succession duties thus paid by the executors, as set out in the case, was $165,052.40, which, it appears, included interest. Nothing is said about the filing of any succession duty returns for the Province of New Brunswick, though it is said in the agreed case submitted to the Supreme Court that\nincluded in the bulk sums paid are succession duties claimed in respect of the residuary legacy which would have passed to Mount Allison University had it been possible to realize the assets at inventory price as at the death of the testator,\nand that\non a rough break-down it is estimated that had the assets proved sufficient to pay all the legacies in full including the residuary gift to Mount Allison, the amount of succession duty in all four provinces attributable to the property thus passing to Mount Allison would be approximately $79,271.17.\nSo that of the total $165,052.40 paid for succession duties to the other four provinces, $79,271.17 was paid on account of the residuary bequest to the University of Mount Allison in the Province of New Brunswick.\nIt is said in the statement of facts, as agreed upon between the solicitor for the appellants and Mr. F. D. Smith, K.C., (who was appointed solicitor and counsel by the court en banc to oppose the appeal to that court, on account of no one having appeared to represent the defendant respondent), in explanation of the seemingly extraordinary situation regarding the payment of these succession duties, that\nshortly after the executors entered upon their duties and before they had realized any portion of the estate, the stock market took an unprecedented and severe slump and the value of the securities constituting the estate fell very much below the inventory values, with the result that the estate has ever since been insufficient to pay the legacies in full;\nand that\nno attempt was made prior to or at the time of payment to break down these duties and allocate them to the various legatees, nor were the legatees ever called upon to pay to the executors the amount of succession duties claimed to be payable in respect of their respective legacies, but the amounts claimed as duties were paid by the executors on the footing that they constituted a charge upon the assets of the estate and that they were legally bound to pay them.\nThe question stated for the opinion of the learned trial judge on the originating summons was:\nQ. Were the Executors entitled to pay out of the assets of the estate to the Provinces of Nova Scotia, Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia the succession duties claimed by the said Provinces respectively in respect of property passing to the various legatees named in the will or chargeable to such legatees respectively? To this he answered \"No\". On appeal to the Supreme Court en banc, as I have said, no one appeared to oppose, and that court, having assigned Mr. Smith to that duty, the agreed statement of facts referred to was submitted and argued, pro and con, with the result that the appeal was dismissed by Graham, Doull and Archibald JJ.; Hall J. dissenting. The case now comes to us on appeal from this judgment and was here heard ex parte.\nIt was stated by counsel for the appellant that the sole question for determination is whether or not the executors paid the duties computed on a wrong basis, and as the case was presented to the Nova Scotia court on the said agreed statement of facts, that may be true in a sense. But, as I read the written reasons of both Graham and Doull JJ., for the majority judgment, I gather that in their view the real question was whether the executors were entitled to charge the assets of the estate with the entire amount of these payments as calculated and allocated by themselves as succession duties payable by them in respect of property passing to the various legatees named in the will within the meaning of the Succession Duty Act of Nova Scotia, notwithstanding the fact that the executors knew when they paid these duties that the property was insufficient to pay the specific bequests in full, and that there could be no residue.\nGraham J., after referring to the relevant provisions of the Act, as set out in the judgment of his brother, Doull, distinctly held that property which \"passes on the death of any person\" within the meaning of the Succession Duty Act means property which changes hands at the death; that it vests in the executor, though he has no beneficial interest in it; that it only actually \"passes\" to the beneficiary when it reaches him; that it would be unreasonable and unjust to levy duty in respect of property that the beneficiary never received, and that it should only be levied if the Act, in the clearest terms, directed it. In this I fully agree with that learned judge.\nDoull J., with whom Archibald J. concurred, considered particularly the effect of s. 10 (1) in the light of s. 2 (1) of the interpretation clause, and s. 11 (1). Section 10 (1) provides that every person to or for whose benefit any property passes on the death of any other person shall be liable for the duty upon so much of the property as so passes to him.\nSection 11 (1) enacts that\n* * * an executor * * * shall not transfer or deliver such property to the person so entitled without deducting therefrom the duty for which such person is liable.\nIn effect he concluded that, whether s. 10 (1) was itself a sufficient indication, the whole intendment of the Act, as regards the payment of succession duties, in respect of the passing of personal property to specific or residuary legatees, was that such succession duties should not be paid where the property does not pass to the intended beneficiaries. \"The argument against the executors,\" he said,\nis that the liability to pay the succession duty rests upon the legatees, and that there can be no Liability upon any particular legatee unless he received some portion of the estate. I think that this contention is correct, although * * * the matter is not quite so simple as might appear from that statement.\nLater, after discussing the particular sections I have mentioned, he said:\nAs the case stands now before the Court, the only question is whether the executors paid these duties on a proper basis. There is nothing in the Act requiring them to pay the duties before they can ascertain what the legacies are going to be. For example, they certainly should not pay succession duty on an estate of $1,000,000 until it appeared that the case was not one where there was $1,000,000 of debts.\nAnd further:\u2014\nNow, assume that the estate at the death of the testator had a fair market value of $800,000, and that $150,000 was an outright gift to one legatee in priority to all other gifts and assume that before payment could be made or the security sold, the estate had shrunk to $150,000. In such a case duty is payable on $800,000 but it is payable by the one legatee and not by the following legatees, who receive nothing. Even the preferred legatee would be required to pay only to the extent of the property which he receives.\nApplying this to the present case, Mount Allison University received nothing and pays nothing. It should not appear on the list of persons to whom property passes. The property must be assessed at the value at the date of testator's death, but the only way of working this out is finding the amount to which each legatee will be entitled and to affix to that amount its proper proportion of the total value at the date of testator's death. The residuary legatee received nothing and does not come into the calculation.\nThis was quite evident to the executors before they made any payment of succession duty and if by paying duty on a bequest to a charity outside of the province for which there will be no funds, the succession duty, which must be borne by the others, has been increased by applying a rate not applicable to those others, the executors are clearly responsible.\nThere are no figures before the Court of Appeal, but I understand that, by assuming that a gift passed to Mount Allison University or by assuming that legatees other than John J. Gaetz obtained their gifts in full, the succession duty was considerably increased. If so, I see no reason why the executors should not be chargeable with the difference.\nWhether or not the expression \"so much of the property as so passes to him\" (the beneficiary), as used in s. 10 (1), can properly be said to exclude any personal property, such as share certificates,\u2014which in strictness of law as well as in point of fact do not pass to anybody on the owner's death, and certainly not to the executors of the deceased's estate until the executors are appointed and the transfer of the certificates is legally completed,\u2014there can, I think, be no doubt that this particular provision cannot possibly be construed as imposing any liability whatever upon the beneficiary for succession duties upon any property which he has not received.\nI agree with the conclusion of the majority judges that the executors, in view of the facts of this case, were not justified in paying out of the assets of the estate the succession duties they did, and which admittedly included an amount of approximately $79,000 in respect of the gift to the Regents of Mount Allison University, that they fully realized at the time was of no value whatsoever.\nThe appeal, in my opinion, should be dismissed.\nKerwin J. (dissenting).\u2014The Nova Scotia Succession Duty Act is chapter 18 of the Revised Statutes of 1923. By section 3:\nFor the purpose of raising a revenue for Provincial purposes, * * * there shall be levied and paid for the use of the Province a duty * * * at the rates hereinafter specified upon all property hereinafter mentioned * * * which passes on the death of any person who shall hereafter die, the duty to be according to the fair market value of such property at the date of the death of the deceased.\nThe definition of the expression \"passing on the death\" does not assist in the consideration of the present appeal, but subsection 2 of section 3 lists what shall be included in \"property passing on the death.\" By section 5,\u2014\nIn determining the aggregate value of property the fair market value shall be taken as at the date of the death of the deceased of all property passing on his death. By section 6,\u2014\nIn determining the dutiable value of property the fair market value shall be taken as at the date of the death of the deceased of property subject to duty.\nBy section 7,\u2014\nthe property on which succession duty shall be levied and paid under this Chapter at the rates hereinafter specified shall be as follows:\nand then follows what is really a list of the dutiable property.\nSubsection 1 of section 9 reads in part as follows:\n9. (1) If any property subject to duty passes on the death of any person, either in whole or in part, to or for the benefit of the grandfather, grandmother, father, mother, husband, wife, child, grandchild, daughter-in-law or son-in-law of the deceased, the same or as much thereof as so passes shall be subject to duty as follows:\nIf the aggregate value of the property passing on the death of such person\u2014\n(a) exceeds twenty-five thousand dollars but does not exceed seventy-five thousand dollars to a duty at the rate of two dollars and fifty cents for every one hundred dollars of the dutiable value;\nThe expression \"to or for the benefit of\" occurs in other subsections and explains the wording in subsection 1 of section 10:\n10. (1) Every person to or for whose benefit any property passes on the death of any other person shall be liable for the duty upon so much of the property as so passes to him.\nThe tax is thus imposed in respect of property \"passing on the death\". The executor or trustee is not liable for the payment of it, although he is required to deduct the duty before transferring to a legatee, etc., any property to which such person is entitled, failing which the executor or trustee is made liable to a penalty equal to twice the amount of the duty. Apart from this, the only one liable is the person to or for whose benefit any property passes under section 10.\nIt is true, the fair market value of the property is to be taken as at the date of the death of the deceased. It must be borne in mind that we are dealing with general legacies of specific amounts, except, of course, the residuary bequest. The Regents of Mount Allison University, while expecting to receive a substantial sum, actually received nothing, and it cannot be intended that they still would be liable for succession duty taxes. The University, of course, was outside Nova Scotia, but it cannot be held that an individual legatee resident in Nova Scotia, who actually received nothing although the will mentioned a bequest of a large sum, should pay a tax.\nI am of opinion that in the present case the executors acted unreasonably, particularly as they knew when they paid a great portion of the duties that the assets would not be nearly sufficient to pay all the legacies. Clause 4 of the original order of Mr. Justice Carroll, of August 3rd, 1932, provides:\u2014\n4. That in the administration of the said Estate the said Executors have acted honestly and reasonably and ought fairly to foe excused for any breach of trust that may have heretofore arisen in the administration of the said Estate and for omitting to heretofore obtain directions of the Court in connection with any matter arising in the administration of the said Estate, and the said Executors and each of them be hereby wholly relieved from any personal liability for any such breach of trust or failure to take directions of the Court.\nAny breach of trust that may have arisen before that order and from which therefore, by its terms, the executors ought fairly to be excused, should be held not to apply to the payment of succession duty, as that question was not raised in the originating summons on which the order was based.\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nThe judgment of Hudson and Taschereau JJ. was delivered by\nHudson J.\u2014The testator, Jost, died leaving a large estate consisting almost entirely of stocks and shares. By his will he directed that $150,000 should be set aside as a trust fund to provide an annuity for a nephew, and, following this, there were numerous bequests of specific sums to various persons and institutions, and finally a general residuary bequest to the Regents of Mount Allison University.\nSoon after the executors entered on their duties, there was a serious depreciation in the value of the assets, so that it appeared that there must be an abatement in the legacies of specific sums and that there would be no residue. Notwithstanding this depreciation of assets, the executors paid succession duties on the basis of the value of the estate at the time of death and at the rates appropriate to the different classes of beneficiaries, including the Regents of Mount Allison University, as named in the will. This action of the executors was questioned, and the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco has ruled, quoting from the formal judgment of the Court:\nThe executors are entitled to pay succession duties based upon the rates applicable to the persons who receive property or beneficial interest in property from the estate of the deceased and not at rates applicable to persons by whom no property or beneficial interest in property is received, although such latter persons may have been named in the will.\nThe majority of the judges in the Court in banco held the view that the rate at which the duties are to be calculated is dependent upon the relationship of the persons who receive the proceeds of the estate on distribution rather than on the relationship of those who would have received such proceeds had the estate realized inventory value and been distributed according to the directions contained in the will.\nThe question thus raised is important, as it affects the administration of the Succession Duties Acts in all of the Canadian provinces.\nPortions of this estate for taxation purposes were in four different provinces but, as the material statutory provisions in each of these provinces are substantially the same, it will be sufficient to consider those of Nova Scotia, from which province this appeal comes to us. The Nova Scotia Act is chapter 18 of the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia, 1923. It provides:\nSection 3:\n(1) For the purpose of raising a revenue for Provincial purposes, and save as is hereinafter, otherwise expressly provided, there shall be levied and paid for the use of the Province a duty (called Succession Duty), at the rates hereinafter specified upon all property hereinafter mentioned which has passed on the death of any person who has died on or since the 1st day of July, A.D. 1892, or which passes on the death of any person who shall hereafter die, the duty to be according to the fair market value of such property at the date of the death of the deceased.\n(2) Property passing on the death of the deceased shall be deemed to include for all purposes of this Chapter the property following, that is to say:\n(a) property of which the deceased was at the time of his death competent to dispose;\n***\nSection 5:\nIn determining the aggregate value of property the fair market value shall be taken as at the date of the death of the deceased of all property passing on his death, including the value of property situate out of Nova Scotia, and a deduction or allowance shall be made of the deductions and allowances hereinafter mentioned in respect of dutiable value. Section 9 (1):\nIf any property subject to duty passes on the death of any person, either in whole or in part, to or for the benefit of the grandfather, grandmother, father, mother, husband, wife, child, grandchild, daughter-in-law or son-in-law of the deceased, the same or as much thereof as so passes shall be subject to duty as follows:\u2014\nthe rates applicable to the different classes being then specified. Section 10 (1) provides:\nEvery person to or for whose benefit any property passes on the death of any other person shall be liable for the duty upon so much of the property as so passes to him.\nSection 11 (1):\nNo executor shall in the first instance be personally liable to pay the duty on any property which passes on the death of the deceased and to which any person is beneficially entitled, but an executor or other person in whom any i\u00ednterest in any property so passing or the management thereof is at any time vested, shall not transfer or deliver such property to the person so entitled without deducting therefrom the duty for which such person is liable.\nThen follows a penalty for failing to observe this duty. Section 13 (1) provides:\nUnless otherwise in this Chapter provided, the duty imposed by this Chapter shall be due at the death of the deceased and payable within eighteen months thereafter * * *\nSection 16 (1):\nEvery person to or for whose benefit any property passes on the death of any other person and every executor shall, within three months after the death of the deceased or such later time as may be allowed by the Treasurer, make and file with the Treasurer a full, true and correct statement under oath giving\u2014\n(a) a full inventory in detail of all the property which passed on the death of the deceased and the fair market value thereof on the date of his death; including all property that passed on his death and which is situate out of Nova Scotia;\n(b) the several persons to or for whose benefit the same passes, their places of residence and the degrees of relationship, if any, in which they stand to the deceased.\nThen follow provisions for settling the values in accordance with the provisions of the statute.\nIf we exclude for the moment consideration of the provision contained in section 10 (1), it would appear quite clear that the tax imposed by the statute is intended to be determined by the state of things existing at the date of death of the deceased. The value of the assets is to be ascertained as of that date and the duty is then due, although the date for payment is postponed for eighteen months. The corresponding provisions in the New Brunswick Act were under consideration by the Judicial Committee in the case of The King v. Lovitt[3], and it was stated by Lord Robson, at page 223:\nAlthough called a succession duty, the tax here in question was laid on the corpus of the property, and the statute made its payment a term of the grant of ancillary probate. By s. 6 the executor is required to give a bond for its due payment, and if he fails to do so the probate granted to him is cancelled. He is directed to deduct the duty before handing over the property; to pay it forthwith to the Receiver General of the province; and if a foreign executor transfers the stock of any company in the province liable to duty, on which the duty has not been paid, he is to pay it, and the company permitting such transfer shall also become liable.\nThese provisions shew that the Act under consideration assimilates the tax to the probate duty. It is imposed as part of the price to be paid by the representatives of a deceased testator for the collection or local administration of taxable property within the province, and, in the view of their Lordships, it is intended to be a direct burden on that property, varying in amount according to the relationship of the successor to the testator.\nIt is quite clear, then, that the tax is primarily a property tax and, as stated by Lord Robson, it is intended to be a direct burden on that property, varying in amount according to the relationship of the successor to the testator. In Lord Robson's view, the tax is assimilated to a probate or estate duty in contrast to the legacy and what is called in the English Act succession duty, where by express provision the legatee or beneficiary need not pay until the time arrives for distribution, and then on the value as at the date of such distribution.\nThe provision in the New Brunswick statute corresponding to section 10 (1) of the Nova Scotia Act, imposing personal liability, was not relevant to the question under discussion in the Lovitt case[4] and does not seem to have given rise to any comment there. However, it is this section which creates some serious difficulty here. The argument is this: that in section 10 (1) obviously the words \"passes on the death\" must refer to the actual passing of property into the hands of the beneficiary, as otherwise a beneficiary would be personally liable for a duty in respect of property which he had not received and might never receive, a result so manifestly unfair and unreasonable that the Legislature could not possibly have so intended. The majority of the judges in the Court below avoid this situation by construing the words \"passes on the death\" as used in section 10 (1), and the words \"passing on the death\" in section 3 (1), as applicable only to the time when the property was distributed to the beneficiaries.\nA section of the British Columbia Succession Duty Act corresponding to section 10 (1) of the Nova Scotia Act was under consideration by the British Columbia Court of Appeal in the case of In Re Drummond Estate[5]; and the majority of that Court faced the difficulty and dealt with it in the following way (page 265):\nMr. Symes submitted that, at this stage, in the administration of the estate, the executors only were liable to pay the duty, the beneficiaries under the will not being \"liable for payment\" until their interests vested. I cannot agree. Section 10 (2) of the Act reads: \"Every person domiciled or resident in the Province to whom property situate within the Province subject to any duty imposed by this Act passes shall be personally liable for the duty.\"\nThe obligation is limited to persons domiciled or resident in the Province. They are personally liable for payment of the duty on any property passing to them by the will. If the word \"passed\" had been used this contention might be sound, assuming it was not defined in the interpretation section. We have a definition of the word \"passing\" or \"passing on death\" in section 2 of the Act. Without quoting it is clear that it is not restricted to property finally vesting in the beneficiary upon distribution of the estate. The word \"passes\" is used in other sections of the Act in a sense inconsistent with the view that it means a vested interest.\nIt was submitted that the Legislature could not have intended that the beneficiaries should be liable to pay the duty before they received the property or money upon which the tax is levied, as it might later transpire from various causes that their shares might disappear or their value be diminished. By section 11 however the duties are made payable at the death although in working out the Act and in the administration of the estate it is not, I assume, demanded (or in fact ascertained) at that time. The beneficiaries are personally liable for payment where the property passes by operation of the will even though it may not be demanded at that time.\nThe definition of \"passing on the death\" in section 2(1) of the Nova Scotia Act and corresponding sections of the other Provincial Acts is as follows:\n2. (1) In this Chapter, unless the context otherwise requires: (a) the expression \"passing on the death\", or a similar expression, means passing either immediately on the death or after an interval either certainly or contingently and either originally or by way of substitutive limitation, whether the deceased was at the time of his death domiciled in Nova Scotia or elsewhere.\nwhich gives no real assistance in disposing of the difficulty. The direct application of section 10 (1) here is not the question. The duty in respect of the residuary bequest has been paid. The complaint is that it has been overpaid, inasmuch as the rate applicable to a bequest to the residuary legatee in this case would be somewhat higher than the rate payable by more preferred beneficiaries and the burden thus imposed on them would be greater to that extent. The situation is anomalous, but that is not sufficient in itself to override the language of the statute. Reference here might be made to the remarks of Lord Hanworth in the case of Attorney-General for Ontario v. National Trust Company[6]:\n* * * suppose on the facts of the present case that the value of the property at the time of the gift had been $260,000, and that had dwindled down to $10,000 at the time of the death, there would have been a hardship upon the donee, who would then have been compelled to pay duty as upon a value 26 times that to which the property had diminished at the time of the death. The tax would have been payable, but the gift would provide no sufficient resources from which to pay it.\nI agree with what was said by Mr. Justice Hall in the last paragraph of his dissenting judgment in the Court below:\nThe object and meaning of The Succession Duty Act must be gathered from the' words of the statute. It is the purpose and intention of the Act that the two factors necessary to determine the duty\u2014evaluation and rates\u2014shall be constant. Irrespective of market fluctuations, duty shall be levied upon the fair market value (less deductions) at the date of death. The rate is determined by the relationship or nature of the person for whose benefit property passed on the death. Computation is made by applying the appropriate rate to property passing to each person beneficially on the death of the testator. The duty is paid on the basis of the distribution intended by the testator. The executor deducts the amount which was payable on each legacy under section 10 (1). He must do this in order to carry on the administration of the estate. Succession Duties are \"a first lien upon the property in respect to which they are payable until they are paid\", and the executors cannot discharge their functions as executors until they have freed the assets of the estate from this lien and have paid the duties.\nand would allow the appeal and answer affirmatively the question submitted in the summons, costs to be paid out of the estate.\nAppeal allowed; costs throughout of all parties to be paid out of the estate.\nSolicitor for the appellant: C.
