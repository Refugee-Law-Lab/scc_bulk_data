(ad hoc).\n1935: Feb. 25, 26; 1935: April 15.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW BRUNSWICK, APPEAL DIVISION\nConditional sate\u2014Default in payment\u2014Repossession and resale by vendor\u2014Question of vendor\u2019s right to sue for deficiency\u2014Conditional Sales Act, R.S.N.B., 1927, c. 152, s. 10.\nAppellant sold to respondent a motor truck on a conditional sale agreement, and took as collateral a promissory note for the amount of the deferred payments. The agreement provided that the title to the truck was to remain in the vendor\u2019s name until payment in full of the purchase price and interest. The agreement did not expressly provide for the purchaser to have possession nor for the vendor to retake possession and resell, or to recover deficiency on resale. At the time of the agreement possession was delivered to respondent. On subsequent default in payment, appellant retook possession (apparently with respondent\u2019s expressed or implied consent) and resold the truck (after fulfilling the procedure required by s. 10 of the Conditional Sales Act of New Brunswick), realizing an amount less than that owing on the note, and sued on the note for the deficiency.\nHeld: Appellant\u2019s resale of the truck had the effect of rescinding or terminating the contract, and of relieving respondent from further obligation as to the price (McEntire v. Crossley, 64 L.J.P.C. 129; Sawyer v. Pringle, 18 Ont. A.R. 218), and appellant could not recover.\nSec. 10 of the Conditional Sales Act, R.S.N.B., 1927, c. 152, does not create by implication a right in the seller to look to the buyer for a deficiency; s. 10 (3) merely limits and regulates the exercise of such a right where the right exists independently of the statute. The Act must not be regarded as a complete code; nor construed as repealing the common law as to the effect of a resale in a case such as the present one. Nor did the terms of the agreement in question justify the application of the \u201cmortgage theory\u201d (by regarding the conditional sale as in effect a legal mortgage and governed by the law relating to mortgages) so as to give a right to resell and look to the buyer for any deficiency (C. C. Motor Sales Ltd. v. Chan [1926] Can. S.C.R. 485, distinguished).\nThe court could not treat the action as one for damages for breach by respondent of his contract to purchase; and could not, therefore, regard the amount of the deficiency as the measure of damages which appellant might have obtained had he sued on that ground. The promissory note, on which the action was brought, being collateral to the agreement, was rescinded as between the parties by the rescission of the agreement.\nJudgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division (8 M.P.R. 57), affirmed. APPEAL by the plaintiff (by special leave) from a judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division, which[1] had allowed an appeal by defendant from an order of the Judge of the Westmorland County Court in favour of the plaintiff in an action for the balance claimed on a certain promissory note (made by defendant as collateral to a certain conditional sale agreement for sale by plaintiff to defendant of a motor truck). The material facts of the case and questions in issue are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported (except that it may be further mentioned that before reselling the truck in question the plaintiff fulfilled the procedure required by s. 10 of the Conditional Sales Act of New Brunswick) and are indicated in the above headnote. The appeal was dismissed with costs.\nJ. L. Ralston K.C. and E. Friel for the appellant.\nG. F. G. Bridges for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nDysart J. (ad hoc)\u2014This is an appeal from the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division, reversing a judgment of the County Court of Westmorland in favour of the appellant (plaintiff) in an action for the balance of the sale price of a motor truck. The appeal involves the interpretation and effect of a conditional sale agreement, and of the Conditional Sales Act, R.S.N.B. 1927, cap. 152.\nThe facts are simple. On October 15, 1932, the respondent purchased a motor truck from the appellant upon the terms and conditions set forth in a conditional sale agreement which was styled \u201cRetail Buyers\u2019 Order and Agreement.\u201d The price of the truck, $815, was made payable, as to part in the equivalent of cash, and as to the balance, namely, $565, in consecutive monthly instalments of $25 each with interest. A promissory note payable in one month, but renewable monthly on payment of the instalments provided for in the agreement, was also given by the buyer as collateral to the agreement. Among the \u201cterms and conditions\u201d of the contract is the following:\nIt is expressly understood and agreed that the title to the motor vehicle is to remain in Vendor\u2019s name until the full amount of purchase price and interest and other charges have been paid.\nThe truck was immediately given into the possession of the buyer, a feature of the transaction not provided for by the written contract. A few months later, the buyer being then in default in his payments, the seller retook possession of the truck, resold it for less than the amount owing on the note, and then, in an action on the note, obtained judgment for the deficiency, about $300. This judgment was reversed on appeal, and from that reversal the present appeal is taken.\nThe case is of importance not because of the amount involved, but because it is in the nature of a test case.\nThe sole issue is whether or not the seller, having repossessed and resold the truck with the acquiescence of the buyer, has the right to sue for the deficiency on the resale. The answer to that question depends upon the interpretation and effect of the contract which the parties entered into. No such right is conferred by the written contract, certainly not in express terms. Apart from the provision already quoted, wherein the title is reserved to the seller until full payment of the price, the agreement contains only one provision which has been thought capable of conferring such right. The provision is:\u2014\nI agree to pay the balance due and accept the motor vehicle mentioned in this order and agreement within forty-eight hours after I have been notified that it is ready for delivery. Failure on my part to comply, forfeits my deposit as liquidated damages for your expense and efforts, and permits you to otherwise dispose of the motor vehicle without any liability to me whatsoever.\nThis provision, like some others in the document, is not applicable to the sale which the parties here intended, but is designed to cover a case where the buyer orders a motor vehicle which the seller has not then on hand or at least not then ready for delivery, and which he is therefore to deliver or tender for delivery at some then future date. In the sale as arranged in the present case, the truck was on hand at the time the bargain was entered into, and was immediately delivered to the buyer. The presence of the provision in the contract is due to the evident fact that the contract was drawn up on a general \u201cform\u201d designed to cover different kinds of sales with apt provisions for all of them.\nApart from that clause there is not a word in the contract expressly giving the seller the right, whether on default of payment or other breach of condition by the buyer, to retake possession or to resell or to recover any deficiency on a resale. There is not even a provision that possession should pass to the buyer while title remains with the seller, and consequently, there was no need to provide for the seller\u2019s retaking of possession.\nThe act of retaking possession was evidently acquiesced in or consented to by the buyer and so the seller\u2019s right to repossess was never questioned nor determined. It is important, however, that the right, if any, be now ascertained and declared because, as we shall presently see, if possession was retaken under the provisions of the contract, then section 10 of the Conditional Sales Act will apply to it, whereas if possession was not retaken under the contract, but under some other right, the section will not apply.\nWhen the buyer defaulted in his payments, the seller retook possession as a matter of fact, but the default itself did not authorize such repossession. According to the contract, the seller\u2019s only protection or security for the price was to hold the title until payment was made. In these circumstances, the retaking of possession was a tortious act on the part of the seller unless the retaking was effected with the consent expressed or implied of the buyer, as it apparently was. Once the seller had thus resumed possession, and there being no provision in the contract entitling the buyer to have possession, the seller was entitled to hold it as an incident of ownership of the truck. The situation then was that the seller, having both title and possession, and the buyer being under an obligation to pay the price by instalments, the agreement was an ordinary executory contract for future sale, and the seller had no right to recover the price unless he delivered or was ready and willing to deliver the truck. The resale of the truck had the effect of rescinding or terminating the contract, and of relieving the buyer from further obligation in regard to the price. McEntire v. Crossley, a decision of the House of Lords[2]; Sawyer v. Pringle[3]. There are other decisions in some of our provincial courts to the same effect.\nTurning now to the Conditional Sales Act. Section 2(b) defines a conditional sale in terms which clearly include the transaction in this case as it stood immediately prior to the default. It reads in part as follows:\n2. (b) \u201cConditional sale\u201d means (a) any contract for the sale of goods under which possession is or is to be delivered to the buyer and the property in the goods is to vest in him at a subsequent time upon payment of the whole or part of the price or the performance of any other condition;\nSection 10 of the Act will have to be set out more fully.\n10. (1) Where the seller retakes possession of the goods pursuant to any condition in the contract, he shall retain them for twenty days, and the buyer may redeem the same within that period by paying or tendering to the seller the balance of the contract price, together with the actual costs and expenses of taking and keeping possession, or by performance or tender of performance of the condition upon which the property in the goods is to vest in the buyer and payment of such costs and expenses; and thereupon the seller shall deliver up to the buyer possession of the goods so redeemed.\n(2) When the goods are not redeemed within the period of twenty days, and subject to the giving of the notice of sale prescribed by this section, the seller may sell the goods, either by private sale or at public auction, at any time after the expiration of that period.\n(3) If the price of the goods exceeds thirty dollars and the seller intends to look to the buyer for any deficiency on a resale, the goods shall not be resold until after notice in writing of the intended sale has been given to the buyer.\n[(4), (5) and (6) relate to the notice, its contents, and when it may be given.]\n(7). This section shall apply notwithstanding any agreement of the contrary.\nThis section is in the same terms as the corresponding section in the British Columbia Act. The corresponding provisions in the Ontario Act do not include the right of resale expressed by subsection (2) and refer to cases where possession is retaken for \u201cbreach of condition\u201d instead of \u201cpursuant to any condition in the contract.\u201d\nIt is argued by the appellant that this Act is a code, and should, therefore, be interpreted in a liberal, comprehensive way as though it were replacing common law, and stating anew the entire body of law relating to conditional sales. This argument follows that of the late Mr. Justice Ordre in the Ontario Court of Appeal in the case of Harris v. Tong[4]. On the other hand, the respondent urges that the Act was designed to correct certain defects in the common law and to prevent frauds on the public, growing out of transactions in which possession and apparent ownership of a chattel are committed to one person while the title and real ownership remain in another; and that, having corrected these evils, the Act leaves the rest of the law untouched.\nThe latter view commends itself to us as quite sound and consistent with the text of the Act. The first few sections of the Act are designed evidently to protect the public against the evils mentioned; sections 9 and 10 are designed to protect the buyer and to give certain rights to the seller. The Act does not pretend to apply to all conditional sales and impliedly excludes many; subject to the imperative terms and conditions imposed upon conditional sales, the Act leaves the parties free to insert in their contract any mutually protective terms and conditions they may desire.\nSubsections (1) and (2) of section 10 give the buyer the right to redeem within twenty days and the seller the right to resell after twenty days, in all cases where the chattel has been repossessed \u201cpursuant to any condition in the contract.\u201d The Act does not expressly confer such rights except where possession has been retaken pursuant to some term in the contract. Subsection (3) of the same section apparently relates to goods repossessed as mentioned in subsections (1) and (2) and provides procedure to be followed by the seller if he \u201cintends to look to the buyer for any deficiency on a resale.\u201d This subsection is restricted to goods in excess of $30 in price; it does not apply to goods of a lesser value nor when repossession is not based on the contract. The subsection does not create a right in the seller to look to the buyer for a deficiency; it merely limits and regulates the exercise of the right in all cases where the right exists independently of the statute.\nNo other provision in the Act has been invoked as conferring on the seller the right to claim a deficiency.\nIt is argued, however, that the section confers the right by implication. This argument is based upon the assumption that the Act is a code and is to be construed as embracing all conditional sales. As already pointed out, we do not regard the Act as a complete code. If the Conditional Sales Act seeks only to remedy certain evils inherent in or incidental to conditional sales, it ought to be interpreted as amending and not as repealing the common law on the subject; if, on the other hand, it is a general Act, it \u201cmust not be read as repealing the common law relating to a special and particular matter unless there is something in the general Act to indicate an intention to deal with that special and particular matter\u201d (per Channell J. in The King v. Bishop of Salisbury[5]. To interpret section 10 as appellant suggests, would be to import into the section something which is not there and which, if there, would have the effect of repealing the common law. We are therefore unable to accept the conclusions based upon the argument.\nIt is also urged that all conditional sales are in effect legal mortgages, and should, therefore, be governed by the law relating to mortgages. On this basis, the right of a mortgagee to resell his security and look to the mortgagor for any deficiency on the resale is thought to be applicable to a vendor under a conditional sale where he resells the chattel. This theory was propounded by Maclennan J.A., in his dissenting judgment in the case of Sawyer v. Pringle[6]; was adopted by Newcombe J., in delivering the unanimous opinion of this court in C. C. Motor Sales Ltd. v. Chan[7]; and was later elaborated by Orde J.A. in the Ontario Court of Appeal in the case of Harris v. Tong[8]. An examination of the agreements in each of these three cases discloses a wide difference in terms. In the two Ontario cases, the theory was rejected or at least was not adopted by a majority of the judges, and, in any event, the decision turned upon the interpretation of the agreement then before the courts. In the Chan case7, Newcombe J., in expressing the opinion that the agreement was in effect a legal mortgage, emphasized the fact that \u201cby the express provisions of three of the clauses\u201d the agreement was intended to \u201coperate as a security to the vendor for the principal and interest of the debt.\u201d The agreement with which we have to deal is noticeably different in that there is a complete absence of any reference directly or indirectly to security. Moreover, Newcombe J. in the Chan case[9] supported the mortgage theory on the additional ground that the agreement in that case had certain elements of absoluteness in which it differed from the agreement in Sawyer v. Pringle[10] which was thought to be more uncertain. On this point the agreement with which we are dealing contains the following clause: \u201cIt is expressly agreed that if for any reason purchase of motor vehicle is not consummated,\u201d certain consequences are specified to follow as in a case of rescission. This lack of absoluteness, coupled with a paucity of protective or remedial provisions, sharply distinguishes this agreement from that in the Chan case9 as well as from mortgages generally. Whatever may be thought of the applicability of the mortgage theory to some conditional sale agreements, the theory does not apply to all such agreements, certainly not to this one. Each contract must stand on its own footing and be interpreted in the light of its own terms and conditions. This principle was adopted in the Chan case9 where Newcombe J. at page 487 said: \u201cThe question depends upon the interpretation and effect of the agreement of sale between the parties.\u201d\nIn disposing of this appeal, we are not at liberty to treat the action as one for damages for breach by the buyer of his contract to purchase, and may not, therefore, regard the amount of the deficiency as the measure of the damages which the seller might have obtained had he sued on that ground and for which he had a right to sue; Harold Wood Brick Co. v. Ferris[11]. The action as brought was on the promissory note for the balance owing on it after the net proceeds of the resale had been credited, but, because the note was collateral to the written contract, it was rescinded as between the parties by the rescission of the agreement. We have seen that a right to sue for a deficiency after the resale was not provided for by the contract nor conferred by the Conditional Sales Act, and so there is no ground on which the seller\u2019s action can be maintained.\nThe appeal will, therefore, be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Friel & Friel.\nSolicitor for the respondent: G. F. G. Bridges.\n[1] 8 M.P.R. 57; [1934] 3 D.L.R. 140. The formal judgment of the Appeal Division merely reversed an order in the County Court allowing plaintiff to sign summary judgment, and permitted defendant to defend. On proceedings taken subsequently to this judgment (and for the purpose of enabling plaintiff to prosecute an appeal from a final judgment), final judgment was entered in the County Court in favour of the defendant, from which plaintiff appealed to the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, and it was from the dismissal of this latter appeal that the present appeal was, in form, brought.\n[2] (1895) 64 L.J.P.C. 129.\n[3] (1891) 18 Ont.

(ad hoc).\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA EN BANC\nStock-broker and client\u2014Carrying of stocks on margin\u2014Alleged instructions by client to sell-Stocks retained on brokers\u2019 advice\u2014Alleged non-disclosure of brokers\u2019 personal interest in stocks of same companies\u2014Brokers\u2019 duties and liabilities.\nThe action was to recover a balance claimed as owing by defendant to a firm of stock-brokers (and now vested in plaintiff) for commissions, etc., and moneys paid in the purchasing and selling of stocks for defendant. Defendant claimed that in July, 1930, when prices were declining and he was being pressed for marginal protection, he told the brokers to sell out; that if the stocks had been sold at that time the account sued on would not have arisen; that the brokers advised him not to sell; that it was on their advice that he subsequently put up more moneys and endeavoured to hold the stocks; that, unknown to defendant, the brokers were interested in pools in stocks of the same companies as those in whose stocks defendant\u2019s holdings largely consisted, and by reason thereof were not in a position to give defendant independent and disinterested advice. There was conflicting evidence, and much contention as to the implications involved in, and the inferences to be drawn from, what was proved. In answers to questions, the jury found that there was a lack of due skill and care by the brokers; that this was \u201cin not selling stock when requested\u201d; that by reason thereof defendant suffered loss equal to or exceeding the amount claimed against him; that defendant, to the brokers\u2019 knowledge, was relying on their advice, and that their advice and their method of handling defendant\u2019s account was not disinterested and in good faith. Judgment dismissing the action was reversed on appeal, and defendant appealed to this Court.\nHeld: There was evidence sufficient to support the jury\u2019s findings, which must, therefore, stand; these indicated, that they accepted defendant\u2019s evidence that he told the brokers to sell in July, 1930 (at which time a sale would have left him without any debit balance); that the brokers advised him not to sell; and that he acted upon their advice, which was not \u201cdisinterested and in good faith.\u201d As to the brokers\u2019 liability in law: Having undertaken to advise, they owed a duty to defendant to advise fully, honestly and in good faith, and the non-disclosure of their own substantial interest in stocks of the same companies as the stocks of defendant which he wanted to sell, was a breach of duty for which the brokers were liable for any damages consequently suffered by defendant; while there was no evidence that defendant would have taken a different course had disclosure been made, yet, once the interest was shewn to exist, the burden was on plaintiff to exonerate the brokers and establish that the advice given and the mode of handling the account was not affected by the brokers\u2019 very large interest in the pools; the fullest and clearest explanation for the non-disclosure rested upon plaintiff and was not given. The judgment at trial dismissing the action should be restored. (Judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc, 7 M.P.R. 544, reversed).\nAPPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc[1] which court, by its formal judgment, allowed the plaintiff\u2019s appeal from the judgment of Ross J. (on the trial with a jury) dismissing the action, and set aside the findings and answers of the jury and the judgment at trial, and ordered judgment for the plaintiff for $136,484.13, with interest. The action was to recover a balance claimed to be owing by defendant to a firm of stock-brokers for work and labour done as stock-brokers for defendant and at his request in and about the purchasing and selling of stocks, shares and securities and for commission and brokerage, and also for moneys paid by the brokers at defendant\u2019s request in the purchasing and selling of stocks, shares and securities for the account of the defendant; which claim had been vested in the present plaintiff. The material facts and circumstances of the case and the questions in issue are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal to this Court was allowed and the judgment of the trial Judge restored, with costs throughout.\nJ. L. Ralston K.C. for the appellant.\nL. A. Lovett K.C. and D. McInnes for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDavis, J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc allowing the appeal of the plaintiff, McD. & C. Holdings Limited, from the judgment dismissing the action after a trial with a jury before the Honourable Mr. Justice Ross. The Court en banc under the judgment appealed from gave judgment for the plaintiff (respondent) against the defendant (appellant) for the sum of $136,484.13 with interest. The action was brought by the respondent against the appellant for the sum of $148,484.13 and interest, which the respondent claimed was the balance owing by the appellant to the firm of McDougall & Cowans, stock brokers, for work and labour done by said McDougall & Cowans as stock brokers for the appellant and at his request in and about the purchasing of stocks, shares and securities and for commission and for brokerage, and also for moneys paid by McDougall & Cowans at the request of the appellant in the purchasing and selling of stocks, shares and securities for the account of the appellant. The respondent further claimed that a receiving order under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act had been made on the 5th day of October, 1931, against said McDougall & Cowans and that by judgment of the Superior Court of the Province of Quebec, Bankruptcy Division, dated the 11th day of March, 1932, the property and assets of McDougall & Cowans in bankruptcy, including the claim alleged in the present action, were vested in the respondent. The said judgment in the bankruptcy court had approved a scheme of arrangement, the proposal for which is Exhibit AA\/12. Under paragraph 1 (b) of this proposal, all the property of McDougall & Cowans vested in the realization company, the present respondent.\nThe statement of defence alleged, (a) that McDougall & Cowans were the confidential advisers of the appellant in connection with the purchase and sale of the stocks, shares and securities; (b) that unknown to the appellant McDougall & Cowans were interested in pools in shares of International Nickel Limited and Brazilian Traction Light, Heat & Power Company, which were the stocks which the appellant very largely held, and by reason thereof were not in a position to give the appellant independent and disinterested advice; (c) that the said McDougall & Cowans advised the appellant from time to time not to sell his stocks, shares and securities; (d) that said McDougall & Cowans failed to sell stocks, shares and securities when intructed so to do by the appellant; (e) that the appellant relied upon the advice given by McDougall & Cowans not to sell such stocks, shares and securities; (f) that the loss for which the respondent is suing in the present action arose from the sale of stocks, shares and securities, which was wrongful inasmuch as the same could have been resold without a loss if McDougall & Cowans\u2019 advice to and their handling of the account of the appellant had been disinterested and in good faith.\nBy an interlocutory order made by Mr. Justice Graham in Chambers, it was ordered that the respondent be at liberty to prove by affidavit (a) the facts in connection with the purchase and sale of the stocks, shares and securities; (b) the disbursements made by McDougall & Cowans; (c) that the stocks, shares and securities were purchased and\/or sold at the request of the appellant; (d) that the moneys alleged to be paid by McDougall & Cowans were paid at the request of the appellant; (e) that the commission and brokerage charges were proper charges; (f) that the rates of exchange were at the then prevailing rates, and (g) that the appellant was entitled to the credits set out in the statement of claim. The respondent put in evidence at the trial of this action affidavits in compliance with the said order. The particulars of the respondent\u2019s claim are contained in Exhibit S\/C.\nThe action came on for trial before Mr. Justice Ross with a jury. The learned trial judge put the entire case to the jury in a series of questions to which, with the answers given by the jury, I shall refer later.\nThe evidence in this case reveals the course of speculation on the stock market immediately before and after the commencement, in the autumn of 1929, of the period of world-wide depression. The appellant was a lumber operator actually engaged in the woods at considerable distances from the city of Halifax. In March, 1926, he opened a marginal trading account with McDougall & Cowans, stock brokers, of Montreal, through their Halifax office. By January, 1929, his cash deposits had only aggregated $9,482.18, and yet it is admitted that by that date he could have taken out of the market in profits an amount of approximately $600,000. He knew that at the time, but chose to remain in the market rather than sell, with the result that by September, 1931, all his remaining stocks in the account had been forced to sale by his brokers or their bankers; and on October 5, 1931, the brokers, McDougall & Cowans, went into bankruptcy. The appellant\u2019s account on their books showed a debit of $148,484.13, and this notwithstanding the fact that the appellant had actually paid in an endeavour to protect his account amounts aggregating nearly $80,000.\nThe assets of the brokerage house were in the course of administration by bankruptcy transferred, with the approval of the court, to a joint stock company incorporated and organized for the benefit of creditors. The company then commenced this action as assignee of the alleged indebtedness of the appellant to the brokers to recover the alleged indebtedness of the appellant in connection with the purchase and sale of the stocks and for commissions, interest, etc.\nThe main defence of the appellant was that, through negligence and breach of duty on the part of the brokers, he had suffered a loss in excess of the alleged indebtedness, and that the one set off the other. Shortly stated, his contention was that after paying in substantial amounts to protect his account in a rapidly falling market (a total of $68,883.86 down to and including July 7, 1930, of which sum $13,096.65 were the proceeds of life insurance, to the knowledge of the brokers) he reached a point about the middle of July, 1930, when he made up his mind to take his loss and sell out his account. He swears definitely that he told Peebles, the manager of the Halifax office of McDougall & Cowans with which he had his account, to sell out the account. It is common ground that the account was not closed out at that time, and it is not in dispute that if the account had been closed out by sale of the stocks in July, 1930 (when the appellant says he told the brokers to sell), there would have been no loss except the amount he had already paid in. The debit and credit would have about balanced, perhaps with eight to ten thousand dollars to the appellant\u2019s credit. A summary of the account as at July 15, 1930, shows an equity of $10,494.59; as at July 20, 1930, an equity of $12,699.59; as at July 25, 1930, an equity of $10,832.59; and at July 31, 1930, an equity of $3,318.92. The appellant says that the fact is that he was prevailed upon by the brokers to \u201chang on\u201d to his stocks, and he did so upon the advice which they gave him, with the result which followed, that he not only lost what he subsequently put up as further margins, $5,000 on July 26, 1930, $4,000 on October 4, 1930, and $500 on April 21, 1931; but incurred a debit balance of over $148,000, which amount the respondent seeks to recover against him in this action.\nFrom the opening of the account in March, 1926, the appellant says he purchased from time to time on the advice of the brokers various stocks until he was holding in May, 1929, 24 different stocks. From May, 1929, to January, 1930, he says he sold on the advice of the brokers 17 of these stocks, leaving his account then concentrated in 7 stocks, and that by the end of January, 1930, he had sold on the brokers\u2019 advice 4 of these 7 stocks, which left him at that time with his entire account concerntrated in three stocks, Brazilian, Nickel and Radio. No stocks were purchased by the appellant at any time after April, 1930, in which month he purchased on the advice of the brokers, he says, more Brazilian and more Radio. That was the state of the account when in July, 1930, the appellant says he definitely told the brokers to sell but was prevailed upon by their advice not to do so. The appellant now alleges that the advice then given him was tainted by a personal interest on the part of the brokers which they did not disclose to him and which was not at any time before bankruptcy known to him, this interest being that the brokers were personally involved (as a result of pools in which partners of the firm were largely concerned and which accounts were carried by the firm) in a liability of more than eight millions of dollars in the first two named stocks, Brazilian and Nickel. Statements of these pool accounts are shown at pages 238 and 239 of the case. The total figures in Brazilian at July 31, 1930, were $4,161,443.09, and in Nickel on the same date $4,159,273.30. The appellant points to the letter of July 16, 1930, from the brokers to himself, in which they suggest that he reduce his holdings by the sale of Radio, while silent as to Brazilian and Nickel, as a significant piece of evidence in support of his allegation against the brokers.\nThe respondent, on the other hand, says that the appellant was a competent business man of wide experience with large dealings during several years with other brokers as well as McDougall & Cowans, that he was very familiar with the stock market, its fluctuations and losses, and exercised at all times his own judgment. The respondent says that, when the appellant was told by McDougall & Cowans in January, 1929, that he could sell out with a profit of nearly $600,000 but preferred to stay in the market, he showed himself to be a man of highly speculative nature and one who did exactly what he wanted to do without reference to the advice of his brokers; that when in July, 1930, he says he told the brokers to sell, he only told them that (if he did) by way of a disgruntled acquiescence in their statement to him that if he did not put up more margin they would have to sell him out. The interpretation put upon his words by counsel for the respondent, without admitting that the words were used, is \u201cWell, sell me out\u2014if you insist upon it\u2014I can\u2019t give you the margin you say I must give you to prevent a sale.\u201d The respondent says that the appellant not only desired to stay in the market in July, 1930, for he had hopes it would right itself and he could save himself some of his losses, but that the subsequent deposits made by him to the credit of the account on July 26, 1930, October 4, 1930, and April 21, 1931, evidenced his desire to hold his stocks and prevent a forced sale of them on a rapidly falling market. The respondent treats the fact of the heavy obligations of the brokers in connection with the two stocks, Brazilian and Nickel, as evidence that the brokers had great confidence in these two stocks themselves or they would not have been involved in them to the extent they acknowledge they were and that when the brokers advised the appellant from time to time they gave him the same advice that they were acting upon themselves.\nIt would be useless to detail the mass of evidence given at the trial. Each story taken separately is in itself a convincing story, but when you hear both stories together you realize that the difficulty lies not so much on the facts as in the implications involved in, and the inferences to be drawn from, the proved facts. There is really very little substantial dispute as to the facts. The correspondence between the parties over a period of years, the circulars issued by the brokers from time to time and the different conversations related in the evidence are taken by the parties and interpreted from the different points of view. The difficulty in the case does not lie so much in the facts as in the inferences that may fairly and reasonably be drawn from them. The whole matter was left to the jury and on their answers to specific questions the learned trial judge entered judgment dismissing the action with costs.\nBearing in mind that the respondent sued for $148,484.13 as the balance of the account after all the stocks had been sold and the fact that the appellant swore definitely that in July, 1930, when the sale of his stocks would admittedly have left no debit balance, he told the brokers to sell but was prevailed upon to remain in the market, we turn to the questions and answers to the jury which were as follows:\nQ. 1 (a) Was there a lack of due skill and care on the part of McDougall & Cowans in handling defendant\u2019s accounts?\nA. Yes.\nQ. (b) If so, in what respect?\nA. In not selling stock when requested.\nQ. (c) If your answer to 1 (a) is in the affirmative, then state what loss, if any, the defendant suffered by lack of such care and skill?\nA. $148,000 or more.\nQ. 2. Was defendant to McDougall & Cowans\u2019 knowledge relying on the latter\u2019s advice as to buying and selling stocks?\nA. Yes.\nQ. 3. Was McDougall & Cowans\u2019 advice given to defendant, and their method of handling defendant\u2019s account, disinterested and in good faith?\nA. No.\nIt is to be observed that, while counsel for the appellant suggested a slightly different wording for the questions, counsel for the respondent took no objection whatever to the form of the questions though contending that the case should not be given to the jury.\nThe respondent appealed to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc. Written reasons for judgment were delivered[2]. Mr. Justice Graham did not see any sufficient grounds for setting aside the answers to sub-questions (a) and (b) of the first question. Reading them together he thought the jury found as they fairly might that there was lack of due care in not selling defendant\u2019s stock when told to do so. The answers to the second and third questions constituted, in his view, a defence to the action without any support from the answers to the first question. If the brokers in advising the defendant and in doing his business acted in bad faith against his interest, their conduct would be fraudulent and they ought not to recover. He thought the finding in answer to the second question, that the defendant acted upon the advice of the brokers, could not be set aside. As to the third question, he could not see how the jury could reasonably find that the brokers advised or acted dishonestly. The fact that the defendant accepted the situation when he found that the brokers had not sold his stock does not necessarily absolve them from liability for loss up till that time, but it prevents him from getting damages which accrued afterwards. The jury in fixing the damages at the amount claimed by the plaintiff and allocating it to a single negligent omission of the brokers, instead of to the general negligence which might be found to be disclosed, were probably confused by the form in which the questions were submitted. In his view, the answer to question 1 (c) as set down and allocated should be set aside. Upon the whole, however, Mr. Justice Graham thought the result of the trial to be unsatisfactory, and that it was a case in which the court in its discretion might properly order a new trial.\nMr. Justice Carroll took the view that the plaintiff could only succeed on the appeal if the answers to the questions submitted to the jury could not stand, and the answers could only be set aside if they were such answers as reasonable men could not reasonably find on the evidence. After briefly dealing with the evidence, he reached the conclusion that there was evidence which justified the jury making the answers which they did to questions 1 and 2. The answer to the third question presented some difficulties to Mr. Justice Carroll. He concluded that the proper and reasonable inference for a jury to draw from the evidence, especially where there was no explanation of the nondisclosure, was that the brokers were not disinterested in giving their advice to the defendant and in handling his account. Having regard to the relationship of the parties, he thought that the brokers had disqualified themselves from acting impartially, and that there was lacking that element of good faith which the law requires to be present throughout transactions of this kind. The brokers had withheld from the defendant the fact that they were interested in certain stocks, and that was equivalent to misrepresentation regarding a very essential and material fact. Mr. Justice Carroll did not see the reason for putting question 1 (c) to the jury. The defendant was not seeking damages but setting up a defence to the claim, and if the jury was justified upon the evidence to give the answers they did, then the defendant had made a good defence. He would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nMr. Justice Doull (with whom Mr. Justice Hall concurred) wrote a lengthy judgment reviewing the evidence, the judge\u2019s charge, the answers of the jury to the questions submitted, and discussed the authorities which he thought applicable to the facts. He dealt with one phase of the action which was again pressed before us but which I shall pass over for the moment, that is the question whether or not the brokers had been in a position to make delivery to the defendant of the shares in view of the evidence that these shares had been re-pledged by the brokers to their bankers. Dealing with the answers of the jury, he held that the answer to the first question should be set aside upon the ground that there was no foundation in the evidence of an order to sell, the failure to comply with which would give rise to an action for damages. Nor did the defendant regard the failure to sell as any breach of instructions, because he wrote on October 3, 1930, \u201cI certainly appreciate what you have done for me in carrying the burden through this period of depression,\u201d and sent a cheque for $4,000. In any case the defendant revoked any order he had given to sell, for within a few days after the alleged conversation, i.e., on July 26, 1930, he paid $5,000. These acts, in the view of Mr. Justice Doull, undoubtedly ratified the action of McDougall & Cowans in continuing the account. As to the answer to the second question, that the defendant to the knowledge of McDougall & Cowans was relying on the latter\u2019s advice as to buying and selling stocks, he thought that if the word \u201crelying\u201d meant that the defendant bought the stocks which he did buy and sold the stocks he did sell because of advice which the brokers gave him, there is evidence to support the finding, although there is a great deal of evidence to show that the defendant was always exercising his own judgment also. There is evidence that the defendant held on after the stocks had badly slumped because of the advice of Percy Cowans, one of the partners. Under the circumstances the defendant was entitled to have disinterested and bona fide advice. There was no evidence, however, that McDougall & Cowans were engaged as the defendant\u2019s \u201cconfidential adviser\u201d or that their relationship to him was different from that which existed between them and their other clients, and certainly no evidence whatever that they were to do the buying or selling without his orders. Then, as to whether or not the advice given was bona fide and disinterested\u2014There was ample evidence that the brokers knew that the defendant was acting, to some extent at any rate, on their advice. It was not in most cases advice given to him individually, and not advice which was paid for. Mr. Justice Doull did not think that any great fault should be found with the advice given by McDougall & Cowans as to buying, and that the defendant did not always follow the brokers\u2019 advice as to selling. He thought there was no evidence that the defendant followed their advice at all. He thought the advice given by Mr. Percy Cowans was reasonable advice. He could find no evidence of bad faith on the part of the brokers, and, while he thought it clear enough that the defendant could be successful in the absence of actual fraud or actual bad faith if the brokers were guilty of negligence under the circumstances of the relationship between the parties, he thought that the lack of due skill and care which the jury found to be \u201cnot selling stock when requested\u201d precluded the finding of negligence on other grounds. The jury having found as they did, he saw no necessity for sending the case back for another trial, and was of opinion that the defence had failed and that judgment should be entered for the plaintiff for the amount of its claim, which was, as above stated, $148,484.13 and interest.\nTo summarize these conclusions of the members of the Appeal Court\u2014Graham J. would order a new trial, Carroll J. would affirm the judgment dismissing the action, while Hall J. and Doull J. would set aside the findings and enter judgment for the amount of the plaintiff\u2019s claim.\nAfter the reasons for judgment of the members of the Appeal Court were given and filed, counsel for the respondent applied to the Court for a formal order allowing the respondent\u2019s appeal and giving judgment for the claimant with costs. The Court reserved judgment on that application and subsequently a supplementary judgment was given and filed in the following terms:\nThe opinion of the majority of the Court (Graham, J., dissenting) is that the effect of the judgment is that the appeal is allowed. Counsel for plaintiff intimated that he was willing that the amount of the claim should be reduced by $12,000 to meet the finding in the judgment of Graham, J.\nThe amount will be reduced accordingly.\nOn the same date the Court granted a formal order directing judgment for the plaintiff in the sum of $136,484.13 with interest. We are without the benefit of the explanation for this conclusion of the appeal, in view of the written reasons for judgment of the several members of the Court. But it is from the judgment of the Court and not from the reasons that an appeal lies.\nThe defendant appeals. Counsel on each side reviewed the evidence in careful detail, drawing different inferences and finding different implications from the same facts. It must be plain, however, that it was the peculiar function of the jury on the whole evidence to reach their own conclusions, and if there is evidence to support their answers, they must stand.\nI now turn to a consideration of the evidence that may be regarded as the basis of the jury\u2019s answers. The appellant swore definitely that he told Peebles, the Halifax manager of McDougall & Cowans, in the middle of July, 1930, to sell out his stocks. On July 5, 1930, the appellant remitted to the brokers $10,055.91. On July 16, 1930, Peebles wrote the appellant:\nThe anticipated check on my extension to you of the privilege of holding your stocks without marginal protection, came to-day.\nI am directed to state when full margin may be expected on your account. It is suggested that the firm has handled your account very generously through the depression. I am told that 7,000 shares of stock is more than we can reasonably be expected to carry for any account, without marginal protection.\nThey ask that if you are unable to finance the account further, now you will reduce your holdings, on this rally, which in the case of Radio is nearly ten points.\nKindly let me have your decision at your earliest convenience, as I am required to present my report to the head of the firm.\nAt this time, on the basis of thirty per cent. marginal requirements, the account stood with $62,000 shortage of margin, and the appellant\u2019s equity was $10,494.59. The appellant says that in July, 1930, Peebles began to call him up quite often. The appellant swore:\n* * * I could not put up much more; I was pretty well exhausted financially * * * when he called up that time I told him he would have to sell the account, and told him to sell it. * * * When I told him to sell the account out that day, there was not much more said after I told him to sell out, that I could not put up any more, and the conversation ended. The receiver was hung up. Very shortly afterwards, I got another call saying it was too bad to sell the stocks now, as they thought they would soon come back *\u2019 * * He said he thought I should do something as it would only be in my favour to try and help the account out. I told him I didn\u2019t like the idea, but at the same time I would think the matter over, and I think I went down to Halifax after that and talked the matter over, and he advised me to try and put up some more and hold the account.\nThe appellant fixes the date of the receipt of the letter of July 16, 1930, as the time Peebles called him up for more money, and he told him,\n\u201cI cannot give you any more\u201d\u2014I told him to sell me out.\nOn cross-examination as to the payment of $5,000 on July 26, 1930, the appellant swore that Peebles\nkept calling me and said I had better hang on and probably it would work out for me the best by supporting the account some and I did not like it. I said I didn\u2019t like it. However, I later on agreed to do what I could. I said I will do what I can, I will do my best for you, I will try and get you some more; I don\u2019t know how I got it, through the bank or somehow, but I got it for them.\nThe appellant\u2019s son, Don Glennie, swore that he heard his father tell Peebles to sell out, and fixes the conversation between the middle and the latter part of July, 1930.\nPeebles, recalled in rebuttal and examined in chief, swore he never received any instructions from Glennie to sell his account, but in the cross-examination he gives the following evidence:\nQ. Am I correct in assuming that it is quite possible that there may have been discussions with Mr. Glennie with regard to selling?\nA. Yes, he spoke about it very often.\nQ. And you discussed it with him?\nA. Yes, sir.\nQ. And it is possible that in those conversations he may have said, I guess the best thing for me to do is to sell out?\nA. He may have suggested that.\nSome argument was directed to us on the assumption that there was difficulty in understanding exactly what the jury meant in their answer to the first question\u2014\u201dIn not selling stock when requested.\u201d It was contended that \u201crequested\u201d was not a word of instruction or direction, and was something different from a finding that the appellant had \u201cordered\u201d the brokers to sell. I do not think that any such distinction can be made. The learned trial judge in his charge to the jury used the word \u201crequested\u201d in discussing the sale of stocks by a broker when under-margined, and that may account for the jury using the word. In any case the word is more than one of assent, and the jury in effect found that the customer told the brokers to sell his stocks and that they did not do so.\nCounsel for the respondent argues that even if that finding is well founded, the appellant subsequently cancelled his request, put up more moneys and endeavoured as best he could to avoid liquidation of his stocks on the falling market. There can be no doubt that he did, but that does not answer the appellant\u2019s charge that he did so at the insistence of the brokers and upon their advice, and that this advice was neither disinterested nor in good faith, in that the brokers were themselves involved in liabilty at the time in Brazilian and Nickel to the extent of over eight million dollars as mentioned above; and that when the brokers undertook to advise him not to sell, they should have disclosed to him their personal interest in the two stocks in question.\nIt is contended by the appellant that from July, 1930, onwards there was a consistent and continuous policy or system on the part of the brokers to advise their customers, and in particular the appellant, not to sell out Brazilian and Nickel, and that this policy was prompted by the very heavy interest of the brokers in these two stocks. There is no explicit evidence of this, and the question is whether or not it may be fairly and reasonably inferred from the evidence. There is a letter of August 28, 1930, from the brokers to the appellant stating that it is imperative that they have further support for his account in view of the continuing weakness in the Canadian market.\nIf you decide to hold your present stocks, it will be necessary to make a further deposit in your account. If this is not possible at the present time, a reduction of 1,000 shares will be accepted, as a temporary reduction. This has been decided on by the firm, but we will wait a reasonable time for your instructions.\nThe respondent emphasizes the suggested reduction of 1,000 shares in the account, and the appellant emphasizes the statement of the necessity to make a further deposit in the account. This letter is rather typical of all the correspondence in that counsel find different implications and draw different inferences from the same letter. Then on September 6, 1930, the Halifax office of the brokers sent to the appellant, as they did to their customers generally, a circular letter. In this circular the brokers said that the reports from Montreal and New York indicated that the turning movement predicted for the stock market was then in progress, and stated that, while financial statements for the third quarter of the year were discouraging and financial publications for the most part pessimistic, the situation in 1921 was almost parallel and writings almost identical with the market conditions and financial literature at the time of the circular, and that there followed during the seven years after 1921 the greatest market in history. The brokers then expressed their attitude on the high grade stocks, which, in their judgment, would make outstanding progress if bought around current prices and held for the better times. Particular reference was made in this circular to Brazilian and Nickel. As to Brazilian, the circular concludes:\nDuring the present year there should be another surplus to strengthen the equity behind the common stock.\nand as to Nickel:\n* * * we believe this company is only on the threshold of its career.\nThe closing paragraph of the circular states:\nOur recommendations also include Dominion Bridge and Shawinigan Water & Power Co., all of which we believe will sell much higher, subject of course to market fluctuations.\nThen on September 25, 1930, Peebles writes to the appellant expressing regret at the pressure he is compelled to put on the appellant \u201cto strengthen your account\u201d\u2014\n* * * with conditions as they are I am afraid every day that my chief will sell your account out and if he decides on that, there is no appeal. The idea of carrying about 6,000 shares of stock for any client without margin is unheard of and there is no protection in your account at present prices.\nWe were given to understand that you would turn over some funds in August. The fact that nothing came was very embarrassing to me. I have now reported that you expect to make a deposit the first of October.\n* * *\nIf you are not able to raise more funds to support your holdings, it looks as if some of them will have to go at a very bad time. Please keep me posted on your prospects.\nThen on October 3, 1930, the appellant writes to the brokers enclosing his cheque for $4,000, and says:\nI certainly appreciate what you have done for me in carrying the burden, through this period of depression, and I always want you to feel that I am trying to do my best to help out. As I get hold of some payments due me I will send you further amounts, and try to hold down until the market improves.\nThat letter is taken by the respondent as evidence that the appellant was hanging on to his stocks at his own free will, and inconsistent with his position in this action that he was over-reached by the brokers and persuaded by them to remain in the market. The appellant, on the other hand, contends that the letter must be read in the light of the non-disclosure to him by the brokers of their substantial personal and adverse interest in the particular stocks held by him.\nOn October 6, 1930, Peebles writes the appellant as follows:\nMy head office to-day notified me by wire that they would require a substantial liquidation of your debit balance. The conditions under which we are labouring to-day being so full of uncertainties that the loan in your account is considered unsafe.\nYour account requires to-day fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) protection and we are unable to carry the account without a substantial deposit as protection.\nAt that time the sale of the stocks would have involved a loss to the appellant of approximately $100,000. Obviously alarmed with the situation, he went to Montreal and interviewed Mr. Percy Cowans, one of the senior partners of the firm of brokers, on October 9, 1930. I take the following from the direct examination of the appellant at the trial with reference to this interview:\nQ. Tell us the substance of the conversation you had with him?\nA. I told him I had come to see him about this account. I told him, had the account been sold out as I directed in July it would have been much better for me, I would not be where I was now; it had shrunk off quite a lot. I told him that I didn\u2019t know much about these stocks, I relied on them entirely for information to keep me posted, and I took their advice from the time I started the account to where it was now; and he told me, he said you have good stocks, Mr. Glennie, don\u2019t be afraid of those stocks; those stocks, he said, will go higher. He said, I will tell you right now Brazilian will go to $100 per share. He said, as regards Nickel, he said I have been up over the International Nickel plant many times; I know it, he says, all over, I have been through it and I know its resources, and I know what it can make. He took his pencil, and on the counter, right on his desk, and figured up to me what great resources there were in Nickel and what great prospects and what great paying power it had. He said Nickel will go to $100, and he said Brazilian will do the same; and he said I will carry those stocks for you until they come back, because I know what I am talking about when I am telling you about these stocks.\nQ. What did you say to that?\nA. I said I don\u2019t know; I would rely on what he said. He said if you can give us any assistance to help us along it will be much better, but he said I will carry the stocks for you because I know they will come back.\nQ. Now at that time you discussed with him a proposition about the bank, about some stocks the bank were carrying?\nA. I told him I had some stocks held by the Bank of Montreal; that I owed them an account there. Q. Yes, go ahead.\nA. I told him that the stocks I held would pay off both him and the bank as near as I could tell, and I thought I could get the bank to release the stock provided they paid my account off; so he asked me to go to the bank and get a list of the stock, and I went to the Bank of Montreal in Montreal and got the manager to take a list of the stocks off, and I brought them to Mr. Cowans and he took a list off in his office. He said, these are all good stocks, Mr. Glennie, and it is a shame to sell them now, they will everyone come back. He said, did the bank question you, and I said not at all, but I thought I would hand them over to you and clean up both accounts.\nQ. What do you mean by that?\nA. Clean his account off, and the bank\u2019s both.\nQ. You mean by selling the stock?\nA. Yes. He said, no, sir, I will not press you for my account, I will carry it for you, and he said take them back to the bank and hand them back to them for I don\u2019t want them, or he said they could keep the stock.\nQ. What did you say to that, what was your decision and what did you say?\nA. Well, I took him at his word and told him I would rely on his advice entirely.\nIn cross-examination upon this interview the appellant repeats substantially the same statement. In October, 1930, Brazilian was selling at $25, and Nickel at $17.\nMr. Cowans was not called as a witness at the trial, and no explanation is offered for his not being called. The evidence of the appellant as to that interview was uncontradicted. The jury may have thought it significant that no further deposit was made by the appellant except a payment of $500 on April 21 of the next year, 1931.\nOn February 5, 1931, Peebles wrote to the appellant as follows:\nNot having heard from you since your last visit to Halifax, we are writing to let you know that head office is constantly inquiring as to when we may expect a payment on account from you. While we may hold your stock for some time at present prices, the future chances of holding your account depends, of course, upon the assistance you give us in supporting your stocks in the meantime.\nAnd again on February 18, 1931, Peebles wrote to the appellant as follows:\nThe head office is making constant demands upon me for some action on your account, as the absence of any deposits whatever since last fall is creating a very unfortunate impression. I trust that you will be able to make a deposit shortly as I feel that anything you get now would be greatly to your advantage.\nPeebles admitted that his firm were advising the holding of Brazilian and Nickel in 1931, based on Mr. Cowans\u2019 opinion very largely, and that he did not know when advising the appellant that partners of his firm with others were interested in Brazilian and Nickel to the extent of millions of dollars in accounts carried by the firm, as disclosed at the trial.\nOn November 7, 1930, the brokers sold out all the Radio. The loss represented by the difference between the cost and the amount realized on Radio was $50,090.50. The appellant was then entirely in Brazilian and Nickel.\nOn May 19, 1931, the brokers sold 1,000 shares of Brazilian at 13\u215e. In April, 1930, these shares had cost 50 to 54. On the same day they sold 1,000 Nickel at 12. The last 1,000 shares of Nickel had been bought on January 28, 1929, at 68.\nOn May 28, 1931, Peebles wrote the appellant asking for $10,000 as margin.\nOn September 24, 1931, the bankers of the brokers sold all the then remaining stocks of the appellant\u2014at least the brokers treated part of the shares pledged by them to and sold by the bank on that day as his shares. Mr. Russell Cowans deposed to the sales by their bankers during the month of September, 1931, and stated that\nthe proceeds of such sales were apportioned pro rata by McDougall & Cowans to the accounts of those clients who were under the market, and as a result of this apportionment the account of the said T. C. Glennie was credited with the sale price of 560 shares of International Nickel;\nand similarly with the sale price of 2,721 shares of Brazilian, which entries appear in the appellant\u2019s account of September 28, 1931, and September 26, 1931, respectively. The bankruptcy of the brokers then ensued on October 5, 1931.\nIt is easy to draw inferences and the court must guard against inferences being drawn that cannot fairly and reasonably be drawn from the evidence, but I think the jury were entitled upon the evidence in this case to make the findings they did. Counsel for the respondent urged upon us that the different questions and answers must be separated and considered singly, and from that point of view he argued, having regard to the charge of the learned trial judge, that all the findings of negligence must be taken to be contained in the answer to question 1, and that the answer to question 3 negatived negligence. But in a complicated case such as this, if the trial judge in his discretion thinks it a fit case for a jury and leaves the whole case to the jury as was done here, we must read the questions and answers together as far as practicable to ascertain the true meaning and effect of the jury\u2019s findings. Treated in that manner and having regard to the evidence, I think the jury\u2019s answers clearly indicate that they accepted the appellant\u2019s evidence that he told the brokers to sell him out in July, 1930, at which time it was admitted a sale would have left him without any debit balance; that he was advised by the brokers against taking this course; that he acted upon their advice, which was \u201cnot disinterested and in good faith\u201d; that in consequence thereof he ended his speculations with a loss in his account of $148,484.13. That, I think, is a fair interpretation of the jury\u2019s answers, and, while a jury might well have taken a contrary view of the evidence, there was evidence which, if believed, was sufficient to support the findings.\nIn considering the answer to question 3, we should recall the language of the learned trial judge in submitting that question to the jury:\nIn a word, what defendant says is that there came a time in the negotiations when McDougall & Cowans were acting dishonestly with him; that they were acting in bad faith. Now if you find that McDougall & Cowans were acting in bad faith, you will answer that question \u201cYes,\u201d but let me suggest to you that when you are considering that question you ought to be able to say just at what time this bad faith began; when did McDougall & Cowans commence (to use a somewhat slang expression) to put one over on the defendant? Not when they bought the stocks for the defendant. Not during the whole of 1927 and 1928, and up to the time in 1929 when this defendant had a clear profit of five or six hundred thousand dollars. There was no talk about bad faith then, although during that time McDougall & Cowans held large quantities of Brazilian and International Nickel.\n* * *\nIn deciding that question of bad faith you can hardly base your finding on any one particular fact in the case, but you must review the transactions between the parties, it seems to me, from beginning to end.\nThe respondent contends in any event that the appellant subsequently to July, 1930, acquiesced in the suggested concellation of his order to sell and waived his request, relying upon the subsequent marginal deposits made by the appellant: July 26, $5,000; October 4, $4,000; April 21, 1931, $500; and that the damages, if any, should have been assessed at the difference in the value of the stocks between the date of the alleged breach of duty in not selling and the date of the alleged waiver\u2014a difference of only a few thousand dollars, apparently covered by the respondent\u2019s consent in the Court of Appeal to a reduction of $12,000. But having regard to the evidence of the appellant of the advice he was given by Peebles in July, 1930, and to the uncontradicted evidence of the appellant of the statements made and advice given to him by Mr. Percy Cowans in Montreal on October 9, 1930, and to the letters and circular from the brokers to the appellant subsequently to the middle of July, 1930, the jury was entitled to reach the conclusion that the appellant\u2019s course of conduct from and after his request to the brokers to sell in July, 1930, was predicated upon the advice of the brokers. The jury\u2019s findings read as a whole indicate that such was the conclusion they reached. The inference the jury drew, it seems to me, was that the subsequent demands, either to liquidate or to put up further margins, were intended to draw out more money from the appellant to support his account rather than to induce the sale of the stocks. That is an inference which I think the jury could very properly draw from the evidence, and, taken with the fact of the non-disclosure at all times of the liability of the brokers to the extent of some eight millions of dollars in Brazilian and Nickel, justifies the conclusion of the jury that the advice given to the appellant was not disinterested and in good faith, and induced the appellant to remain in the market and resulted in the ultimate loss.\nThe case presents some serious difficulties quite apart from the findings of the jury. One difficulty is whether or not the plea of the appellant was as a matter of law a defence to the claim. The claim is put as the balance due in respect of moneys paid in the purchase of stocks, shares and securities and for brokerage commissions, interest, etc. The appellant admitted the correctness of the accounts.\nThe respondent contends that the appellant\u2019s claim for damages for breach of duty is not a defence in law to the claim but a matter for cross-action. The defence has been dealt with throughout, however, as a proper subject matter by way of defence in whole or in part to the claim. It is always desirable to avoid circuity of action which would result from compelling the defendant to pay the amount of the claim and leaving him to cross-action. Substantially it was one transaction between broker and customer and the damages alleged arose, if at all, out of negligence or breach of duty by the brokers in connection with the transaction. We cannot give effect to this objection of the respondent as to the form of the action and defence.\nA more serious difficulty that presents itself is the absence of an explicit finding of the causal relation between the alleged negligence or breach of duty and the damages assessed. The form of the questions submitted to the jury was not as precise as might be desired but, substantially, the answers, taken as a whole, indicate that the jury, treating negligence broadly as a breach of duty, have ascribed the appellant\u2019s loss to the extent of the amount of the debit balance sued upon, to the advice given by the brokers to the appellant.\nDuring the argument the nature and extent of the rights and obligations of brokers to their customers were broadly discussed by counsel but it is unnecessary for us in this case to attempt to lay down any general statement. The customer here requested the brokers to sell. The brokers undertook to advise the customer at that time not to sell, for that must be involved in the findings of the jury. Having so undertaken to advise, the brokers undoubtedly owed a duty to their customer to advise fully, honestly and in good faith, and the non-disclosure to the customer of their own substantial interest in the stocks that he was carrying and wanted to sell was a breach of duty for which the brokers were liable for any damages suffered by the customer in consequence of that breach of duty. There is no evidence that the appellant would have taken a different course had disclosure been made to him, but once the interest was shown to exist, the burden rested upon the respondent to exonerate the brokers and establish that the advice given and the mode of handling the account was not affected by the brokers\u2019 very large interest in the pools. The fullest and clearest explanation for the non-disclosure rested upon the respondent and no attempt was made to give any explanation.\nI therefore think that the judgment directed to be entered by the learned trial judge dismissing the action ought to be restored with costs throughout.\nIt is unnecessary, in the view I take of this appeal, to consider the question raised by counsel for the appellant at the trial and again on the appeal in the court below and much stressed by him before us, that the respondent could not succeed in the action in any case because it had not established that McDougall & Cowans were in a position at all material times to deliver the stocks to the customer had he tendered payment of the balance of his account. It was contended that the stocks when purchased had been pledged by the brokers to their bankers to such an extent as to deprive the brokers of a compellable title to the particular stocks purchased for the appellant. I should like to say that, without further consideration of this aspect of the case, I should not want to be taken as in agreement with the views expressed on this question in the court below.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J.

The charge of fraud was sustained by that judgment, and the land was vested in the prosecutors respondents subject to the mortgage, and the judgment further pro- vided for a reference to the district registrar to ascertain the amount received by the wrongdoers under the mortgage and also rents and profits and that the prosecutors recover \"the sum found due on the taking of such account.\" A certificate of the district registrar on the reference directed by the judgment was dated November 22, 1933. This amount having been so fixed at a sum of $34,730.95, the district registrar, without making any further application to the court, entered judgment on December 30, 1933. Writs of execution having been issued on such judgment and returns of nulla bona made thereto, a demand was made upon the Minister of Finance pursuant to section 218 of the Land Registry Act, for payment of the amount of the judgment out of the assurance fund provided for by the Act. This demand being refused, the prosecutors obtained from D. A. McDonald J. an order for a writ of mandamus commanding him to pay. The Court of Appeal held that the order had been properly made under sections 216 and 218 of the Act.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal ([1935] 1 W.W.R. 113), that, upon the facts and circumstances of this case, the Minister of Finance was entitled to refuse the demand made upon him and that a writ of mandamus should not have been issued to compel him to pay to the respondents the sum demanded, or in fact any other sum. Upon the analysis of this case, this Court could not ascertain what if any damages were in fact sustained in consequence of the fraudulent registration; and it was precisely in order to avoid questions of fact such as have been raised in the present proceedings that the Land Registry Act expressly provides that the certificate of the Court shewing an award of damages, in an action between the lawful owner and the wrongdoer, is a necessary foundation to a proper claim against the Minister of Finance under section 218 of the Act. The alternative would be that this Court would resettle for the Minister the statement of the damages, if any, sustained by the person wrongfully deprived of land in consequence of a fraudulent registration by another person; and the words of the statute completely negative the right of any further tribunal to review the decision in the action.\nHeld, also, that in a proper case a mandamus lies against the Minister of Finance to compel payment out of the assurance fund when there is no suggestion that the fund itself is not sufficient to meet the claim without resort to any moneys of the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Distinction must be made between a Minister acting as a servant of the Crown and acting as a mere agent of the legislature to do a particular act. Under the provisions of the statute, a particular fund is established by the legislature and created by the setting aside of a certain proportion of the fees paid by persons registering documents under the Land Registry Act so that a fund may be available to compensate those persons who have registered their documents and become deprived of their land or some interest therein in consequence of some fraud by other persons in procuring registration of documents under the Act. The fund is not public money of the Crown but the Minister of Finance for the province has been designated by the legislature to pay out of that fund damages sustained by those persons, upon proof by certificate of the court of certain conditions prescribed by the statute. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia[1], affirming the order of D. A.McDonald J., whereby he ordered that a peremptory writ of mandamus should issue commanding the appellant to pay to the prosecutors respondents the sum of $34,730.95 damages and $381.95 costs, and to charge the same to the account of the Assurance Fund provided by the Land Registry Act R.S.B.C. 1924, chapter 127.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nC. W. Craig K.C. for the appellant.\nAlfred Bull K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nDavis J.\u2014This appeal arises out of proceedings by way of mandamus instituted by the respondents, who alleged that they were wrongfully deprived of certain land or an interest therein situate in Victoria, B.C., in consequence of fraud in the registration of a certain deed of conveyance, against the Minister of Finance of the province of British Columbia, to compel payment of the amount of their damages by him out of the Assurance Fund under the Land Registry Act, R.S.B.C. 1924, c. 127.\nUnder the terms of an agreement of purchase and sale of the lands in question, the deed of conveyance was put in escrow to be taken up by the purchaser upon payment of the purchase price. The respondents as vendors alleged that the purchaser fraudulently obtained possession of the deed without payment of any of the purchase price, registered the same under the provisions of the Land Registry Act and then raised money upon the property by way of mortgage. The deed of conveyance was dated September 25, 1925, and was registered October 13, 1925. The $30,000 mortgage to which we shall later refer was registered on May 13, 1926, and the respondents' action to set aside the registration of the deed of conveyance and to revest the property in them was commenced April 8, 1927. The judgment in the action in favour of the respondents as plain- tiffs was delivered October 27, 1933, the certificate of the district registrar on the reference directed by the judgment was dated November 22, 1933, and the final judgment, dated December 30, 1933, adjudged that the respondents as plaintiffs recover against the defendants in the action who were responsible for the fraud the sum of $34,730.95 and costs. The defendants in the action appealed but they subsequently abandoned their appeal and it was formally dismissed by the Court of Appeal of British Columbia on March 7, 1934. A return of nulla bona having been made by the sheriff to a writ of fieri facias, the respondents on March 21, 1934, demanded payment from the Minister of Finance under the provisions of s. 218 of the Land Registry Act of the amount due on the said judgment, $34,730.95 and certain costs. The Minister refused to comply with the demand and the respondents then on April 18, 1934, moved for an order directing that a writ of mandamus do issue directed to the Minister of Finance commanding him to pay the respondents the above amounts awarded by the judgment in the action to which we have referred. The Minister had by notice of motion dated April 9, 1934, made application to the Chief Justice of British Columbia for leave to intervene in the said action and for an extension of time within which to appeal from the judgment in the action but this application was dismissed on April 13, 1934. Mr. Justice D. A. McDonald on May 3, 1934, in the proceedings instituted by the respondents against the Minister granted an order directing a peremptory writ of mandamus to issue directed to the Minister commanding him to pay to the respondents the amount of damages and costs\u2014namely, $34,730.95 damages and $381.95 costs\u2014awarded by judgment in the said action. The Minister appealed to the Court of Appeal of British Columbia[2], which court dismissed the appeal on October 2, 1934, Martin and McPhillips, JJ., dissenting. The Minister now appeals to this Court.\nBefore entering upon a discussion of the particular facts of the case, we should review briefly the legislation of the province of British Columbia respecting the creation and maintenance of the Assurance Fund under the Land Registry Act of that province. The fund appears to have been first created by s. 14 of the Land Registry Act, c. 29 of the statutes of British Columbia of 1898, which section became s. 136 of the Revised Statutes of 1911, c. 127, and read as follows:\n136. The Assurance Fund shall be formed by deducting from the amount of fees received by the registrar after the thirtieth day of June, 1898, for the purposes of the Land Registry Act the amount of twenty per centum per annum, and accumulating the same with interest thereon until the fund shall reach the sum of fifty thousand dollars, after which the twenty per cent shall not be deducted unless at any time the fund shall be diminished by payment, when the addition to it of a like sum of twenty per cent shall be resumed until the fund shall again reach the amount of fifty thousand dollars, and so on in perpetuity; and all sums of money so received and deducted, together with all interest and profits which may have accrued thereon, shall from time to time be invested by the Minister of Finance and Agriculture in such securities as may from time to time be approved of by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council for the purposes herein provided.\nOther sections of the 1911 Act to which reference should be made are secs. 127 and 174, which read as follows:\n127. The Minister of Finance and Agriculture shall pay the amount of any judgment obtained, payable out of the Assurance Fund, notwithstanding that there may not be a sufficient sum to the credit of the Assurance Fund.\n174. There shall be paid to the registrar, in respect of the several matters mentioned in the Third Schedule hereto, the several fees therein specified or such other fees as the Lieutenant-Governor in Council may from time to time by Order direct; and all fees paid to the registrar pursuant to this Act shall be paid into the Provincial Treasury, and shall, less twenty per cent thereof, which is to be placed to the credit of the Assurance Fund, while the amount to the credit of same does not exceed the sum of fifty thousand dollars, be carried to the Consolidated Revenue Fund.\nThe Act of 1911 and subsequent amendments were repealed by the Land Registry Act, being c. 26 of the 1921 statutes. The Assurance Fund was continued by s. 228 which is now s. 228 of the Revised Statutes of 1924, c. 127, and reads as follows:\n228. The Assurance Fund of fifty thousand dollars existing on the thirty-first day of May, 1921, under the Acts repealed by chapter 26 of the statutes of 1921 shall be continued for the purposes of this Act, and together with all interest and profits which have accrued or accrue thereon shall from time to time be invested by the Minister of Finance in securities approved by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council. If at any time the Assurance Fund is reduced to an amount below the sum of fifty thousand dollars by the payment of claims, it shall again be brought up to that sum by deducting one-fifth of all fees received by the registrars and adding the amounts so deducted to the fund.\nSection 127 of the 1911 Act remains the same in the present Act as s. 220. Section 174 in amended form is now s. 254. It is to be observed then that the Assurance Fund was created by setting aside a portion of the registration fees collected under the Land Registry Act until the sum of $50,000 was reached, the balance of the fees collected being paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Provision was made that if the Assurance Fund should become reduced below $50,000, a certain portion of the registration fees should again be set apart to reimburse the fund and in so far as the fund might be insufficient at any time to meet the lawful claims upon it, what is in effect a loan from the Consolidated Revenue Fund is made available to bring the fund up to the fixed amount.\nFor the purpose of these proceedings it may be assumed that the Assurance Fund was at the time of the demand and refusal of payment thereout of the amount claimed sufficient without any encroachment upon the Consolidated Revenue Fund, for it appears to have been stated by counsel for the respondents on the hearing for the issue of the writ of mandamus and not challenged by counsel for the Minister that the Assurance Fund at the time in fact exceeded the sum of $140,000.\nWe may now turn to the provisions of the Land Registry Act governing the rights of persons who are wrongfully deprived of their land in consequence of fraud in the registration of documents under the Act. The relevant sections of the Land Registry Act (R.S.B.C. 1924, c. 127) read as follows:\n216. Any person wrongfully deprived of land, or any estate or interest in land, in consequence of fraud or misrepresentation in the registration of any other person as owner of such land, estate or interest, or in consequence of any error, omission, or misdescription in any certificate of title, or in any entry in the register may bring and prosecute an action at law for the recovery of damages against the person by whose fraud, error, omission, mispresentation, misdescription, or wrongful act such person has been deprived of his land, or of his estate or interest therein. The bringing or prosecuting of an action as aforesaid shall not prevent proceedings being taken against the registrar in respect of any loss or damage not recovered in such action: Provided that no action shall in such case be brought against the registrar without first proceeding as above provided unless authorized by the fiat of the Attorney-General.\n217. Nothing in this Act contained shall be so interpreted as to leave subject to action for recovery of damages as aforesaid, or to action of ejectment, or to deprivation of the estate or interest in respect of which he is registered as owner, any purchaser or mortgagee bona fide for valuable consideration of land, on the plea that his vendor or mortgagor may have been registered as proprietor through fraud or error, or may have derived from or through a person registered as owner through fraud or error; and this whether such fraud or error shall consist in wrong description of the boundaries or of the parcels of any land, or otherwise howsoever.\n218. In case the person against whom such action for damages may be brought as aforesaid shall be dead, or cannot be found within the province, then in such case it shall be lawful to bring such action for damages against the registrar as nominal defendant for the purpose of recovering the amount of the said damages and costs against the Assurance Fund; and in any such case, if final judgment be recovered, and also in any case in which damages may be awarded in any action as aforesaid, and the sheriff shall make a return nulla bona, or shall certify that the full amount, with costs awarded, cannot be recovered from such person, the Minister of Finance, upon receipt of a certificate of the Court, shall pay the amount of such damages and costs as may be awarded, or the unrecovered balance thereof, as the case may be, and charge the same to the account of the Assurance Fund.\n226. In any case where it appears that the Assurance Fund is clearly liable for any loss or damage to any person under any of the provisions of this Act, and where it appears that the claim for loss or damage is a fair and reasonable one, the Minister of Finance may, without an action being first brought, pay the amount of any such claim: Provided that no such claim shall be paid unless the Minister of Finance is authorized to do so by the reports, advising such payment, of the Attorney-General and the registrar of the district in which the land which is the subject of such claim lies or is registered.\nThe statute requires that the respondents shew that they were wrongfully deprived of land or of any estate or interest in land in consequence of fraud in the registration of some other person as owner of such land, estate or interest and that they recovered damages in an action at law brought and prosecuted by them against the person by whose fraud they were deprived of their land or of some estate or interest therein, and that the sheriff has made a return of nulla bona. Upon receipt of a certificate of the court, the Minister of Finance shall pay the amount of such damages and costs as may be awarded, or the unrecovered balance thereof as the case may be, and charge the same to the account of the Assurance Fund.\nCounsel for the appellant contends at the outset that proceedings by way of mandamus do not lie against the Minister of Finance in respect of the claim in question upon the ground that the Minister of Finance is a servant of the Crown and as such is not amenable to the ordinary process of the courts. Reliance is put upon the words of Cockburn, C.J., in The Queen v. Lords Commissioners of the Treasury[3]: I take it, with reference to that jurisdiction, we must start with this unquestionable principle, that when a duty has to be performed (if I may use that expression) by the Crown, this Court cannot claim even in appearance to have any power to command the Crown; the thing is out of the question. Over the sovereign we can have no power. In like manner where the parties are acting as servants of the Crown, and are amenable to the Crown, whose servants they are, they are not amenable to us in the exercise of our prerogative jurisdiction.\nand upon the words of Lush, J., at p. 402 of the same case:\nWhen the money gets to the hands of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, who are responsible for dispensing it, it is in their hands as servants or agents of the Crown, and they are accountable theoretically to the Crown, but practically to the House of Commons, and in no sense are they accountable to this or any other Court of Justice.\nIf the Minister of Finance was acting as a servant of the Crown in discharging his duties with reference to the Assurance Fund there can be no doubt that he would not be subject to a writ of mandamus to compel him to pay the respondents out of that fund, for it is beyond question that a mandamus cannot be directed to the Crown or any servant of the Crown simply acting in his capacity of servant. As Lord Esher, M.R., said in The Queen v. The Secretary of State for War[4]:\nAssuming that the Crown were under any obligation to make this allowance to the claimant, a mandamus would not lie against the Secretary of State, because his position is merely that of agent for the Crown, and he is only liable to answer to the Crown whether he has obeyed the terms of his agency or not: he has no legal duty as such agent towards any individual.\nBut a classic statement of the distinction between a Minister acting as a servant of the Crown and acting as a mere agent of the legislature to do a particular act is that of Sir George Jessel when counsel in The Queen v. The Lords Commissioners of the Treasury case[5]:\nWhere the legislature has constituted the Lords of the Treasury agents to do a particular act, in that case a mandamus might lie against them as mere individuals designated to do that act; but in the present case, the money is in the hands of the Crown or of the Lords of the Treasury as ministers of the Crown; in no case can the Crown be sued even by writ of right. If the Court granted a mandamus, they would be interfering with the distribution of public money; for the applicants do not shew that the money is in the hands of the Lords of the Treasury to be dealt with in a particular manner.\nHere we have a particular fund established by the legislature and created by the setting aside of a certain proportion of the fees paid by persons registering documents under the Land Registry Act so that a fund may be available to compensate those persons who have registered their documents and become deprived of their land or some interest therein in consequence of some fraud by other persons in procuring registration of documents under the Act. The fund is not public money of the Crown but the Minister of Finance for the province has been designated by the legislature to pay out of that fund damages sustained by persons who have been wrongfully deprived of their land in consequence of fraudulent registrations, upon proof by certificate of the court of certain conditions prescribed by the statute. We are of opinion that in a proper case a mandamus lies against the Minister to compel payment out of the fund when as here there is no suggestion that the fund itself is not sufficient to meet the claim without resort to any moneys of the Consolidated Revenue Fund.\nBut counsel for the Minister takes the position that even if mandamus lies in a proper case, there has been in this case no action at law in which damages have been awarded. Taking the pleadings in the action and judgment therein it was, he submits, plainly an action for a declaration that a deed of conveyance was fraudulently registered and for an order setting aside the same and for an account of the rents and profits and of any payments made under the contract of purchase and sale and not a common law action for damages. The statutory obligation of the Minister to pay is upon an award of damages by the court in an action. Upon the very face of the record of the action no damages, strictly speaking, were either sought or awarded. I confess to have been much impressed by this argument during the hearing but upon reflection I have concluded that if the substantial effect of the judgment in the action was the establishment of the amount of the damages actually suffered by the respondents in consequence of the fraudulent registration, we should not allow the form of the action or judgment to becloud the real substance of the matter.\nThat brings us to a consideration of the judgment in the action in an effort to ascertain what if any damages were in fact established. The lands were by the judgment revested in the respondents but subject to the $30,000 mortgage that had been charged against them. No ques- tion is raised as to the bona fides of that mortgage in the hands of innocent third parties, and though the value of the lands was not proved except in so far as the contract of purchase and sale fixed the price at $55,000 on terms of payment of $10,000 in cash and the balance by a promissory note to be secured by a mortgage on properties in California, we may reasonably infer, I think, that the lands were worth at least the amount of the mortgage. It was proved that the amount of the mortgage was actually received by the parties who committed the fraud. If the fact of the $30,000 mortgage stood alone, we might not feel much difficulty in dealing with the matter on the basis that the damages were the amount of the mortgage with which the respondents found their property charged upon its return to them by the vesting order of the court made in the action. But the judgment directed a reference as to payments made upon the contract of purchase and sale and as to the rents and profits and these, together with the $30,000 mortgage, were respectively debited and credited in arriving at the final sum of $34,730.95 for which, with certain costs, the respondents demanded payment from the Minister out of the Assurance Fund as damages awarded to them for the wrongful deprivation of their property or some interest therein in consequence of the fraudulent registration. Now it is to be observed that the account of the rents and profits was taken by the registrar for a period of time that not only commenced thirteen days prior to the date of the fraudulent registration but extended beyond the date of the judgment. Not only this, but it would appear that in the action a receiver had been appointed by the court pendente lite and that the accounts for the period covered by the reference were divided into two groups, one relating to the period prior to and the other to the period subsequent to the appointment of the receiver. The balance of the moneys in the hands of the receiver, some $3,721.75, should be treated as moneys to which the respondents as successful plaintiffs in the action were entitled. But in any event the loss of the rents and profits did not arise \"in consequence of the fraudulent registration,\" to use the exact words of the statute, and stand in a totally different position to the registered mortgage. The rents and profits therefore cannot properly be taken into account in arriving at the damages sustained in consequence of the fraudulent registration. If we disregard then the rents and profits and consider only the mortgage the damages might be said to be $30,000, but the matter is not so simple as that. The property has been revested in the respondents subject to the mortgage and the contract of purchase and sale has been rescinded. Substantial cash payments, however, were found by the registrar to have been made by the purchaser on account of the purchase price, $2,000 on the 1st December, 1925, and $8,000 in June, 1926, to which amounts the registrar added interest calculated to the date of his certificate, in the aggregate sum of $5,320, making the total payments so found with interest $15,320. With the property revested in the respondents the total principal payments of $10,000 on the purchase money at least must be taken into account if the actual damages suffered by the respondents are to be arrived at. Moreover, very substantial improvements were made to the buildings upon the lands. The defendants in the action in giving particulars of their statement of defence stated that they had expended the sum of $11,525 between February, 1926, and January, 1927, for altering the front of the building and show windows, redecorating the interior, replacing radiator, rewiring basement, installing awning fixtures and for architect's fees in respect of alterations; and while the repairs and improvements are not specifically dealt with in the registrar's certificate, the total disbursements during the first period for maintenance of the premises are given at $5,043.23, and during the second period at $32,457.68; and it does not seem unfair, therefore, to infer that the item in the particulars of the statement of defence relating to alterations and improvements and amounting to $11,525 was correct. If the true amount of damages is to be ascertained, it may be necessary to take this amount into consideration. The utter confusion into which one falls in attempting to deal with the subject matter of the judgment as substantially one of damages, though in form something quite different, is best evidenced by extracting from the judgment certified by the Court to the Minister the following paragraphs from the findings of the registrar on the reference:\nAnd I do further certify that the moneys received for the period from the 12th day of April, 1927, to the 18th November, 1933, on account of rents and profits of the said lands and premises amount to $49,241.93; and that the total disbursements during the said period for maintenance of the said lands and premises amount to $32,457.68; and that after deducting the said total disbursements from the total receipts for the said period there remains a balance of $16,784.25, being the net rents and profits during the said period; and after deducting therefrom the sum of $3,721.75 now in the hands of the said receiver, J. C. Bridgman, there remains the sum of $13,062.50, being the moneys received by the defendants or any of them from the rents and profits of the said lands and premises during the said period.\nUpon that state of facts, the courts below directed the issue of the old peremptory writ of mandamus against the Minister to compel him to pay to the respondents out of the Assurance Fund the full amount of the judgment in the action, $34,730.95, in effect as damages. Obviously that sum is not the amount of the damages and it is elementary that before mandamus will lie there must be a strict legal right and a proper and sufficient demand.\nEven with the analysis of the case that I have sought to make, I cannot approximately arrive at the amount of damages sustained in consequence of the fraudulent registration. I cannot help thinking that it was precisely in order to avoid questions of fact such as have been raised in these proceedings that the statute expressly provides that the certificate of the Court shewing an award of damages, in an action between the lawful owner and the wrongdoer, is a necessary foundation to a proper claim against the Minister under s. 218. It seems to me that it is the duty of this Court to hold that there be such a certificate. The alternative is a very difficult alternative. It really amounts to this, that the Court should direct the Minister upon the question what is to be considered as damages and what is to be omitted. In other words that the Court should resettle for the Minister the statement of the damages, if any, sustained by the person wrongfully deprived of land in consequence of a fraudulent registration by another person. The words of the statute completely negative the right of any further tribunal to review the decision of the action. This is in substance the language of Lord Hewart, C.J., in considering the certificate of value by the district auditor in the recent case of Rex v. Ayton, Ex Parte Cardiff Corporation[6]. However widely we might be disposed to relax the rigour of the strict requirements governing the right to the issue of a peremptory writ of mandamus in order to effectuate the spirit and intention of the legislation for the payment of claims out of the Assurance Fund, we cannot go so far as to say upon the facts and circumstances of this case that the Minister was not entitled to refuse the demand and that a writ of mandamus should be peremptorily issued to compel him to pay to the respondents the sum demanded or in fact any other sum. We are conscious of the probability, if not the certainty, that the respondents suffered substantial damages in consequence of the fraudulent registration complained of, but we cannot give the relief sought in these proceedings upon that basis. We feel confident, however, that the responsible advisers of the Crown in the province of British Columbia will not fail to see that in some way the respondents are fully compensated out of the Assurance Fund to the extent of any just claim they may have. We would respectfully draw the attention of the Minister of Finance to s. 226 of the statute, to which we have referred earlier in this judgment, as affording ample authority for doing justice in the matter.\nThe appeal must be allowed and the judgments below set aside.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Eric Pepler.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Walsh, Bull, Housser, Tupper & Ray.\n[1] [1935] 1 W.W.R. 113.\n[2] [1935] 1 W.W.R. 113.\n[3] (1892) L.R. 7 Q.B. 387, at 394.\n[4] [1891] 2 Q.B. 326, at 338.\n[5] [1872] L.R. 7 Q.B. 387, at 389.\n[6] [1935] 1 K.B. 225, at 234.\n",

The appellant, an insurance and indemnity company, issued to the respondent, a gas company, a policy by which it agreed to indemnify the respondent \"for any and all sums which the assured (respondent) \"shall by law be liable to pay for (inter alia) damages to property \"* * * as a result of any one accident caused by or arising out \"of the operation of natural gas * * * by or for the assured\"; the policy further provided that it was \"understood and agreed that \"the policy (was) issued to indemnify the assured (respondent) as \"the result of accidents caused by, or arising out of, all the assured's \"operations in drilling, handling and distribution of natural gas.\" While the policy was in force, gas accidentally escaped through a break in the service pipe located under the premises of a customer and caused a conflagration which did extensive damage to the customer's premises, the break resulting from the negligent installation of the pipe by the respondent's servants some years before. For this damage the respondent was adjudged liable, and after satisfying the judgment brought an action against the appellant on the policy for indemnity. The service pipe belonged to the owner of the building, but, like all other such pipes in the city, was installed by the respondent for the owner, who paid for it. The respondent's action was maintained by the trial judge, which judgment was affirmed by the appellate court.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Appellate Division, ([1934] 3 W.W.R. 638), that the liability of the respondent for the damages so arising was one covered by the express terms of the policy.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], affirming the judgment of the trial judge,' Ewing J.[2], in favour of the respondent for $47,749.96 on a policy of indemnity or casualty insurance. The material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nThomas N. Phelan K.C. for the appellant.\nG. H. Steer K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nDYSART J. ad hoc\u2014This is an appeal from the dismissal by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta of an appeal from a judgment in favour of the respondent for $47,749.96 and costs under a policy of indemnity insurance.\nThe appellant and the respondent both carry on business in the city of Edmonton, Alberta\u2014the appellant as an insurance company, and the respondent as a gas company. On January 1, 1932, the appellant issued to the respondent a policy whereby it contracted to indemnify the respondent throughout the calendar year 1932 against any loss resulting from accidents caused by or arising out of the respondent's operations in drilling, handling and distributing natural gas. The relevant provisions of the policy read as follows:\nThe company hereby agrees to indemnify the assured for any and all sums which the assured shall by law be liable to pay and shall pay or by final judgment be adjudged liable to pay (subject to the limitations hereinafter mentioned) as damages for injuries to or death of any person or persons (other than employees of the insured while acting as such) and for damages to property (other than property owned, leased and\/or operated by the assured) as a result of any one accident caused by or arising out of the operation of natural gas and electric power plants by and\/or for the assured covered hereunder.\n* * *\nIt is hereby understood and agreed that the policy to which this endorsement is attached, is issued to indemnify the assured as the result of accidents caused by, or arising out of, all the assured's operations in drilling, handling and distribution of natural gas.\nOn February 14, 1932, while the policy was in force, gas accidentally escaped from the service pipe located on the premises of a customer and caused a conflagration which did extensive damage to the customer's premises. For this damage the respondent was adjudged liable, and after satisfying the judgment brought an action against the appel- lant on the policy for indemnity, and in its turn secured a judgment from which the present appeal is taken.\nThe gas plant referred to in the policy consists of gas wells located some distance from the city, large mains for bringing the gas to the city, apparatus for reducing the natural pressure of the gas, mains for distributing the gas throughout the city streets and lanes, and finally service pipes for conducting the gas from the street mains to the gas meters placed by the company upon the premises of customers. The \"operations\" of every part of this plant are covered by the policy. The ownership is in the respondent of every part of the gas plant except those portions of the service pipes which lie in and upon the premises of customers connecting the street portion of the service pipes with the gas meters. And even these portions have all been supplied and installed by the respondent. In every instance, including that of the customer on whose premises the disastrous fire occurred in this case, the respondent insisted on installing the service pipe for the reason, presumably, that safe and satisfactory installation was more likely to be had from the respondent's own skilled and experienced workmen. After the installation, in this case as in all others, the customer paid the respondent the cost of the installation and became the owner of the pipe. The customer was the owner of the pipe at the time of the \"accident.\" There is no suggestion of interference with the pipe by the customer or by the \"conscious act of any other volition.\"\nIn the action by the customer, the learned trial judge, Ewing, J.[3], found that the gas which exploded had escaped from the break in the service pipe, that the break was the result of the negligent manner in which the pipe had been installed in 1928 by the respondent; and that these two facts, conjoined with fire, had caused the explosion for which he found the respondent liable.\nIn the suit on the policy the defence is raised that the negligent installation of 1928 was an act of construction of plant and had nothing to do with the \"operation\" of the plant within the meaning of the policy; and further, on any view of it, the negligence long antedated the period of time covered by the policy. The negligence in connection with the installation lay in the method of installing the pipe. Instead of excavating a trench for the reception of the pipe, the respondent's workmen forced the pipe endwise through the ground in the desired direction by means of powerful jack screws. The method is known as \"jacking.\" If the pipe in question had followed a true course in its enforced progress through the ground all would have been well; but it followed a devious course and as a result became sharply bent in places, and was thereby put under severe strain from which it eventually broke in 1932. The bends were not discovered till the pipe was excavated after the accident.\nIn distributing gas to its customer, the respondent forced the gas under pressure through the whole of its distributing system of street pipes and service pipes, through the gas meters to the point of consumption. Until the gas passed through the meter it remained the property of the respondent unmeasured as to quantity, and therefore undelivered as an article of merchandise: Sale of Goods, R.S. Alta. 1922, c. 146, s. 20, rule III.\nGas is a substance which unless properly confined is liable to escape and which, if it does escape, is liable to do damage to person or property The respondent as distributor was therefore bound to take all reasonable precautions to guard against the escape of such gas. This was a duty imposed upon it in favour of its customers and the public generally. Dominion Natural Gas Company Ltd. v. Collins & Perkins[4].\nIn that case, which originated in Ontario, natural gas escaped from a safety valve which had been allowed to get out of efficient working condition and caused an explosion and damage. The plaintiff sued both the gas company which had supplied and installed the equipment, and the railway company on whose premises the gas exploded. The gas company in its defence raised the ground that some one must have intermeddled with the equipment and so relieved it from responsibility. At page 646 Lord Dunedin says:\nIt has, however, again and again been held that in the case of articles dangerous in themselves, such as loaded firearms, poisons, explosives, and other things ejusdem generis, there is a peculiar duty to take precaution imposed upon those who send forth or install such articles when it is necessarily the case that other parties will come within their proximity. The duty being to take precaution, it is no excuse to say that the accident would not have happened unless some other agency than that of the defendant had intermeddled with the matter. A loaded gun will not go off unless some one pulls the trigger, a poison is innocuous unless some one takes it, gas will not explode unles it is mixed with air and then a light is set to it. Yet the cases of Dixon v. Bell[5], Thomas v. Winchester[6], and Parry v. Smith[7] are all illustrations of liability enforced. On the other hand, if the proximate cause of the accident is not the negligence of the defendant, but the conscious act of another volition, then he will not be liable. For against such conscious act of volition no precaution can really avail.\nThe respondent, having been exclusively responsible for the installation, must be held to have had notice of the defective condition of the pipe. When, therefore, it forced its gas into this defective pipe on February 14, 1932, it committed an act which can be characterized as nothing less than negligence, and when that gas escaped through a rupture in the defective pipe and caused damage to the customer, the respondent company was properly held responsible for the damage that ensued. This negligent use of the defective pipe within the period of time covered by the policy is sufficient, when conjoined with the other assigned causes, to support the judgment rendered against the respondent. It becomes unnecessary, therefore, to invoke the negligence of 1928.\nEven disregarding the element of negligence, it would still appear that the conflagration on the customer's premises was\nthe result of accidents * * * arising out of * * * the assured's operations in * * * handling and distribution of natural gas,\nand was, therefore, covered by the express terms of the policy. The explosion was certainly an accident in the sense that it was unexpected and undesired. It arose out of the distributing of gas through the respondent's distributing system in the ordinary course of the \"operations\" of the gas plant. On this broad ground, it would seem that the respondent's liability for the explosion may also be clearly rested.\nIn view of the conclusion already reached, it will be unnecessary to consider the other grounds urged for or against this appeal. One of these grounds, however, must be briefly referred to. It is that by co-operating with the respondent in defending the original action brought by the respondent's customer, the appellant thereby estopped itself from later repudiating liability under the policy for the customer's loss. Without definitely expressing an opinion on this question of estoppel, we are inclined to think that inasmuch as the right to co-operate in the defence was a contractual one conferred on the appellant by the specific terms of the policy, the exercise of that right could hardly give rise to an estoppel.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] [1934] 3 W.W.R. 638.\n[2] [1934] 3 W.W.R. 507.\n[3] [1934] 3 W.W.R. 507.\n[4] [1909] A.C. 640.\n[5] (1816) 5 M. & S. 198.\n[6] (1852) 6 N.Y.R. 397.\n[7] (1879) 4 C.P.D. 325.\n",

Pour les fins de l\u2019inscription en droit, les faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s sont cens\u00e9s prouv\u00e9s et d\u00e9montreraient, d\u2019apr\u00e8s les appelants, que la demanderesse n\u2019a aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat au maintien de la pr\u00e9sente action, parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019a rien perdu; les valeurs qu\u2019elle aurait donn\u00e9es en gage aux d\u00e9fendeurs n\u2019ayant jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9, vu qu\u2019elle ne pouvait y acqu\u00e9rir titre sans le consentement de son mari, soit par emprunt, donation ou acquisition. Or, les all\u00e9gu\u00e9s attaqu\u00e9s nient qu\u2019elle f\u00fbt d\u00fbment autoris\u00e9e.\nSi les op\u00e9rations de bourse incrimin\u00e9es sont r\u00e9ellement nulles et de nul effet, les mises en gage des diff\u00e9rentes valeurs devront aussi \u00eatre annul\u00e9es et les parties remises, autant que possible, dans l\u2019\u00e9tat o\u00f9 elles \u00e9taient auparavant. Il s\u2019agit du nantissement d\u2019une chose mobili\u00e8re que l\u2019article 1966 du code civil d\u00e9finit:\nun contrat par lequel une chose est mise entre les mains du cr\u00e9ancier, ou, \u00e9tant d\u00e9j\u00e0 entre ses mains, est par lui retenue, du consentement du propri\u00e9taire, pour s\u00fbret\u00e9 de la dette.\nLa chose peut \u00eatre donn\u00e9e soit par le d\u00e9biteur ou par un tiers en sa faveur.\nCe gage, d\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019article 1969 du code civil, donne\nau cr\u00e9ancier le droit de se faire payer sur la chose qui en est l\u2019objet par privil\u00e8ge et pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux autres cr\u00e9anciers.\nMais il ne peut, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de paiement de la dette, disposer du gage. Il peut le faire saisir et vendre suivant le cours ordinaire de la loi, d\u2019apr\u00e8s les articles 1969 et 1971 du code civil. Enfin l\u2019article 1972 nous dit que\nLe d\u00e9biteur est propri\u00e9taire de la chose jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019elle soit vendue ou qu\u2019il en soit dispos\u00e9 autrement. Elle reste entre les mains du cr\u00e9ancier comme un d\u00e9p\u00f4t pour assurer sa cr\u00e9ance.\nNous r\u00e9f\u00e9rant au chapitre concernant le d\u00e9p\u00f4t, nous trouvons les articles suivants:\n1799. Le d\u00e9p\u00f4t volontaire est celui qui se fait du consentement r\u00e9ciproque de la personne qui le fait et de celle qui le re\u00e7oit.\n1800. Le d\u00e9p\u00f4t volontaire ne peut avoir lieu qu\u2019entre personnes capables de contracter.\nN\u00e9anmoins si une personne capable de contracter accepte le d\u00e9p\u00f4t fait par une personne incapable, elle est tenue de toutes les obligations d\u2019un d\u00e9positaire, et pour l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de ces obligations, elle peut \u00eatre poursuivie par le tuteur ou autre administrateur de la personne qui a fait le d\u00e9p\u00f4t.\n1808. Le d\u00e9positaire ne peut pas exiger de la personne qui a fait le d\u00e9p\u00f4t la preuve qu\u2019elle est propri\u00e9taire de la chose d\u00e9pos\u00e9e.\nL\u2019action et les paragraphes du plaidoyer attaqu\u00e9s en droit reposent sur la nullit\u00e9 radicale que l\u2019article 183 du code civil \u00e9nonce en ces termes:\n183. Le d\u00e9faut d\u2019autorisation du mari, dans le cas o\u00f9 elle est requise, comporte une nullit\u00e9 que rien ne peut couvrir et dont se peuvent pr\u00e9valoir tous ceux qui y ont un int\u00e9r\u00eat n\u00e9 et actuel.\nComme le fait remarquer Mignault (Droit civil canadien, 1er volume, p. 548), il n\u2019en est pas ainsi aujourd\u2019hui en France. L\u2019article 225 du code Napol\u00e9on dit que la nullit\u00e9 fond\u00e9e sur le d\u00e9faut d\u2019autorisation ne peut \u00eatre oppos\u00e9e que par la femme, par son mari ou par les h\u00e9ritiers. Vu cette diff\u00e9rence essentielle entre notre droit et le droit fran\u00e7ais, il est plus prudent de ne pas appliquer \u00e0 notre esp\u00e8ce les autorit\u00e9s qui ont comment\u00e9 le code Napol\u00e9on. En France, l\u2019acte est annulable, tandis qu\u2019en ce pays l\u2019acte fait par la femme sans autorisation est nul ab initio. En France, la nullit\u00e9 n\u2019est que relative, tandis que chez nous elle est absolue et peut \u00eatre oppos\u00e9e par tous ceux qui y ont un int\u00e9r\u00eat n\u00e9 et actuel.\nPeut-on dire que les d\u00e9fendeurs ont l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat n\u00e9 et actuel requis pour opposer \u00e0 l\u2019incapable la nullit\u00e9 de la mise en sa possession ou celle des acquisitions qu\u2019elle aurait faites des valeurs mises en gage?\nL\u2019article 77 du code de proc\u00e9dure civile nous dit que:\nPour former une demande en justice, il faut y avoir int\u00e9r\u00eat.\nCet int\u00e9r\u00eat, except\u00e9 dans les cas de dispositions contraires, peut n\u2019\u00eatre qu\u2019\u00e9ventuel.\nL\u2019exception, vu que les v\u00e9ritables propri\u00e9taires des titres ne sont pas en cause et n\u2019ont d\u2019aucune fa\u00e7on, d\u2019apr\u00e8s le dossier, demand\u00e9 aux d\u00e9fendeurs la restitution des valeurs mises en gage, est bas\u00e9e sur le danger \u00e9ventuel que les d\u00e9fendeurs pourraient courir si, apr\u00e8s avoir remis les valeurs ou leur \u00e9quivalent en argent \u00e0 la demanderesse, les v\u00e9ritables propri\u00e9taires les leur r\u00e9clamaient. Encore une fois, ils n\u2019en ont rien fait jusqu\u2019\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent.\nIl ne peut y avoir de doute que la femme assist\u00e9e de son mari a l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat requis pour demander la d\u00e9claration de nullit\u00e9 de toutes les transactions intervenues entre elle et les d\u00e9fendeurs comme courtiers.\nPeut-on invoquer cette m\u00eame nullit\u00e9 en recherchant de quelle fa\u00e7on et de quelle personne elle a acquis ou s\u2019est procur\u00e9 par emprunt ou quelque autre proc\u00e9d\u00e9 les valeurs mises en gage et accept\u00e9es par les d\u00e9fendeurs et vendues au profit de ces derniers.\nSi le contrat est nul, la demanderesse n\u2019a encouru aucune dette; s\u2019il n\u2019a jamais exist\u00e9 de dette, les mises en gage en garantie de cette dette sont \u00e9galement nulles et les parties doivent, autant que possible, \u00eatre mises dans la situation o\u00f9 elle \u00e9taient lors de la mise en gage.\nPeut-on remonter plus haut et discuter dans la pr\u00e9sente instance, avant la reddition de compte, le titre de la demanderesse \u00e0 ces valeurs? Les d\u00e9fendeurs ont-ils un int\u00e9r\u00eat n\u00e9 et actuel exig\u00e9 par l\u2019article 183 du code civil, dont les termes sont moins g\u00e9n\u00e9raux que ceux de l\u2019article 77 C.P.C. et qui semble \u00eatre une disposition contraire \u00e0 l\u2019assertion d\u2019un droit \u00e9ventuel?\nLe savant juge Andrews, dont l\u2019opinion doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme tr\u00e8s respectable, a d\u00e9cid\u00e9, dans la cause de L\u00e9tourneau v. Blouin[3], que l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat n\u00e9 et actuel de l\u2019article 183 C.C. est un int\u00e9r\u00eat p\u00e9cuniaire imm\u00e9diat; qu\u2019un int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e9ventuel, comme celui r\u00e9sultant du danger que la femme revienne plus tard r\u00e9clamer de lui une pension alimentaire, n\u2019est pas un int\u00e9r\u00eat suffisant pour le mari s\u00e9par\u00e9 de corps pour faire prononcer la nullit\u00e9 d\u2019une vente faite par sa femme sans son autorisation.\nMais, dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les d\u00e9fendeurs n\u2019ont pas m\u00eame un int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e9ventuel. Avec Langelier, 5e volume, p. 397, sous l\u2019article 1808 C.C., nous sommes dispos\u00e9s \u00e0 dire que si le v\u00e9ritable propri\u00e9taire veut emp\u00eacher la remise au d\u00e9posant par le d\u00e9positaire, il doit pratiquer une saisie-revendication de la chose entre les mains du d\u00e9positaire. Sans cette revendication, le d\u00e9positaire n\u2019a pas le droit de refuser de restituer la chose d\u00e9pos\u00e9e \u00e0 celui qui a fait le d\u00e9p\u00f4t, sous pr\u00e9texte qu\u2019elle ne lui appartient pas mais appartient \u00e0 un tiers, parce que ce serait exciper du droit de ce dernier.\nLe texte de l\u2019article 1808 du code civil,\nLe d\u00e9positaire ne peut pas exiger de la personne qui a fait le d\u00e9p\u00f4t la preuve qu\u2019elle est propri\u00e9taire de la chose d\u00e9pos\u00e9e,\nsemble justifier la conclusion de Mignault, dans son huiti\u00e8me volume (p. 156), que\nle d\u00e9positaire est valablement d\u00e9charg\u00e9 de toute responsabilit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du v\u00e9ritable propri\u00e9taire en remettant la chose \u00e0 celui qui la lui a d\u00e9pos\u00e9e.\nCela fait dispara\u00eetre l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e9ventuel que font valoir les d\u00e9fendeurs.\nD\u2019apr\u00e8s le code fran\u00e7ais, si le d\u00e9positaire d\u00e9couvre que la chose a \u00e9t\u00e9 vol\u00e9e et qui en est le v\u00e9ritable propri\u00e9taire, il doit lui d\u00e9noncer le d\u00e9p\u00f4t avec sommation de le r\u00e9clamer dans un d\u00e9lai d\u00e9termin\u00e9 et suffisant. Si le propri\u00e9taire n\u00e9glige de r\u00e9clamer la chose, lui, le d\u00e9positaire, est valablement d\u00e9charg\u00e9 par la tradition qu\u2019il en fait \u00e0 celui duquel il l\u2019a re\u00e7ue.\nNos codificateurs n\u2019ayant pas reproduit cette disposition, nous restons purement et simplement avec l\u2019obligation du d\u00e9positaire de remettre la chose d\u00e9pos\u00e9e \u00e0 la personne qui a fait le d\u00e9p\u00f4t, sans qu\u2019il puisse exiger d\u2019elle la preuve qu\u2019elle est propri\u00e9taire de la chose.\nLa Cour de Revision, \u00e0 Quebec, compos\u00e9e du juge-en-chef Meredith et des juges Stuart et Caron, dans la cause de Tourigny v. Bouchard[4], a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 express\u00e9ment:\nthat a bailee of moveables cannot question the title of the person who has placed such moveables in his care.\nMignault, en commentant l\u2019article 1975 du code civil, dans son huiti\u00e8me volume (p. 409), dit:\nIl para\u00eet \u00e0 peine n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019ajouter que lorsque le code parle de paiement comme mettant fin au droit de r\u00e9tention du cr\u00e9ancier, il faut \u00e9tendre sa disposition \u00e0 tout mode d\u2019extinction des obligations. Du moment que la dette est \u00e9teinte, le gage qui est un contrat accessoire, ne saurait subsister.\nSi, comme dans notre esp\u00e8ce, le contrat de gage est un contrat accessoire dont le sort doit suivre le sort du contrat principal qu\u2019il garantit, il faut rejeter tout moyen qui permettrait de maintenir les cons\u00e9quences du contrat accessoire alors que le contrat principal est reconnu nul et caduc. D\u00e8s lors que l\u2019emprunt est nul, le gage qui le garantit doit tomber: aucun moyen de droit ne doit \u00eatre mis au service du gagiste pour lui assurer la conservation des pr\u00e9rogatives attach\u00e9es \u00e0 une qualit\u00e9 et \u00e0 un titre qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas. La demanderesse n\u2019invoque pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment un droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, mais bien plut\u00f4t, et m\u00eame uniquement, une action personnelle qui n\u2019est autre que l\u2019action en nullit\u00e9 du contrat de gage. Le d\u00e9tenteur est donc tenu d\u2019une obligation personnelle de restitution. Voir D\u00e9rivaud & autres C. Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais & autres, Cassation, Gazette du Palais, 1922, volume 2, page 46.\nSi les d\u00e9clarations de nullit\u00e9 demand\u00e9es par l\u2019action doivent \u00eatre accord\u00e9es\u2014et pour la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019inscription en droit les parties ont admis la nullit\u00e9 des transactions\u2014le contrat de gage dispara\u00eet et nous restons avec un simple d\u00e9p\u00f4t entre les mains des d\u00e9fendeurs qui, aux termes de l\u2019article 1808, ne peuvent pas exiger de la personne qui a fait le d\u00e9p\u00f4t la preuve qu\u2019elle est propri\u00e9taire de la chose d\u00e9pos\u00e9e. Or, c\u2019est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment l\u00e0 le litige que les d\u00e9fendeurs ont cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 soulever par les quatre all\u00e9gu\u00e9s de leur plaidoyer, que les cours inf\u00e9rieures ont, \u00e0 bon droit, retranch\u00e9s du dossier comme \u00e9trangers \u00e0 la question soulev\u00e9e par l\u2019action de la demanderesse et partant inutiles \u00e0 la solution du litige.\nPour ces raisons, l\u2019appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nBarclay J. ad hoc\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Brown, Montgomery & McMichael.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Hackett, Mulvena, Foster, Hackett & Hannen.\n[1] (1934) Q.R. 56 K.B. 573.\n[2] (1934) Q.R. 56 K.B. 573.\n[3] (1892) Q.R. 2 S.C. 425.\n[4] (1878) 4 Q.L.R. 243.\n",

But, in order to avoid further litigation and costs, considering the elements contained in the record, the valuation placed on the flooded land by the judgment of the appellate court should be reduced by one-half.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, reversing the judgment of Stackhouse J., Circuit Court, which had held that certain flooded or submerged lands were not assessable for purposes of taxation as having no real value.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the judgments now reported.\nH. E. Walker K.C. for the appellant.\nAlphonse D\u00e9cary K.C. for the respondent. Duff C.J.\u2014I do not find it necessary to dissent from the judgment upon which my colleagues have agreed. The amount involved is insignificant and although, I humbly think, we should follow the logical course by referring back the question of value with instructions as to the principles upon which that value is to be ascertained in accordance with the views I am about to express, still, I think, it is really a case of de minimis and that, whatever the result of such a reference, the pecuniary advantage to the appellants would be merely negligible. I wish to make it very clear, however, that I disagree with the principles upon which the majority of the court proceeds. We have to apply a statute of the legislature of Quebec. That statute lays upon the assessor a duty which is defined in sections 485 and 488 of The Cities and Towns Act. Those sections are in these words:\n485. The assessors shall each year, at the time and in the manner ordered by the council, assess the taxable property of the municipality, according to its real value.\n488. The actual value of the real estate in the municipality assessable for purposes of taxation shall comprise lands and buildings, workshops and machinery and their accessories thereon erected, and all the improvements made thereto.\nObviously, \u201creal value\u201d and \u201cactual value\u201d are regarded by the legislature as convertible expressions. The construction of these phrases does not, I think, present any difficulty. The meaning of \u201cactual value,\u201d when used in a legal instrument, subject, of course, to any controlling context, is indicated by the following passage from the judgment of Lord MacLaren in Lord Advocate v. Earl of Home[1]:\nNow, the word \u201cvalue\u201d may have different meanings, like many other words in common use, according as it is used in pure literature, or in a business communication or in conversation. But I think that \u201cvalue\u201d when it occurs in a contract has a perfectly definite and known meaning unless there be something in the contract itself to suggest a meaning different from the ordinary meaning. It means exchangeable value\u2014the price which the subject will bring when exposed to the test of competition.\nWhen used for the purpose of defining the valuation of property for taxation purposes, the courts have, in this country, and, generally speaking, on this continent, accepted this view of the term \u201cvalue.\u201d In Grierson v. Edmonton[2], Sir Charles Fitzpatrick, with, I think, the concurrence of all the members of the Court, used these words:\nSpeaking generally the intrinsic value of a piece of property must necessarily be the price which it will command in the open market and the local Judge sitting in appeal with his knowledge and experience in ascertaining the price of real estate within his jurisdiction would, under normal conditions, be in a better position to judge of the value of such property than I can assume to be.\nIn Cummings v. Merchants\u2019 National Bank of Toledo[3], Mr. Justice Miller, speaking for the majority of the Supreme Court of the United States, said:\nIt is proper to say, in extenuation of the rule of primary valuation of different species of property developed in this record, that it is not limited to the State of Ohio, or to part of it. The constitutions and the statutes of nearly all the States have enactments designed to compel uniformity of taxation and assessments at the actual value of all property liable to be taxed. The phrases \u201csalable value,\u201d \u201cactual value,\u201d \u201ccash value,\u201d and others used in the directions to assessing officers, all mean the same thing, and are designed to effect the same purpose. Burr. Tax., p. 227, sec. 99. But it is a matter of common observation that in the valuation of real estate this rule is habitually disregarded.\nThe court in that case virtually adopted a passage in Burroughs on Taxation at page 227. The writer of that well known textbook treated the rule as settled in the United States, and the Supreme Court of the United States adopted his view.\nI mention also the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Ireland in Curneen and Tottenham[4], (Lord Ashbourne, Chancellor, FitzGibbon, Barry and Walker L.JJ.) and particularly the judgment of FitzGibbon L.J. at p. 362-3).\nOf course, it may be that there is no competitive market at the date as of which the value is to be ascertained. In such circumstances, other indicia may be resorted to. There may be reasonable prospects of the return of a market, in which case it might not be unreasonable for the assessor to evaluate the present worth of such prospects and the probability of an investor being found who would invest his money on the strength of such prospects; and there may be other relevant circumstances which it might be proper to take into account as evidence of its actual capital value. Considerations of this character, as we will see, do not come into play on this appeal. I think it important to say that, in my view, the standard of assessment laid down by the Legislature of the province of Quebec is not a standard which, for the purpose of assessing property for taxation purposes under these sections (485 and 488), admits of the application of the principle by which compensation to the owner of land is determined when it is compulsorily taken from him under the authority of an expropriation act. In the case of expropriation, the rule is undisputed. The person whose property is taken is entitled to be compensated for the loss he has suffered by being deprived of his land compulsorily; the value of the land, for the purpose of ascertaining such compensation, is the value of the land to him. Cases often arise in which the land taken has no market value for various reasons, and no value which could be ascertained by a reference to any of the considerations just mentioned. Nevertheless, compensation must be paid; and one method of ascertaining that compensation has been applied in, for example, cases where a recreation park, that the owners are prohibited from alienating, or a part of a golf course, which the owners would not alienate, and in respect of which there would be no purchaser, except, possibly, for a price measured by the agricultural value of the land, and that method is described in the formula enunciated by Lord Moulton in Pastoral Finance Assn, Ltd. v. The Minister[5]: the owner is entitled to that which a prudent man in his position would have been willing to give for the land sooner than fail to obtain it.\nThere is no room for the application of any such formula in the administration of an assessment act, because the amount ascertained under the formula depends upon the special position of the owner with regard to the land. If the owner were a golf club, it would be influenced in determining the amount it would be willing to pay by reference to the convenience of having the particular piece of land in view of its situation and adaptability as a part of the particular golf course. That is not a principle of valuation contemplated, in my opinion, by the assessment provisions of The Cities and Towns Act. These assessments provisions, like other assessment provisions, contemplate an objective standard which can be applied with fairly reasonable uniformity to all classes of owners alike.\nIt seems to me clear that the assessors in this case proceeded upon some rule of thumb and they did not really attempt to ascertain the actual or real value of the particular lands they were assessing.\nMoreover, it is very important to insist on two things: first, there is not a scrap of evidence before this Court by reference to which we can determine the value of this property to the appellant; its value, let us say, as part of the appellant\u2019s undertaking considered as an integer. We do not know that the undertaking as a whole, or this particular part of it, has any value whatever to the appellants. For all we know it may be damnosa haereditas. On that basis, we cannot judicially find that it has any value and any figure assumed to be the result of such a process could be nothing but a guess. Second, there is no evidence before us that there is not any market for this property, nor do we know that there may not be some method according to which, by reference to other circumstances, some actual value might not be arrived at.\nI am disposed to think that market value, present or prospective, is really the only practical basis of the assessment of this property under the enactments by which we are governed; but, if some other method were admissible, we have been left entirely without information as to the necessary facts to enable us to apply it.\nI have no doubt, I should add, that the assessors did not perform the act of valuation in respect of the submerged lands as required by the statute as essential to a valid assessment, and, consequently, that there was no valid assessment in point of law; nor do I doubt that this Court has no materials before it by which it can perform the act of assessment itself.\nThe judgment of Rinfret, Cannon, Crocket and Hughes JJ. was delivered by\nCannon J.\u2014The appellant brought before the Circuit Court for the district of Montreal, under the provisions of s. 504 of the Cities and Towns Act (R.S.Q. 1925, c. 102) an appeal against the homologation by the municipality of the valuation roll for 1932 to the end that the valuation roll may be amended and the values placed on the property of the company fixed at their true value and comparatively equal to the values placed on other properties in the said municipality.\nThis seemed to limit the conflict to an alleged discrimination against the company. In its conclusions, however, the appellant demanded that the Circuit Court fix the valuation as indicated in a certain statement annexed to their notice of appeal. This statement showed the 1931 assessed value per square foot of each lot belonging to the appellant in Laval des Rapides and also the valuation complained of with the company\u2019s valuation. Opposite each of the flooded areas in that statement, the company\u2019s valuation appears to be: Nil.\nThe learned trial judge, Stackhouse, C.C.J., considered that in assessing appellant\u2019s flooded lands as being industrial lands at the same valuation as those lands which are not flooded, the respondent adopted a wrong principle of law; that these flooded or submerged lands have no real value and, therefore, their assessment for taxable purposes is illegal, null and should be set aside.\nThe town brought the matter before the Court of King\u2019s Bench and was successful on this issue, the formal judgment fixing at ten cents per foot the real value of the submerged land, the same as that of the adjoining riparian lots. Bernier and Hall, J.J., dissented and gave elaborate reasons accepting the finding of the trial judge.\nThe company brought the matter before us for the sole purpose, according to its factum, of determining\n(1) Has the municipality the right to tax the land which has been flooded?\n(2) If this land can be taxed, is it fair to tax it at the same value per foot as the adjacent unflooded land?\nAnd it contends: First, that the flooded areas on the Boulevard des Prairies at 10 cents a foot: $51,788.90, and the flooded areas in the Marigo (which was periodically flooded before the establishment of the company\u2019s dam) at varied valuations per arpent and per foot: $12,509.65, total: $64,298.55, should be entirely struck from the valuation roll; second, that in any case, if these flooded areas are to be valued at all, they should not be valued at the same per foot valuation as is placed on their marketable dry land. Section 485 of the Cities and Towns Act, R.S.Q. 1925, c. 102, provides that\nThe assessors shall each year, at the time and in the manner ordered by the council, assess the taxable property of the municipality, according to its real value.\nSection 488, under the caption \u201cWhat real estate taxable?\u201d says:\nThe actual valuation of the real estate in the municipality assessable for the purposes of taxation shall comprise lands and buildings, work-shops and machinery and their accessories thereon erected, and all the improvements made thereto.\nSection 500 enables the council, after the homologation of the roll, to cause the valuation of such property to be reduced to its real value if it is considerably diminished in value either by fire, the pulling down of buildings or any other cause.\nThe powers of the Circuit Court on the appeal are\n(a) to confirm the decision appealed from, amend or annul the same;\n(b) or render such decision as the council ought to have rendered;\n(c) order it to exercise the functions respecting which recourse is had (sec. 510).\nSection 511 enacts that the decisions of the council may be set aside only when a substantial injustice has been committed and never by reason of any trifling variance or informality.\nIt should be noted immediately that the company never asked for the annulment of the roll, but only for its amendment, so that, on the face of the record, it must be found that these flooded areas, not forming part of the natural bed of the Rivi\u00e8re des Prairies, are not public property. They are still owned by the appellant, so that there only remains the second question: Had this flooded land in 1932 any real or actual value?\nIn the year 1928, the appellant, having obtained a lease of the bed of the Rivi\u00e8re des Prairies from the province of Quebec for the purpose of establishing a power house at St. Vincent-de-Paul village, which is situate a few miles below Laval des Rapides, also obtained authority under the provisions of the Watercourses Act, 1925, R.S.Q., c. 46, to submerge all lands necessary to raise the level of the river to a certain elevation. After a long drawn period of discussions, the legislature of the province of Quebec, on the 7th of May, 1909, passed 9 Ed. VII, c. 68, with this preamble:\nWhereas the development and utilization of the falls and water-powers of the province is a matter of pub he utility as they tend to the advancement of industries established and the creation of new ones by allowing of the utilization of their motive power;\nWhereas certain conditions hinder the development and utilization of such falls and powers and it is important to cause the same to disappear, while at the same time safeguarding the private interests affected;\nenacting as follows:\n1. Every water-power formed by a lake, pond, water-course or river whether floatable or not, belonging to any person, is declared to be a matter of public interest, and the proprietor thereof may proceed to expropriate the adjacent lands so as to allow him to utilize such water-powers in the manner and subject to the conditions mentioned in this Act.\n2. The following alone shall be subject to expropriation under this Act:\n1. Immoveable property or any part thereof and riparian rights, necessary for the establishment of factories, manufactories and their dependencies and for the construction and maintenance of drains, canals, sluices, pipes and flumes.\n2. Immoveable property or any part thereof, necessary for roads communicating with the most convenient highway as well as for the posts, wires, conduits and apparatus used for the transmission of power, light or heat, subject to the approval of the municipal council of the locality when such posts, wires, conduits and apparatus are placed on a highway.\n3. Such expropriation under this Act shall not take place except for the benefit of a water-power of an average natural force of at least two hundred horse power, and large enough for industrial purposes, and shall in no case prejudice an industry already established or waterworks supplying a municipality wholly or in part.\nThese sections are now sections 16, 17 and 18 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec (1925), c. 46.\nThis legislation completed the existing right embodied in article 503 of the Civil Code.\nAre also relevant the following sections of the same Watercourses Act:\n4. Every owner of land may improve any watercourse bordering upon, running along or passing across his property, and may turn the same to account by the construction of mills, manufactories, works and machinery of all kinds, and for such purpose may erect and construct in and about such water-course, all the works necessary for its efficient working, such as flood-gates, flumes, embankments, dams, dykes and the like.\n5. 1. No flood-gate, flume, embankment, dam, dyke or other similar work, the construction or maintenance of which will cause public property or the property of third persons or public or private rights to be affected, either by the backing up of the waters or otherwise, shall be constructed or maintained in any of the water-courses referred to in section 4, unless the site on which it is to be constructed has been approved by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, nor unless it is constructed and maintained in accordance with plans and specifications likewise approved by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council. 2. If any such work be constructed without such approval, or if, after having been constructed, it be not kept up in accordance with the plans and specifications which have been so approved, the demolition of such work and the restoration of such public or private land to its original condition as nearly as possible approaching thereto, may be ordered by any court of competent jurisdiction, upon an ordinary action instituted by the Crown or by any interested party, according as the land taken, occupied or affected is public or private property, without prejudice to any other recourse at law.\n22. No expropriation proceedings may be had unless the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, upon application of one of the parties, notice whereof must be given to the other, has first approved of the area to be expropriated.\nThe application for approval must be made by petition to the Minister of Lands and Forests, accompanied by plans of the land to be expropriated and by reasons in support of the application.\nActing under these provisions, the company either expropriated or purchased the lands in question in lieu of paying the damages anticipated from the necessary floodings which would practically have destroyed their whole value for their then owners. It would appear that the total price paid was $709,397.79.\nIt is also in evidence that the company, before submerging these lands, laid on same rubble stone masonry to prevent erosion by water.\nThe assessors, considering that these lands were used for industrial purposes, fixed a higher value on them than that on neighbouring lands which were mostly used for residential purposes.\nThe Court of King\u2019s Bench said that, under the circumstances and in view of the fact that these lands were only an adjunct of the water-power of the appellant which is situate in the neighbouring municipality, the land owned by the company and used for the purpose of raising the water level of the river should be treated as equal in value to its dry land adjacent.\nIt seems to me that when attempting to increase the real or actual value of these flooded lands for the reason that they had become industrialized as part of the water-power development of the appellant, the assessors and the municipality lost sight of the important fact that the water-power site and generating plant, the industry is situate miles below, outside the limits of Laval des Rapides. The power site which has been developed by the company, the source of electrical energy, which would be called in French \u201cla houille blanche\u201d does not exist in Laval des Rapides and, therefore, is clearly not assessable by the respondent. The lands are needed in Laval des Rapides, not to generate power, but to avoid paying damages to the riparian owners whose properties were affected by the building of the dam.\nIn 1918, in France, they passed legislation similar to the one adopted by the Quebec legislature in 1909 and for the same purposes. In order to facilitate the exploitation of water-powers, the state intervened and gave or exercised expropriation powers to abate the nuisance of the \u201cbarreurs de chutes,\u201d the owners whose excessive demands often proved a complete barrier to the creation and exploitation of hydraulic forces. Messrs. Planiol & Ripert, Droit Civil, vol. 3, p. 488, say:\nUn bien nouveau a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9 par la loi: l\u2019\u00e9nergie hydraulique. Non pas que celle-ci n\u2019exist\u00e2t auparavant, mais elle \u00e9tait confondue avec l\u2019eau qui lui sert de v\u00e9hicule; elle n\u2019\u00e9tait que l\u2019une des formes d\u2019utilisation de l\u2019eau. Elle acquiert d\u00e9sormais une individualit\u00e9 juridique; elle se s\u00e9pare de J\u2019eau de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re que, dans la l\u00e9gislation mini\u00e8re, la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du tr\u00e9fonds est s\u00e9par\u00e9e de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la surface. Et ce bien nouveau va ob\u00e9ir \u00e0 des r\u00e8gles propres, d\u00e9termin\u00e9es eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 sa nature et \u00e0 son r\u00f4le \u00e9conomique.\nWhether this new species of property, the hydraulic power, is to be considered as moveable or immoveable, is not a question which we have to decide in the present case. Even if it be an immoveable, it would not exist, as stated above, within the limits of the respondent municipality.\nBut nowhere have I been able to find in the Cities and Towns Act power to value and assess hydraulic powers such as the one developed and owned by the appellant on Rivi\u00e8re des Prairies. Whether or not these flooded lands which we are now considering form part of the bottom or the sides of the reservoir authorized by the province under certain conditions, I do not think that they had, as such, in 1932, a real market value; even if the company had wished to dispose of them, nobody would have been willing to purchase them separately in their present state. But the company goes too far when it claims that these lands holding the water of the Rivi\u00e8re des Prairies are of no real or actual value to it.\nOn the other hand, I am not ready to say with the Court of King\u2019s Bench that the value of this submerged property is the same as that of the dry land belonging to the company adjacent thereto. Value of property in the neighbourhood is an element to be considered; but in order to adopt the same value for two neighbouring properties they must be similar. No one can contend that, during the year 1932, similar conditions were found in the flooded portions and the dry land. Some of the latter at least could have been offered for sale for building purposes by the company with the advantage of being on the new artificial shore of the river. But none of the flooded land could be used for any purpose, except perhaps to add to the enjoyment of the riparian owners by the acquisition from the company of a water lot opposite the shore. The water, either impounded or not, is not the property of the company. It is one of the things which, under art. 585 of the Civil Code have no owner and the use of which is common to all. The enjoyment of it is regulated by laws of public policy; and, in the province of Quebec, by the above quoted sections of the revised statutes supplementing art. 503 of the code, which reads as follows:\n503. He whose land borders on a running stream, not forming part of the public domain, may make use of it as it passes, for the utility of his land, but in such manner as not to prevent the exercise of the-same right by those to whom it belongs; saving the provisions contained in chapter 51 of the Consolidated Statutes for Lower Canada, or other special enactments.\nHe whose land is crossed by such stream may use it within the whole space of its course through the property, but subject to the obligation of allowing it to take its usual course when it leaves his land.\nPlaniol & Ripert, in the same volume, define exactly what I have in mind as follows:\n492. Condition juridique des eaux courantes. A la diff\u00e9rence du lit sur lequel elles coulent, les eaux courantes font partie des choses communes qui n\u2019appartiennent \u00e0 personne, mais qui diff\u00e8rent des choses sans ma\u00eetre, en ce que nul n\u2019en peut devenir propri\u00e9taire exclusif, parce que leur usage est commun \u00e0 tous. Il r\u00e9sulte de l\u00e0 que les eaux courantes sont, en principe, \u00e0 la disposition du public. Mais la loi a reconnu au profit des seuls riverains certains droits d\u2019usage particuliers, appel\u00e9s droits de riverainet\u00e9.\n493. Droits de la collectivit\u00e9 sur les eaux courantes. Les eaux courantes \u00e9tant des res communes, le public poss\u00e8de sur ces eaux un droit d\u2019usage g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Il faut en d\u00e9duire que chacun peut s\u2019en servir en vue des usages domestiques, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire puiser de l\u2019eau, se baigner, laver du linge, faire abreuver les animaux domestiques et aussi circuler en bateau, puisque cet usage n\u2019est prohib\u00e9 par aucun texte particulier.\nMais ce droit d\u2019usage g\u00e9n\u00e9ral rencontre dans son exercice une triple limitation. Tout d\u2019abord, il ne peut \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 que si l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la rivi\u00e8re est possible. Or, s\u2019analysant juridiquement en une simple facult\u00e9 l\u00e9gale, il ne donne pas \u00e0 son titulaire le pouvoir de contraindre les riverains \u00e0 lui livrer passage. Il n\u2019est donc pratiquement r\u00e9alisable que sur les points o\u00f9 le cours d\u2019eau est contigu \u00e0 un terrain laiss\u00e9 \u00e0 la disposition du public. Ensuite, il ne doit pas porter atteinte aux droits reconnus par la loi au profit des riverains, car, s\u2019il peut y avoir conflit d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats entre le public et ces derniers, il ne peut y avoir entre eux conflit de droits, puisque le public ne jouit que d\u2019une simple facult\u00e9. Enfin, il est soumis aux r\u00e8glements de police qui peuvent en r\u00e9gler l\u2019exercice.\nThe fact that water is within reach and easy of access of the dry lands owned by the company might add to the value of this part of its property but does not add to the market or actual value of the land supporting the increased volume of water resulting from the erection of the company\u2019s dam a few miles below. It appears by the document annexed to the complaint that these flooded lots were assessed in 1931 at prices ranging from 00\u2153 of a cent per square foot to, in a few instances, 12\u00bc and 17\u00bd. Despite the fact that that company did not in 1931 protest the valuation cannot bind them as to the real or actual value of this property in 1932, may it not be said with fairness that at least they did not feel that they were suffering the substantial injustice that would, according to sec. 511 of the Cities and Towns Act, have authorized the court to amend the valuation? Therefore, I do not agree with the motive given by the Court of King\u2019s Bench to assimilate and treat as being of equal value the flooded and the non-flooded property.\nOn the other hand, this flooded land owned by the appellant within Laval des Rapides is assessable and must be given some actual or real value. The appellant says in its memorandum that the case was conducted before the Circuit Court on the assumption that if the flooded area could not be taxed on the basis of the use the company was making of it, it would have no market value.\nLeach states, confirming the document filed with the notice of appeal, that the company\u2019s valuation on the flooded area in each case is: Nil; and that he considers it to have no value.\nFillion, one of the town\u2019s witnesses, testifies as follows:\nD. Pensez-vous, prenons quelques-unes des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s de la Montreal Island Power Company par exemple la subdivision de lot cadastral 296, pensez-vous qu\u2019on puisse emprunter de l\u2019argent sur cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9-l\u00e0? * * * Sur le terrain priv\u00e9, l\u00e0? * * * L\u2019un ou l\u2019autre. R. Bien s\u00fbr qu\u2019on peut emprunter de l\u2019argent mais beaucoup moins.\nD. Mais personne ne les ach\u00e8te? R. Je crois bien, vous les avez inond\u00e9es presque toutes. D. Si on veut vendre ces propri\u00e9t\u00e9s-l\u00e0 est-ce qu\u2019elles n\u2019ont pas de valeur du tout? R. Non, je comprends les terrains qui ne sont pas b\u00e2tissables * * *\nD. Maintenant, ils n\u2019ont pas de valeur du tout? R. Je comprends que vous les avez noy\u00e9es d\u2019un bout \u00e0 l\u2019autre.\nAnd Trottier, the chief assessor of the town, says:\nD. En mettant une \u00e9valuation sur une terre, ordinairement il y a des bases sur lesquelles vous pouvez fixer la valeur, par exemple, il y a des ventes et il y a l\u2019utilit\u00e9 de ces terrains; mais si vous voulez \u00e9valuer un bord de l\u2019eau situ\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs milles au-dessus d\u2019un d\u00e9veloppement, hydraulique, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 un peu inond\u00e9 par ce d\u00e9veloppement qu\u2019est-ce qu\u2019il y a pour indiquer une valeur, comment pouvez-vous fixer un prix de vingt cents (0.20), c\u2019est ce que je voudrais savoir? R. Le prix de vingt cents (0.20) c\u2019est la mani\u00e8re de l\u2019employer, ce terrain-l\u00e0. Le propri\u00e9taire le veut pour manufacturer de l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9, il passe de l\u2019eau pour manufacturer de l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9, il fait un pouvoir, il couvre des terrains d\u2019eau qui n\u2019auront aucune valeur \u00e0 Vavenir, qui sont finis pour toujours. Tout cela, c\u2019est pour des fins industrielles, c\u2019est du commerce, c\u2019est de la manufacture, c\u2019est pour faire de l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 pour envoyer en dehors, ici et l\u00e0. Ce n\u2019est pas du commerce comme un autre. C\u2019est la raison pour laquelle nous avons mis cela \u00e0 vingt cents (0.20). Nous consid\u00e9rons que c\u2019est une industrie. Que ce soit la Montreal Island Power ou une autre, il n\u2019y a pas de diff\u00e9rence, il n\u2019y a pas de parti pris.\nThis epitomizes the basic principle adopted by the assessors, which goes too far, in my opinion. They considered as assessable the electrical power, the product of the harnessing of the river. Hawley, one of the appellant\u2019s witnesses, stated that it would be disposed to allow any purchaser of one of its riparian lots, if he wished it,\nto fill in to the original property line, that is the amount of property the company had under water.\nTreating, therefore, this property separate and apart from the water which flows over it, just as a bottle containing wine may be considered as distinct from its content, we cannot ignore that the appellant used the submerged land to impound water to turn the wheels of its generating units. The simplest and most convenient method would be to value the whole development as an entire thing; but this cannot be done as only a part of the property is situate in the respondent\u2019s territory. We are, therefore, compelled to separate the whole into its component parts and to value such parts separately. While that method is more difficult, it involves no injustice or unfairness to the taxpayer, because, after all, the value of the whole would be the sum of the values of its component parts considered as parts of the whole. The appellant, as far as I understand the case, does not object to the valuation of its submerged lands as separate items, but contends their valuation is excessive and includes elements which were not incidental or a part of the land as land. In 1932, these submerged lots had no intrinsic value as land in the ordinary acceptation of the word, if considered as separate and independent parcels. They were not adapted or adaptable to many of the uses to which land is ordinarily put. They could not be utilized or grazed, nor could they be used for residential or any other industrial purposes; they could, as above mentioned, be utilized for the service and enjoyment of the owner of adjoining riparian lots when these were of sufficient depth to foe sold for residential purposes. But when all these parcels were consolidated by the company into a single unit which could be utilized as an aid in the profitable production of power, they each acquired in the hands of the appellants a definite actual value by reason of that relationship as part of that unit. \u201cThe company had made the realization of a potentiality a certainty for itself.\u201d Anglin J. Irwin v. Campbell[6].\nI therefore say that the assessors would have ignored the actual tangible fact if they had considered that each piece of property had no value, except from its quality as land. The power producing unit including these lots might unquestionably foe sold as a whole and the real value of these lands lies in the fact that they are part of a natural basin through which the river flows and within a few miles falls, and that, by the erection of a dam across the only outlet from that basin, the waters of that river may be and have been impounded so as to generate power. I cannot say that its realized utility for that purpose gives no additional value to the land. As stated by the Court of Appeal of Maryland in the case of Susquehanna Power Company v. State Tax Commission[7], affirmed by the Supreme Court of the United States[8]:\nNo one of the parcels into which the lands were formerly divided had any such utility considered apart from the other parcels which together form the value, for unless all were used none could be used. But when they were all gathered into a single unit and the potential utility latent in them became available and apparent and for that reason when so held the entire tract of land was properly assessed as a unit. But the record shews that the respondent municipality and the appellant, as well as the courts below, have undertaken to value each parcel of land separately; they could not do otherwise, the real water power having been developed elsewhere. In considering the value of each parcel, can we ignore the fact that the company owns not only the parcel in question but all the other lots in the respondent municipality which were especially adaptable to contribute to the attainment of the object of its incorporation and the exercise of the licence from the provincial government to create new wealth in the national interest under the form of electrical power? I believe that in order to reach the real actual value, some consideration must be given to that special adaptability which has been utilized by the appellant.\nOn the other hand, the acquisition price paid once for all to avoid the payment of damages to the riparian owners is not the actual value to the company after the property has been flooded. It represents the value to the vendor plus the value of the special adaptability and immediate prospects and, besides, the damages resulting from the expropriation.\nWhat should be done under such circumstances?\nI think that we have the power to refer the case back to the judge who heard the appeal from the assessors, in order that he might, if necessary, hear fresh evidence, to value, on what we believe proper principles, the flooded lands. But, in order to avoid further litigation and costs with the elements in hand, including the 1931 valuation, the valuation now accepted by both parties for 1932 of the lots not covered by water owned by the company immediately adjoining the flooded lots, and for the motives hereinabove exposed, I would rather settle the matter and reduce the valuation placed on these lots by the Court of King\u2019s Bench by one half, that is to say, I would substitute 5 cents to 10 cents a foot for the flooded lots along the Rivi\u00e8re des Prairies enumerated in the judgment a quo.\nIn his factum, the appellant\u2019s counsel said:\nIn the Marigo, we have accepted the town\u2019s valuation except that we put no value on what is under the water.\nThese Marigo lots consisted of a swamp before the water was raised. It had its mouth opening into the river a mile or two below Laval des Rapides. This swamp extended from its mouth back into the country, partly parallel but diverging from the river. The top of the Marigo extends into the territory of the respondent. When the river was raised, the Marigo was filled and, in anticipation, the company had purchased land both on the river frontage and on the Marigo. The unflooded land in the latter area was placed at a lower valuation and the flooded land valued at the same figure. Before us the appellant complained especially of the valuation of the water lots bordering the river. It does not seem to have stressed the same objection to the valuation placed by the municipality on the Marigo lots found in the judgment appealed from, and did not demur when M. D\u00e9cary stated that there was no appeal as far as this inlet is concerned or he said that the amount involved is insignificant. Therefore we should not interfere with the valuation of these Marigo lots and the appeal should be allowed in part and the valuation reduced to 5 cents for the water lots on the Rivi\u00e8re des Prairies. As both parties before this Court were partly successful, there will be no costs on this appeal.\nJudgment varied, no costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Chauvin, Walker, Stewart & Martineau.\nSolicitors for the respondent: D\u00e9cary & D\u00e9cary.\n[1] (1891) 28 Sc.

The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council held ([1933] A.C. 533) that there had been a valid contract binding upon the Crown, and that the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada ([1933] Ex.C.R. 164), holding that the claimants were entitled to recover from the Crown damages for breach of contract (reversed by the Supreme Court of Canada, [1932] S.C.R. 511), should be restored. By subsequent judgment in the Exchequer Court the claimants' damages were fixed at $400,000. The Crown appealed.\nHeld: Having regard to the terms of the claim as made and the form of the reference thereof to the Exchequer Court, and to the evidence, insufficient weight had been given, in fixing the damages, to certain factors (including the absence of a lease to a certain Government department, on which proposed lease, as well as on the lease first above mentioned, the claimants had depended, as indicated in their claim) tending to affect adversely the claimants' successful financing of the project. In fixing damages, the claimants were entitled to a valuation of possibilities or probabilities which, if becoming actualities, might have led to success of their project. On its above views, this Court fixed the damages at $75,000\nAPPEAL by the Crown from the judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada, holding that the claimants (the present respondents) were entitled to recover from the Crown $400,000 damages for breach of contract.\nThe contract in question was for the purchase by the claimant Forgie from the Crown of a certain property in the city of Toronto, on which property, combined with certain adjoining property, Forgie was to erect a twenty-six storey office building, certain floors of which were to be leased to the Crown. Forgie assigned all his right, title and interest in the contract to the claimant Dominion Building Corporation Limited. The latter claimed from the Crown damages for the Crown's refusal to carry out the alleged contract, which claim was referred by the Acting Minister of Railways and Canals (reserving the right to plead and maintain that the claimant was not entitled to any compensation) to the Exchequer Court of Canada. Forgie was subsequently added as a party claimant by an order in the Exchequer Court of Canada.\nThe action was tried by Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada, who held[1] (1) that the claimants were entiled to recover from the Crown damages for breach of contract, reserving in the meantime the ascertainment of the amount of such damages. On appeal by the Crown to the Supreme Court of Canada, this judgment was reversed and the action dismissed[2] . An appeal by the claimants to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council was allowed and the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada was restored[3]. The assessment of damages then came before Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada, who delivered judgment fixing the damages at $400,000. The present appeal was from the last mentioned judgment.\nThe material facts and circumstances of the case are sufficiently set out in the said reported judgments and in the judgments (particularly the judgment of Hughes J.) now reported. By the judgment of this Court, now reported, the judgment of the Exchequer Court was varied, by reducing the damages to $75,000.\nW. N. Tilley K.C. and C. F. H. Carson for the appellant.\nI. F. Hellmuth K.C., R. S. Robertson K.C., and W. R. Wadsworth K.C. for the respondents.\nDUFF C.J.\u2014I have come to the conclusion that the learned trial judge has not given sufficient weight to certain material circumstances, to some of which I shall call particular attention; and that it is necessary to examine the evidence as on a re-hearing to ascertain what damages the respondents are entitled to.\nI am unable to treat the claim advanced by the respondents, and the form of the reference to the Exchequer Court, as of inconsiderable importance. The reference is in these terms:\nIn the matter of Dominion Building Corporation, Limited, Claimants, and His Majesty the King, Respondent.\nReserving the right to plead and maintain that the said Dominion Building Corporation, Limited, is not entitled to any compensation, I hereby refer to the Exchequer Court of Canada the annexed claim of the said Dominion Building Corporation, Limited, for compensation alleged to be due by reason of the allegations therein set forth.\nDated at Ottawa this sixteenth day of September, 1926.\n(Sgd.) H. L. DRAYTON,\nActing Minister of Railways and Canals.\nTo the Registrar of the Exchequer Court of Canada, Ottawa. It will be observed that the claim which is referred to the Exchequer Court is a claim for compensation \"alleged to be due by reason of the allegations set forth.\" The claim itself is in these words:\nClaim of Dominion Building Corporation annexed to Reference, September 4, 1926.\nTORONTO, ONT., September 4, 1926.\nThe Honourable the Minister of Railways and Canals,\nDepartment of Railways and Canals,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDEAR SIR,\u2014In November of 1924, negotiations were begun for the purchase of the property on the corner of King and Yonge streets, in the city of Toronto, belonging to the Canadian National Railways, and, ultimately, under an order in council which was passed on the 29th of July, 1925, a contract was entered into for the purchase of the lands in question, for the sum of $1,250,000,- the purchase to be completed on the 15th of September, 1925. It was a term of the order in council that, on obtaining possession of the premises on or before the 15th September, 1925, a twenty-six storey modern fireproof office building should be erected on the premises and on lands immediately adjoining the premises and formerly known as the Home Bank of Canada, Head Office site, such building to be ready for occupation for the Canadian National Railways, as tenant, on rentals and for the time mentioned in the order in council, the obligation of the Canadian National Railways being to rent, for the time and on the terms mentioned in the order in council, the ground floor and three of the floors of the building.\nIt was part of the original negotiation that the Customs and Excise Department should also rent five floors of the building on the terms and for a time which was agreed upon, and provision for such renting was to be made by order in council, and an order in council to give effect to such arrangement was actually prepared on the 3rd of September, 1925, but, not having been passed at the request of the Government, an extension of time to complete the purchase up to the 28th of September was asked for and was granted, it being expected that before that date the last-mentioned order in council would be passed. This order in council was not passed during the year 1025, and, from time to time, at the request of the Government, extensions of the time for completing the purchase were applied for and were granted. The last written extension fixed the time for completion at the 30th of December, 1925, because it was intended to have a session of Parliament in the month of November, when the Government expected to be able to pass the necessary order in council to make the contract completely effective.\nOn the 29th of December, 1925, the order in council providing for the leasing of five floors by the Customs and Excise Department not having been passed, and the House not having met, at the suggestion of the Government, a further extension of the time for completion was applied for.\nFinally, the order in council providing for the leasing of the floors in question by the Customs and Excise Department, was passed on the first of February, 1926, and, on the 6th of that month, the Right Honourable the Minister of Railways and Canals was notified that the purchase would be completed on or about the 10th of February, 1926. On the 9th of February, 1926, the Right Honourable the Minister, by letter, terminated the original contract.\nOn the 9th of February, 1926, the Executive of the Canadian National Railways, at a meeting held in Montreal, passed a resolution purporting to reduce the number of floors to be rented by the Canadian National Railways from the ground floor and three additional floors, to the ground floor and one additional floor.\nAfter the contract was entered into, the property known as the Home Bank property was purchased for the purpose of carrying out the contract at the price of $500,000 and subsequently a contract was entered into with Anglin-Norcross, Limited, for the construction of the building.\nBy the 22nd of January, 1926, $150,000 had been expended including payment on the purchase price of the Home Bank building, and $25,000 had been paid on, account of the purchase of the property from the Crown, and a very considerable sum had been expended in examination of titles, preparation of plans, and other necessary expenses.\nIt was well understood from the inception of the negotiations by the Right Honourable the Prime Minister, by the Right Honourable the Minister of Railways and Canals, the Honourable the Minister of Public Works, and by other members of the Cabinet, as well as by the Canadian National Railways, that the successful financing of this operation depended upon the leasing by the Canadian National Railways of the ground floor and three additional floors of the building, and also by the leasing by the Customs and Excise Department of the five other floors referred to in this letter, and it was well known that, until the passage of the necessary orders in council making it quite certain that the floors in question would be leased, definite arrangements which would enable the completion of the purchase could not be made, and it was because of such knowledge by the Government and the members of the Cabinet, that the Government requested that the applications for the extensions of time to complete the said contract, be made.\nThe refusal by the Right Honourable the Minister of Railways, on the 9th of February, 1926, to complete the said contract, which refusal was wholly unjustified, in view of the negotiations above detailed, will entail an immense loss upon the undersigned, who are the assignees of the original contractor, and who may be involved in protracted litigation, with the possibility of the recovery of heavy damages.\nNotwithstanding the refusal of the Right Honourable the Minister of Railways and Canals to complete the contract, the undersigned have, without prejudice to their rights, offered to and have always been ready and willing to carry out the said contract.\nThe amount which the undersigned have lost or are liable for, by reason of the cancellation of the contract, is $981,000, which includes the price of the Home Bank property, and which sum is hereby claimed, and the undersigned have the honour to request that this claim be referred to the Exchequer Court of Canada for assessment under the provisions of the Exchequer Court Act.\nWe have the honour to be, sir,\nFaithfully yours\n(Sgd.) DOMINION BUILDING CORPORATION LIMITED.\nPer J. P. ANGLIN. The Exchequer Court, by the explicit terms of the reference, was to pass upon the claim \u00abfor compensation alleged to be due by reason of the allegations set forth\" in this claim. Among the \" allegations there are these: that it was well understood that the successful financing of the project depended upon the \" leasing \" by the Customs Department of five floors of the building; that it was \" well known \" that\nthe successful financing of this operation depended upon the leasing by the Canadian National Railways of the ground floor and three additional floors of the building, and also by the leasing by the Customs and Excise Department of the five other floors referred to in this letter, and it was well known that, until the passage of the necessary orders in council making it quite certain that the floors in question would be leased, definite arrangements which would enable the completion of the purchase could not be made, and it was because of such knowledge by the Government and the members of the Cabinet, that the Government requested that the applications for the extensions of time to complete the said contract, be made.\nIt is not established as a fact, and I am satisfied it is not the fact, that the various extensions of time referred to were made\" at the request\" of the Government. These extensions of time were necessary for the purposes of the respondents, and were granted for their benefit.\nIt is not necessary to decide whether or not it was open to the respondents to claim before the Exchequer Court compensation upon the footing that the respondents could successfully have financed and carried out the contract with Forgie upon which the petition is based, in the absence of the acceptance of a lease by the Department of Customs, in the terms mentioned in the claim. An exceedingly heavy onus, at least, rested upon the respondents to show that the allegations to the contrary effect were not well founded. I agree that the weight of evidence, and the weight of probability arising from the evidence, is against the respondents upon this issue. It is quite clear, I think, that the Crown is right in its contention that from the moment Anglin became interested in the project he took over the management of the respondents' affairs. He first took up the matter of financing the project with McLeod. Here, he experienced so much difficulty, that he seems to have been obliged to turn his attention to the possibility of making a sale of the respondents' rights, and, so far as one can gather from the evidence, it would appear that, from the 25th of September, 1925, down to the middle of February, he was relying entirely on his contract with the Wrigleys for the financing of the Forgie contract; and, moreover, that he was never in a position to carry out his arrangement with Wrigleys.\nThe respondents give evidence of two sets of negotiations with a view to obtaining assistance in carrying out the Forgie contract; the first with McLeod, the second with the Wrigleys. In both cases the persons approached insisted upon the Customs lease as an essential condition of any arrangement. With the Wrigleys, there was an actual contract of which the condition was a term. Forgie's letter of the 23rd of October, 1925, shews that the respondents were relying upon the Wrigleys to provide the moneys for the purchase of the Home Bank property; and the evidence satisfies me that, down to the 19th of February, 1926, Anglin was still relying upon his arrangements with the Wrigleys for the purpose of enabling him to procure the carrying out the enterprise; and that the Wrigleys became satisfied in February that Anglin was not, and never had been, in a position to carry out his contract with them. It seems clear, moreover, that it was well understood by Anglin, as well as by the Wrigleys, that an extension of time for the completion of the building under the Forgie contract would be necessary. This, no doubt, was well known to the Minister of Railways.\nMy view is that, assuming the Minister of Railways had been correctly advised as to the legal position, and had acted in accordance with such advice, and had been ready to execute the lease in February under the constraint of such advice, notwithstanding his strong desire to refuse to do so, in which he must have been influenced by powerful reasons, it by no means follows that the order in council authorizing the execution of the Customs lease, which the Crown was under no legal obligation to grant, would have been acted upon. Still, of course, there was a possibility of fresh arrangements being made by Anglin for financial assistance on the basis of a completed contract with the Department of Railways, and a possibility, perhaps, that the Customs lease might even have been granted to the respondents, and, even that the time might have been extended for completing the building. The value of these possibilities, in my judgment, is the measure of the damages to which the respondents are entitled. I think the amount which my colleagues have agreed upon is a reasonable one.\nCANNON J.\u2014I have little to add to the very careful and t complete study of the facts and law prepared by my brother Hughes. Assuming, as we must after the judgment of the Judicial Committe of the Privy Council[4] , that there was a valid and binding contract existing between the parties in the terms of the offer of July 27, 1925, we only have to determine the damages recoverable by respondents as the natural and probable result of the breach of this particular agreement.\n1. Although the respondents had represented 'that they owned the Home Bank property, the fact is that, at the time of the breach, the property was yet to be acquired at a cost of $500,000.\n2. They had to pay to the appellant for the corner in question $1,250,000, which was $50,000 more than what had been paid by the Canadian National Railways, peak price ever paid for real estate in Canada.\n3. They had, besides, to build a twenty-six storey modern fireproof office building, which would have cost $2,105,000. They had, therefore, to find, to carry out their part of the agreement, at least $3,855,000.\nOn the other hand, the respondents claim that, on account of the breach, they lost the rentals that they expected to receive from the Canadian National Railways, $186,750 in each year from the 25th day of October, 1926, for the period of thirty years.\nThe Dominion Building Company was incorporated on or about the 9th of June, 1925, and all the capital stock, except a few qualifying shares, were owned by Forgie, who relied exclusively on the late Mr. Anglin to finance the matter. The latter was .a contractor and expected to make, at the expense of the respondents, a profit of $200,000 on the 'construction work, which, he says, was more than the average profit because, as he puts it, it was partly in compensation for advancing money. So that, .at the time of the breach, the respondents, in order to secure, first the improved properties, and, as a probable consequence, the possible rentals from the appellant, had to find and spend nearly $4,000,000. The respondents at that time had no assets, no cash in the treasury of the company and depended entirely for finances on advances to be made by Mr. Anglin or his construction company. This service had to be paid for by enhancing what would have been the normal cost of construction and giving to Mr. Anglin shares in the respondent's capital structure. It is in evidence that, at the time of the breach, the William Wrigley Jr. Co. Ltd. were willing to purchase through Anglin the two lots at the north-west corner of Yonge and King streets for $2,000,005, but were insisting for the transfer of the two government leases, of which, at the time, only one had been secured. This company also asked for changes in the conditions which the respondents were not in a position to fulfil.\nForgie says in his evidence that his remuneration for his work as a lobbyist or promoter was in the future consummation of the project. At the time of the breach, his remuneration was, therefore, not secured and, therefore, he could not lose it as a natural result of this first disappointment. The Dominion Building Corporation Ltd., the other claimant, seems to have been incorporated to allow Anglin and Forgie to fix with themselves the price to be paid to the contractor for erecting the proposed skyscraper. The voluminous evidence of damages offered by the respondent is mostly of paper values, possibilities and hopes covering a period of thirty years in the future, and assumes as a basis the completion in a given time and under pressure of a huge undertaking which was only in embryo at the time of the breach complained of. The record reveals a typical example of the kind of so-called business enterprise which was popular before the economic crash of 1929 and depended for success almost entirely upon the gullibility of the public. The so-called investors were expected to purchase bonds guaranteed by mortgage on buildings not yet in existence but to be erected on real estate purchased at the very highest prices. The only hope of such promoters was that the money spent in such extravagant way would eventually come from the pockets of the investing public whose good will and enthusiasm would be properly exploited by one of the numerous self-styled financial bankers who were then competing for projects of this kind. Under those circumstances, can it be said that the respondents were really deprived of a bargain when the Minister of Railways declined to go any further with the agreement which was, according to the respondents, one of the essential parts of their scheme? It must not be forgotten that, according to the agreement and respondents' offer, the latter were supposed, when they made the offer, to be the owners of the Home Bank property. This was another essential ingredient of the whole scheme. In fact, they did not own the property at the time and never were able or willing to pay the price agreed upon with the liquidators of the Home Bank.\nMoreover, another very important element of the project was the second lease to be secured from the Customs Department; which was always lacking.\nWe must, therefore, eliminate as flowing naturally from the breach of this particular agreement the loss of profit that the respondents hoped to secure over a period of thirty years if they could pay for the Home Bank property, get the Customs lease and find someone to finance the funds required for that purpose and the completion of the building.\nThis is a case where it is impossible to regard the damages that are alleged to have followed the breach as that for which plaintiff is to be compensated, for the alleged injury to the plaintiff may depend on matters which have nothing to do with the defendant. Damages, in order to be recoverable, must be such as arise out of the contract and are not extraneous to it. Chaplin v. Hicks[5].\nThe damages claimed and considered by the learned trial judge were not the direct and natural consequence of this particular breach of contract. I have mentioned above some of the other factors which brought disappointment to the respondents. What was the actual cash value of the contract at the time of the breach, considering the heavy obligations which the agreement entailed for the respondents? The abortive sale to Wrigley does not seem to show that it could have been very advantageous to the respondents as sellers of their conditional right, in view of the helpless condition in which they were financially and otherwise. In order to carry on and perform their obligations to build within a very short delay, they both were practically at the mercy of Anglin and of all others who might be called to their rescue.\nRemembering, however, that there has been a breach of agreement, according to the judgment of the Privy Council, and that the respondents are entitled not to nominal but to general damages, I feel that the Court would be generous, as a jury, if a compensation of $75,000 be fixed. This would cover all the specific items mentioned in the claim, except the $25,000 paid on account, which has to be refunded to the respondents under the first judgment of this Court, which order was confirmed by the Privy 'Council.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal, reduce the recovery to $75,000, each party paying their own costs of this appeal.\nThe judgment of Crocket and Hughes JJ.- was delivered by\nHUGHES J.\u2014On September 4, 1926, Dominion Building Corporation Limited, per J. P. Anglin, wrote the Minister of Railways and Canals as follows:\u2014\nToronto, Ont., September 4, 1926.\nThe Honourable the Minister of Railways and Canals, Department of Railways and Canals,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir,\u2014In November of 1924, negotiations were begun for the purchase of the property on the corner of King and Yonge streets, in the city of Toronto, belonging to the Canadian National Railways, and, ultimately, under an order in council which was passed on the 29th of July, 1925, a contract was entered into for the purchase of the lands in question, for the sum of $1,250,000, the purchase to be completed on the 15th of September, 1925.

H. L. DRAYTON,\nActing Minister of Railways and Canals.\nTo the Registrar of the Exchequer Court of Canada, Ottawa. Filed the 23rd September, 1926.\nOn November 24, 1926, an Order in Council was passed purporting to withdraw the reference. On March 1, 1927, the respondent (the present appellant) moved before the President of the Exchequer Court of Canada for an order granting leave to the respondent to withdraw the reference on the ground that it was irregular, not having been made by the Minister of Customs, or the Minister of Public Works as well as by the Minister of Railways and Canals, upon the further ground that the amount of damages claimed in the letter of September 4, 1926, was substantially smaller than that claimed in the statement of claim, and upon the further ground that the respondent was entitled to withdraw the reference under the Act and particularly under rule 109 of the Exchequer Court Rules. On March 2, 1927, the learned President dismissed the motion[6]. From this decision an appeal was taken to this Court which allowed the appeal in respect of the first ground and held that the Exchequer Court was without jurisdiction[7]. An appeal was taken from this decision to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council and the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada was restored[8]. On March 4, 1931, the learned President of the Exchequer Court of Canada gave judgment in favour of the claimants for damages to be assessed for breach by the present appellant of a contract in writing made in July, 1925[9]. This judgment was reversed by this Court[10], and subsequently restored by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council[11]. The assessment of damages duly came on for hearing before the learned President, who, on April 6, 1934, awarded the claimants $400,000 and costs.\nFrom the latter judgment, the respondent now appeals to this Court.\nThe facts are set out very fully in the reports above enumerated and in the judgment appealed from, and it is not advantageous to repeat them in detail again.\nIt was contended before us by the appellant that the judgment appealed from was in error in the following respects:\u2014\n(1) In not finding that the respondents were never in a position to finance the project.\n(2) In holding that completion of the building by 25th October, 1926, was not required by the contract.\n(3) In finding that the building could have been completed by such date.\n(4) In not holding that, even if the project had been carried out, it would have resulted in no profit to the respondents.\n(5) In taking into consideration items that should have been disregarded.\n(6) In not holding that the respondents were entitled to nominal damages only.\n(7) In assessing damages on a wrong principle.\n(8) The damages awarded were grossly excessive. It will be convenient to take up these various contentions in the above order.\n1. In not finding that the respondents were never in a position to finance the project.\nThe learned President thought that it was reasonably safe to hold, and he did in effect hold, that the claimants with the assistance of J. R. Anglin could have financed the whole undertaking upon some plan or other. The latter was a contractor of thirty or forty years' experience. He was President of Anglin-Norcross Limited, an extensive contracting company which had built in recent years in Toronto alone such large structures as Royal York Hotel, Canada Permanent Building, Canadian Bank of Commerce Building and Canada Life Assurance Building. Anglin had been building in Toronto for about twenty years. He had, of course, also built extensively in the city of Montreal, the city of Quebec and elsewhere. Early in 1925, he was approached by the respondent, James L. Forgie, or by the architect, Eustace G. Bird, to verify the cost of the proposed building, and later to ascertain if Anglin-Norcross Limited would be interested in associating itself with the project. On May 2, 1925, Forgie wrote Anglin that, in consideration of his advancing the money necessary to secure 'an option on the Home Bank property to the west and $25,000 as a part payment on the purchase price of the corner property, he would, on completion of the contract to purchase, assign the option and contract respectively to a company to be incorporated and would cause the company to enter into an agreement with Anglin-Norcross Limited for the 'construction of the building and would deliver to Anglin \"25 per cent in fully paid shares\" of the capital stock of the company. On May 6, 1925, Anglin-Norcross Limited paid $10,000 at the request of Forgie to secure for the latter the option on the Home Bank property. Later, in pursuance of the \"foregoing, Anglin-Norcross Limited advanced the $25,000 referred to in the offer to purchase the corner property dated July 27, 1925, from Forgie to the appellant which offer was accepted by Order in Council dated July 29, 1925, as found by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council[12]. On August 7, 1925, the contract for the erection of the building was completed between Anglin-Norcross Limited and Dominion Building Corporation Limited. Anglin at the trial estimated the profit to his company at over $200,000 had the building contract been carried out and completed. C. D. Harrington, Vice-President and General Manager of Anglin-Norcross Limited, an engineer who had been with Anglin since 1907 and who had built the buildings above enumerated and many others, testified that he considered that Anglin's estimate of the profit in the contract was correct. The date for closing the 'contract and for delivery of possession of the corner property was, according to Forgie's offer of July 27, 1925, and the Order in Council of July 29, 1925, the 15th day of September, 1925. On September 14, 1925, Forgie or Dominion Building Corporation Limited, to which Forgie had assigned the contract with the present appellant, asked for an extension of time for closing on the ground that delay had been caused by financing arrangements. On September 16, 1925, the time for closing was extended by the appellant to September 28, and on September 19 the appellant vacated the corner property. On September 25, William Wrigley Jr. Company Limited made an offer to Anglin to purchase the corner property and the Home Bank property. This offer is not long and it is simpler to set it out than to attempt to summarize it. The offer is as follows:\u2014\nTo. Jas. P. ANGLIN, Esq., Toronto.\nWe hereby offer to purchase from you the properties at the northwest corner of Yonge & King streets, Toronto, described in Schedules hereto attached it being understood and agreed that the properties are contiguous for the price or sum of Two Million and Five Thousand Dollars ($2,005,000.00) payable as follows: Six hundred and five thousand dollars ($605,000) in cash on the date of closing, and the balance by giving mortgages on the Government and Home Bank properties for One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) and Four Hundred Thousand Dollars ($400,000.00) respectively payable on the 1st day of January, 1927, with interest half-yearly at five per cent per annum, with right in each to pay off at any time without notice or bonus, and to remove all buildings, the taking of the mortgage by the Government to be duly authorized.\nProvided the titles are good and free from encumbrance, except local rates; said titles to be examined by us at our own expense, and we are not to call for the production of any Title Deeds, or Abstract of Title, Proof or Evidence of Title, or to have furnished any copies thereof, other than those in your possession or under your control.

Ross, President.\nWitness:\n(Signed) ARCHIBALD FOULDS.\nOn September 28, 1925, the appellant granted the request of the respondents for an extension of time for closing until October 12, 1925. On September 30, 1925, Forgie wrote the Deputy Minister of Railways and Canals that he had agreed with J. Allen Ross, President of Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company Limited, to assign to him the property and the benefits of the lease and asked for changes in the lease as requested by Ross. On October 1, 1925, Anglin accepted the offer of Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company Limited subject to a variation that the mortgage on the Home Bank property should be $300,000 instead of $400,000 and the cash payment increased $100,000 accordingly. Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company Limited confirmed the variation on the same day. On October 2, 1925, the Deputy Minister wrote Forgie that his Department could not consent to any changes in the lease. On October 9, 1925, Forgie asked an extension until October 19 on the ground that Wrigley's solicitors had served him with requisitions on title requiring considerable work. On October 10, 1925, the Deputy Minister granted this extension. On October 17, Forgie wired the Deputy Minister of Railways and Canals for an extension to October 26, 1925, and the latter granted the extension. On October 23, 1925, Forgie wrote Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company Limited, that the purchase price of the properties payable to the appellant and to the National Trust Company (for the Home Bank property) was to be provided by Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company Limited and that the latter company must make good any loss sustained by reason of delay in closing. On October 23, Forgie wired the Deputy Minister for an extension until November 9, and on the next day the Deputy Minister granted an extension to November 3. On November 3, Forgie wired the Deputy Minister for an extension to November 17 which was granted. On November 10, Forgie wrote Mr. Gerard Ruel, K.C., Vice-president and General Counsel of the Canadian National Railways, for the desired changes in the draft lease. On November 13, Mr. Ruel replied that no changes could be made in the draft lease without submission to the Board. On November 16, Forgie wrote the Deputy Minister for an extension until December 30, which was granted next day. On December 29, Forgie wrote the Deputy Minister for an extension to January 31, 1926, to which there is no reply in the record. On January 12, 1926, Anglin wrote Ross that he had information that the railway president desired to reduce the amount of space to be taken and that such a reduction might involve raising the price of the ground floor to $19 or more to offset the reduction, that he would follow up the matter and that plans on steel work were proceeding. On January 29, 1926, Anglin-Norcross Limited per J. P. Anglin wrote Ross that \"all of the required changes in connection with the second order\" had been approved, and that, should they be able to negotiate adjustment of the \"railway portion\" on Monday, everything would be in readiness to proceed immediately. It is here helpful to quote from the judgment of the Judicial Committee[13], as to what took place between Forgie and the Minister of Railways about this time:\u2014\nThe appellant Forgie stated in the box that he saw Mr. Graham, the Minister of Railways and Canals, in January, 1926. His account of what took place was as follows: \"I had a conversation with Mr. Graham about this matter. The conversation at the outset was purely personal. I told him I had written for this extension and was very much exercised over the fact that I had not heard about it, and he said: `I do not see what cause you have to worry, Forgie, I have not cancelled your contract.' I said: 'I am very glad to hear that but I would like to have it in writing.' He said: There is no necessity to worry\u2014the matter stands as it did.' \" This evidence was not shaken in cross-examination, in the course of which the witness, when asked whether he discussed with Mr. Graham the fact that he had not yet got through the matter of the lease to the Department of Customs and Excise, answered, \" We discussed the whole thing from beginning to end.\" Mr. Graham admitted that he knew what was taking place with regard to the proposed lease to the other Department, but he also said, \" I have no recollection of having a conversation with Mr. Forgie, and if he seriously says that I had I will not dispute it, but if he makes a suggestion that this contract would be extended I absolutely deny that.\"\nThe Courts below do not appear to have expressed any view as to the proper conclusion of fact to be drawn from the evidence as to this interview, but if such an interview did take place, it affords some explanation of the absence of an answer to the application of December 29, 1925, which absence is otherwise unexplained.\nOn February 1, 1926, an. Order in Council was passed on the recommendation of the Minister of Public Works granting authority for the leasing of the fifth to the ninth floors, both inclusive, of the building in question at $110,000 per annum, for ten years from October 1, 1926, with option of renewal for a further period of ten years at the same rate. On February 3, 1926, Forgie wrote the Minister of Railways that he would be ready to close the purchase on February 10. On February 8, 1926, the Minister wrote Forgie that he had failed to close on the contract date and on the date of each extension and that the failure was not that of the Government or the Canadian National Railways. On February 10, 1926, Forgie wrote the Minister that he was ready to close, that Wrigleys were insisting upon Anglin and Dominion Building Corporation Limited completing their contract with them and that they were threatening action, and that Forgie would have to apply for a fiat. On February 12, 1926, the Minister wrote Forgie that there would be no more extensions and that he would oppose the issue of a fiat. The letter concluded with the following:\u2014\nIf you and your friends are wise you will not \" delay in closing with the Canadian National Railways for whatever space they may wish to contract for\" because at the termination of the period named by the executive of the Canadian National Railways, the property will either be sold to other parties who are negotiating for it or will be reoccupied by the Company.\nOn February 15, 1926, Forgie wrote the Minister of Railways urging that failure to close on the last extended date was not due to any default on his part or on the part of those he represented. He went on to state that the Government in 1925 had decided to lease five floors for other departments, that this was one of the factors in financing and that the Order in Council was not passed until February 1, 1926. On February 20, 1926, the Minister of Railways wrote Forgie that the latter could not be allowed to mix up the contract with the proposed lease of five floors for the Public Works Department. Further correspondence also took place between Anglin and Ross, the result of which was that the Wrigley contract was cancelled, Anglin returning or agreeing to return the deposit.\nThe learned President gave credit to the evidence of the claimants' witnesses, J. A. Gibson and Frank McLaughlin. Gibson testified that the autumn of 1926 and the spring of 1927 were good times for the landlords in leasing office space in downtown Toronto. This building was to have been erected at the corner of the better side of Yonge Street and the better side of King Street, in Gibson's opinion, then the best retail and financial streets respectively in Toronto. At that time, he said, the financial centre of Toronto was at Yonge and King Streets. It was later that the Imperial Bank and the Bank of Nova Scotia bought at Bay and King Streets and that such important buildings as the Canada Permanent Building, Canadian Bank of Commerce Building, Sterling Tower, Star Building and Concourse Building were erected west of Yonge Street. If this building had been erected, it would, in his opinion, have kept the financial centre at King and Yonge Streets much longer and some of the other buildings would probably not have been erected. The project, in his opinion, would have been almost as good without the Customs lease as with it because there would not have been difficulty in renting the space at similarly favourable figures. Gibson prepared a statement of his estimate of the gross rental revenue of the building with the government lease of the main floor and three upper floors but without the customs lease as follows:\nMain floor at $16 per sq. foot and three upper floors at $3 per sq. ft\n$186,750\n22 upper floors at $2.50 per sq. ft.\n385,000\nBasement at $2 per sq. ft.\n11,500\nConcessions\n1,200\nGross Annual Revenue\n$584,450\nFrom which would be deducted-10 per cent for vacancies, failures, on all space not leased to the Government ($397,700)\n39,770\n$544,680\nTaxes, insurance, and operating charges\n181,980\nLeaving as a net annual operating surplus\n$362,700\nThe learned President found that the sum of $181,980 was a fair approximation for taxes, insurance and operating charges. Gibson considered that the above approximate returns could be had during the life of the building. McLaughlin estimated the net annual surplus at $362,050 for thirty years. W. H. Bosley, an experienced real estate man but not as experienced as Gibson in such buildings as the one contemplated, placed the rental for the upper floors at $2.25 per square foot. The difference in the gross annual rentals as estimated by Gibson and McLaughlin for the respondents and Bosley for the appellant was only about $40,000. All three agreed that in a project of this kind it is in practice required to have a net operating revenue sufficient to pay annually six per cent on the cost of the land and nine per cent on the cost of the building and Gibson said that the latter includes enough to amortise the cost of the building at the end of its estimated life, namely, thirty-three years. The purchase price of the corner property was $1,250,000 and the option price of the Home Bank property, $500,000, making a total of $1,750,000 for the land. The cost of the building as estimated by the respondents' witnesses was $2,050,000 made up as follows:\u2014\nBuilding\u2014\nContract price for building\n$1,725,000\nArchitect's fees\n103,500\nTaxes on land during construction\n18,000\nInterest during construction\n90,000\nCost securing first mortgage loan\n26,850\nLegal fees and extras\n86,650\n$2,050,000\nSix per cent on the cost of the land amounts to $105,000. If this sum is deducted from the estimated net revenue of $362,700, there is a balance of $257,700. Gibson capitalized the latter sum at nine per centum, making $2,863,333, and making the value of the project slightly more than $4,600,000. Gibson; McLaughlin and Bosley all agreed that revenues were the best test of value. The six per centum on the cost of the land and nine per centum on the cost of the building amounted, according to Gibson's figures with which McLaughlin substantially agreed, to $289,500 per year. This deducted from the estimated net annual operating surplus of $362,700 left a net surplus annually of about $73,000 during the anticipated life of the building, the present value of which at five per centum is more than $1,000,000 and at six per centum more than $900,000. Bosley, for the appellant, arrived at a net annual surplus of $2,635 but the learned President was not satisfied with his treatment of certain costs. Bosley also allowed for an annual sum for depreciation of the building of $26,470. If Bosley's depreciation allowance of $26,470 had not been deducted, his annual surplus would have been $29,105, the present value of which for thirty years is upwards of $400,000.\nD. I. McLeod, of McLeod, Young and Weir, testified in behalf of the respondents before the learned President that his firm had handled the major financing of many large buildings. He said it would be safe to underwrite a bond issue on the project up to sixty per centum of a valuation of $4,600,000 made by the firms represented by Gibson and McLaughlin respectively or either of them. To take up the first mortgage bonds and the second mortgage bonds, both the railway lease and the customs lease would have been essential; but he would have been prepared to purchase the first mortgage bonds without the customs lease. The price was not settled. If Anglin-Norcross Limited had taken up the junior securities, there would not have been, he said, the slightest difficulty in financing. However, the negotiations fever reached an agreement.\nJ. P. Anglin testified before the learned President that in February, 1926, he or Anglin-Norcross Limited was in a position to pay over the $1,225,000 to the appellant to close the transaction. He had a \"set-up\" of the proposed financing, which was as follows:\u2014\nDOMINION BUILDING CORPORATION LIMITED\nFinancial Statement\nCanadian National Railways Lease\n$186,750\nBasement\n15,000\nCommissions\n2,750\n22 floors, 7,000 ft. each, at $2.75\n$423,500\n5 per cent vacancies\n21,175\n402,325\nIncome total\n$606,825\n1st M. Bonds $3,250,000 at 6 per cent\n195,000\nGenl. M. 1,150,000 at 7 per cent\n80,500\nOperation\n175,000\n$450.500\n$450.500\nNet Income\n$156,325 He said the location was the best and the project the finest that was ever contemplated. There does not appear to be evidence other than the foregoing as to the source of the money to pay the balance due for the Home Bank property or to take up the junior securities. The learned President said that it was reasonably safe to hold, and he did in effect hold, that the respondents with the assistance of Anglin could have financed the whole undertaking upon some plan or other. The learned President said that it was not clear whether Anglin's firm was willing to take up the junior securities, but that D. I. McLeod had stated that there would have been no difficulty in marketing senior securities to the amount of $2,760,000. The learned President said he assumed that Anglin or his firm would also furnish the money to take over the Home Bank property although, as he said, no mention of it was made in the evidence. It is not clear how Anglin proposed to market the $650,000 first mortgage bonds proposed in his \"set-up\" over and above the amount of $2,760,000 which D. I. McLeod said he could finance. Nor does Anglin explain the inconsistency between his proposed \"set-up\" and the Wrigley contract, in reference to which he wrote, on the very eve of the breach, namely, on January 29, 1926, to Ross reporting progress towards closing with the appellant. It was possibly not called to the attention of the learned President that, as above set out, Anglin on September 4, 1926, wrote the Minister of Railways and Canals on behalf of the Dominion Building Corporation Limited and set out, with the care which must have been given to a claim of that magnitude, a summary of the salient facts; a claim for $981,000 for breach of contract and a request that the claim be referred to the Exchequer Court of Canada. In that letter, as above stated, above the signature of Anglin appeared the following statements:\u2014\nIt was well understood from the inception of the negotiations by the Right Honourable the Prime Minister, by the Right Honourable the Minister of Railways and Canals, the Honourable the Minister of Public Works, and by other members of the Cabinet, as well as by the Canadian National Railways, that the successful financing of this operation depended upon the leasing by the Canadian National Railways of the ground floor and three additional floors of the building, and also by the leasing by the Customs and Excise Department of the five other floors referred to in this letter, and it was well known that, until the passage of the necessary orders in council making it quite certain that the floors in question would be leased, definite arrangements which would enable the completion of the purchase could not be made, and it was because of such knowledge by the Government and the members of the Cabinet, that the Government requested that the applications for the extensions of time to complete the said contract, be made.\nAs already stated, on September 16, 1926, the Acting Minister of Railways and Canals referred to the Exchequer Court of Canada \"the annexed claim of the said Dominion Building Corporation, Limited, for compensation alleged to be due by reason of the allegations therein set forth.\" The claim and reference were of the very foundation of the present litigation. It follows that the proposed Customs lease must be taken into consideration as, in the words of the Dominion Building Corporation Limited per J. P. Anglin on September 4, 1926, the successful financing of the project depended upon both leases. Both leases were required by Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company Limited. It is quite possible that the Minister of Public Works might have utilized the authority given to him in the Order in Council of February 1, 1926, to lease the five floors; but that was not more than a possibility or a probability.\n2. In holding that the completion of the building by October 25, 1926, was not required by the contract.\nThis contention of the appellant is not important in this appeal because of the finding of the learned President on reasonable evidence that Anglin-Norcross Limited could have completed the building by October 25, 1926, in the absence of strikes, riots or unforeseen circumstances of that kind. The witness C. D. Harrington has already been referred to. His experience in erecting large structures of this kind was so great that the finding of the learned President that Anglin-Norcross Limited was probably so efficiently organized and of such financial strength that it could have completed a rush job of that kind more quickly than most building concerns in Canada, cannot lightly be interfered with 'by an appellate tribunal. Harrington swore emphatically that his company was ready at the time of the breach to undertake to do the job by October 25, 1926, and to furnish a performance bond. There was, of course, much evidence that the building could not be completed by that time. The record ,spews, as above indicated, that at the time of the breach, negotiations for sale were still proceeding between Anglin and Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company Limited, that building permits still had to be secured and arrangements made for light over the Bank of Montreal building at the west. It is not easy to believe that Harrington could have completed the building, after the above preliminary arrangements had been made, by October 25, 1926, but the learned President on conflicting evidence believed Harrington and found that he could have so done and that, it seems to me, is conclusive on this point, subject, of course, to what has been said on the necessity for both leases.\nThe remaining contentions of the appellant concern directly or indirectly the quantum of damages.\nIn Robinson v. Harman[14], the defendant with knowledge that he had no title agreed to deliver to the plaintiff a valid lease. At the trial Lord Denman, C.J., allowed the plaintiff the 'expenses he had been put to and also damages for loss of his bargain. An appeal from the decision was dismissed. In the judgment on appeal, the often quoted words of Parke B. on this subject are found:\u2014\nThe rule of the common law is, that where a party sustains a loss by reason of a breach of contract, he is, so far as money can do it, to be placed in the same situation, with respect to damages, as if the contract had been performed.\nShortly afterwards was decided the very important case of Hadley v. Baxendale[15]. The plaintiffs in that case were millers and mealmen and proprietors and occupiers of a mill run by a steam engine. The crank shaft of the engine broke and the plaintiffs, having ordered a new one, gave the broken shaft to the defendants, who were common carriers, to be delivered at once to the machinery firm. The defendants' clerk was told that the mill was stopped and that delivery must be specially hastened. Delivery was delayed and a loss of profit arose from the enforced idleness of the mill. It was held that such loss could not be recovered. The judgment of the court\u2022 was 'delivered by Alderson B., who said the damages for breach of contract ought to be such as might fairly and reasonably be considered as arising either naturally, i.e., according to the usual course of things from such breach of contract itself; or such as might reasonably be supposed to have been in the contemplation of both parties at the time they made the contract as the probable result of a breach of it. If the special circumstances under which the contract was made were communicated by the plaintiff to the defendant, the damages resulting from the breach of such a contract, which they would reasonably contemplate, would be the amount of injury which would ordinarily flow from the breach under the special circumstances so communicated and known. If, on the other hand, the special circumstances were unknown to the defendant, he, at the most, could only be supposed to have had in his contemplation the amount of injury which would arise generally and in the great majority of cases not affected by any special circumstances from such breach of contract. In Engell v. Fitch[16] , Channell and Cleasby, BB., Byles, Montague Smith and Brett, JJ., concurred in the judgment of Kelly C.B. in the Exchequer Chamber. In this case, the defendants, mortgagees with a power of sale of a house, sold it by auction to the plaintiff, possession to be given on completion of the purchase. The title was satisfactory but the defendants refused to oust the mortgagor and the plaintiff brought an action for breach of the contract of sale. It was held, affirming the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, that the plaintiff was entitled to recover not only his deposit and the expense of investigating the title but also damages for the loss of his bargain; and that the measure of damages was the difference between the contract price and the value at the time of the breach and that the profit which the plaintiff could have made on a resale was evidence of this enhanced value. In the course of his judgment Kelly C.B. adopts the general rule as enunciated by Parke B. in Robinson v. Harman[17], and adds that Flureau v. Thornhill[18], qualified the rule of the common law to this extent that a vendor shall not be liable for any damages beyond the deposit and costs of investigating the title when he is unable to perform his contract by reason of his inability to make out a good title. The learned judge proceeds to say, page 667, that there is no authority to shew that when a breach of contract for the sale of real property has been on any other ground than that in Flureau v. Thornhill any other rule as to damages applies than that which prevails in the ordinary case of breach of contract. The learned judge then asks what damages would place the plaintiff in the same position as if the 'defendant's contract had been performed; and he points out that if the contract had been carried out, the plaintiff would have been possessed of property with an increased value of \u00a3105 and that it follows that he is entitled to damages for that amount. He adds that it may be suggested that such a view is contrary to Hadley v. Baxendale[19], but that, without saying that in all cases parties to the sale of real estate must be taken to have contemplated a re-sale, he thinks that if an increase in value takes place between the contract and the breach, such an increase may be taken to have been within the contemplation of the parties within the meaning of Hadley v. Baxendale. In McMahon v. Field[20], Brett L.J. says that the remoteness of damage has become a difficult one since, according to the case of Hadley v. Baxendale, it is for the court and not for the jury to determine whether the case comes within any of the following rules, namely, first, whether the damage is the necessary consequence of the breach; secondly, whether it is the probable consequence of the breach; and thirdly, whether it was in the contemplation of the parties when the contract was made. He then states that the question in the case is whether the fact of some of the horses taking cold after being turned out of stable by the defendant in breach of contract with the plaintiff, is within any of the rules. He adds that it was not the necessary consequence of the breach of contract, but that he had no doubt that it was a probable consequence, and, if so, it follows that it was in the contemplation of the parties within the meaning of the third rule. Cotton L.J. was of the same opinion. He adds in his judgment that parties never contemplate a breach, and the rule should rather be that the damage recoverable is such as is the natural and probable result of the breach of contract.\nIn Cunard v. The King[21], this Court considered, on an appeal from the Exchequer Court, the amount of compensation to be allowed an owner of land in Halifax, including a lot extending into the harbour. The lot could have been made much more valuable by the erection of wharves and piers for which, however, authority had to be obtained from the Dominion Government, and the question of the value of the chance or possibility of obtaining leave was considered at length.\nIn Chaplin v. Hicks[22], the Court of Appeal considered an appeal from a judgment in favour of the plaintiff. The respondent, an actress, secured a right by contract to belong to a limited class of competitors for a prize. It was held by the Court of Appeal, affirming the judgment, that a breach of the contract by reason of which the respondent was prevented from continuing as a member of the class and was thereby deprived of all chance of obtaining the prize was a breach in respect of which the respondent was entitled to recover substantial, and not merely nominal, damages; and that the existence of a contingency which was dependent on the volition of a third person did not necessarily render the damages incapable of assessment.\nWhether, in the case at bar, the Minister of Public Works would or would not have utilized the authority granted to him to lease the five floors for the Department of Customs is unknown. Successful financing depended on both leases, as is evident from the claim over Anglin's signature of September 4, 1926, and from the contract made by Anglin with Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company Limited (about which Forgie corresponded at length), which not only required both leases, but required certain changes in the Railway lease, to which the appellant never at any time agreed. For the Customs lease the respondents never had a contract but only a possibility or a probability. It follows that the award of the learned President must be set aside.\nAfter very lengthy consideration of all the circumstances, I am of opinion that $75,000 would be a generous amount and I would fix the damages at that figure.\nAs success is divided, there will be no costs of the appeal.\nJudgment of the Exchequer Court varied by reducing the damages to $75,000. No costs of the appeal.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W. Stuart Edwards.\nSolicitor for the respondents: R. V. Sinclair.\n[1] [1933] Ex.C.R. 164.\n[2] [19321 Can.

C.\nThe accused was convicted of manslaughter on a charge of murder for having caused the death of V. K. by counselling or procuring G. S. unlawfully to use instruments upon her with intent to procure her miscarriage, contrary to the combined effect of sections 69 and 303 of the Criminal Code. The dying declaration was a lengthy narrative by the deceased which day by day she related to her mother, who wrote down the story; this narrative, which concluded with the words \"I wish Carl punished,\" appeared to have been read over to the deceased shortly before her death and adopted by her at that time as a true statement; a number of questions at the same time were submitted to her by police officers, and her answers with the questions were the subject matter of two separate declarations. The narrative, together with the two short statements containing the questions and answers, were all put before the jury. It was common ground that the case against the accused could not be established without evidence of the dying declaration.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal ([1935] 2 W.W.R. 146) that the dying declaration was inadmissible. Therefore the conviction was quashed and a judgment and verdict of acquittal was directed to be entered.\nPer Lamont and Davis JJ.\u2014Assuming that the indictment could properly be said to be one for homicide (it is apparently one for the statutory offence of abortion), a great part of the narrative and the statements was outside the competence of a dying declaration in that many of the facts alleged and the wish expressed by the deceased were irrelevant as no part of the res gestae, extending far beyond the immediate circumstances of the death of the declarant, and were most harmful to a fair trial of the accused. Dying declarations are competent only in homicidal cases, and then only in so far as the statements therein could have been given in evidence by the deceased had she lived. To permit an entire statement to go to a jury, with instructions from the trial judge to disregard such portions as he might point out to be irrelevant and inadmissible, may in the case of a simple and short statement be proper, but in a statement in the form of a lengthy narrative it would be highly improper to permit the whole statement to go to the jury notwithstanding instructions from the judge as to the portions which he thought incompetent. In spite of instructions, the jury might easily be influenced against the accused. Per Cannon and Crocket JJ.\u2014In order to obtain the conviction of the accused on the indictment as laid, the Crown had to rely on section 69 (d) of the Criminal Code and prove first that he had counselled or procured the abortion. In order to prove this essential element and link the accused to the abortion and killing, the statements contained in the dying declaration could not be used. The accused's alleged relations with the woman G. S. is a subject-matter different from that of the immediate circumstances of the death of V. K. The statement of the deceased may perhaps be used to prove the cause of the death and the intervention of the abortionist's instrument, but could not be used as evidence that the accused had anything to do with the abortionist. Even if the dying declaration may have been admissible as a whole against the woman G. S. (which is at least doubtful) it certainly could not be used to prove circumstances, not directly and immediately connected with the fatal application of instruments which finally brought death.\nPer Dysart J. (ad hoc)\u2014The charge as laid was at most a charge of bringing about the death of V. K. by counselling or procuring G. S. to perform on V. K. an abortion resulting in the death. Under this specific charge, most of the statements contained in the dying declaration, alleging that the accused counselled or procured V. K. herself to bring about or undergo an abortion operation, were irrelevant and therefore inadmissible. The only statement that may have a bearing at all upon the charge as laid could not possibly support a conviction on that charge, and, therefore, ought to have been excluded. Thus all parts of the declaration are shown to have been inadmissible. If, however, any portion of it could be thought to be admissible, the admissible parts should have been placed before the jury, separate and apart from the document.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] affirming the conviction of the appellant for manslaughter, in a trial before D. A. McDonald J. and a jury.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nR. L. Maitland K.C. for the appellant.\nGordon McG. Sloan K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Lamont and Davis JJ. was delivered by\nDAVIS J.\u2014The real question in this appeal is as to the admissibility of a dying declaration. It is common ground that the case against the accused cannot be established without the evidence of the dying declaration. In the words of Byles, J., in Rex v. Jenkins[2] ,\nThese dying declarations are to be received with scrupulous, I had almost said with superstituous, care. The declarant is subject to no cross-examination. No oath need be administered. There can be no prosecution for perjury. There is always danger of mistake which cannot be corrected.\nHere the indictment in my opinion is not one for homicide but for the statutory offence of abortion (sections 69 and 303 of the Criminal Code). The sections of our statute which define and prescribe a punishment for abortion do not make the death of the woman one of the constituent elements of the offence. Where, however, as in some of the United States, the statutes provide for the punishment of abortions resulting in death, 1 Corpus Juris, p. 326, the woman's dying declarations have been admitted upon the ground that the death is an essential ingredient of the offence and the subject of the charge.\nAs early as 1824, in The King v. Mead[3] Abbott C.J. stated the general rule that evidence of dying declarations is only admissible where the death of the deceased is the subject of the charge and the circumstances of the death the subject of the dying declaration. In a footnote to the report of that case, Rex v. Hutchinson, tried before Bayley, J., at the Durham Spring Assizes, 1822, is referred to. There the prisoner was indicted for administering savin to a woman pregnant, but not quick with child, with intent to procure abortion. The woman was dead, and for the prosecution, evidence of her dying declaration upon the subject was tendered. The learned judge rejected the evidence, observing that, although the declaration might relate to the cause of the death, still such declarations were admissible in those cases alone where the death of the party was the subject of enquiry. Then in Regina v. Hind[4] , the accused was tried and convicted upon an indictment charging him with feloniously and unlawfully using certain instruments upon the person of one Mary Woolford, deceased, with intent to procure the miscarriage of the said Mary Woolford. On the trial, a dying declaration of the said Mary Woolford was tendered in evidence on the part of the prosecution and objected to on the part of the prisoner, upon the ground that the death of Mary Woolford was not the subject of the enquiry. Pollock, C.B., in delivering the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal, said:\nIn this case we are all of opinion that the dying declaration of the woman was improperly received in evidence. The rule we are disposed to adhere to, is to be found laid down in Rex v. Mead[5] . There Abbott C.J. said, \"The general rule is, that evidence of this description is only admissible where the death of the deceased is the subject of the charge, and the circumstances of the death the subject of the dying declaration.\" Speaking for myself, I must say that the reception of this kind of evidence is clearly an anomalous exception in the law of England, which I think ought not to be extended.\nThe conviction was quashed.\nIf the indictment here can properly be said to be one for homicide (though I do not think it can) the dying declaration is in fact a lengthy narrative by the deceased which day by day she related to her mother, who wrote down the story. This narrative, which concludes with the words \"I wish Carl punished,\" appears to have been read over to the deceased shortly before her death and adopted by her at that time as a true statement. A number of questions at the same time were submitted to her by police officers, and her answers with the questions were the subject matter of two separate declarations. The narrative, together with the two short statements containing the questions and answers, were all put before the jury. Upon any view of the matter, much of the narrative and the statements was plainly outside the competence of a dying declaration in that many of the facts alleged and the wish expressed by the deceased were irrelevant as no part of the res gestae, extending far beyond the immediate circumstances of the death of the declarant, and were most harmful to a fair trial of the accused. Clearly, dying declarations are competent only in homicidal cases, and then only in so far as the statements therein could have been given in evidence by the deceased had she lived. To permit an entire statement to go to a jury, with instructions from the trial judge to disregard such portions as he might point out to be irrelevant and inadmissible, may in the case of a simple and short statement be proper, but in a statement in the form of a lengthy narrative it would be highly improper in my view to permit the whole statement to go to the jury notwithstanding instructions from the judge as to the portions which he thought incompetent. In spite of instructions, the jury might easily be influenced against the accused. There is authority, on the other hand, for the Court entirely excluding such portions of the declaration as the judge might consider irrelevant and inadmissible, but in the case of a lengthy statement in the nature of a narrative (most of which is irrelevant and inadmissible) it would be difficult if not impossible to pick out certain sentences here and there to submit to a jury without altering the meaning which the same bore with the remainder in its orignal context, and such a course is too dangerous to adopt.\nThere being plainly no evidence upon which a conviction could properly be sustained without the admission of the dying declaration, the appeal must be allowed and the conviction quashed, and pursuant to section 1014 (3) (a) and section 1024 of the Criminal Code, a judgment and verdict of acquittal directed to be entered.\nThe judgment of Cannon and Crocket JJ. was delivered by\nCANNON J.\u2014The appellant was found guilty of manslaughter, with a strong recommendation to mercy, and sentenced to five years' imprisonment on the following indictment:\nThat he did unlawfully between the twenty-ninth day of August, in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and thirty-four, and the sixteenth day of September one thousand nine hundred and thirtyfour, at or near Greenwood, or Grand Forks, in the said county of Yale, counsel or procure a certain person, to wit, Grietje Sundquest, to commit an indictable offence, namely, to use unlawfully on the person of Veronica Kuva an instrument or instruments with intent to procure a miscarriage of Veronica Kuva, which offence the said Grietje Sundquest did commit and did thereby kill and slay the said Veronica Kuva against the form of the statute in such case made and provided and against the peace of our Lord the King, his Crown and Dignity.\nThe Court of Appeal of British Columbia dismissed his appeal on the 23rd of January, 1935[6] , and the formal judgment sets out that the Honourable Mr. Justice McPhillips dissented on the grounds in law that:\n(1) The dying declaration of Veronica Kuva was wrongfully admitted in evidence; or wrongfully admitted as to counselling; and\n(2) that the learned trial judge misdirected the jury respecting the said evidence of the said Veronica Kuva. All agree that if the dying declaration be inadmissible, there is no evidence upon which a jury could find against the appellant.\nThe learned dissenting judge first says that it is by no means clear that the dying girl made the declaration when in extremity and at the point of death. We are not in a position to decide this point, in view of the fact that the evidence of the circumstances surrounding the making and taking of the alleged dying declarations is not before us; moreover, the question whether the deceased had such a belief of impending death as to make her declaration admissible as a dying declaration was for the judge and not for the jury. We are unable from the record to say that the circumstances were such that the judge's decision to admit the statement of the deceased as a dying declaration was against the law.\nThe learned dissenting judge adds the following:\nIf it could be said successfully that the dying declaration is receivable in evidence all reference to counselling should be excluded from the declaration\u2014see Regina v. Horsford\u2014referred to in Regina v. Rowland[7] \u2014further admittedly it is the evidence of an accomplice and whilst it may well be said that the learned trial judge did give at first the proper warning to the jury\u2014he with great respect went on and said this\u2014which to my mind constituted a fatal error\u2014\n\"If keeping all these things in mind, the dangers, and the law as I have tried to give it to you, you say 'Well, I have thought this over 'carefully, the judge has told us we can do it if we see fit to do it. He 'has warned us of the danger, and warned us we ought not to do it, still 'we think in this case if there ever was a case we ought to convict.' If you feel that way, gentlemen, then it is your duty to convict, but be very, very careful.\"\nThis amounted to a direction to the jury that if they believed the evidence of the accomplice although uncorroborated it was their duty to convict the appellant. This course of action on the part of the trial judge was in effect to render nugatory the safeguard of the law\u2014that is, he in the end failed to give the proper warning to the jury as to the danger of convicting on the evidence of the accomplice without corroboration in a material particular implicating the appellant\u2014that being the case the conviction should be quashed\u2014Rex v. Tate[8] ; Rex v. Baskerville[9] ; Rex. v. Charavanamuthu.[10] .\nOur jurisdiction in this matter is limited to the questions of law raised by the learned dissenting judge as above.\nInstead of simply indicting the appellant with murder, or manslaughter, the Crown compounded a charge of coun- selling and procuring, between the 29th day of August and the 16th day of September, 1934, the abortionist to use unlawfully instruments with intent to procure the miscarriage of Veronica Kuva; and the indictment adds that the abortionist did commit the indictable offence charged, viz., the unlawful use of instruments, and did thereby kill and slay the person whose dying declaration was used against the appellant.\nIt is evident that the person who drew the indictment had in mind, first, section 69 (d) of the code and, secondly, used the terms of section 303 of the Criminal Code, which reads as follows:\n303. Every one is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for life who, with intent to procure the miscarriage of any woman, whether she is or is not with child, unlawfully administers to her or causes to be taken by her any drug or other noxious thing, or unlawfully uses on her any instrument or other means whatsoever with the like intent.\nThe date of the death of the girl is not mentioned in the indictment. This would seem to be an important ingredient, if the Crown Attorney had in mind a charge of homicide, in view of section 254 of the code:\n254. No one is criminally responsible for the killing of another unless the death takes place within a year and a day of the cause of death.\n2. The period of a year and a day shall be reckoned inclusive of the day on which the last unlawful act contributing to the cause of death took place.\nThere is no doubt that the charge, which is particularized, does not specify the requirements of section 259 of the code concerning murder. No malice aforethought is alleged. It did not even state that the appellant did counsel or procure an act which he knew or ought to have known to be likely to cause death. The indictment says that he counselled the unlawful use of an instrument with intent to procure a miscarriage; but does not say that he knew or ought to have known that this was likely to cause death.\nHowever that may be, and without deciding whether or not the combination or compound of these elements might constitute a charge of homicide, it is nevertheless true that, qua the appellant,, the Crown had to rely on section 69 (d) and prove first that he had counselled or procured the abortion; otherwise he was not amenable to answer for the happenings subsequent to the 16th of September. In order to prove this essential element and link him to the abortion and killing, can the dying declaration be used? His alleged relations with the woman Sundquest is a subject-matter different from that of the immediate circumstances of the death of Veronica Kuva. The statement of the deceased may perhaps be used to prove the cause of the death, the intervention of the abortionist's instrument, but could not be used as evidence that from August to the 16th of September the accused had anything to do with the abortionist. The alleged declarations were heard and taken on the 3rd and 4th of October, 1934, and covered events subsequent to the 16th of September, viz., the illness of the patient and the other facts connected with the fatal result of the abortion\u2014i.e., with the killing. It would be dangerous to allow such an extension of the exception to the law of evidence which admits in cases of homicide only, although hearsay evidence, the unsworn statement of the victim (whose death must be the subject of the charge) although such statement is not made in the presence of the accused and is not tested by cross-examination. Even if the dying declaration may have been admissible as a whole against the woman Sundquest (which is at least doubtful) it certainly could not be used to prove circumstances, not directly and immediately connected with the illegal application of instruments which finally brought death.\nIn Rex v. Gloster[11] , Charles J., upon an indictment for murder, by performing an illegal operation, statements made by a dying woman, in the absence of the prisoner, were held admissible as to contemporaneous symptoms of her bodily condition but nothing in the nature of a narrative was held admissible to show who caused them or how they were caused.\nThe Court of Appeal in Rex v. Thomson[12] approved this ruling and Lord Alverstone C.J., Darling and Avory JJ. quoted Charles J. as a great authority. I take this to be the law.\nMoreover, it is doubtful whether or not the only part of the declaration implicating the appellant as \"having, that night (2nd of September) talked to Mrs. Sundquest\" relates to a conversation in the presence of the girl, or is only hearsay as far as she is concerned. If only hearsay, she would not have been competent to testify about the alleged conversation if sworn in the cause; therefore, her declaration as to this matter would not be admissible.\nIn view of the above, it is not necessary to determine the second question raised by the dissenting judgment.\nWe will, therefore, allow the appeal; and, as there is no other evidence available against the appellant, direct a judgment and verdict of acquittal to be entered.\nDYSART J. (ad hoc)\u2014in dissenting from the majority of the learned judges of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia[13] , Mr. Justice McPhillips says: \"In my opinion the conviction herein must be quashed. Without the dying declaration there is no evidence upon which the jury could found their verdict\u2014and my view is that the dying declaration is inadmissible in law.\" The reasons for his dissent may be summarized thus: (1) that the declarant was not at the point of death when she made the declaration, or if she was, she did not realize it; (2) that the portions of the declaration relating to counselling are inadmissible in any event; (3) that the jury were not properly warned of the danger of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of the declarant, who was an accomplice.\nThis dissent involves several questions of law, any one of which, if the dissenting judge is correct, would be fatal to the conviction. The most important of these is the question of admissibility. While the right of a convicted person to appeal to this Court is confined to \"any question of law on which there has been dissent in the Court of Appeal\" which affirmed his conviction (section 1023 Cr. C.) this Court is not restricted on such appeal to the grounds or reasons upon which the dissent is based but may deal with the question of law entirely upon its merits.\nDying declarations are admissible in evidence only in cases of homicide, where the death of the deceased is the subject of the charge and where the circumstances of the death are the subject-matter of the declaration: Reg. v. Hind[14] . The first condition of admissibility of such declaration is that the charge laid against the accused, on whose trial the declaration is tendered, shall be one of homicide. Is that condition satisfied in this case?\nThe charge, which is set out verbatim in the reasons of Mr. Justice Cannon, need not be repeated here. it contains a direct allegation, and a statement of facts and consequences. The direct allegation is that the accused did\ncounsel or procure *** Grietje Sundquest to commit an indictable offence, namely, to use unlawfully on the person of Veronica Kuva an instrument or instruments with intent to procure a miscarriage of Veronica Kuva.\nThen follows\nwhich offence the said Grietje Sundquest did commit and did thereby kill and slay the said Veronica Kuva. ***\nIs the direct allegation of counselling or procuring sufficiently strengthened or buttressed by the succeeding words to constitute a charge of homicide? Every charge must be clear and unmistakable. Although section 852 of the Criminal Code dispenses with the need of technical language and unnecessary matter in charges, it does not dispense with the necessity of specifying the offence in \"words sufficient to give the accused notice of the offence with which he is charged.\" The offence so specified is the only one on which the accused can properly be tried, and the prosecution must confine itself strictly within the terms of the specifications. The specifying of the offence is equivalent to, or analogous with, the giving of particulars, and restricts the field of the prosecution. Where evidence is tendered which is outside of the confines of the specified charge, it is inadmissible for irrelevancy, and even though not objected to by counsel, should be excluded by the trial judge whose duty and responsibility it is to see that nothing but properly admissible evidence is placed before the jury. Although the charge, as here laid, seems to contain all the elements or factors of a charge of homicide, that alone is not enough to satisfy the requirements of such a charge.\nAssuming, without deciding, that the charge might be considered one of homicide, the most that can be said for it is that it is homicide by the specified means of counselling or procuring Mrs. Sundquest to commit the crime, thereby making the accused a principal party under s. 69. On this view any evidence tending to prove that the accused committed homicide by means other than the counselling or procuring of Mrs. Sundquest is irrelevant and inadmissible. The dying declaration, which is in writing, contains much matter which could not on any view be regarded as relevant to the circumstances of the death. These portions may or may not have been prejudicial to the accused on his trial. If. they were, they should have been excluded, and the exclusion of them would exclude the written declaration as a whole. Then there are statements lying nearer the circumstances of the death, but these have to do almost exclusively with transactions between the accused and the declarant herself. The efforts of the accused in counselling or procuring the declarant to undergo the illegal operation are therefore inadmissible on the grounds above stated. These statements are to the effect that the accused was responsible for the declarant's pregnancy; that after he had tried unsuccessfully to bring about miscarriage by counselling or procuring her to take certain pills, which she did take with intent to bring about miscarriage, he counselled her to go to Grietje Sundquest \"to get rid of the baby\"; that he handed her $20 to give to Mrs. Sundquest and said that if the sum were not enough he would give her more later; that he on one occasion conveyed her to the vicinity of Mrs. Sundquest's premises, and on other occasions supplied her with carfare for transportation to the same place. These and other such statements were inadmissible because irrelevant, and in as much as their effect upon the jury must have been prejudicial to the accused, ought not to have been admitted. Their exclusion would exclude the document as a whole.\nThe only statement contained in the declaration that bears at all upon the charge as laid is that the accused on the night of September 2 \"spoke to Mrs. Sundquest.\" It is not shown whether the declarant stated this from personal knowledge or from hearsay, nor is the subject of the conversation between the accused and Mrs. Sundquest mentioned. There is nothing to indicate that he at that time counselled or urged Mrs. Sundquest to bring about miscarriage. The inference is that the subject was not mentioned, as shown by another statement in the declaration, that the declarant when she first visited Mrs. Sundquest said \"my boy friend sent me\"\u2014a statement to which Mrs. Sundquest is not reported to have replied, and which suggests that the accused had not previously spoken to Mrs. Sundquest on the subject. Apart from these statements there is nothing in the dying declaration to show the accused had ever directly or indirectly communicated with Mrs. Sundquest. These statements could not possibly support a conviction on the charge as laid and, therefore, ought to have been excluded.\nThus all parts of the declaration are shown to have been inadmissible. If, however, any portion of it could be thought to be admissible, the admissible parts should have been placed before the jury, separate and apart from the document. This might have been done by witnesses using the document to refresh recollection and putting in the relevant or admissible portions in that form: Thiffault v. The King (1).\nIt is unnecessary to deal with the other questions raised on the dissent.

Damages were claimed from the Crown on the ground that the collision and fatality were due to the negligence of the occupante of the Government car. The case was heard on certain questions of law. Held: The Government car was not a \u201cpublic work,\u201d nor were its occupants acting within the scope of their duties or employment \u201cupon any public work,\u201d at the time in question, within the meaning of s. 19 (c) of the Exchequer Court Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 34). (Judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada, [1934] Ex. C.R. 195, reversed).\nHaving regard to the history of the legislation and the judicial decisions upon it (reviewed at length in the judgment), the phrase \u201cpublic work\u201d in s. 19 (c) means a physical thing having a defined area and an ascertained locality, and does not comprehend public service or employment, as such; nor does it include vehicles or vessels. This construction is further supported by the language of the French version of the section.\nSemble, where there is a \u201cpublic work\u201d in the sense above indicated, and an injury is caused through the negligence of a servant of the Crown in the execution of his duties or employment in the construction, repair, care, maintenance, or working of such public work, such an injury may come within the scope of s. 19 (c), though the servant\u2019s negligent act was not committed on the public work in the physical sense.\nAPPEAL by the Crown from the judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], deciding certain questions of law in favour of the suppliants.\nThe suppliants, by petition of right, claimed against the Crown the sum of $5,000 by reason of the death of their son, Albert Dubois Jr., due, it was alleged, to the negligence of certain servants of the Crown. The following facts of the case are taken from the reasons for judgment of the President of the Exchequer Court:\n\u201cThere is in the Department of Marine at Ottawa, what is known as the Radio Branch, and one important work carried on by this Branch, from coast to coast in Canada, is the detection and elimination of radio inductive interference. The extent of this particular work may be gathered from the Introduction to a Bulletin issued by that Branch in 1932, entitled \u201cRadio Inductive Interference,\u201d and from which it appears that over thirty thousand sources of radio interference have been investigated. The varied and important activities of the Radio Branch may be gathered from its Annual Reports, and the Radiotelegraph Act, Chap. 195, R.S.C., 1927.\n\u201cIn the investigation of radio inductive interference specially equipped motor cars owned by the Government of Canada are employed by the Radio Branch. In October, 1931, such a car, allocated for such work in the district surrounding Ottawa, was being used on a regular inspection tour for the detection of radio inductive interference, one Pollard being the radio electrician and investigator, and one Langlois the driver, both being regularly employed by the Radio Branch of the Department of Marine; Pollard and Langlois were on this occasion returning to their headquarters at Ottawa, from Fitzroy Harbour, when, towards the close of the afternoon, darkness, rain and fog rendered driving conditions so bad that they were obliged, while nearing the village of Britannia, to stop the car on one side of the travelled road in order to wipe the windshield. An oncoming car, in which Dubois the deceased was a passenger, collided with the Government car with fatal results to Dubois. The suppliants allege that the collision and fatality were due to the negligence of Pollard and Langlois.\u201d\nThe case was set down for hearing on the following questions of law raised by the pleadings, namely: (1) whether the said Government owned motor car, equipped and used as aforesaid and in occupation and control of the persons mentioned on the occasion in question, was at the time of the collision in question a \u201cpublic work\u201d within the meaning of s. 19 (c) of the Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 34; and (2) whether Pollard and Langlois were, at the time of the collision in question, officers or servants of the Crown acting within the scope of their duties or employment upon a public work, within the meaning of said s. 19 (c).\nIt was adjudged in the Exchequer Court that the motor car was at the time in question a public work within the meaning of s. 19 (c) of the Exchequer Court Act; and that the said Pollard and Langlois were at the time in question officers or servants of the Crown acting within the scope of their duties or employment upon a public work within the meaning of said s. 19 (c); and that the Exchequer Court had jurisdiction to entertain the petition of right.\nThe Crown appealed.\nF. P. Varcoe K.C. for the appellant.\nC. Morse K.C. and E. G. Gowling for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Duff C.J. and Cannon, Crocket and Hughes JJ. was delivered by\nDuff C.J.\u2014This appeal involves the construction of section 19 of the Exchequer Court Act (R.S.C. 1927, ch. 34). The enactment now before us, and the parent enactment which it reproduces in amended form, have been the subject of a considerable number of decisions in the Exchequer Court and in this Court.\nIt will appear as we proceed that the most effectual way of ascertaining the import of the language we have to construe is to note the course of legislation upon the subject matter of the enactment from 1870 onward, and to examine with some care the course of judicial decision upon that legislation.\nOne general observation will not, I think, be superfluous. The judicial function in considering and applying statutes is one of interpretation and interpretation alone. The duty of the court in every case is the intention of the legislature; and to ascertain that intention by reading and interpreting the language which the legislature itself has selected for the purpose of expressing it.\nIn this process of interpretation the individual views of the judge as to the subject matter of the legislation are, of course, quite irrelevant. To start with presumptions as to policy is, as Lord Haldane said in Vacher & Sons: Ltd. v. London Society of Compositors[2], to enter upon a labyrinth for the exploration of which the judge is provided with no clue.\nWe have before us an enactment which presents certain peculiarities. There is a remedy given against the Crown in a limited class of torts; and the reasons which actuated the legislature in prescribing the limitations cannot be stated with any kind of certainty. That is no ground for ignoring the limitations, or for ascribing a non-natural meaning to the words in which they are stated in order to minimize the effect of those words. A particular enactment of the legislature is sometimes, as everybody knows, the result of compromise\u2014a result which it would often be difficult to explain by reference to any broadly conceived principle of legislative action.\nIt is the duty of the courts to give effect to the language employed, having due regard to the judicial construction which it has received. The parent enactment of section 19 (c) of the Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C. (1927), cap. 34 (the section we have to construe and apply), was section 16 (c) of the statute of 1887 (50-51 Vict., ch. 16) (by which statute the Exchequer Court, in its present constitution, came into being); and section 19 (c), in the English version, received its present form by an amendment brought into force by section 2 of ch. 23 of the Statutes of 1917. The French version of section 19 (c) (in the R.S.C. 1927, cap. 34) was not mentioned in argument. That version, as will very clearly appear at a later stage, is most illuminating upon the question of construction. In the meantime, I shall, in my references to the statute of 1887, and the amendment of 1917, confine myself to the English version. Section 16 of the statute of 1887, which became section 20 in the Revised Statutes of 1906, was as follows:\n16. The Exchequer Court shall also have exclusive original jurisdiction to hear and determine the following matters:\n(a) Every claim against the Crown for property taken for any public purpose;\n(b) Every claim against the Crown for damage to property, injuriously affected by the construction of any public work;\n(c) Every claim against the Crown arising out of any death or injury to the person or to property on any public work, resulting from the negligence of any officer or servant of the Crown, while acting within the scope of his duties or employment;\n(d) Every claim against the Crown arising under any law of Canada or any regulation made by the Governor in Council.\nThe amendment of 1917 was in these words:\n2. Paragraph (c) of section twenty of the said Exchequer Court Act is repealed and the following is substituted therefor:\n\u201c(c) Every claim against the Crown arising out of any death or injury to the person or to property resulting from the negligence of any officer or servant of the Crown while acting within the scope of his duties or employment upon any public work.\u201d\nAn important change was effected in the law in the amendment of 1917; by the simple process of taking the phrase \u201con any public work\u201d from its place following \u201cproperty,\u201d and with the substitution of the preposition \u201cupon\u201d for the preposition \u201con,\u201d attaching it to the end of the paragraph, immediately after the word \u201cemployment.\u201d The phrase \u201cpublic work\u201d remained unchanged, a phrase which also appears, as will be noticed, in paragraph (6). It was early held (The City of Quebec v. The Queen[3]) that while in form section 16 (c) (of the Statutes of 1887) only conferred jurisdiction, it gave, nevertheless, by necessary implication, a substantive right of action to the subject.\nIt will be convenient, first of all, to consider section 16 (c) in its original form, and the decisions upon it prior to the amendment of 1917. The actual decisions of this court upon the enactment establish three propositions: first, that the phrase \u201con a public work\u201d served the office of fixing the locality within which the death or injury must occur in order to bring the enactment into operation; second, that the phrase \u201cpublic work\u201d denoted, not a service or services, but a physical thing; third, that such physical thing must have a fixed situs and a defined area.\nThe determination of the present appeal largely turns upon the meaning to be ascribed to the phrase \u201cpublic work\u201d in the existing statute, that is to say, in the form the statute, in its English version, assumed in consequence of the amendment of 1917.\nThe jurisdiction created by section 16 (c) of the legislation of 1887 was a jurisdiction transferred from the Official Arbitrators to the Exchequer Court (Graham v. The King[4]; Armstrong v. The King[5]). The jurisdiction of the Official Arbitrators in relation to this particular subject had originally been constituted by section 1 of chapter 23 of the Statutes of 1870; which provided that where there was a supposed claim upon the Government of Canada\narising out of any death, or any injury to person or property on any railway, canal, or public work under the control and management of the Government of Canada\nthe claim might, by the head of the department concerned therewith, be referred to Official Arbitrators who should have power to hear and make an award upon such claim.\nIn the Revised Statute of 1886, the Act relating to Official Arbitrators reproduced this provision in slightly altered form (ch. 40, sec. 6), the words there being:\nclaim * * * arising out of any death, or any injury to person or property on any public work;\n\u201cpublic work\u201d being thus defined by section 1, \u201cunless the context otherwise requires,\u201d\n(c) The expression \u201cpublic work\u201d or \u201cpublic works\u201d means and includes the dams, hydraulic works, hydraulic privileges, harbours, wharves, piers and works for improving the navigation of any water\u2014 lighthouses and beacons\u2014the slides, dams, piers, booms and other works for facilitating the transmission of timber\u2014the roads and bridges, the public buildings, the telegraph lines, Government railways, canals, locks, fortifications and other works of defence, and all other property which now belong to Canada, and also the works and properties acquired, constructed, extended, enlarged, repaired or improved at the expense of Canada, or for the acquisition, construction, repairing, extending, enlarging or improving of which any public money is voted and appropriated by Parliament, and every work required for any such purpose; but not any work for which money is appropriated as a subsidy only.\nSection 6 also gave jurisdiction to the Official Arbitrators, on reference by a Minister in respect of other matters:\n* * * any claim for property taken, or for alleged direct or consequential damage to property, arising from or connected with the construction, repair, maintenance or working of any public work, or arising out of anything done by the Government of Canada.\nSection 16 of the Exchequer Court Act of 1887, which, by section 58, repealed the Official Arbitrators Act (R.S.C. 1886, c. 40), gave to the newly created Exchequer Court jurisdiction in a modified form in respect of these matters. It is not without relevancy to note that claims for\nalleged direct or consequential damage to property, arising from or connected with the construction, repair, maintenance or working of any public work.\n(in the Official Arbitrators Act) become claims\nfor damage to property, injuriously affected by the construction of any public work\nin section 16 (6) of the Statute of 1887.\nThe decisions in this Court and in the Exchequer Court upon claims under section 16 (b) have proceeded upon the view that the words of that paragraph must be construed by reference to the decisions of the English courts in respect of the subject of \u201cinjurious affection\u201d (MacArthur v. The King[6]; The King v. MacArthur[7]). There can, I think, be no doubt that \u201cpublic work\u201d in that paragraph is to be construed by reference to the interpretation clause in the Official Arbitrators Act (R.S.C. 1886, c. 40) and to the interpretation clause in the Expropriation Act (R.S.C. 1886, c. 39) which correspond ipsissimis verbis. In that definition, it will be observed that the phrase \u201call other property which now belong to Canada\u201d is, if read alone, very comprehensive; but, as Burbridge J. held in Larose v. The Queen[8], that expression in the Expropriation Act, where, as I have already said, the definition precisely conforms to that in the Official Arbitrators Act, must be read in connection with the words preceding it, and not in the broadest possible sense.\nI entertain no doubt that \u201cpublic work,\u201d as employed in section 6 of the Official Arbitrators Act, and in the contemporaneous Expropriation Act, did not embrace any subject not falling within the definition quoted. Moreover, I have no doubt that when the jurisdiction conferred by that section was transferred, with the modifications noticed above, to the Exchequer Court by the Statute of 1887, the phrase \u201cpublic work,\u201d as employed in paragraphs (b) and (c) of section 16 of that statute, must be read and construed by reference to that definition. So read and construed, the term \u201cpublic work\u201d cannot be given the sense the respondent seeks to ascribe to it: of public service, employment or duty; nor can it fairly be read as comprehending such things as vehicles and vessels. This, we shall see, is the effect of the decisions of this court respecting the construction of these paragraphs.\nI now proceed to consider the decisions. In The City of Quebec v. The Queen[9], Mr. Justice Gwynne thus states his views as to the effect of section 16 (c) of the Statute of 1887:\nThe object, intent and effect of the above enactment was, as it appears to me, to confer upon the Exchequer Court, in all cases of claim against the government, either for the death of any person, or for injury to the person or property of any person committed to their charge upon any railway or other public work of the Dominion under the management and control of the government, arising from the negligence of the servants of the government, acting within the scope of their duties or employment upon such public work, the like jurisdiction as in like cases is exercised by the ordinary courts over public companies and individuals.\nIn the Queen v. Filion[10] Mr. Justice Sedgewick expressly adopted the view thus expressed. These words of Mr. Justice Gwynne, adopted by Mr. Justice Sedgewick, give no countenance to the suggestion that the phrase \u201cpublic work\u201d in the enactments under consideration should be construed in the sense of public employment or service.\nSince I came to this court in 1906 there have been a good many appeals involving the construction of this enactment. The first of these was in Paul v. The King[11], which was decided in the year 1906. The construction there laid down by Davies J., as the basis of his judgment (at p. 132), was expressed in these words:\nI think a careful and reasonable construction of the clause 16 (c) must lead to the conclusion that the public works mentioned in it and \u201con\u201d which the injuries complained of must happen are public works of some definite area, as distinct from those operations undertaken by the Government for the improvement of navigation or analagous purposes; not confined to any definite area or physical work or structure.\nThis, be it observed, was no mere dictum. It was concurred in by Mr. Justice Maclennan and myself and was deliberately adopted as the ratio of the decision by the majority of the court.\nThis decision in Paul v. The King in 1906[12], is conclusive upon the point that \u201cpublic work\u201d in the statute of 1887 did not bear the sense of public employment, public service, public labour, public business. The suppliant\u2019s steamship Pr\u00e9fontaine had been damaged in a collision with a loaded scow fastened to the side of the steam tug Champlain, which the latter was towing from the dredge Lady Minto, working in one of the channels of the St. Lawrence river. The dredge, the steam tug and the scow were all the property of the Government, and the claim was based upon section 16 (c). It was held that, assuming the collision was due to the negligence of those in charge of the tug Champlain, there was no remedy because the injury was not \u201con a public work.\u201d Now, the officers in charge of the tug were, admittedly, engaged on a public service, in a public employment. Construing \u201cpublic work\u201d in the sense contended for on behalf of the present respondent (as comprehending public service or employment), and assuming negligence, the statutory conditions were plainly satisfied. As I have already pointed out, the judgment of the court expressly rejected that construction; and I am now pointing out that the decision necessarily involved the rejection of it.\nMoreover, it was held by Mr. Justice Burbridge in the Exchequer Court[13] that neither the tug nor the scow was a \u201cpublic work\u201d within the meaning of the statute. His view, to which I shall have to advert later, was that the phrase \u201con a public work\u201d in the statute was sufficiently comprehensive to include the case of an injury occasioned by something done on the public work; although the injury itself did not occur there. The negligence of the officers navigating the tug was not, in his view, within that description, that is to say, was not something done on a \u201cpublic work,\u201d because the tug was not, at all events when separated from the dredge, a \u201cpublic work.\u201d\nIn the Supreme Court of Canada, the majority maintained the view that neither the dredge, nor the tug, nor the scow, was a \u201cpublic work.\u201d It may be observed at this point that in Montgomery v. The King[14] this was applied by Cassels J., who held that a dredge belonging to the Dominion Government was not a \u201cpublic work\u201d within the contemplation of section 16 (c).\nBefore passing from this decision, it is, perhaps, well to emphasize the principle of the decision, stated in the quotation from the reasons of Mr. Justice Davies, which were expressly adopted as the reasons of the majority of the court. \u201cPublic work\u201d is there defined in such a way as to exclude from its ambit public employment or public service, as such, and this, as I have said, was necessary to the decision; and, further, the decision is explicitly rested upon the proposition that \u201cpublic work,\u201d within the meaning of the statute, means a physical thing having a definite area.\nPaul v. The King[15] has been consistently followed; there is no decision of this court which is, in the slightest degree, at variance with it.\nThe next appeal in which the point arose was in The King v. Lefran\u00e7ois[16], and I there endeavoured to sum up the tenour of the previous decisions in their application to the case under consideration in these words:\nHaving regard to the previous decisions of this court, the phrase \u201con a public work\u201d in section 20, subsection (c), of \u201cThe Exchequer Court Act\u201d must, I think, be read as descriptive of the locality in which the death or injury giving rise to the claim in question occurs. The effect of these decisions seems to be that no such claim is within the enactment unless \u201cthe death or injury\u201d of which it is the subject happened at a place which is within the area of something which falls within the description \u201cpublic work.\u201d (Paul v. The King[17] and the cases there cited). I pause here to observe that the phrase \u201chappened at a place which is within the area of something which falls within the description \u2018public work\u2019,\u201d could hardly be read as contemplating a vehicle or a public service.\nThe section came before this court again in Chamber-lin v. The King[18]. The Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Girouard and Mr. Justice Idington adopted the phraseology of Lefran\u00e7ois\u2019 case[19] in the passage cited. The Chief Justice used these words (p. 351):\nIn a long series of decisions this court has held that the phrase \u201con a public work\u201d in sec. 20, subsec. (c), of the \u201cExchequer Court Act,\u201d must be read, to borrow the language of Mr. Justice Duff in The King v. Lefran\u00e7ois[20], at p. 436, \u201cas descriptive of the locality in which the death or injury giving rise to the claim in question occurs,\u201d and that to succeed the suppliant must come within the strict words of the statute. (Taschereau J. in Larose v. The King[21]. See also Paul v. The King (5), and cases there cited).\nMr. Justice Davies says (p. 353):\nWe are all of the opinion that the point has already been expressly determined by this court, particularly in the case of Paul v. The King[22]. In that case the majority of the court held after the fullest consideration that clause (c) of the 16th section of the \u201cExchequer Court Act,\u201d which alone could be invoked as conferring jurisdiction, only did so in the case of claims\n\u201carising out of any death or injury to the person or property on any public work resulting from the negligence of any officer or servant of the Crown while acting within the scope of his duties.\u201d\nClaims for injuries not within these words of the section and occurring, not on, but away from, a public work, although arising out of operations wheresoever carried on, were held not to be within the jurisdiction conferred by the section.\nMr. Justice Davies added,\nWith the policy of Parliament we have nothing to do. Our duty-is simply to construe the language used, and if that construction does, not fully carry out the intention of Parliament, and if a wider and broader-jurisdiction is desired to be given the Exchequer Court, the Act can easily be amended.\nMr. Justice Anglin and myself agreed with the views expressed by the Chief Justice, as well as with those expressed by Mr. Justice Davies.\nThe next case to which I shall refer is Olmstead v. The King[23], in which a claim was made for the flooding of lands in consequence of the negligent operation of a dam on the Rideau Canal. At pp. 456-7 of the report Mr. Justice Anglin said: The plaintiffs claim, however, is for damages for injuries sustained through the negligence of a Crown servant in carrying on a public work. The injury of which he complains did not happen on the public work. Section 20 (c) of the \u201cExchequer Court Act,\u201d therefore, does not confer jurisdiction on the Exchequer Court. Chamberlin v. The King[24]; Paul v. The King[25]. Since these cases were decided Letourneux v. The King[26] cannot be followed in such a case as this. In that case the full limitative effect of the words \u201con any public work\u201d in sub-sec. (c) of sec. 20 would appear not to have been sufficiently considered. The suppliant points to no other provision giving him a right of action against the Crown.\nBefore passing on to the next case, it is well to observe, perhaps, that Letourneux v. The King[27] (decided in 1903 before Paul v. The King[28]), mentioned in the judgment of Mr. Justice Anglin, is very imperfectly reported. Only two judgments are in evidence. There was there no question as to the meaning of the phrase \u201cpublic work.\u201d The injury complained of was, in part, the result of the negligence of employees of the Crown in failing to keep a siphon culvert clear and in proper order to carry off the waters of a stream which had been diverted and carried under the Lachine Canal. In part it appears to be a claim under paragraph (6) of section 16, for injurious affection. It is impossible now to ascertain what were the grounds on which the majority of the court proceeded.\nIn Piggot v. The King[29], Mr. Justice Cassels, President of the Exchequer Court, (at pp. 489-492) cited verbatim and applied the judgments of the Chief Justice and of Davies J. in Chamberlin v. The King[30], including the passages I have already cited from the latter. I quote what he said, verbatim, because his reasons were explicitly approved by one of the members of this Court:\nSection 20, subsection (c) of the Exchequer Court Act (R.S.C. 1906, c. 140) reads as follows:\n\u201cThe Exchequer Court shall have exclusive original jurisdiction to hear and determine: (c) Every claim against the Crown arising out of any death or injury to the person or to property on any public work.\u201d\nIn the case of Chamberlin v. The King[31], the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court says at p. 353:\n\u201cIn a long series of decisions this Court has held that the phrase \u201con a public work\u201d in section 20, subsection (c) of the Exchequer Court Act must be read, to borrow the language of Mr. Justice Duff, in The King v. Lefran\u00e7ois[32], \u201cas descriptive of the locality in which the death or injury (that is injury to property) giving rise to the claim in question occurs, and that to succeed the suppliant must come within the strict words of the statute. In this case the property destroyed by fire, previous to and at the time of its destruction, was upon the land of the suppliant, some distance from the right of way of the Intercolonial Railway and was not property on a public work. As to the objection that this question was not raised in the Court below, I refer to McKelvey v. LeRoi Mining Company[33]. If questions of law raised here for the first time appear upon the record we cannot refuse to decide them where no evidence could have been brought to affect them had they been taken at the trial. The point was taken by the pleadings if not urged at the argument below.\u201d\nSir Louis Davies says:\n\u201cThis was an action brought in the Exchequer Court on a claim for damages arising out of the destruction of the property of the suppliants claimed to have been caused by sparks from the smoke stack of an Intercolonial Railway engine.\n\u201cThe property destroyed was previous to and at the time of its destruction upon the land of the suppliant some distance from the right of way of the railway and was not property on a public work.\n\u201cThe learned Judge, Mr. Justice Cassels, who delivered the judgment of the Court of Exchequer, had not heard the witnesses, who had given their testimony before the late Judge Burbidge.\n\u201cThe suppliants were desirous to avoid the expense of a rehearing and with the assent of the respondent the case was fully argued before Mr. Justice Cassels on the evidence taken before Mr. Justice Burbidge.\n\u201cThe learned Judge found as a fair conclusion to be drawn from the evidence that the fire originated from a spark or sparks emitted from the engine, but he was unable to find that it was caused through any defect in the engine for the existence of which and the failure to remedy which the Crown could be held liable for the losses claimed. On this appeal the jurisdiction of the Court of Exchequer over the claim in question was challenged and denied by Mr. Chrysler, his contention being that such jurisdiction was limited to claims against the Crown arising out of injuries to the person or property on a public work, and did not extend to injuries happening away from a public work, although caused by the operations of the Crown\u2019s officers or servants. The cases in which the question has already come before this Court for consideration were all referred to.\n\u201cWe are all of the opinion that the point has already been expressly determined by this Court, particularly in the case of Paul v. The King[34]. In that case the majority of the Court held after the fullest consideration that clause (c) of the 16th section\u2014(that is the same as this is)\u2014of the Exchequer Court Act, which alone could be invoked as conferring jurisdiction, only did so in the case of claims arising out of any death or injury to the person or property on any public work resulting from the negligence of any officer or servant of the Crown while acting within the scope of his duties, claims for injuries not within these words of the section and occurring not on, but away from, a public work, although arising out of operations wheresoever carried on, were held not to be within the jurisdiction conferred by the section.\n\u201cWith the policy of Parliament we have nothing to do. Our duty is simply to construe the language used, and if that construction does not fully carry out the intention of Parliament, and if a wider and broader jurisdiction is desired to be given the Exchequer Court, the Act can easily be amended.\n\u201cUnder these circumstances we must, without expressing any opinion upon the conclusions of fact reached by the learned judge, dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAt this point, it is convenient to observe that, in the Supreme Court of Canada[35], in giving judgment in the appeal from Cassels J., this language is expressly adopted by Anglin J. in these words:\nI respectfully concur in the reasons assigned by the learned judge of the Exchequer Court for dismissing this action.\nAgain, in this court35, Mr. Justice Idington, at p. 630, used these words:\nThe words therein, \u201con any public work,\u201d rendered it impossible, in the case of Chamberlin v. The King[36], for us to interfere, solely because the injury, if any, was done to property a long distance from the place where the public work existed from which it was said the cause of the destruction of suppliant\u2019s property originated.\nHere, once more, the phrase \u201cplace where the public work existed\u201d is not a phrase that would be used in relation to a public service, or employment, or to a vehicle.\nIn La Compagnie Generale D\u2019 Entreprises Publiques v. The King[37], a derrick scow which was used for the purpose of making repairs to a wharf, that was, admittedly, a public work, was made fast to the face of the wharf. The scow was crushed and sunk owing to the negligence of the officers working a Government ferry. The view of Idington. J., and apparently of the Chief Justice, was that the locality of the scow was \u201con a public work.\u201d Anglin J. expressed the opinion that \u201cpublic work\u201d in section 16 (c) might be read as meaning \u201cany operations undertaken by or on behalf of the Government in constructing, repairing or maintaining public property.\u201d Such a view could not be reconciled with the decisions, already mentioned, which were binding on the court, and was not accepted by any other judge. The decision is of no assistance, and I mention it only because the observation of Anglin J. was relied upon. To that observation I shall revert later.\nBefore coming to the amendment of 1917, it is important, I think, to refer to some dicta by Mr. Justice Burbridge and some decisions of this court upon a question which arose at an early stage, that is to say, whether, if the in- jury in respect of which the claim was made was caused by something done on a public work, the claimant was entitled to the benefit of the statute, although the injury did not actually occur on the public work. Mr. Justice Burbidge expressed the view that in such a case the statute would apply (The City of Quebec v. The Queen[38]; in Price v. The King[39]; in Paul v. The King[40]). This view was negatived in this court in a number of decisions.\nTwo of these decisions, Chamberlin v. The King in 1909[41], and Piggott v. The King in 1916[42], were rather striking. In the first case, the statute was held not to apply where the injury was caused by the escape of sparks from a locomotive engine, negligently constructed or maintained, on the Intercolonial Railway. The second case concerned injury to the property of the suppliant resulting from blasting operations carried on, by the Crown in clearing the site of a public work. It must have been a little difficult to understand why the Crown should be responsible for the negligence of its train hands in failing to ring a bell, on approaching a highway, and not responsible for damages caused by the escape of sparks due to the employment of inadequate appliances for the prevention of such escape; and, perhaps, more difficult to understand why, where the safety of people was endangered by the negligent manner in which blasting operations were conducted, one person, who happened to be on a public work, should be entitled to recover damages for injuries due to such negligence, while another person, who was in the vicinity, but not on the public work, should have no remedy. I have no doubt that these decisions explain the introduction of the amendment of 1917,\nIt should, perhaps, be observed that in many cases in the Exchequer Court the ratio of Paul v. The King[43], as expresed in the passage from the judgment of Davies J., above quoted, has been applied. Among them may be mentioned Piggot v. The King[44], supra, decided in 1915; Theberge v. The King[45], decided in 1916; Coleman v. The King[46], decided in 1918; and Desmarais v. The King[47], decided in 1918.\nWe now come to the effect of the statute of 1917. In substance, it is contended on behalf of the respondents, first, that the automobile by which the deceased Albert Dubois, Jr., was killed was a \u201cpublic work\u201d within the meaning of section 19 (c) of the Exchequer Court Act (R.S.C. 1927, ch. 34); and, second, if the automobile itself was not a \u201cpublic work,\u201d then the driver of the automobile, whose negligence unfortunately resulted in the death of the suppliants\u2019 son, was engaged in a public service, the nature of which it is not necessary to enter upon; and, consequently, was within the meaning of the statute \u201cacting within the scope of his duties or employment\u201d upon a \u201cpublic work\u201d when guilty of that negligence.\nThe amendment with which we have to deal was an amendment introduced into the Exchequer Court Act, an amendment effected, as already observed, by a change in the order of the words in one paragraph of section 16 of that Act. The term \u201cpublic work\u201d was already there in paragraph (b). It was already there and remained there in the amended paragraph (c). The scope of the phrase in section 16, as ascertained by reference to the legislation in which those provisions took their origin and the definitions in that legislation, and as determined by the decisions of this court, was plainly settled. No expansion of the meaning of the term \u201cpublic work,\u201d so determined, was necessary to give full effect to the amendment. There is nothing in the amendment requiring any alteration in the sense of the term as settled. The amendment, so to speak, was an amendment within the framework of the existing statute; which framework is not altered by it. \u201cPublic work\u201d still, in paragraph (c), as well as in paragraph (b), designates a physical thing, and not a public service. Indeed, I find it impossible to suppose that anybody drafting an amendment to paragraph (c), by which he proposed to make the Crown liable for the death or injury resulting from the negligence of any officer or servant of the Crown acting within the scope of his duty or employment in the public service, would have retained the phrase \u201cpublic work.\u201d Either the term public service, or public employment, or public labour, or public business, or public duty, would have been made use of, or the phrase \u201cupon any public work\u201d would have been dispensed with altogether; because it is quite clear that the contention that \u201cpublic work\u201d, in the amended statute, is equivalent to public service leads to the conclusion that the phrase \u201cupon any public work\u201d is merely redundant, if not tautological.\nMoreover, if you substitute \u201cpublic service\u201d for \u201cpublic work,\u201d or \u201cpublic employment\u201d or \u201cpublic labour\u201d for \u201cpublic work,\u201d you establish a liability on the part of the Crown generally for the negligence of its servants. It is not a liability for every tort, but it is a liability embracing the vast majority of torts committed by public employees. Maritime torts committed by His Majesty\u2019s vessels, for example, would, speaking generally, fall within it. Such a construction, in a word, adopts the doctrine of respondeat superior generally throughout the whole field of negligence.\nI have nothing to say upon the point whether such an amendment of the law would be desirable. I am not concerned with that. That is for the legislature, not for me. But it would effect a great enlargement of the field of responsibility of the Crown for tort, and the courts can only accept a proposed construction of a statutory enactment accomplishing such a result, where the language is reasonably clear. To me it is not at all doubtful that the language of the statute of 1917 would have been very different if such had been the object of it.\nThere have been some decisions of this court since the enactment of the amendment of 1917. The first to which I must refer is Wolfe v. The King[48]. The precise question before the court in that case was whether or not the Crown was responsible, under the amendment of 1917, for damages caused by a fire which originated in the basement and first floor of a building leased by the Government of Canada under a lease terminable on fourteen days\u2019 notice, as a recruiting station, in 1916-17. In the Exchequer Court it was held that the portion of the building occupied by the Government was not a public work within the meaning of paragraph (c). The Chief Justice adopted that view[49]. Mr. Justice Anglin held that the term \u201cpublic Work\u201d in subsection (c) must be largely governed by the construction given to it in subsection (b), and that \u201cpublic work\u201d in subsection (b) comprehends only \u201cphysical works which are the subject of construction.\u201d Nevertheless, he adhered to the opinion, already referred to, which he had expressed in La Compagnie Generale D\u2019Entreprises Publiques v. The King[50], as to the effect of paragraph (c), prior to the amendment of 1917.\nIt may be noted here that Anglin J. did not suggest and, as I think, plainly enough, did not hold the view, that \u201cpublic work\u201d under the amended statute had any broader signification than it had prior to this amendment.\nIt ought, perhaps, to be noticed here that Mr. Justice Anglin, apparently, in his judgment in La Compagnie Generale D\u2019Entreprises Publiques v. The King[51], where he was dealing with the construction of the phrase \u201cpublic work\u201d as found in the parent enactment, that is to say, prior to the amendment of 1917, seems to have overlooked the circumstance that the rule of construction deducible from the reasons of Davies J. in Paul v. The King51, as applied to the facts of that case, was more than an expression of that learned judge\u2019s individual opinion. It was, as we have seen, the basis of the decision of the majority of the court. The ratio of that decision, which was that \u201cpublic work\u201d ought not to be construed in such a way as to include within its scope public services, as such, but only physical things having a defined area and an ascertained locality, was, of course, binding upon him as well as upon all the members of the court.\nMr. Justice Mignault thought (p. 154) that \u201cpublic work\u201d in paragraph (c) should receive, if possible, the same construction as in paragraph (b); that the public work contemplated by paragraph (b) is a public work coming within the definition of \u201cpublic work\u201d and \u201cpublic works\u201d in the Expropriation Act; and that \u201cit would, at all events, be impossible to give a wider meaning to these words\u201d (any public work) \u201cin subsection (c) than in subsection (b).\u201d He held that the property in question occupied by the Crown was not a public work within the meaning of paragraph (c). It must be observed that here Mr. Justice Mignault gives no countenance to a construction of the phrase \u201cpublic work\u201d under the amended Act which would ascribe to it a broader scope than that which had been attributed to it by the decisions of this court prior to the amendment. Indeed, he expressly holds that its scope is limited by the definition in the Expropriation Act; that such scope cannot be broader than that of the same words in paragraph (b), where they admittedly include only physical things, not services, and could, of course, not be applied to such a thing as a vessel or vehicle.\nI should, perhaps, call attention to an error in the headnote in Wolfe v. The King[52]. That note ascribes to Mr. Justice Mignault, as well as to Mr. Justice Anglin, the view that \u201cpublic work,\u201d in section 20 (c) of the Act of 1917, \u201cincludes any operation undertaken by or on behalf of the Crown in constructing, repairing or maintaining public property.\u201d It is implied in what I have just said, and a perusal of the judgment of Mr. Justice Mignault establishes it, that Mr. Justice Mignault did not give his adherence to that view, but, on the contrary, was of the opinion that by reason of the context, \u201cpublic work\u201d in paragraph (c) must be read as limited by the definition of \u201cpublic work\u201d in the Expropriation Act and, consequently, as excluding public services, as such.\nThe next case is The King v. Schrobounst[53]. Before proceeding with the discussion of that case, it is convenient to give what I believe to be the proper construction of the statute as amended. My own view, as already intimated, is that the principal object of the amendment of 1917 was to bring within the scope of the statute those cases such as Piggott v. The King[54] and Chamberlin v. The King[55], in which an injury not occurring on a public work was caused by the negligence of some servant of the Crown upon a public work; injuries, for example, caused by the escape of sparks from a carelessly constructed locomotive engine, by blasting operations carelessly conducted, and cases in which, through the negligent working of a canal, lands at some distance from the canal are flooded. My view has always been that where you have a public work, in the sense indicated in the course of the preceding discussion, and an injury is caused through the negligence of some servant of the Crown in the execution of his duties or employment in the construction, the repair, the care, the maintenance, the working of such public work, you are not deforming the language of the section, as amended in 1917, by holding that such an injury comes within the scope of the statute; that is to say, that it is an injury due to the negligence of an employee of the Crown while acting in the scope of his duties or employment \u201cupon a public work.\u201d I have always thought, moreover, that the principle ought not to be applied in a niggardly way and that it ought to extend to the negligent acts of public servants necessarily or reasonably incidental to the construction, repair, maintenance, care, working of public works.\nMy reason for this view I can state in a sentence or two. The purpose of the legislation having been, as I have said, to correct the \u201cstupid\u201d inequalities, to use the phrase of Mr. Justice Idington, arising in the application of the statute as it stood before 1917, it seemed to me that that purpose would be largely frustrated if you read the word \u201cupon,\u201d which had been substituted for the word \u201con,\u201d strictly as a preposition of place. In a very large number of cases the officer of the Crown responsible for the injury would be a person whose duties were not carried out on the public work in the physical sense. These considerations have seemd to me to be sufficient to justify the construction I have indicated.\nComing now to Schrobounst\u2019s case[56]. In that case we had to consider a claim arising from the injury to a suppliant who had been run down by a motor vehicle driven by a servant of the Crown who was engaged in transporting to Thorold workmen employed on the Welland Canal there. The question at issue arose on demurrer, and I thought it involved no undue distortion of the language of the statute, as amended, to hold that an allegation that the driver was employed upon the Welland Canal was not, in the circumstances, a demurrable allegation. Further investigation of the circumstances might have disclosed that the employees who were being carried entered upon their duties in entering the motor vehicle. It is possible that Schrobounst\u2019s case[57] has carried the construction of section 19 (c) to the furthest permissible limit, but the principle on which it is based is clearly capable, in my opinion, of justification upon the grounds I have indicated.\nThe next decision was that in The King v. Mason[58]. There, Government employees were engaged in dredging a part of a harbour adjoining a public pier for the purpose of effecting an excavation by which the harbour would be deepened and the navigation of it facilitated. They were engaged, in other words, in effecting a navigation improvement. The plans in evidence show that the excavation was to be of defined area and dimensions. It was, therefore, a public work within the meaning of the definition of \u201cpublic work\u201d contained in the Expropriation Act and in the Official Arbitrators Act. The injury was caused, it was held, by the negligent navigation of a tug which was towing away a scow laden with material taken up by the dredge. The operation in which the officer in charge of the tug was engaged was an operation necessarily incidental to the deepening of the harbour, to the creation, that is to say, of the harbour improvement. He was, therefore, on the principle indicated, employed upon the harbour improvement.\nIt is important, in applying legislation of this character, to be on one\u2019s guard against a very natural tendency. For the reasons I have given, the conclusion is inescapable that the purpose of the statute is not to establish the doctrine respondeat superior as affecting the Crown throughout the whole field of negligence. The area of responsibility, even in respect of negligence, is restricted. In Schrobounst\u2019s case57 this court thought it was not infringing upon this restriction in holding that the facts of that case brought it within the statute. There is a natural tendency to take the latest case as a new starting point and to apply the statute to all cases which seem to fall within any of its apparent logical implications. But one thing is indisputable. If the supposed logical implication carries you beyond the area delimitated by the language of the statute, then you cannot give effect to it without transcending your function as a judge. You are constituting yourself a legislator; and you cannot, for the purpose of this case, having regard to the history of the legislation and the decisions upon it, which are binding on this court, hold that \u201cpublic work,\u201d in this enactment, includes matters which are not physical things, but public service or public employment as such.\nWhat I have said in relation to public service and public employment applies, in large degree, mutatis mutandis, to such things as vessels and vehicles.\nThe decisions of this court upon the statute as it stood prior to the amendment of 1917 (section 16 (c) of the statute of 1887) exclude, as appears above, the possibility of reading the words \u201cpublic work,\u201d in the last mentioned statute, as including within their scope vehicles or vessels. Mr. Justice Burbidge, it is true, while rejecting the suggestion that vehicles or vessels generally fall within the scope of the phrase, did suggest, in Paul v. The King[59], that a dredge engaged in deepening one of the channels of the St. Lawrence river might be a public work or \u201con a public work\u201d; but this suggestion was, as we have seen, definitely rejected by the Supreme Court of Canada on appeal from Mr. Justice Burbidge in that case[60]; and, as already pointed out, vehicles and vessels are not within the definition in the Official Arbitrators Act or the Expropriation Act. Of course, if a construction had been adopted by which \u201cpublic work,\u201d in the phrase \u201con a public work\u201d in the statute of 1887, was held to signify public service or public employment, then the statute might have been applied to injuries caused by the negligence of a servant of the Crown driving a vehicle within the scope of his duties as such. But this view of the statute was rejected and the phrase \u201con a public work\u201d was read as indicative of the locality in which the injury must occur in order to bring the case within the statute; and necessarily, as already explained, in view of the fact that the jurisdiction under the Act of 1887 was a jurisdiction transferred from the Official Arbitrators Act where the language, so far as pertinent to the present point, was identical with that employed in the statute of 1887; and in view of the definition of \u201cpublic work\u201d in the Official Arbitrators Act, and the scope and signification which, by force of that definition, had become attached to the words \u201cpublic work.\u201d\nHaving regard to all this, I find it very difficult to convince myself that anybody intending to subject the Crown to liability for negligence of its servants engaged in driving vehicles belonging to the Crown, or in navigating a vessel belonging to the Crown, could employ the procedure followed in effecting the amendment of 1917. If such had been the purpose of that amendment a different procedure would most assuredly have been resorted to.\nI should add that if \u201cpublic work\u201d embraces employment and service as well as physical things, then the reference in Schrobounst\u2019s case[61] to the \u201cpublic work\u201d at Thorold was entirely superfluous; because the driver of the motor vehicle was admittedly, \u201cacting within the scope of his duties or employment\u201d upon a public service\u2014that of driving the vehicle. On the construction now contended for, that, in itself, was sufficient to establish liability.\nI have not thought it necessary to discuss the wealth of material put before us by Mr. Morse in his most able and interesting argument: because decisions in other jurisdictions upon other statutes, not in pari materia, interesting as they may be, cannot safely be relied upon as a guide, especially when, in the decisions of this Court, and in the history of the legislation under review, we have a very sufficient lexicon for the purpose in hand.\nI now turn to the consideration of a point not mentioned on the argument which has been brought before us as the result of the research of our brother Cannon.\nThe respondents\u2019 claim rests upon section 19 of the Exchequer Court Act (R.S.C. 1927, ch. 34). In the French version the enactment upon which the respondents rely reads as follows:\n19. La cour de l\u2019Echiquier a aussi juridiction exclusive en premi\u00e8re-instance pour entendre et juger les mati\u00e8res suivantes:\n* * *\n(c) Toute r\u00e9clamation contre la Couronne provenant de la mort de quelqu\u2019un ou de blessures \u00e0 la personne ou de dommages \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, r\u00e9sultant de la n\u00e9gligence de tout employ\u00e9 ou serviteur de la Couronne-pendant qu\u2019il agissait dans l\u2019exercice de ses fonctions ou de son emploi dans tout chantier public;\n* * * Before calling attention to the effect of this language, it is right to mention, first of all, that the statutes of the Parliament of Canada in their French version pass through the two Houses of Parliament and receive the assent of His Majesty at the same time and according to the same procedure as those statutes in their English version. The enactment quoted is an enactment of the Parliament of Canada just as the enactments of the same section, expressed in English, are.\nThe first section of the Act respecting the Revised Statutes of Canada, assented to on the 19th of July, 1924, is in these words:\n1. So soon as the said Commissioners or a majority of them shall report in writing the completion of the said consolidation, including therein such Acts or parts of Acts passed during the present session and subsequent thereto as the Governor General upon the said report may deem advisable so to be included, the Governor General may cause a printed Roll thereof, attested under his signature and that of the Clerk of the Parliaments to be deposited in the office of such Clerk; and such Roll shall be held to be the original of the said statutes so revised, classified and consolidated.\nSections 4, 5 and 8 are as follows:,\n4. The Governor in Council, after such deposit of the said last mentioned Roll, may, by proclamation, declare the day on, from and after which the same shall come into force and have effect as law, by the designation of \u201cThe Revised Statutes of Canada, 192...\u201d\n5. On, from and after such day, the said Roll shall accordingly come into force and effect as and by the designation of \u201cThe Revised Statutes of Canada, 192...,\u201d to all intents, as if the same were expressly embodied in and enacted by this Act, to come into force and have effect, on from and after such day.\n2. On, from and after such day, all the enactments in the several Acts and parts of Acts in Schedule A above mentioned shall stand and be repealed to the extent mentioned in the third column of the said Schedule A.\n* * *\n8. The said Revised Statutes shall not be held to operate as new laws, but shall be construed and have effect as a consolidation and as declaratory of the law as contained in the said Acts and parts of Acts so repealed, and for which the said Revised Statutes are substituted.\n2. If upon any point the provisions of the said Revised Statutes are not in effect the same as those of the repealed Acts and parts of Acts for which they are substituted, then as respects all transactions, matters and things subsequent to the time when the said Revised Statutes take effect, the provisions contained in them shall prevail; but, as respects all transactions, matters and things anterior to the said time, the provisions of the said repealed Acts and parts of Acts shall prevail.\nThe proclamation contemplated by this Act was made on the 22nd of December, 1927. It is quite clear that, as regards the alleged negligence, in respect of which the respondents\u2019 claim arises, which occurred after the Revised Statutes received the force of law, the respondents\u2019 remedy, if any, must be derived from the Revised Statutes. It seems equally clear that, in construing section 19 of the Exchequer Court Act, the statute in its French version cannot be ignored.\nThe phrase \u201cpendant qu\u2019il agissait dans l\u2019exercice de ses fonctions ou de son emploi dans tout chantier public\u201d is plainly inconsistent with any construction of the phrase \u201cpublic work\u201d which has the effect of extending its meaning in such a way as to include public services. The rule for the construction of the parent enactment (50-51 Vict., c. 16, s. 16 (c)), laid down in Paul v. The King[62], that the phrase \u201cpublic work\u201d includes physical things of defined area and ascertained locality and does not include public services, is plainly sanctioned and adopted by these words as the rule applicable to the construction of section 19 in the Revised Statutes of 1927.\n\u201cChantier,\u201d in this connection, implies defined area and locality and is incapable of application in such a way as to include public services, as such. We are indebted to our brother Cannon for the following note upon the subject which puts this point beyond dispute:\nLittr\u00e9, \u201cDictionnaire de la langue fran\u00e7aise,\u201d verbo \u201cchantier\u201d nous dit que d\u2019apr\u00e8s le sens donn\u00e9 soit par le bas latin, soit par le fran\u00e7ais, le chantier est une place, un espace vide o\u00f9 l\u2019on entasse du bois, o\u00f9 l\u2019on radoube un vaisseau, o\u00f9 l\u2019on travaille quoi que ce soit.\nLarousse du XX\u00e8me si\u00e8cle le d\u00e9finit: Atelier \u00e0 l\u2019air libre, cl\u00f4tur\u00e9 ou non, o\u00f9 l\u2019on travaille des mat\u00e9riaux de construction (bois, pierre, fer, etc.).\nHarzfeld, Darmesteter & Thomas, \u201cDictionnaire de la langue fran\u00e7aise\u201d; Lieu o\u00f9 l\u2019on d\u00e9pose des mat\u00e9riaux pour les travailler.\nLafaye, \u201cDictionnaire des synonymes de la langue fran\u00e7aise,\u201d sous la rubrique: \u201cboutique, magasin, atelier, chantier, le d\u00e9finit: Tout lieu consacr\u00e9 \u00e0 une industrie.

Ce qu\u2019on y tient en d\u00e9p\u00f4t ou en vente, c\u2019est exclusivement du bois, bois de chauffage, de charpente, de charronnage, de construction, et quelquefois des pierres \u00e0 b\u00e2tir; d\u2019autre part, le bois et la pierre sont les seules mati\u00e8res employ\u00e9es dans les travaux du chantier tous ou la plupart relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019industrie du b\u00e2timent, et qui comprennent principalement ceux des charpentiers, des scieurs de long, des constructeurs de navires et des tailleurs de pierre.\nLebrun & Toisoul, \u201cDictionnaire Etymologique de la langue fran\u00e7aise:\nChantier: Atelier \u00e0 l\u2019air libre, cl\u00f4tur\u00e9 ou couvert, o\u00f9 l\u2019on travaille le bois, la pierre. Sachet, \u201cAccidents du travail, 1er vol. p. 85, n\u00b0 82, nous dit:\n\u201cLe chantier est en principe, \u00e0 l\u2019industrie du b\u00e2timent et de la construction ce que l\u2019usine, la manufacture ou la fabrique sont \u00e0 l\u2019industrie de la production: pris dans son acception premi\u00e8re il signifie l\u2019emplacement o\u00f9 des ouvriers sont occup\u00e9s \u00e0 travailler le bois, la pierre, la terre et les diff\u00e9rents mat\u00e9riaux destin\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9dification de b\u00e2timents ou \u00e0 la construction de routes, chemins, chauss\u00e9es, travaux d\u2019art, etc. Mais peu \u00e0 peu le sens de cette expression s\u2019est \u00e9largie et a fini par englober, du moins dans le langage courant, tous les lieux de travail un peu vastes, ainsi que les d\u00e9p\u00f4ts de marchandises des n\u00e9gociants en gros, quelle que soit la nature des travaux qui y sont ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s.\u201d\nLa Revue Trimestrielle de Droit Civil, 1902, 1er vol., \u00e9tudiant la loi sur la responsabilit\u00e9 des accidents du travail, donne, \u00e0 la page 456, les indications suivantes:\n\u201c37. Chantiers\u2014Dans quel sens le l\u00e9gislateur de 1808 a-t-il entendu employer le mot \u201cchantier\u201d?\nPour M. Cabouat c\u2019est un terme vague sans acception pr\u00e9cise. Pour M. Loubat c\u2019est un lieu en plein air o\u00f9 on dispose les objets pour les travailler\u2019 (Loubat, op. cit., p. 91, n\u00b0 100). Avec M. Sachet au contraire nous nous trouvons en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019une d\u00e9finition pr\u00e9cise et restrictive: \u2018C\u2019est un emplacement o\u00f9 des ouvriers sont occup\u00e9s \u00e0 travailler le bois, la pierre, la terre et les diff\u00e9rents mat\u00e9riaux destin\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9dification de b\u00e2timents ou \u00e0 la construction de routes\u2019 (Sachet, op. cit., p. 84, n\u00b0 10).\nCette d\u00e9finition est rejet\u00e9e par la Cour de Caen, qui d\u00e9cide que \u2018l\u2019expression chantier de l\u2019article 1er de la loi de 1898 implique le groupement, dans un emplacement d\u00e9termin\u00e9, d\u2019un certain nombre d\u2019ouvriers employ\u00e9s \u00e0 la pr\u00e9paration des mat\u00e9riaux destin\u00e9s \u00e0 des constructions ou \u00e0 des travaux quelconques\u2019 (C. Caen, 30 janv. 1901, Rec. Arr. Caen, 1901, p. 5).\nThe statute, in the French version, plainly does not envisage a vessel, as such, although it does envisage a shipyard. Nor does it contemplate an automobile as such, although it may very well be held to contemplate an automobile factory.\nThe statute, in the French version, must, of course, be read with the statute in the English version. I am not suggesting that, read in that way, the proper construction and application of the statute is inconsistent with the construction and application of it in the actual decision in Schrobounst\u2019s case[63] or in Mason\u2019s case[64], supra; but, the phraseology of the French version markedly emphasizes what I have already indicated, that is to say, the impropriety of making these two decisions a new point of departure for the development of a principle of liability which the statute plainly does not sanction.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the petition dismissed. We assume the Crown will not ask for costs. RINFRET J.\u2014The appeal should be allowed and the petition dismissed. In my opinion this is not a case for costs.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W. Stuart Edwards.\nSolicitor for the respondents: Paul Labette.\n[1] [1934] Ex.

(Rinfret J., through illness, did not take part in the judgment).\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nCrown\u2014Liability of, for negligence of its servant \u201cwhile acting within the scope of his duties or employment upon any public work\u201d (Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 34, s. 19 (c))\u2014Collision through negligent driving of Crown\u2019s motor truck by soldier in Canadian Army Service Corps on returning from delivering military stores to Airport of Royal Air Force.\nThe suppliants claimed damages from the Crown by reason of the death of M., who was fatally injured when a motor truck in which he was riding collided with a motor truck of the Crown, driven (negligently, as found at trial) by K, a private in the Canadian Army Service Corps. K\u2019s duties were those \u201cof driver of a mechanical transport vehicle,\u201d and he had driven the truck from its garage (which, served as a depot for such vehicles) at Kingston, with -military stores which were (being sent by the Canadian Army Service at Kingston to a detachment of the Royal Air Force airport at Trenton. The stores had been delivered and the truck was returning to Kingston when the accident happened.\nHeld: The negligence of K. was not \u201cnegligence of any officer or servant of the Crown while acting within the scope of his duties or employment upon any public work\u201d within s. 19 (c) of the Exchequer Court Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 34), so as to make the Crown liable. While the airport at Trenton, as well as the garage at Kingston, might well fall within the description \u201cpublic work\u201d (The King v. Dubois, ante, p. 378). and while the duties of the officer or servant, in the execution of which the negligence occurs, may be so connected with the public work (in or in relation to the construction, repair, maintenance, working or care of it) as to bring negligence in their performance, elsewhere than on the public work, within the scope of the enactment (The King v. Dubois supra), there was in the present case no such connection between the duties or employment in which K. was engaged at the time of the collision, and either the garage at Kingston or the Trenton airport, as to bring his negligence within the scope of the words quoted. \u201cPublic work\u201d in the enactment cannot be read as the equivalent of public service (The King v. Dubois, supra).\nJudgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada, [1934] Ex. C.R. 188, reversed.\nAPPEAL by the Crown from the judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], in favour of the suppliants, who, by petition of right, had claimed damages from the Crown for the death of one Himan Moscovitz, who died from injuries received in a collision of motor trucks. The suppliant Rose Muscovitz was the widow of the deceased and was executrix of his estate. The suppliant Anna Moscovitz was step-mother of the deceased.\nThe deceased\u2019s death ensued from a collision between a motor truck in which he was a passenger, and a motor truck, the property of the Crown, driven on the occasion in question by Private Kelly, a soldier in a detachment of the Canadian Army Service Corps, stationed just outside the city of Kingston, Ont. Kelly\u2019s duties were those \u201cof driver of a mechanical transport vehicle.\u201d The truck he was driving on the occasion in question was, when not in use, ordinarily stored in a garage at Kingston, which garage was owned or rented by the Crown and was occupied by the Royal Canadian Army Service Corps, and served as a depot for mechanical transport vehicles.\nThe truck, driven by Kelly, had been carrying certain military stores, sent by the Canadian Army Service at Kingston to a detachment of the Royal Air Force airport at Trenton, Ont. The stores had been delivered at Trenton, and the truck was on its return to Kingston, when the collision occurred. The trial judge found that the accident was owing to the negligent driving of Kelly.\nThe trial judge held that on the occasion in question Kelly was engaged upon a public work (within the meaning of the Exchequer Court Act), the transporting of military stores belonging to the Crown, from one point to another, from one public service to another, by a motor truck belonging to the Crown; also that Kelly was acting within the scope of his duties as a servant of the Crown at the time of the accident; and that the Crown was liable in damages to the suppliants. By the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada, now reported, the appeal was allowed and the petition of right dismissed.\nF. P. Varcpe K.C. and C. A. Payne K.C. for the appellant.\nB. C. Donnan, K.C. and N. Borins for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Duff C.J. and Cannon, Crocket and Hughes JJ. (Rinfret J., through illness, not taking part in the judgment) was delivered by\nDuff C.J.\u2014The learned President of the Exchequer Court has held that the Crown is responsible under section 19 (c) of the Exchequer Court Act (R.S.C. 1927, ch. 34) for the consequences of the negligence of Private Kelly in driving a motor truck, the property of the Crown, in the exercise of his functions as a private in the Canadian Army Service Corps. This negligence, it has been found, was the cause of the death of the deceased Himan Moscovitz in respect of which his widow and his stepmother, the respondents, claim compensation under Lord Campbell\u2019s- Act.\nThe learned President says:\nI am of the opinion that on the occasion in question Kelly was engaged upon a public work, the transporting of military stores belonging to the Crown from one point to another, from one public service to another, by a motor truck belonging to the Crown. I am of the opinion also that Kelly was acting within the scope of his duties as a servant of the Crown at the time of the accident.\nKelly\u2019s duties were those \u201cof driver of a mechanical, transport vehicle.\u201d In pursuance of those duties, on the 8th of November, 1932, he drove a truck from the garage at Kingston to the airport at Trenton for the delivery there of military supplies for the use of the \u201cpersonnel of the airport.\u201d Kelly was not in any way attached to the airport, had no connection with the Air Force, and was not subject to the orders or instructions of any Air officer at the airport.\nThe stores in the truck were in charge of Private Batty who had been detailed for that purpose. Batty\u2019s truck was accompanied by another engaged on the same service in charge of Corporal Cherry. After unloading at Trenton, the trucks did not return to Kingston direct but proceeded to Belleville, where, as he explained, Corporal Cherry \u201chad business.\u201d At Belleville they stopped for an hour and a half or two hours, leaving, about seven o\u2019clock in the evening, on their return to Kingston. It was on this stage of their journey that the collision occurred in which the deceased Himan Moscovitz unhappily lost his life. The question of substance on the appeal is whether or not the negligence of Kelly, in the language of section 19 (c), is\nnegligence of any officer or servant of the Crown while acting within the scope of his duties or employment upon any public work\nor, in the French version,\nnegligence de tout employ\u00e9 ou serviteur de la Couronne pendant qu\u2019il agissait dans l\u2019exercice de ses fonctions ou de son emploi dans tout chantier public.\nIt will be clear, from what has been said in the judgment in The King v. Dubois[2], that the airport at Trenton, as well as the garage at Kingston, may well fall within the description \u201cpublic work\u201d or \u201cchantier public,\u201d in the meaning of this enactment.\nThe precise point for determination is whether or not Kelly, in driving a truck belonging to the Army Service Corps, was in the sense of the enactment \u201cacting within the scope of his duties or employment upon\u201d such \u201cpublic work\u201d; or \u201cdans\u201d the \u201cchantier public\u201d in question.\nThe phrases \u201cpublic work\u201d and \u201cchantier public\u201d contemplate, as has been fully explained in Dubois\u2019 case2, not public services, but physical things. Nevertheless, the phrase \u201cupon any public work,\u201d \u201cdans tout chantier public,\u201d has received a liberal construction in the decisions of this court in The King v. Schrobounst[3] and The King v. Mason[4]. It is not essential that the act of negligence should be committed by the negligent officer or servant during his presence on the public work. The duties of the officer or servant, in the execution of which the negligence occurs, may be so connected with the public work (in or in relation to the construction, repair, maintenance, working or care of it) as to bring negligence in their performance elsewhere within the scope of the statute. The ground upon which such a construction may be supported has been explained in the judgment in Dubois\u2019 case2.\nI cannot find here any such connection between the duties or employment in which Kelly was engaged at the time of the collision, and either the garage at Kingston which served as a depot for mechanical transport vehicles, or the Trenton airport, as to bring Kelly\u2019s negligence within the scope of the words quoted. Kelly was, in truth, simply the driver of an automobile the property of the Crown under the control of the Army Service Corps; an automobile used generally, it may be assumed, for the purposes of military transport. If you interpret \u201cpublic work,\u201d \u201cchantier public,\u201d as the learned President has done, as embracing a public service of that kind, then the case, of course, falls within the statute. I have given my reasons in the Dubois case (1) for the conclusion that the phrase cannot receive such an extended interpretation. Such a public service is not, as explained in that judgment, for the purpose in hand, differentiated by any substantial distinction from any other public service; and to read \u201cpublic work,\u201d \u201cchantier public,\u201d as the equivalent of public service, is, for the reasons there given, plainly inadmissible.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed. I assume the Crown will not ask for costs.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Chas. A. Payne.\nSolicitor for the respondents: B. C. Donnan.\n[1] [1934] Ex.

Heninger (Plaintiff) Respondent\n1935: May 22; 1935: June 10.\nPresent:\u2014Duff C.J. and Cannon, Crocket and Davis JJ. and Dysart J. ad hoc.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA\nLandlord and tenant\u2014Distress Act, section 5\u2014Right of distress as against chattel mortgage from \"the tenant\"\u2014Mortgage given while mortgagor was not tenant of distraining landlord\u2014The Distress Act, R.SA., 1922, c. 97, s. 5. One Beatrice A. Raby, some years prior to becoming the tenant of the appellants, had given the respondent a chattel mortgage on her household goods and furniture. During the tenancy, the appellants made a distress for overdue rent and seized the goods found on the premises. The respondent claimed the goods under the chattel mortgage and asserted that they were exempt from the appellants' distress for rent. An interpleader issue between the parties was directed to be tried. Section 5 of the Alberta Distress Act, R.S.A., which restricts a landlord's right of distress to the goods of the tenant contains the proviso that the \"restriction shall not apply * * * in favour of any person whose title is derived by purchase, * * * assignment from the tenant whether * * * by way of mortgage or otherwise\" * * * * The trial judge, Lunney, J., held in favour of the appellants (landlords); the Appellate Division (Clarke, J. dissenting) took the opposite view, and accordingly gave judgment in favour of the respondent (chattel mortgagee). The Appellate Division gave special leave to the appellants to appeal to this Court. Held, reversing the judgment of the Appellate Division ([1934] 3 W.W.R. 332), that the goods and chattels covered by the mortgage were subject to the appellants' distress for rent.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], reversing the judgment of the trial judge, Lunney J., and maintaining the respondent's action.\nThe appellants, having rented certain premises to one Beatrice A. Raby, made a distress for $365 overdue rent and seized certain chattels on the premises. The respondent claimed these chattels under a chattel mortgage for $1,500 made to him by Beatrice A. Raby before the tenancy commenced. An interpleader issue between the parties was directed to determine whether at the time of the seizure under the distress warrant the chattels distrained were the property of the respondent or of the landlords.\nO. M. Biggar K.C. for the appellants.\nJ. A. Ritchie K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nDAVIS J.\u2014This appeal raises a very narrow, though rather difficult, point. Beatrice A. Raby, some years prior to becoming the tenant of the appellants, had given the respondent a chattel mortgage on her household goods and furniture. During the tenancy, the appellants made a distress for overdue rent and seized the goods found on the premises. The respondent claimed the goods under the chattel mortgage and asserted that they were exempt from the appellants' distress for rent. An interpleader issue between the parties was directed to be tried. The parties reside and the premises are situate in the city of Lethbridge, Alta.\nSection 5 of the Alberta Distress Act, R.S.A., ch. 97, is as follows: 5. A landlord shall not distrain for rent on the goods and chattels the property of any person except the tenant or person who is liable for the rent although the same are found on the premises; but this restriction shall not apply in favour of a person claiming title under or by virtue of an execution against the tenant or in favour of any person whose title is derived by purchase, gift, transfer or assignment from the tenant whether absolute or in trust or by way of mortgage or otherwise nor to the interest of the tenant in any goods on the premises in the possession of the tenant under a contract for purchase or by which he may or is to become the owner thereof upon performance of any condition nor where goods have been exchanged between two tenants or persons by the one borrowing or hiring from the other for the purpose of defeating the claim of or the right of distress by the landlord nor shall the restriction apply where the property is claimed by the wife, husband, daughter, son, daughter-in-law, or son-in-law of the tenant or by any other relative of his in case such other relative lives on the premises as a member of the tenant's family.\nThe respondent's chattel mortgage having come into existence before Beatrice A. Raby became the tenant of the appellants, the sole question for decision is whether or not the goods and chattels covered by the mortgage were subject to the appellants' distress for rent. At common law, goods were liable to be distrained for rent in respect of their locality, that is by reason of their being on the demised premises, and not in respect of their ownership; and the goods of a stranger to the tenancy might be distrained on as well as the tenant's own goods. But the English law became so altered by the Law of Distress Amendment Act, 1908, that it may be said that the goods of any other person than the tenant cannot now be distrained on unless they are exempt from the protection given by that Act or otherwise by law. The Alberta statute provides that a landlord shall not distrain for rent on the goods and chattels the property of any person except the tenant or person who is liable for the rent although the same are found on the premises, but certain exceptions are made to this general restriction. One of these exceptions is that the restriction shall not apply\nin favour of any person whose title is derived by purchase, gift, transfer or assignment from the tenant whether absolute or in trust or by way of mortgage or otherwise.\nThe point in issue is whether in order to come within this exception the mortgage must have been made while the mortgagor was the tenant of the landlord or whether the exception applies irrespective of the time of the making of the mortgage. The exception is \"of any person whose title is derived * * * from the tenant * * *.\" Is it necessary that the mortgage be made during the term of the tenancy?\nLunney, J., of the Supreme Court of Alberta, on the trial of the issue held in favour of the appellants (landlords). Upon appeal, the Appellate Division of that Court[2] (Clarke, J. dissenting), took the opposite view and accordingly gave judgment in favour of the respondent (chattel mortgagee). The Appellate Division gave special leave to the appellants to appeal to this Court.\nThe English statute, the Law of Distress Amendment Act, 1908, 8 Edw. VII, c. 53, s. 4, provides that the Act shall not apply\nto goods comprised in any bill of sale, hire-purchase agreement, or settlement made by such tenant.\nThere appears to be no case under the English statute that has raised the point with which we have to deal, but I find in the last edition of Woodfall's Landlord and Tenant (23rd ed., 1934) at p. 581, in discussing the exception in respect of \"goods comprised in any bill of sale\" the following comment in foot-note (o),\nthe exclusion of such goods was intended to prevent the tenant from giving the appearance of a financial position which he does not possess.\nIn my opinion it is too narrow a view of the statute to draw a distinction between a chattel mortgage made before and one made after the commencement of the tenancy. The words of the exception must be considered with relation to the principal matter. The intention of the legislature obviously was to protect the landlord from claims against the goods on the premises that might be made by the different classes of persons enumerated in the section, and to give to the landlord in respect of his rent a priority over such claims. I can find nothing in the language of the section to support the view that the only mortgage in contemplation of the legislature was a mortgage made after the commencement of the tenancy. It would have been easy to have so said if that had been in the mind of the legislature. In Hackney Furnishing Co. v. Watts[3], Bray, J., in considering whether the goods distrained on were comprised in a hire-purchase agreement within the meaning of s. 4 of the Law of Distress Amendment Act, 1908, said, at p. 232: It must be remembered that the statute is one depriving the landlord of a part of his common law right to distrain. The words must not be strained so as to further restrict his rights.\nIt had been held in the Court of Appeal in Rogers, Eungblut and Co. v. Martin(1), that the words \"made by such tenant\" in s. 4 of the Act, refer not only to the word \"settlement,\" which immediately precedes them, but also to the previous words \"bill of sale\" and \"hire-purchase agreement.\"\nI would allow the appeal and determine the issue in favour of the appellants with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\n[1] [1934] 3 W.W.R. 332.\n[2] [1934] 3 W.W.R. 332.\n[3] [1912] 3 K.B. 225.\n",

The appellant understood that his refusal to execute the covenant would lead to an early termination of his employment. About four years later the respondent company terminated the employment by giving the appellant one month\u2019s notice, and soon after his dismissal, the appellant entered service with another drug company which had opened a drug store immediately adjoining the respondent\u2019s store. Alleging breach of covenant, the respondent company brought action on the bond for the penal sum of $5,000, and, at the trial, was allowed to ask for additional relief by way of injunction. The trial judge dismissed the action on the ground that there was no consideration for the bond. The majority of the Court of Appeal held that the bond was sufficiently supported by consideration and was otherwise enforceable.\nHeld that there was in this case legal consideration for the bond; but, reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal ([1934] 2 W.W.R. 298), that, under the circumstances of this case, the bond was unreasonable and unenforceable.\nPer Davis J.\u2014A master is not permitted to impose restraint outside of reasonable limits upon his servant, after discharge, from turning his skill and knowledge to the best account and the respondent company failed to establish facts and circumstances surrounding the employment of the appellant sufficient for the Court to say that the agreement was reasonable.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1], reversing the judgment of the trial judge, Adamson, J.[2] and maintaining respondent\u2019s action by awarding damages in the sum of $2,000 for past breach, and granting an injunction against further breach, of a covenant in restraint of trade as between an employer and an employee.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nO. M. Biggar K.C. and M. B. Gordon for the appellant.\nE. F. Newcombe K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Duff C.J. and Lamont and Cannon JJ. and Dysart J. ad hoc was delivered by\nDysart J. ad hoc\u2014This is an appeal from the Court of Appeal for Manitoba1 pronounced the 14th day of May, 1934, setting aside a judgment of Adamson J.2, and awarding damages in the sum of $2,000 for past breach, and granting an injunction against future breach, of a covenant in restraint of trade as between an employer and an employee.\nThe Northland Drug Company, a partnership, was doing retail drug business at the town of The Pas in Northern Manitoba in January, 1928, and had planned to open up branch stores at Flin Flon and other mining localities in that part of the province. In January, the company engaged the appellant, a pharmaceutical druggist, to enter its employ with the view of taking charge of the Flin Flon store when opened. The hiring was by the month at a monthly salary of $200 and certain living privileges. After a few weeks spent at The Pas, the appellant was placed in charge of the newly-opened Flin Flon store and there continued in the capacity of manager until September, 1932, when he was dismissed on one month\u2019s notice. In the interval, in May, 1928, the said partnership was changed to an incorporated company, and in December of that year, nearly eleven months after the commencement of his employment, the appellant executed the covenant in question.\nThe covenant is in the form of a bond under seal, and is conditioned as follows, that,\nThe said Robt. W. Maguire shall not while in the employment of the said Northland Drug Company, Limited, or its successors in business, whether in his present or any other capacity, or during the period of five years after he shall * * * have ceased to be so employed, directly or indirectly, and whether as principal, agent, director of a company, traveller, servant or otherwise, carry on, or be engaged, or concerned, or take part in the business of retail druggist, or such sundry business as is usual to the retail drug within 25 miles of Flin Flon Mine, except on behalf of or with the consent in writing of the said Northland Drug Company, Limited, or its successor in business.\nThe circumstances in which the bond was executed were as follows: the general manager of the respondent, in one of his frequent visits to the Flin Flon store for the purposes of inspection and overseeing, produced the document which he had had prepared for the occasion, and requested the appellant to sign it, stating that all branch managers of the respondent were required to sign similar bonds. This was the first intimation the appellant had of any such requirement. Nevertheless, he signed without protest or objection. Thereafter he continued in his employment, without change in the tenure thereof or in the scope of duties, until dismissed nearly three years later.\nThe appellant\u2019s duties are not clearly defined in evidence. His work at the store at The Pas was presumably intended as preparatory for his work at the Flin Flon, and we may assume that he was there made acquainted with many of his employer\u2019s business methods and practices. At Flin Flon he is said to have been \u201cin charge of\u201d the store as \u201cmanager,\u201d but the bond recites that he was employed \u201cin the capacity of druggist,\u201d It appears that he gave orders for the purchase of merchandise from time to time, but always subject to the supervision and directions of the respondent\u2019s general manager; and also that he acted as salesman in the store. The scope and nature of the business carried on at the Flin Flon store are variously supposed to include the sundry businesses usual to a retail drug store, adapted to the needs of a frontier mining town.\nSoon after his dismissal, the appellant entered service in another drug store, which then opened at Flin Flon immediately adjoining the respondent\u2019s store, in which employment his duties were quite similar to those which he had performed for the respondent. Alleging breach of covenant, the respondent brought action on the bond for the penal sum of $5,000, and, at the trial, was allowed to ask for additional relief by way of injunction. The learned trial judge[3], feeling that he was bound by the decision of the Manitoba Court of Appeal in the case of Copeland-Chatteton v. Hickok[4], dismissed the action on the ground that there was no consideration for the bond. On appeal, the majority of the learned judges distinguished the Copeland-Chatteton case4 and held that the bond was sufficiently supported by consideration and was otherwise enforceable. Trueman and Robson JJ. dissenting, differed on the point of consideration, but were both of opinion that the covenant was unreasonable and therefore unenforceable.\nThere was ample consideration for the bond. Although the necessity of proving consideration for the covenant is not dispensed with by the presence of a seal in a case of this kind, sufficient appears from the evidence adduced at the trial to establish, that the employee was given to understand, and did understand, that his refusal to execute the covenant would lead to an early termination of his employment, and that the employer tacitly promised that if the bond were signed, the employment would not soon be terminated. On this mutual understanding the covenant was entered into, and thereafter the employer refrained indefinitely from exercising its legal right to issue the notice which, at the expiration of one month, would terminate the employment. This continuance of employment constitutes legal consideration, the adequacy of which will not be inquired into by courts: Gravely v. Barnard[5]; Skeans v. Hampton[6].\nThe decision in this case must turn on the larger question of whether or not this particular covenant is one which ought to be enforced. Public policy, as interpreted by the courts, requires on the one hand that employers be left free to protect from violation their proprietary rights in business, and on the other hand, that every man be left free to use to his advantage his skill and knowledge in trade. In the weighing and balancing of these opposing rights, the whole problem in cases of covenants in restraint of trade is to be found. Less latitude is allowed in the enforcement of restrictions as between employer and employee than as between vendor and purchaser of good will. Prima facie all covenants in restraint of trade are illegal and therefore unenforceable: Morris v. Saxeby[7]. The illegality being a presumption only, is rebuttable by evidence of facts and circumstances showing that the covenant is reasonable, in that it goes no further than is necessary to protect the rights which the employer is entitled to protect, while at the same time it does not unduly restrain the employee from making use of his skill and talents. The onus of rebutting the presumption is on the party who seeks the enforcement, generally the covenantee. Reasonableness is the test to be applied in ascertaining whether or not the covenant is a fair compromise between the two opposing interests.\nThe practical question then is this,5 what are the rights which the employer is entitled to protect by such a covenant, and6 does the covenant not go beyond what is reasonably adequate in furnishing that protection. Proprietary rights, such as secrets of manufacturing process and secret modes of merchandising, clearly come within the group of rights entitled to protection. So also is the right of an employer to preserve secret information regarding his customers, their names, addresses, tastes and desires: Mason v. Provident Clothing Co.[8]. Competition, as such, is something which will not be restrained: Vancouver Malt & Sake Brewing Co. v. Vancouver Breweries Ltd[9] The information and training which an employer imparts to his employee become part of the equipment in skill and knowledge of the employee, and so are beyond the reach of such a covenant; Leng v. Andrews[10]. The covenant in any event must not go further than is reasonably adequate to give the protection that is to be afforded; if it goes too far or is too wide, either as to time or place or scope, it will not be enforced; and if bad in any particular, it is bad altogether; Mason v. Provident Clothing Co.[11].\nViewed in the light of these well-established principles, the case before us disclosed several grave defects and weaknesses. The evidence discloses no special proprietary rights, and we are left to infer from the general nature of the business what general rights were entitled to protection. We are not told that there were any secrets of manufactuing or of buying or selling to be protected; no private knowledge concerning customers, their names, addresses, is revealed. Even if there were any such, the evidence does not show that the employer imparted to the employee in confidence any information concerning any of these matters. There is no hint that the employee has ever abused or misused, or that he has threatened or is likely, to abuse or misuse any such information. In the face of the almost entire lack of evidence on these points, the Court should not supply the deficiencies from the realm of conjecture or supposition.\nThe only evidence offered in support of the claim for relief is that the respondent\u2019s gross sales substantially declined in the months following the employee\u2019s change of employment. The decline, however, had already set in before 1932 and had more than once been called to the attention of the employee; how far, if at all, it had been a factor in bringing about his dismissal is not mentioned. But the decline in sales must have been due in large measure to the general depression in business, and perhaps to the existence of the new competing store,\u2014two factors against neither of which the employer had a right to be protected by this covenant. It is said that some customers transferred their patronage from the old to the new store, and that this is to be counted a violation of the covenant. The customers were free to change their patronage at will, and to show their preference for superior attractions in a rival store, or for the personality and efficiency of the salesmen thereof. So long as the change was not brought about by the solicitation and canvassing of the appellant, there could be no good grounds for complaint.\nIf the purpose of the bond was to prevent competition, it is illegal, and it is difficult to see that its main purpose was not to prevent competition. The secrets of trade, if any must have been acquired by the covenantee long before the bond was given. The nature of the business would indicate that in the purchasing and disposing of goods there was little that was secret or peculiar to this company. In opening up the store at Flin Flon, the employer took financial risks which increased as time went on, and gross sales began to decline. Considering the time and circumstances in which the bond was taken, it appears that one of its main objects was to prevent competition. If so, the bond is unenforceable.\nMoreover, the bond goes beyond what is reasonably adequate in furnishing any protection to which the employer could conceivably be entitled. It forbids the covenantee, not only from violating proprietary rights, but from exercising his right to follow his trade or calling in any capacity, however humble or obscure, or however remote from the danger of infringing any proprietary rights of the covenantee.\nFor all these reasons, we think the bond is unreasonable, and is not enforceable. The appeal is allowed and the judgment of the trial judge is restored with costs throughout.\nDavis J.\u2014I agree that this appeal must be allowed and the judgment of the trial judge restored with costs throughout. This conclusion I reach upon the simple ground that a master is not permitted to impose restraint outside of reasonable limits upon his servant, after discharge, from turning his skill and knowledge to the best account and that the respondent (plaintiff) failed to establish facts and circumstances surrounding the employment of the appellant (defendant) sufficient for the Court to say that the agreement was reasonable. The continuance of the appellant in the service of the respondent was in itself sufficient consideration for an agreement imposing a reasonable restraint, but the respondent having failed to establish that the restraint imposed by the agreement was reasonable under all the circumstances, the action to enforce the agreement must fail. The appeal should be allowed and the judgment at the trial restored with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: C. C. Sparling.\nSolicitor for the respondent: J.

Davis J.\u2014The petitioner, dame Marie-Anna Sarrazin, moved before me for special leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, rendered on January 31, 1935[2], whereby an order of Mr. Justice Boyer, granting her petition in bankruptcy for a receiving order against the respondent, Les cur\u00e9 et marguilliers de l\u2019\u0153uvre et fabrique de la paroisse de St-Gabriel de Brandon, was quashed upon the ground that the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act do not apply to the respondent. A similar decision upon somewhat similar facts, Demoiselle Bricault et autres v. Les cur\u00e9 et marguilliers de l\u2019\u0152uvre et fabrique de la paroisse de Saint-Etienne (2), was rendered by the Court of King\u2019s Bench.\nThe appellate court from which leave to appeal to this Court is now sought held that the respondent was not a corporation within the definition of that word in the Bankruptcy Act, section 2 (k) which is as follows:\n\u201cCorporation\u201d means any company incorporated or authorized to carry on business by or under an Act of the Parliament of Canada or of any of the provinces of Canada, and any incorporated company, wheresoever incorporated, which has an office in or carries on business within Canada, but does not include building societies having a capital stock nor incorporated banks, savings banks, insurance companies, trust companies, loan companies or railway companies.\nCounsel for the petitioner admits that the respondent has no corporate existence by statute or otherwise and, while not abandoning the contention advanced by him in the courts below that the respondent is in the nature of a corporation, now puts his case mainly upon the definition of the word \u201cperson\u201d in the Bankruptcy Act, section 2 (cc) which is as follows:\n\u201cPerson\u201d includes a firm, or partnership, an unincorporated association of persons, a corporation as restrictively defined by this section, a body corporate and politic, the successors of such association, partnership, corporation, or body corporate and politic, and the heirs, executors, administrators or other legal representative of a person according to the law of that part of Canada to which the context extends.\nIt is useful in considering the matter to refer to the definition in the Act of the word \u201cdebtor\u201d\u2014section 2 (p).\n\u201cDebtor\u201d includes any person, whether a British subject or not, who, at the time when any act of bankruptcy was done or suffered by him, or any authorized assignment was made by him.\n(i) was personally present in Canada, or\n(ii) ordinarily resided or had a place of residence in Canada, or (iii) was carrying on business in Canada personally or by means of an agent or manager, or\n(iv) was a corporation or a member of a firm or partnership which carried on business in Canada.\nCounsel do not substantially differ in their statements as to the nature of the respondent. Counsel for the petitioner says that the cur\u00e9 and the three elected wardens of the parish constitute what he terms a special board empowered to manage the temporal affairs of the parish. Counsel for the respondent describes the respondent as a council of administration charged with the administration of the affairs of the parish.\nI have no doubt that the Bankruptcy Act was never intended to apply to a parish or church or other religious body. Clear and explicit language would be necessary to bring ecclesiastical bodies or institutions within the ambit of a bankruptcy statute essentially designed for the administration of the property of persons or corporations carrying on business.\nMoreover, the petitioner\u2019s debt is represented by two promissory notes aggregating $525 signed in the name of the respondent by a former cur\u00e9 of the parish. A very serious question was raised by the present cur\u00e9 and wardens when this bankruptcy petition was filed that the parish was not bound in law by these notes signed by the former cur\u00e9 alone, and it appears that many other notes of similar kind extending into very large sums of money are outstanding. Counsel for the petitioner admits that before this petition was filed he knew that the present cur\u00e9 and wardens repudiated any liability on the part of the parish for payment of the two notes upon which the petition was founded. The question of liability of the parish for these notes was something that had to be faced as a matter of law at the very outset in order to establish the relation of debtor and creditor between the petitioner and the respondent. The learned judge before whom the petition came took evidence on this issue and determined that the respondent was liable. Then in order to establish the essential fact of insolvency, the present cur\u00e9 was asked whether the parish could meet all the known outstanding notes of similar kind to those upon which the petition was based if the question of liability were determined against the parish, and the cur\u00e9 admitted that if there was liability on the parish in respect of all similar notes, running into very large amounts, the parish would be unable to pay them. That was not proof of the act of bankruptcy charged against the respondent that it had ceased to meet its liabilities generally as they became due. I do not feel justified in granting leave in this case, and the motion must therefore be dismissed with costs.\nMotion dismissed with costs.\n[1] (1925) Q.R. 58 K.B. 123.\n[2] (1935) Q.R. 58 K.B. 123.\n",

(ibid) dismissing his actions, it was held that said statutory condition did not afford a defence to the respondent insurance companies; the course of the litigation precluded them from relying upon any charge of actual fraud; and, while the plaintiff\u2019s (appellant\u2019s) agent\u2019s partial statement of the facts to the insurance agent (in stating that there were fires \u201call over the country\u201d; without disclosing that there was a fire in McNish township, which, as known to plaintiff but not to plaintiff\u2019s agent, adjoined the township in which was the lumber camp proposed to be insured) might, if calculated to mislead the insurance agent, amount to a misrepresentation, yet this was an issue of fact not suggested by the insurance companies at the trial, and the evidence did not shew that the insurance agent was misled; further, a misrepresentation, to produce a legal effect, must be one influencing the other party to enter the contract, and it did not appear that anything said by the plaintiff\u2019s agent influenced the insurance agent in assenting to effect the insurance. (Smith v. Chad- wick, 9 App. Cas. 187, at 195-197, cited). The appeal was allowed and judgment given for the insured.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] dismissing his appeal from the judgment of Kelly J.1 dismissing his actions. The plaintiff brought five separate actions, each against an insurance company to recover its proportionate share of a loss sustained by plaintiff through the destruction by fire of his camp buildings and equipment, which, he claimed, had been validily insured by them. The actions were tried together. The appeals to this Court were, by order, consolidated and proceeded with as one appeal.\nThe facts are discussed at length in the judgments below[2]. The plaintiff, a lumberman residing in North Bay, Ontario, owned certain camp buildings and equipment situate in the township of MacBeth in the District of Sudbury in the Province of Ontario. On May 24, 1932, the forests in MacBeth and in the adjoining townships were very dry and there were numerous forest fires in various parts of the district other than the township of MacBeth. On that day a forest fire started in the township of McNish, which adjoins the township of MacBeth. In the afternoon of that day the chief forester for the North Bay District by telephone informed the plaintiff\u2019s wife (the plaintiff being absent from home) of the fire in McNish. About six or six-thirty o\u2019clock in the evening she got in touch by telephone with the plaintiff who was some 150 miles distant. He asked her to telephone Mr. Kennedy, a local insurance agent in North Bay, through whom insurance on this camp had in former years been placed, and to have the property in question insured. This she did that evening, and Kennedy (who was authorized by the defendant companies to issue policies) undertook, over the telephone, to hold the property in question covered or insured to the same extent as in previous years. The plaintiff\u2019s wife, in her evidence, stated that Mr. Kennedy had asked her \u201care there any fires?\u201d to which she answered \u201cYes, all over the country\u201d; but that she did not mention McNish; that at that time she did not know, though the plaintiff did, that McNish was next to MacBeth. The policies were completed about ten or eleven o\u2019clock the next day (May 25th). The property in question was burned about noon or one o\u2019clock on the 25th, from the fire which had extended from its starting point in McNish. The policies were delivered on the morning of the 26th, at which time Kennedy knew that the fire in question had occurred, but felt bound by his above mentioned undertaking on May 24th. Subsequently on the same day plaintiff paid the premium, which was subsequently tendered back by the companies but was not accepted by the plaintiff.\nCounsel for the defendant companies, at the opening of the trial, said:\nMr. Taylor is a gentleman of good standing in the community, and we do not desire to suggest that either Mrs. Taylor or Mr. Taylor was guilty of fraud in the ordinary sense of the word, but we say in law what happened consisted of fraudulent omission to notify the agent who, of course, had no knowledge of the fact that the fire was raging or of the existence of the fire. It seems to me that that is a question more of law than fact. There is some fact in it, of course.\nThe actions were tried with a jury; but the trial judge submitted only one question to them, reserving all others to the Court. The question submitted to the jury was: \u201cDid Mrs. Taylor tell Mr. Kennedy, when asking him to place the insurance, that there were fires all over the country?\u201d (as to which matter there was dispute in the evidence, Mr. Kennedy stating that he did not make \u201cany query as to any fires\u201d), and the jury\u2019s answer was \u201cyes.\u201d The trial judge reserved judgment, and subsequently delivered judgment dismissing the actions. An appeal by the plaintiff to the Court of Appeal was dismissed; and plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nPeter White K.C. and Grant Gordon for the appellant.\nD.L. McCarthy K.C. and J.D. Watt for the respondents.\nThe judgment of Duff C.J. and Cannon and Crocket JJ. was delivered by\nDUFF C.J.\u2014I think I can most conveniently explain my view of the questions in controversy on this appeal by first reproducing textually the first condition to be read into fire insurance policies in Ontario by force of 14 Geo. V., ch. 50, sec. 92; and also, textually, the condition which it replaced (R.S.O. 1914, ch. 183, sec. 194). The condition under the first mentioned statute is in these words: If any person applying for insurance falsely describes the property to the prejudice of the insurer, or misrepresents or fraudulently omits to communicate any circumstance which is material to be made known to the insurer in order to enable it to judge of the risk to be undertaken, the contract shall be void as to the property in respect of which the misrepresentation or omission is made.*\nThe condition under the earlier statute (R.S.O. 1914, ch. 183, sec. 194) is as follows:\n1. If any person insures property, and causes the same to be described otherwise than as it really is to the prejudice of the company, or misrepresents or omits to communicate any circumstance which is material to be made known to the company, in order to enable it to judge of the risk it undertakes, such insurance shall be of no force in respect to the property in regard to which the misrepresentation or omission is made.\nThe only material change in the condition, as prescribed by the later statute, is effected by introducing the adverb \u201cfraudulently\u201d before the verb \u201comits.\u201d\nMy view of these words is that the adverb \u201cfraudulently\u201d connotes actual fraud. I think the words of this condition must be read in their ordinary sense, and that such is the ordinary sense of them. True it is that the term \u201cfraud\u201d is, and has always been, employed by lawyers in different senses. Where a fiduciary relation exists, a violation of a fiduciary duty without fraudulent intention may amount to fraud in the contemplation of a court of equity. Again, in the case of contracts uberrimae fidei, the insurance contract for example, a failure to disclose a material fact, however innocent from the moral point of view, or a misstatement of fact, however innocent from the same point of view, is conduct to which lawyers commonly apply the term \u201cfraud.\u201d\nWe are not concerned with frauds consisting in a breach of duty arising out of a fiduciary relation; and it is too plain for argument that if the term \u201cfraudulently\u201d is used in this statutory condition to describe an innocent breach of the duty to disclose material facts which rests upon the insured under a contract of insurance, then the amendment of the condition effected by the legislation of 14 Geo. V. was merely pleonastic.\nI think the course of the litigation precludes the respondent from relying upon any charge of actual fraud. No such charge was pleaded. At the opening of the trial there was an application to strike out the jury notice on the ground that the questions involved were really questions of law. Counsel for the respondent disclaimed any intention of charging \u201cfraud in the ordinary sense.\u201d He announced his intention of contending that the failure to disclose material facts in breach of the duty to disclose constituted a fraudulent omission within the contemplation of the condition as amended\u2014\u201cfraud in law,\u201d as he described it. An amendment was allowed permitting the respondent to set up the condition, but no amendment was allowed or asked for alleging fraud in fact.\nDuring the course of the trial, counsel for the respondents disclaimed, on more than one occasion, any imputation of intentional wrongdoing on behalf of the plaintiff or his wife. Then, at the conclusion of the trial, there was some discussion about the submission of questions to the jury. What occurred on that occasion is rather important, and I quote from the record:\nMr. WHITE: At the request of your Lordship made to my friend and myself to discuss the question as to what, if anything, is to be left to the jury\u2014\nHis LORDSHIP: Questions of fact.\nMr. WHITE: I submit that there should be left to the jury the question as to whether there was on the part of the plaintiff or his agent an omission to communicate to the agent of the insurance company any circumstances material to be made known to the defendants in order to enable them to judge of the risk to be undertaken, and also this further question: If so, was such omission fraudulent?\nHis LORDSHIP: \u201cOmitted fraudulently with intent to deceive,\u201d if you are following the language of the section.\nMr. HENDERSON: \u201cFraudulently\u201d within the meaning of the first statutory condition.\nMr. WHITE: No; I think I will leave it.\nHis LORDSHIP: I will put this on record as if it were taking place in court in the absence of the jury. My present inclination is that, after having heard all the evidence, I must conclude that the questions of law and fact are generally so involved that the case can be better disposed of without the assistance of the jury, but I am willing that there should be submitted to the jury any questions purely as to fact; and later, in view of this ruling, counsel have agreed that I should submit this question:\nQ. Did Mrs. Taylor tell Mr. Kennedy, when asking him to place the insurance, that there were fires all over the country?\nThat is the only thing upon which counsel need address the jury.\nThe learned trial judge dismissed the action. The material part of his judgment I set out verbatim:\nThe important question is whether plaintiff, through his wife as his agent or otherwise, made full and frank disclosure to the defendants or their representatives of all such matters as were material to be made known to them in order to enable them to judge of the risk to be undertaken. Kennedy, with several years\u2019 acquaintance with and knowledge of plaintiff, says he is not the sort of person who would fraudulently misrepresent. From what I observed, I would expect the same to be said of plaintiff\u2019s wife. She says she was not then aware of the location of McNish township with reference to the township of MacBeth. While it must be taken that she told Kennedy there were fires all over the country, she did not tell him what Greenwood said about the fire in the township of McNish nor did plaintiff by any other means convey to the defendants\u2019 representatives the information which he had that there was a fire in McNish. While defendants\u2019 representatives must have been aware of the existence of bush fires in some localities, they could not reasonably be presumed to have known that there was a fire in McNish township. A definite and express mention of a fire in that township would have localized their knowledge and might have so affected their judgment and decision in the matter as to result in a refusal on their part to undertake the risk. This is a reasonable inference independent of the evidence at the trial of Kennedy and witnesses Hamilton and McBride on that point. It appears to me that Greenwood\u2019s information on the 24th that there was a fire in the township of McNish indicated to plaintiff that danger to his camp was imminent. He has admitted that until May 24th he did nothing in regard to placing insurance on this property. On that day he seems to have been stirred into action by learning that there was a fire in McNish. That information was manifestly material and important to him; in any event he so regarded it; and being material and important to him who then, and no doubt in consequence thereof, desired and gave instructions to have insurance placed on the property, why not equally material and important to defendants and their representatives who were asked to assume and did assume the risk? In my opinion, the existence of a fire in the township of McNish was a material fact within the knowledge of plaintiff at the time the insurance was effected which he did not disclose, but omitted to communicate to the insurers. It has been contended that he did not fraudulently omit to communicate that fact. The omission may not have been fraudulent in the sense that he deliberately withheld the information with intent to deceive the insurers; but I do think that it was fraudulent in the sense that he did not observe that good faith towards the insurers which his duty to them called upon him to observe, in that he did not make a full disclosure of this material fact. The duty which rests upon an owner in effecting insurance is dealt with in Welford and Otter-Barry\u2019s Law relating to Fire Insurance, 3rd Edition, at p. 126 and following pages, where many reported cases are cited which I need only refer to. I draw attention, however, to the case of Carter v. Boehm[3], because of these statements therein of Lord Mansfield (at page 1909) in regard to non-disclosure of a material fact, even without fraudulent intentions:\u2014\n\u201cInsurance is a contract upon speculation. The special facts, upon which the contingent chance is to be computed, lie most commonly in the knowledge of the insured only; the underwriter trusts to his representation, and proceeds upon confidence that he does not keep back any circumstance in his knowledge, to mislead the underwriter into a belief that the circumstance does not exist, and to induce him to estimate the risque, as if it did not exist. The keeping back such circumstance is a fraud, and therefore the policy is void. Although the suppression should happen through mistake, without any fraudulent intention, yet still the underwriter is deceived, and the policy is void; because the risque run is really different from the risque understood and intended to be run, at the time of the agreement.\u201d\nThe issue with which the learned judge is dealing in this passage is stated in his first sentence:\nThe important question is whether plaintiff, through his wife as his agent or otherwise, made full and frank disclosure to the defendants or their representatives of all such matters as were material to be made known to them in order to enable them to judge of the risk to be undertaken.\nHe finds that there was a fraudulent omission within the meaning of the condition, but his construction of the condition is made clear by this sentence:\nThe omission may not have been fraudulent in the sense that he deliberately withheld the information with intent to deceive the insurers; but I do think that it was fraudulent in the sense that he did not observe that good faith towards the insurers which his duty to them called upon him to observe, in that he did not make a full disclosure of this material fact.\nand by his reproduction of the passage from Lord Mansfield\u2019s judgment in Carter v. Boehm[4].\nNo issue of fraud in fact, that is to say, of fraudulent intention, was pronounced upon by the learned trial judge or was tried. No charge of fraud in that sense was made. Indeed, as we have seen, the intention to make any such charge was explicitly disclaimed.\nIn the Court of Appeal, the learned Chief Justice of Ontario accepted the judgment of the trial judge and based his own judgment on the grounds therein explained. Mr. Justice Masten negatives fraud. Mr. Justice Macdonnell negatives actual or \u201cmoral\u201d fraud.\nThe substantial question upon which we have to pass is that which is raised in the very clear and forcible judgment of Mr. Justice Davis. Put concisely, his view is this: the appellant knew that there were fires not far from his camp; that his camp was in danger, and, although Mrs. Taylor herself was not aware of this, her statement is Taylor\u2019s statement, and her statement that there were fires all over the country, without disclosing that they were fires in the vicinity of the camps, amounted to misrepresentation. Now, whether or not that is so, is a question of fact. If Mrs. Taylor\u2019s partial statement of the facts was calculated to mislead the person to whom it was addressed, then it might amount to a misrepresentation. But no such issue of fact was suggested by the respondents at the trial. The agent Kennedy, who was called as a witness, does not intimate that he was in any way misled by anything that Mrs. Taylor said. I should not be prepared myself to find as a fact, in view of what occurred at the trial, that such was the case.\nBut there is a more serious difficulty. A misrepresentation in the air is of no legal consequence. It must, to produce such effects, as the phrase is, be dans locum contractui; that is to say, it must be a misrepresentation influencing the other party to enter the contract. As I have said, the witness with whom Mrs. Taylor had the conversation in the course of which this misrepresentation, if it was such, occurred, does not suggest that anything Mrs. Taylor said to him had any effect on his mind of any description whatever; much less that it influenced him in assenting to effect the insurance. My conclusion, from the evidence as a whole, is that it had no such effect.\nI think Lord Blackburn\u2019s language in Smith v. Chadwick[5] is in point. At pp. 195-197, he says:\nIn an ordinary action of deceit the plaintiff alleges that false and fraudulent representations were made by the defendant to the plaintiff in order to induce him, the plaintiff, to act upon them. I think that if he did act upon these representations, he shews damage; if he did not, he shews none. And I think the plaintiff in such a case must not only allege but prove this damage. It is as to what is sufficient proof of this damage that I wish to make my remarks. I do not think it is necessary, in order to prove this, that the plaintiff always should be called as a witness to swear that he acted upon the inducement. At the time when Pasley v. Freeman[6] was decided, and for many years afterwards, he could not be so called. I think that if it is proved that the defendants with a view to induce the plaintiff to enter into a contract made a statement to the plaintiff of such a nature as would be likely to induce a person to enter into a contract, and it is proved that the plaintiff did enter into the contract, it is a fair inference of fact that he was induced to do so by the statement. In Redgrave v. Hurd[7], the late Master of the Rolls is reported to have said it was an inference of law. If he really meant this he retracts it in his observations in the present case. I think it not possible to maintain that it is an inference of law. Its weight as evidence must greatly depend upon the degree to which the action of the plaintiff was likely, and on the absence of all other grounds on which the plaintiff might act. I quite agree that being a fair inference of fact it forms evidence proper to be left to a jury as proof that he was so induced. But I do not think that it would be a proper direction to tell a jury that if convinced that there was such a material representation they ought to find that the plaintiff was induced by it, unless one of the things which the late Master of the Rolls specified was proved; nor do I think he meant to say so. I think there are a great many other things which might make it a fair question for the jury whether the evidence on which they might draw the inference was of such weight that they would draw the inference. And whenever that is a matter of doubt I think the tribunal which has to decide the fact should remember that now, and for some years past, the plaintiff can be called as a witness, on his own behalf, and that if he is not so called, or being so called does not swear that he was induced, it adds much weight to the doubts whether the inference was a true one. I do not say it is conclusive.\nI think the appeal should be allowed and the appellant should have judgment for the amount claimed with costs throughout.\nRINFRET J.: I agree with the Chief Justice that this appeal should be allowed and the appellant should have judgment for the amount claimed, with costs throughout.\nHUGHES J.: I agree with the Chief Justice. The appeal should be allowed with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: White, Ruel & Bristol.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Henderson, Herridge & Gowling.\n[1] [1934] O.R. 273; [1934] 2 D.L.R. 657.\n[2] [1934] O.R. 273; [1934] 2 D.L.R. 657.\n* Reporter\u2019s Note: This became the first statutory condition under s. 98 of The Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1927, c. 222.\n[3] (1766) 3 Burr. 1905.\n[4] (1766) 3 Burr. 1905.\n[5] (1884) 9 App. Cas. 187.\n[6] 2 Sm.

Eaton Company Limited (Defendant) Respondent.\n1934: November 26; 1935: May 13.\nPresent: Duff C.J. and Rinfret, Cannon, Crocket and Hughes JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nNegligence\u2014Injury to pianist while playing in auditorium, from bursting of lens of spotlight\u2014Liability of proprietor of auditorium\u2014Relationship between proprietor and pianist\u2014Mere licensee\u2014Extent of proprietor\u2019s duty.\nDefendant rented its auditorium to H. for a musical recital which H. was giving, and permitted H., without charge, to use it for a rehearsal previous to the recital. Plaintiff, H.\u2019s brother, was, for a fee (which also covered his preparatory work), to assist H. as a pianist in the recital. During the rehearsal, while plaintiff was playing a piano on the stage of the auditorium, the lens of a spotlight suspended above the piano burst and a piece of broken glass cut his hand. He sued defendant for damages.\nHeld: Plaintiff was a mere licensee of defendant, without an interest, plaintiff not having entered the auditorium upon business which concerned defendant upon defendants invitation, express or implied. In such circumstances plaintiff did not come within the rule applied in Indermaur v. Dames, L.R. 1 C.P. 274, L.R. 2 C.P. 311, and certain later cases, which treat a licensee with an interest as being entitled practically to the same degree of protection at the hands of the licensor as an invitee in the usual sense. To bring a person within this category it must be shewn that he was upon the premises for some purpose in which he and the proprietor had a common or joint interest (Hayward v. Drury Lane Theatre, [1917] 2 K.B. 899, at 913; Addie v. Dumbreck, [1929] A.C. 358, at 371). Even if plaintiff had a substantial financial interest in the success of the recital, this would make no difference in the relationship between defendant and plaintiff and would be quite insufficient to make plaintiff a licensee with a joint or common interest as between him and defendant. Plaintiff being a mere licensee, defendant\u2019s only duty to him was not to expose him to a hidden peril or trap, that is, a peril which was not apparent to the licensee but the existence of which was known to the licensor (or which ought to have been known to the licensor, should it be taken from certain dicta in Addie v. Dumbreck, [1929] A.C. 358, and Fairman v. Perpetual Investment Bldg. Soc., [1923] A.C. 74, that the proprietor\u2019s duty is recognized as so enlarged; whether so or not, the law still recognizes a distinct line of demarcation between the duty owed to an invitee and that owed to a mere licensee).\nHeld, further: Upon the evidence, the spotlight in question was not a trap or hidden peril within the meaning of the cases.\nDismissal of the action by the Court of Appeal for Ontario (reversing judgment at trial) was affirmed.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], which reversed the judgment of McEvoy J. in his favour, and dismissed the action. The action was for damages for injury to the plaintiff\u2019s hand caused by its being struck by a piece of broken glass when the lens of a spotlight, suspended above the piano at which the plaintiff was playing on the stage of the defendant\u2019s auditorium, burst. Plaintiff claimed that the injury was caused by defendant\u2019s negligence. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The plaintiff\u2019s appeal to this Court was dismissed with costs.\nJ.E. Corcoran K.C. for the appellant.\nG.W. Mason K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Duff C.J. and Cannon, Crocket and Hughes JJ. was delivered by CROCKET, J.\u2014The appellant, a professional pianist and piano teacher, was playing a piano on the stage of the auditorium of the respondent company in its Toronto departmental store in the forenoon of May 10th, 1932, when the lens of a spotlight suspended above the piano burst and one of the pieces of the broken glass fell upon his left hand and cut his forefinger. The resulting wound was dressed by a surgeon who put four stitches in it. These stitches were taken out a week later when the skin had fully healed but the appellant claimed that he suffered serious damage in consequence of his being incapacitated for the proper carrying on of his lessons with his pupils for some weeks and in the enforced cancellation of several important concert engagements to which he was looking forward as opportunities for enhancing his professional reputation. He brought this action to recover compensation from the respondent as the proprietor of the auditorium, claiming that his injury was caused by the respondent\u2019s negligence.\nAt the time of the accident a rehearsal was in progress of a program for a recital which the appellant\u2019s brother, Boris Hambourg, with the assistance of some other musicians, was to give in the auditorium that night. The latter, through his concert agent, had some time previously entered into a written rental agreement for the use and occupation of the auditorium for the purpose of this recital between the hours of 7 p.m. and 12 p.m. on May 10th at a rental of $125, one of the terms of which was that the lessor should heat, seat and light the auditorium, but that it should not be responsible for any interruption of or interference with such heating or lighting. The lessee upon his part agreed, inter alia, that no alterations should be made to the auditorium, its furnishings or equipment, without the consent of the lessor in writing, and that if any special lights, decorations or settings were required, to the installation of which the lessor might be agreeable, such would be supplied by the lessee at the lessee\u2019s own expense.\nThe lease contained no provision for the holding of any rehearsal but permission had been granted by the respondent\u2019s auditorium manager to Mr. Boris Hambourg to use the auditorium for this purpose without charge dur- ing the forenoon of that day. The appellant was to assist in the recital as a pianist but was not a partner of his brother in the undertaking, having no responsibility for any of the expenses or no right to share in the profits. He was to receive a fee or honorarium of $100 for his participation, which, it was explained, was to cover all his preparatory work therefor.\nThe evidence shews that the rehearsal had been in progress for about two hours when the appellant went to the piano to play an accompaniment for his brother in a particular piece and that he had been at the piano for not more than five or ten minutes when the lens burst. The lights apparently had been on from the beginning of the rehearsal, including the spotlight in question.\nAs to just what happened in connection with the positioning of the spotlight in relation to the piano the evidence is very obscure and unsatisfactory. Mrs. Hambourg says that some red and blue lights had been in use which she told someone\u2014she couldn\u2019t remember whom\u2014she did not like, and that these lights were almost instantaneously turned off, she presumed by a switch, leaving a beam of uncoloured light trained on the piano and that the crash occurred almost instantaneously with the turning off of the coloured lights. Mr. Tait, the manager of the auditorium, who is an experienced electrician, was not on the stage at the time but in some portion of the wing. He said he knew nothing about any request being made for or anything being said about the non-use of coloured lights in connection with the rehearsal or the recital either before or during the progress of the rehearsal, and did not remember Mrs. Hambourg speaking to him at any time about coloured lights. He said he had given the instructions for the hanging of the spotlight because he had been asked to arrange the lighting as it had been for a concert held a few nights before and that he gave these instructions to one or other of two union electricians whom he usually employed for the placing or changing of the stage lights to suit the requirements of the lessees. It appears that these men hung the spotlight in the usual manner from one of several parallel metal pipes or battens extending from one side of the stage to the other, and which were movable up and down by means of pulleys, and that the particular spotlight with which the action is concerned was placed for use on this occasion between 15 and 17 feet above the keyboard of the piano.\nNo evidence was given to shew who placed the piano under the spotlight, or whether the spotlight was suspended from the batten after the position for the piano had been selected, but it appears that a Heintzman concert grand piano had been supplied to Boris Hambourg for special use at the recital, so that one would naturally infer that either the lessee or some of his assistants would select the particular position in which it was to be placed. Neither of the two men who were employed to do the work and actually placed the spotlight in position was called as a witness, and none of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses vouchsafed any explanation as to the placing of the piano directly below the spotlight or who directed it to be placed in that position.\nAlthough no definite evidence was given on the point, it was estimated by a Mr. Gordon Best, an electrician, who gave evidence in behalf of the plaintiff, from two of the broken pieces which fell on the piano, that the lens was an 8-inch diameter lens and several inches thick. It was mounted in the frame or housing containing a 5-inch diameter 1,000 watt bulb 5 inches below the bulb, by means of a grooved ring of spring brass or bronze in which it was firmly held by two small bolts. Provision for ventilation was made by means of a circle of round holes bored through the metal of the hood below the bulb and above these a number of rectangular slits running lengthwise of the lamp. That at least is the effect of the somewhat confused description which was attempted of the ventilation system of the lamp, as I interpret it.\nThese spotlights and the other electrical equipment had been purchased about a year before on the opening of the auditorium by Mr. Tait from the Amalgamated Electric Co. of Toronto, which he described as one of the best electrical equipment firms in the country. The electrical equipment provided for the auditorium, he said, he considered the best on the market, both in construction and design and adaptability to their needs.\nThe action was tried before Mr. Justice McEvoy without a jury. His Lordship found that the defendants knew or ought to have known that the lens was liable to crack from the heat of the bulb and fall and strike anyone upon the stage, and that it was quite impossible on the evidence to hold that the plantiff had any possible chance of knowing the danger created by suspending over the stage such a lens with such a light behind it and that such a piece of mechanism was liable to crack and fall upon the stage. He held that the defendants were negligent in not having inspected the dangerous lens to see that it was in safe condition and in not providing some shield to prevent the same from falling upon the plaintiff or other people lawfully using the stage from time to time, and that upon the evidence the defendants were liable to the plaintiff for the injuries suffered. He assessed the damages at $3,000.\nOn appeal to the Court of Appeal the trial judgment was set aside and the action dismissed, per Mulock, C.J., and Riddell and Middleton, JJ. The Appeal Court held that the plaintiff was nothing more than the licensee of the defendant; that, while he undoubtedly had permission to use the auditorium, the sole right he had as licensee was as a member of the concert company; and that any change which had been made in the premises or its equipment after his entry into the auditorium was made at the express request of those through whom his right as licensee came; that the change was made for his advantage in all probability and that it would be absurd to hold the defendant liable for a change so made; that he was excluded from the rule in Indermaur v. Dames[2]; and that, even if the plaintiff could be considered in the category of invitee, there was no actionable negligence for which the defendant could properly be held liable.\nI am of opinion that the Appeal Court was right in holding upon the evidence that the relationship between the respondent and the appellant was that of a mere licensee without an interest, the latter not having entered the auditorium upon business which concerned the respondent upon the respondent\u2019s invitation, express or implied. In such circumstances the appellant in my judgment does not fall within the rule which was applied in Indermaur v. Dames[3] or in the later cases of Holmes v. North Eastern Ry. Co.[4] and Wright v. London & North Western Ry. Co.[5], all of which treat a licensee with an interest as being entitled practically to the same degree of protection at the hands of the licensor as an invitee in the usual sense. To bring a person within this category, however, it must be shewn that he was upon the premises for some purpose in which he and the proprietor had a common or joint interest, as pointed out by Scrutton, L.J., in Hayward v. Drury Lane Theatre[6], and by Viscount Dunedin in the Scottish Appeal of Addie v. Dumbreck[7] in the House of Lords.\nIn the case at bar the learned trial Judge, in addition to the findings already quoted, held as a fact that the plaintiff had a substantial financial interest in the success of the recital. This, with all respect, I think, makes no difference in the relationship between the respondent and the plaintiff and is quite insufficient to make the latter a licensee with a joint or common interest as between him and the respondent whom he seeks to fix with the same degree of liability as if the respondent were an invitor, and he the respondent\u2019s invitee, that is to say, with the duty on the part of the invitor to the invitee, to quote the words of Willes, J., in Indermaur v. Dames[8] to \u201cuse reasonable care to prevent damage from unusual danger, which he (the invitor) knows or ought to know,\u201d or, as Lord Hailsham, L.C., put it in Addie v. Dumbreck[9], \u201cthe duty of taking reasonable care that the premises are safe.\u201d Apart from contractual obligations, this is the highest duty the law imposes upon proprietors of premises towards those who go upon them, and applies only where persons go upon the premises as invitees of the proprietors. \u201cThe lowest,\u201d said Lord Sumner, then Hamilton, L.J., in Latham v. Johnson[10].\nis the duty towards a trespasser. More care, though not much, is owed to a licensee\u2014more again to an invitee * * * The rule as to licensees, too [as in the case of trespassers], is that they must take the premises as they find them apart from concealed sources of danger; where dangers are obvious they run the risk of them. In darkness where they cannot see whether there is danger or not, if they will walk they walk at their peril. With every word of this passage Viscount Dunedin said in Addie v. Dumbreck[11] he agreed and that it was the law of Scotland as well as that of England. In the same case Lord Hailsham, L.C., said:\u2014\nIn the case of persons who are not there by invitation, but who are there by leave and licence, express or implied, the duty is much less stringent\u2014the occupier has no duty to ensure that the premises are safe, but he is bound not to create a trap or to allow a concealed danger to exist upon the said premises, which is not apparent to the visitor, but which is known\u2014or ought to be known\u2014to the occupier.\nWhether the words \u201cor ought to be known\u201d in the last quoted dictum are to be taken as a recognition that the proprietor\u2019s duty in respect of concealed dangers or \u201ctraps\u201d has been enlarged, is a question upon which there has been much argument. It is clearly obiter, as all the Law Lords taking part agreed that the boy in that case was a trespasser and not a licensee, either with or without an interest. In Fairman v. Perpetual Investment Building Society[12], Lord Atkinson, in discussing the question of \u201ca hidden peril,\u201d also made use of the phrase \u201cof the existence of which he knew, or ought to have known,\u201d and Lord Wrenbury did the same thing. In the following year, in Sutcliffe v. Clients Investment Co.[13] where the question of the correctness and intention of these dicta was elaborately and ably argued, Bankes, L.J., stated that these dicta were obiter and that it did not appear anywhere in the Fairman case[14] that either Lord Atkinson or Lord Wrenbury intended to make any alteration in the law. He added:\u2014\nNo alteration was in fact made if the plaintiff in that case was a licensee with an interest, because there is no material difference between a licensee with an interest and a person who is described as an \u201cinvitee,\u201d that is to say, a person in the position of the plaintiff in Indermaur v. Dames[15].\nScrutton, L.J., said:\u2014\nIf that is law, in what class should this workman be placed? He was allowed by the tenant to be upon the premises for the purpose of doing repairs, and so far as access to the balcony was necessary for that purpose he was there with the consent of the landlords. He was a licensee with an interest. Now I will do nothing to interfere with the classical judgment of Willes J. in Indermaur v. Dames[16].\nAtkin, L.J., agreed. Whether or not the dicta of Lords Atkinson, Wrenbury and Hailsham are accepted as recognizing any extension of the proprietor\u2019s obligation in respect of concealed dangers by making the liability of a proprietor of premises for a concealed danger depend not only upon his actual knowledge, but upon his means of knowledge as well\u2014or what he ought to have known\u2014it is quite apparent that the law still recognizes a distinct line of demarcation between the duty owed by a proprietor of premises to one who is an invitee and to another who is a mere licensee. Indeed the very dicta themselves, from which the debated alternative phrase has been extracted to support the extension of the principle contended for, afford conclusive evidence that it was never intended thereby to place invitees and mere licensees in the same category as regards the proprietor\u2019s responsibility towards them. Witness Lord Hailsham\u2019s statement that in the case of persons who go upon the premises by leave and licence, express or implied, the duty is much less stringent, than in the case of those who are present by the invitation of the occupier. If there were not still a material and very important distinction between the two degrees of duty, can it be supposed that Viscount Dunedin in the very same case would have emphasized as he did that in considering cases of that class the first duty of the trial tribunal was \u201cto fix once and for all into which of the three classes the person in question falls\u201d (trespassers, licensees or invitees) and apply the law governing that category without \u201clooking to the law of the adjoining category?\u201d Or that His Lordship should have used such a striking expression as:\n\u201cThere is no half-way house, no no-man\u2019s land between adjacent territories\u201d?\nFor my part I cannot think that it was intended, by the use of the debated alternative phrase in defining an owner\u2019s or occupier\u2019s liability for a concealed danger in the quoted passages relied upon, to lay down the principle that the owner or occupier owed the same duty to a licensee without an interest as to an invitee.\nThe appellant being a mere licensee, the respondent\u2019s only duty to him was not to expose him to a hidden peril or trap, that is, as I understand it, a peril, which was not apparent to the licensee but the existence of which was known to the licensor\u2014(or, if one is disposed to add the alternative phrase above discussed) or which ought to have been known to the licensor.\nWas, then, this spotlight, suspended above the piano in the position described, with no netting or screen below it to prevent pieces of broken glass falling upon persons or objects on the stage floor in the event of the lens cracking or bursting, a trap or hidden peril within the meaning of the cases?\nI am of opinion that it was not.\nThere is but one conclusion, I think, which can reasonably be drawn from the evidence regarding the bursting of the lens, viz: that it broke, either in consequence of some latent defect in the glass itself or in consequence of its becoming overheated from the incandescent lamp in the hood above. There was no fore-warning of impending danger. No evidence of anything else than the sudden, instantaneous crash itself. No flaw or defect whatsoever in the lens or any part of the spotlight, so far as the evidence discloses, which was visible or discoverable, to indicate that it held any danger that would not be common to all other spotlights of the same type. The most thorough examination possible before the occurrence of the accident would not have revealed to the manager of the auditorium any more than to the appellant or anybody else that the lens was likely to burst.\nThis particular spotlight had been used with others of the same type for more than a year since the opening of the auditorium. The lens had never cracked before, even though it seems that it had at times been mounted on the stage floor or a table in a reverse position with the lens above the bulb\u2014a position in which the manager admitted some lenses had cracked\u2014but he had never known of one to crack in a spotlight suspended from above with the lens below the bulb. Best, the plaintiff\u2019s witness, admitted that the tendency of a lens to crack was much greater where it was above the lamp than where it was below, and it is obvious that such ample provision as was made for the ventilation of the hood of the particular one in question might reasonably be relied upon by anyone to remove all danger of the lens becoming overheated from an incandescent light above it. The auditorium manager had never known any lens to crack from overheating from an incandescent lamp placed above it. Neither had Donald Cowburne, the only other electri- cian who gave evidence in behalf of the respondent. Gordon Best, the appellant\u2019s expert, although he stated he had heard of it, was unable to give a single specific instance. Cowburne testified that when lenses did crack they usually cracked directly across the lens; and that it was quite unusual for them to break in any other way.\nApart from the fact that the lens did burst on the occasion in question there was no evidence whatever, it seems to me, to suggest that the spotlight was a source of danger, and, even after the event, the entire evidence leaves it exceedingly problematical as to whether the bursting was in reality caused by the overheating of the lens or by some latent undiscovered defect in the glass.\nBe this as it may, the spotlight itself, which had no visible or discoverable flaw or defect, suspended as it was without a protecting shield, was in no sense a trap or hidden peril. If it held any danger, which might reasonably have been anticipated at all, that danger was in no manner a hidden or concealed one. It must have been quite as apparent to any visitor on the stage floor, and especially to one who went to the piano to play in and directly under its flood light, as to the auditorium manager or the particular workman who had placed it in position. The only conceivable ground, in my judgment, upon which it could be held to be a concealed danger within the meaning of the cases would be, either that the auditorium manager knew that the lens was likely to become overheated from the incandescent lamp above it and to burst, or that he ought to have known of that likelihood. That he was convinced that there was no such danger and that the spotlight in the position in which it was placed was absolutely safe cannot, I think, be doubted upon the evidence. This being so, it seems to me to be quite impossible to hold either that he knew the lens was likely to become overheated and burst or that he ought to have known that to be the case.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nRINFRET J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Crocket that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Godfrey & Corcoran.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Mason, Foulds, Davidson, Carter & Kellock.\n[1] [1934] O.W.N. 115.\n[2] (1866) L.R. 1 C.P. 274; L.R. 2 C.P. 311.\n[3] (1866) L.R., 1 C.P. 274, affirmed L.R. 2 C.P. 311.\n[4] (1869) L.R. 4 Ex. 254; (1871) L.R. 6 Ex. 123.\n[5] (1876) 1 Q.B.D., 252.\n[6] [1917] 2 K.B. 899, at 913.\n[7] [1929] A.C. 358, at 371.\n[8] (1866) L.R. 1 C.P. 274.\n[9] [1929] A.C. 358.\n[10] [1913] 1 K.B. 398, at 410-411.\n[11] [1929] A.C.358.\n[12] [1923] A.C. 74.\n[13] [1924] 2 K.B. 746.\n[14] [1923] A.C. 74.\n[15] L.R. 1 C.P. 274; L.R. 2 C.P. 311\n[16] L.R. 1 C.P. 274, 288.\n",

Fraser (Defendant) Respondent.\n1935: May 2, 3; 1935: June 10.\nPresent: Lamont, Cannon, Crocket and Davis JJ. and Dysart J. ad hoc.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nSecurities Act\u2014Investigation\u2014Delegation of authority\u2014Nature of proceedings\u2014Whether judicial\u2014Right to cross-examine witnesses\u2014Natural justice\u2014Right to injunction\u2014Section 29 as bar\u2014Security Frauds Prevention Act\u2014B.C. (1930) c. 64, ss. 10, 29.\nAuthority was delegated by the Attorney-General under section 10 of the Securities Fraud Prevention Act to the respondent to conduct investigations to ascertain whether any fraudulent act or any offence against the Act or the regulations has been, was being or was about to be committed by Wayside Consolidated Gold Mines Limited, and for that purpose to examine any person, company or thing whatsoever. During the course of the investigation by the respondent, it became apparent that the Vancouver Stock and Bond Company Limited, one of the appellants, had been an underwriter of the securities of the Wayside Company, and the appellant St. John, who was a shareholder and the business manager of the underwriting company, was called upon and did give evidence. The investigation extended over several months, from the date of the respondent's appointment on August 15, 1934, until October 22, 1934, during which time a great deal of evidence was taken, on which last day the appellants issued a writ against the investigator Fraser for an injunction to restrain him from proceeding further with the investigation in so far as it either directly or indirectly related to the conduct of the appellants and from making any finding or report to the Attorney-General in connection therewith. The appellants' grounds for an injunction were that the respondent Fraser had not given them notice of the examination of witnesses concerning the appellants' relations with the Wayside Consolidated Gold Mines Limited and that he had not afforded them an opportunity of cross-examining such witnesses, as their status and reputation may be affected by such examination. The trial judge maintained a motion to dissolve the interim injunction, which judgment was affirmed by the appellate court.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal (49 B.C.R. 502), that the respondent investigator could not be restrained from proceeding with the investigation.\nPer Lamont, Cannon and Crocket JJ.\u2014Section 29 of the Securities Act, which purports to bar actions and proceedings by way of injunction or other extraordinary remedy, relating to investigations by the Attorney-General or his representative under the provisions of the statute constitutes an insuperable barrier to the appellant's claim. Per Lamont, Cannon and Crocket JJ.\u2014The investigation provided for by the Securities Act was not a judicial proceeding in any sense of the term but was intended to be conducted by the investigator in private and no person or company should have the right of cross-examining any witness or witnesses brought before the investigator whether the evidence of such witness or witnesses should affect the status or reputation of such person or company or not. Such investigation is in no sense a judicial proceeding for the trial of any offence but merely an enquiry conducted for the information of the Attorney-General in order that the latter may take such proceedings as he may deem advisable in the circumstances for the protection of the public as shown by the provisions of ss. 11 and 12.\nPer Lamont and Davis JJ.\u2014The investigation provisions of the statute dealing generally with the prevention of fraud by stock brokers were part and parcel of the administrative machinery for the attainment of the general purposes of the statute. The investigator was not a court of law nor was he a court in law. While the investigator was bound to act judicially in the sense of being fair and impartial, that is something quite different from the right asserted by the appellants of freedom of cross-examination of all the witnesses.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] maintaining the judgment of the trial judge, Morrison C.J.S.C.[2] , and dissolving an interim injunction restraining the respondent from proceeding further in connection with the investigation being held by him into the affairs of the Wayside Consolidated Gold Mines Limited pursuant to the authority delegated to him by the Attorney-General under the Securities Fraud Prevention Act in so far as the same either directly or indirectly related to the conduct or actions of the appellants, and from making any finding or report to the Attorney-General in connection therewith until judgment in the appellants' action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nJ. W. de B. Farris K.C. for the appellant.\nGordon McG. Sloan K.C. and G. R. Nicholson for the respondents.\nLAMONT J.\u2014In this case I agree with the conclusions reached by my brothers Crocket and Davis, and for the reasons given by them respectively. I would therefore dismiss the appeal with costs. The judgment of Cannon and Crocket JJ. was delivered by\nCROCKET J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[3] dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Morrison, C.J.[4] , dissolving an interim injunction granted by him restraining the respondent Fraser from proceeding with an investigation which he was making into the affairs of Wayside Consolidated Gold Mines Limited, in pursuance of the instructions of the Attorney-General of British Columbia under the provisions of the Securities Act, c. 64, statutes of British Columbia (1930), in so far as the said investigation directly or indirectly related to the conduct or actions of the appellants or either of them, and from making any finding or report to the Attorney-General in connection therewith.\nThe action, which was merely for the injunction, was commenced on October 22, 1934, against the respondent Fraser only and the interim injunction granted on the same day. The Attorney-General was added as a party defendant and joined with Mr. Fraser in a motion which was heard by the learned Chief Justice on October 30, to dissolve the injunction and dismiss the action.\nIt appears from the affidavits used on the hearing of this motion that the Wayside Consolidated Gold Mines had made a new issue of stock, of which the Vancouver Stock and Bond Company Limited had underwritten a large amount, which it was endeavouring to sell on the market, and that the facts in connection with the issue and sale of this stock was the principal subject-matter of the investigation. The appellant St. John was a shareholder and business manager of the Stock and Bond Company and was examined by Mr. Fraser on August 22, August 30, October 15 and October 18, 1934, the solicitor for the appellants being present at all these examinations and their counsel (Mr. Farris) at the last two. Both the solicitor and the counsel took part in these examinations of their client and Mr. Farris as counsel was afforded the fullest opportunity for argument on his client's behalf. Mr. Fraser had in the meantime examined some other witnesses on matters concerning the appellants' conduct in relation to the sale of the stock without notice to the appellants, whose counsel had no opportunity of cross-examining them. Mr. Fraser alleges in his affidavit that no application was ever made to him by either the solicitor or counsel for the appellants or by Mr. St. John himself and that no request was at any time made to him for any advance notice to be given to them respecting any person or persons whom he proposed to examine or for the privilege of cross-examining any witnesses who had been examined. He states that on October 12 the appellants' counsel requested a copy of the evidence of two particular witnesses which had previously been taken and that he informed him that in view of the fact that the appellant St. John was about to be recalled to give further evidence he would furnish counsel with copies of the transcript of the evidence so requested after Mr. St. John had been further examined, and suggested that counsel could recall him to give any further evidence or explanation that might be desired. He further states that the appellants' counsel agreed that such procedure was satisfactory and that thereafter he furnished him with copies of the evidence requested for his perusal. It was admitted, however, on the argument before us that the Attorney-General had taken the position after Mr. Farris's intervention in the case as counsel that he was not entitled to cross-examine any of the witnesses who had been examined by Mr. Fraser in the course of the investigation and that he, the Attorney-General, had so instructed his investigator.\nThe whole question involved in this appeal is as to whether the respondent Fraser could properly be restrained from proceeding with the investigation and making a report or finding to the Attorney-General on the ground that he had not given notice to the appellants of the examination of witnesses concerning the appellants' relations with the Wayside Consolidated Gold Mines Limited and their conduct regarding the sale of the stock referred to and that he had not afforded them an opportunity of cross-examining such witnesses. The solution of this question is to be found, in my judgment, only in the provisions of the statute. See the observations of Lords Thankerton and Macmillan in Hearts of Oak Assurance Co. v. Attorney- General[5]. See also In re The Grosvenor and West End Terminus Hotel Co. Ltd[6]., and O'Connor v. Waldron[7] .\nUnless by virtue of other provisions of the statute it can properly be held that the investigation was a judicial or quasi-judicial proceeding and that the opportunity of cross-examining any witness examined by the investigator on matters affecting the appellants' status or reputation was such an essential requirement in the conduct of the investigation as went to the investigator's jurisdiction to proceed with it, section 29 clearly constitutes an insuperable barrier to the appellants' claim, as held by Mr. Justice McPhillips. This section is as follows:\nNo action whatever, and no proceedings by way of injunction, mandamus, prohibition, or other extraordinary remedy, shall lie or be instituted against any person, whether in his public or private capacity, or against any company in respect of any act or omission in connection with the administration or carrying out of the provisions of this Act or the regulations where such person is the Attorney-General or his representative, or the Registrar, or where such persons or company was proceeding under the written or verbal direction or consent of any one of them, or under an order of the Supreme Court or a Judge thereof made under the provisions of this Act.\nAs to whether the affording to all persons, whose status and reputation may be affected, of the opportunity to cross-examine any and every witness brought before the investigator is such an essential requirement as goes to the investigator's jurisdiction, depends on the nature and purpose of the investigation as evidenced by the provisions of the entire statute.\nUpon a careful consideration of all the sections referred to on the argument and the entire statute, I have come to the conclusion that the only reasonable inference to be drawn therefrom is that the Legislature never intended that notice should be given to any and every person, whose status or reputation might be affected thereby, of the examination of any other witness or witnesses and that any and all such persons should be afforded the privilege of cross-examining any such witness or witnesses. The whole tenor of the statute in my judgment points quite the other way. While section 10 provides that the Attorney-General may delegate authority to any person to examine any person, company, property or thing whatsoever at any time in order to ascertain whether any fraudulent act or any offence against this Act or the regulations has been, is being or is about to be committed,\nand no doubt contemplates a report to the Attorney-General, where the investigation is conducted by a person named and authorized by him, the person so authorized is given no power to make any adjudication which is under any of the provisions of the statute in any sense binding upon the Attorney-General or upon anyone else. While it may be said to contemplate a finding upon the question as to whether any fraudulent act or any offence against the statute or the regulations has been, is being or is about to be committed, such finding, I think, is intended only for the purpose of communicating to the Attorney-General the opinion he has formed as the result of the examination he has made, precisely as in the case of the inspector's report to the commissioner in Hearts of Oak Assurance Co. v. The Attorney-Genera[8]l , as pointed out by Lord Macmillan.\nThat the investigation is in no sense a judicial proceeding for the trial of any offence but merely an enquiry conducted for the information of the Attorney General in order that the latter may take such proceedings as he may deem advisable in the circumstances for the protection of the public is shown clearly by the provisions of ss. 11 and 12. If the Attorney-General as a result of his representative's investigation was of opinion that the appellant St. John was concerned in any fraudulent act or offence against the statute or the regulations which had been, was being or was about to be committed, he as the responsible minister designated to administer the Act might suspend his privileges as a registered broker for any period not exceeding ten days. If he considered such a suspension inadequate he might apply to the Supreme Court or a Judge thereof for an order restraining him or any broker concerned in such fraudulent act or offence against the statute from trading in any security whatever absolutely or for such period of time as should seem just, or for an order restraining either or both the appellants from trading in the security with reference to which any fraudulent act or offence had been or was about to be committed, or from trading in any security whatever. And he might in any case give notice of any fraudulent act to which the appellants or either of them was a party, to the public by advertisement or otherwise or to any individual by letter or otherwise as in his discretion he should deem advisable. It is the Attorney-General and not his investigator, when he authorizes another to make the investigation for him, who determines under s. 11 (c) whether notice of the fraudulent act shall in any case be given to the public by advertisement or otherwise or to any individual by letter or otherwise. It cannot well be supposed that this provision of the statute contemplates his giving any such notice unless he upon a consideration of the investigator's report himself fully agrees with his investigator that a fraudulent act has actually been, was being or was about to be committed.\nIf there could be any well founded doubt as to the right or privilege of cross-examination contended for being excluded by the nature and purpose of the investigation in the light of the passage I have already quoted from section 10 and of the provisions of section 11 to which I have referred, subsection 4 of section 10, it seems to me, concludes the question. This reads as follows:\nDisclosure by any person other than the Attorney-General, his representative, or the registrar, without the consent of any one of them, of any information or evidence obtained or the name of any witness examined or sought to be examined under subsection (1) shall constitute an offence.\nLooking at this subsection in the light of the other provisions to which I have alluded, I find it quite impossible to avoid the conclusion, not only that the investigation provided for was not a judicial proceeding in any sense of the term but that it was intended to be conducted by the investigator in private and that no person or company should have the right of cross-examining any witness or witnesses brought before the investigator whether the evidence of such witness or witnesses should affect the status or reputation of such person or company or not. The case is one which does not fall within the principle stated in Bonanza Creek Hydraulic Concession v. The King[9] ; Smith v. The King[10] ; Wood v. Woad[11] ; Errington v. Minister of Health[12] , nor any of the other cases relied upon by the appellants. The appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDAVIS J.\u2014The Attorney-General of British Columbia, under section 10 of the Securities Frauds Prevention Act (c. 64 of the statutes of British Columbia, 1930) delegated his authority to the defendant Fraser, a solicitor of the city of Vancouver, to examine into the affairs of Wayside Consolidated Gold Mines Limited in order to ascertain whether any fraudulent act or any offence against the Act or the regulations had been or was about to be committed. Subsection (1) afforded the representative of the Attorney-General\nthe same power to summon and enforce the attendance of witnesses and compel them to give evidence on oath and to produce documents, records, and things as is vested in the Supreme Court or a Judge thereof for the trial of civil cases.\nIt may be observed in passing that the words of the section are \"may examine *** in order to ascertain.\" By subsection (2) when the Attorney-General or his representative is about to examine or is examining any person or company under this section, the Attorney-General may appoint an accountant or other expert to examine documents, properties, records and matters, and to report thereon. By subsection (3) the failure without reasonable excuse of any person summoned for examination to appear or his refusal to give evidence or to answer any question or to produce anything where the evidence, answer or production can be required under the section of the statute, is made an offence and shall also be prima facie evidence upon which\n(a) The Attorney-General or his representative may base an affirmative finding concerning any fraudulent act to which he may deem it relevant; or\n(b) The Supreme Court or a Judge thereof may grant an interim or permanent injunction; or\n(c) A magistrate may base a conviction for an offence against this Act or the regulations.\nThat the investigation is intended to be a secret investigation is made plain by subsection (4):\n(4) Disclosure by any person other than the Attorney-General, his representative, or the Registrar, without the consent of any one of them, of any information or evidence obtained or the name of any witness examined or sought to be examined under subsection (1) shall constitute an offence.\nBy section 11 of the statute,\n11. If the Attorney-General or his representative upon investigation finds that any fraudulent act, or that any offence against this Act or the regulations, has been, is being, or is about to be committed, the Attorney-General :\n(a) May, where a registered broker, company or salesman is in his opinion concerned therein, order that the broker, company, or salesman and any other registered broker, company or salesman connected with the same organization be suspended from registration for any period not exceeding ten days; or\n(b) May, where he considers a suspension for ten days inadequate, or where any unregistered person or company is in his opinion concerned in such fraudulent act or in such offence, proceed under the provisions of section 12, or otherwise under this Act or the regulations; and\n(c) May in any case give notice of the fraudulent act to the public by advertisement or otherwise, or to any individual by letter or otherwise, whenever he deems it advisable.\nDuring the course of the investigation by the defendant Fraser into the affairs of Wayside Consolidated Gold Mines Limited, it became apparent that the Vancouver Stock & Bond Company, Ltd., one of the plaintiffs in this action, had been an underwriter of the securities of the Wayside Company and the plaintiff St. John, who was a shareholder and the business manager of the underwriting company, was called upon and did give evidence. The investigation conducted by the defendant Fraser extended over several months, during which time a great deal of evidence was taken by him. His appointment was made on August 15, 1934, and proceeding thereunder continued until October 22, 1934, on which day the underwriting company, the Vancouver Stock & Bond Company, Ltd., and its business manager St. John, apprehending that the investigator Fraser might report to the Attorney-General adversely to them or either of them, issued a writ of summons in the Supreme Court of British Columbia against the investigator Fraser. The claim as endorsed upon the writ is as follows:\nThe plaintiffs' claim is for an injunction to restrain the defendant from proceeding further in connection with the investigation being held by him into the Wayside Consolidated Gold Mines, Limited, pursuant to the authority delegated to him by the Attorney-General under the provisions of the Securities Act; and to restrain him from making any finding or report to the Attorney-General in connection therewith in so far as the same, either directly or indirectly, relates to the conduct or action of the plaintiffs, or either of them.\nOn the day the writ was issued the learned Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of British Columbia granted an ex parte injunction against the defendant Fraser enjoining and restraining him from proceeding further in connection with the investigation being held by him into the affairs of the Wayside Consolidated Gold Mines, Ltd., pursuant to the authority delegated to him by the Attorney-General under the provisions of the statute,\nin so far as the same either directly or indirectly relates to the conduct or actions of the plaintiffs, or either of them, and from making any finding or report to the Attorney-General in connection therewith until judgment in this action, or until further order.\nLeave was granted to the defendant to apply to dissolve this injunction upon two days' notice to the plaintiffs.\nSubsequently, on October 26, 1934, the Attorney-General was, upon his own application and by order of the Court, added as a party defendant in the action. The plaintiffs did not amend their writ and no claim is made in the action against the Attorney-General. Then, on October 30, 1934, the learned Chief Justice who had granted the ex parte injunction dissolved the same on the application of the defendants, and all parties to the action having agreed to turn the motion into one for final judgment, the action was dismissed with costs. From this judgment the plaintiffs appealed to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia and on March 12, 1935, the appeal was dismissed, Mr. Justice Martin and Mr. Justice J. A. Macdonald dissenting[13] . Subsequently the plaintiffs applied for and were granted leave by the Court of Appeal to appeal to this Court.\nThe Attorney-General sought to take advantage of section 29 of the statute, which purports to bar actions and proceedings relating to investigations by the Attorney-General or his representative under the provisions of the statute. Section 29 reads as follows:\n29. No action whatever, and no proceedings by way of injunction, mandamus, prohibition, or other extraordinary remedy, shall lie or be instituted against any person, whether in his public or private capacity, or against any company in respect of any act or omission in connection with the administration or carrying out of the provisions of this Act or the regulations where such person is the Attorney-General or his representative, or the Registrar, or where such person or company was proceeding under the written or verbal direction or consent of any one of them, or under an order of the Supreme Court or a Judge thereof made under the provisions of this Act.\nThe validity of the statute was not attacked and there was no suggestion that the defendant Fraser was not properly authorized to make the investigation into the affairs of the Wayside Consolidated Gold Mines, Ltd., or that he was acting at any time beyond his jurisdiction except in the sense advanced by counsel for the appellants that he declined to permit counsel for the appellants before him to cross-examine at large all the witnesses whose evidence he had taken or might thereafter take. I cannot agree that this is a want of jurisdiction that takes the plaintiffs out of the rigour of the prohibitory section of the statute. Section 29 was obviously intended to prevent just such an action as this for an injunction to restrain the investigation from continuing, and the wisdom or fairess of such prohibitory legislation is not a matter with which we are concerned, for it is clearly within the competence of the legislature. While it is fundamental that a subject cannot without express words or necessary intendment be deprived of the protection of the Courts, the Courts must not interfere with competent legislation or attempt to so whittle away the obvious intention of the legislature as to destroy the effectiveness of its enactment. I do not find it necessary, however, to examine the precise scope of this section of the statute, preferring to deal with this appeal as if the action properly lay.\nAssuming then in favour of the appellants that the prohibitory section does not apply in this case, the real issue on the merits is whether or not the plaintiffs were entitled as of right to be afforded freedom of cross-examination of each and every witness called by the investigator. Counsel for the appellants says that such a right is founded upon what he terms \"natural justice,\" \"essential justice\" or \"British justice.\" Such phrases are rather loose and vague terms. The rights of the parties must be determined upon the basis of what they are entitled to according to law. A decision in accordance with the law is justice.\nLord Shaw of Dunfermline said in Local Government Board v. Arlidge[14] :\nIn so far as the term \"natural justice\" means that a result or process should be just it is a harmless though it may be a high-sounding expression; in so far as it attempts to reflect the old jus naturale it is a confused and unwarranted transfer into the ethical sphere of a term employed for other distinctions ***\nThe Attorney-General contends that the provisions of the statute were only intended to afford to him the right of an investigation into the facts, upon the report of which it became his duty as a member of the Executive to form his own opinion and to exercise such if any of the powers as are given to him by section 11 of the statute, and that if during the investigation every witness called was entitled to have his own counsel cross-examine all the other witnesses, the enquiry would become utterly ineffective, prolonged in duration and costly in administration. The Attorney-General stresses the secrecy provision of the statute, subsection (4) of section 10, as indicating in itself the very nature of the investigation.\nIt is not suggested by counsel for the appellants that the investigator is a court of law or even a tribunal having similar attributes to a court of law, but it is contended that the investigator is not a purely administrative body but what counsel calls \"a quasi-judicial tribunal.\" Broadly speaking, there are only two divisions\u2014judicial and administrative\u2014though within those two broad divisions there have been tribunals with certain features common to both which have given rise to a somewhat loose, perhaps almost unavoidable, terminology in an effort to again subdivide the two broad classes of tribunals. Fundamentally, the investigator in this case was an administrative officer, and the machinery set up by the statute was administrative for the purpose of enquiring as to whether or not fraudulent practices had been or were being carried on in connection with the sale of the securities of the Wayside Company. The investigation provisions of the statute dealing generally with the prevention of fraud by stock brokers were part and parcel of the administrative machinery for the attainment of the general purposes of the statute. The investigator was not a court of law nor was he a court in law, but to say that he was an administrative body, as distinct from a judicial tribunal, does not mean that persons appearing before him were not entitled to any rights. An administrative tribunal must act to a certain extent in a judicial manner, but that does not mean that it must act in every detail in its procedure the same as a court of law adjudicating upon a lis inter partes. It means that the tribunal, while exercising administrative functions, must act \"judicially\" in the sense that it must act fairly and impartially. In O'Connor v. Waldron[15] , Lord Atkin refers to cases where tribunals, such as a military court of enquiry or an investigation by an ecclesiastical commission, had attributes similar to those of a court of justice.\nOn the other hand (he continues) the fact that a tribunal may be exercising merely administrative functions though in so doing it must act judicially, is well established, and appears clearly from the Royal Aquarium case[16] .\nIn the Royal Aquarium case[17] \"judicial\" in relation to administrative bodies is used in the sense that they are bound to act fairly and impartially.\nIn this case the defendant Fraser has sworn in his affidavit filed on the plaintiffs' motion for an injunction, and it is in no way denied,\n4. That during the course of my said examination I gave the fullest opportunity to the plaintiffs and each of them to appear before me and state all such relevant facts and information as they might desire to advance or to give an explanation or explanations to me, either through the plaintiff St. John, or their counsel, as they or either of them might deem expedient. The said St. John was examined and gave evidence before me at length on the 22nd and 30th days of August and the 15th and 18th days of October, A.D. 1934, and his evidence given before me comprises some 953 folios of the official transcript.\n5. That I further permitted the solicitor and counsel for the plaintiffs to be present and take part in the examination of the plaintiff St. John and extended to the plaintiffs' counsel fullest opportunity for argument on his clients' behalf, which opportunity was taken full advantage of and argument was submitted by plaintiffs' counsel on their behalf to the extent of some 340 folios of the official transcript.\nMoreover, it is admitted that the plaintiff St. John was recalled at the conclusion of the hearing of the witnesses by the defendant Fraser and afforded full opportunity to give any explanation he desired to give. His counsel had been furnished with a copy of all the evidence that he had requested. The only objection taken by the appellants, and it was very strenuously and earnestly pressed upon us in a very able argument by their counsel Mr. Farris, was that it was against natural justice that the plaintiffs should have been denied the right they claim of cross-examining every witness who was heard by the investigator. The right was asserted as a right to which every witness against whom a finding might possibly be made was entitled. I do not think that any such right exists at common law. The investigation was primarily an administrative function under the statute, and while the investigator was bound to act judicially in the sense of being fair and impartial, that, it seems to me, is something quite different from the right asserted by the appellants of freedom of cross-examination of all the witnesses. It is natural, as Lord Shaw said in the Arlidge case[18] , that lawyers should favour lawyer-like methods but it is not for the judiciary to impose its own methods on administrative or executive officers.\nUndoubtedly in the early days of administrative tribunals the courts took the position that the procedure to be followed by these tribunals should be the same as that of a court of law. In 1889 Field J. in Parsons v. Lakenheath School Board[19] , said,\nThey have been entrusted with judicial duties, and should, I think, perform those duties in the ordinary judicial way.\nBut with the increasing number of statutes which delegated power to administrative bodies, we find Lord Loreburn in Board of Education v. Rice[20] saying:\nThey can obtain information in any way they think best, always giving a fair opportunity to those who are parties in the controversy for correcting or contradicting any relevant statement prejudicial to their view.\nIn the Arlidge case[21] , a majority of the Court of Appeal decided that because Arlidge, after three full opportunities to present his case, was not permitted to see the report which the inspector remitted to the department for its consideration, he had been deprived of natural justice. The House of Lords emphatically denied this proposition, holding in effect, to quote Lord Haldane at p. 132, \"What the procedure is to be in detail must depend on the nature of the tribunal.\" The Arlidge case[22] was followed by the Judicial Committee in Wilson v. Esquimalt and Nanaimo Ry.[23] , the judgment being delivered by the present Chief Justice of this Court.\nThe only claim in the action is for relief by way of an injunction against the investigator Fraser to restrain him from proceeding with his investigation. Apart altogether from the formidable objection to the action raised by the prohibitory section of the statute (section 29), I cannot accept the contention of the appellants of the existence of the right which they have asserted in the action. The appeal therefore should be dismissed with costs.\nDYSART J. ad hoc\u2014I agree in the result.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: Stuart Hugh Gilmour.\nSolicitors for the respondent: McCrossen, Campbell & Meredith.\n[1] (1935) 49 B.C.

A municipal authority, in the absence of an express right to the contrary, was not entitled to deprive him of the full enjoyment of such right. But in Ontario the Municipal Act, R.S.O. 1927, c. 233 (ss. 483, 484, 342, 344, and other sections, specifically referred to), and the Local Improvement Act, R.S.O. 1927, c. 235 (ss. 2, 20 (2) (d), 3 (2), specifically referred to), have created an interference with such common law rights. And where the sidewalks and curbs in question, on streets adjoining land now owned by appellant, had been constructed about 13 years ago under the provisions of the Local Improvement Act, it was held that appellant had no right to compel the respondent municipality to permit a change in the curb to afford appellant convenient access to the streets for the purpose to which appellant intended to use its land.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissing its appeal from the judgment of McEvoy J. dismissing its action.\nThe plaintiff corporation owns certain lots in the village of Swansea (the defendant municipality), the land comprising a parcel roughly 50 feet in width by 150 feet in depth running between Kennedy avenue and Runnymede road in said village. The land was purchased by plaintiff in or about the year 1931. Some years earlier the defendant municipality, in the course of its rights and duties, had constructed sidewalks and roadways, with curbs between, upon the said two streets. The plaintiff desired to use its said land to loop empty buses through, and submitted to defendant municipality proposals for overcoming the barrier to vehicular traffic created by the curbs and requested that the work be carried out either by itself or by defendant, and offered to pay the full cost and expense of the work. The plaintiff alleged that defendant refused to permit the curbs to be altered as suggested or in any other manner to give reasonable vehicular access from the highways to plaintiff\u2019s land, and also alleged discrimination by defendant in that defendant had granted vehicular access to every other landowner who applied for it. Plaintiff claimed a declaration that it was entitled to reasonable vehicular access, a mandatory order compelling defendant to take such measures as might be necessary to give plaintiff such access, an injunction restraining defendant from refusing such access, and damages for interference with plaintiff\u2019s vehicular access.\nIn its statement of defence the defendant municipality alleged, inter alia, that, at the time of constructing the sidewalks and curbs in question, it dealt with and constructed all approaches applied for in accordance with s. 3 (2) of the Local Improvement Act, R.S.O. 1927, c. 235, and that an approach to the said property from Runnymede road was applied for and constructed at that time. The defendant denied that the plaintiff was entitled to any of the remedies claimed, and pleaded the Local Improvement Act, R.S.O. 1927, c. 235, and amendments thereto, and the Municipal Act, R.S.O. 1927, c. 233, and amendments thereto, and more especially s. 344 of the said Municipal Act.\nBy the judgment now reported the plaintiff\u2019s appeal to this Court was dismissed with costs.\nI.S. Fairty K.C. for the appellant.\nJ.J. Addy for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by DAVIS, J.\u2014Stripped of several collateral issues developed in evidence and discussed throughout the trial, the real point of the case is the determination of the right asserted by the appellant, an owner of land adjoining a public street within a village in the Province of Ontario, to compel the municipality, respondent, to permit a change in the level of the sidewalk and curb in front of its land in order to afford it convenient access to the public street for the purpose to which it intends to use its land. The point is a narrow and rather difficult one. It seldom arises as a matter of practical importance, for it may be taken as admitted that municipal authorities in Ontario generally afford to owners of land adjoining public streets such changes in the sidewalks and curbs in front of their property as are reasonably necessary to meet the changing conditions and requirements of the particular owner and the use to which he intends to put his property. In this case, however, a strict right is asserted by the appellant (owner) and denied by the respondent (municipality) and the matter falls for careful reasoning and interpretation of the law upon the subject.\nThere is no difficulty upon the question of the right at common law of an owner of land adjoining a public highway. He is entitled to access to such highway at any point at which his land actually touches such highway for any kind of traffic which is necessary for the reasonable enjoyment of his premises and will not, as he proposes to conduct it, cause a substantial nuisance. Halsbury (Hailsham ed.), Vol. 16, p. 251. This is a right of property that was well settled at the common law. A private owner was always entitled to a full and uninterrupted access from his property that adjoined a public highway to that public highway and a municipal authority, in the absence of express statutory right to the contrary, was not entitled to deprive the private owner of the full enjoyment of this right. When he reaches the public highway and travels upon it, the private owner becomes then one of the public using the highway and subject to all the duties and obligations that rest upon the public generally, but it is his private right to be fully and freely permitted at all points of his private property to have freedom of access to the adjoining public highway. That principle of the common law has been fully and completely restated very recently by Lord Atkin in delivering the judgment of the House of Lords in Marshall v. Blackpool Corporation[1].\nThat leads us to an investigation and consideration of any statutory provisions in Ontario altering the common law in this respect. By the Municipal Act, R.S.O. 1927, ch. 233, \u201chighway\u201d means a common and public highway, and includes a street (sec. 1 (e)). By sec. 443, unless otherwise expressly provided, the soil and freehold of every highway shall be vested in the corporation or corporations of the municipality or municipalities, the council or councils of which for the time being have jurisdiction over it under the provisions of the Municipal Act or any other Act. And by sec. 444, except where jurisdiction over them is expressly conferred upon another council, the council of every municipality shall have jurisdiction over all highways within the municipality. By sec. 469, every highway shall be kept in repair by the corporation the council of which has jurisdiction over it, or upon which the duty of repairing it is imposed by the Act.\nThen by sec. 483, the council of every municipality may pass by-laws,\n(a) for establishing and laying out highways;\n(b) for widening, altering or diverting any highway or part of a highway;\n(c) for stopping up any highway or part of a highway and for leasing or selling the soil and freehold of a stopped up highway or part of a highway;\n(d) for setting apart and laying out such parts as may be deemed expedient of any highway for the purpose of carriage ways, boulevards and sidewalks, and for beautifying the same, and making regulations for their protection;\n(e) for permitting subways for cattle under and bridges for cattle over any highway;\n(f) for acquiring land or an interest in land at street intersections for the purpose of rounding corners.\nSec. 484 provides that a by-law shall not be passed for stopping up, altering or diverting any highway if the effect of the by-law will be to deprive any person of the means of ingress or egress to and from his land or place of residence over such highway or part of it unless in addition to making compensation for such person, as provided by this Act, another convenient road or way of access to his land or place of residence is provided. Sec. 486 provides for publication of notice of any by-law for the stopping up, altering, widening, diverting, selling or leasing of a highway or for establishing or laying out a highway. Other sections of the Municipal Act deal with various phases of matters incidental to the carrying out of the general powers of municipalities in connection with highways but the sections to which I have referred indicate generally the scope and extent of the powers of municipal councils over highways.\nThe Local Improvement Act, R.S.O. 1927, ch. 235, specifically provides by sec. 2 thereof for works of the following character or description which may be undertaken by the council of a municipal corporation as a local improvement, that is to say:\n(a) Opening, widening, extending, grading, altering the grade of, diverting or improving a street;\n(f) paving a street;\n(g) constructing a curbing or a sidewalk in, upon or along a street.\nThis section does not extend or apply to a work of ordinary repair or maintenance. The procedure for undertaking local improvement works is set out in this statute and provision is made as to how the cost of the work is to be borne. By sec. 20 (2) (d) there may be included in the cost of such work \u201ccompensation for lands taken for the purposes of the work or injuriously affected by it.\u201d By sec. 3 (2) of this Act,\nwhere the work is the construction of a pavement, the council may from time to time during the progress of the work, upon the written request of the owner of the lot to be served, provide for the construction, as part of the pavement, of an approach of such width and character as the council may determine, from the boundary line of the pavement to the street line, so as to form an approach to a particular lot, and the cost of such approach shall be specially assessed upon the particular lot so served.\nReverting to the Municipal Act, it is provided by sec. 342 thereof that\nwhere land is expropriated for the purposes of a corporation, or is injuriously affected by the exercise of any of the powers of a corporation under the authority of this Act or under the authority of any general or special Act, unless it is otherwise expressly provided by such general or special Act, the corporation shall make due compensation to the owner for the land expropriated and for any damage necessarily resulting from the expropriation of the land, or where land is injuriously affected by the exercise of such powers for the damages necessarily resulting therefrom, beyond any advantage which the owner may derive from any work, for the purposes of, or in connection with which the land is injuriously affected.\nThe amount of the compensation, if not mutually agreed upon, shall be determined by arbitration. By sec. 344,\nexcept where the person entitled to the compensation is an infant, a lunatic, or of unsound mind, a claim for compensation for damages resulting from his land being injuriously affected shall be made in writing, with particulars of the claim, within one year after the injury was sustained, or after it became known to such person, and, if not so made, the right to compensation shall be forever barred.\nIn this case it was proved that the existing sidewalks and curbs were constructed some thirteen or fifteen years ago by the respondent municipality under the provisions of the Local Improvement Act. The lands were in exactly the same condition as regards curbs and sidewalks when purchased by the appellant three or four years ago. It is admitted that it is not unlikely that the owner or owners of the land in question when the sidewalks and curbs were constructed were in fact petitioners under the Local Improvement Act for the work to be undertaken by the municipality. At any rate, it is plain that if their lands were then injuriously affected by the construction of the work, the then owners were entitled to compensation. It is not disclosed whether any such compensation was sought. But there was authority in the municipality by virtue of the express provisions of the Municipal Act and of the Local Improvement Act, to which I have referred, to construct the sidewalks and the curbs that are now complained of as preventing the full enjoyment of the property by the present owner in the use to which he intends to put the land. To this extent there is a statutory interference with the common law rights of owners of land adjoining a highway.\nWe were not referred to any statutory provisions in Ontario, and I know of none, setting up any procedure permitting a change by individual owners in the level of sidewalks or curbs constructed by the municipality under the Local Improvement Act. In the Blackpool Corporation case[2] the statute set up a procedure for every person desirous of forming a communication for horses or vehicles across any footpath so as to afford access to any premises from a street, to submit to the corporation a plan of the proposed communication, shewing where it will cut the foothpath, and what provision (if any) is made for curbing and for a paved crossing and the dimensions and gradients of the necessary works, and providing that after hav- ing obtained the sanction of the corporation such person may execute the works at his own expense under the supervision and to the satisfaction of the corporation and not otherwise.\nIn view of the statutory provisions in Ontario the appellant is not entitled to the right which it has asserted in this action and its appeal to this Court from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario which dismissed its appeal to that Court from the judgment at the trial which dismissed its action for a declaration of the right asserted must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Irving S. Fairty.\nSolicitor for the respondent: J.J. Addy.\n[1] [1935] A.C. 16.\n[2] [1935] A.C. 16.\n",

They were executed by respondent at its head office in Indianapolis, and provided for payment on the insured\u2019s death of a certain number of \u201cdollars\u201d \u201cat the Home Office of the Company, Indianapolis, Indiana.\u201d They provided that the premiums be paid \u201cat said Home Office or to an agent of the Company.\u201d All the premiums were paid in Canadian moneys. W. died on March 10, 1933. At the time the insurance became due and payable, there was a premium on United States money in terms of Canadian money; and appellants claimed that respondent was bound to pay the value of United States dollars to the number of dollars specified in the policies.\nHeld (Duff C.J. and Davis J. dissenting): Payment in Canadian dollars to the number of dollars specified in the policies, was sufficient to discharge respondent\u2019s obligation, Judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, [1934] O.R. 677, affirmed.\nPer Cannon J.: Any inference in favour of United States dollars that might be drawn from the naming of Indianapolis as a place of payment is rebuttable, and is rebutted in this case by (1) the provisions of The Ontario Insurance Act (R.S.O. 1914, c. 183, s. 155; R.S.O. 1927, c. 222, s. 159) and (2) the interpretation put upon the ambiguous contract by the acts of the parties.\nPer Crocket J. and Dysart J. (ad hoc): To assume that in entering into the contract the parties directed their attentions solely to the wording and meaning of the policies, and not in any degree to the provisions and effect of the insurance law of the Province, would do violence to the underlying facts and the background of the case. From the circumstances, it might be assumed that the parties realized they were making a contract in Ontario and subject to the laws of Ontario. While it is well settled law that contracts which are to be performed by payment of money in a designated place or country require that payment shall be made in the legal tender or currency of the place set for payment, yet this is only a prima facie rule or presumption, and is rebuttable (Adelaide Electric Supply Co. Ltd. v. Prudential Assurance Co. Ltd., [1934] A.C. 122, at 151, 152, 155); and the presumption is rebutted in this case by the statute law of the Province relating to payment of the insurance money (The Ontario Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1914, c. 183, s. 155; not changed in substance, as affecting said policies, by R.S.O. 1927, c. 222); by the provisions of the policies relating to the payment of premiums; and by the conduct of the parties (in making and accepting payment of premiums throughout in Canadian currency). (Discussion as to the distinction of this case from others in that the term \u201cdollars\u201d is common both to Canada and the United States and represents a unit or denomination of currency of practically the same value when the dollar is accepted at par in the two countries; and as to the use in the policies of the term \u201cdollars\u201d without any epithet or other qualification; reference to the Adelaide case, supra, at 152, 155, 148).\nPer Duff C.J. and Davis J. (dissenting): A contract to pay in a unit of currency prima facie means currency according to the meaning of the unit at the place where payment is called for by the contract (the Adelaide case, supra, at 156). The currency of the place of payment, i.e., Indianapolis, was the currency intended by the contract to govern the payment of the \u201cdollars\u201d stipulated to be paid. On the construction of the contract alone there was no ambiguity\u2014payment was due in United States dollars. The intention of The Ontario In- surance Act (R.S.O. 1914, c. 183, s. 155, in force when the contracts were made; not changed in substance, so far as payment is concerned, by R.S.O. 1927, c. 222, in force when the policies matured), was not to fix the amount to be paid as something different from the amount settled by the contract between the parties, but merely to determine the manner in which the amount already fixed by the parties was to be discharged; to make payable within Ontario in lawful money of Canada whatever was the agreed amount of insurance. The amount of insurance to be paid was the value, in lawful money of Canada, of United States dollars to the number of dollars specified in the policies.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiffs from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] allowing the defendant\u2019s appeal from the judgment of McEvoy J.[2] in favour of the plaintiffs.\nThe dispute was with regard to the amount payable by the defendant insurance company, in Canadian money, on two life insurance policies. The defendant had paid the face amount of the policies, $17,400, in Canadian funds. The plaintiffs claimed that the payment should have included the further sum of $3,632.25, as being premium, at the rate of 20\u215e per cent. as of April 6, 1933, by which the value in Canadian money of said sum of $17,400 in United States money exceeded the said sum in Canadian money.\nThe determination of the question came before McEvoy J. upon a motion for judgment under Ontario Consolidated Rule 222, on facts stated and admitted in the pleadings.\nThe admitted facts included the following:\nThe defendant is a foreign life insurance corporation organized under and in accordance with the laws of the State of Indiana, one of the United States of America, with its head office, or Home Office, in the city of Indianapolis in said State. Defendant is, and during the whole currency of the policies in question has been, under the laws from time to time in force, as fully entitled to transact the business of life insurance in Ontario as any domestic insurance company. On August 9, 1917, it issued two insurance policies (being those in question) on the life of Barnett Weiss, who resided in the city of Toronto, in the Province of Ontario, and the policies were delivered to Weiss in the said city of Toronto. By each of the policies the defendant agreed to pay \u201ca monthly income of Fifty Dollars per month\u201d to Yetta Weiss, wife of the insured, for 240 successive months, and for so many months thereafter as she should live, \u201cat the Home Office of the Company, Indianapolis, Indiana,\u201d the first monthly payment to be made immediately upon receipt at such Home Office of due proof of the death of the insured, during the continuance of the policy, and of the interest of the claimant. It was agreed that the insured reserved the right to change the method of payments of the policy as a death claim without the consent of any beneficiary, by filing at the Home Office of the Company a written request therefor, accompanied by the policy for endorsement. By a letter signed by the insured dated 30th October, 1917, he directed that Yetta Weiss, the beneficiary named, \u201cshall at the time of my death have the option of accepting the commuted value stipulated in said policies in lieu of the monthly income payments, provided for in said policies\u201d; and there was a signed endorsement on each of the policies dated November 22, 1917, to the effect that in accordance with said direction the said beneficiary at the time of the insured\u2019s death should have the option \u201cof accepting the commuted value of this policy in lieu of the monthly income payments provided for in the policy.\u201d\nEach of the policies provided:\n(e) This contract is made in consideration of the application therefor, which is made a part hereof, and a copy of which is hereto attached, and in further consideration of the sum of Three Hundred Ninety-three & 90\/100 Dollars, to be paid in advance to the Company on or before the delivery of this Policy, and of the payment of a like sum on or before the Ninth day of August in each year during the continuance of this contract.\n(f) All premiums are payable in advance at said Home Office, or to an agent of the Company, upon delivery of the receipt therefor signed by the President or Secretary of the Company, and countersigned by the said agent.\n(g) Canadian Residents. Should this policy be issued in favour of a resident of Canada, any action to enforce the obligations of the same may be validly taken in any court of competent jurisdiction in the Province where the policyholder resides, or last resided prior to his decease.\nAttached to each policy was a photostatic copy of an application signed by Barnett Weiss and dated at Toronto, Ontario, on the 24th day of July, 1917, and in the policies the following statement appeared: In witness Whereof the State Life Insurance Company has caused this policy to be signed by its President and Secretary at its Home Office in the City of Indianapolis, this 9th day of August, 1917.\nAll of the premiums paid by the insured were paid in Canadian funds.\nThe insured, the said Barnett Weiss, died at the said city of Toronto on March 10, 1933.\nThe said Yetta Weiss, after the death of the insured, elected to accept the commuted value of the policies. The commuted value of each policy was $8,700, totalling for the two policies $17,400.\nSome years prior to the death of the insured the defendant for convenience in handling its Canadian business had opened a bank account with the Canadian Bank Commerce at Toronto and defendant had continuously kept the said account.\nThe plaintiffs claimed that the payment under the policies should be in United States funds, which were, at the time the insurance moneys became due and payable, at a premium over Canadian funds. It was agreed that the cheque sent by the defendant for $17,400, which was payable at the Canadian Bank of Commerce, Toronto, might be cashed, without prejudice to the right to demand and recover the additional amount claimed.\nYetta Weiss aforesaid and Morris Weiss, as executrix and executor of the estate of Barnett Weiss, deceased, joined with Yetta Weiss, in bringing the action, for the purpose of endorsing her claim as beneficiary under the policies.\nBy the judgment now reported, the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal to this Court was dismissed with costs, Duff C.J. and Davis J. dissenting.\nR.S. Robertson K.C. and R.M. Fowler for the appellants.\nA.W. Anglin K.C. for the respondent.\nCANNON, J.\u2014I agree with Mr. Justice Masten in the court below that any inference in favour of American dollars that might be drawn from the naming of Indianapolis as a place of payment is rebuttable and is, in fact, rebutted in this case, first, by the provisions of the Ontario Insurance Acts in force during the life of and at the date of maturity of the policies, and, secondly, by the interpretation which has been put upon the ambiguous contract by the acts of the parties.\nThis appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Crocket J. and Dysart J. ad hoc was delivered by\nDYSART, J. (ad hoc)\u2014With the greatest deference to the members of this Court who take a contrary view, it seems to me that the result arrived at by the Court of Appeal of Ontario is correct and that this appeal ought to be dismissed.\nThe single point for determination here is whether the policies in question are payable in United States dollars or in Canadian dollars. The practical importance of the question is, that because of the conditions of money exchange on the date on which payment should have been made, United States dollars were at a premium in Ontario, and were worth more in Ontario than a corresponding number of Canadian dollars.\nIf it be assumed, as I think it should not, that in entering into this contract, the parties directed their attentions solely to the wording and meaning of the policies, and not in any degree to the provisions and effect of the insurance law of the Province, it might be that they contemplated payment in United States dollars. To make such an assumption in this case would, I think, do violence to the underlying facts and the background of the case.\nIn 1917, when the policies in question were issued, the Insurance Company was registered in Ontario, had offices and agents there with sufficient authority to transact all things necessary or incidental to the business of securing applications for insurance, of delivering policies, and of collecting premiums. At that time, and subsequently, the insured was a resident of the Province. It may, therefore, be assumed that both contracting parties realized that they were making a contract in Ontario and subject to the laws of Ontario; and that if they adverted at all to the meaning of the term \u201cdollars\u201d as used in the policies, they intended to comply with the laws of the Province in that regard. The Insurance Company in par- ticular should be assumed to have been fully informed of the law governing the issue and discharge of insurance policies in the Province.\nThe statutory law of the Province in force in 1917 was The Ontario Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1914, ch. 183, which provided in section 155 (1), so far as here relevant, that a policy delivered in the Province to a resident therein,\nshall be deemed to evidence a contract made therein, and the contract shall be construed according to the law thereof, and all moneys payable under the contract shall be paid at the office of the chief officer or agent in Ontario of the insuring corporation in lawful money of Canada.\nAnd, (2)\nThis section shall have effect notwithstanding any agreement, condition or stipulation to the contrary.\nBy section 154\nExcept where otherwise provided sections 155 to 158 shall apply to every contract of insurance.\nOf these four sections, section 155 is alone relevant to the issues of this case.\nWhen the policies matured in 1933, the Act had changed in form, but, so far as affects the policies, not in substance; R.S.O. 1927, c. 222, ss. 121-159 still required the insurance moneys to be paid in the Province \u201cin lawful money of Canada.\u201d\nThe policies themselves were executed by the Insurance Company at its head office (called Home Office) in Indianapolis, and provided for payment on the death of the insured of \u201c * * * Dollars * * * at the Home Office of the Company, Indianapolis, Indiana.\u201d The sums so payable consisted of a series of instalments which were subsequently by arrangement of the parties changed to a lump sum of 17,400 \u201cdollars.\u201d\nIt is well settled law that contracts which are to be performed by payment of money in a designated place or country require that payment shall be made in the legal tender or currency of the place set for payment. But this is only a prima facie rule or presumption, and of course is rebuttable: Adelaide Electric Supply Co. Ltd. v. Prudential Assurance Co. Ltd.[3] It seems to me that the presumption is rebutted in this case by the statute law of the Province relating to payment of the insurance money; by the provisions of the policy relating to the payment of premiums; and by the conduct of parties\u2014of the insured in paying, and of the insurer in accepting payment, of premiums in Canadian currency throughout the whole period. (1) The statutory law relating to the point I have already set out, namely, that \u201call moneys payable under the contract shall be paid * * * in Ontario * * * in lawful money of Canada.\u201d Standing by itself this provision means that all moneys\u2014both premiums and insurance moneys\u2014shall be paid in Canadian currency. (2) The provisions respecting the payment of premiums as set out in the policy are that they be paid \u201cat said Home Office or to an agent of the Company.\u201d This means that the premiums might be paid to an agent in Ontario, in other words, in Canadian currency. And if the premiums were payable in Canadian currency, then the insurance money should be payable in the same currency because, as is well known, insurance business is conducted on a basis of, inter alia, a definite relationship or ratio between the amount of the premiums and the amount of the insurance. To disregard this relationship or to assume that the Insurance Company meant to pay the insurance moneys in United States dollars irrespective of the currency in which the premiums were paid, is, I think, to attribute to the contracting parties something that they would probably not have agreed to if their attention had been called to it. (3) The premiums throughout the whole currency of the policies were paid in Ontario in Canadian currency. The conduct of the parties on this point is entitled to some weight as to the meaning of the contract, or at least as to their intentions respecting the medium of payment.\nThe contracts, however, should be construed upon broad grounds. To say that the parties in making the contract directed their attention only to the written document, and entirely ignored the existence of Provincial statutory law, is hardly consistent with the probabilities; and is surely inconsistent with what the law imputes to them. Apart from the statute, the policy was on its face made in the United States, was issued from the \u201cHome Office,\u201d all premiums were to be made there, or to an agent who might be in the United States, and the insurance moneys were eventually to be paid there in United States currency. Notwithstanding those express terms, the contract is deemed to be an Ontario contract, performable at least in part in Ontario; and this, by virtue of the force of the Insurance Act of Ontario. In other words, the Act has varied some of the express provisions of the contract, or has substituted its own provisions for others. If the Act can go that far, why may it not go further and substitute also the provisions respecting the currency in which the insurance moneys are to be paid?\nThe confusion or difficulty in this case arises from the fact that the term \u201cdollars\u201d is common both to Canada and the United States, and represents a unit or denomination of currency of practically the same value when the dollar is accepted at par in the two countries. This fact distinguishes this case from others in which the amount of insurance to be paid in a foreign country is stated in denominations of currency of that country not in use in Canada. In such cases, there is no difficulty. The contract in those cases is to be discharged in foreign currency, converted into Canadian currency at the prevailing rates of exchange. If in this case the policy had been payable in \u201cUnited States dollars,\u201d there would have been no difficulty. But the term \u201cdollar\u201d used without any epithet or other qualification leaves us uncertain as to whether United States \u201cdollars\u201d or Canadian \u201cdollars\u201d is meant. As Lord Wright said in Adelaide Electric Supply Co. Ltd.[4] supra, at page 152,\nwhere the same denomination is used in the two countries, the result may be that the sum in figures is to be construed as meaning that number of the common unit of account, \u201cpounds\u201d according to its meaning in the currency law of the country where payment is to be made. Thus it will be a question of construction in the absence of express terms whether the word \u201cpound\u201d means what may compendiously be described as an English pound or a Colonial pound.\nAnd again at p. 155:\nWhere the denominations of the currency are different, as in the case of the Spanish pesetas[5], it is clear that an exchange operation is necessarily involved. But where the denomination of the unit of account is identical in the two currencies, though the measure of value which is expressed by the unit of account is different, the question is not so concluded. Lord Russell at page 148 of the same case introduces another factor in construction when he says:\nIt is not a question what amount of coins or other currency has the debtor contracted to pay. A debt is not incurred in terms of currency, but in terms of units of account. It is a question of discharging a debt incurred in terms of units of account common to more than one country, in the currency which is legal tender in the particular country in which the debt has to be paid.\nThis language of Lord Russell\u2019s is helpful also as suggesting that the intention of the contracting parties here may have been directed to the number of \u201cdollars\u201d to be paid under the policies rather than the currency in which those dollars were to be found.\nReverting again to section 155 (1) above quoted in part, and bearing in mind that \u201cthe contract shall be construed according to the law of Ontario,\u201d it may be said that the law of Ontario is that the currency to be used in paying the insurance moneys is the currency of the place of payment, that is the United States. While this is true, it is also the law of Ontario, that the payment in this case was presumably to be made in United States dollars, and that the presumption is rebuttable, as I have above indicated.\nI desire to be understood as confining my remarks in this judgment to the circumstances and the policies in this case.\nFor these reasons, most of which were expressed by the learned judges of the Court of Appeal, I think the payment of these policies should be made in Canadian dollars to the number specified in the policies. As payment in fact has been so made, without prejudice to this appeal, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Duff C.J. and Davis J. (dissenting) was delivered by\nDAVIS, J.\u2014There are no facts in dispute in this action but the facts raise a narrow and difficult question of law. The parties agreed to have the action determined upon a motion for judgment on the pleadings under Consolidated Rule 222 of the Ontario Rules of Practice.\nThe question of law is whether or not the respondent, a life insurance company with head office in the city of Indianapolis in the United States of America, was bound to pay upon the death of the insured Weiss the proceeds of the life insurance calculated in terms of the value of Canadian or of American dollars. At the time the insurance moneys became due and payable there was a premium of 20\u215e per cent. on American money in terms of Canadian money. The company paid the full face value of the two policies on the life of the insured to the widow of the deceased, as sole designated beneficiary thereof, in Canadian dollars without prejudice to the question of exchange, it being asserted by the widow that the company was bound to pay in terms of the value of American dollars. This action was brought by the widow and the legal representatives of the deceased insured against the company to recover $3,632.25 (with interest) being the amount of the exchange. Mr. Justice J.A. McEvoy, who heard the motion for judgment in the action, decided in favour of the plaintiffs for that sum. Upon appeal, the Court of Appeal for Ontario set aside that judgment and ordered that the action be dismissed. The plaintiffs now appeal to this Court.\nThe insured was Barnett Weiss, a business man resident in the city of Toronto who died on March 10, 1933. The appellants are his widow and the executors of his will. The respondent, the State Life Insurance Company, is a foreign life insurance company organized under and in accordance with the laws of the State of Indiana, one of the United States of America, with head office (referred to by the company as its \u201cHome Office\u201d) in the city of Indianapolis in the said State. The respondent has at all material times been duly registered in the Province of Ontario as a life insurance company entitled to transact the business of life insurance within the province.\nOn or about August 9, 1917, the respondent issued two insurance policies on the life of the late Barnett Weiss and delivered the policies to him in Toronto. By the terms of the said policies, identical in form, the respondent insured the life of the said Weiss and agreed upon his death to pay a monthly income of $50 to his wife during 240 successive months and for so many months thereafter as she should live. The policies were attested in the following words:\nIn witness Whereof the State Life Insurance Company has caused this policy to be signed by its President and Secretary at its Home Office in the City of Indianapolis, this 9th day of August, 1917.\nAttached to each policy is a photostatic copy of a letter to the respondent signed by the insured at Toronto the 30th day of October, 1917, directing, pursuant to certain provisions of the policies, that his wife as the beneficiary named in the policies shall at the time of his death have the option of accepting the commuted value stipulated in the said policies in lieu of the monthly income payments. And typewritten upon the back of each of the policies appears an endorsement, dated November 22, 1917, signed by the Vice-President of the company stating that\nIn accordance with the written direction of the insured, dated October 30th, 1917, the beneficiary Yetta Weiss, at the time of the death of the insured shall have the option of accepting the commuted value of this policy in lieu of the monthly income payments provided for in the policy.\nIt is admitted that proper and sufficient proofs of loss were completed and forwarded by the appellants to the respondent at its home office in Indianapolis and that the appellant Yetta Weiss, the widow of the insured and the sole beneficiary of the policies, elected to accept the commuted value of the policies pursuant to the endorsement upon the policies. A cheque of the respondent for the commuted value of the policies, $17,400, payable at the Canadian Bank of Commerce, Toronto, was delivered by the respondent to the appellants by letter, dated April 6, 1933, sent by the respondent from its home office at Indianapolis. The appellants claimed that the payment under the two policies in question should have been the equivalent in Canadian money of the commuted value of the policies in American money. By arrangement between the parties, the appellants became entitled to cash the cheque without prejudice to the question of exchange. On April 6, 1933, the premium on American moneys is admitted by the parties to have been 20\u215e per cent. Yetta Weiss, the widow of the insured and the sole named beneficiary under the policies, commenced this action on October 23, 1933, to recover the amount of the premium. The executors of the last will of the deceased joined in the action for the purpose of endorsing the claim of Yetta Weiss as beneficiary under the policies. The policies in question contained, amongst others, the following clause:\nCanadian Residents. Should this policy be issued in favour of a resident of Canada, any action to enforce the obligations of the same may be validly taken in any court of competent jurisdiction in the Province where the policyholder resides, or last resided prior to his decease.\nThe action against the company was brought in the Province of Ontario.\nIt is admitted that all the premiums paid by the insured on the said policies were paid in Canadian moneys and that for some years prior to the death of the insured the company for convenience in handling its Canadian business opened a bank account with the Canadian Bank of Commerce at Toronto and that the company has continuously kept the said account from the date of its opening to the present time. No particulars are given as to either the payment or receipt of the premiums from time to time and, apart from the admission that the company was fully entitled to transact the business of life insurance in Ontario, there is nothing to shew the extent to which this power was actually exercised.\nThe policies expressly state that the company agrees to pay \u201c * * * dollars at the Home Office of the Company, Indianapolis, Indiana.\u201d Upon those words of the policies the appellants assert the right to be paid on the basis of the value of American money. With the greatest deference to those of the court below who have expressed the opinion that the language is ambiguous, I cannot see any ambiguity. In the very recent case of Adelaide Electric Supply Co. Ltd. v. Prudential Assurance Co. Ltd.[6], it was clearly stated in the House of Lords that a contract to pay in a unit of currency prima facie means currency according to the meaning of the unit at the place where payment is called for by the contract. At p. 156 Lord Wright says,\nThe old cases I have cited show, as I think, that in determining what currency is intended, the general rule prima facie applies that the law of the place of performance is to govern. As Lord Eldon said in Cash v. Kennion[7], the debtor is bound to have the money ready at the appointed time and place of payment. It is natural and reasonable that the money he should be bound to have ready should be the legal money of that place, rather than that he should have a foreign currency or should have an amount in his home currency which is not the agreed figure, but a different figure representing an exchange operation by which the agreed figure is converted (in this case) from sterling to currency. Similarly, if a Frenchman and a Belgian were to agree that francs were to be paid by one to the other in Brussels, it would naturally be inferred in the absence of express terms that the Belgian franc was intended.\nThe currency of the place of payment, i.e., Indianapolis, was the currency intended by the contract to govern the payment of the \u201cdollars\u201d stipulated to be paid If the contract stood alone I should have no doubt that payment was due in American dollars.\nThe difficulty, however, is that the provisions of the Ontario Insurance Act, both at the date of the issue of the policies and at the date of the death (for it is not contended that there is any substantial difference in the language of the statute at the two dates) are urged upon us as governing these policies.\nIf the provisions of the Ontario Insurance Act apply to the policies in question and to the payment of the proceeds thereof, and it is not in dispute that they do, it seems plain that payment is to be made \u201cin lawful money of Canada\u201d notwithstanding any agreement in the contracts to the contrary.\nIt is admitted that the company\nduring the whole currency of the insurance policies * * * has been, under the laws from time to time in force, as fully entitled to transact the business of life insurance in Ontario as any domestic insurance company. (Par. 2 of the statement of claim)\nand that the policies\nwere delivered to the insured, Barnett Weiss, in the City of Toronto, County of York, in the Province of Ontario. (Par. 3 of the statement of claim).\nThe provisions of the Ontario Insurance Act, R.S.O.1927, ch. 222, in operation at the date of the maturity of the policies, relevant to the present case, appear in Part V dealing with \u201cLife Insurance.\u201d\nSec. 119 (2) \u201cContract\u201d or \u201ccontract of insurance\u201d means a contract of life insurance;\n(10) \u201cInsurance money\u201d includes all insurance money, benefits, surplus, profits, dividends, bonuses and annuities payable by an insurer under a contract of insurance;\nSec. 120 (2) Unless hereinafter otherwise specifically provided, this Part shall apply to the unmatured obligations of every contract of life insurance made in the Province before the coming into force of this Part.\nSec. 121 A contract is deemed to be made in the Province,\n(a) If the place of residence of the insured is stated in the application or the policy to be in the Province; or,\n(b) If neither the application nor the policy contains a statement as to the place of residence of the insured, but the actual place of residence of the insured is within the Province at the time of the making of the contract.\nSec. 159 (1) Insurance money which is expressed to be payable at the maturity of the contract shall be payable thirty days after reasonably sufficient proof has been furnished to the insurer of the maturity of the contract, of the age of the person whose life is insured, and of the right of the claimant to receive payment.\n(2) Insurance money shall be payable in the Province in lawful money of Canada.\nThe above provisions came into force on January 1st, 1925, and while made applicable to the unmatured obligations of every contract of life insurance made in the Province of Ontario before their coming into force, it is convenient to refer to the relevant provisions of the Ontario Insurance Act in force at the time the contracts were made. Such provisions are found in the Revised Statutes of Ontario, 1914, ch. 183:\nSec. 155 (1) Where the subject-matter of a contract of insurance is property or an insurable interest in property within Ontario, or is a person domiciled or resident therein, the contract of insurance, if signed, countersigned, issued or delivered in Ontario or committed to the post office or to any carrier, messenger or agent to be delivered or handed over to the assured, his assign or agent in Ontario, shall be deemed to evidence a contract made therein, and the contract shall be construed according to the law thereof, and all moneys payable under the contract shall be paid at the office of the chief officer or agent in Ontario of the insuring corporation in lawful money of Canada.\n(2) This section shall have effect notwithstanding any agreement, condition or stipulation to the contrary.\nThis section was introduced into Ontario by 60 Vict. (1897), ch. 36, sec. 143, amending 56 Vict. (1893), ch. 32, sec. 10.\nIt will be seen that no useful argument is available as to whether the statutory provisions in force at the date of the issue of the policies or at the date of the maturity of the policies should govern, because, so far as payment is concerned, the words of the two statutes are substantially the same.\nThe Court of Appeal for Ontario unanimously decided that the payment of the commuted value of the policies in Canadian dollars was a complete satisfaction of the obligation of the company, having regard to the statutory provisions, and dismissed the action. The appellants in their appeal before us argued that these provisions of the Ontario Insurance Act mean that the agreed amount of insurance, whatever it be according to the contract, is to be paid \u201cin the Province of Ontario\u201d and \u201cin lawful money of Canada,\u201d but that the statute has not the effect of changing the agreed amount of the insurance. The argument is that if the amount of money contracted for in the policies is 17,400 dollars payable at Indianapolis then the value of that sum is to be paid, by reason of the statute, in Ontario in lawful money of Canada, and that this necessarily involves an exchange transaction at the rate of exchange on the day when payment is due.\nIf there had been no such statutory enactment in Ontario the respondent would have been required to pay the beneficiary at its home office in Indianapolis $17,400 in American currency. That must be the plain effect of the words of the contract. Then, applying the statutory provisions, no difficulty arises as to the place of payment, for it is plain that the company must pay the beneficiary \u201cin Ontario,\u201d but the problem is, do the words of the statute \u201cin lawful money of Canada,\u201d involve payment of the stipulated number of dollars in Canadian currency or payment in lawful money of Canada of what is at the proper time the equivalent in Canadian currency of the value of the debt in terms of the contract between the parties? The difficulty arises because the word \u201cdollar\u201d has been used in both Canada and the United States to denote a measure of value expressed in the currencies of those countries. Supposing the policy had been issued by an English company, licensed to do business in Ontario, and delivered within Ontario to the insured, a resident of Ontario, and had provided for payment at maturity of \u201ca thousand pounds at the head office of the company in London, England,\u201d what would the effect of the statutory provision in Ontario be upon that policy? Counsel for the respondent frankly admits that in that case the beneficiary would be entitled to payment in Canadian money of such a sum as represents the value in English currency of the nominal amount of the policy at the prevailing rate of exchange. But the contracted debt, in this case, being in \u201cdollars,\u201d counsel for the respondent argues that the prima facie presumption of American dollars arising out of the stated place of payment in the policy, Indianapolis, is dislodged by the statute operating upon the contract and substituting Ontario as the place of payment instead of Indianapolis. That is the crucial point of the case and it depends upon what the effect of the statute is. Did the legislature have in mind that it would interfere with the contract that the parties had made and change the amount which the parties had agreed upon, or, was the legislature accepting the amount fixed by the contract to be paid and merely providing the manner in which the amount so fixed was to be discharged? It is difficult to attribute to the legislature an intention of intervening between the parties to the contract to protect the insured against any depreciation of foreign currency. It appears more reasonable to attribute to the legislature the intention of bringing the insuring corporation within the jurisdiction of the province by requiring it to have a registered agent upon whom process could be made and of providing the method in which a debt of fixed amount is to be discharged. We are all aware of the difficulties that presented themselves to beneficiaries in the different provinces in Canada in enforcing claims against foreign companies in the courts of their own province because of the absence of any agent of the companies upon whom process could be served, and it seems to me that the real object and intention of the legislature of Ontario when in 1897 it first introduced the provision that\nall moneys payable under the contract shall be paid at the office of the chief officer or agent in Ontario of the insuring corporation, in lawful money of Canada, and this section shall have effect notwithstanding any agreement, condition or stipulation to the contrary\nwas to overcome the difficulties in enforcing payment in Ontario against foreign insuring companies. If that was the object and intention of the legislature, there was no intention to fix the amount to be paid as something different from the amount settled by the contract between the parties but merely to determine the manner in which the amount already fixed by the parties was to be discharged.\nThe question is by no means free from doubt. One can quite understand another view being taken. But upon the whole I think that the statute only intended to make payable within Ontario in lawful money of Canada whatever was the agreed amount of insurance. When the parties agreed by their contract that there should be so many thousand dollars payable at the home office of the insuring company in Indianapolis, prima facie that meant American dollars, being the currency of the place of payment agreed upon. To dislodge that prima facie presumption, something more, it seems to me, is necessary than a statutory provision directed toward bringing the insuring corporation within reach of the beneficiary so that it might be sued within the province in which the insured resided and in which the policy was delivered. And to enter suit in the courts of the province it was convenient, if not necessary, to provide that the obligation under the contract should be payable in lawful money of Canada. That interpretation of the statute does not destroy the contract made between the parties as to the amount of insurance to be paid. It would require very clear and precise language to lead to an interpretation which would have the effect of destroying the contract between the parties in so far as the extent of the obligation is concerned.\nI would therefore allow the appeal and restore the decision on the motion for judgment on the pleadings, with costs throughout.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: McMaster, Montgomery, Fleury & Co.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Hunter & Hunter.\n[1] [1934] O.R. 677; [1934] 4 D.L.R. 469.\n[2] [1934] O.R. 677, at 677-679.\n[3] [1934] A.C. 122, at 151, 152 and 155\n[4] [1934] A.C. 122.\n[5] Ralli Brothers v.

The will in question in this case devised and bequeathed \"all my real and personal estate of which I may die possessed,\" and, after giving certain specific legacies, contained the following clause: \"The balance of my property to be divided between my ten children (naming them), and so that the said Joseph P. Hauck shall receive one thousand dollars less than the shares coming to the other chil- dren named, in consideration of advances previously made to him by me, and with this exception no account shall be taken or had of advances heretofore made by me to any of my children.\" Four of the sons were indebted to the estate on promissory notes given by them individually to the testator. Joseph P. had received $1,000 from his father in connection with some partnership transaction in land which they had entered into together. Other than the above-mentioned transactions with the five sons, the only advances were wedding presents of not over $100 each to the four daughters.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Appellate Division ([1934] 3 W.W.R. 335), that the debts represented by the notes were discharged by reason of the words in the will \"and with this exception no account shall be taken or had of advances heretofore made by me to any of my children.\" According to the intention of the testator, ascertained by a fair construction of the will and under the circumstances of the case, the words being given their usual and ordinary meaning, the moneys covered by the notes ought to be treated as no longer owing.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], reversing the judgment of the trial judge, Ewing J. and dismissing the appellants' action, upon an issue directed by Simmons C.J. as to the construction of the will of the father of the parties in this case, the question being the alleged release by the testator of certain debts represented by promissory notes owing to him by some of his son's at the date of his death.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nR. D. Tighe K.C. for the appellants.\nH. J. Macdonald for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nLAMONT J.\u2014This is an appeal by the plaintiffs from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta(1) which reversed (Lunney and McGillivray JJ. A. dissenting) the judgment of Ewing J. in favour of the plaintiffs.\nThe question in the appeal is as to the proper construction of the will of Engelbert Hauck which, after making provision for a couple of small bequests, reads as follows:\u2014 I give, devise and bequeath all my real and personal estate of which I may die possessed in the following manner, that is to say:\nTwenty-five hundred (2500) dollars and my household furniture and effects (if still undisposed of at the time of my decease) to my beloved wife, Annie Hauck, free from succession duty;\nThe balance of my property to be divided between my ten children, Joseph P. Hauck, Josephine Schmaltz, Albin Hauck, Annie Waechter, Tillie Heidmiller, Mary Heisler, Philip A. Hauck, Henry Hauck, Clarence Hauck and Edwin Hauck, and so that the said Joseph P. Hauck shall receive one thousand dollars less than the shares coming to the other children named, in consideration of advances previously made to him by me and with this exception no account shall be taken or had of advances heretofore made by me to any of my children.\nAnd I nominate and appoint Philip A. Hauck, Henry Hauck and Clarence Hauck to be executors of this my last will and testament. * * *.\nThe will was made on the 29th day of October, 1930, and Engelbert Hauck died on the 15th day of June, 1931, at Heisler, Alberta. He left him surviving his widow, Annie Hauck, and ten children\u2014six sons and four daughters. At the date of the will the daughters were all married.\nUpon the application of Joseph P. Hauck, Josephine Schmaltz, Annie Waechter and Mary Heisler, all beneficiaries under the will, and it appearing that four of the sons, namely, Philip, Clarence, Henry and Albin, had made certain promissory notes in favour of Engelbert Hauck, deceased, for moneys advanced, which notes the respective makers thereof claimed had been discharged and satisfied by the provision of the will, an issue was directed wherein Philip, Clarence, Henry and Albin were directed to be plaintiffs; and Matilda Heidmiller, Joseph P. Hauck, Josephine Schmaltz, Annie Waechter and Mary Heisler were directed to be defendants, and the question to be tried was:\u2014\nThe plaintiffs affirm and the defendants deny that the plaintiffs, and each of them, were and are fully discharged and released from any and all liability in respect of the promissory notes given by the plaintiffs respectively to Engelbert Hauck.\nThe promissory notes referred to were the following:\u2014\nPromissory note for $5,000 dated November 1, 1925, made by Philip Hauck in favour of Engelbert Hauck, payable one year after date with interest at 5 per cent. Promissory note for $70 dated May 1, 1925, made by Philip Hauck in favour of Engelbert Hauck, payable six months after date with interest at 5 per cent. Promissory note for $250 dated November 1, 1925, made by Philip Hauck in favour of Engelbert Hauck, payable one year after date with interest at 5 per cent. Promissory note for $1,500 dated November 1, 1925, made by Philip Hauck in favour of Engelbert Hauck, payable one year after date with interest at 5 per cent. Promissory note for $8,066 dated November 1, 1928, made by Clarence A. Hauck, payable at the Imperial Bank of Canada, Daysland, Alberta, as soon as possible after date. Promissory note for $7,200 dated December 1, 1926, made by H. Hauck in favour of Engelbert Hauck, payable as soon as possible after date. Promissory note for $1,000 dated March 1, 1927, made by Albin Hauck in favour of Engelbert Hauck, payable three years after date with interest at 4 per cent per annum. Promissory note for $2,000 dated March 30, 1922, made by Albin Hauck in favour of E. Hauck, payable twelve months after date with interest at 4 per cent.\nThe issue came on for trial before Mr. Justice Ewing at Edmonton, on the 22nd March, 1934. That learned judge construed the will to mean that the plaintiffs were discharged of their obligations under the notes. On appeal to the Appellate Division that judgment was reversed (Lunney J. A. and McGillivray J. A. dissenting)[2]. The plaintiffs now appeal to this Court.\nThe question for determination is: What was the intention of Engelbert Hauck, did he intend to discharge and release the plaintiffs from their respective liabilities on the promissory notes which he held, or did he intend that these notes should still be obligations on the part of his sons and form part of his estate?\nFor the purpose of ascertaining the intention of a testator the will is to be read in the first place without reference to or regard to the consequences of any rule of law or canon of construction. The words are to be given their usual and ordinary meaning, the particular passage concerned being taken together with whatever is relevant in the rest of the will to explain it.\nThe will gives, devises and bequeaths\nall my real and personal estate of which I may die possessed in the following manner, that is to say: * * *\nNo assistance can be derived from this disposition of his property, as, later on in the will, he directs that, with the exception of the advance to Joseph, no account shall be \"taken or had of advances heretofore made by me to any of my children.\" These are the words requiring interpretation. Without these words the notes would undoubtedly have formed part of his estate. But the question is: To what was he referring when he used the word \"advances\"?\nFrom the language of the will it appears that Joseph owed his father $1,000, which the father says was \"in consideration of advances made to him.\" From the evidence put in this was shewn to be in connection with some partnership transaction in land which Joseph and his father had entered into together in 1910. The will speaks of it as advances to Joseph. But whether it was cash loaned to Joseph or money paid by the father for Joseph's share in the partnership is not disclosed. At any rate in the end it was a debt which Joseph was to pay into the estate, but, with the exception of that advance, the executors were directed not to take into account any other advance which the father may have made to any of his children.\nThe word \"advances\" primarily means advances of money whether by way of loan or payment at the request of the legatee. In re Jacques, Hodgson v. Braisby[3]. In that case Stirling J., at page 274, said:\nThe word primarily refers to advances of money. And advances of money is commonly spoken of, and the expression is perfectly intelligible to everyone; but an advance of a house or a chattel would not be understood without explanation by anyone but a lawyer.\nIn referring to his \"advances\" to Joseph the father used the word in its primary meaning. What reason have we for concluding that he did not give it its primary meaning when referring to advances to his other children?\nThe evidence put in shews what the moneys represented by the notes was given for. In every case it was cash given to the son, or paid out by the father at the son's request, or property sold by the father to his son and a promissory note taken for the price, or a part thereof. It was admitted by the plaintiffs that they looked upon the money received from their father as loans and that they had always intended to pay them when they got in a position to do so.\nIf the words \"advances heretofore made\" do not refer to the moneys for which the plaintiffs gave notes, there is nothing either in the will or in the evidence which shews to what it does refer. It was suggested that it might refer to some gift of money or household furniture (not over $100) which the evidence discloses was given to each of the daughters on her marriage. In my opinion this suggestion cannot be accepted, not only on account of the smallness of the amount but also because it is highly improbable that the father would have kept track of wedding presents, or would have expected them to be returned to him or paid for. None of the members of the family know of any other moneys having been loaned or given to any of the children.\nIn the case at bar we are asked to read \"advances\" in the sense of the expression \"advancement by portion\" and then apply the equitable presumption against double portions. I do not think this presumption can have any application to a case of this kind. The father was making loans to his sons to help them along, he was not advancing to them a portion of what they were to receive out of his estate. They were loans which the boys intended to pay back. No doubt he was not pressing either for principal or interest, but some of the boys were paying interest regularly. Then, on October 29th, 1930, he came to make his will. In doing so he must be supposed to have reviewed in his mind the circumstances of each of his children, and then to have done, as Lord Cottenham said in Pym v. Lockyer[4], quoted with approval by Bowen L.J. in In re Lacon[5]:\nA father who makes his will, dividing his property amongst his children, must be supposed to have decided what under the then existing circumstances ought to be the portion of each child, not with reference to the wants of each, but attributing to each the share of the whole which, with reference to the wants of all, each ought to possess.\nThe survey of the circumstances of his children would shew the testator that his four daughters were all married and were in fair financial circumstances; that, owing to the hail and drought of 1929 and 1930, the crops around Heisler were, in these years, almost negligible. The farmers were unable to pay their bills with the result that his sons, who were in business there, had suffered great losses and were themselves faced with insolvency and would be forced into bankruptcy if called upon to pay the notes he held which they would be upon his death unless they were protected. The sons who were farming in the west were experiencing the results of bad crops or no crops at all from drought and depression. Joseph, who was living in Ontario, may have been well-to-do. So far as the will or the evidence discloses no sums other than those secured by the plaintiffs' notes were ever given by the father to any of his children. Why then reject the construction that he intended to cancel the notes? The objection taken to this construction is that it contravenes the view of law that equality is what the father in dealing with his children would in most cases presumedly intend. This presumption, however, does not apply where the language is clear and plain, and, where it does apply, it may be rebutted. Whatever reason the father had for making Joseph pay the advance to him while cancelling the notes of the other sons, we need not inquire, for in unambiguous language he directs that Joseph's debt should be charged against what Joseph was receiving from the estate. Now it is a paramount rule that a testator can do as he likes with his own property. All he has to do is to say, in clear and unambiguous language, to whom it is to go and the courts will respect his wishes. In my opinion the language of this will is sufficiently clear and unambiguous and, as there were no moneys advanced by him except those covered by the notes, I think the notes are what he was referring to.\nI therefore agree with the trial judge that the fair construction of the will is that the moneys covered by the notes were not to be brought into hotchpot but were to be treated as no longer owing. It is, in my opinion, not sufficient answer for a court to say: \"We do not know what the testator meant by 'advances heretofore made by me to my children' but as the construction given to it in the court below works an inequality as between the children, the testator could not have meant that.\"\nI take it that this father, along with many another father in the western provinces, in the last five years, was confronted in making his will with the question, not: How can I divide my estate so that all my children will get an equal share? But: How can I distribute it so as to keep them from being forced into bankruptcy?\nThe appeal will therefore be allowed, the judgment below set aside and the judgment of the trial judge restored.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\n[1] [1934] 3 W.W.R. 335.\n[2] [1934] 3 W.W.R. 335.\n[3] [1903] 1 Ch. 267.\n[4] (1840) 10 L.J.

One part of the scraper extended about ten or twelve inches farther to the left than the side of the tractor, and it is assumed that the deceased collided with that part of the scrapper, as a result of which he lost control of his machine, which turned over three times and did not come to stop until it had reached a distance of 200 feet behind the tractor. The driver, the late Robillard, was almost instantly killed. The respondent presented a petition of right on the 18th July, 1930, praying that she be authorized to take action against the \u201cMinister of Roads\u201d to recover the sum of $10,000.00 damages. At the conclusion of the enqu\u00eate, the respondent presented a motion for leave to amend the conclusions of her petition by substituting the name of \u201cHis Majesty the King\u201d for the \u201cMinister of Roads\u201d This motion was granted by the trial judge at the same time that he rendered judgment on the merits, by which he found that the accident was due to the common fault of the deceased and the servants of the Department of Roads, and he, accordingly, gave judgment in favour of the respondent for the sum of $5,000. This judgment was affirmed by a majority of the appellate court.\nCharles Lanclot K.C. and Adolphe Allard K.C. for the appellant.\nAim\u00e9 Chass\u00e9 K.C. and Maurice Boisvert K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Duff C.J. and Davis J. was delivered by\nDuff C.J.\u2014I agree with the learned trial judge that the arrangement of the lights upon the vehicle that Bolduc, the servant of the Roads Department, was driving, when the mishap occurred in which the husband of the respondent lost his life, was calculated to mislead the drivers of automobiles met with on the road; and that the servants of the Roads Department were guilty of actionable negligence in proceeding along the road in such circumstances.\nI concur with the majority of the Court of King\u2019s Bench in their view that the appeal of the Crown from the learned trial judge could not be sustained as concerns the issues of fact. This was my view at the conclusion of the argument; and a careful examination of the evidence since then confirms it. I also agree with the majority of the Court of King\u2019s Bench that it was competent to the Superior Court to give judgment upon the petition of right as framed, or to amend the same if that were necessary. My own view is that amendment was unnecessary.\nNeither before us, nor at any stage of the proceedings, was it contended on behalf of the Crown that, given the facts as found by the majority of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, a petition of right, properly framed, would not lie for the damages claimed by the respondent. It must be taken to be conceded, for the purposes of this case, that a petition of right, properly framed, lies, but we are giving no decision upon the point.\nThe appeal should, therefore, be dismissed with costs.\nLamont J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed. The only question is: Has it been shown that the accident was caused or contributed to by the failure of the Department of Highways for the province of Quebec, which owned and operated the truck and the scraper, to have sufficient and proper lights on the scraper when being driven along the highway at night?\nThe truck was going towards Sherbrooke while the automobile, driven by the petitioner\u2019s late husband, was going in the opposite direction towards Magog. It was about ten o\u2019clock at night and dark. A collision took place in which the husband of the petitioner was killed.\nThe truck was travelling at a speed of four miles an hour; the automobile was travelling thirty-five miles at least. Behind the truck a scraper used for levelling the road or keeping it smooth was being dragged. This scraper was fitted to a frame which was attached to the truck by means of a chain about five feet long. This scraper not only covered the ground the full width of the truck, but extended some ten inches beyond its left side.\nThe truck had the following lights: (a) two headlights in front (white lights); (b) a red lantern on the left side of the truck hanging from the top over the driver\u2019s seat; (c) another white light behind the tractor which could not be seen by anyone travelling in a direction opposite to that of the truck, but which was intended to reflect the light upon the scraper and in this manner notify drivers of automobiles or other vehicles of the danger to be apprehended from the scraper extending into the road ten inches further than the truck. It was in fact this extension of the scraper beyond the truck that caused the damage.\nThe deceased man was driving at a rapid pace on a good road towards Magog; he safely passed the truck but ran against the scraper with the result that his automobile turned over three times, went into a five foot ditch, and he was killed. With the two headlights shining in his face it would be difficult, in my opinion, for the driver of the automobile to see any reflection on the scraper from the light behind the truck, and, in any case, the existence of the red light on the left side of the truck indicated the extreme left of the danger to be apprehended, whereas the danger which caused the accident was the extension of the scraper beyond the red light. In my opinion there was abundant evidence to justify the finding that the accident was due to the common fault of the driver of the automobile in driving at the rate of speed at which he was going and a failure on the part of the operator of the truck in not having the scraper sufficiently and properly lighted. If the truck and scraper are to be operated at night, proper precautions must be taken to notify those using the road of the danger to be apprehended. The red flag which was attached to the scraper might convey warning during the day when it could be seen, but it was perfectly useless for that purpose on a dark night.\nThe argument that it was ultra vires the power of the Superior Court judge to effect a change in the name of the respondent was properly rejected by the Court of King\u2019s Bench.\nCannon J.\u2014La Cour du Banc du Roi, ayant renvoy\u00e9, par une majorit\u00e9 de trois \u00e0 deux, l\u2019appel de la Couronne du jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure maintenant une p\u00e9tition de droit jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence de $5,000 en faveur de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, la Couronne nous demande de renvoyer l\u2019action parce que la p\u00e9tition de droit aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 ill\u00e9galement amend\u00e9e apr\u00e8s l\u2019audition et avant jugement en substituant, dans les conclusions, les mots \u201cSa Majest\u00e9 le Roi\u201d aux mots \u201cle ministre de la voirie.\u201d Malgr\u00e9 tout le respect avec lequel nous avons \u00e9cout\u00e9 la savante plaidoirie de l\u2019assistant-procureur-g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la province de Qu\u00e9bec sur ce point, je dois dire que je crois, avec la Cour du Banc du Roi, que le juge de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure avait le pouvoir d\u2019amender la proc\u00e9dure et de consid\u00e9rer que, d\u00e8s le commencement, en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, le gouvernement de la province de Qu\u00e9bec \u00e9tait en cause.\nLe juge de premi\u00e8re instance, tout en bl\u00e2mant le mari de la requ\u00e9rante d\u2019avoir conduit sa voiture \u00e0 grande vitesse, qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas diminu\u00e9e pour rencontrer le tracteur et la niveleuse, a trouv\u00e9 le gouvernement responsable parce que cette niveleuse ne portait pas une lumi\u00e8re ni un autre signal pouvant indiquer le danger, la nuit, r\u00e9sultant du fait que cette niveleuse \u00e9tait plus large que le tracteur et que le couteau du centre exc\u00e9dait le cadre de la niveleuse d\u2019environ dix pouces \u00e0 gauche. Le savant juge, sans avoir entendu les t\u00e9moins, vu que l\u2019enqu\u00eate a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite \u00e0 Sorel devant un commissaire, a exprim\u00e9 l\u2019opinion, apr\u00e8s avoir, comme nous, simplement lu la preuve, qu\u2019il y a eu faute de la part de l\u2019employ\u00e9 de la voirie en charge du tracteur et de la niveleuse, parce qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas indiqu\u00e9 le danger comme il aurait d\u00fb le faire. Le jugement dit:\nConsid\u00e9rant que le tracteur \u00e9tait conduit \u00e0 la droite du chemin et portant sur le devant deux lumi\u00e8res blanches et, en plus, une lumi\u00e8re rouge, \u00e0 gauche, pr\u00e8s du si\u00e8ge du conducteur.\nLa lecture du dossier me force d\u2019arriver \u00e0 la conclusion qu\u2019une partie de la preuve doit avoir \u00e9chapp\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019attention du savant juge, parce qu\u2019en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, \u00e0 part ces deux lumi\u00e8res blanches et la lumi\u00e8re rouge, il y avait, en arri\u00e8re du tracteur, une lumi\u00e8re blanche qui \u00e9clairait la niveleuse.\nHector Bolduc, qui \u00e9tait en charge du tracteur, nous dit que cette gratte avait 10 pieds de large, et que, le soir de l\u2019accident, vers dix heures, \u00e0 part des phares, il y avait deux lumi\u00e8res sur le tracteur, en avant, sur le c\u00f4t\u00e9, \u00e0 gauche, une lumi\u00e8re rouge, et en arri\u00e8re une lumi\u00e8re blanche qui refl\u00e9tait sur la niveleuse, et un pavillon sur la gratte \u00e0 gauche. Il ajoute qu\u2019au moment de l\u2019accident la gratte occupait la moiti\u00e9 du chemin qui \u00e9tait droit et planche.\nJoseph Hamel nous dit avoir, imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s l\u2019accident, mesur\u00e9 l\u2019espace qu\u2019il y avait entre le couteau du milieu de la gratte, qui exc\u00e9dait le tracteur d\u2019environ dix pouces, et l\u2019autre c\u00f4t\u00e9 du chemin carossable. Il nous dit qu\u2019il y avait l\u00e0 un espace de dix pieds, libre pour le passage de l\u2019automobile, venant \u00e0 la rencontre de l\u2019appareil. Le m\u00eame t\u00e9moin, dit que, imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s l\u2019accident, il a constat\u00e9 qu\u2019il y avait une lumi\u00e8re en arri\u00e8re du tracteur, qui refl\u00e9tait sur la gratte.\nUn troisi\u00e8me t\u00e9moin, Odilon Vaillancourt, corrobore Joseph Hamel quant \u00e0 la distance de dix pieds entre le couteau de la gratte et le bord du chemin \u00e0 gauche. Il dit avoir remarqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il y avait une lumi\u00e8re en arri\u00e8re du tracteur qui refl\u00e9tait sur la gratte. Il n\u2019a pas m\u00eame \u00e9t\u00e9 transquestionn\u00e9 sur ce point.\nJe suis donc du m\u00eame avis que l\u2019honorable juge Hall, en Cour du Banc du Roi, lorsqu\u2019il dit:\nThe only ground of fault charged by the learned trial judge against the Department is that, while the tractor was properly lighted, the scraper itself, which was being towed behind the tractor, carried no light or any other signal designed to indicate the danger.\nWhile it is true that there was no light on the scraper itself, the trial judge has apparently overlooked the fact that there was on the scraper a red flag, and that, on the rear of the tractor itself there was a white light directly illuminating and making plainly visible the scraper with its warning flag.\nThe tractor was provided, in addition to the two ordinary lights, with a red lantern carried on the left side attached to the top of the chauffeur\u2019s cab.\nThe driver of any vehicle, therefore, approaching the tractor, received ample warning of the presence of some dangerous condition, which should have prompted to decrease his speed and pay careful attention as he was passing the tractor.\nHad the deceased Robillard paid attention to this warning he could not have failed to see the scraper illuminated as it was by the rear light of the tractor, and carrying as it did a red flag.\nIt is fully established that the tractor was on the right side of the road, and that there was a space of at least ten feet between the extreme limit of the scraper and the other side of the road.\nThere was, therefore, ample room for the deceased to pass the tractor and the scraper in perfect safety had he been driving with ordinary care.\nAs was held by the Supreme Court of Canada in The King v. Gilbert[1], I am of the opinion that the precautions taken by the Road Department in the present instance were all that were reasonably necessary, and would offer ample protection to any one driving an automobile with reasonable care and attention.\nThe accident was, in my opinion, due to the sole fault of the late Lucien Robillard himself.\nIl est prouv\u00e9 \u00e0 ma satisfaction que le tracteur et la gratte \u00e9taient du c\u00f4t\u00e9 droit du chemin et qu\u2019il y avait entre l\u2019extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 de la gratte et l\u2019autre c\u00f4t\u00e9 du chemin un espace libre d\u2019au moins dix pieds. Si le d\u00e9funt s\u2019\u00e9tait conform\u00e9 aux exigences statutaires et avait gard\u00e9 sa droite, le plus pr\u00e8s possible du bord du chemin, il aurait, malgr\u00e9 sa vitesse d\u00e9sordonn\u00e9e, \u00e9vit\u00e9 l\u2019accident.\nJe crois que l\u2019argument d\u00e9cisif en faveur de la Couronne, c\u2019est que l\u2019accident ne serait jamais arriv\u00e9 si la victime en conduisant l\u2019automobile avait ob\u00e9i \u00e0 la loi S.R.Q. c. 35, c. 36, qui dit:\nEvery person driving a vehicle * * * on the public highway must, whenever possible, keep to the side of the road at his right and leave at his left as wide a passage as possible and at least one half of the road when meeting another vehicle. * * *\nPour moi, le savant juge-en-chef suppl\u00e9ant a imput\u00e9 comme faute \u00e0 l\u2019employ\u00e9 de la voirie l\u2019absence d\u2019un signal sur la gratte, sans prendre en consid\u00e9ration la preuve que cette gratte, munie d\u2019un pavillon, \u00e9tait \u00e9clair\u00e9e, tel qu\u2019indiqu\u00e9 par les t\u00e9moins mentionn\u00e9s plus haut qui compl\u00e8tent le t\u00e9moignage de Montgrain, qui \u00e9tait \u00e0 bord de l\u2019automobile. Ce dernier nous dit avoir vu la gratte apr\u00e8s l\u2019accident, \u00e0 une distance de 50 \u00e0 75 pieds, de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 pouvoir la d\u00e9crire dans son t\u00e9moignage. Elle \u00e9tait donc visible \u00e0 cette distance. Il est vrai qu\u2019il ajoute qu\u2019il pense que \u201cle nez de la machine de Robillard se trouvait revir\u00e9 et que la lumi\u00e8re frappait.\u201d Mais nous avons le t\u00e9moignage de trois t\u00e9moins qui nous disent que c\u2019\u00e9tait bien la lumi\u00e8re blanche d\u2019en arri\u00e8re, ignor\u00e9e par le premier juge, qui refl\u00e9tait sur la gratte et devait l\u2019\u00e9clairer suffisamment pour qu\u2019une personne approchant pour rencontrer \u00e0 une vitesse raisonnable ait pu la distinguer assez t\u00f4t pour passer sans encombre.\nComme dans l\u2019affaire Gilbert[2], je crois donc que cette cour devrait en venir \u00e0 la conclusion que des pr\u00e9cautions raisonnables avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 prises pour fournir ample protection \u00e0 toute personne voyageant en automobile avec le soin et l\u2019attention qui s\u2019imposent lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit, la nuit, de rencontrer un v\u00e9hicule indiqu\u00e9 par deux lumi\u00e8res blanches, une lumi\u00e8re rouge et une autre lumi\u00e8re \u00e9clairant en arri\u00e8re.\nJe serais donc d\u2019avis de maintenir l\u2019appel et de renvoyer la p\u00e9tition de droit avec d\u00e9pens, si la Couronne croit opportun de les exiger. Dorion J. (ad hoc)\u2014(1) La demande de rejet de la requ\u00eate pour permission d\u2019amender la p\u00e9tition de droit en rempla\u00e7ant les mots \u201cLe Ministre de la Voirie\u201d par les mots \u201cSa Majest\u00e9 le Roi\u201d dans la description de l\u2019intim\u00e9e doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e.\nSans doute, le Gouvernement est repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par le Procureur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Comme son nom l\u2019indique, celui-ci est vraiment porteur d\u2019une procuration pour repr\u00e9senter le Gouvernement en toute mati\u00e8re judiciaire.\nOr, il n\u2019y a pas de doute que, par les mots \u201cMinistre de la Voirie,\u201d on a voulu d\u00e9signer le Gouvernement de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, en tant que ce minist\u00e8re est concern\u00e9.\nC\u2019est ainsi que l\u2019a compris le Gouvernement lui-m\u00eame puisqu\u2019il a accord\u00e9 la p\u00e9tition de droit.\nL\u2019amendement n\u2019a fait que rectifier la d\u00e9signation du repr\u00e9sentant de Sa Majest\u00e9, on y d\u00e9signe la partie d\u00e9fenderesse sous le nom de \u201c Sa Majest\u00e9\u201d lui-m\u00eame, et la comparution des officiers du Procureur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral repr\u00e9sentait la Couronne et continue de le faire apr\u00e8s le changement de nom et donne pleine juridiction au tribunal;\n(2) Quand \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019accident, il s\u2019agit de peser laquelle des fautes commises, celle de l\u2019intim\u00e9e ou celle de la victime, a \u00e9t\u00e9 cause du dommage, ou si les deux y ont contribu\u00e9.\nIl semble bien certain que la niveleuse d\u00e9passait en largeur le tracteur d\u2019environ un pied. Un fanal plac\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019arri\u00e8re du tracteur projetait quelque lumi\u00e8re sur la niveleuse et celle-ci portait un pavillon rouge \u00e0 l\u2019arri\u00e8re.\nUne voiture venant \u00e0 la rencontre pouvait voir qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une rencontre inusit\u00e9e, ce qui aurait d\u00fb provoquer beaucoup d\u2019attention de la part de la victime.\nIl voyait les deux lumi\u00e8res blanches \u00e0 l\u2019avant du tracteur et une lumi\u00e8re rouge. A-t-il vu le reste? Cela n\u2019est pas prouv\u00e9. Mais la vue de ces trois lumi\u00e8res, dont une lumi\u00e8re rouge, chose insolite, aurait d\u00fb le mettre sur ses gardes.\nIl avait l\u2019espace suffisant pour passer en gardant le c\u00f4t\u00e9 droit, et il n\u2019est pas prudent, pendant la nuit, de suivre de trop pr\u00e8s la ligne m\u00e9diane d\u2019un chemin m\u00eame en gardant son c\u00f4t\u00e9. La faute principale de la victime consiste dans l\u2019allure immod\u00e9r\u00e9e avec laquelle il conduisait son automobile. Il me semble certain, ou du moins extr\u00eamement probable, que s\u2019il e\u00fbt gard\u00e9 la vitesse r\u00e9glementaire, il eut d\u2019abord eu le temps d\u2019\u00e9viter l\u2019accident en apercevant de plus pr\u00e8s la machine. Au moins, l\u2019accident n\u2019aurait pas eu les cons\u00e9quences tragiques qui sont arriv\u00e9es.\nLes compagnons de la victime admettent que cette vitesse \u00e9tait de 35 milles.\nLes t\u00e9moins qui ont vu les d\u00e9bris de la machine et les traces laiss\u00e9es sur la route ont affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il devait aller \u00e0 50 milles \u00e0 l\u2019heure.\nIl m\u2019est impossible de conclure en faveur de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. La cause de l\u2019accident est la vitesse avec laquelle la victime conduisait son automobile. Le tracteur et la niveleuse n\u2019\u00e9taient pas un obstacle s\u00e9rieux \u00e0 franchir pour un chauffeur qui eut exerc\u00e9 la prudence \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire et requise de tous ceux qui se servent des chemins publics.\nIl ne me semble pas que l\u2019on soit oblig\u00e9 de veiller \u00e0 la s\u00fbret\u00e9 de ceux qui prennent les risques d\u2019actes d\u00e9raisonnables, et que l\u2019on soit tenu de se conduire avec la perfection n\u00e9cessaire pour prot\u00e9ger ceux qui se jettent dans le danger.\nJ\u2019infirmerais le jugement et je rejetterais l\u2019action.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Adolphe Allard.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Aim\u00e9 Chass\u00e9.\n[1] [1933] 1 D.L.R. 795.\n[2] [1933] 1 D.L.R. 795.\n",

(2) If the answer to question 1 is in the negative, is Part II of the Canada Temperance Act in operation in said counties? (3) If the answer to question 2 is in the negative, what procedure must be adopted to bring the said Part II into operation in said counties?\nHeld (Cannon and Crocket JJ. dissenting), that question 1 be answered in the negative, and question 2 in the affirmative.\nPer Duff C.J. and Lamont and Davis JJ.: The condition for applying the suspension under said s. 175 is that the laws of the province relating to the sale and traffic in intoxicating liquors shall be as \u201crestrictive\u201d of such sale and traffic as the provisions of Parts I to IV of the Canada Temperance Act; and the comparison required for the purposes of applying the condition is a comparison of the laws of the province with the provisions of said Parts of the Canada Temperance Act; there is not contemplated a process of measuring the comparative efficacy of two legislative enactments in the suppression or reduction of excessive consumption of liquor; the comparison to be instituted is between the provisions of one statute restricting the sale and traffic in intoxicating liquors and the provisions of another dealing with the same subject. And, comparing the Dominion and Ontario legislation in question, it is clear that, in point of restrictiveness,, the Ontario Act makes no attempt to approach the prohibitory provisions of Part II of the Canada Temperance Act; the Canada Temperance Act, speaking broadly, has for its object the prevention of commercial dealings in intoxicating liquor within the territory in which it is in force; the Ontario Liquor Control Act, in its essence, is an Act for regulating the sale and consumption of such liquor, and makes provision for enabling the people to procure such liquor by the purchase of it through Government stores and other agencies. Therefore, the \u201cprovincial laws\u201d having ceased to \u201ccontinue as restrictive\u201d as the Canada Temperance Act, the suspension of the operation of Parts I to IV of the Canada Temperance Act in the counties in question has ceased. The said words \u201ccontinue as restrictive as aforesaid\u201d should not be construed as if the words \u201cin the opinion of the Governor in Council\u201d were inserted therein; and no declaration by the Governor in Council is required to effect the cessation of the suspension.\nAs to the question of the constitutional validity of the Canada Temperance Act, raised in argument\u2014Reading the order of reference in light of Russell v. The Queen, 7 App. Cas. 829, and Att. Gen. for Ontario v. Att. Gen. for the Dominion (local option reference), [1896] A.C. 348, the questions submitted should not be construed as involving any such question.\nPer Cannon J. (dissenting): From the nature and provisions of the Canada Temperance Act, as a whole, and having regard to ss. 23 and 31 of the Interpretation Act (R.s.C. 1927, c. 1), the suspension under said s. 175 can cease only by proclamation to that effect by the Governor General in Council, fixing a date for such cessation of suspension. Part II of the Canada Temperance Act is not in operation in the counties in question.\nPer Crocket J. (dissenting): On the true construction of said s. 175, the question as to whether the laws of any province relating to the sale and traffic in intoxicating liquors are at any time as restrictive as the provisions of Parts I to IV of the Canada Temperance Act, is one for the determination of the Governor in Council and not for a court. Part II of said Act is not in operation in the counties in question. The procedure to bring it into operation, is to rescind the orders in council suspending the operation of the Act in said counties, if the Governor in Council is satisfied that the provisions of the liquor laws of Ontario are not as restrictive as those of Parts I to IV of the Canada Temperance Act, and to promulgate the rescinding orders in the usual manner. REFERENCE by His Excellency the Governor General in Council to the Supreme Court of Canada, in the exercise of the powers conferred by s. 55 of the Supreme Court Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 35), of the following questions: (1) Are the provincial laws respecting intoxicating liquor as restrictive since the coming into force of The Liquor Control Act of Ontario, as amended in 1934, as the Canada Temperance Act? (2) If the answer to question 1 is in the negative, is Part II of the Canada Temperance Act in operation in the counties of Perth, Huron and Peel in the province of Ontario? (3) If the answer to question 2 is in the negative, what procedure must be adopted to bring the said Part II into operation in the said counties?\nThe Order in Council referring the questions to the Court, which contains a statement of the circumstances, and references to the legislation, which led to the order of reference being made, is set out in full at the beginning of the judgment of Duff C.J.\nP.

It is convenient to set out the Order in Council in full:\nAT THE GOVERNMENT HOUSE AT OTTAWA\nTuesday, the 12th day\nof February, 1935.\npresent:\nHIS EXCELLENCY THE GOVERNOR GENERAL IN COUNCIL\nWHEREAS there has been laid before His Excellency the Governor General in Council a report from the Minister of Justice, representing as follows:\u2014 Part II of the Canada Temperance Act, chapter 196 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1(927, prohibits, as therein provided, the dealing with, including the sale of, with certain exceptions such as for medicinal purposes, intoxicating liquor in any county or city after that Part comes into force and takes effect in such county or city.\nPart I of the said Act provides for the bringing of the said Part II into force by Order in Council on the vote of the electors of such county or city indicating a desire therefor, and also for the revocation of such Order in Council after the expiration of three years from the date of the coming into force of the said Part II and after another vote of the electors indicating a desire for such revocation.\nIn 1916 the Parliament of Canada enacted by chapter 19 of the Statutes of 1916 \u201cAn Act in aid of Provincial Legislation prohibiting or restricting the sale or use of Intoxicating Liquors,\u201d and in 1917 Parliament enacted by Chapter 30 of the Statutes of 1917 \u201cAn Act to amend An Act in aid of Provincial Legislation prohibiting or restricting the sale of Intoxicating Liquors,\u201d and by Section 2 thereof amended the said Act of 1916 by adding thereto as Section 4C the following:\u2014\n\u201c4C (1) Upon the receipt by the Secretary of State of Canada of a petition, in accordance with the requirements of sections one hundred and eleven, one hundred and twelve and one hundred and thirteen of the Canada Temperance Act, Revised Statutes of Canada 1906, chapter one hundred and fifty-two, praying for the revocation of any order in council passed for bringing Part II of the Canada Temperance Act into force in any city or county, if the Governor in Council is of opinion that the laws of the province in which such city or county is situated, relating to the sale and traffic in intoxicating liquors, are as restrictive as the provisions of the said Canada Temperance Act, the Governor in Council may, without the polling of any votes, by order, to be published in the Canada Gazette, suspend the operation of the Canada Temperance Act in such city or county, such suspension to commence ten days after the date of the publication of such order and to continue as long as the provincial laws continue as restrictive as aforesaid.\n\u201c(2) The present Section shall apply to petitions already made and upon which no polling has yet taken place.\u201d\nwhich section was carried into the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927, as Section 175 of the Canada Temperance Act, reading as follows:\u2014\n\u201cUpon the receipt by the Secretary of State of Canada of a petition, in accordance with the requirements of sections one hundred and twelve, one hundred and thirteen and one hundred and fourteen of this Act praying for the revocation of any Order in Council passed for bringing Part II of this Act into force in any city or county, if the Governor in Council is of opinion that the laws of the province in which such city or county is situated, relating to the sale and traffic in intoxicating liquors, are as restrictive as the provisions of Parts I to IV, both inclusive, of this Act, the Governor in Council may without the polling of any votes, by order, to be published in the Canada Gazette, suspend the operation of the said Parts of this Act in such city or county, such suspension to commence ten days after the date of the publication of such order and to continue as long as the provincial laws continue as restrictive as aforesaid.\u201d\nPart II of the said Act came into force after a vote by the electors in the Counties of Perth, Huron and Peel in the Province of Ontario on April 18, 1914, April 28, 1914, and September 1, 1915, respectively. The Ontario Temperance Act, Chapter 50 of the Statutes of Ontario, 1916, and amendments thereto, was in force in the year 1921, the said Act having the effect of prohibiting dealings in intoxicating liquors except, generally, for medicinal purposes pursuant to the provisions of the said Act.\nUnder the provisions of the said Section 4C, Orders in Council dated 12th November, 1920, 12th November, 1920, and 24th March, 1921, were passed suspending the operation of the provisions of the Canada Temperance Act in the said Counties of Perth, Huron and Peel, respectively, and providing that such suspensions were to continue as long as the provincial law remained as restrictive as the Canada Temperance Act. Such suspensions became effective on 30th November, 1920, 30th November, 1920, and 12th April, 1921, respectively.\nBy the Liquor Control Act (Ontario), being Chapter 70 of the Statutes of Ontario, 1927, The Ontario Temperance Act was repealed, and other provisions were substituted respecting the dealing with intoxicating liquors and the sale and purchase thereof by permit in accordance with such provisions. The said The Liquor Control Act (Ontario) was brought into force by proclamations by Sections, and on the dates as follows: Sections 1 to 31, inclusive, 37 to 41, inclusive, 43, 68, and 69, on April 6, 1927; Sections 70 and 94 on May 26, 1927; Sections 32 to 36, inclusive, 42, 44 to 67, inclusive, 71 to 92, inclusive, and 95 to 146, inclusive, on June 1, 1927, and Section 93 on March 14, 1928.\nBy the Liquor Control Act, 1934, being Chapter 26 of the Statutes of Ontario, The Liquor Control Act (Ontario) was amended, particularly with respect to the sale of beer and wine; such amendments were brought into force by proclamation on July 12, 1934.\nBy a decision of the Court of Appeal of the Province of New Brunswick in the case of Sheehan v. Shaw[1], the Court held in effect:\u2014\n(a) That the question of deciding whether The Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1921 (N.B.), is as restrictive as the Canada Temperance Act is one for the decision of the Governor in Council, and not for the decision of that Court.\n(b) That the Canada Temperance Act having been suspended in a certain county it will continue suspended until the Governor in Council advises that the said Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1927, is not as restrictive as to the sale and traffic in intoxicating liquors as the Canada Temperance Act, or it will continue suspended if no action is taken by the Governor in Council in regard to the matter.\nConsiderable legal opinion, including that of the Department of Justice, is in conflict with the decision of the Court of Appeal in New Brunswick.\nAND WHEREAS the Minister of Justice is of the opinion that it is expedient that the questions in controversy respecting the interpretation of Section 4C of Chapter 19 of the Statutes of 1916, as enacted by Section 2 of Chapter 30 of the Statutes of 1917 and of Section 175 of the Canada Temperance Act and whether or not Part II of the Canada Temperance Act is in operation in the said Counties, should be referred to the Supreme Court of Canada for hearing and consideration;\nTHEREFORE His Excellency the Governor General in Council, in the exercise of the powers conferred by Section 55 of the Supreme Court Act, is pleased, hereby, to refer to the Supreme Court of Canada for hearing and consideration the following questions:\nQuestion 1\u2014\nAre the provincial laws respecting intoxicating liquor as restrictive since the coming into force of The Liquor Control Act of Ontario, as amended in 1934, as the Canada Temperance Act?\nQuestion 2\u2014\nIf the answer to Question 1 is in the negative, is Part II of the Canada Temperance Act in operation in the said Counties of Perth, Huron and Peel?\nQuestion 3\u2014\nIf the answer to Question 2 is in the negative, what procedure must be adopted to bring the said Part II into operation in the said Counties?\nE. J. Lemaire,\nClerk of the Privy Council.\nThe first question for examination in logical order concerns the construction of section 175. The condition with which we are concerned under which a suspension, by force of that section, comes into operation is embodied in the words,\n* * * if the Governor in Council is of opinion that the laws of the province in which such city or county is situated, relating to the sale and traffic in intoxicating liquors, are as restrictive as the provisions of Parts I to IV, both inclusive, of this Act.\nThe meaning of these words, in our opinion, is that the laws of the province relating to the sale and traffic in intoxicating liquors shall be as \u201crestrictive\u201d of such sale and traffic as the provisions of Parts I to IV of the Canada Temperance Act. Moreover, the comparison required for the purposes of applying the condition is a comparison of the laws of the province with the provisions of the Parts of the Canada Temperance Act mentioned. We do not think that these words contemplate a process of measuring the comparative efficacy of two legislative enactments in the suppression or the reduction of excessive consumption of intoxicating liquor. The comparison to be instituted is between the provisions of one statute restricting the sale and traffic in intoxicating liquors and the provisions of another dealing with the same subject.\nAs regards the two statutes now before us, we think there is no difficulty, for reasons we shall presently give, in reaching a conclusion without resort to evidence touching the practical operation of the statutes; but, before explaining these reasons, it is necessary to consider the decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick in Sheehan v. Shaw[2].\nThe advisers of His Excellency have had some doubts about that decision and it is because of these doubts that the interrogatories set out in the Order in Council are now before us. The question concerns the final clause of section 175, which is in these words:\n* * * such suspension to commence ten days after the date of the publication of such order and to continue as long as the provincial laws continue as restrictive as aforesaid.\nThe Supreme Court of New Brunswick held that the suspension of the operation of Parts I to IV of the Canada Temperance Act effected by an Order in Council, published pursuant to this section, does not come to an end until the Governor in Council has declared that \u201cthe provincial laws do not continue as restrictive as aforesaid.\u201d\nEx facie, the suspension continues so long, and only so long as \u201cthe provincial laws continue as restrictive as aforesaid.\u201d \u201cAs restrictive as aforesaid\u201d means, we think, according to the natural and grammatical import of the words, as restrictive of the sale and traffic in intoxicating liquors as the provisions of Parts I to IV of the Canada Temperance Act. The words \u201ccontinue as restrictive as aforesaid,\u201d which the Legislature has selected, seem to imply that the suspending order is conclusive as regards the validity of the assumption upon which it is based, viz., that the provincial laws are, in the material respects, as restrictive as the provisions of the Canada Temperance Act, and that this conclusiveness continues to attach to the order so long as the several legislative enactments remain unchanged; but, it would, we think, be a non-natural reading of the words to construe them as if there were inserted after \u201ccontinue\u201d, the phrase \u201cin the opinion of the Governor in Council\u201d. This view is strengthened by reference to the circumstance that no method is provided for calling the matter to the attention of the Governor in Council, or for the manner in which the opinion is to be expressed or announced. If such had been the intent of the section, we cannot doubt that some procedure with reference to such matters would, in conformity with the legislative practice of the Parliament of Canada, have been laid down. There is not much difficulty as to the scope of the phrase \u201csale and traffic in intoxicating liquors.\u201d The heading of Part II of the Act is \u201cTraffic in Intoxicating Liquors.\u201d The sections of that Part (sections 118 to 127 inclusive) indicate very clearly that \u201ctraffic\u201d comprises commercial dealings in intoxicating liquor, including, not only the sale or barter of the same, but also the exposing or keeping for sale of such liquor, the sending, shipping, bringing, carrying of such liquor into the territory in which the prohibitions of the Act are operative, the delivery to any consignee or other person, or the storing, warehousing or keeping for delivery any such liquor so sent, shipped, brought or carried. These and similar matters seem to be the matters contemplated by the phrase \u201csale and traffic in intoxicating liquors.\u201d Such, it may be observed, are the matters in respect of which the prohibitions and restrictions of the Act are imposed. The probable intention would appear to be that it is in relation to such matters that the restrictiveness of the provincial laws is to be compared with the restrictiveness of the Canada Temperance Act.\nThe language employed does not suggest that the Legislature is envisaging a comparison between the feasibility or efficacy of the respective methods prescribed by the two systems of legislation for bringing the prohibitions and restrictions of the several enactments into operation. It was ingeniously argued that these last mentioned matters must be contemplated as subjects of comparison by reason of the reference to Part I of the Canada Temperance Act. But that reference is otherwise quite easily explicable. The prohibitions in Part II are conditionally expressed. The introductory words of section 118 are these:\nFrom the day on which this Part comes into force and takes effect in any county or city, and for so long thereafter as, and while the same continues or is in force therein, * * *\nThe enactment by virtue of which Part II comes into force, and by virtue of which the conditional prohibition takes effect, is to be found in Part I; and it was, no doubt, considered that, this enactment of Part I being the necessary complement of Part II, the omission of all reference to Part I in section 175 might leave that section incomplete and obscure. To compare, then, the respective systems of restriction created by the statutes, we have to consider: First of all, the provisions of Part II of the Canada Temperance Act may fairly be described as prohibitory; and it is, perhaps, better to quote here section 118 in full:\n118. From the day on which this Part comes into force and takes effect in any county or city, and for so long thereafter as, and while the same continues or is in force therein, no person shall, except as in this Part specially provided, by himself, his clerk, servant or agent,\n(a) expose or keep for sale, within such county or city, any intoxicating liquor;\n(b) directly or indirectly on any pretense or upon any device, within any such county or city, sell or barter, or, in consideration of the purchase of any other property, give to any other person any intoxicating liquor;\n(c) send, ship, bring or carry or cause to be sent, shipped, brought, or carried to or into any such county or city, any intoxicating liquor; or\n(d) deliver to any consignee or other person, or store, warehouse, or keep for delivery, any intoxicating liquor so sent, shipped, brought or carried.\n2. Paragraphs (c) and (d) of subsection one of this section shall not apply to any intoxicating liquor sent, shipped, brought or carried to any person or persons for his or their personal or family use, except it be so sent, shipped, brought or carried to be paid for in such county or city to the person delivering the same, his clerk, servant, or agent, or his master or principal, if the person delivering it is himself a servant or agent,\n3. No act done in violation of the provisions of this section shall be rendered lawful by reason of\n(a) any license issued to any distiller or brewer;\n(b) any license for retailing on board any steamboat or other vessel, brandy, rum, whiskey, or other spirituous liquors, wine, ale, beer, porter, cider or other vinous or fermented liquors;\n(c) any license for retailing on board any steamboat or other vessel, wine, ale, beer, porter, cider or other vinous or fermented liquors, but not brandy, rum, whiskey or other spirituous liquors; or\n(d) any license of any other description whatsoever.\nThere are certain exceptions in the subsequent sections of Part II. Provision is made, for example, for the sale of wine for sacramental purposes; for the sale of intoxicating liquor for exclusively medicinal purposes, and for use in good faith in some art, trade or manufacture; and then there are provisions authorizing the sale by licensed distillers and brewers within the area in which the prohibition is in force, as well as by wholesale merchants and traders on the condition that such sales shall be in quantities of not less than ten gallons at any one time, and then only to druggists and vendors specially licensed by the Lieutenant Governor in Council in the province, or to persons whom the seller has good reason to believe will forthwith carry the same beyond the limits of the territory in which the prohibition is in force.\nThere are also exceptions in relation to the purchase or sale by legally qualified chemists, physicians or druggists of officinal medical preparations, patent medicines, or for pharmaceutical preparations containing alcohol but not intended for use as beverage; of methylated spirits for pharmaceutical and mechanical uses; of spirituous liquors or alcohol for exclusively medicinal purposes; or for bona fide use of some trade, art or manufacture.\nTurning now to the Liquor Control Act of Ontario (R.S.O. 1927, ch. 257, as amended by the statutes of 1934, ch. 26). It is perfectly obvious from an inspection of its provisions that it does not aim at the prohibition of the sale and traffic in intoxicating liquors in the sense of the Canada Temperance Act. The purpose of the original Act was, broadly, to establish a government monopoly in the sale of liquor, but to provide, by means of government shops chiefly, liquor for sale which might be purchased by retail with virtually no limit as to quantity by persons possessing permits issued under the statute, which permits could be obtained upon the payment of a small fee by any resident of the province of twenty-one years of age.\nVery important changes were introduced by the statute of 1934, especially in relation to the permit system, and a multiplication of agencies for the sale of wine and beer. As we are only concerned with the statute as amended, we proceed at once to summarize the law as it now stands.\nA Board, known as the Liquor Control Board of Ontario, is constituted by the statute (section 3) and is charged with the administration of the Act, \u201cincluding the general control, management and supervision of all Government liquor stores.\u201d\nThe Board (section 9) is empowered to buy and sell liquor, to control the possession, sale, consumption, transportation and delivery of liquor in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the Regulations; to establish liquor stores; to make provision for the maintenance of warehouses for beer, wine or liquor; to grant, refuse, suspend and cancel permits for the purchase of liquor; to appoint officials to issue and grant permits under the Act; and generally to do all things which the Board may deem necessary or advisable for the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of the Act and the Regulations. The Board is empowered (section 10), with the approval of the Lieutenant Governor in Council, to make regulations not inconsistent with the statute, for carrying out the provisions of the Act, for the efficient administration thereof; and such regulations on publication in the Ontario Gazette shall have the same force as if enacted in the statute itself.\nTwo classes of permits are provided for (s. 37); individual permits and special permits. Individual permits are granted to individuals of the full age of 21 years having resided in the province for the period of at least one month immediately preceding the date of his making the application. Individual permits may be granted to non-residents for a period not exceeding one month. Special permits, when authorized by the regulations, may be granted to enable the applicant to purchase liquor for some specified purpose; and, by the Regulations (No. 8), permits of this character are authorized. But, for the purchase of beer and wine, no permit is necessary.\nBy section 37 (5) the Board is authorized so to provide by regulation, and Regulation No. 1 is in the following terms:\n1. A person other than the holder of an authority under the Act, unless he is prohibited by law or by a regulation or order of the Board, may under the supervision of the Board purchase beer, wine and native wine from a vendor, brewer, brewer\u2019s agent, or the holder of a Native Wine license as the case may be without any individual or special permit being necessary therefor, and beer, wine and native wine so purchased may be had, possessed, given and consumed in the residence of the purchaser.\nThen, in addition to Government stores, the Act, since the amendment of 1934, provides for a number of agencies through which liquor may be distributed. These are distillers, brewers, wineries, standard hotels and beverage rooms.\nBy section 51 of the Act, distillers may sell their products \u201cto the Board\u201d or \u201cas the Board may direct.\u201d\nBy section 45, brewers may be licensed:\n(a) to keep for sale and sell beer to the Board; (b) to deliver beer on the order of the Board or of a vendor to any person named in such order at the address therein stated.\n(c) to keep for sale and sell beer under the supervision and control of the Board and in accordance with this Act and the regulations.\nAnd, by force of Regulations Nos. 1 and 45 to 49, brewers may sell and keep for sale beer; and a brewer or brewer\u2019s agent may accept orders by telephone for the sale of beer, or to the holder of an authority under the Act, and may sell and deliver the beer so ordered.\nThere are similar provisions for the sale of native wines by the manufacturers thereof.\nThen, by section 69 (1) the Board may issue \u201cauthorities\u201d for the sale of beer and wine in standard hotels and in such other premises as the Regulations may provide and define. And, by Regulations 156 and 157, the Board may issue \u201cauthorities\u201d for the sale and consumption of beer and wine with meals in the dining rooms of standard hotels and clubs, in railway dining cars, in steamship dining rooms and in military messes; and of beer without meals in the beverage rooms of standard hotels, in clubs, in railway dining cars, in steamships and in military messes.\nThe Act, of course, contains very stringent provisions designed to prevent the sale of intoxicating liquor and the consumption of it otherwise than as authorized and permitted by the Act. Nevertheless, the enactment in its essence is an Act for regulating the sale and consumption of such liquor. It cannot be seriously argued that, in point of restrictiveness, any attempt is made to approach the prohibitory provisions of Part II of the Canada Temperance Act. The respective objects of the two enactments are in that respect opposed to one another. The one statute, speaking broadly, has for its object the prevention of commercial dealings in intoxicating liquor within the territory in which it is in force. The other makes provision for enabling the people to procure such liquor by the purchase of it through Government stores and the other agencies mentioned above.\nOn the argument counsel on behalf of the provinces of Ontario and Quebec raised the question of the constitutional validity of the Canada Temperance Act. Reading the Order of Reference in light of the decision in Russell v. The Queen[3] and of the judgment of the Judicial Committee on the Local Option Reference in 1896[4], we have no doubt that the interrogatories addressed to us ought not to be construed as involving any such question. At the request of counsel, we stated, however, that we should mention, in the judgment, the fact of the argument having been advanced; we now do so accordingly.\nThe conclusion seems to be that Interrogatory No. 1 must be answered in the negative; and, for the reasons already given, Interrogatory No. 2 should be answered in the affirmative.\nCannon J. (dissenting)\u2014I had the advantage of perusing the carefully prepared opinions of my Lord the Chief Justice and of my brother Crocket. I cannot escape the conclusion that Parliament has left to the Executive and the Secretary of State the enforcement of the Canada Temperance Act and that they must take the necessary steps to bring to the knowledge of these counties the enforcement, suspension, revocation or revival of the Act, from a given date to be published in the Canada Gazette through a proclamation of the Governor General in Council.\nIt is essential, specially in the case of a penal statute, that the subjects be notified of the date from which they are bound to obey it. It appears from sections 9, 10, 110, 116, 175 of the Canada Temperance Act that the time of the bringing into operation of the provisions of the statute, of their revocation or of their suspension, is, after certain formalities, to be fixed at the discretion of the Governor General in Council. A formal announcement, under the great seal, of what the Governor General in Council wishes to make known to the subjects is a proclamation. This was needed to fix a date for the suspension of the Act. It is also needed to fix a date from which the Act will again operate in these counties, if the Governor General in Council is satisfied and deems it advisable so to do. Parliament, in this instance, has left the necessary measure preliminary to the enforcement of the Act, its suspension and revival to the executive powers of the Crown, i.e., the Governor General in Council. Promulgation of an Act is not necessary when Parliament makes it enforceable on the day of its sanction, because all citizens are supposed to be present or represented in Parliament and, as a consequence, to know what takes place there; but when, as in this case, the commencement of the enforcement is conditional and requires a vote of the electors and a proclamation, the Act cannot be enforced without complying with those requirements and, specifically, without bringing to the knowledge of the citizens in the interested area, the date after which they must comply with its requirements.\nNow, section 23 of the Interpretation Act, R.S.C., 1927, ch. 1, enacts:\n23. When the Governor General is authorized to do any act by proclamation, such proclamation is understood to be a proclamation issued under an order of the Governor in Council; but it shall not be necessary that it be mentioned in the proclamation that it is issued under such order.\nWe may also apply, as a guiding principle in this matter of interpreting section 175 of the Canada Temperance Act, what is found in s. 31 (g) of the same Interpretation Act:\n31. In every Act, unless the contrary intention appears: * * * *\n(g) if a power is conferred to make any rules, regulations or by-laws, the power shall be construed as including a power, exercisable in the like manner, and subject to the like consent and conditions, if any, to rescind, revoke, amend or vary the rules, regulations or by-laws and make others;\nI cannot conceive that Parliament ever contemplated that the suspension of the Act would be discontinued not from a date to be fixed by proclamation of the Governor General in Council, but would be left to the possible divergent opinions of Justices of the Peace or Police Court judges, with the necessary resultant state of incertitude for the populations concerned. Parliament has directed that proclamations should be issued when the executive has to take action to put the Act in force in a given territorial division of Canada. Under section 31(e) of the Interpretation Act, \u201cif a power is conferred * * * the power may be exercised * * * from time to time as occasion requires.\u201d This is an occasion that requires that such powers as are necessary to enable the executive to enforce the revival of the Act \u201cshall be understood to be also given\u201d under sub-section (b) of the same section 31.\nI would, therefore, answer as follows the questions put to us:\nQUESTION 1\u2014Are the provincial laws respecting intoxicating liquor as restrictive since the coming into force of The Liquor Control Act of Ontario, as amended in 1934, as the Canada Temperance Act?\nAnswer: Ex facie, according to the wording of the Acts, the Provincial Act, as amended in 1934, is not more restrictive of the sale and traffic of intoxicating liquors qua the consumer; but it establishes and protects a monopoly and control of such sale and traffic within the Province under very drastic penalties. As to the actual working of the Acts, in the three counties interested, I am not in a position to answer this pure question of fact, having no elements before me to make any comparative study of results.\nQUESTION 2\u2014If the answer to Question 1 is in the negative, is Part II of the Canada Temperance Act in operation in the said counties of Perth, Huron and Peel?\nAnswer: No.\nQUESTION 3\u2014If the answer to Question 2 is in the negative, what procedure must be adopted to bring the said\nPart II into operation in the said counties?\nAnswer: A proclamation should be issued bringing to the knowledge of these counties the date fixed by Order in Council terminating the suspension of the Act.\nCrocket, J. (dissenting)\u2014With the greatest deference, I am of opinion that on the true construction of s. 175 of the Canada Temperance Act the question as to whether the laws of any province relating to the sale and traffic in intoxicating liquors are at any time as restrictive as the provisions of Parts I to IV of the Canada Temperance Act is a question for the determination of the Governor in Council and not for this or any other court.\nAs I read s. 175, as it stands in the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927, it empowers the Governor in Council, when a petition is received from the electors of any city or county in accordance with the provisions of ss. 112, 113 and 114, praying for the revocation of any Order in Council previously passed bringing Part II of the Canada Temperance Act into force in such city or county, to suspend, by order to be published in the Canada Gazette, the operation of the provisions of the Canada Temperance Act in such city or county without the polling of any votes for and against as required by ss. 112, 113 and 114, provided\nthe Governor in Council is of opinion that the laws of the Province in which such city or county is situated, relating to the sale and traffic in intoxicating liquors, are as restrictive as the provisions of Parts I to IV, both inclusive, of this Act;\nand enacts that, if and when an Order in Council is so passed and published, such suspension shall commence ten days after the date of the publication of such order and\ncontinue as long as the provincial laws continue as restrictive as aforesaid.\nIt will be observed that, while the Governor in Council is empowered to declare the suspension of the Act on the condition designated, the enactment itself provides when the suspension shall commence and how long it is to continue. The crucial question therefore is: What was the intention of Parliament as indicated by the words of the enactment \u201cto continue as long as the provincial laws continue as restrictive as aforesaid?\u201d\nIt seems to me to be manifest that, when read in connection with the antecedent text of the section, as, of course, they must be, the last words must be taken to intend, in the event of the provincial liquor laws being altered after the publication of an Order in Council suspending the operation of the Canada Temperance Act in any city or county, so as to render them less restrictive than the provisions of the Canada Temperance Act, that the suspension should continue until it is so adjudged and declared by some competent authority. Otherwise it would be quite unintelligible. It would be impossible for anyone to know whether the Canada Temperance Act was or was not in force in a city or county at any time or whether the provincial liquor laws were or were not in force.\nAssuredly Parliament did not intend that the suspension should automatically cease upon the passage and coming into force of any provincial legislation in any way amending the provincial liquor laws, for it has plainly indicated that the suspension shall continue \u201cso long as the provincial laws continue as restrictive as the provisions of the Canada Temperance Act It is this provision which on its very face necessitates an adjudication by some authority at some time as to whether the provincial laws have ceased to be as restrictive in comparison with the provisions of the Canada Temperance Act as when the suspension of the latter Act was proclaimed. Is it to be supposed that it was intended by Parliament that such adjudication should be made by this Court or by the Supreme Courts of the different provinces? I cannot for a moment think so. Is it to be supposed that it intended that it should be left to a Police or Stipendiary Magistrate or to two Justices of the Peace to make the adjudication on such a question before issuing his or their warrant or summons charging an alleged offender with a violation of any one or more of the provisions of the Canada Temperance Act, the operation of which has been declared by the Governor in Council to have been suspended? I cannot, for my part, read the last words of the section in connection with its preceding text, to which the concluding words themselves expressly refer, as denoting an intention that the life of an Order of the Governor in Council suspending the operation of such an Act as the Canada Temperance Act in a city or county with all its provisions for the prosecution and punishment of offenders by fine and imprisonment should depend upon the view of a local Police or Stipendiary Magistrate as to the relative restrictive character of the provisions of that Act and the provisions of the provincial liquor laws. That, however, it seems to me, must be the result if the phrase \u201cto continue as long as the provincial laws continue as restrictive as aforesaid\u201d is to be construed, standing by itself, according to its strict grammatical meaning, without reference to the text of the whole enactment, as excluding the power of the Governor in Council to rescind or cancel all or any of the suspension orders he has made under the provisions of s. 175, upon the occurrence of the condition which calls for such action.\nThe reasonable and logical interpretation, in my view, is that Parliament, having empowered the Governor in Council to make the suspension order, if satisfied that the provincial liquor laws were as restrictive as the provisions of the Canada Temperance Act, that order should continue in force until it should be rescinded or revoked in the usual manner by the Governor in Council who made it, when in the opinion of the Governor in Council the provisions of the provincial laws should cease to be as restrictive as the provisions of the Canada Temperance Act. That is the interpretation which the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick placed upon it in November, 1927, when required, in the special stated case of Sheehan v. Shaw[5], to construe it in order to determine whether the Canada Temperance Act was then in force in the County of Carleton, in which county the Governor in Council had declared its suspension. Any other construction would leave both the federal and provincial liquor laws in such a state of confusion and uncertainty as to practically destroy their efficacy, and create such an anomaly in the practice governing the making and rescinding of Orders in Council and their promulgation as well as in the application and enforcement of the criminal and quasi-criminal laws of the country as could not well be imputed to the intention of Parliament.\nI entirely concur in the interpretation which the Court of Appeal of the Province of New Brunswick placed on the enactment in question in 1927 in Sheehan v. Shaw5 and in its conclusion, as stated by Sir Douglas Hazen, the learned Chief Justice of that Court, that the question as to whether the liquor laws of any province were as restrictive as the provisions of the Canada Temperance Act is one for the decision of the Governor in Council on the recommendation of the Secretary of State and not for the decision of the Supreme Court of such province, and that the suspension of the operation of the provisions of that Act, as declared by the Governor in Council, must be held to continue in force until it is cancelled or dealt with by the Governor in Council. Though the concluding phrase does not expressly say so, I think the whole section clearly implies it. It is certainly not incapable of being read in a way which will avoid such a patent anomaly as that which must result from the suggested alternative interpretation, without doing any violence to the grammatical meaning of the quoted phrase with which the section ends. The highest courts throughout the Empire have again and again held that certain words must be understood as intended to be incorporated in statutory enactments notwithstanding that the enactments have not expressly used them. Indeed, I think it will be found that, generally speaking, whenever adherence to the strictly grammatical meaning of isolated phrases in a statutory enactment leads to a patent absurdity or repugnance, they have never hesitated to discard the strictly grammatical meaning by reading into the enactment such words as will make it intelligible and reasonable, as being necessarily understood or implied.\nThe decision of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick has never been challenged during the seven or eight years which have since elapsed, with the result that in the majority of the counties of that province where the Canada Temperance Act was formerly in force, the provisions of the New Brunswick Intoxicating Liquor Act have consistently been enforced in all those counties as well as in the other counties of New Brunswick as the recognized law of the entire province, many alleged offenders having in the meantime been punished by heavy pecuniary fines and severe imprisonment penalties under the provisions of the last mentioned Act.\nWe are now asked by the Governor in Council to re-open this most important question on this reference. The formal order of reference sets forth the effect of the decision of the Court of Appeal of New Brunswick in the case referred to and, singularly enough, states that \u201cconsiderable legal opinion, including that of the Department of Justice, is in conflict with the decision of the Court of Appeal in New Brunswick.\u201d\nBeing of opinion, for the reasons already stated, that it is entirely a question for the decision of the Governor in Council on the recommendation of the Secretary of State as a matter of governmental responsibility, I respectfully beg to be excused from answering Interrogatory No. 1.\nInterrogatory No. 2 is one which clearly falls within the terms of s. 55 (b) of the Supreme Court Act, concerning, as it does, the interpretation of an enactment of the Dominion Parliament, and involves no intervention by this Court in the exercise of governmental responsibility. Whether Interrogatory No. 1 be answered by other members of the Court in the affirmative or in the negative, I should, for the reasons already stated, answer Interrogatory No. 2 in the negative.\nTo Interrogatory No. 3 my answer is: By rescinding the Orders in Council suspending the operation of the Canada Temperance Act in the counties named, if the Governor in Council is satisfied that the provisions of the liquor laws of Ontario are not as restrictive as those of the Canada Temperance Act, and promulgating the rescinding orders in the usual manner.\nQuestion No. 1 answered in the negative.

(ad hoc).\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA EN BANC\nCriminal law\u2014Theft\u2014Shipping\u2014Customs Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 42 (as amended), ss. 207, 151, 2 (o)\u2014Vessel hovering within territorial waters of Canada with dutiable goods on board\u2014Pursuit by police cruiser\u2014Continuity of pursuit\u2014Seizure of vessel on high seas\u2014Forcible escape of vessel\u2014Forfeiture of vessel\u2014Time of forfeiture\u2014Charge of theft against master\u2014Form of charge.\nThe schooner K., of Canadian registry, of which appellant was master, while \u201chovering within the territorial waters of Canada\u201d off the shores of Cape Breton with a cargo of liquor on board (dutiable in Canada), was approached by a Canadian police cruiser, and proceeded towards the high seas. It was overhauled within the territorial waters and summoned to \u201cheave to in the King\u2019s name,\u201d but before it could be boarded it resumed its course. The cruiser pursued for a short distance, then turned, picked up its boat which had been lowered for boarding, and hurried towards shore for about eight miles, then took bearings and received instructions by radio, and returned to the pursuit and overhauled and stopped the K. on the high seas about 35 miles from shore. Here its officers boarded the K., asked appellant what cargo he had, were told in answer \u201ca bit of liquor,\u201d asked to see and did see the manifest and shipping papers, and without further examination took the K. in charge and towed it back to a point within three miles of shore, where appellant, on some claim of navigation dangers to his vessel, forcibly took charge of the K.\u2019s helm, turned it out of its course, thereby breaking the tow lines, and sailed away. The cruiser did not pursue. At trial appellant was convicted of theft of the schooner and theft of its cargo.\nHeld: The K., at the time when appellant took it away from the officers, was lawfully under seizure and in control of the officers, and the convictions of theft must stand (Judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc, 9 M.P.R. 97, affirmed). The effect of ss. 207, 151 and 2 (o) of the Customs Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 42, as amended), when applied to the facts of this case, is that, by hovering in territorial waters of Canada with dutiable goods on board, the K. thereby became forfeited by operation of law. When the presence of liquor in its cargo was established as a fact, the forfeiture related back to the time of the hovering. The forfeiture was the legal unescapable consequence of the commission of the offence. The seizing on the high seas was part of the prolonged or continued act, which, begun within the territorial waters, and there temporarily frustrated by the K.\u2019s flight, was consummated on the high seas; and the temporary abandonment of the pursuit was not such an abandonment as broke the continuity of the pursuit.\nObjection on the ground that, according to the charge, the vessel taken by appellant was one which had \u201cbeen seized and detained on suspicion by * * * as forfeited,\u201d was rejected. The words, \u201csuspicion,\u201d etc., were unnecessary, and when deleted left the allegation as being \u201cseized * * * as forfeited,\u201d which phrase falls within the definition \u201cseized and forfeited\u201d within s. 2 (o) of the Act.\nAPPEAL by the accused from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc[1], affirming (Mellish and Carroll JJ. dissenting) his conviction, on trial before Doull J. with a jury, for theft of a schooner and theft of its cargo. (Accused was also convicted of obstructing a public officer in the execution of his duty, which conviction was affirmed by the said Court en banc. Accused appealed thereon to this Court with regard to the sentence). The accused was master of the vessel in question and the alleged theft was in taking it away from the officers of a Royal Canadian Mounted Police cruiser when, it was alleged, it was lawfully under seizure and in the control of those officers. The questions in issue turned on the meaning and effect of certain provisions of the Customs Act. The material facts of the case and questions in issue are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was dismissed.\nW. P. Potter for the appellant.\nG. McL. Daley K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDysart J. (ad hoc)\u2014This appeal from the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia affirming the conviction of the appellant on three charges\u2014(1) theft of a schooner, (2) theft of the cargo of the vessel, and (3) obstructing a public officer in the discharge of his duty\u2014turns on the meaning and effect of certain provisions of the Customs Act, R.S.C. 1927, ch. 42, and amendments. The dissent on which this appeal is based, opens up the whole case on the charges of theft.\nIn the early morning of December 6, 1933, the schooner Kromhout, of Canadian registry, of which the appellant was master, was \u201chovering within the territorial waters of Canada\u201d off the shores of Cape Breton, with a cargo of liquor on board. When the Royal Canadian Mounted Police cruiser, No. 4, which had been lying in wait, approached her, the Kromhout started up her engines, and, with set sails, proceeded towards the high seas, but was overhauled before she got beyond the territorial waters and was summoned to \u201cheave to in the King\u2019s name\u201d\u2014a summons she obeyed only after a few shots were fired across her bows. A boat was lowered from the cruiser, and officers thereof set out to row to the schooner, but, before the boat got well away, the Kromhout resumed her course towards the high seas. The cruiser pursued for a short distance, and then, turning about, picked up the boat and hurried towards shore for a distance of about eight miles, where, after taking bearings and receiving radio instructions, she returned to the pursuit, and about noon hour overhauled the Kromhout on the high seas, about thirty-five miles from shore. Here the schooner was stopped, boarded, and, after some discussion, was taken in charge by the cruiser\u2019s men, and towed back to a point within three miles of the shore. At this point the accused, on some pretence of navigation dangers to his vessel, forcibly took charge of the helm of the Kromhout, turned her out of her course, thereby breaking the tow lines, and sailed away. This time the cruiser did not pursue. By arrangement, the vessel and crew were later, near the French colony of St. Pierre, surrendered to Canadian officers without prejudice to their rights.\nWhen the cruiser\u2019s officers boarded the schooner on the high seas, they asked the accused what cargo he had and were told, \u201ca bit of liquor.\u201d They asked to see the manifest and shipping papers, and did see them, but these were in French and not fully understood. They made no further examination of the vessel or of the cargo or of the accused. The vessel, as a matter of fact, had on board seven hundred and fifty-one kegs of rum which were dutiable in Canada.\nUpon these facts the accused was tried at Halifax, N.S., before Doull J. with a jury, and convicted on the three counts mentioned, and sentenced to three years\u2019 imprisonment on each count, the sentences to run concurrently. This conviction was upheld on appeal, Mellish and Carroll JJ. dissenting. The jurisdiction of the trial court in cases such as this to deal with offences committed on the high seas, is conferred by s. 656 of the Criminal Code.\nOn this appeal we have to determine whether or not the Kromhout when the accused took her away from the police officers, was lawfully under seizure and in the control of those officers. The language of the charge is that the accused committed the theft by unlawfully taking the Kromhout openly and with force\nwithout the permission of * * * the person who seized the same, or some competent authority and before the said vessel had been declared by competent authority to have been seized without due cause, the said vessel having been seized and detained on suspicion by the said Moyle A. Hyson, a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, as forfeited under section 207 of the Customs Act.\nThe provisions of the Customs Act by which this case is governed are not confined to s. 207\u2014they include other provisions which may now be set out, so far as necessary. By section 151,\nIf any vessel is hovering in territorial waters of Canada, any officer may go on board such vessel and examine her cargo and may also examine the master or person in command upon oath touching the cargo and voyage and may bring the vessel into port (Subs. 1).\nSuch vessel \u201cshall proceed to come to a stop when required so to do in the King\u2019s name by any officer\u201d (Subs. 2); and upon such vessel\u2019s \u201cfailing to proceed to come to a stop when required,\u201d the captain or master of the Government cruiser may, after first causing a gun to be fired as a signal, fire at or into such vessel (Subs. 3). Further particulars of the rights and powers of such revenue officers in dealing with such a vessel are set out in subs. 8. Section 207 reads:\u2014\nIf upon the examination by any officer of the cargo of any vessel hovering in territorial waters of Canada, any dutiable goods or any goods the importation of which into Canada is prohibited are found on board, such vessel with her apparel, rigging, tackle, furniture, stores and cargo shall be seized and forfeited * * *\nThe term \u201chovering\u201d is not defined by the Act, but is a term understood by mariners to mean something like fluttering about, neither coming nor going, in an undecided manner. The term \u201cterritorial waters of Canada,\u201d so far as applicable to this case, means the waters \u201cwithin twelve marine miles\u201d of the Dominion of Canada (s. 151 (7)). \u201cOfficer\u201d means an officer of customs (s. 2 (l)). By s. 2 (o)\n\u201cseized and forfeited,\u201d \u201cliable to forfeiture\u201d or \u201csubject to forfeiture,\u201d or any other expression which might of itself imply that some act subsequent to the commission of the offence is necessary to work the forfeiture, shall not be construed as rendering any such subsequent act necessary, but the forfeiture shall accrue at the time and by the commission of the offence, in respect of which the penalty or forfeiture is imposed.\nSection 143 was also referred to, but really adds nothing to sections 151 and 207. It seems to have been assumed that a cargo of rum was dutiable goods in Canada and that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police cruiser and men were acting in discharge of public duty.\nThe effect of the foregoing provisions, when applied to the facts of this case, is that by hovering in territorial waters of Canada with dutiable goods on board, the Kromhout thereby became forfeited by operation of law. Proof of the forfeiture itself was established after the offence had been committed, that is, when the officers stopped and boarded the Kromhout and ascertained from the captain (the master) that dutiable goods were on board. The fact of hovering was established beyond peradventure by the general finding of the jury under quite proper directions. The seizing of the Kromhout on the high seas was part of the prolonged or continued act, which, begun within the territorial waters, and there temporarily frustrated by the flight of the schooner, was consummated on the high seas; and the temporary abandonment of the pursuit of the schooner by the cruiser was not such an abandonment as broke the continuity of the pursuit. When the presence of liquor in the schooner\u2019s cargo was established as a fact, the forfeiture which followed as a matter of law related back to the time of the hovering in territorial waters. The authority given to officers to stop and board vessels and examine them and their cargoes is intended for no other purpose than to establish whether or not an offence has in fact been committed. The forfeiture itself is not brought about by any act of officers, but is the legal unescapable consequence of the commission of the offence. A failure to establish that liquor was on board a vessel so hovering, would not mean that the offence had not been committed, but that the commission had not been proved.\nIt is objected that the charge is defective in that it alleges that the accused took a vessel that had \u201cbeen seized and detained on suspicion * * * as forfeited.\u201d This objection, however, seems to be rather technical, and not of the substance of the matter. The words \u201csuspicion,\u201d etc., were really quite unnecessary and when deleted leave the allegation as being \u201cseized * * * as forfeited,\u201d and this phrase, I think, falls within the definition \u201cseized and forfeited\u201d within s. 2 (o).\nSome complaint has also been made that the charge of the trial judge was not correct, but I find nothing in it that can properly be objected to in substance.\nOn the charges of theft, therefore, conviction must stand.\nOn the remaining charge\u2014obstructing officers\u2014the conviction itself is not in dispute. As to the sentence, it is not perfectly clear that the dissenting judges held it to be illegal. Mr. Justice Mellish says, \u201cI think it is excessive\u201d. Unless they dissented on the ground that it was illegal, this court has no jurisdiction to deal with the matter. Our jurisdiction is strictly limited to controversies in relation to some question of law on which there has been dissent. Whatever may be the proper construction of the judgments of Mr. Justice Mellish and Mr. Justice Carroll on this point, we think, since the sentence under the conviction upon the charge of obstruction runs concurrently with that under the conviction on the charges of theft, no useful purpose could be served by modifying it, although we are disposed to agree that, even if not illegal, it is excessive.\nThe appeal should be dismissed and the conviction affirmed.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W. P. Potter.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W. Stuart Edwards.\n[1] 9 M.P.R. 97; [1935] 2 D.L.R. 161.\n",

(ad hoc).\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW BRUNSWICK, APPEAL DIVISION\nEstoppel\u2014Accounts for supply of electric current\u2014Accounts rendered for too small amounts\u2014Action for balance\u2014Acts by defendant as result of accounts rendered\u2014Whether defence of estoppel precluded by Public Utilities Act, R.S.N.B. 1927, c. 127\u2014Applicability of estoppel on general principles.\nPlaintiff, a public utility within the Public Utilities Act, R.S.N.B. 1927, c. 127, sold and delivered electric current to the defendant dairy company, which (as known to plaintiff) used it in the manufacture of its products. Through mistake by plaintiff\u2019s employees, the amount of current supplied to defendant was wrongly determined on the meter dial readings, so that plaintiff rendered monthly accounts (which were paid) for only one-tenth of the current actually supplied. Defendant bought its cream at prices based on the difference between the market prices of its products and the cost of manufacturing them, and, believing in the correctness of plaintiff\u2019s accounts as rendered, relied upon them in reckoning up its cost of manufacture, and consequently paid for cream amounts substantially larger than it would have paid had plaintiff\u2019s accounts been correct. Plaintiff was not charged with negligence, nor with knowledge of defendant\u2019s method of fixing cream prices. After discovering its error, plaintiff sued for balance of account, and defendant pleaded estoppel. The said Public Utilities Act, s. 16, requires that no public utility shall charge a greater or less compensation for any service than is prescribed in established schedules, and the Act provides penalties for \u201cunjust discrimination\u201d or for charging \u201cby any device\u201d more or less than full compensation at scheduled rates.\nHeld: (1) The defence of estoppel was not precluded by the Act (Burkinshaw v. Nicolls, 3 App. Cas. 1004, and other cases, cited). (2) Estoppel was applicable to the case and afforded an effective defence. Plaintiff must be taken to have intended and expected that defendant would act upon plaintiff\u2019s representations in the ordinary course of defendant\u2019s business; and defendant did so act, reasonably and in a way that should not be taken as unusual, in the ordinary course of its business, to its detriment, in paying larger amounts for cream than it would otherwise have paid. (Principles of estoppel discussed, and cases referred to).\nJudgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division, 8 M.P.R. 67, reversed.\nAPPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division[1], dismissing its appeal from the judgment of Richards J.[2] in favour of the plaintiff for $1,931.82, being the amount by which the total of certain accounts, as rendered by plaintiff to defendant and paid by defendant, for electric energy supplied by plaintiff to defendant and used (as known to plaintiff) by defendant in its manufacture of dairy products, fell short of the total of the accounts that, according to the amount of electric energy actually supplied, should have been rendered. The further material facts and circumstances of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported, and are indicated in the above headnote.\nSpecial leave to appeal to this Court was granted to the defendant by the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick.\nThe appeal to this Court was allowed and the action dismissed with costs throughout.\nP. J. Hughes, K.C., for the appellant.\nJ. J. F. Winslow, K.C., for the respondent. The judgment of the court was delivered by\nDysart, J. (ad hoc)\u2014The question to be decided here is whether, in the circumstances of this case, a public utility company is entitled to collect a balance of accounts for electricity which it sold and delivered to a customer, or whether it is to be estopped from so collecting because of a mistake it made when, in rendering the accounts in the first instance, it understated the quantity of electricity, upon which mistake the customer relied and acted to its detriment.\nThe facts of the case are not in dispute. Most of them are set forth in a statement signed by counsel and filed at the trial. Both companies carry on business at Fredericton, N.B. The Dairy Company (appellant) buys cream and manufactures it into various dairy products. These products it sells at market prices, and buys its cream at prices based on the difference between the market prices of the manufactured products and the cost of manufacturing them. The manufacturing costs include the cost of motive power which is derived from electric current. The Electric Company (respondent) is a public utility, under the control and supervision of the Board of Commissioners of Public Utilities of the Province, and sells and distributes electric current to customers including the Dairy Company. To measure the quantity of electric current so supplied, the Electric Company installed on the premises of the Dairy Company an electric meter which, while satisfying in every respect the requirements of the Electricity Inspection Act of the Province, was one of a type which records on its dials only part of the current passing through it\u2014a type in common use with this and other such electric companies. In order to determine the exact amount of current passing through this meter, the dial readings should have been multiplied by ten. By some unexplained oversight or mistake on the part of the Electric Company\u2019s employees, the monthly readings of the meter dials were not so multiplied, and in consequence of that omission monthly accounts were rendered for only one-tenth the amount of current actually sold and delivered. This mistake in accounts continued for twenty-nine consecutive months, until, in April, 1932, the company discovered its error, and demanded payment of the remaining nine-tenths of the electric current, the price of which at the scheduled rates totalled $1,931.82.\nBefore the mistake was discovered, the Dairy Company, believing in the correctness of the accounts as rendered, relied upon them in reckoning up the costs of manufacture, and consequently in fixing the price of cream, and paying for cream amounts substantially larger than it would have paid had the electric bills been correctly stated. The good faith of the Dairy Company in so believing and acting is not impugned. The responsibility for the mistake admittedly rests solely on the Electric Company, but the company is not charged with negligence in committing the error nor with knowledge of the Dairy Company\u2019s method of fixing cream prices.\nIn the action for the balance of account, the foregoing facts were admitted, and the defence of estoppel was set up. The learned trial judge, Richards J., in a considered judgment[3] held that the principles of estoppel as enunciated in Carr v. London & N.W. Ry. Co.[4] could not properly be applied to this case because the Electric Company could not reasonably be deemed to have intended that the Dairy Company should act upon the misrepresentations in the particular way in which the latter company did act. This judgment in favour of the Electric Company was on appeal to the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of the Province[5] upheld on much the same reasoning.\nTo meet the defence of estoppel in this Court, the Electric Company,3 adopts the reasons of the trial judge, that on general principles estoppel is not applicable to the case, and,4 that even if estoppel were applicable apart from statute, it is barred or precluded by the Public Utilities Act. It will be convenient to deal with the second of these grounds first.\nIn order to get a clear view of the effect of the immediately relevant sections of the Public Utilities Act (R.S. N.B. 1927, ch. 127), it will be helpful to sketch briefly the general scope of the whole enactment. The Act authorizes the creation of a \u201cBoard of Commissioners of Public Utilities\u201d which is to \u201chave general supervision of all public utilities and shall make all necessary examinations and inquiries and keep itself informed as to the compliance by public utilities with the provisions\u201d of the Act (s. 5). All public utilities, including by definition such companies as the Electric Company (s. 2), are on their part required to make annual and other reports or returns to the Board giving such information as to their operation and conduct and otherwise as may be required of them by the Board, (s. 11). By section 10:\u2014\n10. Every public utility shall furnish reasonably adequate service and facilities. All charges made by a public utility shall be reasonable and just, and every unjust or unreasonable charge is prohibited and declared unlawful.\nThe rates, tolls and charges, to be lawful, must be such as are filed in schedules with the Board where they are open to public inspection (s. 14), and are subject to such changes therein as may be from time to time authorized by the Board. Section 16 is of vital importance. It reads:\u2014\n16. No public utility shall charge, demand, collect or receive a greater or less compensation for any service, than is prescribed in such schedules as are at the time established, or demand, collect or receive any rates, tolls or charges not specified in such schedules.\nFor \u201cunjust discrimination,\u201d and for charging \u201cby any device\u201d more or less than full compensation at scheduled rates, penalties are provided against utility companies and their customers (ss. 18 and 19).\nThe Act seems, therefore, to seek to control all public utilities for the general benefit of the public, expressly declaring that fair and reasonable service shall be rendered by the utilities, at rates, tolls and charges that are approved by the Board and are known or notified to the public. Section 16 in particular commands that the company shall charge full compensation at scheduled rates for all its service, and expressly prohibits any deviation from charging the full amount of compensation. By \u201ccompensation\u201d is surely meant, that the whole amount of service rendered is to be charged for and paid at the scheduled rates. Applied to the present case, the Act imposes a duty on the Electric Company to charge, and on the Dairy Company to pay, at scheduled rates, for all the electric current supplied by the one and used by the other, during the twenty-nine months in question.\nThe specific question for determination here is, can the duty so cast by statute upon both parties to this action, be defeated or avoided by a mere mistake in the computation of accounts?\nWe have not been referred to any English or Canadian cases, and we know of none, dealing directly with a case like the present. There are various decisions, especially in England, on varying aspects of the problem of how far duties imposed by public or private statutes on persons or corporations may be avoided. The general trend of the decisions seems to be that such duty cannot be avoided by a contract between the parties nor by any course of action that does not, at least squarely, raise estoppel. Each decision must be studied with reference to the particular statute on which it turns, and the circumstances with which it deals.\nIn Ayr Harbour Trustees v. Oswald[6], it was held that public trustees, on whom a statute imposed a duty to take land for public harbour purposes, could not fetter the freedom of themselves or their successors in dealing with such land so taken, by any resolution or purpose of their own, however commendable. In Islington Vestry v. Hornsey Urban Council[7], a municipal corporation was held not to be prevented from exercising its full powers by any arrangement or acquiescence on its part respecting the exercise of those powers. Again in York Corporation v. Leetham[8], the Commissioners empowered by statute to manage navigation and collect on the tonnage of cargoes \u201cthe tolls and rates by this Act directed to be taken, and no others\u201d was held not prevented by a contract from collecting tolls. The Queen v. Blenkinsop[9] was a case in which a municipal corporation under a mistake of law omitted to demand from a railway company the full amount of taxes owing. After several years\u2019 omission, it was held that the municipal corporation was not prevented or estopped from collecting the arrears. In none of these cases do the elements of estoppel appear. In the last mentioned case there was neither a representation nor change of position.\nThe English Companies Act, 1867, imposed a duty or obligation on companies to collect in cash the full face amount of the shares issued and a correlative duty on the holder of the shares to pay in full. It specifically provided that\nEvery Share in any Company shall be deemed and taken to have been issued and to be held subject to the Payment of the whole Amount thereof in Cash, unless the same shall have been otherwise determined by a Contract duly made in Writing, and filed with the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies at or before the Issue of such Shares. (s. 25).\nEvery share certificate is prima facie evidence of title, and is transferable but not negotiable. It amounts to a representation to all the world that the person who is named in it is the registered holder of the shares mentioned therein, and that the shares are paid-up to the extent therein mentioned; and it is given with the intention that it may be used as such a declaration: 5 Halsbury, 2nd Ed., s. 459.\nNotwithstanding the statutory duties and obligations so imposed by the said Act in reference to share certificates, companies were frequently estopped from showing that the statements contained in their certificates were not true. In Burkinshaw v. Nicolls[10], certificates of shares of the company were issued as \u201cfully paid-up\u201d and transferred to a holder for value without notice that the shares were not in fact fully paid. The company was held estopped from collecting the unpaid balances. At pages 1026 and 1027 Lord Blackburn used this language:\u2014\nNow in the present case the company has issued under the seal of the company a certificate in the form which is set out in the case, in which the company has asserted that these shares have been fully paid up. These certificates are issued under the directions of the Act of Parliament, and are made prima facie evidence of all that they state; only prima facie evidence.\nIn Bloomenthal v. Ford[11] certificates for \u201cfully paid-up\u201d shares were issued to the allottee by a company as security for a loan from him, he believing that they were \u201cfully paid-up.\u201d In a winding up, the liquidator was estopped from denying these certificates. Parbury\u2019s case[12] was another case of certificates issued for \u201cfully paid-up\u201d shares to an allottee, and again the company was estopped. The allottee had given the money to a third person to pay for the shares and believed that the money had been so applied. Where, however, the allottee had notice the shares were not fully paid, the company was not estopped. In re London Celluloid Co.[13].\nThe reasons or principles upon which these cases proceed is well stated by Bowen L.J. in In re London Celluloid Co.13, supra, at pp. 204 and 205, where he discusses the Act and the Burkinshaw v. Nicolls case[14] supra:\nNothing can be clearer than this, there is a statutory liability to pay the whole amount in cash, which can only be avoided under the statute in one way\u2014by a registered contract. Can there be any other way of escape? Only this, that if the company has so acted as to preclude itself from denying that the Act has been complied with, that is conclusive evidence that the Act has been complied with. The company may represent to third persons, and induce them to act on the faith of the representation, that the shares have been paid up in cash. If such a representation is made by the company, and acted on by third parties, who have no notice that it is untrue, the company cannot afterwards say that the shares have not been fully paid up. An estoppel of that kind operates against the liquidator as well as against the company, and in such a case the holders of the shares are not liable for calls. Burkinshaw v. Nicolls[15] shews that such an estoppel may arise. The Act is not thereby evaded, but there is evidence, which must be taken as conclusive, that its requisitions have been complied with. The decision in that case was a ruling on a point of evidence, and it is dangerous to turn a ruling on a point of evidence into a rule of law. The company had issued certificates stating that the shares in question were fully paid up, they were sold in the ordinary course of business, and the House of Lords held that the purchasers were entitled to rely on the certificates as sufficient evidence that the shares were fully paid up;\nIn the cases of debentures issued by companies without authority or power to make the issue, companies issuing them may be estopped, as against innocent holders for value without notice, from denying the truth of the representations contained on the face of the bonds: Webb v. The Commissioners of Heme Bay[16]. And the same result has been reached where the representations, on which the purchaser of bonds relied to his detriment, are contained in the recitals of the bond: Horton v. Westminster Improvement Commissioners[17]. In cases of annuities and gratuities authorized or prescribed by statute to be paid to certain classes of annuitants or beneficiaries, it has been held that where, through a mistake in classification or otherwise, compensation has been made in excess of the authorized amounts, the excess cannot be recovered, if there has been delay on the part of the officials, and change of position on the part of the recipients of the fund: Skyring v. Greenwood[18]; Holt v. Markham[19]. In this latter case there was a delay of only a few months but it was sufficient, in the opinion of Warrington L.J. (p. 512), to entitle the recipient to conclude that payment was authorized \u201cand that he was at liberty to deal with the money as he pleased.\u201d The gratuitant had \u201cavailed himself of that liberty and spent the whole or a large part of the gratuity which had been paid him, and [was now no longer] in a position to repay it.\u201d\nThe foregoing cases show that, however imperative may be a statutory duty, the proof of any alleged violation thereof must be made in accordance with the established rules of evidence, and that by one of these rules\u2014that is, estoppel\u2014claims, otherwise sound, may not be susceptible to proof at all. As Bowen, L.J., said in In re London Celluloid Co.[20] supra at page 205 already quoted, \u201cif the company has so acted as to preclude itself from denying that the Act has been complied with, that is conclusive evidence that the Act has been complied with\u201d; and again on the same page, \u201cthe Act is not thereby evaded, but there is evidence, which must be taken as conclusive, that its requisitions have been complied with.\u201d The same learned judge in Low v. Bouverie[21], says at page 105:\nBut we must be guarded in the way in which we understand the remedy where there is an estoppel. Estoppel is only a rule of evidence; you cannot found an action upon estoppel. Estoppel is only important as being one step in the progress towards relief on the hypothesis that the defendant is estopped from denying the truth of something which he has said.\nAnd at page 106:\nNow, an estoppel, that is to say, the language upon which the estoppel is founded, must be precise and unambiguous. That does not necessarily mean that the language must be such that it cannot possibly be open to different constructions, but that it must be such as will be reasonably understood in a particular sense by the person to whom it is addressed.\nThere are, so far as we know, no decisions of Canadian courts bearing on directly the point in issue here. The few indirect decisions that are reported are based on tort for misrepresentation or misquotation by the railway companies of freight rates, and consequently are of little or no assistance to us.\nIn the United States there are many decisions, some of which have been strongly pressed upon us in argument. These decisions, of the Supreme Court of the United States and of several State Courts, deal with section 6 of the Interstate Commerce Act relating to the carriage of freight and passengers. Section 6 of that Act is, in effect, the same as section 16 of the Public Utilities Act of New Brunswick, but descends into more particularity. It reads in part:\n* * * nor shall any carrier charge or demand or collect or receive a greater or less or different compensation for such transportation of passengers or property, * * * than the rates, fares, and charges which are specified in the tariff filed and in effect at the time; * * *\nThe decisions need not be referred to in detail. Most of them are conveniently assembled in 83 Am. Law Rep. (annotated), pp. 245-268, and show that the duty to charge and collect full compensation under the Act is absolute, and is not subject to any relaxation or variation in any circumstance whatsoever. They deny that estoppel or other rules of evidence can affect the statutory obligation, and that no amount of harshness in consequences can affect this result. The underlying principles of the construction so placed upon that statute are well stated by Rugg, Chief Justice of Massachusetts, in the case of New York, New Haven, & Hartford Railroad Co. v. York & Whitney Co.[22]. The learned Chief Justice says:\nThe reason why there must be inflexibility in the enforcement of the published rate against all and every suggestion for relaxation rests upon the practical impossibility otherwise of maintaining equality between all shippers without preferential privileges of any sort. The rate when published becomes established by law. It can be varied only by law, and not by act of the parties. The regulation by Congress of interstate commerce rates takes that subject out of the realm of ordinary contract in some respects, and places it upon the rigidity of a quasi statutory enactment. The public policy thus declared supersedes the ordinary doctrine of estoppel, so far as that would interfere with the accomplishment of the dominant purpose of the Act. It does not permit that inequality of rates to arise indirectly through the application of estoppel, which it was the aim of the Act to suppress directly.\nWe know of no reason why public policy in New Brunswick should demand so rigid a rule of construction of the Public Utilities Act of that province. We see no reason why section 16 of that Act should not be construed in the spirit in which the Companies Act and other such Acts in England are construed. The section in conjunction with others of the Act, imposes a duty which cannot be avoided \u201cby contract\u201d nor \u201cby any device.\u201d It aims, we think, to prevent all \u201cunjust discrimination\u201d and all dishonest evasion. At the same time, there is nothing to suggest that it ought not to be construed in the light of the law of the land, and enforced in courts according to the prevailing law as to evidence and procedure. When viewed in this way, it does not preclude estoppel which, as we have seen, is only a rule of evidence available in courts, and when applied may assist in ascertaining that the statute has been not evaded but fully met in its requirements.\nOur conclusion then, on the second ground of the respondent\u2019s argument, is that the Dairy Company is not precluded by the Public Utilities Act from raising estoppel.\nWe shall now turn to the first ground and inquire whether or not on general principles estoppel is applicable to this case.\nThe learned trial judge thought the case governed by the third proposition laid down by Brett J. in Carr v. London & North Western Ry. Co.[23] where, discussing the principles of estoppel, he states:\nAnd another proposition is, that, if a man, whatever his real meaning may be, so conducts himself that a reasonable man would take his conduct to mean a certain representation of facts, and that it was a true representation, and that the latter was intended to act upon it in a particular way, and he with such belief does act in that way to his damage, the first is estopped from denying that the facts were as represented.\nThe trial judge in the case at bar applied that proposition in a rigid literal sense, holding that, although the plaintiff made the representations, no reasonable man would understand from them that the Electric Company intended the Dairy Company to act in the particular way in which it did act, that is, in using them as a basis for fixing cream prices. In my opinion, this construction is too narrow and rigid. It was enough, I think, that the Electric Company must be taken to have intended and expected the Dairy Company to act upon the representations in the ordinary course of its business, such as to devote the uncollected electric money to profits or dividends, or to building up reserves, or improving its plant; or to devote the money to increasing its business by advertising or by lowering the selling price of its products. If the money might be used for these things, or any of them, why may it not be used to increase the price of raw materials, and so, perhaps, in a competitive field, increase the volume of business, with beneficial results that might follow therefrom. Such a use of the moneys does not appear to me to be so unusual as to cause surprise in the minds of business men familiar with the management of such businesses. This broader construction is not inconsistent with the language employed by Brett J. in his third proposition, rather it is a fair interpretation of that language. And it is in harmony with the language used by Baron Parke in Freeman v. Cooke[24], where he says that,\nif, whatever a man\u2019s real intention may be, he so conducts himself that a reasonable man would take the representation to be true, and believe that it was meant that he should act upon it, and did act upon it as true, the party making the representation would be equally precluded from contesting its truth;\nand with Lord Tomlin\u2019s language in Greenwood v. Martins Bank[25] where, delivering the unanimous opinion of the House of Lords, he said, speaking generally in respect to estoppel, at p. 57:\nThe essential factors giving rise to an estoppel are, I think:\u2014\n(1) A representation or conduct amounting to a representation intended to induce a course of conduct on the part of the person to whom the representation is made.\n(2) An act or omission resulting from the representation, whether actual or by conduct, by the person to whom the representation is made.\n(3) Detriment to such person as a consequence of the act or omission.\nThe clause \u201cintended to induce a course of conduct,\u201d used by Lord Tomlin, is broader, as well as more authoritative, than the statement of Brett J., \u201cintended to act upon it in a particular way,\u201d and is wide enough to include, I think, the course of conduct followed by the Dairy Company in reliance upon the representations made in this case.\nMoreover, the Dairy Company did act upon these representations by paying the electric bills, and if for any reason the moneys it saved through the misrepresentations were distributed among the farmers or customers of the company as gratuities or bonuses so that the Dairy Company could not recover them, it seems to me that the case would be covered by estoppel as in such cases as Skyring v. Greenwood (1), Horton v. Westminster Improvement Commissioners (2).\nFor these reasons, I think that estoppel is applicable in this case and that the appeal should be allowed and judgment entered dismissing the action with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: P.

It was assessed in respect of such income by the respondent city, and the questions for determination were, whether appellant was entitled to exemption under s. 4 (22) of the Assessment Act (R.S.O. 1927, c. 238, as amended in 1930, c. 46), and, if so, to what extent. Held: For the purposes of such assessment, appellant was not a \u201cperson\u201d within the phrase \u201call other persons\u201d in said s. 4 (22) and was not entitled to exemption thereunder. (The words \u201cincome derived\u201d and \u201cincome received,\u201d as used in the Act, and the distinction indicated, from the Act and from the history of the legislation, in the use of those phrases, discussed, and the distinction, as made in McLeod v. City of Windsor, [1923] Can. S.C.R. 696, applied).\nAPPEAL by the Toronto General Trusts Corporation (hereinafter called the \u201cTrusts Corporation\u201d) from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] allowing the appeal of the City of Ottawa (the present respondent) from the judgment of Daly Co. C.J.\nThe Trusts Corporation is the executor or trustee of the estates in question, and, as executor or trustee, in each estate, during the year 1932, received income on behalf of and payable to more than one person resident outside of Ontario. It filed income returns in 1933 with the Assessment Commissioner of the City of Ottawa in respect of the incomes received on behalf of all such estates and such non-resident beneficiaries. The Corporation of the City of Ottawa is the municipality which, under s. 13 (1) (5) of the Assessment Act (R.S.O. 1927, c. 238, as amended in 1930, by 20 Geo. V, c. 46) was entitled to assess the Trusts Corporation for income received by it as executor or trustee on behalf of the several beneficiaries in such estates as were resident outside of Ontario.\nIn determining the amount of income to be assessed against the Trusts Corporation, as executor or trustee, the Assessment Commissioner allowed an exemption of $1,500 upon each return in respect of so much of such income as was payable by the trustee to persons resident outside of Ontario, irrespective of the number of such beneficiaries.\nFrom such assessments the Trusts Corporation appealed to the Court of Revision of the City of Ottawa, which reduced such assessments by directing that an exemption of $1,500 be allowed in respect of the income payable to each beneficiary resident outside of Ontario.\nThe City of Ottawa appealed to His Honour, Judge Daly, Judge of the County Court of the County of Carleton. As the same question arose in respect of the assessment in each estate, the appeals were consolidated and heard together. The learned County Court Judge dismissed the appeal. At the request of counsel for the City of Ottawa, he stated the questions of law involved in the appeal, in the form of a special case for a Divisional Court, pursuant to the provisions of s. 84 of the said Assessment Act. The questions stated were as follows:\u2014\nQuestion 1. Was I correct in holding that the Toronto General Trusts Corporation are a \u201cperson\u201d within the meaning of such word as used in the phrase \u201cand to the amount of $1,500 in the case of all other persons,\u201d as they appear in subsection 22, of section 4, of the Assessment Act, namely:\u2014\n\u201c22. The annual income derived from any source by any person assessable directly in respect to income under this Act, to the amount of $3,000 if such person is a householder in the municipality and assessed as such, or being the head of a family occupies with his family any portion of a dwelling house although not assessed therefor, or if the person is a widow or over sixty years of age, and to the amount of $1,500 in the case of all other persons.\u201d\nQuestion 2. If the above question is answered in the affirmative, was I correct in holding, that the Toronto General Trusts Corporation, being executors, administrators, trustees or agents (as the case may be) of an estate or fund created or left by a person resident in Ontario, and having received in the year 1932, as such executors, administrators, trustees or agents, income from such fund or estate on behalf of and payable to persons resident outside of Ontario, and being assessed in respect thereof by the Appellant Corporation, were entitled under the provisions of subsection 22, of section 4, of the Assessment Act, to an exemption of $1,500, in respect of the income received by them on behalf of and payable to each such non-resident beneficiary; that is to say, where there are two or more non-resident beneficiaries in the same estate, should the income received on behalf of each such non-resident beneficiary be exempt from assessment to the extent of $1,500?\nOn appeal by the City of Ottawa, on the special case stated as aforesaid, the Court of Appeal allowed the City\u2019s appeal; and to question one, answered \u201cNo\u201d; and, in consequence of such answer, found it unnecessary to answer question two.\nSpecial leave was granted to the Trusts Corporation by the Supreme Court of, Canada[2] to appeal to this Court. By the judgment now reported, the appeal to this Court was dismissed with costs.\nW.F. Schroeder for the appellant.\nF.B. Proctor K.C. for the respondent. The judgment of Duff C.J. and Lamont and Crocket JJ. was delivered by\nLAMONT J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in a special case stated by His Honour Judge Daly, Senior Judge of the County Court of the County of Carleton. The first question set out in the special case is:\u2014\nWas I correct in holding that the Toronto General Trusts Corporation are a \u201cperson\u201d within the meaning of such word as used in the phrase \u201cand to the amount of $1,500 in the case of all other persons,\u201d as they appear in subsection 22 of section 4 of the Assessment Act, namely:\u2014\n\u201c22. The annual income derived from any source by any person assessable directly in respect to income under this Act, to the amount of $3,000 if such person is a householder in the municipality and assessed as such, or being the head of a family occupies with his family any portion of a dwelling house although not assessed therefor, or if the person is a widow or over sixty years of age, and to the amount of $1,500 in the case of all other persons.\u201d\nThe facts of the case are as follows: The Toronto General Trusts Corporation (hereinafter called the Trusts Corporation) are the executors or administrators or trustees of the estates hereinafter mentioned, that is to say, the estate of the late J.L. Murphy, the estate of the late A.F. Rogers, the estate of the late Rev. W.T. Herridge, the estate of the late A.D. Broderick and the estate of the late W.C. MacKay.\nDuring the year 1932 the said Trusts Corporation received certain sums of money as executors or administrators or trustees of the above mentioned estates on behalf of and payable to certain beneficiaries resident outside of Ontario. Income returns were filed in 1933 by the Trusts Corporation with the Assessment Commissioner of the City of Ottawa in respect of income payable to the several beneficiaries.\nThe part of the income which the return shewed was received in Ontario and was payable to each of the beneficiaries (resident outside of Ontario) was assessed by the Assessment Commissioner to the Trusts Corporation for 1933. No assessment was made against or in the name of any non-resident beneficially entitled to any part of the income.\nThe learned County Court Judge decided in favour of the appellant and upheld the view of the Court of Revision that the exemption of $1,500 mentioned in subsection 22 of section 4 of the Assessment Act should be allowed to the Trusts Corporation in respect of each return of income made on behalf of a person residing outside of Ontario and paid to such person. The City of Ottawa appealed from this decision to the Court of Appeal for Ontario. That Court reversed the judgment and held that the answer to the first question should be \u201cNo.\u201d\nThe material section of the statute to be construed in the present case is section 4, subsection 22.\nTwo of the principal contentions on behalf of the respondent were:\u2014\n(1) That \u201cpersons\u201d in the phrase \u201call other persons\u201d of subsection 22 of section 4 of the Assessment Act, as amended by the Statutes of Ontario of 1930, ch. 46, s. 1, means and includes only \u201cnatural persons\u201d;\n(2) That \u201cpersons\u201d in that phrase includes only persons who are assessable in respect of income to which they are beneficially entitled.\nIt is unnecessary to pass on the first of these.\nAs to the second, Mr. Proctor very properly calls our attention to the circumstance that, in section 4, in which the general rule relating to the assessment of income is declared, there is a difference between the phraseology designating the liability of residents of Ontario in respect of the taxation of income coming to them for their own behoof, and that in relation to income received in Ontario \u201cby or on behalf of\u201d a person resident outside of the province. In the second case, where the recipient may or may not be beneficially entitled to the income to be assessed, that income is designated as \u201cincome received,\u201d while in the first case the income assessable falls under the phrase \u201cincome derived.\u201d This distinction of phraseology would appear to have been observed generally in the enactments relating to the assessment of income from 1897 down to the present time. For example, in section 12 (1) of the Revised Statutes of Ontario, 1927, ch. 238, the phrase employed is \u201cincome received\u201d where the subject matter dealt with is income which is received in Ontario for or on behalf of persons resident out of Ontario and income received in Ontario for or on behalf of an estate or trust. On the other hand, in subsections 16 and 18 of section 4 of the same statute, the phrase \u201cderived by any person from His Majesty\u2019s Imperial Treasury\u201d is used to qualify officers\u2019 pay and pensions, salaries, etc.; and \u201cincome derived\u201d is used in relation to the income which comes to a farmer from his farm. In both these cases, the income is envisaged, of course, as income to which the recipient is beneficially entitled.\nThe successive Assessment Acts beginning with that of 1897 and coming down to and including the Assessment Act in the Revised Statutes of 1927 (those of 1904, 1914 and 1927) contain in each case a provision dealing with the exemption of income, of which subsection 22 of section 4, as amended in 1930, is the successor. These various enactments, passed during this period of 30 years, all deal, obviously, with one subject matter: exemptions enjoyed in respect of income to which the recipient is beneficially entitled; and, in each case, the terms in which the enactment is expressed recognizes the distinction in phraseology adverted to. In each case, the income, to which the exemption attaches, is denoted by the phrase \u201cincome derived.\u201d In section 4 (22), as amended in 1930, this form of phraseology is preserved. Reading the amended section in light of the whole of the provisions relating to the assessment of income, including the series of enactments of 1897, 1904, 1914 and 1927, to which it is the successor, it would seem a reasonable view that the subject matter of the section, as amended, is the same as the subject matter of the section in its unamended form in R.S.O. 1927, and of each one of this succession of enactments beginning in 1897; namely, exemptions attaching to income to which the recipient is beneficially entitled. This view as to the distinction explained, in its application to the provisions of the Ontario Assessment Act (R.S.O. 1914, cap. 195), has been explicitly accepted in the judgments of this Court and of the Ontario Courts. McLeod v. City of Windsor[3].\nFurther, an exemption gives a privilege in respect of taxation, and the principle is not only well settled, but rests upon obvious reasons that those who advance a claim to special treatment in such matters must shew that the privilege invoked has unquestionably been created. (City of Montreal v. Coll\u00e8ge Sainte Marie[4]).\nOn the whole, therefore, it would appear that the exempting section ought not to be applied to income assessed under section 13 (1) of the Assessment Act, as amended in 1930. The decision of the Court of Appeal to the effect that, for the purposes of the application of the exempting section, the appellant corporation is not a person within the meaning of the phrase \u201call other persons,\u201d is, in my opinion, correct and should not be disturbed.\nThe appeal will, therefore, be dismissed with costs.\nCANNON J.\u2014Under section 4 of the Assessment Act,\n* * * all income [a] derived either within or out of Ontario by any person resident therein, or [b] received in Ontario by or on behalf of any person resident out of the same shall be liable to taxation,\nsubject to certain exemptions. Amongst others, subsection 22 exempts the annual income derived from any source by any person assessable directly in respect to income under this Act to the amount of $1,500 in the case of all persons other than (1) a householder in the municipality and assessed as such, or (2) being the head of a family occupies with his family any portion of a dwelling house although not assessed therefor, or (3) a widow, or (4) a person over sixty years of age. These four categories enjoy an exemption of $3,000.\nNow, under section 13, subsection 1, of the Act, as amended in 1930,\nWhere a person resident in Ontario creates a trust or agency fund or dies leaving an estate, and income from such fund or estate is payable to a person resident outside of Ontario, the income payable to such non-resident shall be assessed in the hands of the executors, administrators, trustees or agents of such estate or fund, who may pay the amount of taxes out of the income in their hands.\nThis section taxes the income payable to each non-resident in the hands of the executors or trustees. Can it be said that the exempting clause does apply to the income received in Ontario by or on behalf of any person resident out of the same? It seemed to me at first, that the exemption would apply both to the income derived in Ontario by residents and to income received in Ontario for non-residents, if assessable directly, under the Act, the latter being the only one assessable in the hands of the trustee, as is clearly shown by the late Chief Justice Anglin in McLeod v. City of Windsor[5]. But, in this latter case, this Court made a clear distinction between \u201cderived\u201d and \u201creceived\u201d as used in this Act, and decided that \u201cderived\u201d meant \u201creceived by a person beneficially entitled.\u201d The trustee, although directly assessed in his representative capacity, does not \u201cderive\u201d any income for his own benefit, and therefore would seem to be outside the scope of the exemption clause. It may be a casus omissus, as this interpretation discriminates against non-residents and may have the effect, which the Legislature probably never contemplated, of causing a flight of such trust funds and capital away from this province.\nThe Assessment Commissioner of the respondent allowed an exemption of $1,500 upon each return in respect of so much income as was payable by the trustees to persons resident outside of Ontario, irrespective of the number of such beneficiaries. Such was the position, which was satisfactory to the respondent, before an appeal was launched by the appellants.\nThe Court of Revision decided that in the case of each estate the executors or trustees were entitled to an exemption of $1,500 from the amount of income in their hands for the benefit of each beneficiary who resided outside of Ontario.\nThe County Judge agreed with the Court of Revision but, in his stated case, put the questions in such a way that, when the matter came before the Court of Appeal, the respondent was enabled to secure a judgment which went much further than the position taken by the Assessment Commissioner and decided, in effect, that the exemption clause did not apply to non-residents.\nIt seems to me that the only issue raised by the parties at the origin of this litigation was limited to this\u2014whether or not the Assessment Commissioner was right in limiting the exemption to $1,500 for each estate, instead of allowing the same exemption to each non\u2011resident beneficiary. However, the sole question before us is whether or not we should give a different answer than the one adopted by the Court of Appeal. I consider myself bound by the interpretation adopted by this Court in the Windsor case[6] in 1923 and I would, therefore, answer in the negative the first question stated by the learned County Judge.\nThis appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDYSART J. (ad hoc)\u2014I concur in the dismissal of this appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: MacCraken, Fleming & Schroeder.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Frank B.

The trade-mark was registered with the Secretary of State for New York on February 10, 1927; in the United States Patent Office on July 12, 1932; and in the Canadian Patent Office on June 2, 1933, the application being filed on September 30, 1932, under the provisions of the Trade Mark and Design Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 201. Defendant was incorporated in March, 1932, for the purpose of acquiring and continuing two preexisting businesses for the sale of toilet articles, and on April 8, 1932, it filed an application to register \u201cPeggy Royal\u201d as a trade-mark, and was granted a certificate as of June 11, 1932 (prior to which date those words had not been used for sale of its goods). Defendant\u2019s products were of the same nature as, but were of lower grade and lower priced than, those of plaintiffs. The containers used by defendant were different from those used by plaintiffs. Plaintiffs sued to expunge the latter trade-mark, from the register, on the grounds that its use would mislead the public and was an infringement of plaintiffs\u2019 trade-mark.\nHeld: (1) The onus was on plaintiffs to satisfy the court that the danger of deception exists, and that consequently the public should be protected by expunging the trade-mark complained of. The court, in the absence of direct evidence one way or the other, may draw such inferences from the facts proven as those facts prima facie warrant. The onus may be shifted. (Dewar v. John Dewar & Sons Ltd. 17 R.P.C. 341, at 356; Benj. Edgington Ltd. v. J. Edgington & Co., 6 R.P.C.513).\n(2) The words \u201cPeggy Royal,\u201d as printed on defendant\u2019s labels, so nearly resembled the device registered by plaintiff, and sounded so much like it, as to be calculated to deceive, and might induce some of the public to think that defendant\u2019s products were manufactured by plaintiff. Even if defendant did not intend to deceive and actual deception had not been proven, defendant\u2019s trade-mark should be expunged if, in the court\u2019s opinion, by its resemblance to that of plaintiff, it was likely to deceive the public in the course of its legitimate use in the trade. On these grounds defendant\u2019s trade-mark should be expunged (Eno v. Dunn, 15 App. Cas. 252, and other cases, cited). (Judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada, [1935] Ex.C.R. 70, reversed).\nAPPEAL by the plaintiffs from the judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], dismissing their action for an order that defendant\u2019s trademark be expunged from the Register of Trade Marks. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was allowed with costs throughout.\nW. L. Scott K.C. for the appellants.\nO. M. Biggar K.C. and R. S. Smart K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nCannon, J.\u2014The plaintiffs are appealing from a judgment of the Exchequer Court, of the 21st November, 19341, dismissing with costs an action to expunge from the register of trade-marks the entry by the respondents of the words \u201cPeggy Royal,\u201d on the ground that it is calculated to deceive and that it is an infringement of the appellants\u2019 registered mark \u201cPeggy Sage.\u201d The latter is the name adopted by Mrs. Rosabelle Sage, who established in the city of New York, in 1917, the business of manufacturing and selling toilet articles and toilet preparations.\nIt is not disputed that the goods have been sold continuously throughout the United States since that year and throughout Canada since 1920. These goods have from the beginning been sold under the trade-mark of \u201cPeggy Sage,\u201d which has been extensively advertised both in Canada and in the United States.\nThe plaintiff Peggy Sage Inc. was incorporated on January 18, 1930, for the purpose of acquiring and carrying on the business of Mrs. Sage under the latter\u2019s trade-mark or name. The plaintiff Northam-Warren Limited is the agent of Peggy Sage Inc. in Canada.\nOn February 10, 1927, Mrs. Sage registered the trademark \u201cPeggy Sage\u201d with the Secretary of State for New York. Peggy Sage Inc. registered it in the United States Patent Office on July 12, 1932, and in the Canadian Patent Office on June 2, 1933. The application was filed on September 30, 1932, under the provisions of the former Trade Mark and Design Act.\nThe respondent company was incorporated on March 22, 1932, for the purpose of acquiring and continuing two pre-existing businesses for the sale of toilet articles: A. L. Siegel & Co. Inc. which had the trade-mark of \u201cHostess,\u201d and E. Kahn Inc. using the trade-mark \u201cEkay,\u201d both Canadian branches of United States businesses with headquarters in New York city.\nOn discovery, the secretary of the respondent company gave an account of how the words \u201cPeggy Royal\u201d were selected at a conference at which Mr. Siegel, Mr. Kahn and the two Chantiers met in the Royal York Hotel in Toronto. Chantier says that he chose the word \u201cPeggy\u201d because it was the name of a friend of his, and that either Mr. Kahn or Mr. Siegel suggested the word \u201cRoyal\u201d because of the fact that the conference was held in the Royal York Hotel. No explanation was given why the marks previously in use in connection with the business of the two companies were discarded. Immediately after this meeting an application was filed on the 8th of April, 1932, to register \u201cPeggy Royal\u201d as a trade-mark and a certificate issued on June 11 of that year.\nThe registrar first objected to the use of the name \u201cRoyal\u201d because the word was already registered by other concerns in connection with toilet brushes and soap. The respondent having agreed to except from its application these two articles, the trade-mark was granted to the respondent as of June 11, 1932.\nThe gist of appellants\u2019 grievance is found in the following paragraphs of their statement of claim:\u2014\n12. The defendant\u2019s reason for selecting the words \u201cPeggy Royal\u201d as a trade-mark for toilet articles in connection with a newly established business, was evidently because of its similarity to the plaintiff Peggy Sage Inc.\u2019s trade-mark \u201cPeggy Sage\u201d and of the desire of the defendant to take advantage of the reputation that the goods of the plaintiff Peggy Sage Inc. have for so long enjoyed and of the extensive advertising by the plaintiff Peggy Sage Inc. and its predecessor in title.\n13. The defendant\u2019s use of the trade-mark \u201cPeggy Royal\u201d constitutes an infringement on the plaintiff Peggy Sage Inc.\u2019s trade-mark \u201cPeggy Sage.\u201d\n14. If the defendant is permitted to continue to use, for toilet articles, a trade-mark so similar to and so suggestive of, the plaintiff Peggy Sage Inc.\u2019s trade-mark, it will result in the public\u2019s being misled and confusing the defendant\u2019s goods with those of the plaintiff, to the great detriment of the plaintiff Peggy Sage Inc.\nThere is no question that the goods dealt in by the parties are the same, except that the appellants\u2019 are of a much higher grade and are sold in Canada at a higher price. The packages are also of different quality. But we must not lose sight of the fact that if its trade-mark is upheld, there is nothing to prevent the respondent from engaging in the manufacture and sale of a higher grade of goods.\nThe registrations of both these trade-marks in Canada were made under the old Trade Mark and Design Act. R.S.C. 1927, c. 201. The Unfair Competition Act, 1932, 22-23 George V, c 38, did not come into force until September 1, 1932; subsection 1 of section 61 thereof says that any application for the registration of a trade-mark received by the registrar at any time before the expiration of a month from the 1st of September, 1932, should be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of the Trade Mark and Design Act. The grounds of appeal are the following:\u2014\n1. The learned trial judge erred in holding that the onus was on the appellants to show that the mark was calculated to deceive or mislead the public. He should have held that the onus was on the respondent and had not been discharged.\n2. The learned trial judge should have held that, quite apart from any question of onus, the respondent\u2019s trademark \u201cPeggy Royal\u201d was void because of its similarity with the trade-mark \u201cPeggy Sage\u201d for the same class of goods and was calculated to deceive or mislead the public.\n3. The trial judge should have expunged the registration of \u201cPeggy Royal\u201d as void because of the fact that prior to its registration it had not acquired through user a secondary meaning as designating the goods of the respondent and that as a consequence it was not adapted to distinguish the goods of the respondent from the goods of other possible manufacturers of the same name, and that it did not, therefore, contain the essentials necessary to constitute a trade-mark properly speaking.\nI.\nTo support his first proposition, the appellant quoted Eno v. Dunn[2], where, under the English Act of 1883, the House of Lords held that, in the exercise of the discretion conferred by the Act whether to register a trademark or not, the Comptroller ought to refuse registration where it is not clear that deception may not result.\nSection 11 of our old Act covering this case provided for the refusal by the Minister of any trade-mark \u201cif it appears that the trade-mark is calculated to deceive or mislead the public.\u201d\nIn Eno v. Dunn2, Lord Herschell says, at p. 261, that the discretion to register or not \u201cmust be reasonably exercised\u201d; but, in his opinion, it was a reasonable exercise of it to refuse registration when it was not clear that deception might not result from it.\nAnd Lord Macnaghten (p. 262) remarks:\nUnfortunately, in the competition for business, a trader not unfrequently endeavours to attract custom by representing that the goods which he offers for sale are different in origin, composition, or character from what they really are. The public are constantly tempted to buy one thing when they think they are buying another. It is not, as has been observed by Lord Cairns, the province of the Court \u201cto protect speculations of this kind.\u201d\nBetween rival traders, the application of the principle is necessarily a matter of extreme difficulty. But, as between the innocent public and a trader seeking registration of a proposed trade-mark, there is, I think, no room for hesitation or doubt.\nOur attention was also drawn to McDowell v. Standard Oil Co.[3], and to the words used in his speech by Viscount Cave L.C., at p. 637:\nMy Lords, it has been long ago decided, and is quite clear, that the words \u201ccalculated to deceive\u201d which are found in s. 11 of the Trade Marks Act, 1905, do not mean \u201cintended to deceive\u201d but \u201clikely (or reasonably likely) to deceive or mislead the trade or the public.\u201d It has also been held in the case of Eno v. Dunn[4], decided in your Lordships\u2019 House, that the burden of proving that a proposed trade-mark is not likely to deceive lies upon the applicant, and also\u2014a proposition which, I think, follows upon the last\u2014that if that proof is incomplete and the matter is, as Lord Watson said in that case, in dubio, the application may be refused.\nThe appellants contend in their memorandum that, whereas in an action for an infringement the onus is on the plaintiff to prove the infringement, in the case of an application to register a trade-mark, the onus is on the applicant to satisfy the court that confusion might not arise from the registration of his mark. In other words, if there is any doubt at all, it must be resolved against the applicant.\nThe Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, in E-Z Waist Co. v. Reliance Manufacturing Co.[5], held that if there is doubt whether the registration of a trademark would cause confusion with a prior trade-mark, the doubt must be resolved against the newcomer, who had the entire field in which to select a trade-mark, so that there is no excuse for his closely approaching the mark of a business rival.\nThe learned President of the Exchequer Court says[6]:\u2014\nThe assistance to be derived from the evidence, in reaching a conclusion in this matter, is slight. In the conclusion which I am about to express it would be but pure affectation to say that I am absolutely free from doubt as to its correctness. My conclusion is that the plaintiffs have not made out a case to expunge the defendant\u2019s mark and must fail. I cannot upon the facts before me hold the marks in question here are so similar as to be likely to cause confusion.\nThe respondent submits on this first point that in England the rule is that the burden of proof is always on the party applying to have any change made in the register, on account of s. 40 of the English Act of 1905, which makes registration prima facie evidence, in applications under s. 35, of the validity of the original registration.\nKerly, on Trade Marks, 6th ed., p. 335, says:\u2014\nThe fact that the Registrar has exercised his discretion in favour of the registration of a mark, and has allowed it to be registered, does not prevent the Court from ordering its removal if the registration was made without sufficient cause; but an applicant for rectification is in a somewhat less advantageous position than an opponent to registration.\nAnd, at p. 336:\u2014\nBut where the objection alleged to a mark is that it is the same as that of the applicant, or that it has such resemblance to his as to be calculated to deceive, it will be some evidence against the applicant, on whom the burden lies of showing that the registration was made without sufficient cause, if he has stood by and allowed the registered proprietor to use the mark objected to for a length of time, especially if no case of actual deception is proved.\nThe plaintiffs in this case allege as a fact the danger of deception; and I believe that the onus of satisfying the court that such danger exists and that consequently the public should be protected by expunging the register, is on them. The court, in the absence of direct evidence, one way or the other, may draw such inferences from the facts proven as these facts prima facie warrant. \u201cIt is obvious that in such matters the onus may be shifted.\u201d Dewar v. John Dewar & Sons Ltd.[7]. See also Benjamin Edgington Ltd. v. John Edgington & Co.[8].\nII.\nAlthough no proof was made of actual deception, the evidence shows that the appellants\u2019 goods are sometimes asked for as \u201cPeggy\u201d goods, especially in telephone orders.\nThere was also evidence given by witnesses familiar with the trade to the effect that the dominant feature of the appellants\u2019 mark was \u201cPeggy.\u201d\nRobert Fairweather says:\u2014\nI would say that, without question, \u201cPeggy\u201d is the big word as far as the trade is concerned.\n* * * It was the selling feature.\n* * *\nIt was easily remembered and attractive.\nMrs. Alma G. Denys,\nThey are generally asked for by the name of Peggy Sage, but at different intervals during my four years at Simpson\u2019s I answered the telephone at the appointment desk and there different people asked me for \u201cPeggy\u201d Manicure. They order the goods by telephone. This not only happens in connection with the Peggy Sage goods but as we handle the Francis Fox Scalp Treatment they will call up and refer only to \u201cFrancis.\u201d\n* * *\nQ. Now what, in your opinion, is the dominant feature of the trademark \u201cPeggy Sage\u201d? What is the principal word in Peggy Sage?\u2014A. Naturally it would be \u201cPeggy.\u201d\nMrs. Olive M. Kennedy, another witness in the trade, says that the dominant feature of the trade-mark \u201cPeggy Sage\u201d is, of course, \u201cPeggy,\u201d \u201cbecause it is a catchy name.\u201d\nWilliam Arbuckle says that the dominant feature of the trade-mark is \u201cPeggy\u201d and that the people usually ask for \u201cPeggy Sage\u201d and at odd times \u201cPeggy.\u201d\nThe appellants have clearly established their right to the use of the trade-mark or name of \u201cPeggy Sage\u201d under which they have advertised and sold their goods in Canada since 1920. There is no doubt that they have sold so much goods under that mark that it had come throughout Canada to be associated with their goods.\nMoreover, it appears by the admission of the respondent\u2019s witness E. W. Chantier that the words \u201cPeggy Royal\u201d were not used for the sale of their goods before the registration, i.e., some time in the summer of 1932; so that they cannot claim in favour of the registration of their mark that it had been used as their property before registration in Canada, while \u201cPeggy Sage\u201d was used first and registered later and can claim protection against anybody trying to use a trade name or mark so nearly resembling it as to cause confusion.\nBut, says the respondent, assuming that the appellants would have an exclusive right to \u201cPeggy Sage,\u201d they cannot claim to stop any registration of any combination of words including \u201cPeggy.\u201d\nOn this point, In re the Trade Mark of La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme des Verreries de l\u2019Etoile[9] may be useful. The plaintiffs in that case, in 1876, registered as their trademark for glass a star, and, in 1893, they complained of a trade-mark which did not consist of a star but consisted of the words \u201cRed Star Brand.\u201d They asked the court to expunge the entry in the register.\nIn that case, it was contended, as in this one, that if the evidence adduced as to the existence of the appellant\u2019s trade-mark or name had been brought before the registrar prior to registration of the respondent\u2019s trade-mark, the latter\u2019s application to the registrar would have been refused, and that nothing had occurred to prevent the court from expunging the mark.\nMr. Justice Stirling said[10] that although physically the trade-mark registered by the respondents has no resemblance to the trade-mark of the applicants, if, however, it is brought to the notice of the registrar, by the evidence adduced by an opponent that, even though the two marks are not similar,\nthere is a reasonable probability of the public being misled into buying one thing when they think they are buying another, it would be his duty to refuse registration.\nIf the evidence brought before the court had been before the registrar when the trade-mark was sought to be registered, I think that registration ought to have been refused.\nThis, however, is not an opposition to the registration of a mark, but an action to expunge, and I think that the burden of authorities is to the effect that the plaintiffs must show definitely that their trade-mark will reasonably or likely be interfered with. In this case as in the other, the applicants heard of the \u201cPeggy Royal\u201d trade-mark registration shortly before the action was taken and took proceedings with sufficient rapidity. The evidence satisfies me that it has been used by them in Canada since 1920; and I am strongly inclined to think that the respondents were aware of the appellants\u2019 mark when they registered their own.\nTo my mind, the words \u201cPeggy Royal,\u201d as printed on the respondent\u2019s labels, so nearly resemble the device registered by Peggy Sage Inc. and sounds so much like it, as to be calculated to deceive and might induce some of the public to think that the lower priced products of the respondent were manufactured by the appellants.\nI am helped to reach this conclusion by Eno v. Dunn[11], in which the respondent applied to register the words \u201cDunn\u2019s Fruit Salt Baking Powder\u201d as a trade-mark for baking powder. The appellant, who had for many years used the words \u201cFruit Salt\u201d as his trade-mark for a powder used in producing an effervescent drink, opposed the application.\nThe House of Lords held that upon the evidence the proposed words were as a matter of fact calculated to deceive the people and that the trade-mark ought not to be registered.\nI feel, as Lord Watson felt in that case, p. 258, that I cannot avoid the conclusion that the respondent adopted the word \u201cPeggy,\u201d as it now stands in its trade-mark, with the purpose of obtaining pecuniary advantage from the reputation of the appellants\u2019 manufacture. In that case, it was argued that to give effect to these considerations would be equivalent to allowing the appellant to appropriate as his own property two words in common use. Lord Watson answers that the argument appears to him to underrate the resources of the English language, which are quite sufficient to enable anyone honestly desirous of distinguishing his own goods to use these words in a trade-mark in such a manner as to prevent any possibility of their being connected with the competitor\u2019s goods.\nLord Herschell, in that same case, said that it was not necessary to reach the conclusion that the proposed use of the words would be calculated to deceive. He thought it would be enough to say that he was not satisfied that there would be no possible danger of the public being deceived.\nLord Macnaghten remarked, at pages 263-264:\u2014\nThe learned judges who were in favour of Mr. Dunn in the Court below seem to have come to the conclusion that Mr. Dunn\u2019s object was to obtain the benefit of the celebrity which the name adopted by Mr. Eno has acquired, but that it was not his object to steal Mr. Eno\u2019s trade. So far I am disposed to agree; but I do not think that those propositions cover the real question. The question is one between Mr. Dunn and the public, not between Mr. Eno and Mr. Dunn. It is immaterial whether the proposed registration is or is not likely to injure Mr. Eno in his trade. As pointed out by Lindley L.J., in In re the Trade Mark of La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme des Verreries de l\u2019Etoile[12]:\u2014\nTwo marks may be calculated to deceive either by appealing to the eye or to the ear, or one appealing to the eye and one to the ear.\nMM. Siegel and Kahn, for obvious reasons, were not heard by the respondent to explain why they abandoned their respective trade-marks \u201cHostess\u201d and \u201cEkay,\u201d used by them in Canada, to substitute for them the words \u201cPeggy Royal\u201d (which was not the name of any person connected with the manufacture or sale of their toilet products), under the guise of a signature resembling the signature of \u201cPeggy Sage\u201d then registered in New York and used in Canada and the United States for years and extensively advertised. Then, why did they not themselves advertise \u201cPeggy Royal\u201d? They might have, by doing so, prevented the public from confusing the origin of their own goods. They thought wise to use the word \u201cPeggy,\u201d which was well known in the trade, without publishing that \u201cPeggy Royal\u201d was of their own manufacture.\nIt is true that the packing and containers are not the same. But, assuming that they did not try to confuse the eye, they, I believe, attempted to deceive by appealing to the ear of the purchasing public\u2014and in both cases we find on the labels, printed in a peculiar but somewhat similar script, the signatures, which may, to a certain extent, deceive the eye.\nBut, even if the respondent did not intend to deceive, and if actual deception has not been proven, the registration should be expunged, if, in the opinion of the court, it is calculated to deceive, which does not mean \u201ccapable of being used to deceive\u201d but that, by its resemblance to the appellants\u2019, it is likely to deceive the public in the course of its legitimate use in the trade.\nKerly, on Trade Marks, p. 266.\nThe appellants, therefore, ought to succeed on the second point.\nIt would be useless to discuss the third point as to whether or not the trade-mark \u201cPeggy Royal\u201d contains the necessary constituting essentials. I would, therefore, allow the appeal with costs and order that the respondent\u2019s trade-mark \u201cPeggy Royal\u201d be expunged from the Register of Trade Marks, volume 253, folio 54511, with all costs below against the respondent.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Ewart, Scott, Kelley, Scott & Howard.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Osier, Hoskin & Harcourt.\n[1] [1935] Ex.C.R. 70.\n1 [1935] Ex.C.R. 70.\n[2] (1890) 15 App. Cas. 252.\n2 (1890) 15 App. Cas. 252.\n[3] [1927] A.C. 632.\n[4] 15 App. Gas. 252.\n[5] (1923) 286 Federal Reporter, 461.\n[6] [1935] Ex.C.R., at 75-76.\n[7] (1900) 17 R.P.C. 341, at 356.\n[8] (1889) 6 R.P.C. 513.\n[9] (1803) 10 R.P.C. 436, and (in appeal) (1894) 11 R.P.C. 142.\n[10] 10 R.P.C., at 439.\n[11] (1890) 15 App. Cas. 252.\n[12] (1894) 11 R.P.C. 142, at 146.\n",

Under directions in his will his executor, on an event which happened in 1912, divided the residue of his estate into two equal parts, one-half going (subject to charge) to the testator\u2019s two sons. As to the \u201cother half\u201d (the part now in question) the will directed that it be charged with certain annuities, etc., and that (subject to charges) upon the testator\u2019s wife\u2019s death (subject to delay in the event of her death before a certain time, which did not happen) it should be distributed in equal shares amongst nine named beneficiaries, with proviso that should any of them predecease her or die before the period of distribution (which will now, under the circumstances, be the testator\u2019s wife\u2019s death) the deceased beneficiary\u2019s child or children living at the date of such distribution should take the share which the parent would have received if then living; but if the deceased beneficiary left no child or children living at the date of distribution, the share should belong to the testator\u2019s two sons in equal shares. The testator\u2019s widow is still living. This Court has held ([1934] Can. S.C.R. 403) that, on construction of the will, the testator\u2019s two sons took, on the testator\u2019s death, a vested interest in equal shares in said \u201cother half\u201d (subject to charges), subject to partial defeasance in favour of any of said nine beneficiaries (or, alternatively, their issue) who might be living at the time fixed for distribution. The present question was concerned with the disposal of the surplus income accumulated from the said \u201cother half\u201d of the residue of the estate.\nHeld: The accumulation of surplus income and of income thereon during the 21 years following the testator\u2019s death (the period limited for accumulation in such a case by the Accumulations Act, R.S.O. 1927, c. 138) is divisible as it existed on January 26, 1930 (the end of said period of 21 years) in the same manner as the corpus, upon the death of the testator\u2019s widow; and the accumulation of surplus income and of income thereon after January 26, 1930, and until the testator\u2019s widow\u2019s death, is distributable as upon an intestacy. The clear implication from the will was that the testator meant to provide for the distribution, on his widow\u2019s death, of the fund as it should then stand, including all the accumulation of surplus income and of income thereon. This is also the implication which the law, failing any words indicating the testator\u2019s intention to exclude it, would itself annex to the gift, whether the gift be one which vests in the beneficiaries on the testator\u2019s death or an executory bequest vesting only on the testator\u2019s widow\u2019s death (Wharton v. Masterman, [1895] A.C. 186, at 198, 191-192; Bective v. Hodgson, 10 H. of L. Cas. 656, at 664-665). But as the accumulations have gone beyond the period allowed by the Accumulations Act, to that extent the direction for accumulation is void, so that that portion of the surplus income and the income thereon which has accumulated since January 26, 1930, is distributable as upon an intestacy (s. 1 of the Act).\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, [1935] 1 D.L.R. 263, [1935] Ont. W.N. 1, affirmed.\nAPPEAL by the Soldiers\u2019 Aid Commission of Ontario from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming (subject to a variation in form) the judgment of Hope J. on an originating motion launched by the National Trust Co. Ltd., executor and trustee of the estate of Herbert Carlyle Hammond, deceased, for the determination of certain questions as to the disposal of the accumulation of surplus income arising under paragraph 15 of the will of the said deceased.\nThe will, after some specific bequests, gave the residue of his estate to his executors in trust for purposes defined in the will. Then, after certain directions and gifts of annuities, the will provided, par. 14, that, \u201con the death of my said wife or when my youngest son shall or would have attained the age of twenty-five years whichever event shall first happen,\u201d the trustees should divide the net residue into two equal parts, and one part (subject to a charge) \u201cshall be equally divided between my said two sons\u201d (with provisions for gifts over in events which did not happen); then, par. 15, that the \u201cother half\u201d of the said residuary estate (subject to charges) \u201cupon the death of my said wife * * * shall subject as hereinafter be distributed in equal shares amongst\u201d nine named beneficiaries, with provisions that should any of them \u201cpredecease my said wife or die before the period of distribution with reference to this half of my residuary estate leaving a child or children surviving, such child or children living at the date of such distribution * * * shall take the share which the parent * * * would have received if living at the time of such distribution\u201d and that the share of any of said nine beneficiaries \u201cwho shall die before the period of distribution aforesaid without leaving any child or children who shall be living at the date of distribution shall belong to my said two sons in equal shares\u201d; and that, in the event (which did not happen) of the wife dying before the youngest son \u201cshall or would have attained the age of twenty-five years,\u201d then the period of distribution with regard to this half of the residuary estate should be delayed until the latter event.\nThe testator died in 1909, leaving his widow and two sons. The widow is still living. The younger son attained the age of 25 years in 1912, and conformably to (and subject to) par. 14 of the will, the trustee then divided the net residue of the estate into two equal parts and divided one part between the two sons. The older son died in 1915 and the younger son in 1930.\nCertain questions arising under said par. 15 of the will were dealt with in a judgment of this Court delivered on March 6, 1934[2], which held that, on construction of the will, the testator\u2019s two sons took, on the testator\u2019s death, a vested interest in equal shares in the \u201cother half\u201d (of the residuary estate) disposed of in par. 15 (subject to charges there mentioned), subject to partial defeasance in favour of any of the said nine beneficiaries (or, alternatively, their issue) who might be living at the time fixed for distribution; and therefore, one of the said nine beneficiaries named in par. 15 having died without issue in 1922, the sons\u2019 estates took the benefit of the aliquot part of the residuary estate which that deceased beneficiary would have received under par. 15 had she lived until the time therein fixed for distribution; but that that aliquot part was not payable until the testator\u2019s widow\u2019s death.\nBy The Soldiers\u2019 Aid Commission Amendment Act, 1922, 12-13 Geo. V, c. 40, it was enacted that the Soldiers\u2019 Aid Commission of Ontario, the present appellant, should be the beneficiary as to one-half of the residue of the estate of Kathleen Saunders Hammond, who was the widow of, and the sole beneficiary under the will of, Frederick S. Hammond, the older son of the said Herbert Carlyle Hammond, deceased.\nThe Soldiers\u2019 Aid Commission of Ontario, the present appellant, contended that the intermediate income of the \u201cother half\u201d (of the residuary estate) disposed of in par. 15 (subject to charges there mentioned) belongs to those in whom the fund is vested, up to and until the defeasance happens, and hence the accumulation of surplus income of this \u201cother half\u201d belongs to the estates of the testator\u2019s two deceased sons in equal shares. Alternatively it contended that the testator did not dispose by his will of the surplus income arising out of that part of the residue of his estate dealt with by said par. 15, and that he died intestate as to such surplus income; which would mean that the surplus income would be divided into three equal parts amongst the testator\u2019s widow and the estates of the two sons.\nThe Court of Appeal held that all the accumulation of surplus income and of income thereon in respect of the fund disposed of by par. 15 of the will during the period of 21 years following the testator\u2019s death, to wit, from January 26, 1909, until January 26, 1930, is divisible as it exists on January 26, 1930, in the same manner as the corpus of the said fund upon the arrival of the period of distribution, which, in the events that have happened, is upon the death of the testator\u2019s widow; and that all accumulations of surplus income and of income thereon in respect of the said fund, after January 26, 1930, and until the death of the testator\u2019s widow, is distributable as upon an intestacy.\nC.M.

(Official Guardian) for infant respondents. W.B. Milliken K.C. for respondent Fannie Hammond.\nW. Judson for respondent National Trust Co. Ltd., executor of H.C. Hammond estate.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nCROCKET, J.\u2014This appeal has to do entirely with the disposal of the surplus income which has accumulated from the second half of the residue of the estate of the above named testator since his death on January 26, 1909, and which it is stated now amounts to approximately $600,000.\nThe testator appointed The National Trust Co., Ltd., to be the executors and trustees of his will, and, after directing payment of his debts, funeral and testatmentary expenses, and making several specific devises and bequests, devised and bequeathed all the rest, residue and remainder of his estate to his executors and trustees in trust \u201cto realize such portions thereof from time to time as it may be necessary to realize.\u201d He then directed his trustees out of the income and profits of his estate to pay annuities of $2,000 and $12,000 to his mother and to his wife in quarterly instalments during their respective lives, and annuities of $1,000 each to his two sons until the younger of them should attain the age of 25 years, and life annuities in quarterly instalments also to fifteen named friends, as well as $7,000 per annum to the National Trust Co. with a direction to pay that sum quarterly or so much thereof as may be required for the payment of sums mentioned in a written memorandum addressed to them relating to the latter bequest. Authority was given to his executors that, if his estate should not realize sufficient profits or income to pay the charges and annuities set forth in the will, to supplement the same out of the principal so that during each quarter the full bequests specified should be received by each party entitled thereto. He authorized his trustees to advance to each of his sons out of the principal of his estate, if they thought it wise to do so after they respectively should attain majority and before the time of distribution, in addition to the annual payments of $1,000, a sum to the amount of $20,000 each. Then by paragraph 14 he directed, \u201con the death of my said wife or when my youngest son shall or would have attained the age of twenty-five years whichever event shall first happen,\u201d to \u201cdivide the net residue and remainder of my estate into two equal parts,\u201d and that one of these equal parts should be equally divided between his two sons subject to the payment of one-half of the $12,000 annuity to their mother during her life, and with a provision that should either die before the period of distribution and without having disposed of his share by his last will and leaving lawful issue such share should devolve on such issue, otherwise that it should go to the survivor. The other half of the residuary estate he directed, by paragraph 15, should be charged with the payment to his wife of one-half of the $12,000 annuity given to his wife, and with all the other annuities and annual charges previously mentioned, and that upon the death of his wife this other half of his residuary estate, subject to all the existing annuities or annual charges above mentioned and after making provision for the said annuities continuing thereafter, should \u201cbe distributed in equal shares\u201d amongst nine named beneficiaries, all of whom had already been named in paragraph 9 among the beneficiaries to whom annuities were there bequeathed, with a proviso that if any of them should predecease the testator\u2019s wife or die before the period of distribution with reference to that half of his residuary estate leaving a child or children surviving, such child or children living at the date of such distribution should take the deceased parent\u2019s share, but that the share of any of the nine named persons who should die before the period of distribution \u201cwithout leaving any child or children who shall be living at the date of distribution shall belong to my said two sons in equal shares.\u201d\nThe younger son attained the age of 25 in 1912, whereupon the residue of the estate was divided into two equal parts, one of which, subject to the charges mentioned, was divided between the sons. No question arises as to this moiety of the residue. Both sons predeceased their mother, the testator\u2019s widow. The elder son died in 1915 and the younger in 1930. The former appointed the National Trust Co., Ltd., his executor and trustee, and devised and bequeathed all his estate, both real and personal, to his wife. She died in 1919 and a year later a grant of letters of administration of her estate with the will annexed was made to the National Trust Co., Ltd., also. One half of the residue of her estate subsequently became vested in the Soldiers\u2019 Aid Commission of Ontario, the present appellant, under the terms of The Soldiers\u2019 Aid Commission Amendment Act, 1922, 12-13 Geo. V, (Ont.), cap. 40. Probate of the last will of the younger son was granted by the Supreme Court of British Columbia (in Probate) in 1930 to the respondent The Royal Trust Co.\nThe widow of the testator still survives, so that no distribution has yet been made of the second half of the residue of the testator\u2019s estate under paragraph 15 of his will.\nWhile the younger son was still living, one of the beneficiaries named in paragraph 15 of the will, Jessie Butler, died without issue, and after the younger son\u2019s death in 1930 the Supreme Court of Ontario was moved on an originating notice to determine whether the interest of the deceased younger son in Miss Butler\u2019s share of the second half of the testator\u2019s residuary estate was then payable to the deceased younger son\u2019s estate, and whether the other deceased son had a vested interest in the share of the said Jessie Butler which was then payable to his estate. These questions came before this Court in November, 1933, on a direct appeal by consent of all parties from the judgment of Kingstone, J., on the originating notice, wherein this Court unanimously held that both sons took upon the death of the testator a vested interest in equal shares in the second half of the residuary estate disposed of in paragraph 15, charged with one half of the annuity provided for the widow and with all other annuities and annual charges there mentioned, subject to partial defeasance in favour of any of the named beneficiaries (or, alternatively, their issue) at the time fixed for distribution, but that such interests were not then payable to their respective estates. See judgment of Rinfret, J., in In Re Hammond[3]. While the latter case was still pending, the National Trust Co. launched a further motion to determine the ownership of the surplus income which had accumu- lated on the fund dealt with by paragraph 15 of the will. The questions submitted to the court were as follows:\u2014\n1. Does the surplus income of the other half of the residuary estate of the testator mentioned in paragraph 15 of his will fall into and form part of such other half of such residuary estate, and if not, does it pass as on an intestacy?\n2. If such surplus income falls into and forms part of such other half of such residuary estate then, in view of the provisions of the Accumulations Act, R.S.O. c. 138, what limitation, if any, is there as to the period during which such surplus income falls into and forms part of such other half of such residuary estate and if there be any such limitation, does the surplus income accumulating thereafter pass as on an intestacy?\n3. If there be any surplus income which falls into and forms part of such other half of such residuary estate, then does the interest on such surplus income fall into and form part of such other half of such residuary estate, or does such interest pass as on an intestacy, and from what date does such interest accrue?\nHope, J., held upon these questions that the accumulation of income during the 21-year period following the testator\u2019s death\u2014the period limited for accumulation of rents and profits in such a case, by the Accumulations Act (cap. 138, R.S. Ont.)\u2014became part of the second half of the residue disposed of by paragraph 15 as construed by this Court, and that the accumulation of income after the expiration of the 21-year period should pass as on an intestacy.\nOn appeal by The Soldiers\u2019 Aid Commission, the Court of Appeal held that Mr. Justice Hope\u2019s judgment was right and affirmed the same subject to a variation in form. The formal judgment of the Appeal Court declared that all the accumulation of surplus income and of income thereon in respect of the fund disposed of by paragraph 15 of the said will during the period of twenty-one years following the death of the testator, viz., from January 26, 1909, until January 26, 1930, is divisible as it exists on the last mentioned date in the same manner as the corpus of the said fund upon the arrival of the period of distribution, which, in the events that have happened, is upon the death of the widow, and, further, that all accumulations of surplus income and of income thereon in respect of the said fund after January 26, 1930, and until the death of the said widow, is distributable as upon an intestacy, viz., one-third to the widow and one-third to each of the estates of the two deceased sons.\nAnother of the nine beneficiaries named in paragraph 15, Belle Marks, died in 1911, leaving surviving three children, who are represented by counsel on this appeal together with the remaining seven beneficiaries named in the said paragraph. These all submit that the judgment of the Court of Appeal is right. The respondent, Fannie Hammond, the testator\u2019s widow, takes the same position. The Royal Trust Co., as the executor and trustee of the estate of the younger son, Herbert R. Hammond, contends that the judgment of the Court of Appeal is correct with respect to the surplus income and income thereon which has accumulated from and after January 26, 1930, and with respect to the income which will hereafter accumulate thereon, and submits its rights to this Court as to the disposition of the surplus income which has accumulated in the 21-year period from the death of the testator, viz., January 26, 1909, to January 26, 1930.\nAs previously pointed out, this Court has already decided that the testator\u2019s two sons upon the death of the testator took a vested interest in the second half of the residuary estate disposed of in paragraph 15 of the will, subject to partial defeasance. Whether or not the gift to the nine beneficiaries named, or their issue, who should be living at the time of the death of the testator\u2019s widow, constituted an executory bequest which should not vest in any of them until the death of the widow, we have no doubt, from the language used, that the testator meant to provide for the distribution at that time of the entire second half of the residue of his estate as it should then stand, including all the accumulation of surplus income and of income thereon. In the absence of any specific direction to that effect, that is, we think, the clear implication to be gathered from the entire will. It is the implication as well which the law, failing any words indicating an intention on the part of the testator to exclude it, would itself annex to the gift, whether the gift be one which vests in the beneficiaries on the testator\u2019s death or an executory bequest vesting only on the death of the testator\u2019s widow. As pointed out by Mr. Justice Middleton in his reasons for judgment, Lord Davey in Wharton v. Masterman[4], stated the law as follows:\u2014\nWhen there is no express trust declared of the income of a trust fund, it follows the destination of, and is an accretion to, the fund from which it is derived (unless there be words excluding that implication). And, applying it to the case then under consideration, added:\u2014\nBut the source of the income in question is the investments of the surplus income; so that, even if it be not impliedly given by force of the term \u201caccumulations,\u201d it would go in the same way as the investments of the surplus income, i.e., to the charities.\nIn the same case, Lord Chancellor Herschell used these words[5]:\u2014\nIt is true that there is no provision for the investment of the income derived from the accumulation of the surplus income, unless it be deduced from the use of the word \u201caccumulation\u201d in the clause which precedes the ultimate trust; but, whether this be so or not, I think the income arising from the investment of surplus income must, in the absence of any direction to the contrary, follow the destination of the investments from which it results.\nMr. Justice Middleton also quotes a dictum of Lord Chancellor Westbury in Bective v. Hodgson[6], treating of the distinction between executory devises of land and executory bequests of personal estate, in which he refers to \u201crules which have been very long established\u201d as to each. The rule of law regarding executory devises of real estate, he says,\nhas no application to bequests of personal estate. Consequently, if by a will the whole of the personal estate, or the residue of the personal estate, be the subject of an executory bequest, the income of such personal estate follows the principal as an accessory, and must, during the period which the law allows for accumulation, be accumulated and added to the principal. Subject to the prohibition against accumulation, the ownership both of the principal and interest of the personal estate so bequeathed, may remain in suspense until the executory bequest takes effect, provided it be so given as that it must vest within the time allowed by the rule against perpetuities. In the case of personal estate, the policy of the law does not require that there should always be a representative of the beneficial ownership.\nThese pronouncements, in our view, settle the question as to the surplus income of the second half of the residuary estate falling into and forming part of that half of the residuary estate disposed of by paragraph 15 of the will, as propounded by interrogatory no. 1.\nIn the events which have happened and in the circumstances which now exist, however, the accumulations from the second half of the residuary estate have gone beyond the period allowed by the Accumulations Act of Ontario, i.e., beyond twenty-one years following the death of the testator. To that extent, therefore, the direction for accumulation is void, so that that portion of the surplus income and the interest thereon, which has accumulated since January 26, 1930, is distributable as if the testator had died intestate in respect thereof. Such we think is the effect of that Act, which provides by s. 1(1) that:\u2014\nNo person shall, by any deed, surrender, will, codicil, or otherwise howsoever, settle or dispose of any real or personal property so that the rents, issues, profits or produce thereof shall be wholly or partially accumulated for any longer than one of the following terms:\u2014\n(One of these terms is, \u201c(b) for twenty-one years from the death of the grantor or testator\u201d); and by s. 1(3) that:\u2014\nWhere an accumulation is directed otherwise than as aforesaid, such direction shall be null and void, and the rents, issues, profits and produce of such property so directed to be accumulated shall, so long as the same shall be directed to be accumulated contrary to the provisions of this Act, go to and be received by such person as would have been entitled thereto, if such accumulation had not been directed.\nThe testator having, by virtue of these provisions of the Accumulations Act, died intestate in respect of all income accumulating after the lapse of twenty-one years following his death, it follows that such income is now divisible under the Devolution of Estates Act between his widow and the estates of his two deceased sons, who were at the time of his death the testator\u2019s next of kin and in whom as such, together with his widow, the inchoate right to such income, when it should accumulate, then vested\u2014one-third thereof to the widow and one\u2011third to each of the estates of the said two deceased sons. This, we take it, is the effect of the judgment of the Appeal Court as to all the accumulations of surplus income and the income thereon which have accrued since January 26, 1930.\nThe appeal should be dismissed and the costs of appeal of all parties, except the appellant, paid out of the estate of Herbert Carlyle Hammond, those of the executor and trustee of the said estate being taxed as between solicitor and client.\nAppeal dismissed.

The respondent claimed an amount of $318.25, total of expenses incurred as a consequence of that accident, and a sum of $20,000 for loss of time and total incapacity.\nThe appellant pleaded specially that the accident was due to the fault and negligence of the proprietor and driver of the automobile who was driving his car at an excessive speed, and in a manner not allowed by law under the circumstances; that especially the road-roller was in the old road, closed to circulation by good and solid barrier and was completely outside of the way that the travelling public should follow; that the closing of the old road and the opening of a temporary road were indicated to the travelling public by a red flag placed at more than 400 feet from the site of the accident, by a similar flag put on the steamroller and at the same time by a lighted lantern placed on the same roller. The Superior Court maintained respondent\u2019s action for a sum of $3,515.55, which judgment was affirmed on appeal, less a sum of $100 owing to an error in adding up the amounts of damages.\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. and L. Galipeault for the appellant.\nRosaire Beaudoin K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCannon J.\u2014A la suite de la collision d\u2019un automobile avec un rouleau \u00e0 vapeur, sur la route nationale Levis-Jackman, le 17 octobre 1931, l\u2019intim\u00e9, par p\u00e9tition de droit all\u00e9guant la n\u00e9gligence du d\u00e9partement de la voirie de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, a obtenu de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure (Gibsone, J.) une indemnit\u00e9 de $3,515.55. Sur appel de la Couronne, la Cour du Banc du Roi, par son jugement du 30 novembre 1934, a confirm\u00e9 le jugement, Hall J. dissident, tout en le r\u00e9duisant de $100 pour corriger une erreur d\u2019addition. Comme il s\u2019agit purement et simplement d\u2019une question de faits que les deux cours ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9e en faveur de l\u2019intim\u00e9, l\u2019appelant, devant nous, a born\u00e9 exclusivement son recours \u00e0 des moyens de droit. I\nNous r\u00e9f\u00e9rant au t\u00e9moignage de Joseph Gilbert, la Couronne a pr\u00e9tendu que le rouleau de fer, dont la pr\u00e9sence a amen\u00e9 la collision, appartenait aux d\u00e9nomm\u00e9s B\u00e9noni Poulin et Marcotte (les contracteurs), qui l\u2019avaient d\u00e9pos\u00e9 depuis trois jours sur le chemin public alors en r\u00e9paration.\nQuoique cette preuve ait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par l\u2019intim\u00e9, je partage l\u2019opinion de l\u2019honorable juge L\u00e9tourneau que, dans la contestation comme au cours de l\u2019enqu\u00eate, l\u2019on a sembl\u00e9 prendre pour acquis qu\u2019il \u00e9tait l\u00e0 pour les r\u00e9parations qui s\u2019y poursuivaient. A tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, le rouleau avait \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9, tol\u00e9r\u00e9, et, lors de l\u2019accident, \u00e9tait sur le chantier des travaux; de plus, il appert au plaidoyer que le d\u00e9partement en avait assum\u00e9 la garde et le contr\u00f4le, et cette particularit\u00e9 suffit pour que la responsabilit\u00e9 du ma\u00eetre des travaux (dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la Couronne) doive en r\u00e9sulter.\nII\nLe second point soulev\u00e9 par la Couronne est bas\u00e9 sur l\u2019article 106 du chapitre 91 des statuts refondus de la povince de Qu\u00e9bec de 1925, tel que remplac\u00e9 par 17 Geo, V (1927), c 31, s. 22, qui se lit comme suit:\n106. The municipal corporation, owner of a road which the Minister of -Roads maintains or upon which he does construction or improvement work, shall not be responsible for damages due to the fault of employees of the Minister of Roads, committed in the discharge of their duties, nor to any default in the fulfilment of the obligations imposed on the province or undertaken by the Minister of Roads under any provision of this Act. Such corporation shall) retain its rights and control over such road subject to the restrictions created by this Act and it shall continue to have, with regard to such roads, all obligations toward the public which the law imposes upon it, save those which are removed by this Act.\nEncore sur ce point, je crois, avec l\u2019honorable juge L\u00e9tourneau, qu\u2019il est possible que, d\u2019une fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, la garde d\u2019une route, et l\u2019obligation d\u2019en faire dispara\u00eetre les obstacles, reviennent aux municipalit\u00e9s; mais dans un cas comme dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce actuelle, o\u00f9 le d\u00e9partement s\u2019en est empar\u00e9 pour les travaux de son ressort, il faut maintenir le principe que la responsabilit\u00e9 suit le contr\u00f4le. Cette disposition, d\u2019ailleurs, semble, implicitement du moins, d\u00e9cr\u00e9ter la responsabilit\u00e9 en dommages du gouvernement. Or ce rouleau \u00e9tail certainement sur le chantier organis\u00e9 par le d\u00e9partement de la voirie et, d\u2019apr\u00e8s les plaidoiries, sous la garde de ses employ\u00e9s qui en auraient indiqu\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sence un public voyageur par un pavillon rouge plac\u00e9 \u00e0 quatre cents pieds de l\u2019endroit de l\u2019accident et par un autre pavillon semblable plac\u00e9 sur le rouleau \u00e0 vapeur, en m\u00eame temps qu\u2019un fanal allum\u00e9, plac\u00e9 sur le m\u00eame rouleau, \u00e9clairant tr\u00e8s bien. Ce sont l\u00e0 les pr\u00e9tentions de la d\u00e9fense qui, d\u2019apr\u00e8s les jugements des cours inf\u00e9rieures, n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9es, pas plus que les actes de n\u00e9gligence reproch\u00e9s au conducteur de l\u2019automobile.\nIII\nMais, nous dit en troisi\u00e8me lieu l\u2019avocat de l\u2019appelant soulevant un point qui ne semble pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 du tout plaid\u00e9 ou consid\u00e9r\u00e9 devant les cours inf\u00e9rieures, la loi 46 Vict. (1883), c. 27, reproduite \u00e0 l\u2019article 1011 du Code de Proc\u00e9dure Civile, ne donne pas un recours illimit\u00e9 contre la Couronne pour d\u00e9lit ou quasi-d\u00e9lit. Cette disposition se lit comme suit:\nAny person having a claim to exercise against the government of this province, whether it be a revendication of moveable or immoveable property, or a claim for payment of money on an alleged! contract, or for damages, or otherwise, may address his petition of right to His Majesty.\nDans cette cause, la Couronne ne semble pas avoir mis en doute, d\u2019apr\u00e8s les plaidoiries, sa responsabilit\u00e9 pour les actes ou omissions des employ\u00e9s de la voirie. Ceci est d\u2019ailleurs conforme \u00e0 la pratique dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec depuis que cet acte de 1883 a \u00e9t\u00e9 pass\u00e9. Ses dispositions sont plus g\u00e9n\u00e9reuses que celles de la Loi de la Cour d\u2019Echiquier du Canada qu\u2019il nous a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 de discuter r\u00e9cemment re: The King v. Dubois[1]. Il semble que la l\u00e9gislature de Qu\u00e9bec se soit inspir\u00e9e de la Crown Suits Ordinance XV de 1876, section 18, sous-section 2, se lisant comme suit:\nAny claim against the Crown founded on the use or occupation, or right to use or occupation, of Crown lands in the Colony, and any claim arising out of the revenue laws, or out of any contract entered into, or which should have or might have been entered into, on behalf of the Crown, by or by the authority of the Government of the Colony, which would, if such claim had arisen between subject and subject, be the ground of an action at law, or suit in equity, and any claim against the Crown for damages or compensation arising in the Colony, shall be a claim cognizable under this Ordinance.\nCe texte a \u00e9t\u00e9 discut\u00e9 par le Conseil Priv\u00e9 re: Attorney-General of the Straits Settlements v. Wemyss[2], o\u00f9 Lord Hobhouse s\u2019exprime comme suit: Their Lordships are of opinion that the expression \u201ca claim against the Crown for damages or compensation\u201d is an apt expression to include claims arising out of torts,, and that as claims arising out of contracts and other classes of claims are expressly mentioned, the words ought to receive their full meaning.\nIn the case of Farnell v. Bowman (1) attention was directed by this Committee to the fact that in many colonies the Crown was in the habit of undertaking works which, in England, are usually performed by private persons, and to the consequent expediency of providing remedies for injuries committed in the course of these works. The present case is an illustration of that remark. And there is no improbability, but the reverse, that when the legislature of a Colony in such circumstances allows claims against the Crown in words applicable to claims upon torts, it should mean exactly what it expresses.\nD\u2019ailleurs, m\u00eame sans cette autorit\u00e9, nous croirions devoir suivre la coutume accept\u00e9e depuis un grand nombre d\u2019ann\u00e9es dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec et interpr\u00e9ter cet article 1011 C.P.C. comme cr\u00e9ant un droit d\u2019action contre la Couronne dans les cas de d\u00e9lits et de quasi-d\u00e9lits, en suivant les formalit\u00e9s de la p\u00e9tition de droit (Vo. Rapport des codificateurs, nov. 1896\u2014C.C.P. (Surveyer) 93).\nPour ces raisons, je suis d\u2019avis de renvoyer l\u2019appel avec d\u00e9pens. Le demandeur cependant n\u2019a droit aux int\u00e9r\u00eats que depuis la date du jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure qui devra \u00eatre modifi\u00e9 en cons\u00e9quence.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Galipeault & Galipeault.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Rosaire Beaudoin.\n[1] [1934] S.C.R. 378.\n[2] (1888) 13 App. Cas. 192, at 197.\n",

Plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal must be dismissed. By reason of said change in circumstances, the objections to granting relief by way of rescission were insurmountable; and a claim for relief by way of damages (as to damages no evidence had been given), or otherwise except on the basis of the setting aside of the impeached transaction, not having been presented either at the trial or in the Court of Appeal, could not properly be entertained by this Court; defendant should not be called upon in this Court to meet an entirely new case unless, at all events, it rested exclusively upon propositions of law, and unless, moreover, it appeared that he could not be prejudiced by its not having been advanced at an earlier stage.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiffs from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], which (reversing the judgment of Hope J.) dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 action.\nThe action was brought to recover from the defendant certain moneys paid by the plaintiff Dominion Royalty Corporation Ltd. (incorporated 1930) (hereinafter called the plaintiff company) as the purchase price of a certain interest in a gas and oil lease covering lands in the State of Oklahoma, U.S.A.\nThe Court of Appeal, while holding that the defendant was the real vendor to the plaintiff company of said interest; that the defendant stood in such a fiduciary relationship to the plaintiff company as required him to make full and complete disclosure of the material circumstances in connection with the transaction in question; that he failed to make that full and complete disclosure; and that on these facts, taken by themselves, the plaintiff company had had a good cause of action for rescission, yet held that, as, through what had since taken place, the circumstances had changed and had become such that the plaintiff company could not make restitutio in integrum, its right of action for rescission had gone, and that, as it had not framed or pursued the action for any relief except relief on the basis of rescission, the action must be dismissed. The material facts and circumstances of the case are dealt with at length in the reasons for the judgment appealed from[2].\nBy the judgment now reported the appeal to this Court was dismissed with costs.\nR.S. Robertson K.C. for the appellants.\nJ.S. Denison K.C. and F.T. Watson for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDUFF C.J.\u2014I agree with the unanimous view of the Court of Appeal for Ontario that, by reason of the change in circumstances, the objections to granting relief by way of rescission are insurmountable; no purpose would be served in merely repeating the reasons given in the judgments of Mr. Justice Masten and Mr. Justice Davis. On this account, the appeal should be dismissed.\nNo claim for relief by way of damages or equitable compensation, or to recover the moneys paid to Goffatt as moneys had and received to the use of the appellants, as distinguished from the claim for the restoration of those moneys (with interest), as consequential upon the setting aside of the impeached transaction, was presented either at the trial or in the Court of Appeal. No evidence as to damages was given. The sole title to relief advanced by the appellants was that the transaction with Goffatt was voidable and that Goffatt was bound at their demand to make restitutio in integrum.\nIn these circumstances, no claim for damages, or for equitable compensation, could properly be entertained by this Court. Similar considerations apply to the contention put forward that the appellants are entitled to recover the moneys paid to Goffatt as moneys had and received to their use; but, indeed, it seems too clear for argument that effect could only be given to such a claim if the impeached transaction were set aside. The appellants are bound by the way in which they conducted their case at the trial and in the Court of Appeal, and it would be contrary to well-settled principles to call upon the respondent in this Court to meet an entirely new case unless, at all events, that case rested exclusively upon propositions of law, and unless, moreover, it appeared that the respondent could not be prejudiced by the fact that it was not advanced at an earlier stage. The appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Fasken, Robertson, Aitchison, Pickup & Calvin.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Slaght & Cowan.\n[1] [1935] O.R. 169; [1935] 1 D.L.R. 780.\n[2] [1935] O.R. 169; [1935] 1 D.L.R. 780.\n",

Respondent moved to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction, on the grounds that the judgment appealed from was not a final judgment, and that it was in exercise of judicial discretion within s. 38 of the Supreme Court Act.\nHeld: The Court had jurisdiction to hear the appeal, and the motion to quash should be dismissed.\nThe jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Canada in respect of appeals in exercise of a right of appeal given by the Exchequer Court Act is not affected by s. 38 of the Supreme Court Act. S. 38 is limited in its application to those cases in respect of which the jurisdiction is set forth and denned immediately or referentially by the Supreme Court Act. The judgment appealed from was a final judgment within the meaning of s. 82 (4) of the Exchequer Court Act.\nThe case was not one in which the Court\u2019s power to dismiss summarily an appeal should be exercised.\nMOTION to quash appeal for want of jurisdiction on the grounds that the judgment appealed from was not a final judgment, and that it was in exercise of judicial discretion within s. 38 of the Supreme Court Act,\nThe action was by way of petition of right in the Exchequer Court of Canada, for repayment of certain moneys alleged to have been paid by the suppliant to the Department of Customs and Excise and to the Department of National Revenue of the Dominion of Canada as an excise tax and as a sales or consumption tax on ale and beer manufactured for export and duly exported, the imposition and collection of which taxes, it was alleged, was not authorized.\nThe action was set down for trial before the President of the Exchequer Court at Toronto for February 19, 1935.\nOn February 11, 1935, counsel for the suppliant moved before the President of the Exchequer Court to postpone the trial on the ground that some of suppliant\u2019s witnesses were ill, and others who resided in the United States were not available as such for the trial on February 19. That motion was enlarged to the trial.\nOn February 16, 1935, counsel for the suppliant again applied to the President for a postponement of the trial, and the President again directed that the application be heard at the trial on February 19.\nAt the opening of the trial on February 19, counsel for the suppliant again presented his application for a postponement of the trial, and the President directed that the suppliant must move to set the case down for trial within sixty days from that date, and that the trial must take place and be concluded before the summer vacation.\nOn May 15, 1935, the case came on for trial before the President of the Exchequer Court at Toronto, and the suppliant again sought an adjournment until the middle of October on the ground that the witnesses that the suppliant counted on to be available were in the United States and their attendance could not be forced, and that the suppliant had been unable to get them to agree to be present at the trial in Toronto before the middle of October.\nThe request for adjournment was refused, and as counsel for the suppliant stated that he was not prepared to proceed with the trial, the petition of right was dismissed with costs.\nThe suppliant appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, and the respondent launched the present motion to quash the appeal.\nA. C. Hill K.C. for the motion.\nO. M. Biggar K.C. contra.\nThe Court.\u2014The grounds of the motion are: first, that the judgment appealed from is not a final judgment; and, second, that the jurisdiction of this Court is excluded by section 38 of the Supreme Court Act.\nBy section 35 of the Supreme Court Act,\nThe Supreme Court shall have, hold and exercise an appellate, civil and criminal jurisdiction within and throughout Canada;\nand, by section 44,\nNotwithstanding anything in this Act contained the court shall also have jurisdiction as provided in any other Act conferring jurisdiction.\nThe appellate jurisdiction, bestowed upon the Supreme Court in general terms by section 35 of the Supreme Court Act, is, in point of fact, defined in part by the Supreme Court Act itself, and, in part, by other statutes, for example, the Criminal Code and the Controverted Elections Act.\nAs regards appeals from the Exchequer Court, the right of appeal is given by section 82 of the Exchequer Court Act; and it is contended on behalf of the Crown that section 38 of the Supreme Court Act applies to such appeals. In our opinion, the jurisdiction of this Court in respect of appeals in exercise of a right of appeal given by the Exchequer Court Act is not affected by section 38 of the Supreme Court Act; which section, we think, is limited in its application to those cases in respect of which the jurisdiction is set forth and defined immediately or referentially by the Supreme Court Act.\nWe are also of opinion that the judgment appealed from is a final judgment. The formal judgment is in these words:\u2014 This action, by way of Petition of Right, having come on for trial before this Court at the City of Toronto on the 19th day of February, A.D. 1935, in presence of counsel for the Suppliant and for the Respondent and having been adjourned, and again coming on this day before this Court in the said City of Toronto in presence of counsel for the Suppliant and for the Respondent, upon hearing what was alleged by counsel aforesaid, counsel for the Suppliant declaring that it was not prepared to proceed and asked for an adjournment of the trial.\nThis court doth order and adjudge that the Petition of Right herein be and the same is hereby dismissed.\nAnd this court doth further order and adjudge that His Majesty the King is entitled to recover from the Suppliant His costs of the present action, after taxation thereof.\nThis is a judgment at the trial of the action dismissing it. True, as the suppliant was not prepared to prove his case, the matter of substance considered by the trial judge was whether or not the trial should be adjourned in order to give the suppliant a further opportunity to produce evidence. Nevertheless, it is a judgment pronounced at a trial, both parties being present, after the suppliant, on whom the burden of proof lay, had declared he had no evidence to offer. Such a judgment, we have no doubt, is a final judgment within the meaning of section 82, subsection 4, of the Exchequer Court Act.\nThe contention of the Crown, therefore, on both of the grounds on which it is rested, that the appeal should be quashed for want of jurisdiction, fails. We do not think this a case in which the power of summarily dismissing an appeal, which the Court has on rare occasions exercised where there is no lack of competence to dispose of it on the merits, ought to be put into execution. Appeals have been summarily dismissed where the appellant was held, exceptione personally to be demonstrably precluded by his conduct from prosecuting the appeal (Schlomann v. Dowker[1]); where, by reason of some change in circumstances, the actual interest of the appellant in the appeal had disappeared, except as regards the costs, and in other similar cases (Moir v. Village of Huntingdon[2]; McKay v. Township of Hinchinbrooke[3]; Martley v. Carson[4]). The procedure followed in these cases is not, we think, a convenient procedure in cases such as this.\nThe motion is dismissed with costs.\nMotion dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: McLarty & Fraser.\nSolicitor for the respondent: A.

Murray, [1935] S.C.R. 572\nDate: 1935-11-22\nGeorge D. Mcmillan (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nAnnie Murray (Plaintiff) Respondent\n1935: October 28; 1935: November 22.\nPresent:\u2014Duff C.J. and Rinfret, Lamont, Davis and Kerwin JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA\nMotor vehicles\u2014Negligence\u2014Pedestrian struck by motor car\u2014Statutory onus of proof that damage did not arise through driver's negligence (Vehicles and Highway Traffic Act, Alta., 1924, c. 31, s. 66)\u2014Meeting the onus\u2014Effect of establishing contributory negligence. Plaintiff, while walking easterly along the roadway (the sidewalks being in bad condition) of a street in Edmonton, Alberta, at 7.25 p.m. on March 11, 1934, was struck, four or five feet from the south (right hand) curb, by a motor car driven easterly by defendant. The evening was dark and the pavement wet. Defendant had been driving cautiously and watching for pedestrians. To avoid a motor which was meeting him, he turned towards the south curb. The glare of the other car's lights prevented him, for a moment or so, from seeing what was ahead of him. As soon as he was out of the glare he saw plaintiff about eight feet ahead of him. He immediately turned his car to the left, shut off the motor and applied his brakes, but struck her. Plaintiff's action for damages was dismissed by Ford J. ([1935] 2 W.W.R. 47), who found that defendant had satisfied the onus placed upon him by s. 66 of the Vehicles and Highway Traffic Act (1924, Alta., c. 31) and, on the evidence, did not in fact cause the accident by his negligence. This judgment was reversed by the Appellate Division, Alta. Defendant appealed.\nHeld: There was ample evidence to support the trial judge's finding; there was no ground upon which his judgment should be set aside; and it should be restored. (Per Duff C.J.: There was no ground in the circumstances for attributing negligence to plaintiff. The real question for the trial judge was whether or not defendant had acquitted himself of the statutory onus. On the record it would seem that defendant had shown that, in the situation which confronted him, he had not failed in that standard of care, skill and judgment which can fairly and properly be required of the driver of a motor vehicle; if there was a mistake of judgment on his part, it was an excusable mistake, and the most unfortunate misadventure was an accident; the standards to be applied are not standards of perfection. In this view, the finding of the trial judge, who had the opportunity of observing defendant under cross-examination, ought not to be disturbed).\nPoole & Thompson Ltd. v. McNally, [1934] Can. S.C.R. 717 (referred to in argument and in the judgments below) discussed and explained. Under the enactment as to onus there dealt with (s. 65(1) of the Prince Edward Island Highway Traffic Act, in substance the same, in the pertinent respects, as that now in question), standing by itself, the defendant may acquit himself of the onus cast upon him, by establishing that the plaintiff's negligence materially contributed to the mishap, and that he could not, in the result, by the exercise of reasonable care, have avoided the consequences of that negligence; or that the mischief was directly caused by the negligence of the plaintiff as well as that of himself co-operating together. The enactment does not itself appear to aim at altering the substantive rules of common law touching the effect of contributory negligence; its purpose seems to be to change the law as to the burden of proof, as explained in Winnipeg Electric Co. v. Geel, [1931] Can. S.C.R. 443; [1932] A.C. 690.\nAPPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1] which gave judgment for the plaintiff for damages, reversing the judgment of Ford J.[2] who dismissed the plaintiff's action, which was brought to recover damages for injuries received when plaintiff was struck by defendant's motor car. The material facts and circumstances of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment of Davis J. now reported. The appeal to this Court was allowed and the judgment of the trial judge restored with costs throughout.\nG. B. O'Connor, K.C., for the appellant.\nR. D. Tighe, K.C., for the respondent.\nDUFF C.J.\u2014I concur entirely with the conclusion as well as with the reasoning of the judgment of the Court delivered by Mr. Justice Davis.\nI should not have thought it necessary to supplement those reasons had it not been for the reference to the judgment of this Court in the case of Poole & Thompson Ltd. v. McNally[3] in the judgments below and on the argument before us.\nA word, first of all, as to the present case. I see no ground in the circumstances for attributing negligence to the respondent. The real question for the trial judge was whether or not the appellant had acquitted himself of the statutable onus. On the record alone, as we have it before us, I should have thought the appellant had shown that, in the situation which confronted him, he had not failed in that standard of care, skill and judgment which can fairly and properly be required of the driver of a motor vehicle. In other words, I should have thought that if there was a mistake of judgment on his part, it was an excusable mistake and that the most unfortunate misadventure was an accident. The standards to be applied are not standards of perfection.\nIn this view, the finding of the trial judge, who had the opportunity of observing the appellant under cross-examination, ought not, I think, to be disturbed.\nAs to Poole & Thompson Ltd. v. McNally[4], the sole question left to the jury in that case by the judge at the trial was the question of the identity of the motor vehicle which had caused the injury of which the plaintiff complained. Admittedly, this vehicle was not brought to a stop after running into the plaintiff, and a debatable question, no doubt, arose upon the evidence whether the plaintiff had discharged the onus resting upon him to establish that the vehicle was the defendants'. The learned trial judge said to the jury:\nI am requested by counsel for Poole & Thompson Limited to direct \"that the onus is on the plaintiff of establishing that the defendants' car caused the accident.\" The plaintiff must establish that the defendants' car caused the accident. I think I made that clear to you. If you come to the conclusion that the defendants' car caused the accident, you will bring in a verdict for the plaintiff; otherwise your verdict will be for the defendants.\nNo question was raised at the trial as to the construction of the statute (section 654 of the Prince Edward Island Highway Traffic Act of 1930) which, in the pertinent respects, is in substance in the same terms as those of the Alberta statute; nor was any question of contributory negligence raised or submitted to the jury; although a plea of contributory negligence was put in the statement of defence. Counsel for the defendants had, indeed, very good reasons for not asking to have any such issue submitted to the jury. The person who was driving the defendants' vehicle denied that he had come into collision with anybody. It was plainly one of those cases in which the party appealing had elected to rest upon a particular issue and take his chances of success with the jury on that issue. In the judgment of this Court, at p. 724, this is pointed out; and it is also laid down that a finding of contributary negligence against the plaintiff would not have been a reasonable finding. There was not, at the pertinent time, in force in Prince Edward Island any contributory negligence statute of the type which prevails in several provinces providing for apportionment of loss according to the comparative degree of fault.\nWe do not think that the passage in the judgment of the Court at pp. 722-3, dealing with the construction and effect of the Highway Traffic Act (for which, I need, perhaps, hardly say, both in its form and substance, I accept the fullest responsibility), should be regarded as constituting part of the ratio decidendi.\nWe think that, under the statute, standing by itself, the defendant may acquit himself of the onus cast upon him by establishing that the plaintiff's negligence materially contributed to the mishap, and that he could not, in the result, by the exercise of reasonable care, have avoided the consequences of that negligence; or that the mischief was directly caused by the negligence of the plaintiff as well as that of himself co-operating together.\nI prefer the use of the phrase \"directly caused\" in preference to such phrases as \"proximate cause,\" \"causa causans,\" \"effective cause,\" for the reasons given by Lord Sumner in Weld-Blundell v. Stephens[5].\nSubsection one of section 65 of the Highway Traffic Act does not itself appear to aim at altering the substantive rules of common law touching the effect of contributory negligence. The purpose of the statute seems to be to change the law as to the burden of proof, as explained in Winnipeg Electric Co. v. Geel[6].\nDAVIS J. (all the other members of the Court concurring).\u2014The respondent brought an action against the appellant in the Supreme Court of Alberta for damages which she claimed to have suffered by reason of being struck by the appellant's automobile on the south side of 84th Avenue in the City of Edmonton on Sunday, March 11, 1934, at about 7.25 p.m. On the evening in question the respondent, a married woman slightly over 60 years of age, was walking from her home, about a block west of the scene of the accident, along 84th Avenue in an easterly direction towards St. Anthony's Church, which is about a block east of the scene of the accident. It was a dark night and the pavement was wet. When the respondent left her house on the south side of the avenue she crossed to the north side, but, finding the sidewalk on that side too slippery, returned to the south side. But she could not walk on the sidewalk on the south side because it was just a sheet of ice; she could not see the sidewalk at all, to quote her own words, and consequently she walked down the paved street, walking on the south side with, not against, the eastbound traffic. She says she kept as close to the south curb as she could but when she was struck she was four or five feet out from the curb. She says she did not walk on the north side of the paved street because mud from an excavation had covered part of the boulevard and had come down on to the street. The respondent says she cannot recall anything about the accident, but remembers seeing other people walking on the paved street.\nThe appellant was driving his car easterly along 84th Avenue to the Metropolitan Church, which is about three blocks further east from the place of the accident, driving in the same direction as the respondent was walking. He appears to have been driving cautiously about fifteen or twenty miles an hour and, as he had been driving down the same avenue to church on Sunday evenings for about eight years and had seen people walking on the street at that place and time, he was watching for pedestrians who might be on the street. Another motor vehicle, travelling in the opposite direction, approached him, and, to avoid the oncoming car, he turned towards the south curb. The glare of the lights of the approaching car prevented him, for a moment or so, from seeing what was ahead of him. As soon as he was out of the glare of the lights of the other car he saw the respondent on the roadway about eight feet ahead of him. He immediately turned his car to the left, shut off the motor and applied his brakes. He felt sure he had cleared her but he heard a thud and pulled into the curb. The respondent was lying on the road about twelve feet behind the car. Her body was at a right angle to the curb, with her head towards the centre of the road.\nThe case came on for trial before Mr. Justice Ford, who delivered judgment in favour of the appellant, dismissing the respondent's action. The respondent appealed to the Court of Appeal of Alberta, who unanimously allowed the appeal and awarded the respondent $2,000 general damages and $552.22 special damages, making a total of $2,552.22. No written reasons for the judgment of the Court of Appeal were delivered and we are therefore without the benefit of the reasons stated by the learned Chief Justice at the conclusion of the argument.\nThe learned trial judge in a reserved judgment said that his further consideration of the evidence confirmed the view he formed at the hearing, that the appellant had satisfied the onus placed upon him by sec. 66 of The Vehicles and Highway Traffic Act, 1924, of Alberta[7], which reads as follows:\n66. When any loss or damage is sustained or incurred by any person by reason of a motor vehicle in motion, the onus of proof that such loss or damage did not arise through the negligence or improper conduct of the owner or driver of the motor vehicle shall be upon the owner or driver of the motor vehicle.\nThe evidence satisfied the learned trial judge that the appellant did not in fact cause the accident by his negligence. There was ample evidence to support this finding and there is no ground upon which the judgment at the trial should be set aside. We concur in the views expressed by the Chief Justice as to the case of Poole & Thompson Ltd. v. McNally[8].\nThe appeal is therefore allowed and the trial judgment restored with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\n[1] Noted in [1935] 3 W.W.R. 117 (no written reasons).\n[2] [1935] 2 W.W.R. 47.\n[3] [1934] Can.

Some years later, the appellant, being sued for taxes imposed for construction and maintenance of streets and sidewalks, brought the present action claiming that the by-laws enacting such taxes should be declared illegal and set aside, as far as he was concerned, on the ground that the municipal corporation had agreed to do at its own expenses the works for which the said taxes had been imposed upon him.\nHeld that the judgment appealed from, dismissing the appellant\u2019s action, should be affirmed.\nPer Lamont, Cannon, Crocket and Davis JJ.\u2014The by-law of the municipal corporation respondent, ratifying the agreement with the appellant, was radically null and illegal. Such agreement by the municipal corporation to consider as land under cultivation a property which according to the then existing laws was liable to taxation, was ultra vires. A municipal corporation, without special authority granted by the legislature, cannot renounce directly or indirectly its right, nor fail in its duty, to collect from assessable property the funds needed for general administration and for the performance of public works.

Si le conseil de ville d\u00e9cidait de m\u2019en exproprier, je lui demanderais de le faire au plus t\u00f4t; si, au contraire, il d\u00e9clarait, par r\u00e9solution, qu\u2019il n\u2019entend pas les exproprier et payer, je verrais \u00e0 les faire enclore et \u00e0 les livrer \u00e0 la culture.\nUne r\u00e9ponse imm\u00e9diate obligera beaucoup.\nVotre obt. serv.\nLouis Tellier.\nApr\u00e8s de nouveaux pourparlers, les parties pass\u00e8rent la convention du 20 septembre 1913, qui fut ratifi\u00e9e par une r\u00e9solution du conseil. Elle se lit comme suit:\nLesquelles parties nous ont dit et d\u00e9clar\u00e9: Que le dit Tellier est propri\u00e9taire du sol des rues et avenues telles qu\u2019ouvertes sur ses terrains dans le quartier num\u00e9ro cinq de la cit\u00e9 de St-Hyacinthe, savoir: des rues Ste-H\u00e9loise, Notre-Dame et St-Pierre et de l\u2019avenue Tellier,\u2014et que la cit\u00e9 de St-Hyacinthe d\u00e9sire, dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public avoir, sans indemnit\u00e9, la jouissance des dites rues et avenue ainsi ouvertes, des travaux de construction, de nivellement et d\u2019am\u00e9liorations qui faciliteraient l\u2019\u00e9tablissement et la concession de lots de ville sur les terrains avoisinants, appartenant au dit Louis Tellier.\u2014\nEn cons\u00e9quence les parties ont fait et arr\u00eat\u00e9 entre elles les conventions suivantes, savoir:\u2014\nLe dit Louis Tellier autorise, par les pr\u00e9sentes, la cit\u00e9 de St-Hyacinthe, qui s\u2019y oblige aussi par les pr\u00e9sentes, \u00e0 faire tous les travaux de construction, de nivellement et d\u2019am\u00e9liorations sur les dites rues et avenues telles qu\u2019ouvertes sur les terrains du comparant Louis Tellier, et ce, pour y \u00e9tablir d\u00e8s \u00e0 pr\u00e9sent, et y maintenir \u00e0 toujours de bons chemins et trottoirs, et au besoin, des services d\u2019eau et des canaux d\u2019\u00e9gouts, et pour y maintenir et entretenir les dits chemins et trottoirs, en toute saison dans un bon ordre, sans trous, cahots, orni\u00e8res, pentes, roches, embarras ou nuisances quelconques, avec garde-fous aux endroits dangereux, de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 rendre la circulation des voitures de toutes sortes et des pi\u00e9tons, facile de jour et de nuit, le tout \u00e0 la condition que la dite cit\u00e9 de St-Hyacinthe, soit responsable de tous les accidents et dommages qui pourraient arriver sur ces rues et avenue, et que le dit Louis Tellier en soit par elle tenu indemne:\u2014et aussi \u00e0 la condition que les terrains avoisinant ces rues et avenue et appartenant au comparant Louis Tellier soient toujours consid\u00e9r\u00e9s et traitas par la dite cit\u00e9 comme terre en culture jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019ils soient conc\u00e9d\u00e9s en lots de ville \u00e0 des tiers:\u2014et enfin \u00e0 la condition, en faveur de la cit\u00e9 de St-Hyacinthe, que le comparant, Louis Tellier, lui c\u00e8dera gratuitement le sol des dites rues et avenue et lui en passera titre, d\u00e8s que tous les terrains les avoisinant auront \u00e9t\u00e9 conc\u00e9d\u00e9s en lots de ville \u00e0 des tiers, et ce \u00e0 quoi il s\u2019oblige par les pr\u00e9sentes.\n* * * Les pr\u00e9sentes conventions devront \u00eatre ratifi\u00e9es sans d\u00e9lai par le conseil de la cit\u00e9 de St-Hyacinthe, \u00e0 peine de nullit\u00e9.\nL\u2019appelant all\u00e8gue, de plus, qu\u2019un contrat semblable a \u00e9t\u00e9 pass\u00e9 avec la succession Couillard-Despr\u00e9s, dont il a acquis les droits.\nL\u2019appelant a pr\u00e9tendu qu\u2019en vertu de la loi 51-52 Vict. c. 83, art. 93, alors en vigueur, ces propri\u00e9t\u00e9s, aussi longtemps qu\u2019il n\u2019en a pas dispos\u00e9, sont exempt\u00e9es de toutes taxes et cotisations; cependant, devant cette cour, son procureur a admis qu\u2019il ne pouvait r\u00e9ussir au sujet des taxes impos\u00e9es en vertu des r\u00e8glements 300, 319, 327, 334, 342, 347, 352, 384, 392, 402 et 404.\nCet article 93 d\u00e9cr\u00e8te:\nAfin de r\u00e9aliser les fonds n\u00e9cessaires pour faire face aux d\u00e9penses du conseil de ville et pour effectuer dans la cit\u00e9 les diverses am\u00e9liorations publiques n\u00e9cessaires, le conseil de ville aura le droit de pr\u00e9lever annuellement sur les personnes et les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s mobili\u00e8res et immobili\u00e8res de la cit\u00e9 les taxes ci-apr\u00e8s d\u00e9sign\u00e9es, savoir:\n1\u00b0 Sur tout terrain, lot de ville ou portion de lot, soit qu\u2019il existe ou non des b\u00e2timents, une somme n\u2019exc\u00e9dant pas trois quarts de centin dans la piastre sur sa valeur totale r\u00e9elle, telle que port\u00e9e au r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation de la cit\u00e9; mais nulle terre en culture ou afferm\u00e9e dans les limites de la cit\u00e9 ne sera tax\u00e9e en vertu du pr\u00e9sent acte, except\u00e9 l\u2019emplacement o\u00f9 les b\u00e2timents seront \u00e9rig\u00e9s, lequel sera \u00e9valu\u00e9 avec les dits b\u00e2timents.\nLe conseil de ville aura le droit de faire ajouter sur le r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation, en tout temps, par les assesseurs en office, sur l\u2019estimation par eux faite, toute partie de telle terre en culture qui en sera d\u00e9tach\u00e9e comme lot de ville et sera ainsi imposable apr\u00e8s la cl\u00f4ture du r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation et d\u2019exiger la taxe comme sur tous les autres terrains entr\u00e9s au dit r\u00f4le.\nIl r\u00e9sulte du contrat all\u00e9gu\u00e9, comme l\u2019a constat\u00e9 la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, que, d\u00e8s avant 1913, l\u2019appelant avait fait un cadastre particulier de ces immeubles qu\u2019il avait divis\u00e9s en lots de ville en vue d\u2019en faire la concession \u00e0 des tiers. M\u00eame si ces lots de ville \u00e9taient soumis \u00e0 la culture, ils n\u2019avaient plus le caract\u00e8re particulier exig\u00e9 par la loi pour b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de l\u2019exemption. Le demandeur lui-m\u00eame semble l\u2019avoir r\u00e9alis\u00e9, puisqu\u2019il a stipul\u00e9 dans la convention qu\u2019il invoque que les terrains avoisinant les rues et avenue lui appartenant seraient toujours trait\u00e9s et consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme terrains en culture jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019ils soient conc\u00e9d\u00e9s en lots de ville \u00e0 des tiers. Comme le dit monsieur le juge Saint-Jacques, le l\u00e9gislateur a voulu prot\u00e9ger le cultivateur dont la terre se trouvait dans les limites du territoire nouvellement annex\u00e9 \u00e0 la cit\u00e9; mais il n\u2019a pas voulu accorder le m\u00eame privil\u00e8ge et la m\u00eame exemption aux terrains qui, bien qu\u2019encore en culture, \u00e9taient devenus en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, des lots de ville d\u00e9j\u00e0 mis sur le march\u00e9. Le l\u00e9gislateur a m\u00eame eu soin de donner au conseil de ville le pouvoir d\u2019amender le r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation en tout temps pour y ajouter comme imposable toute partie de terre en culture qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9tach\u00e9e comme lots de ville et serait devenue imposable.\nCe fait important, admis par les deux cours, que, d\u00e8s avant 1913, les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s de l\u2019appelant \u00e9taient cadastr\u00e9es en lots de ville semble expliquer pourquoi l\u2019appelant, pour obtenir ce qu\u2019il pensait \u00eatre une consid\u00e9ration suffisante pour la valeur des terrains servant d\u2019assiette aux rues ouvertes et \u00e0 ouvrir, a stipul\u00e9 que la cit\u00e9 devrait \u00e0 l\u2019avenir traiter ses lots comme des terres en culture.\nLa r\u00e9solution du conseil acceptant cette stipulation lie-telle la corporation, ou est-elle entach\u00e9e, comme l\u2019a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 la Cour du Banc du Roi, d\u2019une nullit\u00e9 radicale? Cet engagement de consid\u00e9rer et traiter comme terrains en culture, et cons\u00e9quemment non imposables, des terrains qui effectivement, d\u2019apr\u00e8s la loi existante, \u00e9taient sujets \u00e0 l\u2019imp\u00f4t \u00e9taitil intra vires?\nIl me semble que poser la question c\u2019est la r\u00e9soudre. Sans une autorisation sp\u00e9ciale de la l\u00e9gislature, la corporation ne pouvait pas renoncer directement ou indirectement au droit, ni manquer au devoir, de pr\u00e9lever sur les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s imposables les fonds n\u00e9cessaires pour faire face aux d\u00e9penses du conseil et pour effectuer les diverses am\u00e9liorations publiques n\u00e9cessaires. La majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du Banc du Roi a cru que, dans les circonstances, la cause de Hampstead Land & Construction Co. vs. La ville de Hampstead et Hand[1] a \u00e9tabli un principe qui trouve ici son application:\nUne municipalit\u00e9 commet un exc\u00e8s de juridiction et un abus de pouvoir lorsqu\u2019elle stipule, comme consid\u00e9ration \u00e0 l\u2019achat d\u2019une lisi\u00e8re de terrain de l\u2019un de ses contribuables, l\u2019\u00e9valuation comme terre en culture et l\u2019exemption de taxes de ce terrain, et le contrat ainsi form\u00e9 est ill\u00e9gal et contraire \u00e0 l\u2019ordre public, fond\u00e9 qu\u2019il est sur une consid\u00e9ration vicieuse, prohib\u00e9e par la loi, ou contraire \u00e0 l\u2019ordre public.\nMais l\u2019appelant nous dit que le conseil de l\u2019intim\u00e9e avait le droit et les pouvoirs voulus d\u2019acqu\u00e9rir les terrains n\u00e9cessaires pour l\u2019ouverture de ces rues et qu\u2019il pouvait fournir la consid\u00e9ration accept\u00e9e par l\u2019appelant. En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cet argument, je r\u00e9p\u00e8te, comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait dans la cause de Hampstead[2], ce que dissait monsieur le juge Greenshields, re La Tuque v. Desbiens[3]:\nIt is within the powers of a municipality governed by the Cities and Towns\u2019 Act to acquire land to open a street; but if the mode of procedure to give effect to such a decision is clearly prescribed in the statute governing that municipality, that procedure should be followed, and, if the members of the council decide to follow a different procedure, they can certainly be said to be acting beyond their powers or outside their powers. And while the subject matter with which the council is dealing may be within their powers, their mode of dealing with the subject may be utterly illegal and void, and to that extent and in that sense, their act may be termed ultra vires.\nIl est bon de noter que dans l\u2019affaire Hampstead2, la Cour du Banc du Roi ayant refus\u00e9 permission d\u2019appeler, une nouvelle demande devant cette cour[4] fut refus\u00e9e pour entre autres, la raison suivante:\nwhile the statutory provision in question is of public importance, in the sense that it is of general application throughout the province of Quebec and deals with municipal matters, it is not suggested that its construction will affect any interest outside that province. It would seem, therefore, to be prima facie a proper subject for final determination by the provincial courts. La Corporation du Comt\u00e9 d\u2019Arthabaska v. La Corporation de Chester Est[5].\nQuant aux raisons d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 qui semblent avoir servi de base au jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, elles auraient d\u00fb \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9es devant les comit\u00e9s de la l\u00e9gislature. M\u00eame si nous pouvions accepter la pr\u00e9tention de l\u2019appelant que ses terrains sont encore des terres en culture, il n\u2019en reste pas moins vrai que, d\u00e8s 1913, en vertu de l\u2019article 138 de la charte de Saint-Hyacinthe, le conseil de ville avait le droit d\u2019imposer une taxe sp\u00e9ciale sur tous les propri\u00e9taires de terrains de la cit\u00e9 pour rencontrer les frais d\u2019ouverture et d\u2019entretien des rues, parties de rues, et construction et entretien des trottoirs, canaux ou \u00e9gouts, s\u2019il juge \u00e0 propos de s\u2019en charger, telle taxe devant \u00eatre bas\u00e9e sur le r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s, alors en vigueur; ce qui semblerait indiquer, comme le dit l\u2019honorable juge L\u00e9tourneau, que l\u2019article 93 n\u2019avait en vue que la taxe g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\nLa l\u00e9gislature, d\u2019ailleurs, en 1927, par le statut 17 Geo. V, c. 84, art. 11, a dit que, pour la cit\u00e9 intim\u00e9e, l\u2019article 522 de la Loi des Cit\u00e9s et Villes doit s\u2019appliquer avec la r\u00e9serve que pour elle. ces propri\u00e9t\u00e9s (toute terre en culture ou afferm\u00e9e, ou servant au p\u00e2turage des animaux, de m\u00eame que toute terre non d\u00e9frich\u00e9e ou terre \u00e0 bois dans les limites de la municipalit\u00e9) sont et ont toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 sujettes \u00e0 toute taxe impos\u00e9e pour la confection, le pavage et l\u2019entretien des chemins, rues, trottoirs et \u00e9gouts, et pour l\u2019\u00e9clairage des rues et places publiques.\nD\u2019ailleurs, il semble bien \u00e9tabli que les terrains de l\u2019appelant \u00e9taient, d\u00e8s 1913, soit des lots \u00e0 b\u00e2tir, et partant susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre impos\u00e9s pour la taxe g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, soit des lots en culture qui restaient soumis aux taxes sp\u00e9ciales pr\u00e9vues; et d\u00e8s lors, je crois, avec la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du Banc du Roi, qu\u2019il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 ill\u00e9gal de pr\u00e9tendre les mettre \u00e0 l\u2019abri par contrat. Il serait utile de consulter en cette cause la d\u00e9cision du Conseil Priv\u00e9, re: City of Montreal v. Montreal Industrial Land Company Ltd.[6], o\u00f9 il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une stipulation invoqu\u00e9e par la compagnie propri\u00e9taire, contenue dans la charte de la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, imposant l\u2019obligation de paver certaines rues aux frais de la cit\u00e9. Il y avait donc l\u00e0 plus qu\u2019une convention, mais un statut; et cependant le pouvoir de la l\u00e9gislature de changer la situation des propri\u00e9taires riverains et de les soumettre \u00e0 une taxe pour le pavage de cette m\u00eame rue n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en doute. Lord Wright s\u2019exprime ainsi, \u00e0 la page 706:\nIt is no doubt true that the statute of 1910 imposed an obligation on the appellant city, which was recognized from time to time by the statutory provisions extending the time for performance; it may be that the obligation represented in fact a bargain between the appellant city and the town which was annexed for the benefit of the town\u2019s inhabitants; but, however that may be, the obligation was embodied simply in the statute of the province, and the legislature which enacted that statute could repeal or modify it, even though to do so might appear inequitable. The question is whether the later legislation has repealed or modified the obligation.\nLa procureur de l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas insist\u00e9 devant nous sur la confirmation statutaire de la convention par le statut 5 Geo. V, c. 95, art. 4, qui a servi de base \u00e0 deux Consid\u00e9rants du jugement de premi\u00e8re instance. Les conventions qui devaient continuer \u00e0 avoir leur plein et entier effet en vertu de cette loi \u00e9tant les conventions r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement et l\u00e9galement pass\u00e9es par la cit\u00e9, et non pas un contrat comme celui qui nous occupe qui \u00e9tait \u00e9videmment ultra vires et entach\u00e9 d\u2019une nullit\u00e9 radicale. Nous ne rescindons pas le contrat; mais nous constatons qu\u2019il est inexistant. Il n\u2019est donc pas n\u00e9cessaire de r\u00e9tablir les parties dans la situation o\u00f9 elles \u00e9taient en 1913; et nous r\u00e9servons \u00e0 l\u2019appelant tous les recours qu\u2019il peut avoir et exercer contre l\u2019intim\u00e9e pour \u00eatre indemnis\u00e9 de la valeur de ses terrains servant d\u2019assiette aux rues de la cit\u00e9.\nL\u2019action et l\u2019appel doivent donc \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9s avec d\u00e9pens des trois cours contre l\u2019appelant.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Geoffrion & Prud\u2019homme.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Philippe Pothier.\n[1] (1028) Q.R. 44 K.B. 321.\n[2] (1928) Q.R. 44 K.B. 321.\n[3] (1929) Q.R. 30 K.B. 20, at 32.\n2 (1928) Q.R. 44 K.B. 321.\n[4] [1928] S.C.R. 428, at 431.\n[5] (1921) 63 Can.

Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 170)\u2014Whether employee entitled in law to benefit of s. 308\u2014Railway company\u2019s rules\u2014Failure to have headlight burning under stormy conditions in day-time\u2014Evidence\u2014Directions to jury\u2014Findings of jury.\nPlaintiff, a section foreman for defendant railway company, while walking westerly on the track in the course of his duty of inspection, about 11 o\u2019clock a.m. on a very cold and stormy winter\u2019s day, was struck by a special freight train of defendant coming behind him. He sued for damages. The accident occurred about 250 yards east of a highway level crossing, and west of the whistle post for that crossing. S. 308 of the Railway Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 170, and also defendant\u2019s rule 31, required the whistle to be sounded at least 80 rods before reaching the crossing and the bell to be rung continuously from the sounding of the whistle until the engine had crossed the highway. These requirements were apparently (and as the jury found) not observed on the occasion of the accident, the train engineer, though frequently during his journey sounding the whistle and bell, not being able under the stormy conditions to locate exactly the whistling posts. The trial judge charged the jury that the failure to comply with s. 308 was \u201cabsolute negligence in law,\u201d and that the jury was \u201cnot free to find anything else with respect to it.\u201d Defendant\u2019s rule 17 required that a headlight be displayed to the front of every train by night, and its rule 9 required that \u201cwhen weather or other conditions obscure day signals, night signals must be used in addition.\u201d The engine\u2019s headlight had been burning but was extinguished prior to the accident, the train men regarding it as useless owing to ice and snow on the glass and the storm\u2019s severity. The trial judge put the question of the headlight to the jury as a matter for them to deal with on the meaning of the words in defendant\u2019s rule book. The jury found that the accident was caused by defendant\u2019s negligence in \u201cno sounding of whistle, no bell ringing, no light in headlight of engine.\u201d Judgment was entered for plaintiff, which was reversed by the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan, which dismissed the action ([1934] 2 W.W.R. 24).\nHeld: There should be a new trial (Cannon and Crocket JJ., dissenting, would restore the judgment at trial).\nPer Duff C.J., Lamont and Davis JJ.: The said charge to the jury as to s. 308 was a misdirection.\nPer Duff C.J. and Davis J.: S. 308 was designed for the protection of persons on, or about to proceed on, a highway crossing at rail level, and was not intended for the protection of persons walking along the tracks mile after mile without any reference to highway crossings, and plaintiff, upon the facts of this case, was not entitled as a matter of law to the benefit of it (Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. Co. v. Mihas, 280 U.S. 102, and O\u2019Donnell v. Providence & Worcester Rd. Co., 6 R.I. 211, cited. Grand Trunk Ry. Co. v. Anderson, 28 Can. S.C.R. 541, and McMullin v. Nova Scotia Steel & Coal Co., 39 Can. S.C.R., 593, explained and distinguished). The jury\u2019s finding of negligence in respect of the failure to sound the whistle and bell was obviously based on the breach of s. 308 and said misdirection of the trial judge, and therefore could not be upheld. Their finding of negligence in respect of the headlight might fairly be attributed to the disobedience of defendant\u2019s rules; the evidence was merely guesswork as to whether or not the accident would have been avoided had the headlight been burning; and upon the evidence as it stands their finding of negligence in respect of the headlight could not be maintained. But, on the question of whether or not, quite apart from the statute, there was any negligence on defendant\u2019s part that caused the accident, the trial was very unsatisfactory, and there should be a new trial.\nPer Lamont J\u2019.: Plaintiff, as an employee on the track in performance of his duty, was one for whose benefit defendant\u2019s rules were made (reference made to a \u201cGeneral Notice\u201d in defendant\u2019s rule book, that \u201cobedience to the rules is essential to the safety of passengers and employees, and to the protection of property\u201d). As between plaintiff and defendant, the rules were as effective as the statuteand were evidence \u00f3f what defendant considered to be the exercise of due care. Plaintiff was injured through failure of defendant\u2019s servants to comply with, the rules, and in the absence of a finding, of justification or excuse for such\u2019 failure, he had a right of action. Whether or not what defendant did was a reasonable precaution against accident, whether or not under all\u2019 the circumstances plaintiff would have heard the whistle and bell if sounded; whether or not he would have seen the headlight if burning, were all for the jury to say. But, as it was impossible to tell whether the jury\u2019s finding as to whistle and bell was a finding of fact on the evidence or was induced by the trial judge\u2019s misdirection, there should be a new trial. Pet Cannon J. (dissenting): S. 308 would seem to protect railway employees as well as other persons (s. 419 (2) referred to in this connection). Besides, the action was based, not only on statutory duty, but also on common law negligence, and default in obeying defendant\u2019s rules; which rules were sufficient evidence of the care that should be taken. The jury\u2019s findings that the rules were not complied with, and that such non-compliance caused the accident, were based on sufficient evidence and should not be disturbed. Also the fact that plaintiff was not told, contrary to custom, before starting that day\u2019s inspection, that this extra train was coming, would aggravate defendant\u2019s imprudence in running it under such difficult weather conditions.\nPer Crocket J. (dissenting): All persons rightfully upon the railway track were entitled to the benefit of s. 308 (Grand Trunk Ry. Co. v. Anderson, 28 Can. S.C.R. 541, and McMullin v. Nova Scotia Steel & Coal Co., 39 Can. S.C.R. 593, cited); and plaintiff was entitled to rely on failure to sound whistle or bell in accordance with s. 308 as negligence, if that negligence was the direct cause of his injury. Plaintiff had a right to, and on the evidence he did, rely on compliance with defendant\u2019s rules as to whistle and bell. It was idle to suggest that, had they been sounded, he might not have heard them. The objection that the trial judge misdirected (as aforesaid) as to the effect of s. 308, was met by Grand Trunk Ry. Co. v. Anderson (supra) and his clear directions to the jury that, before defendant could be held liable through negligence by non-observance of the statutory requirements, they must be satisfied that the injury was the direct consequence of such negligence; and defendant was not prejudiced, nor was any substantial wrong or miscarriage occasioned, by the alleged misdirection. Defendant owed plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid injury to him. The plaintiff relied, throughout the case, on common law negligence as well as breach of statutory duty. The jury\u2019s finding of negligence in not using the headlight meant that, had it been on, as it should have been, it also would have warned plaintiff in time to enable him to avoid his injury; this was a finding upon a straight question \u00f3f fact, depending in very large measure upon the credibility of the trainmen\u2019s testimony; which credibility the jurors had a right to test by the light of their own experience and knowledge, or as inconsistent with indisputable facts or other testimony. Whether or not engine headlights are such signals as fall within the intendment of defendant\u2019s said rule 9, the evidence shewed that, when weather conditions were such as to obscure day signals, headlights were in fact used as additional warning signals, and the question was whether in the existing circumstances it was negligence (causing the injury) to turn it off.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[1] which (reversing the judgment of Embury J. in favour of the plaintiff, on the findings of the jury) dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s action. The action was to recover from the defendant railway company damages for injuries received by the plaintiff when, while walking on the defendant\u2019s railway track in the course of his duties as section foreman in the defendant\u2019s employ, he was struck by a train of defendant. The material facts and circumstances of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgments now reported, and are indicated in the above headnote. This Court ordered a new trial (Cannon and Crocket JJ. dissenting, who would restore the judgment at trial in plaintiff\u2019s favour).\nP. M. Anderson K.C. for the appellant.\nW. N. Tilley K.C. and H. A. V. Green for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Duff C.J. and Davis J. was delivered by\nDavis J.\u2014This is an appeal by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan which set aside the judgment at the trial, on the verdict of a jury, in favour of the plaintiff for $8,850, in an action against a railway company for damages for the loss of a foot. The plaintiff had been in the employment of the defendant company from September, 1919, first as a section man and since 1920 as a section foreman. At the time of the accident his section was from Weyburn, Sask., easterly a distance of 6.8 miles. On February 10, 1933, at about eleven o\u2019clock in the morning, while walking westerly between the rails of the single track in his section in the course of his duty of inspection, the plaintiff was struck by the engine of a special freight train of the defandant travelling in the same direction which overtook him. As he jumped from the track the engine hit his right foot and it was so badly injured that it had to be amputated. The railway company admits that the plaintiff was at the time lawfully and properly where he was in the course of his employment and that he is excluded from the benefits of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation (Accident Fund) Act, being chapter 253 of the Revised Statutes of Saskatchewan.\nIt was a cold, stormy day about forty degrees below zero, with a gusty wind blowing from the north-west to the south-east. It was a blizzard, the plaintiff says, and it was blowing in his face as he travelled westward. He was wearing a leather cap with ear-laps, and, though his face and nose were frozen, he says the ear-laps were hanging down loose. The plaintiff further says that he could not see very far and he knew that he might expect a train along at any time. The place of the accident was approximately 750 feet east from a level highway crossing, and the whistle post was approximately a quarter of a mile east from the crossing. There was a statutory duty upon the railway (sec. 308 of the Dominion Railway Act) to sound the whistle at least eighty rods before reaching a highway crossing at rail level and to ring the bell continuously from the time of the sounding of the whistle until the engine has crossed the highway, and penalties are imposed (sec. 419) for disobedience. There were also rules of the railway company (Nos. 9 and 17) that the headlight on the engine (being a night signal) must be used when weather or other conditions obscure day signals. It may be convenient here to mention that the doctrine of common employment is negatived by statute in the Province of Saskatchewan. R.S.C. (1930) ch. 49, sec. 27 (14).\nCounsel for the railway admitted that it was not proved that the whistle was blown or the bell rung at the particular whistle post. The engineer swore that the day was so stormy that he could not tell exactly where the different whistle posts along the line were but that the whistle was blown and the bell rung frequently that morning, though without reference to any particular whistle post. As to the headlight of the engine, the evidence is that it was turned off an hour or two before the accident because the glass was all covered with ice and snow and the storm was raging to such an extent that the train men regarded the headlight as useless. We have, however, the frank admission on behalf of the railway company that the company failed to prove that the whistle was blown or that the bell rang at the whistle post as required by the statute and it was admitted that the headlight on the engine was not burning as required by the company\u2019s rules. What the effect in law is of such admissions of fact is the real question with which we are concerned in this appeal.\nThe plaintiff charged the railway company with several acts of negligence or breach of duty. One of these was \u201cexcessive, reckless and dangerous speed (i.e., of the train) under the circumstances.\u201d The jury made no mention of this ground of complaint and the plaintiff\u2019s counsel before us did not contend that there was in fact any excessive speed but took the very opposite view of the evidence, to serve a particular purpose in his argument, that the speed of the train was moderate. Further, the plaintiff alleged as a ground of negligence that \u201cthe engineer and fireman failed to keep a sharp lookout and see the plaintiff and stop the train in time.\u201d The jury made no mention of any such alleged negligence and the evidence does not support any such allegation. The other grounds of complaint were the failure to sound the whistle and to ring the bell and to have the headlight burning.\nThe questions submitted to the jury and their answers were as follows:\n1. Was there negligence of the defendant company which caused the accident?\u2014A. Yes.\n2. If so, in what, did such negligence consist?\u2014A. No sounding of whistle, no bell ringing, no light in headlight of engine.\n3. Was there negligence of the plaintiff which contributed to the accident?\u2014A. No.\n4. If so, in what did such contributory negligence consist?\u2014A. No.\n5. Did the plaintiff with a full knowledge and appreciation of the risk arising from the circumstances nevertheless voluntarily elect to assume the same?\u2014A. No.\n6. In what amount do you assess the damages, if any?\nA. (a) General damages ......................... $8,500 00\n(b) Special damages .............................. 350 00 $8,850 00\nThe failure to sound the whistle and to ring the bell was put to the jury by the learned trial judge in his charge as a matter of absolute statutory duty. Dealing with sec. 308 of the Railway Act, which reads as follows:\nWhen any train is approaching a highway crossing at rail level the engine whistle shall be sounded at least eighty rods before reaching such crossing, and the bell shall be rung continuously from the time of the sounding of the whistle until the engine has crossed such highway,\nthe trail judge said,\nIt is my duty to say that this provision, sec. 308 of the Railway Act, is an absolute provision which has to be carried out, no matter what the weather conditions might be.\nI conceive it is my duty to charge you that the failure to comply with that provision in this case is absolute negligence in law, and that you are not free to find anything else with respect to it.\nWhile no objection was taken by counsel for the railway company to this part of the charge, the plaintiff has had and taken the full benefit of it. In my view it was a plain misdirection to the jury on a question of law. The statutory provision was designed for the protection of persons on, or about to proceed on, a highway crossing at rail level. The provision was not intended for the protection of persons walking along the tracks mile after mile without any reference to highway crossings, and the plaintiff upon the facts of this case was not entitled as a matter of law to the benefit of the statutory provision. The same question was considered by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1929 in the case of Chesapeake & Ohio Railway Co. v. Mihas[2]. The Court there quoted with approval a judgment in 1859 of the Supreme Court of Rhode Island, O\u2019Donnell v. The Providence and Worcester Railroad Co.[3], where it was held that a statute giving a right of action to one injured by the neglect of the railroad company to ring the locomotive bell before making a highway crossing was designed exclusively for the benefit of persons crossing the highway, and one injured while walking along the track not at a crossing could not recover under the statute. The court had there said (p. 214 of 6 R.I.),\nIf the defendants have violated any duty owing from them to the plaintiff, and by means or in consequence of that violation the plaintiff has suffered injury, he has a right to compensation and damages at the hands of the defendants for such injury. In the language of the books, an action lies against him who neglects to do that which by law he ought to do, (1 Vent. 265; 1 Salk. 335) and that, whether the duty be one existing at common law, or be one imposed by statute. In order, however, to a recovery, it is not sufficient that some duty or obligation should have been neglected by the defendants, but it must have been a neglect of some duty or obligation to him who claims damages for the neglect. In 1 Comyns\u2019s Digest, Action upon Statute, F, it is said, \u201cIn every case where a statute enacts or prohibits a thing for the benefit of a person, he shall have a remedy upon the same statute for the thing enacted for his advantage, or for the recompense of the wrong done to him contrary to said law,\u201d confining the remedy to such things as are enacted for the benefit of the person suing.\nThese American cases, while not differing in principle, are closer to the facts of this case than the English decisions in Gorris v. Scott[4], and Atkinson v. Newcastle & Gateshead Waterworks Co.[5].\nCounsel for the appellant relied upon the judgment of this Court in Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Anderson[6]. In that case the real question was whether or not the deceased passenger had been a trespasser or an invitee or licensee upon the railway tracks. The Court held upon the facts of that case that the deceased, who was not an employee of the railway company, could not be said to have been upon the railway tracks by the invitation or licence of the railway company at the time he was killed, and that the action of the deceased\u2019s administrator under Lord Campbell\u2019s Act did not lie. That is all that the case decided. Counsel for the appellant further relied upon the judgment of this Court in McMullin v. The Nova Scotia Steel and Coal Co.[7], but the point of that case was very different from what we have in this case. In that case a provision of the Nova Scotia Railway Act provided that\nwhenever any train of cars is moving reversely in any city, town or village, * * * the company shall station on the last car in the train a person who shall warn persons standing on or crossing the track\nof its approach. McMullin, who was engaged at the time in keeping the railway track clear of snow, was killed by a train, consisting of an engine and coal car, which was moving reversely. No person was stationed on the last car to give warning of its approach, and, as the bell was encrusted with snow and ice, it could not be heard. It was held that the enactment was for the protection of servants of the company. The statute there said nothing whatever about highway crossings at rail level. The question we have to determine here did not arise in that case.\nLord Maugham (then Lord Justice Maugham) said very recently in Monk v. Warbey[8]:\nThe Court has to make up its mind whether the harm sought to be remedied by the statute is one of the kind which the statute was intended to prevent; in other words, it is not sufficient to say that harm has been caused to a person and to assert that the harm is due to a breach of the statute which has resulted in injury.\nUpon a fair construction of sec 308 of the Railway Act, a workman walking along the tracks without any reference to a level highway crossing is not a person whom the Legislature intended to protect. It was that kind of consideration which affected the Court in Groves v. Wimborne[9]. Section 419 of the Railway Act, which imposes penalties for failure to comply with the provisions of sec. 308, cannot be read so as to extend the scope of sec. 308 to cover persons to whom the section was never intended to apply. It is not that workmen of the railway company are excluded from the benefit of the section; it is that the section was never intended for the protection of persons (whether workmen or the public generally) who are walking along the tracks, mile after mile, without any reference to a level highway crossing.\nThe findings of the jury of negligence in respect of the failure to sound the whistle and to ring the bell were obviously based upon the admitted breach of the statutory provision and the misdirection of the learned trial judge that failure to comply with the provision is absolute negligence in law. For these reasons, the findings in respect of the failure to sound the whistle and to ring the bell cannot be upheld. This was also the unanimous view of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal.\nIt remains to consider the evidence with regard to the headlight. It was a rule of the railway company that a headlight be displayed to the front of every train by night (rule 17) and that, when weather or other conditions obscure day signals, night signals must be used in addition (rule 9). The learned trial judge put the question of the headlight to the jury as a matter for the jury to deal with on the meaning of the words in the company\u2019s rule book, and we may fairly attribute the finding of negligence of the jury in respect of the headlight to the disobedience of these rules by the railway company. The evidence as it stands upon the subject of the headlight is merely guesswork as to whether or not the accident would have been avoided had the headlight been burning at the time. I agree again with the unanimous view of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal that upon the evidence as it stands the finding of the jury of negligence in respect of the headlight cannot be maintained.\nBut on the question of whether or not, quite apart from the statute, there was any negligence on the part of the railway company that caused the accident, the trial of the case was very unsatisfactory. I would therefore direct a new trial.\nThere should be no costs of this appeal but the costs of the appeal to the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal and of the abortive trial shall be in the discretion of the Judge at the new trial. Lamont J\u2014This is an appeal by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan, which reversed a judgment of the trial judge in favour of the plaintiff based upon the verdict of the jury in a running down action.\nThe plaintiff was an employee of the railway company for thirteen years, first as section hand until 1920, and from that date until the 10th of February, 1933, as section foreman. The section of which the plaintiff had charge ran east from Weyburn, a distance of 6.8 miles, and his duty was to patrol that section daily each way, inspecting it for broken rails or any other possible cause of accident. When the weather was fine he used the hand-car, but in stormy weather this mode of transportation was forbidden and his instructions were to walk between the rails.\nOn the morning of February 10, 1933, the temperature stood at 40 degrees below zero. At eight o\u2019clock the plaintiff, after a visit to the railway station to inquire if there were any special instructions for him, and receiving none, proceeded to inspect his section, the eastern end of which he reached about ten o\u2019clock. Only one train had passed him as he went east\u2014a passenger train going in the same direction. He says that he heard the whistle of this train blow and the bell ring, and as it was coming behind him, he got off the track. At the east end of his patrol, he turned and started to walk back. It was then 10.10 a.m. At a few minutes after eleven o\u2019clock, at a point about two miles from the eastern end of his section, he was overtaken by a freight train belonging to the defendants\u2014a special train which was then one day behind its schedule time. This train was running from Arcola to Regina, and without any warning it struck the plaintiff and knocked him down at a point about 150 yards west of the whistle post, near mile post 57.\nThe first intimation the plaintiff had of the proximity of the train was a sound that caused him to jump sideways to get off the track. His jump, however, did not succeed in carrying him clear of the track. His right leg was caught by the train and crushed so badly that it had to be amputated between the foot and the knee. For this injury the plaintiff brought an action, contending that the damage was caused by negligence on the part of the defendant\u2019s servants.\nIt is admitted by the railway company that at the time of the accident the plaintiff was lawfully on the track in the execution of his duty, and it is contended on his behalf that he was entitled to have the provisions of sec. 308 of the Railway Act and the provisions of the train rules of the company complied with for his protection. Section 308 of the Railway Act (R.S.C. 1927, ch. 170) reads as follows:\nWhen any train is approaching a highway crossing at rail level the engine whistle shall be sounded at least eighty rods before reaching such crossing, and the bell shall be rung continuously from the time of the sounding of the whistle until the engine has crossed such highway.\nIn his opening to the jury at the trial, counsel for the plaintiff said:\u2014\nMr. Hessler contends the railway company was negligent in this way: that at the whistle post they did not blow the whistle and they did not ring the bell from the whistle post to the crossing, as they should have done, according to the rules which we will put in, and that the headlight of the engine was not burning.\nTrain Rule 9 reads:\u2014\nNight signals are to be displayed from sunset to sunrise. When weather or other conditions obscure day signals, night signals must be used in addition.\nUnder the heading \u201cAudible Signals,\u201d Rule 14 (L) provides that on approaching public road crossings at grade the engineer shall give two long and two short sounds with the whistle.\nRule 31 says:\u2014\nSignal 14 (L) must be sounded at least 80 rods (\u00bc mile) from every public road crossing at grade, and the engine bell be kept ringing until the crossing is passed.\nSignal 14 (L) must be sounded at every whistle post.\nUnder the heading of \u201cGeneral Notice,\u201d I find the following:\u2014\nObedience to the rules is essential to the safety of passengers and employees, and to the protection of property.\nThe rules, therefore, were promulgated for the protection of employees as well as for the protection of passengers and others using the railway crossing.\nThe jury answered the questions put to them as follows:\u2014\n(1) Was there negligence of the defendant company which caused the accident?\u2014A. Yes. 2. If so, in what did such negligence consist?\u2014A. No sounding of whistle, no bell ringing, no light in headlight of engine.\n(3) Was there negligence of the plaintiff which contributed to the accident?\u2014A. No.\n(4) If so, in what did such contributory negligence consist?\u2014A. No.\n(5) Did the plaintiff with a full knowledge and appreciation of the risk arising from the circumstances nevertheless voluntarily elect to assume the same?\u2014A. No.\n(6) In what amount do you assess the damages, if any?\nA. (a) General damages ............................. $8,500 00\n(b) Special damages ............................. 350 00\n$8,850 00\nIn his charge to the jury, the learned trial judge, in instructing the jurors with reference to the statutory enactment of sounding the whistle and ringing the bell, said:\u2014\nI conceive it my duty to say, with some diffidence, but it is my duty to say that this provision, sec. 308 of the Railway Act, is an absolute provision which has to be carried out, no matter what the weather conditions might be.\nI conceive it my duty to charge you that the failure to comply with that provision in this case is absolute negligence in law, and that you are not free to find anything else with respect to it.\nNo objection appears to have been taken by either counsel to this part of the charge, but, in my opinion, it is a misdirection on the part of the trial judge. There is no such absolute and cast iron rule of law. We do not know whether the finding of the jury, that there was no blowing of the whistle or ringing of the bell, was a finding induced by the misdirection in the judge\u2019s charge or whether it was a finding based on the evidence.\nIf this finding was induced by a misdirection in the judge\u2019s charge, different considerations would apply than if it were dealt with as a question of fact for the jury. It is essential that we know how the jury looked at this: whether as a matter of law, or as a question of fact.\nIt is clear from the evidence and admitted by the company that the whistle did not sound nor the bell ring at the whistle post near which the plaintiff was injured. Although the engineer did say that he sounded the whistle oftener than he was required to, he admits that he could not see the whistle posts or the mileage posts on account of the violence of the storm, so he adopted the practice of whistling wherever he thought a crossing or a whistle post should be, but he could not swear that he whistled at the whistle post 150 yards east of where the plaintiff was injured, and the plaintiff swore he had not whistled there.\nIt is admitted, also, that there was no light showing from the headlight of the engine; that it had been burning but was extinguished by the engineer before the train reached Stoughton, which is about twenty-five miles west of Arcola, and the evidence is that it was not again lighted. This evidence was accepted by the jury, who found that it was negligence contributing to the accident not to have a light burning in the headlight of the engine under the circumstances. It was one of the plaintiff\u2019s contentions that under the weather conditions then prevailing the servants of the company should have taken the additional precaution of having the headlight of the engine burning, because the high wind and the snow made it at times impossible to see more than fifteen feet ahead of the engine.\nIn the Court of Appeal, the judgment which the trial judge entered for the plaintiff, based upon the verdict of the jury, was reversed on the ground that, although section 308 of the Railway Act provides for the blowing of the whistle and the ringing of the bell when a train is approaching the highway crossing at level rail, the result of the decisions upon that and similar sections is that the statute was intended only for the benefit of persons coming upon the crossing and that others lawfully on the track in the proximity of the crossing were not entitled to the protection afforded by it, and that, as the train rules are practically to the same effect, the plaintiff cannot get any assistance from them; and the Court cited the cases of Gorris v. Scott[10]; Le Lievre v. Gould[11]; and Atkinson v. Newcastle & Gateshead Waterworks Co.[12]; as well as a number of American authorities.\nIt is admitted that in the United States it has been specifically held that statutory enactments, imposing a duty upon a railway company to blow the whistle and ring the bell when approaching public crossings at level rail, are only for the protection of those using or about to use the crossing, and do not impose any duty in respect of other persons, so that a failure to comply with such requirement is not evidence of negligence of which an employee injured when walking on the track can complain. (See Norfolk & Western Ry. Co. v. Gesswine[13]; Connelley v. Pennsylvania Ry. Co.[14]). I do not find that the English cases have gone so far.\nIn Gorris v. Scott[15] the statutory provision relied on was the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Act, under which the Privy Council made orders, which they were authorized to do, in reference to animals brought into Great Britain on board vessels. One order was that the space in the vessel occupied by these animals should be divided into pens of a certain size. By neglect to observe the precautions prescribed by these orders, a number of sheep, which were being brought into England by the defendant in one of his vessels, were washed overboard, which they would not have been had the orders been complied with. In an action brought for damages for their loss, it was held that the owner of the sheep could not recover damages for the omission to comply with the order, because the statute and the orders were not intended for the benefit of the owner of the sheep in this way. The object of the statute and orders was to prevent the Spread of contagious diseases among the sheep, but with no relation to the danger of loss at sea.\nIn Atkinson v. Newcastle & Gateshead Waterworks Co.[16], it was held that the mere fact that a breach of a public statutory duty had caused damage does not vest a right of action in the person suffering damage as against the person guilty of the breach. Whether the breach does or does not give a right of action must in each case depend upon the object of the legislation and language of the particular statute.\nIn Groves v. Wimborne[17], Vaughan Williams, L.J., says:\u2014\nWhere a statute provides for the performance by certain persons of a particular duty, and some one belonging to a class of persons for whose benefit and protection the statute imposes the duty is injured by failure to perform it, prima facie, and, if there be nothing\u2019 to the contrary, an action by the person so injured will lie against the person who has so failed to perform the duty. The above paragraph from the judgment of Vaughan Williams, L.J., in my opinion, lays down the principles applicable to the case at Bar.\nDid the statute or the train rules impose a duty upon the company to blow the whistle and ring the bell at every whistle post; and did the plaintiff belong to the class of persons for whose benefit and protection the rules were made? As between the plaintiff and the company, the rules are as effective as the statute and are evidence of what the railway company considered to be the exercise of due care. The rule is explicit that the whistle should be sounded at every whistle post, and there is nothing in the rules to the contrary, and, in my opinion, the plaintiff was one of the classes for whose benefit the rules were promulgated. He was an employee who was on the track in the performance of his duty. Not only was he on the track, but he was expressly directed to walk between the rails in stormy weather. He was aware of the existence of the rules, and knew that it was the duty of the train hands to comply with them, for the rule book expressly states: \u201cObedience to the rules is essential to the safety of passengers and employees.\u201d The rules were not complied with, and the plaintiff was injured through the failure of the company\u2019s servants to comply with them. Unless, therefore, the jury find that the failure to comply with the rules can be justified or excused, the plaintiff, in my opinion, has an individual right of action for the injury he received.\nIn view of the rules and the finding of the jury, it cannot be said that the risk of injury was a danger incident to the employment which the plaintiff had agreed to assume and did assume. I cannot see anything in the general scope of the rules nor the language in which they were embodied, that would justify a limitation of the application of the rules to those persons only who were crossing or approaching the crossing at level rail.\nWhere the statute or rules aim at the protection of a particular class, or at the attainment of a particular purpose, which in the ordinary course is calculated to benefit a particular individual or member of a class, an individual injured by a neglect of the obligation, either as one of that class, or by reason of being affected by the failure to attain that particular purpose, may have his remedy although a penalty is imposed by the statute.\nIt was argued that the evidence shows that the fierceness of the storm was such that what the defendants did was a reasonable precaution against accident. That was a matter wholly for the jury.\nThe plaintiff had heard both the whistle and the bell of the train that passed in the morning, and the view of the jury was that the engineer\u2019s failure to blow the whistle and ring the bell contributed to the accident by which the plaintiff was injured. It was for the jury to say, under all the circumstances, whether or not the plaintiff would have heard the whistle and the bell. Train rule requires that, when the weather or other conditions obscure the day signals, night signals are to be used in addition. Engineer Neazor testified that sometimes he could not see more than fifteen feet ahead of the train owing to the storm, and at other times he could see a considerable distance.\nIt was also for the jury to say if, under the circumstances, the plaintiff would have seen the light of the headlight had it been burning. I must confess, however, that the evidence leaves my mind in a state of doubt on this point, but I take the jury\u2019s finding to mean that they were satisfied that he would have seen it.\nAs it is impossible to tell whether the finding of the jury as to the sounding of the whistle and the ringing of the bell is a finding of fact on the evidence, or was induced on the misdirection of the trial judge, there should be a new trial.\nThe appeal will be allowed, but without costs. The costs of appeal to the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal and of the abortive trial, shall be in the discretion of the judge at the new trial.\nCannon J. (dissenting)\u2014After having the advantage of reading the opinions carefully prepared by my learned brethren Lamont, Crocket and Davis, I am rather inclined to say that section 308 protects the railway employees at or near a railway intersection with a highway as well as any other person, in view of section 419 (2) of the Railway Act which enacts clearly and without restriction to any particular class of persons that, The company shall also be liable for all damage sustained by any person by reason of any failure or neglect so to sound the whistle or ring the bell.\nI feel that the spirit of our Railway Act is better interpreted in the words of Davies J. in McMullin v. Nova Scotia Steel and Coal Co.[18], than in judgments of English or American courts in cases concerning the application of statutes which may be different from our own legislation. Besides, the action is based, not only on the statutory duty of the respondent, but also on common law negligence and default in obeying the rules of the company.\nThe train was a special or extra one and the respondent took the risk to run it under difficult circumstances which, it is claimed, prevented the engineer in charge of the locomotive to give the signals provided for by the book of rules of the company, and especially rules 9, 14 (L), 17 and 31, which read as follows:\n9. Night signals are to be displayed from sunset to sunrise. When weather or other conditions obscure day signals, night signals must be used in addition.\n14. Engine Whistle signals.\n* * *\n(L) Approaching public road crossings at grade and at whistle posts [two long and two short sounds].\n* * *\nA succession of short sounds of the whistle is an alarm for persons or animals on the track.\n17. A headlight will be displayed to the front of every train by night * * *\n31. Signal 14 (L) must be sounded at least 80 rods (\u00bc mile) from every public road crossing at grade, and the engine bell be kept ringing until the crossing is passed.\nSignal 14 (L) must be sounded at every whistle post.\nThe company agrees before us that the whistle was not sounded and the bell not rung at the whistle post. It is also common ground before this Court that the appellant would have heard the whistle if sounded within 80 rods from the public road crossing near which the accident happened. These two points were closed to the respondent, said Mr. Tilley.\nNow, the rules of the company respondent, in my opinion, are sufficient evidence of the proper care that should be taken in the running of their trains. The jury found that they were not complied with, that this negligence by omission caused the accident. I cannot substitute my opinion, on this question of fact, to their verdict based on sufficient evidence.\nBesides, the fact that the appellant was not told, contrary to custom, by the station agent that an extra train was coming on that morning, would aggravate the imprudence of the company in persisting to run this special freight train in such weather, when it was impossible for the engineer in charge, at times, with the window of the cab down and the front windows all frozen, to see through them.\nUnder such weather conditions, when the company could not comply with the statute and their own rules, it would have been better to desist from running that special freight train than to run the risk of injuring or killing the appellant who was admittedly rightly at his work inspecting the track. For train movements, Rule 97 says:\nExtra trains must not be run without train orders.\nand Rule 106:\nIn all eases of doubt or uncertainty the safe course must be taken, and no risks run.\nUnder those circumstances, I would allow the appeal and restore the judgment of the trial court with all costs against the respondent.\nCrocket J. (dissenting).\u2014I am of opinion, after a perusal of the entire record in this case, that there is sufficient evidence to warrant the jury\u2019s findings and that the plaintiff is entitled to hold the judgment which the learned trial Judge ordered thereon.\nThere seems to be no doubt that, had the locomotive engineer blown the engine whistle at the whistle post or rung the bell as he passed it, the plaintiff would not have been struck, as he was, at a point over 600 feet west of the whistle post and approximately 750 feet east of the level crossing, nor that the plaintiff\u2019s injury is directly attributable to the neglect of the engineer to blow the whistle or ring the bell as he approached or passed the whistle post.\nThe learned counsel for the defendant frankly admitted that the plaintiff was rightfully on the track in the course of his duty as section foreman and that the finding of the jury that the whistle was not blown or the bell rung between the whistle post and the point where the plaintiff was hit was one which upon the evidence could not well be disturbed. He argued, however, that, although the failure to blow the whistle or ring the bell as the train approached or passed the whistle post was a breach of s. 308 of the Railway Act and of Rule 31 of the Railway Company\u2019s own printed rules, the defendant owed no duty to the plaintiff to give the required signals at this point, because s. 308 was enacted by Parliament for the protection only of vehicles and persons proceeding along the public highway towards the railway crossing and not for the protection of the employees of the railway or anyone else proceeding along the track unless possibly at its intersection with the highway. He relied mainly on the principle affirmed in the English cases of Gorris v. Scott[19], Le Li\u00e8vre v. Gould[20] and Atkinson v. Newcastle & Gateshead Waterworks Co.[21], and the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in 1929 in Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. Co. v. Mihas[22], where that court quoted with approval a judgment in 1859 of the Supreme Court of Rhode Island in O\u2019Donnell v. The Providence & Worcester Railroad Co.[23]. This appears to be the principal ground upon which the Appeal Court of Saskatchewan reversed the trial judgment in the case at Bar\u2014this and the fact that in the Appeal Court\u2019s opinion the finding as to the headlight could not reasonably be supported by the evidence. Another more recent American decision was also relied upon before us, viz., Jacobson v. Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pacific Rd. Co.[24], where the plaintiff, a section foreman, sought to maintain an action for negligence against that railway company upon the ground that the engineer had not blown the whistle or rung the bell of the locomotive which struck him. There is no doubt that, in the American cases relied upon, the decisions of the United States courts proceeded upon the principle that the railway company owed no duty to its employees in respect of the sounding of train signals required by the public statutes in approaching public highway crossings, but none of the English cases cited go to any such length, and, so far as I can discover, none have ever done so. This Court, on the other hand, definitely, in my view, laid it down in Grand Trunk Ry. Co. v. Anderson[25], that the provision of the Railway Act, s. 256, as it then stood in 51 Vict. (Dom.), cap. 29, relating to the sounding of the whistle and the ringing of the bell, which in all material aspects is the same as s. 308 of the present Railway Act, was not to be read as being intended exclusively for the protection of vehicles or persons proceeding along the public highway, but that all persons rightfully upon the railway track were entitled to the benefit of that provision. In that case the action was brought, not by an employee of the railway, but by the administrator and administratrix under Lord Campbell\u2019s Act, of a passenger who had disembarked from a train at an improvised station, from which no safe and reasonable means of egress were provided to the public highway, and who was struck and killed by a train while walking along the right of way. The action was brought in the Supreme Court of Ontario and was dismissed by Meredith, C.J. The Divisional Court on appeal reversed the trial judgment and this decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. The Divisional Court (Armour, C.J., Falconbridge and Street, JJ.) held that the deceased was lawfully upon the railway and that all persons, whether travelling on a highway or not, were entitled to the benefit of the provisions of s. 256 of the Railway Act requiring warning by bell or whistle on approaching a highway, and that the neglect of this statutory provision was evidence of negligence. The Divisional Court therefore ordered that judgment should be entered for the plaintiffs for the sum of $3,000.\nWhile this Court, per Gwynne, Sedgewick and Girouard, JJ., allowed the appeal from the Appeal Court of Ontario (Taschereau and King, JJ., dissenting) the majority, as well as the dissenting Judges, distinctly affirmed the principle, enunciated by the Divisional Court, that all persons rightfully travelling upon the railway were entitled to the benefit of the provisions of s. 256 of the Railway Act. Sedgewick, J., who wrote the majority judgment, distinctly states:\u2014 It must be admitted for the purposes of this case that the provision of the Railway Act, section 256, relating to the sounding of the whistle and the ringing of the bell was not complied with, and that all persons rightfully upon the railway track as well as upon the highway crossing next to the coming train are entitled to the advantage of this provision, and the sole question to be determined in this case is whether or not the deceased Mackenzie at the time he was killed was lawfully walking upon the railway track. In other words whether he was a trespasser or a licensee or invitee of the defendant company.\nIt was solely upon the question as to whether the evidence shewed the deceased to be a trespasser or an invitee that the appeal was allowed. Taschereau, J., was not disposed to interfere with the judgments of the Divisional Court and the Court of Appeal. King, J., simply stated that he thought the judgment in the court below was free from error and that the appeal should be dismissed.\nLater in McMullin v. The Nova Scotia Steel & Coal Co.[26], this Court (Sir Charles Fitzpatrick, C.J., and Girouard, Davies and Duff, JJ.) held that s. 251 of the Nova Scotia Railway Act, enacting that,\nwhenever any train of cars is moving reversely in any city, town or village, * * * the company shall station on the last car in the train a person who shall warn persons standing on or crossing the track\nof its approach, was an enactment for the protection of servants of the company standing on or crossing the track as well as of other persons, and allowed the appeal from the Nova Scotia Supreme Court. I reproduce the following passages from the reasons given by Davies, J., with whom all the other Justices named, concurred:\u2014\nWith respect to the proper construction to be given to section 251, I am unable to agree with the contention that the section only applies to persons not railway servants, and, as to them only \u201cwhile standing on or crossing the track of the railway\u201d at a highway crossing.\nThere does not appear to me to be any justification arising either from the language of the section itself or from its position in the Act and its relation to its context which would justify the courts in importing such limitations into it. Nothing is said in the section with respect to a \u201chighway crossing.\u201d What is said is that \u201cpersons standing on or crossing the track of such railway\u201d within the limits of a town, city or village, shall be entitled, so far as trains moving reversely are concerned, to have a certain specified precaution and warning observed. It does seem to be an arbitrary and unreasonable construction to exclude workmen from the benefit of such a prudent and beneficial section as this. In fact, it would seem rather more necessary for the workman\u2019s protection than for that of the outside public. Business might occasionally, no doubt, take some of the general public on or across these railway tracks within cities, towns or villages, but, apart from public highways, the presence of any of the general public would be a rare occurrence on these tracks.\nOn the other hand, the duties of many of the workmen, trackmen, switchmen, etc., require them to be \u201con or crossing the track\u201d frequently, and it would seem reasonable to conclude that the section was enacted as much, if not more, for their benefit than for the benefit of the small section of the general public who would legally go \u201con or across the track.\u201d Of course, the section is not for the benefit of trespassers and they, I assume, not to be within it.\nThe section applies in terms to any and all parts of the company\u2019s track within the city or town, and I see as little reason for excluding from the section the grounds of the company itself within such city as the workmen of the company.\nThese judgments of our own Court I regard as conclusive against the respondent upon this question. Even if they were not, I should not be disposed, in the absence of any authority actually binding upon me, to assent to the proposition that an employee of a railway, who is rightfully walking along the railway track in the course of his duty, is not entitled to rely upon the neglect of the locomotive engineer to blow the engine whistle or ring the bell when approaching a highway crossing at rail level in accordance with the provisions of s. 308 of the Railway Act as negligence, if that negligence is the direct cause of injury to him. The railway surely owed a duty to its sectionmen to exercise reasonable care to avoid injury to them.\nThe evidence here shews clearly to my mind that the plaintiff, when he reached the whistle post, where he knew that the rules of the railway required the blowing of the whistle and the sounding of the bell, relied upon the engineer\u2019s compliance with those rules as his protection between the whistle post and the highway crossing. He had a right to assume that, if any train came along, two long and two short blasts of the whistle would be sounded on reaching this point, which it is idle to my mind to suggest, had they been sounded, might not have been heard by him.\nApart from the failure to blow the whistle and ring the bell in pursuance of the statute and the Railway Company\u2019s printed rules, the jury found that there was negligence on the part of the defendant also in not using the headlight in the weather conditions which prevailed at the time. They no doubt meant that, had the headlight been on, as it ought to have been, it also would have warned the plaintiff in time to enable him to avoid his injury. That, it seems to me, was a finding upon a straight question of fact, depending in a very large measure upon the credibility of the testimony of the trainmen that the storm had caused such an accumulation of snow and ice on the glass of the headlight as to render it entirely useless as a train signal, and that for this reason they had turned it off. The jury were surely not bound to accept this evidence of the engineer and fireman at its full face value, simply because it was not specifically contradicted. The jurors had a right to test its credibility by the light of their own experience and knowledge. They may have regarded it as altogether improbable and inconsistent in itself or as inconsistent with indisputable facts or the testimony of the plaintiff and his witnesses, which they believed. As a mater of fact, there was undisputed testimony that another train running over the same track in the opposite direction two hours before used its headlight as a signal. Moreover, it is a matter of common knowledge that railway engine headlights are very powerful and can be seen, where the track is straight, as it was here, for miles in clear weather and that they cast their rays for long distances along the track, so as to serve as a warning of an approaching train, not only to persons walking towards it, but to persons going the other way. With all respect, it seems to me that it was entirely a question for the jury to determine, whether in the weather conditions, as they found them to exist, it was probable or improbable that such a powerful headlight was so obscured by the accumulation of snow and ice on its clear glass front that its reflection would not extend for more than ten feet along the track and consequently to render it completely useless. I should myself rather be disposed to think that, if the weather conditions were such as to make it impossible for the engineer or fireman to see any of the whistle posts along the track or to know whether they were approaching a level highway crossing or not, it was little short of foolhardiness to deliberately turn off the headlight as useless and continue to run the train along a section where the trainmen must have known there were highway crossings at rail level with the likelihood that sectionmen were going along the track in the discharge of their duty.\nIt was contended that engine headlights are not such signals as fall within the intendment of the railway rule No. 9. There may be some force in the argument, but it is clear from the evidence nevertheless that when weather conditions were such as to obscure day signals the engine headlights were in fact used as additional warning signals. Whether the rule itself required their use or not, the question was whether in the existing circumstances it was negligence to turn off the headlight on the engine, which caused the plaintiff\u2019s injury. In my view, it is a matter of no consequence that the trial Judge erroneously left, as it is contended he did, the interpretation of railway rules, Nos. 9 and 17, to the jury, instead of directing the jury himself as to their meaning.\nIt was objected also that the learned trial Judge misdirected the jury as to the effect of s. 308 of the Railway Act, and particularly in telling them that they were not free to find anything else than absolute negligence with respect to the engineer\u2019s failure to blow the whistle at the whistle post and ring the bell as thereby required. I think this objection is met by Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Anderson[27], and the very clear directions of the learned trial Judge to the jury that, before the railway could properly be held to be liable for the plaintiff\u2019s injury by reason of the breach of the statutory requirement, they must be satisfied that it was the direct consequence of such negligence. In view of the admission that the jury\u2019s finding as regards the failure to blow the whistle at the whistle post and ring the bell in approaching the highway crossing, as required by the statute, could not be disturbed upon the evidence, and there being no doubt that such failure does constitute negligence, if it directly causes injury or damage to any person rightfully on the track, as it is admitted the plaintiff was, the defendant cannot very well be held to have been prejudiced or any substantial wrong or miscarriage occasioned by the alleged misdirection.\nAs to the point that the action must be treated as founded entirely on the statutory breach of duty, the record, in my opinion, plainly shews that the plaintiff throughout was relying on common law negligence as well as the breach of the particular statutory duty. I think, for the reasons stated, that this appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the trial court restored with costs throughout.\nNew trial ordered.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Anderson, McDaniel & Alexander.\nSolicitor for the respondent: O.

Sedgewick K.C. contra.\nRINFRET J.\u2014Upon their trial before His Honour Judge Boles, sitting in the County Court Judge\u2019s Criminal Court of the county of Wentworth, the appellants were found guilty of having unlawfully, after the presentation of a bankruptcy petition against them, condoned and participated in the making and presenting of a false statement to the creditors of Minden\u2019s Ltd. for the purpose of obtaining the consent of the creditors or any of them to an agreement accepting fifteen cents on the dollar in full of the debt of Minden\u2019s Limited, and of having thereby committed an offence contrary to ss. 191 (p) and 201 of the Bankruptcy Act.\nThe Court of Appeal of Ontario confirmed the conviction.\nThe appellants now apply for leave to appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal on the ground that the judgment conflicts with that of the Supreme Court of Canada in the case of Electric Motor and Machinery Company, Limited v. The Bank of Montreal[1].\nTo understand the situation, it is necessary to state only a few facts.\nMinden, after the presentation of the bankruptcy petition, on the 16th December, 1932, attempted to make an arrangement with the creditors and to obtain a composition from them. To persuade them to accept his offer, he caused to be prepared a statement of assets and liabilities. Both courts found that the statement so prepared to form the basis of the negotiations was fraudulent and falsely represented the true assets, altogether omitting, as it did, a large block of goods which he pretended not to regard as seasonable stock.\nThe statement was made on the 20th December, 1932. The actual adjudication in bankruptcy did not take place until the 27th December.\nOne of the questions which the Court of Appeal had to decide was whether a false and fraudulent statement made between the date of presentation of the petition in bankruptcy and the date of the adjudication in bankruptcy may be held an offence under subsection (p) of section 191 of the Bankruptcy Act.\nThe Court of Appeal referred to subsection 11 of section 4 of the Act, which reads as follows:\u2014\n11. The bankruptcy of a debtor shall be deemed to have relation back to and to commence at the time of the presentation of the petition on which a receiving order is made against him. And the Court ruled that the effect of that statutory provision was to make the bankruptcy begin at the time of the presentation of the petition for all purposes.\nAccordingly the decision was that the accused must be found to have made the false and fraudulent statement after having been adjudged bankrupt, and contrary to subsection (p) of section 191. And the appeal was dismissed.\nIn the case of Electric Motor & Machinery Company, Limited v. The Bank of Montreal[2], the Court had to construe subsections (q) and (r) of section 191 of the Bankruptcy Act. The debtor had made an authorized assignment on the 3rd November, 1930. Subsequently, through its trustee, it submitted for approval to the bankruptcy court a proposal for a compromise. The demand of approval was contested by the Bank of Montreal. The bankruptcy court found as a fact that in and during the years 1927, 1928 and 1929, the authorized assignor had knowingly made to the bank three false statements of the character described in subsections (q) and (r); that these were offences under the subsections mentioned, and that\nthis being established, the court, under art. 16, parag. 2, of the Bankruptcy Act, was bound to refuse the approval of the proposal of compromise.\nIn the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Quebec), that judgment was upheld by the majority of the court (L\u00e9tourneau and Saint-Germain JJ. dissenting).\nUpon appeal to this Court, it was held that the acts dealt with in subsections (q) and (r) of section 191 are in terms the acts of a person\nwho has been adjudged bankrupt, or in respect of whose estate a receiving order has been made, or who has made an authorized assignment,\nand that, upon the plain meaning of the words, the offences described in the subsections in question had reference to the acts of a person who had already been adjudged bankrupt, etc. Therefore, the acts complained of, committed prior to the bankruptcy, were not criminal acts within the contemplation of subsections (q) and (r) of section 191.\nOn the present application it was urged on behalf of the appellants that subsection (p) is couched in language similar to that of subsections (q) and (r), and that, therefore, the judgment sought to be appealed from is in conflict with the judgment of this Court in the Electric Motor case2. The application is made under section 1025 of the Criminal Code. The appellants must show that\nthe judgment appealed from conflicts with the judgment of any other court of appeal in a like case.\nSection 1012 of the Criminal Code defines the interpretation to be given to the words \u201ccourt of appeal\u201d in part 19 dealing with Procedure by Indictment. Those words mean\nthe court designated by paragraph (7) of section two of this Act as the court of appeal for the province in which the conviction was had.\nIf we refer to paragraph (7) of section two, we find that it enumerates the courts of appeal of final resort in each of the nine provinces of Canada and in the Yukon Territory. The Supreme Court of Canada is not mentioned in the enumeration.\nNotwithstanding this, I think the Supreme Court of Canada is among the courts contemplated in section 1025 of the Act under the words: \u201cany other court of appeal\u201d; and I think it has always been so regarded, both in the discussion and in the judgments upon applications for leave similar to the present one (See: Hill v. The King)[3], although perhaps the point was not expressly decided.\nThe object of the section being to insure uniformity of interpretation and of application of the criminal law throughout the Dominion, it stands to reason that a conflict between the judgment of a provincial court of appeal and that of the Supreme Court of Canada must necessarily have been one which Parliament had in view when it enacted the section. The Supreme Court of Canada is a court to which, by force of the Criminal Code, an appeal may be brought in certain cases involving criminal matters; and, in that respect, it satisfies the language of section 1025: \u201cany other court of appeal.\u201d\nTherefore, I consider that it was open to the appellants to base their application upon an alleged conflict between the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Ontario in the present case and the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada in the Electric Motor case[4].\nBut when it comes to the next point raised by counsel representing the Attorney-General of Ontario, the appellants do not fare so well. In Electric Motor & Machinery Company Limited v. The Bank of Montreal4, the sub- ject-matter of the case was not criminal law. As appears by the short statement of the facts made at the beginning of this judgment, the Electric Motor case4 was about the approval of a proposal for a compromise. It was only indirectly and as an incident to the main question that the court was called upon to construe subsections (q) and (r) of section 191 of the Bankruptcy Act. It was not done for the purpose of deciding whether the debtor had to be convicted of the criminal offence covered by the section, but only with the view of adjudicating upon the application for approval of the compromise. Obviously this was not a criminal proceeding.\nUnder these circumstances, I am of opinion that the judgment in the Electric Motor case[5] does not meet the condition required in section 1025 that it should be \u201cthe judgment of any other court of appeal in a like case.\u201d\nRepeating again that the purpose of the section is to render as uniform as possible the administration of the law in criminal matters, The King v. Janousky[6]; Arcadi v. The King[7], my view is that, when Parliament used the expression \u201cany other court of appeal in a like case,\u201d it must be taken to have referred to a court of appeal adjudicating in criminal proceedings or upon criminal matters. Section 1025 is in the Criminal Code; and general language of that kind must be presumed to refer to the subject-matter of the statute where the section is to be found.\nFor those reasons, I hold that the judgment of this court in Electric Motor & Machinery Co. v. The Bank of Montreal5 is not a judgment of another court of appeal in a like case with that of the judgment sought to be appealed from.\nI may say further that, even assuming the other points in favour of the appellants, I do not understand the judgment of the Court of Appeal to be in conflict with the judgment of this Court in the Electric Motor case5. The latter judgment, as already stated, decided that, in order to be offences under subss. (q) and (r) of s. 191, the acts must have been committed by the debtor after he has been adjudged bankrupt. In the present case, the Court of Appeal also expresses the same view in respect to another subsec- tion of section 191, to wit: subsection (p). Then, however, Middleton, J.A., delivering the written judgment of the Court of Appeal, points out:\nThe Supreme Court of Canada, in its judgment, did not attempt to discriminate between the date of the presentation of the bankruptcy petition and the date when the person was adjudicated bankrupt, nor was the effect of section 4 (11) considered and that decision cannot be regarded as having any direct bearing upon the present case.\nIn the Electric Motor case[8], that point did not come up, for the false statements complained of had been made and submitted to the creditors long before the date of the presentation of the petition, in fact, several months before and at a time when it might even have been a question whether the debtor was then insolvent. The neat point which the Court of Appeal had to decide in the present case was not present in the other case. So that the two judgments did not turn on the same question.\nThe application for leave to appeal will, therefore, be dismissed.\nMotion dismissed.\n[1] [1933] S.C.R. 634.\n[2] [1933] S.C.R. 634.\n[3] [1928] S.C.R. 156.\n[4] [1933] S.C.R. 634.\n[5] [1933] S.C.R. 634.\n[6] [1922] 63 S.C.R. 223, at 225.\n[7] [1932] S.C.R. 158, at 160.\n[8] [1933] S.C.R. 634.\n",

APPEALS from two judgments of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1] dismissing two informations of the Attorney-General for Canada claiming from the Montreal Stock Exchange the sum of $3,431.16 and from the Exchange Printing Company the sum of $2,295.76 being sales tax under the Special War Revenue Act in respect of certain printed matter produced and sold by the two respondents.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nF. P. Varcoe K.C. for the appellant.\nL. A. Forsyth K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nKerwin J.\u2014The neat point for determination in these appeals is whether the sheets published by the respondents fall within the meaning of the word \u201cnewspapers\u201d as used in Schedule III of the Special War Revenue Act. While the appellant seeks judgment for certain amounts for sales tax in various years, the provisions of the Act applicable may be taken to be sections 85, 86 and 89 of R.S.C., 1927, c. 179.\nSection 85 (\u0192) provides that in part XIII of the Act \u201cproducer or manufacturer\u201d shall include \u201cany printer, publisher, lithographer or engraver.\u201d By section 86, a consumption or sales tax is imposed on the sale price of all goods (a) produced or manufactured in Canada payable by the producer or manufacturer. Subsection 1 of section 89 is as follows:\u2014\nThe tax imposed by this Part shall not apply to the sale or importation of the articles mentioned in Schedule III of this Act.\nSchedule III referred to, includes\nnewspapers and quarterly-monthly, by-monthly and semi-monthly magazines and weekly literary papers unbound.\nFor some years the Montreal Stock Exchange and later the Exchange Printing Company printed, about noon of each day that the Exchange was in session, a sheet showing the transactions on the Exchange during the morning, and in the afternoon a similar record of the transactions for the remainder of the day. In like manner were published the transactions on the Montreal Curb market. Each week was printed a \u201ccomparative review of transactions\u201d on the Exchange and a \u201ccomparative review of transactions\u201d on the Curb.\nThese sheets from time to time contained notices of dividends, annual meetings and the loss of certificates, in connection with companies whose stock was listed on the Exchange. The weekly publications besides summaries of the week\u2019s business, contained a tabulation comparing the business of that particular week with the business of the corresponding week in the previous year.\nThe members of the Exchange formed the greater bulk of the users of these sheets for which they paid on a sliding scale but copies were also exchanged with similar institutions in Canada and the United States. Some were sold to outsiders and the result of the evidence of the acting secretary-treasurer of the Exchange is that any member of the public might become a subscriber.\nThe term \u201cnewspapers\u201d is not defined in the Act and while we were referred to various definitions in other Dominion and provincial statutes, the statement of the present Chief Justice, in delivering the judgment of the Court in Milne-Bingham Printing Co. Limited v. The King (1) is peculiarly appropriate.\nThe usage of that word in other statutes may be looked at, if the other statute happens to be in pari materia, but it is altogether a fallacy to suppose that because two statutes are in pari materia, a definition in one can be bodily transferred to the other. * * *\nIn the instant case, the word under discussion is not defined in any statute in pari materia and it remains only to give to it the ordinary meaning that it usually bears. Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary may be taken as giving a definition of \u201cnewspaper\u201d which is expressed in corresponding terms in other well recognized dictionaries:\u2014\na paper printed and distributed at stated intervals * * * to convey news * * * and other matters of public interest.\nThe sheets in question meet these requirements; the mere fact that any particular publication is meant to interest only a section of the public does not limit the meaning of the expression as a reference to religious or fraternal publications will at once make clear. The sheets in question contain not merely a record of transactions on the Exchange or curb market but also information to those desiring it as to such transactions; and the other items from time to time included give \u201ctidings, new information, fresh events reported,\u201d (vide Concise Oxford Dictionary defining \u201cnews\u201d).\nBeing of opinion that the publications are newspapers for the purposes of the Special War Revenue Act, the respondents have brought themselves within the language of an exempting proviso. Dominion Press Limited v. Minister of Customs and Excise (1).\nThe appeals will, therefore, be dismissed with costs.\nAppeals dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W. Stuart Edwards.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Brown, Montgomery & McMichael.\n[1] [1935] Ex. C.R. 237.\n",

The law contemplates a clear duty on the part of the owner of a ship to enforce the observance of the obligation to take all necessary and reasonable precautions in order to prevent a grain cargo from shifting. In the present case, the appellant has failed to show it had taken any means to enforce the observance of the law in that respect. It did not attempt to exculpate itself, except in claiming that it had discharged its duty by supplying a ship properly equipped and appointing a certificated master. According to the evidence, the responsible officials of the appellant company did not apply themselves to the point of precautions at all and, before this Court, they took the stand that the question of loading the ship was one exclusively for the master and one with which they were not concerned. The trial judge found that no instructions were ever given by the company with regard to stowage of grain; and such acts of omission are included in the words \u201cactual fault or privity.\u201d\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, Quebec Admiralty District, P. Demers, L. J. A., refusing the appellant, as owner of the ss. Sarniadoc, the right to limit its liability under the provisions of section 503 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, and condemning the appellant to pay the costs of such action in limitation of liability. The appellant was the owner of the ss. Sarniadoc. At Port Colborne, Ont., on the 28th day of November, 1929, the Sarniadoc was loaded with two parcels of grain, the first consisting of 5,091 bushels of barley and 56,594 bushels of wheat, the property of The Canadian Co-operative Wheat Producers Limited, and the second of 37,391 bushels of wheat, the property of Jas. Richardson & Sons Limited. The latter parcel was insured by the Universal Insurance Company. After loading this cargo the Sarniadoc proceeded on its voyage to Montreal and on the night of the 29th November, 1929, stranded on Main Duck Island at the eastern end of Lake Ontario where it became a constructive total loss and its cargo was severely damaged. Subsequently two actions were instituted against Paterson Steamships Limited, as owners of the Sarniadoc. The first by The Canadian Co-operative Wheat Producers Limited for $83,029.03 and the second by Universal Insurance Company, as insurers of Jas. Richardson & Co. Ltd., for $60,573.42. The Canadian Co-operative Wheat Producers\u2019 action was heard in the Superior Court for the district of Montreal and judgment was rendered against Paterson Steamships Limited for an amount of $76,911.44. This judgment was appealed to the Court of King\u2019s Bench for the province of Quebec where it was confirmed and a further appeal was taken to the Privy Council where the judgments of the courts below were affirmed. The Universal Insurance Company action was stayed pending the outcome of the first action. Shortly after the judgment of the Privy Council, Paterson Steamships Ltd., the present appellant, took action in the Exchequer Court of Canada, Quebec Admiralty District, and asked for limitation of its liability under the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894. This action was directed against the companies-plaintiffs in the original damage actions and all others interested in the loss of the Sarniadoc. The present appellant asked that its total liability in respect of loss and damage arising from the stranding of its vessel the ss. Sarniadoc be limited under section 503 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, to an amount not exceeding \u00a38 sterling for each ton of the vessel\u2019s net registered tonnage with the addition of engine room space deducted for the purpose of ascertaining that tonnage.\nV. Lynch-Staunton and F. Wilkinson for the appellant.\nC. Russell McKenzie K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRinfret, J\u2014This is an action in limitation of liability.\nOn or about the 28th day of November, 1929, a cargo of wheat and barley was loaded aboard the ss. Sarniadoc belonging to the appellant company, at Port Colborne, province of Ontario, for shipment to the port of Montreal.\nOn the 30th day of November, at or near Main Duck Island, in Lake Ontario, the vessel struck and stranded stern on. She became, to all intents and purposes, a total wreck, being abandoned by her crew thirty-six hours after she struck. As a result of the stranding and wreck, the cargo of wheat and barley was damaged; and the respondents, the Canadian Co-operative Wheat Producers Ltd., and Universal Insurance Company respectively, brought actions in the Superior Court, in Montreal, for the purpose of recovering the damage sustained by each of them in the amount of $83,029.03 for the Co-operative Wheat Producers and $60,573.42 for the insurance company.\nThe Co-operative Wheat Producers\u2019 case proceeded before Mr. Justice Demers, in the Superior Court of Montreal, while the insurance company\u2019s case was allowed to stand pending a decision in the former action.\nJudgment was delivered in the Co-operative Producers\u2019 case, on the 31st day of May, 1932, condemning the appellant to pay to the latter the sum of $76,911.44, with interest since the 14th day of January, 1931, and costs. Mr. Justice Demers found that the appellant\nfailed to prove that it had made due diligence to make the ship in all respects seaworthy; that the grain cargo had not been properly secured from shifting by boards or otherwise; that the master could not properly navigate his ship by fear of shifting of the cargo; and that it is the principal reason of the stranding of the ship.\nUpon appeal, the judgment was confirmed by the Court of King\u2019s Bench of the province of Quebec, and subsequently by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.\nIn view of the fact that the Judicial Committee substantially approved the findings of the Superior Court, it is important carefully to consider the reasons of judgment of Mr. Justice Demers. He quoted section 6 of the Water Carriage of Goods Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 207), which reads as follows:\nIf the owner of any ship transporting merchandise or property from any port in Canada exercises due diligence to make the ship in all respects seaworthy and properly manned, equipped and supplied, neither the ship nor the owner, agent or charterer shall become or be held responsible for loss or damage resulting from faults or errors in navigation or in the management of the ship, or from latent defect.\nHe further quoted section 7 of the same Act, which reads as follows:\nThe ship, the owner, charterer, agent or master shall not be held liable for loss arising from fire, dangers of the sea or other navigable waters, acts of God or public enemies, or inherent defect, quality or vice of the thing carried, or from insufficiency of package, or seizure under legal process, or for loss resulting from any act or omission of the shipper or owner of the goods, his agent or representative, or from saving or attempting to save life or property at sea or from any deviation in rendering such service, or other reasonable deviation, or from strikes, or for loss arising without their actual fault or privity or without the fault or neglect of their agents, servants or employees.\nMr. Justice Demers then pointed out that a ship may be unseaworthy, or unsafe, not only by reason of defective condition of the hull, equipment or machinery, or by reason of undermanning; but also by reason of overloading or improper loading (Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, ss. 457 and 459). He referred to section 452 of the Act, which is to the effect that\n(1) Where a grain cargo is laden on board any British ship all necessary and reasonable precautions (whether mentioned in this Part of this Act or not) shall be taken in order to prevent the grain cargo from shifting.\n(2) If those precautions have not been taken in the case of any British ship, the master of the ship and any agent of the owner who was charged with the loading of the ship or the sending of her to sea, shall each be liable to a fine not exceeding three hundred pounds, and the owner of the ship shall also be liable to the same fine, unless he shows that he took all reasonable means to enforce the observance of this section, and was not privy to the breach thereof.\nHe stated expressly that the \u201cnecessary and reasonable precautions\u201d prescribed in section 452 were not taken in this case.\nHe then referred to section 696 of the Canada Shipping Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 186) under which ships registered in Canada and trading on the lakes are obliged to secure their grain cargo \u201cfrom shifting by boards or otherwise\u201d; and, after alluding to the practice which he held to have been proven\nthat since many years there are no shifting boards on the boats carrying cargoes on the lakes,\nhe declared that\nno usage should prevail against the law. Moreover, no general negligence of a duty is a good answer.\nHe dismissed the plea based upon the ground of \u201cperils of the sea\u201d; and he wound up his reasons by concluding that the ship\n\u2014no precaution having been taken to prevent the shifting of the cargo\u2014was not safe for the voyage and, therefore, was unseaworthy; that she was driven on the rocks on account of bad navigation; and that she was not properly navigated because of improper loading. In the judgment of the Privy Council, these findings were summarized as being\n(1) that the ship was unseaworthy in that the grain cargo was loaded in bulk and without shifting boards or other precautions to keep it from shifting, and that the owners had not exercised due diligence to make her seaworthy, and (2) that this unseaworthiness was the cause of the loss.\nTheir Lordships remark that the\n\u201cnecessary and reasonable precaution to be taken in order to prevent a grain cargo from shifting\u201d can \u201conly be determined as an issue of fact.\u201d\nThey referred to\nthe practice alleged by the appellant to prevail in the Canadian Lakes grain trade to do nothing but level off the grain in the hold,\nand they said that obviously the question whether such practice prevailed was also a question of fact. In their Lordships\u2019 opinion, it was\nclear that the ship was, according to the findings of the courts below, not merely unseaworthy but unseaworthy in such a way as necessarily to involve some fault or failure within the final words of section 7 of the Water Carriage of Goods Act,\nthat is: a fault or neglect of the owners of the ship or of their responsible servants or agents. Hence the appellants, Paterson SS. Ltd. could not\navail themselves of the exception of the dangers of the seas, though these dangers caused the loss, because they cannot show that in respect of the unseaworthiness which was also a cause of the loss, and indeed the real cause of the loss, that it existed under conditions entitling them to the benefit of the general words of exception at the end of the section (section 7 just referred to).\nIt was under those conditions and after the judgment of the Privy Council had confirmed in all material respects the judgment of the Superior Court condemning them to pay to The Canadian Co-operative Wheat Producers Limited the sum of $76,911.44, with interest and costs, that the appellant brought before the local judge in admiralty for the Quebec admiralty district the present action in limitation of its liability as owner of the steamship Sarniadoc. The object of the action was to obtain an order staying all proceedings in each of the actions instituted before the Superior Court for the district of Montreal, respectively by the Canadian Co-operative Wheat Producers Limited and the Universal Insurance Company, and to secure a decree that the total liability of Paterson Steamships Limited for the loss and damage resulting from the stranding of the Sarniadoc is limited to an amount not exceeding $69,897.84, this being the aggregate amount of $38.92 (\u00a38) for each ton of the registered tonnage of the ship with the addition of any engine room space deducted for the purpose of ascertaining the tonnage. The amount was tendered into court, together with interest thereon from the date of the stranding, and the further sum of $5,165.66 representing the taxable costs upon the actions hereinbefore described.\nThe action is based on section 503 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, the material parts, of which, as they form the main ground of the appellant\u2019s argument, may as well be quoted immediately:\n503. The owners of a ship, British or foreign, shall not, where all or any of the following occurrences take place without their actual fault or privity; (that is to say)\n* * *\n(b) Where any damage or loss is caused to any goods, merchandise, or other things whatsoever on board the ship;\n* * *\nbe liable to damages beyond the following amounts; (that is to say,)\n* * *\n(ii) in respect of loss of, or damage to, vessels, goods, merchandise, or other things, whether there be in addition loss of life or personal injury or not, an aggregate amount not exceeding eight pounds for each ton of their ship\u2019s tonnage.\n(2) For the purposes of this section\u2014\n(a) The tonnage of a steam ship shall be her registered tonnage with the addition of any engine room space deducted for the purpose of ascertaining that tonnage.\nThe appellants alleged that the stranding of the Sarniadoc occurred \u201cwithout their actual fault or privity,\u201d and, therefore, asked that their total liability to damage in respect of the loss be limited to the amount tendered in court; that all further proceedings in the actions of the respondents before the Superior Court of Montreal be stayed; that all other persons having claims arising out of the said loss or damage be restrained from instituting any proceeding against the appellants or against the ss. Sarniadoc and that the fund deposited in the Admiralty Court be distributed ratably among the several claimants, including the respondents.\nThe action thus brought by the appellants, Paterson Steamships Limited, was dismissed by the local judge in Admiralty, who happened to be the same Mr. Justice Demers who had already adjudicated, while sitting in the Superior Court, upon the action of The Canadian Co-operative Wheat Producers Limited, where his judgment was confirmed by the Privy Council. This is an appeal from the above judgment.\nFor the purpose of our decision, we are willing to assume that the local judge in admiralty had the power to issue an order staying proceedings instituted in the Superior Court, which is the court of general jurisdiction in the province of Quebec (ref. sec. 504 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894), even if the order is meant to prevent the execution of a judgment of the Privy Council condemning the owner to the payment of a fixed and liquidated sum of money\u2014as in the present case. As no objection seemed to be forthcoming from the respondents\u2019 counsel on these points, we are content in merely mentioning that they have not escaped our attention. In view of the result to which we have come, it is not necessary to pass upon them. It is sufficient to say that we will proceed to decide the case without considering these points.\nThe appellant submitted that the learned trial judge erred in finding that the action was based on section 903 of the Canada Shipping Act, instead of section 503 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, but we must confess our inability to find wherein, in the premises, any advantage would accrue to the appellant from the application of the section of one Act rather than of the section of the other Act. In so far as the present case is concerned, we fail to see any essential difference. Under both, the ship is the limit of liability, provided the damage or loss was caused without the actual fault or privity of the owner.\nIn the present case, we have not to speculate as to the cause of the loss or damage. It has been finally determined by the judgment of the Privy Council. The cause was the unseaworthiness of the ship owing to the bad stowage of the cargo of grain. And the Judicial Committee pointed out that, on its face, this must have involved the fault or neglect of the owners, or of their responsible servants or agents.\nIt remains to be decided\u2014which was not necessary in the first action but is essential in the present case\u2014whether the fault or neglect can be brought home to the owners, or if it was only that of their servants or agents; for, upon their true construction, the words \u201cwithout their actual fault or privity,\u201d in sections 503 of the Merchant Shipping Act or 903 of the Canada Shipping Act must exclude the doctrine \u201crespondeat superior.\u201d The fault or neglect of their agents, servants, or employees, was sufficient to disentitle the appellants from the benefit of the exception at the end of section 7 of the Water Carriage of Goods Act, c. 207, R.S.C. 1927:\nThe ship, the owner * * * shall not be liable for loss arising * * * without their fault or privity or without the fault or neglect of their agents,, servants or employees.\nSuch fault or neglect however is not sufficient to disentitle the appellants from the benefit of the sections relating to the limitation of liability. The owners can claim the limitation provided the damage or loss was caused without their own actual fault or privity. In the case of a corporation such as the appellant, the fault or privity must be that of (in the words of Viscount Haldane L.C. in Lennard\u2019s Carrying Company Limited v. Asiatic Petroleum Company Limited[1]).\nsomebody for whom the company is liable because his action is the very action of the company itself.\nBut it should not be forgotten that, in proceedings under sections 503 of the Merchant Shipping Act or 903 of the Canada Shipping Act, the owner is claiming a limitation of his liability; and it is for him to show affirmatively that the damage or loss happened without his actual fault or privity. It is for him so to speak, to exculpate himself (as distinguished from his servants or employees) from the responsibility for the loss or damage in repect of which he claims the limitation. The onus is upon him to show that there was no fault or privity of his own. He must bring himself within the exception (Lennard\u2019s Carrying Company Limited v. Asiatic Petroleum Company Limited1; Corporation of the Royal Exchange Assurance of London v. Kingsley Navigation Company Limited[2]).\nIn the case now under consideration, the Sarniadoc was not equipped with shifting boards; and it is clear that if the use of these boards was the only means of preventing the cargo from shifting, the failure to supply the boards would have involved the direct responsibility of the owner. Supplementary evidence made before the local judge in admiralty was directed to prove, however, that the cargo could have been loaded without any danger of shifting notwithstanding the absence of the shifting boards. This allegedly safe method of loading without the boards was not the method adopted by the master of the Sarniadoc, nor the practice followed by him on this or on previous occasions\u2014a practice sufficiently established in the evidence, referred to both by the Superior Court and the Privy Council in their judgments in the first action and held to have been bad and defective, indeed to have made the ship unseaworthy and to have been \u201cthe real cause of the loss.\u201d\nNow, it is the well defined duty of the owner to exercise due diligence to make his ship in all respects seaworthy (Sec. 6 of c. 207 of R.S.C. 1927). A ship is not seaworthy, we repeat, if she is improperly loaded; and, as prescribed by sec. 452 of the Merchant Shipping Act (N.B.\u2014Sec. 707 of the Canada Shipping Act contains similar dispositions)\nWhere a grain cargo is laden on board any British ship, all necessary and reasonable precautions (whether mentioned in this Part of the Act or not) shall be taken in order to prevent the grain cargo from shifting;\nand if these precautions have not been taken, not only the master of the ship and any agent of the owner who was charged with the loading of the ship or the sending of her to sea is liable to a fine, but the owner of the ship is also liable in the same fine\nunless he shows that he took all reasonable means to enforce the observance of this (prescription) and was not privy to the breach thereof.\nThe law, therefore, contemplates a clear duty on the part of the owner to enforce the observance of the obligation to take all necessary and reasonable precautions in order to prevent a grain cargo from shifting.\nIn the present case, the appellant, owner of the Sarniadoc, has utterly failed to show it had taken any means to enforce the observance of the law in that respect. It did not attempt to exculpate itself, except in claiming that it had discharged its duty by supplying a ship properly equipped and appointing a certificated master.\nWe are unable to agree with that view of the owners\u2019 duty under the Shipping Acts. The words \u201cactual fault or privity\u201d includes acts of omission (Royal Exchange Assurance v. Kingsley[3]). The fact is that the responsible officials of the appellant company did not apply themselves to the point of precautions at all. Even before this Court, they took the stand that the question of loading the ship was one exclusively for the master and one with which they were not concerned. The trial judge found that no instructions were ever given by the company with regard to stowage of grain and that, in that respect, the company had been disregarding the law for years,\ntheir practice consisting only in levelling off the grain in the hold, a practice which was known, or should have been known and not tolerated by the company.\nWe think these findings were supported by the evidence. The appellant could not relieve itself of its responsibility by claiming ignorance of the practice. It had means of knowledge which it ought to have used. In this case, the most that can be said is (to paraphrase the words of Lord Parmoor) that it did not avail itself of these means of knowledge. Its omission so to do was a fault, and, if so, \u201cit is an actual fault, and it cannot claim the protection of the section\u201d (Corporation of the Royal Exchange v. Kingsley Navigation Company3).\nWe think the trial judge rightly held that the appellant had not succeeded in bringing itself within the exception essentially required to obtain from the courts a limitation of its liability for the loss which occurred as a result of the stranding of the Sarniadoc on the 30th November, 1929. In our view the appellant has utterly failed to discharge the onus cast upon it of proving that the loss happened without its actual fault or privity.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Weldon & Lynch-Staunton.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Brown, Montgomery & McMichael.\n[1] [1915] A.C. 705, at 713.\n1 [1915] A.C. 705, at 713.\n[2] [1923] A.C. 235.\n[3] [1923] A.C. 235, at 245.\n3 [1923] A.C. 235, at 245.\n",

Limited and Another (Defendants) Appellants;\nand\nAugust Wills (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1935: February 8, 11; 1935: March 18.\nPresent: Duff C.J. and Lamont, Cannon and Davis JJ. and Dysart J. ad hoc.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nMotor vehicle\u2014Collision\u2014Damages\u2014Intersection of streets\u2014Right of way\u2014Liability\u2014Statute\u2014Interpretation\u2014The Highway Act, B.C., 1930, c. 24, s. 21.\nThe respondent, who was driving his car north on Blenheim street in Vancouver, on reaching 14th avenue, looked to his right and saw the appellant's truck about 100 feet away from the intersection and coming towards it. He proceeded to cross the intersection and when nearing the opposite side the rear of his car was struck by the appellant's truck. The driver of the truck testified that he looked to his left, the direction from which the respondent approached the intersection, at a point about 50 feet east of Blenheim street, and did not see the respondent's car. He then looked to his right and did not look again to his left until he had proceeded some distance in the intersection. He then saw the respondent's car at a point just inside the intersection limit and he immediately put on his brakes. The trial judge dismissed the action, but the majority of the Court of Appeal allowed the respondent damages for an amount of $5,663.40. Section 21 of The Highway Act, B.C., 1930, c. 24, provides that \" the person in charge of a vehicle so drawn or propelled upon a highway shall have the right of way over the person in charge of another vehicle approaching from the left upon an intercommunicating highway and shall give the right of way to the person in charge of another vehicle approaching from the right upon an intercommunicating highway; but the provisions of this section shall not excuse any person from the exercise of proper care at all times.\"\nHeld that, upon the evidence, the respondent's action should be dismissed. There is no ambiguity or obscurity in the language of section 21 of The Highway Act; the driver approaching an intercommunicating highway is bound to keep a lookout for drivers approaching upon the right upon that highway and to make way for them, and, in doing so, a collision is not only improbable, but hardly possible. The respondent in this case failed in this duty and such neglect of duty was the direct cause of the collision.\nPer Duff C.J.\u2014The plain and unmistakeable words of a statute should not be glossed by paraphrases based upon surmises or suppositions as to the purpose of the legislature.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal (49 B.C.R. 140) rev. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] , reversing the judgment of the trial judge, Fisher J., and maintaining the respondent's action for $5,663.40 damages.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nC. W. Craig K.C. for the appellant.\nE. F. Newcombe K.C. for the respondent.\nDUFF C.J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Cannon.\nThe statute we have to apply is in these words:\n21. The person in charge of a vehicle so drawn or propelled upon a highway shall have the right of way over the person in charge of another vehicle approaching from the left upon an intercommunicating highway, and shall give the right of way to the person in charge of another vehicle approaching from the right upon an intercommunicating highway; but the provisions of this section shall not excuse any person from the exercise of proper care at all times. (The Highway Act, Stats. of B.C., 1930, ch. 24).\nI can perceive no ambiguity or obscurity in this language. The driver approaching an intercommunicating highway is to keep a lookout for drivers approaching upon the right upon that highway and to make way for them. If everybody does this a collision is not only improbable, it is hardly possible. The respondent failed in this plain duty. This neglect of duty was the direct cause of the collision. The learned trial judge has, in effect, so found the facts. There is not the slightest ground for disagreeing with him.\nI must add, I feel, that to gloss the plain and unmistakeable words of a statute, by paraphrases based upon surmises or suppositions as to the purpose of the legislature, is, in my humble view, a rash procedure.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the trial judge restored with costs throughout.\nThe judgment of Lamont, Cannon, Davis JJ. and Dysart J. ad hoc was delivered by\nCANNON J.\u2014This appeal is submitted from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia which, by a majority, reversed the judgment on the trial of Fisher, J., by which plaintiff's action to recover damages in respect of injuries suffered as a result of a collision between two motor vehicles at a street intersection in Vancouver was dismissed. Macdonald, C.J.B.C., and McPhillips and McQuarrie, JJ.A., allowed the appeal and gave judgment for $5,663.40. Martin, J.A., and Macdonald, J.A., dissented, the first being of opinion that the accident was caused solely by the negligence of the plaintiff; and the second learned justice thought that both plaintiff and defendants were negligent and that the defendants' negligence contributed to the accident to the extent of 40%.\nThe collision occurred on the 2nd of January, 1934, at the intersection of 14th avenue west and Blenheim street, in the city of Vancouver, at about 12.30 o'clock in the afternoon. The respondent was driving a Nash coach northerly along Blenheim street. The defendant Hudson, in the employ of Swartz Bros. Ltd., was driving his truck westerly along 14th avenue.\nAccording to the plan, both streets are equal in measurements as between street boundary lines, as to width of sidewalk and boulevard allowance, and width of roadway. Each street is sixty-six feet wide between boundary lines. The portion thereof used for sidewalk and boulevard on each street is approximately 20 feet on each side of the roadway; the roadway of each street is 27 feet wide. There are no stop signs at or against either street at this intersection.\nAt the time of the collision, it was raining and the streets were wet. When the respondent, who was driving at a speed of about twenty miles per hour, reached a point approximately twenty feet from the southerly curb stone of 14th avenue west, he slowed down to an estimated speed of fifteen miles per hour and looked to his right, where he saw the motor truck of the appellants which, he says, was about 100 feet back from the easterly curb stone of Blenheim street and was not proceeding at a dangerous rate of speed. The plaintiff then looked to his left and then to his front, accelerated his speed to proceed across the intersection and was proceeding at the rate of approximately twenty miles an hour at the moment of the impact. The defendants' truck approached the intersection at a rate of speed of between 20 and 25 miles per hour. The driver Hudson says that he looked to his left, the direction from which the plaintiff approached the intersection, at a point about fifty feet east of Blenheim street and did not see the plaintiff's car. He then looked to his right, northerly, up Blenheim street. There were some bushes which partially obstructed his vision in that direction. Hudson did not look again to his left until he had proceeded some distance in the intersection and passed the east boundary of Blenheim street. He then saw the plaintiff's car on Blenheim street at a point just inside the intersection limit. He immediately put on his brakes; but it was too late to avoid the accident. The application of the brakes so reduced the speed as to lessen the force of the impact.\nAlthough the versions of the two eye witnesses of the accident differ in some respects, one must say, after a careful perusal of the evidence, that Hudson is a more satisfactory witness than Wills; and the learned trial judge seems to have accepted in the main the facts as recited by the driver of the truck and found that Hudson approached the intersection somewhat earlier than the plaintiff and that, on account of the difference in speed, both arrived at the intersection at the same time. Under those circumstances, it being admitted that there was no excessive speed on the part of the defendant Hudson, and the plaintiff approaching from his left, Hudson was entitled to the right of way. The learned trial judge found that the plaintiff did not keep a proper look out; that he should have seen the defendants' truck approaching and not have attempted to proceed across the intersection before it.\nSection 21 of The Highway Act, statutes of British Columbia, 1930, ch. 24, is as follows:\n21. The person in charge of a vehicle so drawn or propelled upon a highway shall have the right of way over the person in charge of another vehicle approaching from the left upon an intercommunicating highway, and shall give the right of way to the person in charge of another vehicle approaching from the right upon an intercommunicating highway; but the provisions of this section shall not excuse any person from the exercise of proper care at all times.\nBut it is urged that the plaintiff's motor car was struck on the side, at the rear, when six feet of the plaintiff's car was passed and clear of the path of the oncoming truck; that the position of the point of impact shows that plaintiff entered the intersection first and should have been allowed to proceed by the defendant Hudson.\nThe learned Chief Justice, on appeal, by comparing the distances between the different points shown on the map, on the basis that both parties were travelling at that time at the same rate of speed and continued to do so, found that Wills was about 20 feet within the intersection when Hudson reached the boundary line.\nThis, I believe, is erroneous, as the plaintiff admits that he increased his speed, while the defendant continued to travel at the same rate until he put on his brakes. It would, therefore, seem apparent that the plaintiff travelled a greater distance than the defendant after they entered the intersection, because they were not travelling at the same speed. As my brother Davis remarked during the argument, distances must be translated into time in order to determine what are the rights of the parties. During the argument, it was conceded that the differences in the measurements that were stressed before us, when translated into time, did not amount to more than a quarter of a second of time.\nThe clear fact emerging from the evidence is that plaintiff, although he had seen the truck approaching, disregarded the law giving to the defendant the right of way, speeded up his automobile and took a chance. Hudson, on the other hand, as soon as he saw the plaintiff, realized the danger at about 20 feet before the impact and put on his brakes. He had the right of way and was entitled to assume that plaintiff would follow the rule.\nLord Atkinson, in Toronto Railway v. King[2] , said:\n*** traffic in the streets would be impossible if the driver of each vehicle did not proceed more or less on the assumption that the drivers of all other vehicles will do what it is their duty to do, namely, observe the rules regulating the traffic of the streets.\nEspecially in a case where we have a clear cut statutory duty, it would take more than the unsatisfactory evidence of the plaintiff to set aside the rule and excuse his reckless action in crossing this intersection at an increased speed after he had seen the truck, by resorting to more or less reliable calculations of distances and of the respective speed of the two vehicles. From the time that he saw the defendants' truck, the plaintiff, after accelerating his speed and while crossing the intersection, paid no regard whatever to the defendants' truck, never looked at it again until he felt the force of the impact. If he had looked, he might have swerved to the left on that wide street and avoided the collision. He did nothing whatever to prevent the accident, although he says that he was travelling at such a rate that he could have stopped his car within fifteen feet just before entering the street, after he slowed down; and the only reason that he did not do so was that he did not see the defendants' truck which, he admits, he could have seen if he had looked again in that direction before starting to cross the intersection. He says:\nQ. Now, then, I ask you again, don't you think that you looked to the right before you ever got to within 20 feet of the curb line?\u2014A. I don't remember.\nQ. You don't remember. In any event, almost immediately after you looked to the right you accelerated your speed, didn't you?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Yes. Now as a matter of fact, when you looked to the right, didn't you see the truck so close that you just had to try to beat it across the intersection?\u2014A. No, it was far enough away that I thought I had time to cross.\nQ. I see. You didn't change your course at all before the collision, did you? You just carried on in a straight line?\u2014A. Yes, that is right.\n***\nQ. You did not sound your horn?\u2014A. No.\nQ. And you didn't apply your brakes before the collision?\u2014A. No.\nQ. In other words, you really didn't do anything at all to avoid the accident?\u2014A. Well, I thought I would get across.\nQ. You didn't do anything at all to avoid it, did you?\u2014A. No, I had sufficient time to cross.\nQ. Well, that is for his lordship to decide. I ask you just to answer yes or no. You didn't do anything at all to avoid this accident, did you?\u2014A. No.\nThe only remaining question is whether the defendant, although he had the right of way, exercised proper care. Having observed, when he was 50 feet away from the intersection that there was no traffic approaching from his left, Hudson thought it his duty to watch for traffic on his right, to which he had to yield the right of way. He was entitled to expect that a northerly bound driver on Blenheim street, who had now reached a point 50 feet from the intersection, would keep a proper lookout and observe the rule of the road laid down by section 21 of The Highway Act above quoted. The presence of the bush obstructing his view to the right was sufficient reason for him to look more carefully and with more insistence in that direction to detect any vehicle which might have approached from there.\nWhere there is nothing to obstruct the vision and there is a duty to look, it is negligence not to see what is clearly visible. The respondent in this case admits that he did not see the truck after he started to cross. It was then clearly visible; and, unfortunately for the plaintiff, we must reach the conclusion that his injuries resulted from his own negligence in taking a chance to cross the intersection ahead of the truck which clearly had the right of way.\nWe, therefore, would allow the appeal with costs and restore the judgment of the trial court with costs throughout for the appellant.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Craig & Tysoe.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W.

Sloan K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nLamont J.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, dated the 8th day of January, A.D. 1935, affirming the conviction of the appellants by His Honour Judge Lampman in the County Court Judges' Criminal Court, in and for the county of Victoria, on the charge that they did, on the 3d day of March, 1934, unlawfully assault Fong Chan Ten and did thereby occasion him actual bodily harm.\nThe appellants were tried and the conviction was recorded on June 29, 1934. They each filed a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia on several grounds.\nOn the hearing of the appeal the appellants moved the Court of Appeal for leave to admit the evidence of two witnesses, who were not called at the trial, and to set aside the conviction and order a new trial on the ground that even though the evidence adduced at the trial might have justified a finding of guilty, the evidence of these two new witnesses raised a doubt as to the appellants' guilt.\nThe motion to admit the new evidence was refused, on the 29th of October, 1934, by the Court of Appeal, McPhillips and M. A. MacDonald, JJ.A., dissenting. But the conviction was not affirmed until the 8th of January, 1935. The formal judgment of the court affirming the conviction, after properly reciting what had taken place, contains the following:\u2014\nAnd this Court having ordered, on the 29th October, 1934, that the motion to set aside the conviction and order a new trial on the ground of the discovery of the new evidence, be dismissed, *** and this Court having directed that this appeal do stand for judgment and upon the same coming on this day for judgment the Court doth order and adjudge that the appeal be and the same is hereby dismissed and the conviction affirmed. There was no dissenting judgment to the affirmance of the conviction, but the formal judgment contains this paragraph:\u2014\nThe Honourable Mr. Justice McPhillips and the Honourable M. A. MacDonald dissented from the judgment of this Court on the motion to set aside the conviction and order a new trial on the ground of the discovery of the new evidence.\nIt is upon these disenting judgments on the motion to admit new evidence that the appellants claim a right to appeal to this Court under section 1023 of the Criminal Code, which provides that any person convicted of any indictable offence, whose conviction has been affirmed by an appeal taken under section 1013, may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada against the affirmance of such conviction on any question of law on which there has been dissent in the Court of Appeal.\nWe are all of opinion that the dissent in the Court of Appeal on the motion for leave to introduce new evidence is not a dissent against the affirmance of the appellants' conviction on a question of law within the meaning of section 1023.\nThis Court has therefore no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal.

Nevertheless, we have had an opportunity of examining the evidence with care and we have come to the conclusion that it is not necessary to call on counsel for the respondent.\nWe agree with the view of the pleadings taken by the Appellate Division.\nAs regards the other matters, we do not think it necessary to say whether we do or do not concur with the view of Mr. Justice Tweedie that the publication of the libellous matter\u2014of the libellous communication\u2014to the customers of the meat market would, in the absence of proof of express malice, be protected as privileged communication. All that is necessary to say is that we are quite clear that the appellant has no ground to complain against the ruling of the trial judge on that point. Then, as to misdirection; first, in respect of privilege. There again we are quite satisfied that the appellant has no ground for complaint. In some respects it may be that matters were put to the jury rather more favourably to him than he was entitled to require.\nAs to express malice\u2014when the charge is read as a whole, we think the jury could have been under no misapprehension as to the meaning of the learned trial judge. We think he made it quite clear to them that they must be satisfied of the existence of express malice in order to escape the result of his ruling as to privilege.\nThere are some other matters of misdirection in respect to which it will be necessary to mention only two. One concerns the plea of justification. The complaint there is that the jury were not told that they might find upon that issue favourably to the appellant, upon circumstantial evidence alone. It is quite clear to us that if a direction of that kind was desired counsel ought to have asked for it.\nIn addition to that, no complaint was made in respect of any such misdirection in the notice of appeal. We have no doubt that, where one of the grounds of appeal is misdirection, under rule 323, the misdirection must be stated with reasonable definiteness in the notice of appeal. In these circumstances, we consider that particular ground is not open in this Court.\nThe other matter in respect of which misdirection is charged\u2014the only other matter requiring notice by us\u2014is what the learned trial judge said at the conclusion of his charge upon the failure of the defendant to establish his plea of justification as being something which the jury might take into consideration as matter in aggravation of damages. There again the learned judge's attention was not called to the inaccuracy of his language, and there, also, the matter now complained of is not mentioned in the notice of appeal. In the circumstances, that ground also is not open here.\nIn the result, we think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n",

The appellant\u2019s claim was that his disease (Bright\u2019s disease in chronic form) had been caused by his having absorbed gases in respondent\u2019s establishment in Shawinigan Falls, and he attributed it to a number of alleged defects in respondent\u2019s establishment, absence of or defect in ventilation, faulty handling of material, absence of masks or breathing apparatus, absence of instructions on the dangers, excessive heat, too long hours of work exceeding appellant\u2019s and other workmen\u2019s strength, exposure to cold after intense heat, bad quality of drinking water, use of metals causing undue danger. The appellant alleged that a great many other workmen who were employed in respondent\u2019s establishment became ill as a result of the conditions existing there and that he was suffering permanent incapacity. The respondent pleaded that, if the appellant was affected by any disease, it was not caused by any noxious substances emanating from the metals that he was handling or that were being treated in the company\u2019s workshops, but that his state of health was weak for a long time previous to his employment; that his illness was due to causes absolutely foreign to the work that he performed for the respondent or the things that the respondent had in its care; that many men employed by the respondent remained in its employ for a great many years without suffering any ill-effect, that its establishment was operated in accordance with the law respecting industrial establishments and the law respecting hygiene for the province of Quebec; that its process of manufacture was most modern; that its operations were carried on according to the rules of art and that its establishment was kept in healthy and sanitary conditions, considering the kind of production that has to be done by the respondent; that in the remelting department where the appellant worked there were no gases or metallic evaporation which could cause the illness of which he complained and that the working conditions in that department were normal; that previous to his employment by the respondent, the appellant was in a poor state of health; that he had been weak for many years and suffered from earache; that the disease (Bright\u2019s disease) affecting the appellant was not caused by his working conditions when employed with the respondent.\nThe appellant\u2019s action was dismissed by the trial judge, Marchand J., who delivered elaborate reasons for judgment dealing with all the facts of the case; and the judgment was unanimously affirmed by the appellate court.\nLouis A. Pouliot K.C. for the appellant.\nJ. A. Prud\u2019homme K.C. and L\u00e9on Girard for the respondent.\nOn the appeal to this Court, after hearing argument of counsel for the appellant, without calling upon the respondent\u2019s counsel, the Chief Justice delivered orally the judgment of the Court.\nDuff C.J.\u2014We think, Mr. Prud\u2019homme, it is unnecessary to call upon you. We have had some opportunity of looking into the appeal since it was opened yesterday afternoon and have had the advantage of a very exhaustive and able argument by Mr. Pouliot in which, we are quite satisfied, everything that reasonably could be said has been said in support of the appeal.\nThe appellant\u2019s case is put upon article 1054 C.G. as well as on article 1053 C.C. Mr. Pouliot, with frankness and candour, agrees that, in every respect of the case, the onus was upon the plaintiff (now the appellant) to establish causal relation between the faults of the respondents or the plant or something under the care of the respondents and the malady from which the appellant suffers and in respect of which he claims reparation.\nThe learned trial judge found, not only that the appellant had not acquitted himself of the onus upon him in respect of this issue, but he found that, in fact, the causal relation did not exist. The Court of King\u2019s Bench confirmed that finding by the declaration in its formal judgment that there was no error in the judgment of the Superior Court.\nIn this Court, in view of the concurrent findings of the courts below, we are not called upon to say what we should have done if one of us had been sitting in the place of the trial judge. We say nothing whatever about that. The onus was upon the appellant to establish that the courts below were clearly wrong in the manner in which they disposed of the issue, and, in order to do that, it is necessary that something should be pointed out that is definitely wrong in what they did. Our attention has not been called to any error of law, to any error with respect to the burden of proof, to any material misapprehension of the effect of the evidence, and we are satisfied that, on the whole, this is a case in which we could not properly interfere. The appeal will be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Louis A. Pouliot.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Bigu\u00e9, Gouin, Girard & Provencher.\n",

In September, 1930, the respondent was owner of those apartments and, as security for the loan of $150,000 made to him at that time he hypothecated the apartments in favour of Canada Permanent Mortgage Corporation. The sum of $150,000 was repayable in capital and interest, in equal monthly instalments of $1,300.50 each. A short time later, the apartments were sold by the respondent to the appellant for the sum of $27351.57 and the deed of sale provided that the purchaser would not be personally responsible for the amount of the hypothec. The appellant was in possession of the property for about a year, when financial difficulties intervened. He did not pay the monthly instalments due to the Mortgage Corporation for some months and allowed municipal taxes to accrue. Finally, he went into bankruptcy. The Mortgage Corporation pressed for payment; and the trustee and inspectors of appellant\u2019s bankrupt estate, unable to raise funds or secure a purchaser for the property, secured permission from the Court to sell the property under the formalities of the Bankruptcy Act and placed advertisements for its sale in the Quebec Official Gazette. The charges against the property at that time consisted of a balance of the loan then in excess of $140,000, the indemnity of 6 per cent due to the lender in case of a forced sale, the taxes due to the city of Montreal of approximately $10,000, the taxes to the Provincial Government of $4,000 and the fees and commission due to the solicitor for the bankrupt estate and the trustee. The trustee valued the property at $360,000, but, being of the opinion that the time was not opportune for a sale in view of the condition of the real estate market and fearing that any equity for the estate would be lost if a forced sale took place, he attempted to secure a delay from the Mortgage Corporation for a period of approximately one year, when he hoped that a more receptive market might be found. Following negotiations, an agreement was reached on March 4, 1932, whereby the Mortgage Corporation gave to the trustee an extension of approximately one year for repayment of the past due portion of the loan. This agreement was made possible by the intervention of respondent who would have been responsible for any deficiency between the sale price of the property and the charges thereon. By the agreement the respondent paid to the Mortgage Corporation the arrears of capital and interest on the loan and also paid the arrears of taxes, the fees and expenses of the trustee and solicitors and other incidental expenses. The conditions of the agreement were that the respondent should hold and administer the property until January 25, 1933, but that on that date, or any time prior thereto, the trustee of the appellant\u2019s bankrupt estate or his nominee would have the right to resume possession of the property and to keep title by repaying the respondent\u2019s disbursements and assuming payment of the debt to the Mortgage Corporation. If the trustee or his nominee failed to do this within the stipulated delay, the property was to be vested in the respondent. The arrangement of the 4th of March, 1932, was previously approved by the inspectors of the estate, and the trustee was authorized to sign the agreement by the registrar in bankruptcy. The appellant was made aware of the negotiations and was informed of the trustee\u2019s intention to enter into such agreement. Subsequently the appellant succeeded in having a proposal of composition accepted by his creditors and approved by the bankruptcy court. On the 31st of May, 1932, he secured his discharge, the receiving order was cancelled and the court further ordered that all of the appellant\u2019s assets, including any equities of redemption and the interest of the appellant in any property then vested in the trustee, should be returned to him. The trustee re-transferred to appellant his assets and included in the transfer the Lord Renfrew Apartments. On the 27th of July, 1932, and again on the 22nd of November, 1932, the appellant made attempts to comply with the conditions of the agreement of the 4th of March, 1932, and on the latter date the appellant\u2019s lawyers wrote to the respondent asking him to furnish them immediately a statement of all disbursements made by him. The respondent answered that he was forwarding such an account to a firm of lawyers who under the agreement had been constituted respondent\u2019s attorneys. On January 20, 1933, the appellant instituted a petitory action against the respondent, claiming back the apartments as owner, invoking no other title than the original deed of sale from the respondent to him, dated the 26th of November, 1930. The delay accorded to the trustee or his nominee to retake possession of the property upon repayment of the respondent\u2019s disbursements would have expired on the 25th day of January, 1933, or four days after the service of the action. Before the date fixed for the respondent\u2019s appearance, the time allowed for repossession of the property by the trustee or his nominee had expired.\nHeld that the appellant\u2019s action should be dismissed. The title deriving to the appellant from the deed of sale of the 26th of November, 1930, ceased to have any effect in his favour from the moment that, by force of the bankruptcy order, the Lord Renfrew Apartments became vested in the trustee; and, by the agreement of the 4th of March, 1932, the respondent became the absolute owner of the apartments, unless, under its terms, the trustee, or his nominee, rendered that agreement of no effect as regards the respondent by complying with the several conditions therein stipulated up to and including the 25th day of January, 1933, or unless the agreement so made between the trustee and the respondent can be set aside on the ground of fraud\u2019 (and no fraud had been alleged) or illegality. The trustee, or his nominee (the appellant) have never complied with the terms and conditions required to render the agreement of no effect.\nMoreover, the agreement of the 4th of March, 1932, was not illegal, as the trustee had the power, under section 43 of the Bankruptcy Act, with the permission in writing of the inspectors, to enter into such agreement. It was the trustee\u2019s duty to do everything in order to maintain for the estate any equity that it ought to have in the apartments and to preserve, as far as possible, the rights of the bankrupt estate in that property. The hypothecary claim against the appellant, or his trustee, and its consequential result under articles 2058 and 2061 of the Civil Code may well be regarded as a \u201cclaim out of, or incidental to, the property of the debtor made or capable of being made on the trustee by any person\u201d with respect to which the trustee is empowered by subsection (i) of section 43 of the Bankruptcy Act, with the permission in writing of the inspectors, to \u201cmake such compromise or other arrangement as may be thought expedient\u201d\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, reversing a judgment of the Superior Court, De Lorimier J. and dismissing appellant\u2019s petitory action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nT. Brosseau K.C. for the appellant.\nJ. L. O\u2019Brien for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRinfret J\u2014The appellant was adjudged bankrupt and a receiving order was made against him on the 24th day of December, 1931. One Frederick Henry Pope was in due course appointed trustee of the bankrupt estate.\nAmong the assets of the appellant which passed to and vested in the trustee was the apartment house known as \u201cLord Renfrew Apartments,\u201d together with the land on which it was erected.\nThe appellant had acquired the property in question through a deed of sale from the respondent, dated the 26th November, 1930, for the price of $27,851.57, and for the further consideration that he would pay all taxes and assessments imposed upon the property from the 1st day of September, 1930, as well as his proportion from said date of all taxes for the current year. It was declared in the deed\nthat said property is affected by a first hypothec of $150,000 in favour of Canada Permanent Mortgage Corporation, under the terms of the deed registered at said registry office under no. 256430, payment whereof is not assumed by the purchaser (Grimaldi). The hypothec so declared was the result of a deed of loan by Canada Permanent Mortgage Corporation to the respondent payable in 180 monthly instalments of $1,300.50 each on the twenty-fifth day of each month, during a term of fifteen years, the first of such instalments to be paid on the twenty-fifth day of September, 1930. The hypothec was to secure the reimbursement of the loan and of the instalments, together with any overdue interest. Among other conditions in the deed of loan, it was provided that, in case of default on the part of the borrower to pay the taxes on the property, or to pay the instalments in reimbursement of the loan, or to fulfill any of the conditions stipulated in the deed, the Mortgage Corporation could, if it chose,\nexact the amount \u00f3f the loan with all interests then accrued; and this without any demand or notice being necessary.\nFurther, the borrower was to pay all fees, legal and notarial, in respect of the loan and all registration fees.\nAt the date of the appellant\u2019s bankruptcy, default had been made in the payment of several instalments due to the mortgage corporation and also in the payment of taxes and assessments due to the city of Montreal in respect of the property on the 1st October, 1930, and on the 1st October, 1931. It follows that, then and there, Canada Permanent Mortgage Corporation had the right to exact the payment of the full amount of the loan and to bring against the appellant, or subsequently against the trustee of the bankrupt estate, an hypothecary action in enforcement of its claim, or, in default of payment thereof, to compel the surrender of the property, in order that it may be judicially sold.\nThe respondent was advised by the trustee and by the Mortgage Corporation that the property was threatened with sale. This appeared agreeable to him as the best way out of the situation. However, the trustee and the inspectors, for the estate represented to him that they could save the equity of the estate in the property if a judicial sale could be avoided and if he could give them some opportunity to find a purchaser. They had endeavoured to find one who would assume the property for the arrears of mortgage and arrears of taxes, but had been unable to do so, nor had they been able to borrow the money required. \u201cAfter a tremendous amount of negotiations,\u201d and as \u201cthe outcome of interviews proceeding perhaps for weeks or months,\u201d the respondent finally consented to take over the administration of the property upon the terms that he would immediately pay to the Mortgage Corporation the arrears of capital and interest owing under the deed of loan, and assume to the exoneration of the trustee all taxes affecting the property. He was also to discharge forthwith certain legal and notarial fees and disbursements, as well as the trustee\u2019s fee of $2,000.\nAs a consideration for these payments and the obligations thus assumed by him, the respondent was to receive $1,000 a year for the administration of the property; and a conditional sale was made to him, to take effect on the 25th of January, 1933, upon which date he would become absolute owner, provided the trustee, or his nominee, had not before then reimbursed to him all disbursements\non account of interest, taxes, capital, or for repairs or improvements of the property, or the general administration or maintenance thereof,\nincluding the legal and notarial charges paid by him, and in general all bona fide out of pocket expenses.\nThe agreement to the above effect was signed on the 4th March, 1932, between Canada Permanent Mortgage Corporation, the respondent Pierce and the trustee Pope. The document was duly registered on the 12th of May, 1932.\nMr. D. McKenzie Rowat, notary public of Montreal, representing the mortgage corporation, when giving evidence, summed up the situation as follows:\nMy opinion was that it was absolutely in good faith, and a concession by us in favour of Mr. Grimaldi, who had defaulted. We could have foreclosed the mortgage at once, but instead of doing that we gave him months, or a year or something of the kind, to redeem it. He owed us. We were collecting the rents. We had power under our mortgage to collect the rents in default of payment of interest. So we thought, and it was clearly understood by all the inspectors at a round table conference which lasted the whole day (at which the solicitor here present was representing some of the parties). There were three or four lawyers there, and myself, and two notaries, and we worked all day on it. It was admitted by everybody that we were making a concession saving Mr. Grimaldi by giving him until January 25, 1933\u2014nearly a year. We could have foreclosed, and cleaned him right out. He was insolvent, and we could have rushed the thing right through and wound it up, but we said: \u201cWe will give you nearly a year more to redeem.\u201d That was the sum and substance of the transaction, and everybody felt we were acting in good faith and in the common interest of everybody.\nAnd the trustee adds:\nAs I saw it, it seemed to me it would give the estate an opportunity of approximately one year in which to sell the property and to get an equity out of it for the benefit of the creditors.\nThe arrangement of the 4th March, 1932, was previously approved by the inspectors of the estate, two of whom were lawyers, one a banker, another a real estate operator, and the fifth one a very large creditor. The trustee was authorized to sign the agreement by the registrar in bankruptcy.\nThe appellant was made aware of the negotiations and was informed of the trustee\u2019s intention to enter into the agreement. He was told\nIt was a question of either signing that agreement or allowing the Canada Permanent Mortgage Corporation to go ahead and foreclose. There was no other alternative.\nHe made no objection to it. As a matter of fact, he was present at a meeting of the inspectors on March 8, 1932, and then stated\nthat if the assets were sold, the estate would realize nothing.\nOn March 11, 1932, in a general letter addressed to the creditors, the trustee stated as follows:\nAs to the assets we may say that the Lord Renfrew Apartments have been turned over to Mr. A. S. Pierce, in consideration of him paying the arrears of taxes, interest, etc., with the rights of redemption of the property to the estate within one year, which means if we can sell over and above the mortgage and moneys advanced the estate can repossess it immediately at the time of sale, otherwise at the expiration of one year, the ownership will be vested in Mr. Pierce.\nThe subsequent events were that the appellant Grimaldi succeeded in having a proposal of composition accepted by his creditors and approved by the bankruptcy court. On the 31st of May, 1932, he secured his discharge; the receiving order was annulled and it was ordered\nthat all the assets of the said debtor (Grimaldi), including any equities of redemption and the interest of the debtor in any property now vested in the said Fred. H. Pope, shall be vested in the debtor, his heirs and assigns.\nOn the 27th of July, 1932, and again on the 22nd of November, 1932, he made attempts to comply with the conditions of the agreement of the 4th of March; and, declaring that he was\ndesirous to exercise the rights confirmed to him through Pope by the above deed which shall expire on the 25th day of January, 1933, and retake possession of said property upon paying (the respondent Pierce) the above charges as mentioned in art. VII of said deed of agreement,\nhe wrote to the respondent asking him to furnish immediately a statement of all disbursements made by him\non account of interests, taxes, capital, or for repairs or improvements to the property, or the general administration or maintenance thereof, including any expenses whatsoever relating to the Lord Renfrew property, and including in particular the legal and notarial charges * * *, and in general all bona fide out of pocket expenses, and all the rentals which you may have collected during possession of the above property Lord Renfrew.\nThe appellant was told that Mr. Pierce had not yet been notified by the trustee that the latter had assigned his rights to anyone, or that the appellant had obtained his discharge, but that, at all events, the respondent was having an account prepared of all the amounts disbursed by him during his administration of the property and was forwarding this to a firm of lawyers who, under the agreement of the 4th March, 1932, had been constituted the irrevocable attorneys of the respondent. Nothing further appears to have been done by the appellant until, on the 20th day of January, 1933, he brought this action asking that, by the judgment to intervene, he be declared the owner of the Lord Renfrew Apartment, invoking no other title than the original deed of sale from the respondent to him, dated the 26th of November, 1930, and ignoring altogether the other events (including his bankruptcy) and the subsequent agreements which had taken place in the meantime. The judges of the Court of King\u2019s Bench unanimously dismissed the action of the appellant, on the ground that the respondent had legally become the owner of the Lord Renfrew Apartment through the agreement made between him, the Canada Permanent Mortgage Corporation and the trustee Pope, on the 4th day of March, 1932; and the appellant has failed to convince us that he was entitled to succeed in his appeal from that judgment.\nIt is quite evident that the title deriving to the appellant from the deed of sale of the 26th November, 1930, which is the sole title invoked by him in his petitory action, ceased to have any effect in his favour from the moment that, by force of the bankruptcy order, the Lord Renfrew Apartments became vested in the trustee. It is also evident that, by the agreement of the 4th of March, 1932, the respondent became the absolute owner of the Lord Renfrew Apartments, unless, under its terms, the trustee, or his nominee, \u201crendered that agreement of no effect\u201d as regards the respondent by complying with the several conditions therein stipulated \u201cup to and including the 25th day of January, 1935\u201d or unless the agreement so made between the trustee and the respondent can be set aside on the ground of fraud or illegality.\nThe trustee, or his nominee (the appellant), have never complied with the terms and conditions required to render the agreement of no effect.\nAlthough fraud was alleged, none was entertained either by the Superior Court or by the Court of King\u2019s Bench; and none was proven.\nAs for illegality, we are of opinion that the trustee had the power, under section 43 of the Bankruptcy Act, with the permission in writing of the inspectors, as was done in this case, to enter into the agreement in question.\nIt was the trustee\u2019s duty to do everything in order to maintain for the estate any equity that it might have in the Lord Renfrew Apartment and to preserve, as far as possible, the rights of the bankrupt estate in the said property.\nIt is true that the appellant had not assumed personally the payment of the loan of $150,000, to secure which the property was affected by a first hypothec. If the appellant, or the trustee, were willing to surrender the property, there would be no personal liability on their part; but as long as they wished to hold it and enjoy the revenue thereof, they had to make the payment of the instalments as they became due. The appellant was fully aware of this obligation on his part and, as a matter of fact, he had made the payments to the Mortgage Company up to the time when his insolvency prevented him from continuing.\nThe Canada Permanent Mortgage Corporation had against the appellant, or his trustee, an hypothecary action to enforce its claim. The appellant, and subsequently his trustee, held as proprietors the immoveable hypothecated for that claim (Art. 2058 C.C.) and The object of the hypothecary action is to have the holder of the immoveable condemned to surrender it in order that it may be judicially sold, unless he prefers to pay the debt in principal, interests as secured by registration, and costs. (Art. 2061 C.C.).\nThe claim against the appellant, or his trustee, and its consequential result under articles 2058 and 2061 of the Civil Code may well be regarded as a\nclaim arising out of, or incidental to, the property of the debtor, made or capable of being made on the trustee by any person.\nwith respect to which the trustee is empowered by subsection (i) of section 43 of the Bankruptcy Act, with the permission in writing of the inspectors, to\nmake such compromise or other arrangement as may be thought expedient.\nIn our view, the agreement of the 4th March, 1932, was such an arrangement.\nIn the premises, the trustee got the permission of the inspectors and the authorization of the registrar, as provided for by section 159 of the Bankruptcy Act and sections 4 and 5 of the Bankruptcy Rules. The attack, on the ground of illegality, made upon the deed of agreement of the 4th of March, 1932, therefore, fails, and the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nWe reach that conclusion quite independently of the argument made by the respondent that, under all the circumstances, the appellant fully acquiesced in the arrangement, and in such a manner as to preclude him from disputing the validity thereof\u2014an argument in regard to which the appellant was certainly unable to find a satisfactory answer.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Brosseau & Brosseau.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Audette & O\u2019Brien.\n",

When the child was about ten years old, the present action was tried to determine who was entitled to custody of him. The child had never been made a ward of the plaintiff. Kingstone J., and the Court of Appeal for Ontario (by a majority) held in favour of defendants. On appeal to this Court:\nHeld: (1) The appeal should be dismissed; under said Act the plaintiff had not a legal right to call upon the court ex debito justiti\u0153 to deliver to it the custody of the child; and this Court saw no reason to disagree with the views expressed in the Courts below that it was not in the child\u2019s interests to deprive defendants of custody of him.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] dismissing (Latchford C.J. dissenting) its appeal from the judgment of Kingstone J.\nBy an order made in the Supreme Court of Ontario by McEvoy J. on October 18, 1932, it was directed that an issue be tried to determine the party entitled to the custody of the infant in question.\nThe issue was tried before Kingstone J. who held that the defendants were entitled to the custody of the infant.\nThe plaintiff is a Society approved by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council as a Children\u2019s Aid Society under the provisions of the Children\u2019s Protection Act, R.S.O. 1927, c. 279, and amendments thereto. The defendants are husband and wife. The following paragraphs are taken from the judgment of Kingstone J. (delivered orally) in which he deals with the facts and questions to be considered.\nThis is an action arising from an issue directed by the Hon. Mr. Justice McEvoy as to the custody of a young boy of some ten years of age.\nIt appears that his mother, an unmarried woman, placed him in the plaintiff institution, known as St. Vincent de Paul Children\u2019s Aid Society, in Toronto some time in 1923. This is a Catholic society formed and existing under the statute, and has the care and custody of children.\nThe defendant, Mrs. Spence, who had just lost her own child\u2014her only child at that time\u2014was desirous of adopting a child, and went to see a priest who lived in the vicinity where she and her husband were farming, some time in February, 1923. The priest\u2014Father McReavy I think was the name\u2014wrote a letter to the plaintiff society on the 6th of February, 1923. The letter is directed to Mr. McCabe of the society, and states that the bearer of the letter, Mrs. Spence, wishes to adopt a baby, and further states,\u2014\n\u201cI spoke to you over the \u2019phone concerning this matter. So far as I know, I think that she would be kind and good to the child and would rear it a Catholic. I also met Mr. Spence and I was favourably impressed with him.\u201d\nNo doubt the society relied to a considerable extent on the information contained in the letter. The officials interviewed Mrs. Spence and consented to hand over this child. In my opinion the understanding between them at the time quite clearly was that the child was to be brought up by Mrs. Spence in the Catholic faith, and she undertook to do that.\nShe also expected\u2014and I think that was part of the understanding between them\u2014that in two years\u2019 time, or that in less than two years\u2019 time, she was to get adoption papers, all predicated on her bringing the child up in the Catholic faith.\nApparently according to the evidence some conversation took place as to her connection with the Catholic church, and I think she gave them to understand that she had been a member of that church, as she had been, for some four years. She did tell them, that her husband at the time was what she described as a staunch Presbyterian.\nShe took the custody of the child. The application form was filled out afterwards in typewriting, but taken from notes supplied by Mrs. Spence at the time of the application to the official, whose name at the moment I have forgotten, but I think it fairly accurately represents the information they had from Mrs. Spence as to the family relations. The husband, I see, is described as Non-Catholic and the wife as Catholic. The occupation is described as farming, and so on.\nMrs. Spence apparently stayed for some time in this farming district near Acton, Ontario, where she was at the time she got the child, and moved later on to Hamilton and Burlington. For some time she reported to the society, but when she moved to Burlington and to Hamilton she ceased to do so, and I think from then on lost all interest in bringing the child up in the Catholic faith, as she had represented she was going to do, and on which they relied.\nOfficers of the society visited her, or made efforts to get in touch with her, from time to time, and finally did see her in Burlington, and I think it was made pretty fairly clear to them then that she was not living up to the arrangement as they understood,\u2014in other words, that she was not giving the child, or indeed intending to give the child, the instruction in the Catholic faith that they thought was necessary. They then I think became alarmed as to the situation and desired to get the custody of the child back.\nAn agreement was entered into on the 21st of June, 1923. That agreement evidently was made prior to her going to Burlington, and was the agreement on which they relied for her carrying out the arrangement and understanding that was come to when she got possession of the child. This agreement provides,\u2014\n\u201cIt is also agreed that this child shall be instructed in the principles of the Roman Catholic faith, and sent to the Catholic Separate School if there be one in the district.\u201d\nThat was in June, 1923. As I say, that agreement was not observed, and in 1931, in the month of May, another agreement was made. This agreement is very vigorously attacked by Mrs. Spence\u2019s counsel, on the ground that it was obtained by undue influence and by threats and so on. I have not the slightest doubt that when this agreement was signed Mrs. Spence had formed a very strong attachment for this child, as she naturally would, and was unwilling to part with it, and that she did, perhaps very grudgingly finally sign the document, but I do not think that any duress or improper influence was exercised. She was paid the sum of $85 at the time she signed this document. It was not signed by her husband apparently. It provided that the plaintiff society should board the boy with the party of the second part, Mrs. Spence, for a period of twelve months. It also provided that the boy should be taken to the nearest separate school on all school days, and to the nearest Catholic church on all Sundays and holy days, and that she should provide the boy with a good and sound home life, and she was to be paid by the society for these services the sum of $20 per month. Each party was given the right to cancel this agreement.\nUp to this time the child had never been made a ward of the society under the Children\u2019s Protection Act, though an application had been made to Judge Mott. By reason of the fact that Mrs. Spence had moved out of the city of Toronto, the Judge held that he had no jurisdiction to deal with the application, and nothing further was done. As the child was not made a ward of the society no adoption papers were made out.\nThe result is that the society had, I think, the right to control the custody of this boy in the first instance, but having parted with the possession of the boy, the point arises whether they have the right to insist on re-possessing themselves of this child.\nThe child under a further agreement signed in June, 1932, was handed over by the Spences to the custody of this society, and they received the sum of $100. The society, having regained possession under the terms of this agreement, boarded the child out with a Mrs. Finnegan. Subsequently in September of the same year the child of its own volition came back to its foster parents on the 20th of September, 1932; and the foster parents then declined to deliver the child up, and these proceedings have resulted.\nThere is the question of the wardship which the society did not secure, but the most important point, and the ground on which I am going to decide this case, is, what is in the best interests of this child? The welfare and the happiness of the child, as has already been said in many cases, seems to be of paramount importance. Notwithstanding these agreements what the Court is asked to dispose of is the custody, control and possession of a human being and not a mere chattel. He has a right to live his life. The child is well cared for and is in apparently a congenial and happy home. The home surroundings, I am satisfied from all the evidence, are everything one could reasonably expect. The child is being brought up in another faith\u2014a faith different to that of its mother, and different to that of the society in which the mother placed it.\nBut is that to be considered of such importance that this child should be taken from the home and surroundings in which he has been brought up, handed back again to the society, and placed out with somebody else where the situation may be quite different?\nThe boy is now ten years of age. He has obviously formed an affection for his foster parents, and they for him. There are two other children there that have come since, and they all appear to be a very happy family.\nUnder the law as I understand it, it is my duty to consider, first of all, in a matter of this kind, what is in the best interest of the child. I have made up my mind that the proper thing for me to do, having regard to the child\u2019s future welfare, is to direct that the child remain under the custody and control of Mrs. Spence and her husband, and I give judgment accordingly.\nThe judgment at trial declared that the defendants were entitled to the care, custody and control of the infant; that the plaintiff was not entitled to the issue of a writ of Habeas Corpus in respect of the infant; that the moneys paid into court to the credit of the cause ($185 paid by the plaintiff to the defendant Mrs. Spence and brought into court with the defence for the purpose of having the same repaid to the plaintiff) be paid out to the plaintiff. The court made no order as to costs.\nThe Court of Appeal received and admitted as further evidence on the appeal certain affidavits and exhibits with regard to matters discovered by the plaintiff since the appeal was first heard.\nThe Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal with costs[2]. The plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nW.B. McHenry for the appellant.\nR.R. McMurtry for the respondents.\nAfter hearing argument of counsel, the Court delivered judgment orally, dismissing the appeal with costs.\nDUFF C.J.\u2014We do not think it necessary to reserve consideration of this appeal. In the first place, we are quite satisfied that under the Statute, the Children\u2019s Protection Act, which has been discussed, the appellant has not a legal right to call upon the court ex debito justiti\u0153 to deliver to it the custody of the child.\nThat disposes of the case, so far as the Statute is concerned.\nWe express no opinion upon the technical point passed upon by Mr. Justice Fisher\u2014as to whether the Society has any status to make an application. We merely say that under the Statute the Society has no right which the court is bound to recognize ex debito justiti\u0153 to have delivered to it the custody of the child.\nThen, on the other branch of the case\u2014We have had an opportunity of considering the case and considering the judgments below. We see no reason to disagree with the views upon which Mr. Justice Kingstone and the majority of the Judges in the Court of Appeal acted, to the effect that it is not in the interests of the child that the application of the appellant should be granted.\nFor these reasons the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W.B. McHenry.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Nesbitt, McMurtry & Ganong.\n[1] [1934] Ont. W.N. 389.\n[2] [1934] Ont. W.N. 389.\n",

C.\nThe appellant was convicted of murder. Evidence was given at the trial that in the middle of the night, one day after the murder, the accused was removed from his cell and, escorted by three police officers, was taken out a road in search of the revolver that shot the victim. The accused was cross-examined on the incidents of that trip and one police officer testified in rebuttal as to the course of conduct and the conversation of the accused on that occasion.\nHeld that there should be a new trial. Under the circumstances of the case, such evidence was inadmissible in the absence of proof that the statements made by the accused were voluntary and upon proper warning; and the curative effect of section 1014 (2) of the Criminal Code cannot be applied, as it cannot properly be said that there has been \u201cno substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.\u201d Judgment of the Supreme Court in banco (8 M.P.R. 407) rev.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco[1], affirming the conviction of the appellant upon trial for murder.\nThe appellant was convicted at Sydney of the murder of one Cleo Markadonis, his brother\u2019s wife. She was killed by a 32-calibre revolver bullet. The murder was committed about 4 o\u2019clock p.m. on July 20, 1934.\nD. A. Cameron K.C. for the appellant.\nJ. H. MacQuarrie K.C. and M. A. Patterson for the respondent\nThe judgment of Duff C.J. and Lamont J. and Dysart J. ad hoc was delivered by\nDuff C.J.\u2014In his dissenting judgment Mr. Justice Mellish says:\nDealing with ground no. 7 the objection is taken to the part of the charge dealing with the evidence of Hickey in the language set out in said notice when the learned judge comments on the alleged\u2019 failure of Hickey to see the prisoner come from the back of the house to the garage.\nI think the language used suggests that Hickey who was a Crown witness is keeping back further evidence damaging to the accused. I do not think the suggestion is justified. In the interest of the accused it is a dangerous suggestion because at best it has no probative value and it is doubly dangerous because it may not be justified by the facts.\nThe eighth grounds of complaint is I think justified, and there is considerable evidence I think corroborating the prisoner\u2019s evidence that he did walk down Marconi street.\nThe ninth ground of complaint is to the effect that the learned trial judge expressed his own views as to the prisoner\u2019s credibility unfairly in using the words therein set out.\nIn dealing with the probable effect of these words we should I think look at the precise circumstances under which they were used. The prisoner gave evidence on his own behalf and on his cross-examination he was repeatedly asked in effect what his opinion was as to the veracity of several Crown witnesses. The questions were I think irrelevant and should not have been asked, and it appears surprising that they were not objected to. The answers to such questions might prejudice the accused before the jury, and I cannot conceive of any legitimate reason for asking them. It is a method of cross examination which I think is unfair and should not be resorted to nor allowed especially in a case like the present: Regina v. Bernard[2]; McMillan v. Walker[3]; North Australian Territory Co. v. Goldsborough Mort & Co.[4]. Subsequent events I think leave no doubt as to the purpose for which this method was adopted.\nThe learned judge in dealing with the evidence of the witness Beard remarks: \u201cThe prisoner says he is not telling the truth, and he is asking twelve reasonable and intelligent men to believe that Beard came to this court and committed perjury.\u201d The learned judge then almost at once expresses his view as to the credibility of the prisoner in the language complained of. I think in view of what had previously been said the jury might have reasonably inferred that they might come to the same conclusion more especially as the prisoner had accused \u201ca responsible and intelligent looking man\u201d of committing perjury, and that they would have to find this charge proven if they believed the prisoner. The tenth ground of objection is to the admission of evidence. The police, when the prisoner was under arrest obtained damaging statements from him which were not shewn to be voluntary and which nevertheless were put in evidence against him. The only justification suggested for putting in such evidence was that it was given in rebuttal. This is in my opinion no real justification for putting in statements which are prima facie not voluntary. I am unable to say that the jury would have reached the same conclusion if this evidence had not been admitted. It was obviously, I think, put in to influence the jury and was calculated to influence them to the prisoner\u2019s detriment.\nI entirely agree in this.\nMr. Justice Carroll in his dissenting judgment says:\nThere is one ground raised, however, which merits very grave consideration. This concerns the rebuttal evidence given by officer Churchill. I do not think any of the evidence given by Churchill as rebuttal was in fact rebuttal, but the right of the Crown to give evidence other than rebuttal with the permission of the trial judge, after the defence has closed its case, cannot be challenged.\nThe objection to this evidence is as to its admissibility; that certain statements made by the accused to the officers, while out on the Morien road the night after the tragedy, were in their nature incriminating and therefore could not be admitted as evidence, because the trial judge was not invited to and did not rule that the statements were made voluntarily.\nIt was argued by counsel for the Crown that these statements were admissions not in the nature of confessions, and not in their nature incriminating and therefore not subject to the rule that decision must be made on their voluntary character before they became admissible. It is rather surprising that if that was the opinion of the learned counsel that he did not tender the evidence as part of the Crown\u2019s main case when officer Churchill was first called.\nThe accused under cross-examination was asked, in reference to his midnight trip over the Morien road with the police officers, \u201cDid you tell the officers that you threw the revolver away on the Morien road?\u201d He did not answer that question directly, but went on to narrate certain circumstances under which he was required to go out on this midnight expedition and of the existence of conditions going over and while there. If those conditions existed and the circumstances narrated are true (and I think officer Churchill practically admits their truth) then no judge would admit as voluntary any statement made under those circumstances. Churchill testified: \u201cWe asked him why he did not go and find the gun, and he said, we did not let him go far enough, and he said let us go back a little farther and when he came back he said we would have better luck in the day time.\u201d The learned trial judge told the jury that accused must have known that they were over there looking for the gun that shot Cleo Markadonis.\nNow this statement of accused does not amount to what is known as a \u201cplenary\u201d confession but is a statement which gives rise to an inference that he hid the revolver which shot Cleo Markadonis for whose murder he was being tried and a further inference is that he shot her with that revolver. It is a self-harming statement which thrown into the mass of circumstantial evidence would lend much weight and strength to the chain.\nI think under the circumstances that the evidence was not admissible. If however by any chance it was rightly admitted, in such case I think there should have been an instruction to the jury as to the weight of that evidence and what his state of mind would be under the circumstances, and whether he made the statement in order to escape a situation which to say the least could not be pleasant to him. If admissible for the reason that an acknowledgment of guilt cannot reasonably be inferred from the language attributed to the accused, then I think the trial judge should caution the jury as to its true effect. Rex v. Christie[5].\nHowever, I do not think that my brother judges with whom I differ seriously suggest that the evidence of the statement is under the circumstances admissible. Their judgment is based I think on the curative effect of the Criminal Code, section 1014 (2), that notwithstanding the reception of the inadmissible evidence \u201cno substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has actually occurred\u201d and therefore there should not be a new trial.\nThis section or its equivalent has been the subject of inquiry and controversy in our own and in English courts. I shall refer to three precedents: Allen v. The King[6]; Makin v. The Attorney-General of New South Wales[7]; and Maxwell v. The Director of Public Prosecutions[8]. In the Makin case7 the Lords of the Privy Council decided that a section of the Criminal Law Amendment Act of New South Wales (\u201cProvided that no conviction or judgment thereon shall be reversed, arrested or avoided on any case so stated unless for some substantial wrong or other miscarriage of justice\u201d) does not on its true construction empower the court to affirm a conviction where the evidence submitted to the jury was inadmissible and may have influenced the verdict. In that case the Lord Chancellor said (pp. 69, 70): \u201cReliance was of course placed upon the language of the proviso. It was said that if without the inadmissible evidence there was evidence sufficient to sustain the verdict and to show the accused was guilty, there has been no substantial wrong or other miscarriage of justice. It is obvious that the construction contended for transfers from the jury to the court the determination of the question whether the evidence\u2014that is to say what the law regards as evidence\u2014established the guilt of the accused. In their Lordships\u2019 opinion substantial wrong would be done to the accused if he were deprived of the verdict of a jury on the facts proved by legal evidence and there were substituted for it the verdict of the court founded merely upon the perusal of the evidence.\u201d Then his Lordship pointed out that there is ample scope for the operation of the proviso, where the evidence improperly admitted can have no possible influence on the jury \u201cas for example where some merely formal matter not bearing direct on the guilt or innocence of the accused has been proved by other than legal evidence.\u201d In the Allen case[9] the Supreme Court of Canada followed the Makin case (2) and held that the inadmissible evidence may have influenced the verdict of the jury. The Chief Justice in that case said (p. 339): \u201cI cannot agree that the effect of the section is to do more than give the judges on an appeal a discretion which they may be trusted to exercise only where the illegal evidence or other irregularities are so trivial that it may safely be assumed that the jury was not influenced by it. If there is any doubt about this the prisoner must get the benefit of the doubt propter favorem vit\u0153.\u201d\nIt should be observed that the proviso in the Canadian Criminal Code is not expressed in the same language as the English statute. It is very important to note that in our Code the proviso requires that a conviction or judgment shall not be quashed except for \u201csome substantial wrong\u201d or some miscarriage of justice.\nIn Makin\u2019s case[10], it was said by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, speaking through Lord Herschell, that it cannot\nproperly be said that there has been no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice where, on a point material to the guilt or innocence of the accused, the jury have, notwithstanding objection, been invited by the judge to consider in arriving at their verdict matters which ought not to have been submitted to them.\nThe learned trial judge did not, before admitting evidence of what occurred between the accused and the police officers, decide, as it was his duty to do, that what the accused said was voluntary.\nNow, it is quite true that evidence wrongfully admitted may be of a character so trivial that it could not affect the result. We agree with the dissenting judges in the view that this cannot be affirmed with regard to the evidence adduced in rebuttal which was objected to. The learned trial judge emphasized with a good deal of vigour the evidence adduced concerning that episode.\nWe do not think, moreover, in considering the probable effect of the evidence, that the accused was imputing perjury to the witnesses against him as suggested by counsel for the Crown in his questions addressed to the accused, which suggestion was impressively commented upon by the learned trial judge in his charge. Nor should we overlook the circumstance that while the case for the Crown was powerfully presented to the jury in the judge\u2019s charge, the considerations weighing in favour of the prisoner were by no means brought out with their full effect.\nWe think, for the reasons given by the dissenting judges, that there was a mistrial and that the case should be brought before another jury.\nThere will be a new trial.\nCannon J.\u2014The appellant, convicted of murder and sentenced to be hanged for unlawfully killing, on the 20th July, 1934, Cleo Markadonis, his sister-in-law, appeals from the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco on questions of law raised by Mellish J., and Carroll J., dissenting.\nThe majority of the court found that, even if the alleged irregularities in the judge\u2019s charge or the illegal admission of evidence in rebuttal existed, \u201cno substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice had actually occurred,\u201d and that the appeal should therefore be dismissed. The formal order ignores the amendment brought by 21-22 Geo. V, ch. 28, section 14, to article 1013 of the Criminal Code and does not \u201cspecify any ground or grounds in law on which such dissent is based either in whole or in part.\u201d We are therefore compelled to abstract from the opinions of the learned judges the questions which fall within our jurisdiction.\nThe dissenting judgment of Honourable Mr. Justice Mellish apparently deals with the grounds of appeal numbered 7, 7a, 8, 9 and 10, which are as follows:\n(7) Because the learned judge, in his general summing up of Hickey\u2019s evidence, unduly emphasized the time when Hickey first saw the prisoner to the disadvantage of the prisoner, particularly in the following paragraph:\n\u201cThe important fact to remember in this man\u2019s evidence is that however friendly disposed he was towards the prisoner he did not pretend to say that he saw the prisoner in the garage at the time he heard the shot and that the first time he saw him was after he heard Mrs. Markadonis hollering, and stood up. I again state I think that that is rather an extraordinary story for Hickey to tell, that he did not see the prisoner come from the back of the house into the garage.\u201d\n(7a) Because the whole of the learned judge\u2019s charge partook unreasonably of the nature of advocacy against the prisoner, rather than that of impartial presentation of the facts, from the viewpoint of the Crown and the prisoner. (8) Because in making the following comment on the prisoner\u2019s evidence:\n\u201cWhy did not Trysok and Murrant see him on Marconi street at the time? Why did not Mrs. Murrant see him? It is puzzling to me. If this bright young fellow, Peter Trysok, is telling the truth, then the prisoner never walked down Marconi street that day from the Markadonis house\nthe learned judge stated as a fact, that the prisoner never walked down Marconi street that day; whereas he might very well have walked down Marconi street, and Peter Trysok be still telling the truth.\n(9) Because the learned judge, in making the following comment:\n\u201cI personally have no hesitation in stating that, in my opinion at least, his story is a tissue of lies almost from beginning to end, but you will accept that statement subject to the observaion which I have already made that the facts are for you entirely.\u201d\nunduly and unfairly prejudiced the prisoner\u2019s defence, notwithstanding the qualifying words he used.\n(10) Because the evidence of N. W. Churchill, corporal, Royal Canadian Mounted Police, was improperly admitted.\nHis Lordship Mr. Justice Carroll retained only no. 10 and agreed with the other members of the court that the other points were not sufficient to quash the conviction.\nOn grounds of appeal 7-7a-8-9, Mr. Justice Carroll says:\nThe trial judge expressed strong opinions on certain matters of fact and evidence which opinions were not favourable to the accused. A trial judge in summing up has that right so long as he makes it clear to the jury that they are the judges of the facts and are not bound to accept his views. This the learned trial judge did and I do not think it can he said that, either in fact or in effect, he withdrew from the consideration of the jury anything material.\nI agree with Mr. Justice Carroll and the majority of the appellate court in refusing to grant a new trial on account of the judge\u2019s charge to the jury. These alleged misdirections on questions of fact, in view of the repeated warning given to the jury that they were the sole judges of the facts and of the credibility of the witnesses, including the prisoner, could not harm the latter, unless they were accompanied by a misdirection, or constituted a misdirection, on a point of law, which I have been unable to find after a careful perusal of the summing up.\nThe cardinal point to be determined is the one raised by both the dissenting judges below as to the admissibility in rebuttal of the evidence of sergeant Churchill; and on this I agree with my Lord the Chief Justice that the prisoner\u2019s declaration on his night trip to Morien road while under arrest should not have been given to the jury under the circumstances; and for the reasons recently given by me re Chapdelaine v. The King[11], I would order a new trial.\nDavis J.\u2014In considering whether or not the accused had a fair trial on the charge of murder upon which he was convicted and is under sentence of death, we should observe firstly that there was neither in the evidence at the trial nor in the argument before us the slightest suggestion of any motive that might have prompted the accused in killing his sister-in-law if he was the one who in fact committed the crime; secondly, that the revolver used to commit the crime was not produced and apparently was never found; thirdly, that the accused was only eighteen years of age at the time of the murder.\nThe theory of the Crown is that the accused fired a shot from an old revolver he had secured and then went out on the Marien road and buried the revolver. Evidence was given at the trial that in the middle of the night (a day after the murder) the accused was removed from his cell and, escorted by three police officers, was taken out the Marien road in search of his revolver. The accused was cross-examined at length on the incidents of that trip and his answers were made the basis for rebuttal evidence. The whole course of conduct and conversation of the accused on that trip was clearly inadmissible in the absence of any proof that the statements made were voluntary and upon proper warning. But quite apart from that, it was inadmissible because it was irrelevant. The evidence of the accused himself and of the Crown witness in rebuttal of all that was said and done on that trip proved nothing relevant to the issue, and was inadmissible from its own lack of evidential value. While it was admitted that the accused protested throughout the trip that he did not have a gun the day of the murder and none was found, the story of that midnight trip to the Marien road was pregnant with suspicion that might readily affect the minds of the jury to the prejudice of the accused. The trial of this lad of so heinous an offence should have been devoid of the story of that trip and no matter upon whom the fault lies for its introduction, the very justice of the case requires that there be a new trial.\nMoreover, I cannot escape from the view that the charge of the learned trial judge did not present certain aspects of the case in favour of the accused that should have been dealt with and considered. Firstly, the absence of any proof of motive. While it is not the motive but the intent which is essential, proof of motive becomes of importance where the evidence as here against the accused is entirely circumstantial. Secondly, the possibility if not the probability that fear on the part of the lad may have accounted for his staying away from the house after the murder and for some of his actions subsequently to the murder, might well have been considered by the jury. Nothing whatever was said to the jury that would lead them to face the problem of the possible innocence of the accused.\nIn every view of the case the trial was unsatisfactory and I would grant a new trial.\nAppeal allowed, new trial ordered.\n[1] (1935) 8 M.P.R. 407; 63 Can.

C.R. 31, dismissing its action for alleged infringement by defendant of a patent of invention of an automatic train control apparatus, was dismissed on the ground that no infringement was established. It was held that the claims sued upon, as regards the devices in the apparatus on the vehicle which respond to the \u201ccaution\u201d and \u201cdanger\u201d signals, when these claims are properly construed in relation to the specification as a whole, do not contemplate a system which could be effectively worked without the use of alternating current circuits; and since defendant employed direct current circuits alone, no infringement was established. Further, the opinion was expressed that, on construction of the specification as a whole, the monopoly contemplated by the claims relied on by plaintiff would not embrace a system in which the responsive inductive device employs cumulative and not opposing fluxes; and that the defendant\u2019s system would not be practically operable if a responsive inductive device making use of opposing fluxes were substituted for the device operating with cumulative fluxes which was actually part of its system.\nIt is the duty of a patentee to describe in unambiguous terms his invention and the manner in which it is to be put into effect.\nOne cannot by reference import into a claim the description in the specification minus any part of it which describes some essential feature of it.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], dismissing its action for an injunction and damages and other relief for the alleged infringement of a patent, issued to one Schweyer and assigned to plaintiff, for improvements in automatic train control apparatus. The appeal was dismissed with costs.\nO. M. Biggar K.C. and M. B. Gordon for the appellant.\nW. F. Chipman K.C. and V. W. Price K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nDuff C.J.\u2014The patentee, in explaining the objects of his invention, describes it as an \u201cAutomatic Train Controlling Apparatus\u201d and proceeds:\nIt is an object of the invention to provide novel inductive devices between the vehicle and track for obtaining clear, caution and danger or other signals or conditions in an efficacious manner when passing the controlling points or stations of the track.\nHe also says:\nA still further object is the provision in such an apparatus of a novel differential induction responsive device for controlling the vehicle equipment or translating means and controlled by suitable inductive devices on the track or adjacent to the path of movement of the responsive device.\nUnder the head of \u201cVehicle Equipment,\u201d the \u201ctranslating means\u201d is thus described:\nThe train part of the apparatus includes the clear electromagnet 17, which when energized maintains clear conditions, and the caution electromagnet 18 which when energized with the magnet 17 deenergized provides caution conditions, while when both electromagnets 17 and 18 are de-energized, the equipment will be in danger condition. These electromagnets 17 and 18 therefore control the movement of the train by operating suitable mechanism such as shown in United States Patent No. 1,389,602.\nFor a general description of the leading essentials of the apparatus for controlling the translating devices (electromagnets 17 and 18), we turn to the outline of the apparatus as given in the patent:\nBriefly outlined, the present apparatus comprises in its main and more important essentials, armatures 16 or magnetic devices on the track or roadway at the control stations or locations, a primary inductor 19 on the vehicle responsively affected whenever passing an armature, control relays or devices on the vehicle for obtaining clear, caution and danger conditions, a controller or switch device 45 on the vehicle controlled by the primary inductor 19 for changing the circuit connections of said control relays or devices whenever passing a control station and initiating a danger condition of said control relays or devices, secondary inductors 68 and 69 and relays 78 and 80 controlled thereby on the vehicle controlling said control relays or devices during such change in circuit connections, controlled inductors 2 and 3 on the track or roadway associated with said armatures for influencing said secondary inductors during such change in circuit connections to avoid the danger conditions and either maintain the existing running condition of the vehicle equipment or changing from a clear to a caution condition, and manually controlled means for restoring clear conditions of the vehicle equipment. The essential apparatus as outlined, with the necessary electrical circuits, is more simple than the complete apparatus as illustrated, such complete apparatus also including several features of safety which are not compulsory.\nThe patent plainly contemplates that the translating devices (electromagnets 17 and 18) are to be controlled by the combined action of two sequences of apparatus. Of the inductive devices on the vehicle, the inductor 19 is energized by direct current (generator 24), co-operating with the track armature 16, and with one set of contacts on the switch 45, as well as with certain relays, while the right and lefthand \u201csecondary inductors\u201d 68 and 69 are energized by alternating current (generator 76), co-operating with the track inductors 2 and 3, and with a set of contacts on switch 45 through which the \u201crelays\u201d 78 and 80 are controlled by these \u201csecondary inductors.\u201d The operation of the secondary inductors 68 and 69, relays 78 and 80 and inductors 2 and 3 admittedly involve the use of alternating current circuits.\nThe operation of the apparatus, as the patent contemplates it, may be sketched as follows: The track armature 16 influences at each control station inductively the primary inductor 18 which deenergizes the relay 33; this causes the switch 45 to fall and, in consequence, the energy is transferred from the circuit operating-relays 109 and 110 to another circuit which is controlled by the alternating current relays 78 and 80. The deenergizing of relay 33 produces no effect upon the translating devices (electromagnets 17 and 18) but merely establishes alternative circuits making it possible to energize or de-energize these devices by the operation of the alternating current devices 78 and 80 in accordance with traffic conditions. Under \u201ccaution,\u201d the co-operation of inductor 3 with coil 70 and coil 68, relay 78 is deenergized immediately as the car passes over inductor 3 and this momentarily opens the contact 86 and leaves closed the alternative circuit.\nUnder \u201cdanger,\u201d by means of inductor 2, coil 69, relay 80 is deenergized and contact 85 is opened momentarily and by this means the alternative circuits for both translating devices 17 and 18 are deenergized. The switch 45 rises to its upper position and \u201cclear\u201d or \u201ccaution\u201d is maintained until the next controlling station is reached.\nThe control of the translating devices in the manner disclosed by the patent thus requires two sets of trackway inductors and two trains of mechanism involving in their operation the use of both direct current circuits and alternating current circuits.\nThe plaintiff selected certain claims as typical of the claims in suit. Of these, claims 12, 37 and 43 state explicitly that the claims are concerned with an apparatus of the character described including specified appliances and devices. Claims 66 and 91, as framed, concern a railway traffic control system in combination. It will be convenient to reproduce these claims in full:\n12. An apparatus of the character described including a movably mounted differential inductive device including a core and inductively related coils thereon, an armature adjacent to the path of movement of said device with which said core is inductively cooperable for obtaining . magnetic disturbance in said core when passing said armature, soid coils being in direct current energized electrical circuits and creating opposing magnetic flux in said core so that the current in one coil is affected when passing the armature, and translating means controlled by the circuit of said coil. 37. An apparatus of the character described including a movably mounted differential inductive device energized by different direct current circuits, a relay in each of said circuits, and the relay in one circuit controlling the current in the other circuit, translating means controlled by said relays and means adjacent to the path of movement of said device and with which said device is inductively cooperable to affect the currents in said circuits for deenergizing one of said relays.\n43. An apparatus of the character described including a movably mounted differential inductive device having direct current energized inductively related coils, one of which produces a magnetic flux weaker than and in opposition to the magnetic flux created by the other coil, a stick relay in series circuit with the coil producing the weaker magnetic flux, inductive means adjacent to the path of movement of said device with which said device is cooperable for reducing the current flowing in the first-named coil to deenergize said stick relay and translating means controlled by said stick relay.\n66. In a railway traffic controlling system, the combination, a railway track, magnetic devices on the trackway at intervals, a vehicle on the track, an inductor on the vehicle aligning with said magnetic devices and passing in inductive relation thereover by the movement of the vehicle along the tract:, a primary circuit including a protection relay connected with said inductor and energized by direct current, a secondary circuit energized by direct current and including a detector relay controlling its own circuit and inductively coupled through said inductor with said primary circuit, said primary circuit being connected to said inductor so as to deenergize said detector relay when said inductor is in inductive relation with said magnetic device, said secondary circuit controlled by said protection relay and a translating device controlled by said detector relay.\n91. In a railway traffic controlling system, in combination, a railway track, an armature on said track, a vehicle on said track, an inductor on said vehicle moved by the movement of said vehicle into inductive relation with said armature, a primary coil on said inductor energized by direct current, a secondary coil in a secondary circuit including a relay controlling its own circuit energized by direct current and inductively coupled by said inductor so that said primary coil effectively deenergizes said relay when said inductor is influenced by said armature, an electrically operated braking mechanism on said vehicle, a second relay controlling its own circuit, controlling said braking mechanism and controlled by the relay in said secondary circuit and a manually operated switch for establishing an energizing circuit for said second relay.\nIn construing these claims they must be read with reference to the earlier part of the specification and, so reading them, it seems to me the conclusion is inevitable\u2014I am convinced this is not putting it too strongly\u2014that, as regards the devices in the apparatus on the vehicle which respond to the \u201ccaution\u201d and \u201cdanger\u201d signals, these claims do not contemplate a system which could be effectively worked without the use of alternating current circuits. In that view, since the respondents employ direct current circuits alone, no infringement is established. This is sufficient to dispose of the appeal. But my opinion is, I may add, that the phrase \u201cdifferential inductive responsive device\u201d in the earlier part of the patent ought to be construed by reference to the language of that part of the specification which is under the heading \u201cIntermittent Responsive Devices,\u201d and, so reading it, the phrase seems plainly to imply the use of opposing fluxes.\nIn claims 12, 37 and 43, opposing fluxes are either implied in the sense indicated, or are explicitly postulated. As regards these claims, at least, it seems to me impossible to aver that the patent has so defined the limits of the monopoly claimed as to embrace, in reasonably clear language, inductive devices with cumulative fluxes. I am inclined also to think that the two remaining typical claims (66 and 91) must be read as importing the essentials of the invention described in the specification. As regards these claims, it appears to me that this may reasonably be said. It is the duty of the patentee to describe in unambiguous terms his invention and the manner in which it is to be put into effect. He has already, in the specification, described his invention and its mode of operation. And the essential features of the invention, and the working of it, so described, as I construe the specification include the use of \u201cdifferential inductive responsive devices\u201d involving the employment of opposing fluxes. If the description can be imported into these claims by reference then the disclosure is sufficient, but I do not think you can by reference import the description minus any part of it which describes some essential feature of it. In this view, the monopoly contemplated by these claims would not embrace a system in which the responsive inductive device employs cumulative and not opposing fluxes. I think the learned President\u2019s finding of fact is well founded that the respondents\u2019 system would not be practically operable if a responsive inductive device making use of opposing fluxes were substituted for the device operating with cumulative fluxes which is actually part of their system.\nI rest my decision of the appeal, however, upon the first point, viz., that the invention, as described, necessarily involves, as an essential part of it, the employment, in co-operation, of direct current circuits and alternating current circuits.\nThe main contention on behalf of the appellants was that the learned trial judge had not applied his mind to the consideration of the subordinate combinations which they allege are covered by the \u201ctypical\u201d claims. As will sufficiently appear from what I have said, in my view that contention is displaced if one accepts the view that the claims in suit, when properly construed in relation to the specification as a whole, do not define any combination not requiring the use of alternating current circuits.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Smart & Big gar.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Saunders, Kingsmill, Mills & Price.\n[1] [1934] Ex.C.R. 31.\n",

In actions against defendant for damages, the trial judge found that defendant\u2019s motorman and the automobile driver were each negligent to the extent of fifty per cent., and gave judgment against the defendant (for one-half the total damages assessed). The Court of Appeal for Ontario held that on the evidence defendant could not be found guilty of any negligence causing the accident, and dismissed the actions. On appeal to this Court:\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the judgment at trial restored.\nPer Duff C.J., Cannon and Davis JJ. and Dysart J. ad hoc: Generally speaking, a street car motorman is entitled to assume that a pedestrian or motorist approaching the track will stop to permit the street car to pass by, and there was in the present case a statutory right of way in favour of the street car; but the existence of a right of way does not entitle the motorman to disregard an apparent danger that confronts him. In the circumstances appearing in the present case, the motorman should have seen the automobile and realized the probability of its driver continuing in his course across the track at the approaching intersection. Had either the motorman or the motorist used due care or caution, the collision would not have occurred.\nPer Duff C.J. and Crocket J.: The real effective cause of the collision was the joint negligence of the motorist and motorman. It was the motorman\u2019s duty in approaching the street intersection to have his street car under such control as to enable him to stop in order to avoid hitting any person venturing across the street in his path, as it was the duty of the motorist to have his car under similar control. On the evidence, both approached the intersection at such a rate of speed as to create at the intersection a peril which it was then too late for either to avoid.\nAPPEALS (a consolidation of two appeals) by the plaintiffs from judgments of the Court of Appeal for Ontario allowing the defendant\u2019s appeal from judgments of McEvoy J. on the trial.\nThe actions were brought against defendant in the Supreme Court of Ontario, and arose from a collision between an automobile driven by S.W. Abbott and a street car of defendant on the evening of November 22, 1932, at the intersection of Harbour and Bay streets in the city of Toronto, causing injuries to Mr. Abbott from which he died.\nThe first action was brought by the administrator of Mr. Abbott\u2019s estate to recover damages under the Fatal Accidents Act, R.S.O. 1927, c. 183, and the second action was brought by the said administrator to recover damages for medical and nursing expenses and by Mr. Abbott\u2019s widow to recover for damages to the automobile which belonged to her. The actions were tried together before McEvoy J., who found that defendant (by its motorman) and Mr. Abbott, deceased, were each negligent to the extent of fifty per cent., and in the first action gave judgment for the plaintiff for $10,000, and in the second action gave judgment for the plaintiff administrator for $124.40 and for the plaintiff Mrs. Abbott for $300 (the said sums being in each case one-half the total damages assessed).\nThe defendant appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario in both actions and the appeals were heard together. The Court of Appeal held that on the evidence the defendant could not be found guilty of any negligence causing the accident, and allowed the appeals and dismissed the actions.\nThe Court of Appeal granted to the plaintiffs special leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada in the second action.\nThe material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment of Davis J. now reported. The appeal to this Court was allowed and the judgment of the trial Judge restored, with costs throughout.\nD.L. McCarthy K.C. and G.M. Huycke for the appellants.\nIrving S. Fairty K.C. and Geo. A. McGillivray for the respondent.\nDUFF C.J.\u2014I concur with the conclusions and the reasons of my brother Crocket and of my brother Davis.\nCROCKET J. (Concurred in by Duff C.J.)\u2014I entirely concur in the view of the learned trial Judge that the real effective cause of this unfortunate collision was the joint negligence of the deceased driver of the automobile and of the motorman of the street car. It was the duty of the motorman in approaching the street intersection to have his car under such control as to enable him to stop in order to avoid hitting any person venturing across Bay street in his path, as it was the duty of the driver of the automobile to have his car under similar control. The evidence shows clearly, I think, that both approached the inter- section at such a rate of speed as to create at the intersection a peril which it was then too late for either to avoid. With deference, I think it is a clear case for the application of the provisions of the Contributory Negligence Act and would therefore allow the appeal and restore the trial judgment with costs throughout.\nDAVIS J. (Concurred in by Duff C.J. and Cannon J. and Dysart J. ad hoc).\u2014I cannot escape from the view which I formed during the hearing of this appeal and which is confirmed upon a careful reading of the evidence and a review of the authorities discussed before us, that the motorman on the street car should have seen the automobile and realized the probability of its driver continuing in his course across the street car track at the approaching intersection.\nGenerally speaking, a motorman on a street car is entitled to assume that a pedestrian or a motorist approaching the street car tracks will stop to permit the street car to pass by and there was in this case a statutory right of way in favour of the street car. But the existence of a right of way does not entitle the motorman on the street car to disregard an apparent danger that confronts him.\nThe facts are simple and are not in dispute. The collision occurred shortly after eleven o\u2019clock at night at the intersection of Bay and Harbour streets in the city of Toronto at what may be described as the waterfront of the city. It was a clear, cold November night and the pavement was dry. The driver of the automobile was travelling along Harbour street in an easterly direction and the street car was travelling southerly on Bay street. Both streets are asphalt paved and of exceptional width, the width of Bay street being 54 feet from curb to curb and that of Harbour street being 60 feet from curb to curb. There is a street car line on Bay street but none on Harbour street. The view approaching the intersection from any direction is unobstructed by buildings or fences, the only building in the vicinity being the Harbour Commission Building on the north side of Harbour street, 159 feet west of the corner of Bay street. There are no grades of consequence at this point on either street and the intersection and approaches are well lighted. There was only one eye- witness of the collision called to give evidence. He put the speed of the automobile at between thirty and thirty-five miles an hour and that of the street car prior to it entering the intersection at twenty-two miles an hour. He did not notice any passengers in the street car but at the point of collision he saw the conductor standing \u201cabout the joining position of the vestibule and the body of the car.\u201d He says the street car came to the intersection without slackening speed and the automobile failed to shew any indication to him of slackening its speed, until in such a position that an accident was inevitable. The headlights of the motor car were burning. The street car struck the motor car square-on, the glass in the headlight of the street car was broken and the door in the middle of the side of the motor car was jammed. The driver of the motor car was alone in his car; he never regained consciousness and died within a week as the direct result of the injuries sustained by him in the collision. That he was himself guilty of negligence is not in dispute. The question is whether the motorman on the street car was negligent. Neither the motorman nor the conductor on the street car was called as a witness and no explanation has been offered for their not being called although the defendant undertook the defence without making any motion for a non-suit at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case. The defence consisted solely in the putting in of a by-law of the City of Toronto requiring all persons on any street to comply with the requirements of every sign erected for the purpose of regulating or directing traffic, and another by-law of the City entrusting to the respondent commission the control, maintenance, operation and management of the street railway system. The absence of any evidence from either the motorman or the conductor on the street car is not without significance, and we are entitled to draw reasonable inferences from such oral testimony as was given at the trial. The learned trial Judge in effect found that each driver was guilty of negligence and that the negligence of each was a direct cause of the accident and, treating the case as one of concurrent negligence, attributed fault equally between the parties. The appellants, who are the widow and the administrator of the estate of the deceased driver of the motor car, did not appeal from the judgment in their favour in the amount of one-half the damages assessed by the trial judge. The respondent did appeal from the judgment against it of one-half of the damages assessed and the Court of Appeal for Ontario allowed the appeal and dismissed the actions with costs. One action was by the administrator under the Fatal Accidents Act and the other action was brought by the administrator and the widow to recover medical and hospital expenses and damage to the automobile. The actions were tried together and the appeals in the two actions were consolidated by order of the Registrar of this Court. No question was raised as to the quantum of damages. The only question before us was the negligence, if any, of the motorman in the street car.\nThe learned trial Judge came to the conclusion that the motorman\nshould have seen that at some stage as the automobile proceeded along the road there was a certainty that if the street car continued to go as it was going, and if the automobile continued on its course at the rate it was going, there was bound to be a collision. I think there was a time and place where the motorman should have realized that there was going to be an accident if he did not pay some attention to the fact that the driver of the automobile would arrive at the place at which the street car would arrive at such a time, and that it was necessary for him to be careful. I think there was a time\u2014I am not necessarily called upon to say how long a time it was, but looking at the whole picture I think there was a time at which, by taking proper care and caution, the motor\u2011man could and ought to have stopped the street car and avoided this calamity.\nThe test that may well be applied to the facts of this case was stated by Lord Dunedin in the House of Lords in Fardon v. Harcourt-Rivington[1] in these words:\nThe root of this liability is negligence, and what is negligence depends on the facts with which you have to deal. If the possibility of the danger emerging is reasonably apparent, then to take no precautions is negligence; but if the possibility of danger emerging is only a mere possibility which would never occur to the mind of a reasonable man, then there is no negligence in not having taken extraordinary precautions.\nIn the absence of any evidence from the motorman on the street car it is impossible to find in the evidence when he first saw the motor car or when he first applied his brakes or used sand or attempted to avert the accident. These were all matters of fact upon which the motorman could have thrown very considerable light. But the de- fendant chose not to call him as a witness and we are left to draw whatever inferences are reasonable and proper from the oral testimony that was given at the trial.\nIn my view, had either the motorman on the street car or the driver of the automobile used due care or caution, the collision would not have taken place; and that was substantially the view taken by the learned trial Judge. The appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the trial Judge restored with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Osler, Hoskin and Harcourt.\nSolicitor for the respondent: I.S. Fairty.\n[1] (1932) 48 Times L.R. 215, at 216.\n",

There was conflicting evidence as to the manner and exact place of the accident. Defendant contended that plaintiff came fast down M. avenue and ran into the motor car at the street intersection. It was contended for plaintiff that he had turned off M. avenue and proceeded westerly along Q. street and was struck by the motor car about 50 feet west of M. avenue. Plaintiff\u2019s action for damages was tried with a jury, who, in answer to questions, found that defendant had not satisfied the jury that the accident did not arise through any negligence or improper conduct on defendant\u2019s part; that defendant\u2019s negligence causing the accident was \u201cin not exercising the proper amount of care to avoid striking boy who was on the highway going west\u201d: that plaintiff could not have avoided the accident by exercising reasonable care; and assessed damages, for which plaintiff was given judgment. The Court of Appeal for Ontario, taking the view that it was \u201calmost impossible to form any opinion as to exactly what had taken place,\u201d that the \u201cextraordinary large amount\u201d of damages \u201ccould only be justified by a finding of serious permanent injury,\u201d that the trial was of a \u201cgenerally unsatisfactory nature,\u201d and that there was \u201cthe possibility of the production of more satisfactory evidence at a new hearing,\u201d set aside the judgment at trial and ordered a new trial. Plaintiff appealed.\nHeld: (1) The judgment of the Court of Appeal was not a \u201cjudgment or order made in the exercise of judicial discretion\u201d within s. 38 of the Supreme Court Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 35); and an appeal lay to this Court.\n(2) The judgment for plaintiff at trial should be restored. There was evidence on which the jury could find as they did; and their conclusions ought not to be disturbed merely because they were not such as judges sitting in courts of appeal might themselves have arrived at (Toronto Railway Co. v. King, [1908] A.C. 260, at 270; Mechanical, etc., Co. v. Austin, [1935] A.C. 340, at 375, cited). The reasons expressed by the Court of Appeal (discussed in the judgment of this Court) did not shew grounds to justify a new trial in this case.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiffs from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario.\nThe plaintiffs sued for damages for personal injuries suffered by the infant plaintiff (a boy about 14 years of age) when he and the bicycle on which he was riding were struck, so it was alleged, by a motor car driven by the defendant.\nThe trial was before Kingstone J. with a jury. On the jury\u2019s findings (set out in the judgment now reported), judgment was directed to be entered for the plaintiffs. The Court of Appeal set aside the judgment at trial and ordered a new trial. The plaintiffs appealed to this Court.\nThe infant plaintiff had sued by his next friend, his mother, who had also sued for herself for hospital, medical and other expenses incurred. The jury had found the damages in one sum, $15,000, which was divided by the trial judge into two sums, one of $669.75 for the adult plaintiff, and one of $14,330.25 for the infant plaintiff. The appeal of the adult plaintiff to this Court was abandoned, the amount in controversy being insufficient to give jurisdiction without special leave.\nThe material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal by the infant plaintiff to this Court was allowed and the judgment at trial in his favour restored, with costs throughout.\nR.R. McMurtry and E.J.R. Wright for the appellants.\nJ.M. Macintosh for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nDAVIS J.\u2014This action arose out of what may be termed, perhaps inaccurately but for convenience, a collision between a motor car and a bicycle on a public highway at a point a short distance outside the westerly limits of the city of Toronto. The bicycle was being ridden by a boy of fourteen years and he was undoubtedly seriously injured. His widowed mother brought this action, as his next friend, for damages for the injuries sustained by him and she joined personally as a plaintiff in the action to recover payments made by her for medical and hospital services and sundry other expenses incurred by her as a result of the accident. The defendant is the owner and driver of the motor car.\nIt is common ground that the motor car and the bicycle came into collision on Queen street (which runs east and west) though the exact location of the collision on Queen street having regard to Macdonald avenue (which runs north and south) is highly controversial on the evidence and is in large measure the turning point in the case. Queen street has a paved highway, the concrete being 23 feet 9 inches wide. It is what is called a \u201cthrough\u201d highway and is a much travelled road. Macdonald avenue has neither a paved road nor sidewalks. A cinder path serves for pedestrians. There is a noticeable incline on Macdonald avenue as it runs southerly into Queen street and there is a \u201cStop\u201d sign on Macdonald avenue close to the point of its intersection with Queen street.\nThe defendant was driving his car westerly along Queen street and the boy on the bicycle had come down Macdonald avenue on the cinder path. There were two theories advanced as to the exact location and cause of the accident. The defendant\u2019s theory is that the boy on the bicycle came down the cinder path on Macdonald avenue at a fast rate of speed, entered upon Queen street without stopping and ran right into the defendant\u2019s motor car just as the motor car was passing Macdonald avenue, striking the motor car in the centre of one of the side doors of the car. The other theory, advanced on behalf of the boy, is that he had turned off Macdonald avenue and was at the time of the collision proceeding westerly along Queen street, about 4 or 5 feet from the northerly side of the paved road, when at a point about 50 feet west of Macdonald avenue the motor car overtook him; the right front bumper and fender of the motor car striking the bicycle with such force as to cause the injuries. If the latter theory is correct, the motor car and the bicycle were travelling in more or less parallel lines along Queen street for a distance of some 50 feet. The two theories are obviously irreconcilable. There were very few witnesses of the accident and all persons who had any real knowledge of the facts and circumstances appear to have been called at the trial. In the very nature of a sudden accident of this kind it is not surprising that there was a very considerable conflict in the testimony as to the exact details and measurements. The case, which was essentially one of fact for a jury, was tried with a jury.\nThe following were the questions submitted to the jury and their answers:\n1. Has the defendant, Taylor Storey, satisfied you that the accident in question did not arise through any negligence or improper conduct on his part? Answer yes or no. A. No.\n2. If your answer to Question No. 1 is \u201cno,\u201d then state fully wherein the driver was guilty of negligence which caused the accident to the plaintiff. A. In not exercising the proper amount of care to avoid striking boy who was on the highway going west.\n3. If your answer to Question No. 1 is \u201cno,\u201d then state if in your opinion the infant plaintiff could have avoided the accident by exercising reasonable care. Answer yes or no. A. No.\n4. If your answer to Question No. 3 is \u201cyes,\u201d then state fully what the plaintiff could and should have done which would have avoided the accident. A. (No answer).\n5. At what amount do you assess damages? A. $15,000.\n6. If your answer to Question No. 1 is \u201cno,\u201d and to Question No. 3 your answer is \u201cyes,\u201d then state if you find it practicable to apportion the respective degrees of fault as between the driver and the infant plaintiff. Answer yes or no. (No answer).\n7. If your answer to Question No. 6 is \u201c yes,\u201d then state the respective degrees of fault.\nDriver ....................................................................................................................... Per cent.\nPlaintiff .................................................................................................................... Per cent.\n(No answer). It is plain that the jury accepted the theory advanced on behalf of the boy, in that the jury specifically state that the defendant did not exercise \u201cthe proper amount of care to avoid striking the boy who was on the highway going west.\u201d Apart from the question of the nature and extent of the physical injuries suffered by the boy, the whole case was developed in evidence and put to the jury upon the two conflicting theories of the collision, and if the jury had accepted the defendant\u2019s theory that the boy on the bicycle ran right into the motor car at the intersection of Macdonald avenue with Queen street, they undoubtedly would have said so. Their words \u201cwho was on the highway going west\u201d must be taken to express the acceptance by them of the other theory, that the accident did not occur at the intersection but some fifty feet west of the intersection while the boy was proceeding westerly along Queen street. The issue was very fairly, and I think completely, put to the jury by the learned trial judge. In fact he recalled the jury after some discussion with counsel and charged them explicitly thus:\nIf you find that the plaintiff was the author of his own misfortune, so to speak: he would be the author of his own misfortune if you came to the conclusion that he came down Macdonald avenue and did not stop at the stop sign and ran into this motor car at that point.\nAnd again,\nI spoke to you about Question No. 3, about his contributing to the negligence, and that is another thing altogether. He may not have been entirely the author of his own misfortune, but he may have, by reason of his not stopping, contributed to the cause of the collision. That is entirely for you to say.\nThe two points are quite distinct in that sense, and that is the reason you are asked that as a separate question.\nNot only did the jury expressly find that the accident was caused by the defendant \u201cnot exercising the proper amount of care to avoid striking the boy,\u201d but specifically found that the boy \u201ccould not have avoided the accident by exercising reasonable care.\u201d\nThere was evidence, and in fact a good deal of evidence, in support of the theory that the defendant struck the boy on the bicycle on Queen street about fifty feet west of Macdonald avenue while the boy was proceeding along Queen street in a westerly direction. It is quite impossible for us to say that the jury could not properly find, viewing the whole evidence reasonably, that the place of the accident was where they obviously put it. The evidence was conflicting but the jury was the tribunal entrusted with the duty of determining the issues of fact and their conclusions on such matters are not to be disturbed merely because they are not the conclusions which judges sitting in courts of appeal might themselves have arrived at, to adopt the words of Lord Atkinson in Toronto Railway Co. v. King and another[1].\nCounsel for the defendant very properly urged before us the duty in law that rested upon the boy to stop his bicycle at the foot of Macdonald avenue before entering upon Queen street, a through highway. But that point was thoroughly canvassed in evidence at the trial and the jury, in our view, was properly directed upon it. It is to be observed that the defendant stated in evidence that he was familiar with the district at Queen street and Macdonald avenue; that he knew Macdonald avenue was dangerous and a well used highway; that he would naturally keep a lookout for that particular street; that when he was about forty feet east from Macdonald avenue he observed the boy coming down Macdonald avenue on the bicycle; that he thought the boy\u2019s speed was very fast; and that, while he knew the boy should stop at the intersection, he did not think that the boy in fact would be able to stop. It is one thing for a motor car driver to assume that another person will comply with the law and stop before entering upon a through highway and to govern his conduct in relation to that other person on that assumption; it is quite a different thing for the driver of the motor car to admit that he observed the other person and realized not only the unlikelihood but the apparent inability of the other person at the given time and under given circumstances to stop.\nNow, as to the injuries to the boy. Dr. McKenzie of Toronto, an outstanding brain specialist, described the injuries to the boy under two headings. There was evidence of local injury to the brain in the back part of the head, and, apart from that, there was evidence of a severe general injury to the brain as a whole, a severe concussion. A fragment of bone, probably one and one-half inch, was driven through the covering of the brain into the brain and when that fragment of bone was removed the covering over the brain was badly damaged and the underlying brain was pulped and damaged, and part of it oozed out and had to be removed. There was probability of trouble from injury to the frontal region of the brain and more than a possibility of the boy developing epileptic seizures.\nThe defendant appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario against the judgment in favour of the plaintiffs directed to be entered by the trial judge upon the answers of the jury to the questions submitted. The Court of Appeal unanimously set aside the judgment and directed a new trial. From that judgment the plaintiffs appealed to this Court. It is necessary, therefore, that we examine the written reasons given by the Court of Appeal for their judgment. The Court did not discuss the problem that was presented to the jury at the trial as to which of two theories of the accident was to be accepted or the real effect of the language of the jury as giving expression to the acceptance of one or other of the theories. The judgment does not discuss the evidence except to state as facts that the collision took place \u201cat or near\u201d the intersection and that the plaintiff did not stop before entering the intersection and \u201capparently struck the front door of the defendant\u2019s car with much force denting the door and suffering somewhat severe injury.\u201d The Court of Appeal obviously took a view of the evidence that was rejected upon conflicting evidence by the jury. The Court concluded that \u201cit is almost impossible to form any opinion as to exactly what had taken place.\u201d Assuming that to be so, then the defendant had not satisfied the statutory obligation, which rested upon him as the owner and driver of the motor car, of establishing that the accident did not arise through his negligence or improper conduct (sec. 42 (1) of the Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O. 1927, ch. 251), and that is exactly what the jury said in answer to the first question. Upon that state of fact, the plaintiffs were entitled to judgment. In our view, it was not impossible for the jury to come to a conclusion as to exactly what had taken place. There are difficulties in the case, as there are in all these motor collision cases, but that does not mean that the jury is not entitled to accept one of two or more conflicting stories of what in fact took place. The reasons for the judgment appealed against proceed further to state that \u201cthe medical evidence was extremely confusing, some of the doctors and the mother\u201d suggesting that the disposition of the boy has been changed as a result of the accident. As a matter of fact there were only two doctors called, and both of these on behalf of the plaintiffs. Dr. McKenzie was the only doctor called to give opinion evidence. Dr. Dalrymple merely spoke of the condition of the boy as he saw and examined him in the hospital. We cannot, with respect, agree that the medical evidence was in any way confusing. The judgment further proceeds to state that \u201cthere is no corroboration of the mother\u2019s evidence as to the character of the boy before the accident.\u201d But there can be no legal consequence to the absence of corroboration of statements by the mother as to the disposition of the boy before and after the accident. The jury saw both the mother and the boy and heard their evidence, and the weight to be attached to their evidence was entirely a matter for the jury. The judgment further states the amount of damages was an \u201cextraordinary large amount\u201d but does not say that in the opinion of the Court the amount was either unreasonable or excessive. The amount is large but not so large as to disclose an entirely wrong principle in its ascertainment or an entirely unreasonable view of the evidence. The Court expressed the view that such damages \u201ccould only be justified by a finding of serious permanent injury.\u201d In our view, there is much more in the evidence than a mere possibility of a very serious permanent injury. The judgment concluded that the trial already had was of a \u201cgenerally unsatisfactory nature\u201d and that there was \u201cthe possibility of the production of more satisfactory evidence at a new hearing.\u201d Neither counsel before us could offer any suggestion as to the possibility of the production of more satisfactory evidence on a new trial than was had on the first trial, and we are at a loss to understand what sort of evidence is now available that was not available and given at the first trial. There were two affidavits sought to be used by the defendant in the Court of Appeal on an application for a new trial, but as these affidavits were not admitted in that Court and were included in the appeal book, by order of Mr. Justice Middleton, only for convenience if this Court should think they should have been received in the Court below, this Court took the same view as the Court below that these affidavits could not be read.\nWith the greatest respect, we cannot agree with the view that the trial was of a generally unsatisfactory nature, and in our opinion the Court of Appeal was not justified in directing a new trial upon any of the grounds referred to in the reasons for their judgment or upon any other ground discussed before us. There was, in our view, no \u201csubstantial wrong or miscarriage\u201d that would have entitled the Court below under sec. 27 of the Ontario Judicature Act, R.S.O. 1927, ch. 88, to grant a new trial. Lord Wright in the House of Lords in the very recent case of Mechanical and General Inventions Co. Ltd. v. Austin[2] said:\nAn appellate court must always be on guard against the tendency to set aside a verdict because the Court feels it would have come to a different conclusion.\nThe appeal must be allowed and the judgment of the learned trial judge restored in so far as the infant plaintiff recovered against the defendant the sum of $14,330.25 to be paid into court to his credit upon the terms of the judgment.\nThe defendant having moved to quash the appeal to this Court of the boy\u2019s mother as a plaintiff in respect of her recovery at the trial of the sum of $669.75, her counsel abandoned her appeal as being an amount in controversy insufficient to give jurisdiction without special leave, and the judgment of the Court of Appeal therefore stands in respect of the rights of the plaintiff mother.\nThe defendant raised before us on a substantive motion, which we enlarged to consider on the hearing of the main appeal, the question of the jurisdiction of this Court to entertain the appeal, upon the ground that the order of the Court sought to be appealed from was \u201ca judgment or order made in the exercise of judicial discretion\u201d and therefore not appealable to this Court under sec. 38 of the Supreme Court Act. Sec. 36 expressly gives a right of appeal from a judgment \u201cdirecting a new trial.\u201d The reasons given by the Court of Appeal for its order directing a new trial were, as in Varette v. Sainsbury[3], insufficient grounds in law upon which to justify an order for a new trial, and the subject matter was not one which by special statute or by its very nature was merely a matter of discretion for the Court below. The motion to quash is therefore dismissed.\nThe costs of the infant plaintiff of this appeal, including the costs of the defendant\u2019s motion to quash, and his costs in the courts below, must be paid by the defendant.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Nesbitt, McMurtry & Ganong.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Macdonald & Macintosh.\n[1] [1908] A.C. 260, at 270.\n[2] [1935] A.C. 346, at 375.\n[3] [1928] Can.

A company (plaintiff\u2019s assignor) and the city made an agreement dated October 13, 1930, whereby (inter alia), the company was to construct by October 1, 1932, and operate for at least ten years, a grain elevator on certain lands; the city was to transfer to the company (for the elevator\u2019s site and operation) part of certain water lots, which the city had applied for to (but not as yet obtained from) the Crown, and certain \u201clands shown in black\u201d on a plan, which lands included certain golf club land, on which the city had secured an option, and a small piece of land thought to belong to the golf club (and to be covered by said option) but in fact still in the Crown; and the company was to deposit certain bonds (those in question) as security for the due construction and completion of the elevator \u201cin the event of\u201d the city conveying to the company the said lands shown in black, \u201cand in the event of the failure\u201d of the city to convey said lands, \u201cthen, as security for the purchase\u201d by the company from the golf club of certain lands in accordance with an agreement between the company and the golf club whereby, in the event of the city failing to exercise its said option (which, however, it did exercise), the company was to purchase certain lands from the club. By a \u201cdeposit agreement\u201d of October 13, 1930, the company deposited the bonds as security to the city for the due completion of the elevator \u201cprovided the [city] conveys\u201d to the company the said lands shown in black, and it was provided that \u201cshould the [city] convey\u201d said lands to the company and should the company fail to complete the elevator within the time and in the manner provided for, the bonds should be forfeited as liquidated damages, and that \u201cshould the [city] convey\u201d the said lands to the company, then upon due completion of the elevator the bonds were to be delivered back to the company. (By said deposit agreement, the bonds were deposited with the city \u201cand the golf club,\u201d and if the city failed to convey said lands to the company, the deposit was to be as security to the club for the company\u2019s performance of its said purchase from the club, and the bonds were to be forfeited to the club if the company did not, and were to be delivered to the company if it did, carry out that purchase. Owing to the city\u2019s exercise of its said option from the club, the club ceased to have any interest in the bonds). Until default by the company, it was to receive the bond interest coupons. (It did receive those maturing before October 1, 1932).\nBefore or upon execution of the agreements, some work was done on construction, but the company later found itself without sufficient funds to complete the work. The city did not convey the lands\u2014the Crown delayed granting the water lots, and an obstacle came to light against the Crown\u2019s granting its said piece of land included in said \u201clands shown in black,\u201d which obstacle also prevented its grant of the water lots. In answer to enquiry by the city in September, 1931, as to completion, the company replied that reorganization was being effected, and, shortly after, a new company, the plaintiff, took over the company\u2019s assets, but did nothing to complete the elevator. On enquiry by the city in February, 1932, plaintiff replied to the effect that it was making efforts to interest new capital. In September, 1932, plaintiff wrote asking for an extension of two years, and in this letter mentioned that the city had not conveyed the lands. Later plaintiff sued, claiming (inter alia) return of the bonds.\nHeld: Plaintiff was entitled to return of the bonds. Under the terms of the \u201cdeposit agreement,\u201d even in the light of the other documents and all the circumstances, the city\u2019s right to retain them was dependent upon it conveying said \u201clands shown in black.\u201d There was in evidence no conduct of the company which could be considered as a waiver of its right to return of the bonds, or as an estoppel against it. The mere fact that the company itself was in default did not prevent its insisting upon such return (Mayson v. Clouet, [1924] A.C. 980).\nPer Duff C.J., Rinfret and Davis JJ.: The proviso that the city should convey the lands to the company was a condition precedent to the city\u2019s right to retain the bonds; the intention of the parties in this respect being clearly shown by the nature of the subject matter; it was the very basis or essence of the contract whereby the company undertook to deposit the bonds with the city, that the city should convey to it the lands, which were essential in the elevator scheme.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario allowing the defendant\u2019s appeal from the judgment of Makins J. ordering the defendant to deliver certain bonds to the plaintiff and reserving rights to the parties to proceed for damages. The judgment of the Court of Appeal dismissed the action, without prejudice to any claims of the plaintiff (or its assignor) if it could thereafter be shown that the defendant was in default, and without prejudice to claims of any party for damages, and declared that nothing in the judgment should be construed as a declaration that the bonds in question were forfeited to the defendant. The agreements in question and the material facts of the case are sufficiently set out in the judgment of Kerwin J. now reported, and are indicated in the above head-note. The appeal to this Court was allowed and the judgment of the trial judge was restored with costs throughout.\nR.S. Robertson K.C. and Sir William Hearst K.C. for the appellant.\nD.L. McCarthy K.C. and T.J. Rigney K.C. for the respondent.\nDUFF C.J.\u2014I concur in the judgments of Mr. Justice Davis and Mr. Justice Kerwin.\nRINFRET J. concurred with Davis J. and Kerwin J.\nLAMONT J. concurred with Kerwin J.\nDAVIS J. (Concurred with by Duff C.J. and Rinfret J.)\u2014Were it not for the fact that we are reversing a unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal I should be content merely to record my concurrence in the conclusion of my brother Kerwin that the appeal must be allowed and the judgment of the trial judge restored with costs throughout.\nThe point in the appeal is a very simple one. A. delivers certain securities to B. in pursuance of an agreement in writing between them whereby the securities are to be held by B. as security for the completion by A. of a certain grain elevator provided B. conveys or causes or procures to be conveyed to A. certain specified lands for use in connection with the operations of the proposed elevator. B. frankly admits that it has never conveyed nor tendered a conveyance of the lands to A. To me, is it plain that B. cannot retain the securities. The proviso that B. should convey the lands to A. was clearly a condition precedent. No precise form of words is necessary to constitute a condition, and the question whether a particular stipulation in a contract is a condition or not depends entirely upon the proper construction to be placed upon the words in which the particular stipulation is expressed. The intention of the parties is clearly shewn in this case by the nature of the subject-matter to which the stipulation relates. It was the very basis or essence of the contract whereby A. undertook to deposit the securities with B. that B. should convey the lands to A. It is inconceivable that A. would have contracted to deposit these securities on the footing that the conveyance of the lands could be enforced by a cross action for damages only. It was argued that, even if the stipulation be regarded as a condition precedent, A. waived performance of the condition. But there is nothing in the evidence of any conduct by A. that could fairly be calculated to induce B. to believe that the condition need not be performed. The lands in question were essential to the operation of the proposed elevator and I cannot understand the suggestion that there was a waiver of performance of what was plainly an essential in the scheme of the proposed elevator.\nI would allow the appeal and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge with costs throughout.\nKERWIN J. (Concurred in by Duff C.J. and Rinfret and Lamont JJ.)\u2014The Corporation of the City of Kingston and The Canadian Terminal System Limited, being desirous that the latter should erect an elevator in Cataraqui Bay to the west of the city\u2019s limits, carried on negotiations which resulted in three agreements of October 13, 1930. So far as material to this action, the lands bordering on the bay are lots 15 and 16 and the broken front of lots 15 and 16, all in the first concession in the township of Kingston, while the water lots are known as the water lots fronting upon lots 15 and 16. The lots are numbered from west to east. A road known as the front road runs westerly between lot 16 and the broken front of lot 16 and between part of lot 15 and part of broken front lot 15, and then skirts the north shore of the bay where the waters encroach on lot 15. Prior to the date of the agreement, the city had applied to the Provincial Department of Lands and Forests for title to the water lots in front of lots 15 and 16, which title was in the Crown in the right of the province. The city had also secured an option from the Cataraqui Golf and Country Club Limited to purchase all the golf club land, being part of the broken front of lot 16. The title to the small piece of land forming the broken front of lot 15 adjoining the club\u2019s lands was thought to be in the club, or perhaps it is more accurate to state that both parties considered that the club lands extended to the dividing line between lots 15 and 16 in the first concession; but it subsequently transpired that the title to this small piece was also in the Crown in the right of the province and was subject to the provisions of an Ontario statute of 1881 (44 Vict., cap. 38).\nBy the first of the three agreements of October 13, 1930, known as the \u201cCity Agreement\u201d and made between the city and The Canadian Terminal System Limited, after reciting the desire of the parties to enter into an agreement whereby the city would undertake to convey or cause or procure to be conveyed certain lands and lands covered by water to the company, if and as acquired, as a site for the elevator, and to grant or procure a fixed assessment thereon, and whereby the company would agree to construct a grain elevator upon certain parts of the said lands covered by water, and the city would agree to apply to the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontario for a special Act to provide for the fixed assessment and to authorize and validate the agreement; it was provided:\u2014\n1. The company shall construct a transfer and storage elevator of modern design and substantial construction with a storage capacity of not less than 2,500,000 bushels of grain upon that part of the water lots for which application has been made by the corporation to the Crown and fronting upon Lots 15 and 16 in the First Concession of the Township of Kingston, in the County of Frontenac, more particularly described in paragraph 5 hereof, on or before the first day of October, 1932.\n2. The company shall operate and maintain the said elevator for a period of at least ten (10) years immediately after completion, providing such operation and maintenance is not prevented by the intervention of an act of God, vis major, fire, lightning, flood, tempest, explosion, or other cause beyond the reasonable anticipation or control of the company.\n* * *\n5. Subject to such legislative authority and\/or approval, if any, as may be necessary, the corporation shall and will transfer, or cause or procure to be transferred or granted to the company, that part of the water lots for which application has been made by the corporation to the Crown and fronting upon Lots 15 and 16 in the First Concession of the Township of Kingston, County of Frontenac, bordering upon Cataraqui Bay, which may be described as follows: (here follows a description of the proposed site of the elevator).\nA satisfactory deed, grant or conveyance of said portion of said water lots shall be delivered to the company when and so soon as the company has duly executed this agreement and has furnished the bonds provided for in paragraph 7 hereof. The corporation further agrees to likewise transfer and convey, or cause or procure to be transferred and conveyed, to the company the lands shown in black on the said plan attached hereto and described as follows: [here follows a description which takes in not only the northwesterly part of the golf club lands but also the small piece of land forming the broken front of lot 15] provided.... a by-law to be submitted by the corporation to the ratepayers of the municipality under the provisions of the Municipal Act for the purchase of certain lands is duly approved by the said ratepayers.\nThe corporation further agrees to transfer and convey to the Crown in the right of the Dominion of Canada for dredging purposes for the proposed elevator, such parts of said water lots as it may acquire, as are shown coloured green on the plan hereto attached and marked.\nProvided, however, that the Cataraqui Golf and Country Club, Limited (hereinafter referred to as the \u201cGolf Club\u201d) shall have the right to use and occupation of those parts of said Lot Sixteen (16) now owned by said golf club until the first day of December, 1931, free of charge.\n* * *\n7. The company shall deposit with the corporation and the golf club sixty thousand dollars ($60,000) par value twenty-year first mortgage (leasehold) sinking fund gold bonds, Series A, of National Utilities Corporation, Limited, the property of the company, free of all liens and charges, duly endorsed by the company to the corporation and the golf club, as security for the due construction and completion of said elevator, together with the necessary wharfage and dockage facilities for the proper operation and use of the same, in the event of the corporation conveying or causing or procuring to be conveyed to the company the lands coloured black on the plan attached hereto as provided for in paragraph 5 hereof; and in the event of the failure of said corporation to convey or cause or procure to be conveyed to the company said lands as aforesaid then, as security for the purchase by the said company from the golf club of the lands mentioned in a certain agreement between the said city and the said golf club bearing even date herewith in accordance in all respects with the provisions of said agreement; such bonds to be deposited subject to all the terms, conditions and provisions particularly set forth in a Deposit Agreement, bearing even date herewith, between the company, the corporation and the said golf club.\n8. The corporation or its nominee shall have the right of free use of any railway siding now or hereafter constructed in common with the company, upon entering into a satisfactory agreement in respect of such joint use.\n9. The corporation shall make application to the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontario at the next session thereof for a special Act granting or making provision for granting a fixed assessment of the said elevator and the lands, trackage, and docks connected therewith, including business assessment, for the period of ten years next following the first day of January after the completion of said elevator, at the sum of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) (but this shall not apply to or affect taxation for school purposes or local improvements) and dispensing with all provisions requiring the submission of a by-law to the electors of said corporation of any other municipality for the purpose of so fixing said assessment. In the event of said assessment not being so fixed by special Act, the corporation will through its council submit to the electors of the municipality and endeavour to secure the passage of a proper by-law under the provisions of the Municipal Act for the purpose of so fixing the said assessment. 10. The corporation shall also make application to the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontario at said next session thereof for the enactment of provisions in said special Act or in another special Act, authorizing, validating and confirming this agreement and all the terms and provisions thereof and all things done and to be done pursuant thereto or in connection therewith.\nThe second of the agreements of October 13, 1930, known as the \u201cGolf Club Agreement,\u201d was made between the club and the company, and, after reciting the option granted by the club to the city, provided:\u2014\n1. In the event of the corporation failing to exercise its said option with the club for the purchase of the lands therein described, then and in such case said club hereby agrees to sell and convey the said lands covered by said option and certain water lots hereinafter referred to, to the company and the company agrees to purchase the same for the price or sum of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) cash.\n2. The lands to be conveyed by the club to the company in the event of the corporation failing to exercise its said option, as aforesaid, may be more particularly described as follows: that is to say: Those parts of the broken front in front of Lots Numbers Fifteen and Sixteen (15 and 16) in the First Concession of the Township of Kingston, County of Frontenac, lying south of the travelled road now owned by the club, and all such water lots as the club may be entitled to have conveyed to it by the said corporation under an agreement bearing even date herewith, between the club and the said corporation, a copy of which agreement is hereto attached as Schedule \u201cB\u201d to this agreement, subject, however, to the right which is hereby expressly reserved for the free use and occupation by the club of said part of Lot Sixteen (16) to December 1, 1931, with the exception of such portion of said lot as lies in the immediate vicinity of the present eleventh green as may be required for the purposes of dredging for the proposed elevator. Provided also that the club shall have the right to remove any of the soil it may see fit to remove before the completion of the purchase without compensation to the company.\nIt is to be noted that, if this agreement became operative by reason of the city failing to exercise its option, the old company was entitled to purchase for $50,000, not merely the northwesterly part of the broken front of lot 16 (which is all it was entitled to under the last part of clause 5 of the City Agreement), but all of said broken front lot 16 owned by the club. It must also be remembered that, while clause 2 of the \u201cGolf Club Agreement\u201d mentions lots 15 and 16, there follows the words \u201cnow owned by the club.\u201d\nClause 3 of the \u201cGolf Club Agreement\u201d is as follows:\u2014\n3. The company shall deposit with the corporation and the golf club sixty thousand dollars ($60,000) par value twenty-year first mortgage (leasehold) sinking fund gold bonds, Series A, of National Utilities Corporation Limited, the property of the company, free of all liens and charges, duly endorsed by the company to the corporation and the golf club (as security for the due construction and completion of said elevator, together with the necessary wharfage and dockage facilities for the proper operation and use of the same in the event of the corporation conveying or causing or procuring to be conveyed to the company the lands coloured black on the plan attached to a certain agreement bearing even date herewith between the said corporation and the company; and in the event of the failure of said corporation to convey or cause or procure to be conveyed to the company said lands as aforesaid, then, as security for the purchase by the said company from the golf club of the lands mentioned in a certain agreement between the said city and the said golf club bearing even date herewith in accordance in all respects with the provisions of said agreement, such bonds to be deposited subject to all the terms, conditions, and provisions particularly set forth in a Deposit Agreement, bearing even date herewith, between the company, the corporation and the said golf club.\nThe agreement referred to as schedule \u201cB\u201d is dated September 16, 1930, and was made between the city and the golf club, and provides that, in consideration of the club waiving its rights to patents to certain water lots adjacent to lot 16 in the first concession in favour of the city, the latter agrees that in the event of its failure to exercise its option to purchase the golf club land, it would transfer to the club all the water lots that it should acquire from the province lying east of the westerly limit of lot 16 except such part as the city has by agreement of even date agreed to transfer to the Canadian Terminal System Limited and to the Dominion for dredging purposes.\nThe progress of the negotiations is evidenced by the reference to an agreement \u201cof even date,\u201d whereas as a matter of fact, the \u201cCity Agreement,\u201d as has been shown, was not dated until October 13, 1930. The necessity of the agreement of September 16, 1930, was that the Crown would not grant title to any water lots except to the riparian owners or their nominees and the club had so nominated the city.\nThe third agreement of October 13, 1930, called the \u201cDeposit Agreement,\u201d is between the company, the city and the club. As the first point argued before us depends largely upon the construction of this document, it is imperative to consider all its terms which are as follows:\nWhereas by agreement bearing even date herewith, between the company and the corporation (which said agreement is hereinafter referred to as the \u201cCity Agreement\u201d), the company has agreed to construct an elevator with a storage capacity of not less than 2,500,000 bushels on the lands in said agreement described, together with the necessary wharfage and dockage facilities for the proper operation and use of the same, on or before the first day of October, 1932, subject to the terms, provisoes, conditions and stipulations in said agreement contained, a copy of which Agreement is attached hereto as Schedule \u201cA\u201d to this Agreement.\nAnd whereas by Agreement bearing date the 25th day of August, 1930, between the golf club and the corporation (which said Agreement is hereinafter referred to as the \u201cOption Agreement\u201d), the said golf club granted to the corporation an option or right to purchase certain lands of the said golf club in the Option Agreement described at the price and upon the terms in said Option Agreement set forth, a copy of which Option Agreement is attached hereto as Schedule \u201cB\u201d to this Agreement.\nAnd whereas by Agreement bearing even date herewith, between the said company and the said golf club (hereinafter referred to as the \u201cGolf Club Agreement\u201d), it is provided that in the event of the corporation failing to exercise said option, the golf club shall sell and convey to the company, and the company shall purchase the lands covered by said option and certain water lots in said Golf Club Agreement referred to, at and for the price or sum of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) cash, a copy of which Golf Club Agreement is attached hereto as Schedule \u201cC\u201d to this Agreement.\nAnd whereas the company has agreed to and with the corporation and the golf club to deposit sixty thousand dollars ($60,000) par value of twenty-year first mortgage (leasehold) sinking fund gold bonds, Series A, of National Utilities Corporation Limited, as security for the due construction of said elevator in the event of the corporation conveying or causing or procuring to be conveyed to the company the lands shown in black on the plan attached to said City Agreement in the manner provided in said City Agreement, and in the event of the city failing to convey said lands as aforesaid, as security for the purchase by the company from the golf club of the lands mentioned in said Golf Club Agreement in accordance in all respects with the provisions of said Golf Club Agreement.\nNow this Agreement witnesseth:\n1. That the company hereby delivers to and deposits with the corporation and the golf club sixty thousand dollars ($60,000) par value of twenty-year first mortgage (leasehold) sinking funds gold bonds, Series A, of National Utilities Corporation Limited, which said bonds are the property of the company free of all liens and charges, as security to the corporation for the due completion by the company of said elevator, together with the necessary wharfage and dockage facilities for the proper operation and use of the same in the manner and within the time provided for by said City Agreement provided the corporation conveys, or causes or procures to be conveyed to the company, the said lands shown in black on the plan attached to said City Agreement in the manner provided in said City Agreement, and in the event of the failure of the corporation to convey said lands to the company, in accordance with the provisions of said City Agreement, then and in such case as security to the golf club for the purchase by the company from the golf club of the lands mentioned in said Golf Club Agreement in accordance in all respects with the provisions of said Agreement.\n2. Should the Corporation convey, or cause or procure to be conveyed to the company, the lands mentioned in the preceding paragraph hereof in accordance with the provisions of said City Agreement, and should the company fail to complete said elevator, together with the necessary wharfage and dockage facilities for the proper operation and use of the same, within the time and in the manner provided for in the said City Agreement, then and in such case said bonds shall become forfeited to and be the absolute property of the corporation as and by way of liquidated damages and not as a penalty. Should the corporation fail to convey said lands to the company as aforesaid and should the company fail to complete the purchase of the lands referred to in the Golf Club Agreement as in said Golf Club Agreement provided, then and in such event said bonds shall become forfeited to and be the absolute property of the golf club as and by way of liquidated damages and not as a penalty.\n3. It is distinctly understood and agreed between the parties hereto that the company shall not be or be deemed to be in default in any way under said Golf Club Agreement unless and until the corporation fails to exercise the option in said Option Agreement provided and one month\u2019s notice of such failure has been given to the company in the manner hereinafter provided. It being the intention and meaning of this Agreement that said bonds shall at the expiration of one month from the giving of the aforementioned notice, cease in any way to be the property of the company unless within that period the company has performed and discharged all its obligations with respect to the purchase of the said lands mentioned in said Golf Club Agreement as provided for by said Golf Club Agreement.\n4. The company shall have the right and privilege at any time before default on its part in any of the conditions herein contained to have said bonds delivered to it upon depositing with the corporation and the golf club in lieu thereof, the sum of forty thousand dollars ($40,000) in cash or a satisfactory surety bond for a like amount, such cash or surety bond to stand in the place of said bonds and be subject to all the conditions and stipulations herein contained.\n5. Should the corporation convey to the company the said lands in manner aforesaid, then and in such case upon the completion of said elevator, together with the necessary wharfage and dockage facilities for the proper operation and use of the same in the manner and within the time provided for in said Agreement, the corporation and the golf club shall deliver to the company said bonds, or said cash or surety bond deposited in lieu thereof under the provisions of the preceding paragraph hereof, free and discharged of and from all claims and demands of the corporation or the golf club, or either of them. Should the corporation fail to convey said lands in manner aforesaid and the company perform and discharge all its obligations with respect to the purchase of said lands mentioned in said Golf Club Agreement, as provided for by said Golf Club Agreement, then and in such case the corporation and the golf club shall immediately upon the completion of said purchase by the company, deliver to the company said bonds or said cash or surety bond free and discharged of and from all claims and demands of the corporation or the golf club, or either of them.\n6. Until default shall occur on the part of the company, the company shall be entitled to have delivered to it the interest coupons attached to said bonds when and as the same shall become due and payable, and in case of the substitution of cash for said bonds, such cash shall be deposited with some bank or trust company in a special account in the name of the corporation and all interest payable in respect of said moneys shall be paid to the company until default shall occur hereunder.\n7. Any notice required to be given hereunder may be given by registered letter addressed \u201cThe Canadian Terminal System Limited, Canadian Pacific Building, Toronto, Ontario.\u201d 8. This Agreement shall be binding upon and ensure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.\nEven before the execution of the agreements of October 13, 1930, the company had entered into an agreement with a contractor under which the latter transported certain material for the erection of the elevator to a spot presumably near the site of the proposed elevator. If not prior to October 13, 1930, certainly immediately afterwards, the contractor commenced work on the foundations and continued until severe winter weather set in. For this, the company paid the contractor a very substantial sum of money.\nThe city council submitted to the ratepayers a by-law to authorize the purchase of the golf club lands, and, upon it being carried, exercised its option, and on December 29, 1930, obtained a conveyance of these lands from the club. The city had also continued to press its application to the Crown Lands Department for the grant of part of the water lots to itself and for a grant of the remainder of the water lots to the Crown in the right of the Dominion so that the Dominion Department of Public Works might complete the dredging operations which it had already commenced.\nMatters were in this position when the Provincial Minister of Lands and Forests was advised in a letter from the solicitors of the village of Portsmouth of certain claims by that municipality on behalf of its residents for access to Cataraqui Bay over broken front lot 15, and apparently based on the provisions of the statute of 1881. This claim effectively prevented, and still prevents, the granting of the city\u2019s application for conveyances of the water lots, and also brought to light the fact that the title to broken front lot 15 was still in the Crown in the right of the province, subject to whatever privileges arose under the statute. The city, however, did secure a special Act of the Legislature, validating the agreements and extending the limits of the city so as to include the site of the proposed elevator and other adjoining lands and water lots but was unsuccessful in having included therein the authority to grant a fixed assessment. The city also paid the sum of $2,665.50 to the Department of Lands and Forests for the water lots. The coupons on the bonds deposited by the company with the city and golf club that were payable on March 15, 1931, were sent by the city to the company in April of that year. The company found itself without sufficient funds to complete the project, although, so far as appears, not as a result of any difficulty to obtain title to broken front lot 15 or to the water lots upon which the foundations of the elevator had been constructed. On September 14, 1931, the city clerk wrote the company stating that the citizens were anxious that the elevator should be completed and asked for information. The reply pointed out that a reorganization was being effected. This materialized when by an agreement of September 17, 1931, the plaintiff company in this action took over all the assets of the old company, including whatever rights the latter had in the bonds. The new company has done nothing to complete the elevator. The coupons on the bonds that were payable in September, 1931, were sent to the new company on November 7, 1931.\nPossibly because of the uncertainty as to the completion of the elevator, a by-law to grant a fixed assessment was not submitted to the ratepayers of the municipality at the time of the 1931 municipal elections, and on February 15, 1932, the city clerk wrote the new company for information, to which the president replied on February 16, 1932, to the effect that the company was making efforts to interest new capital. In April and September of that year, the half-yearly coupons on the bonds were sent to the new company, and in the interval the Crown Lands Department was asked by the city as to what progress was being made in connection with the city\u2019s application for conveyances of the water lots.\nFinally on September 29, 1932, the company wrote the city asking for an extension of two years to complete the elevator, and although the former manager of the old company stated at the trial on cross-examination that on several occasions he had asked the city for title to the golf club lands, this is the first letter in which appears the statement that while the bonds had been deposited, the city had not conveyed the lands. The request for an extension of time was submitted to a committee of the city council and referred to the city solicitor, but what decision was arrived at does not appear; the last notification, according to the evidence, being that the solicitor notified the company that he had reported to the city and would require its instructions before replying further. This was followed by a demand for the return of the bonds.\nIn its pleading, the plaintiff makes a number of claims, but at the trial, the sole question entertained was as to the right of the plaintiff to obtain the bonds from the defendant. It is true that was done against the objection of counsel for the defendant, but the Court of Appeal has similarly dealt with the matter and that is all, therefore, that falls to be determined in this appeal.\nThe document that specifically deals with the deposit of the bonds is the \u201cDeposit Agreement\u201d of October 13, 1930. The final recital speaks of the company\u2019s agreement to deposit the bonds\nas security for the due construction of said elevator in the event of the Corporation conveying or causing or procuring to be conveyed to the Company the lands shown in black on the plan attached to said City Agreement in the manner provided in said City Agreement, and in the event of the City failing to convey said lands as aforesaid, as security for the purchase by the Company from the Golf Club of the lands mentioned in said Golf Club Agreement in accordance in all respects with the provisions of said Golf Club Agreement.\nClause (1), after providing for the deposit of the bonds as security for the completion by the company of the elevator, etc., continues:\u2014\nprovided the Corporation conveys, or causes or procures to be conveyed to the Company, the said lands shown in black on the plan attached to said City Agreement in the manner provided in said City Agreement, and in the event of the failure of the Corporation to convey said lands to the Company, in accordance with the provisions of said City Agreement, then and in such case as security to the Golf Club for the purchase by the Company from the Golf Club of the lands mentioned in said Golf Club Agreement in accordance in all respects with the provisions of said Agreement.\nThe \u201cCity Agreement\u201d provides for the conveyance to the company of part of the golf club lands and part of broken front lot 15. It is quite true that the conveyance could not be made until title should be acquired and the necessary legislative authority secured, but it will be observed that the bonds were deposited only in connection with the lands shown in black on the plan. If the city did not exercise its option from the golf club, then it would have no further interest in the bonds which would remain with the club as security for the purchase by the company of the latter\u2019s lands (presuming for the moment that the \u201cClub Agreement\u201d refers only to lands \u201cnow owned by the club\u201d as stated, and not to any part of broken front lot 15 which the club did not own). In that event, upon the company paying $50,000, it would secure all the club\u2019s lands and all the water lots that the club might secure from the city, and would be entitled to the return of the bonds. By reason of the city exercising its option, the golf club ceased to have any interest in the bonds. The city owns all of broken front lot 16 which it agreed to convey to the company, but no title to broken front lot 15. The company has neither bonds nor title. With great respect, I consider the terms of the \u201cDeposit Agreement,\u201d even in the light of the other documents and all the circumstances, to be clear that the city\u2019s right to retain the bonds is dependent upon it giving a grant of the lands shown in black on the plan.\nThe company having a right to the bonds under the agreement, I am unable to find that anything that has transpired could be considered as a waiver of that right. Waiver must be based on new contract or estoppel. No new agreement has been suggested, and in fact, a request by the new company for an extension of time to complete the elevator was not granted by the city. As to estoppel, neither company made any representations, verbal or written or by conduct, and certainly none that were acted upon by the city to its prejudice. After the construction of the foundations of the elevator, all parties endeavoured to have the title to the various parcels of land and the water lots transferred to the designated grantees, but no obligation rested upon either company to demand earlier than was done that the city hand over the bonds. The mere fact that the company itself is admittedly in default does not prevent its insisting upon the return of the bonds. Mayson v. Clouet[1]. It may be that the city and the old company have valid claims for damages against each other, but with that we are not concerned in this action; and on the argument the appellant abandoned any claim for specific performance.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs in this Court and the Court of Appeal, and the judgment of the learned trial judge restored.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Hearst & Hearst.\nSolicitor for the respondent: T.J. Rigney.\n[1] [1924] A.C. 980.\n",
